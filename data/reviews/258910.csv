The opposition leader isn’t satisfied with the results of the election, he’s started a smear campaign on the V.P. that has everyone riled up. Despite these problems he goes out of his way to help out the citizens with their problems. He’s embroiled in a mystery that includes strange animals wandering the forests, and coffee makers that attack the patrons.\n\nLiked\n\nEarthbound Style – The creators of Citizens of Earth were clearly inspired by the great Mother/Earthbound series. It capitalizes on the visual presentation of minimalist first-person battles with text flowing above screen. It has its own sense of wacky characters from the over-the-top Vice President to the insane ramblings of the school mascot.\n\nGotta Catch Em’ All – Even with the resemblance to Earthbound, the game has a distinct similarity to the Pokemon series. As the V.P. you’re set to push citizens around with your powerful ways. Your job is to meander about town running into wacky personas and recruiting them to do your bidding. Each citizen has their own set of skills and strengths and weaknesses. They can easily be swapped in and out according to the situation, so there is plenty of fun to be had with each.\n\nGreat Voiceover – Every person in Citizens of Earth has a voice and they’re all great and capture the characters on screen wonderfully. Not every person has spoken dialogue in every situation, but the 75 percent that do sure are great to listen to.\n\nPricing – Citizens of Earth is a full-fledged RPG that captures the 16-bit era of games perfectly. It’s hard to argue with the price of $15 for hours of JRPG fun… even if the game has some drawbacks.\n\nCould be better\n\nJRPG Essence – I like Citizens of Earth… but that’s about as far as I can go with it. It doesn’t really break any walls down for the RPG genre. It takes a lot of pride in its comedy which is hit and miss, but the recruiting of Citizens breaks down to the monotony of fetch quests. Find this, kill that, it’s all rudimentary after a few battles. Within two or so hours of playing, I was already bored of what felt like a “grind” and that’s just not right.\n\nNot only that, but the combat system is a little too basic for my tastes. It makes no attempts at differentiating itself from any other RPG that ever existed before it. I love Earthbound but somehow playing the same combat system in Citizens doesn’t have the same appeal. My only assumption to my feelings it that I remember Earthbound from 1994, and sadly it’s 2015 and I’d expect a staggering upgrade in the combat system by then.\n\nLoad Times Vita – Loading is buttery smooth on the PC but the Vita takes some time to move in and out of buildings. It’s a 5 to 6 seconds difference, but it’s noticeable since you move through different zones constantly. Other than the loading issue, the games are virtually the same.\n\nDisliked\n\nSoundtrack – It’s not that I hate the Soundtrack per se, it’s just that it isn’t that impressive for an RPG. Seeing as this game was inspired by the Mother series, you’d think it could do a little better with the musical choices. Sadly, there were times where the music began to grate or simply cutout completely after a combat sequence.\n\nThe world – Citizens of Earth has some great characters but the world is a bit too sanitary. The visuals are crisp enough to take a delicious bite out of, but the environments lack an artistic flair. At times I could confuse the design with that of a flash game. For a game that’s trying to capture the 16-bit essence, it lacks that artful variation that breathes life into different zones. The level design was clearly created for travel and not to stop to smell the roses.\n\nCan’t skip messages – There is one thing I can’t stand in RPG’s, and that’s not being able to skip arbitrary messages. You can’t do that in Citizens of Earth, you’re forced to listen to the V.P. make snide comments during battle and enjoy lingering messages of enemies dropping items. It’s a small little thing, but man if it isn’t an annoyance when grinding.\n\nConclusion\n\nComedy has a place in video games and Citizen of Earth does tickle that fancy completely. As an RPG… it tries to mimic Earthbound and Pokemon, but falls short of the heights that those two titles reached. I recommend you wait for a sale before becoming the Vice President of the World. Citizens of Earth emulates the Mother series closely, but fails to show its own heart in the process. I’m not saying it’s a bad RPG, but nothing about the story or the combat had me playing it for more than a couple hours a day.","January 20, 2015","true","12.5"," 112 of 144 people (78%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","78","112","144","11","0"

Kits at the time.\nPlease leave a like and let the gaming industry know, that we want more games like this. Quality, games that don’t have glitches destroying the game, no dlc patches, and no BS copy-right policies.\nWe want more Citizens of EARTH!\n","January 20, 2015","true","11.5"," 91 of 129 people (71%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","71","91","129","11","6"

As the World's VP it's your job to make the citizens of Earth happy folk and make sure they get what they want, after all that's what they elected you for. Over the course of your journey to make the citizens happy you'll come across many citizens willing to help you as well as plenty of people and monsters who want nothing more than to spoil your day.\n\n+Nice and colourful cartoon style graphics\n+Fantastic voice acting which fits perfectly with the game, in particular the voice actor who plays the VP himself\n+An interesting, far-fetched plot which will see you doing all kinds of things from trying to get rid of protestors to trying to track down a flying cofffe shop\n+A huge number of citizens to recruit, each with their own side-mission which must be completed for them to join you\n+Great humour and hilarious dialogue lines throughout\n+A wide variety of enemy types\n+Quite a few different environments to explore\n+Simple turn-based combat that often provides a good challenge, especially when fighting more than one enemy or when fighting a boss. Your party members also have energy requirements for certain moves (energy is built up by using your weaker attacks) which prevents you from using the same strong attack over and over again\n+Each character has a number of different attacks, many of which are unlocked as they level up and no two characters have the same moves which means each character has their own, unique fighting style\n+You are able to modify the difficulty during a playthrough by visiting a certain character or by talking to him when he is in your party, increasing the difficult rewards you with more money and more EXP while lowering the difficulty does the opposite\n+You can name your party members whatever you want which can be rather amusing if you like that kind of thing\n\n-The backgrounds when in combat are a bit strange and usually consist of moving colour patterns, I would have preferred the backgrounds from the environment to be used\n-There were far too many random encounters for my liking and they are almost impossible to avoid and fleeing from fights is almost impossible as you always have very low chances of success\n-Dialogue lines which repeat when triggered by doing something such as finding an item get repetitive and irritating very quickly such as "Capitalism at its finest" when picking up an item of food\n\nWorth a Mention:\n-Not really worthy of a negative but the menus all have Xbox controller prompts even when using KB&M which I thought was a little odd\n\nVerdict:\n8\n\nA super fun comedic RPG, with a huge number of characters unlock, a funny plot and great turn-based combat, I highly recommend this game for fans of similar RPGs.\n\nEl K.","April 3, 2015","true","11.3"," 59 of 80 people (74%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","74","59","80","5","7"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/NeoRizer/recommended/258910/","NeoRizer","NeoRizer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/NeoRizer/","368 products in account","YES it's an Earthbound / Mother clone.\n\nYES it pays tribute and references Earthbound / Mother every chance it gets.\n\nNO it doesn't live up to our high expectations and\n\nNO it doesn't surpass the greatness that is Earthbound / Mother... like doesn't even come close.\n\nBUT if you're craving some Earthbound / Mother without repeating those same games for the 100th time, it's a nice change of pace.\n\nCitizens of Earth does pay huge tribute to the Earthbound / Mother series and for that I am greatful.\n\nEarthbound was a sleeper hit game on the SNES back in the early to mid 90's that capitalized on doing something different, making fun of Western culture and using the same sterotypes we saw in JRPG games at the time...\n\nOnce the dawning of the internet occured and more information spread it obtained cult following status and at this point, legendary status as one of the best JRPG's of the Silver Age of gaming. This is exactly why Citizens of Earth tries so hard to emulate the feeling, it wants to be great. Does it reach it's lofty goal? Hell no... but it's still a fun game and a love letter to Earthbound fans across the globe.\n\nShould you buy it at 15 dollars? I'd say, if you're incredibly desperate for a retro style RPG and a huge retro style world to explore, then yes, definitely YES. I can already tell this game is going to need an entire weekend to fully enjoy properly. To those of you not in touch with your inner child, you've lived a sad and depraved childhood and for that I pity you... but there's always time to change. :)\n\nYou can't really play this game in stints, you really need to sit down and make some time to be enthralled by it to fully enjoy it and that's exactly how Earthbound worked... You need to let yourself be absorbed by the world within, unfortunately Earthbound almost immediately draws you in where Citizens of Earth takes some time.\n\nThe plot is rather weak to begin with and it seems like the fun comes from recruiting characters from the 40 character roster... There's plenty to explore and a lot of questing to do so the content to price ratio is fair.\n\nWhere does the game fall short? The music is rather quirky, but not in the good kind of way like Earthbound was... It tries too hard to be weird and ends up kind of falling flat... Although some areas definitely have some pretty cool tunes, none of it is Earthbound worthy though.\n\nThe character recruitment can get a bit overwhelming, there's a lot of characters to try and you really don't know who's going to be good in the long run.  I find comitting to a specific set of characters is fairly tough, especially when you have so many to choose from. The level up bonus' you receive from having specific characters in your group at the time of leveling up also really hurts the grind a bit. It's an OCD nightmare for hardcore gamers who love to min / max their characters... basically if you don't set up characters to synergize properly, it's wasted potential... over the course of 100 level ups, it could mean the difference of being able to conquer the 4X difficulty setting for the masocists.\n\nThis kind of makes the game suffer a bit in the lasting appeal department, you really can't get attached to any one character other than your brother, who seems to be one of the best all around characters to have. You'll be constantly switching out the other two characters to work around your brother's strengths.\n\nI can tell a lot of work went in to the character creation so I can't knock it too hard but it seems like it could of been toned down a bit. I would of rather had 4 to 6 solid characters to choose from and left it at that but then it would of threw the entire theme of the game out the window so it's a bit hit and miss in my opinion.\n\nEither way, it's a meaty game, probably around the same size / length as Earthbound, except this game seems to be a lot less linear from the start. It's best to just follow the main quest line until you can get some quick travel going because walking around in this game is just abysmally boring which was another gripe of mine... There's plenty of places to visit but if you hit a dead end, expect to want to just quit and take a break because the hike back in the other direction is enough to just turn you off completely.\n\nAll in all, recommended to those craving a taste of the good old days of gaming.

Today I've finally finished it, including recruiting all the citizens (I'm a completionist), and am ultimately left disappointed. Much like the character of the Vice President (VP) of the World that you play as, I found this game initially appealing but shallow once you dig in a little.\n\nMy biggest complaint has be the direction they chose to go in designing the recruitable characters. Most are caricatures based on common stereotypes and much of the comedy is too. Some examples: the Car Salesman is a slick sleazebag, somewhere along the way the Cop will mention donuts and the Artist will talk about happy trees. It's predictable and, as I mentioned before, shallow. With such a large cast of playable characters it's not unexpected that many of them don't get a chance to build depth, but that doesn't excuse that I never felt attached to any of them besides the VP. This isn't to say that there aren't any good moments, there are, there just aren't enough of them.\n\nFrom a combat standpoint there is a lot of variation among the citizens, leaving you plenty of room to get creative with your party setup. Equipment is very limited but each has the potential to significantly change how you'll want to use that character and who to team them with. For example, an offensive character might be able to be equiped with something that doubles their attack but also halves their defense. You might accept this tradeoff if you pair them with a teammate that is able to protect them.\n\nSimilar to Earthbound, battles aren't the highlight of the game. They can be enjoyable at times or tedious and repetitive at others. With the large cast you're bound to have many under leveled members as well as some potentially over leveled favorites. Difficulty is largely left up to you, either by directly altering it with the special talent of the Mascot character or by choosing lower level members for your party. That can make it tough to consistently find a good balance between challenging and cakewalk.\n\nVisually the game is pleasing to the eye. I'm particularly fond of the style of the citizens and enemies. The world has many areas to explore but loses some beauty points with its tendency toward vertical and horizontal lines. Also hurting the good looks was frequent screen tearing and no V-sync option available to remedy this. While on the topic of game performance issues, the game crashed on me numerous times throughout my time with it. The autosave feature made it so I rarely lost more than a few minutes of progress, but it's still distressing.\n\nThe soundtrack is another area of great disappointment. It tries to emulate the quirky style of Earthbound. Unfortunately its tunes aren't able to breathe the same life into the places they accompany. None of the music is grating, it's just very forgettable.\n\nDespite some good aspects to this game and my appreciation for where the developers hearts were at in making this, I cannot recommend it. If you're dying to play a comedy heavy RPG that's not part of the Mother series then maybe give this a shot but keep your expectations low.\n\n5/10","October 14, 2015","false","23.7"," 41 of 59 people (69%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","69","41","59","4","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/spamb0t/recommended/258910/","spamb0t","spamb0t","http://steamcommunity.com/id/spamb0t/","1021 products in account","My review from: ResPwnd[respwnd.com]\n\n\nIf there’s anything besides zombies that is flooding the PC market at the moment it has to be cheap RPGMaker games. Not all are crap, but a lot of them. Citizens of Earth from creator Eden Industries (Waveform) is not an RPGMaker game, so one might wonder why I bring this up. Well, for two reasons. First of all it certainly does pay homage to the same kind of retro RPG titles as a lot of RPGMaker games do and the gameplay is in many ways very similar. The other reason why is the fact that in the midst of this over-saturated retro RPG market Citizens of Earth rise above this pile of ♥♥♥♥♥ and do its own unique take on the tired genre while also adding some interesting design choices. In the veins of PA Adventures: On the Rain-slick Precipice of Darkness and Deathspank the game is brimming with silliness and exercises in the bizarre.\n\nYou play the Vice President of the Earth, a self-indulgent, unlikable, and incompetent politician (or should I perhaps just say “a politician”) who take to the streets and have to battle hecklers, stop signs, emo thunderclouds, heaps of leaves, popcorns, joggers, and hippies (just to name a few of the enemies from a very funny and quite insane ensemble) on his way to his meeting with the President. When the President of Earth soon thereafter turns up missing, the VP slowly realizes that something odd is going on. Suddenly that coffee franchise that took to the skies earlier seem a lot less innocent, for instance. This takes you and you compadres, a wide array of Citizens, on a journey through deserts, eerie (well, no, still silly) forests, cemeteries, camps, and a lot of other places on a quest to find the President and uncover a sinister plot.\n\nWhile in no ways a technical masterpiece, the game looks great for its genre. It has a clean and neat art style without feeling half-done or rushed. A lot of its design practically screams Nintendo with its smoothness and big and colorful buttons (that sometimes won’t render until you try to select one or the other using your controller or keyboard). The game is in fact available on the Wii U and the 3DS. Despite this, it retains the simple retro RPG game design that we all know by now. Citizens of Earth is an engaging game, but it suffers from some segments that involves far too many battles, something that can make the game feel like very “grind-y” (I’m looking at you, chapter 3!). It’s not fun when you can’t walk for more than 10 seconds between every battle, especially battles that are far too easy. Because I get that the game is a lot about the turn based fighting, but I want the battles to feel like they serve a purpose instead of just having them thrown in my face while taking a stroll in the big city. If I wanted to grind, I would grind! And on that note, you will have to grind to be able to level up the forty (40!!!) different party members, or Citizens, that you can recruit. Fortunately, if you have the money, you can put them in school to make them level up all by them selves. Every recruitable citizen has a talent, and while these might sound a bit odd I find some of these little talents very charming – especially the Beekeeper who let’s you zoom in or out or the School Mascot that let’s you change difficulty at the cost or benefit of earned XP. You can also fast travel using the Pilot, and avoid some of the more tedious battles (and a long hike) by letting the Car Salesman conjure up a car for you. Still, you can only drive on the roads and most enemies tend to cluster off-road anyway. Some of the game options you usually find in the “options” menu are actually citizen talents, with the exception of resolution, shaders, sound, the option to play in full screen versus windowed mode (there is no borderless), and using multithreaded mode. As stated, this is no technical masterpiece and doesn’t offer anything groundbreaking. Still it offers dynamic reflection and shader effect that a lot of similar titles don’t, and its somewhat unique art style gives the game a personality that manages to charm the player. However despite being patched both prior to (i.e. while doing most of my review) and after its release, the game still suffers from some unexpected crashes now and then. I will say they are rare but they can of course be frustrating and cause you to lose data even with the game’s functional autosave feature. And let’s face it – of course they shouldn’t still be there post launch.\n\nCitizens of Earth really hits the mark with a lot of its satirical humor but it is a pretty long game and one-liners and the repetitive combat oriented gameplay can become tedious after a while. Sure there are a lot of places to explore and discover but mostly it just leads you to Citizens that you can recruit. How is not always obvious, and some I found to be annoyingly vague (don’t get me started on the Weather Lady). The storytelling is however good and with a story that goes absolutely bonkers by the end it is still pretty damn funny and bizarre experience. So when it all comes down to it – did I have fun playing Citizens of Earth? The answer is yes. Sure, it’s tedious and frustrating at times and while you can recruit forty Citizens to join your party, chances are you’ll grow to like three of them and stick with them for as long as possible. In addition to those you might have some substitutes for certain fights as enemies have both weaknesses and strengths and some tactics are needed to beat them. Then again, the people you don’t use for battles still have those useful talents I spoke of earlier which can help you out in other ways, like the Architect and the Gardener who you will need to access certain areas. The wide selection of recruitable party members might also give players more freedom to play the game the way that fits them best. All in all, Citizens of Earth entertains yet at a somewhat uneven rate.\n\nPlus:\nSucceeds in its humor and satire\nSilly but nonetheless good storytelling\nCharming art style\nMyriads of party members and features make for a diverse experience\n\nMinus\nThe same myriads of features make some of them seem pointless\nBecomes tedious grinding at certain points in the story\nStill suffers from some crashes post release\n\nScore: 69 / 100","January 22, 2015","true","22.8"," 14 of 19 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","14","19","0","0"

For me, it started off strong but rapidly deteriorated into the opposite.\n\nThe vast majority of characters are extraordinarily one-dimensional and never evolve in any narrative way.  The combat is old school, but in the way that it emphasizes everything that has been improved over the years as opposed to appealing to our rose colored glasses.  The story itself, in my humble opinion, couldn't even begin to compete with the classic games that Citizens of Earth was inspired by and involved far too much grinding to progress.\n\nIt was enjoyable to collect characters, for the most part, and leveling them was exciting as far as abilities are concerned as each new ability tended to add something new role-wise that the character hadn't previously had access to.\n\nI can't recommend this game for the Earthbound fans who are looking for an exciting modern version, but as an RPG-lite this may appeal to some who are looking for something that has the simple RPG feel of years long lost.","May 15","false","9.5"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

And every character has different abilities based on who they are, such as baker can bake a bun to heal hp, throw flour to reduce AGI, use a heat based attack and the mum can scold to lower enemy defense etc. and they each have a different talent such as the baker has a bakery shop talent so you can buy baked goods that heal, revive, raise stats and the pilot who can fly you around the world.\n\nI like this game a lot, like the variety of characters and the different abilities they have.\nI like the gameplay, art style, combat and crazy JRPG  enemies and bosses style. The humour is silly and can be childish.\n\nDislike there is no world map which makes it hard to know where to go at times leaving you wandering in circles and there are also plenty of locations without any area map and vague quest descriptions making you unsure what to do next such as go south of your hometown and whisperwood is directly south of hometown, but nope nothing happens or progresses the quest there and you have to actually go south of whisperwood to get to the Executive Retreat so the quest description should of been go  fartherest south of your hometown past  Whisperwood.\n\nSome of the minigames to recruit citizens require you to be very fast and accurate with button pushing, the only game I could not complete was the soda guzzling one and had to get the photon to slow time to be able to complete it.\n\nAnd it's annoying trying to recruit the weather lady as she will only appear and join you during a thunder storm, same sort of problem with the scientist.\n\nDespite things I dislike, I had a lot of fun playing this game, I've played plenty of old school RPG's and pokemon and this game has a simular feel, I like it a lot rate it 7/10.\n\nIt may not be everyone's cup of tea, but it sure is mine.","February 14","true","73.6"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","0"

The basics of the game is pretty fun too..you recruit everyday people and their jobs or how they live determine their skills. At first, their skills might not be that forthcoming in usefulness, but once you level them a bit, their skills turn out to be an asset. Some people are very hard to recruit, as i have had personal issues trying to recruit the weather woman, and finding her when it was raining. The dungeons are quite fun too in this game. This game does not take itself seriously though, and tends to break the 4th wall between the player and the game characters.

This game does some things perfectly and other things not so much. The voice acting is perfect, the writing is very funny, the music is great, there are a ton of different abilites you can expiriment with, and each citizen has a unique talent you can use out of combat. ( For example the musician will let you change the music to any music within the game at any time ) The way you go about collecting citizens is done very well and there are a bunch of neat side missions in the game too. However, the combat is kinda bland at times, especially later in the game, and its very hard to avoid enemys when you don't want to fight. They can see you from very far and will chase you down. This is probably the thing I hated most about this game. Luckily, after you beat an area the enemies run away from you when you walk by. The level design in this game isn't that great either, its usually some mazelike area littered with the same three enemies. You end up just constantly battling enemies until you find the right direction. Even so, I liked it probably way more than I should have. I'd recommend it if you like funny games or if you are looking for an rpg along the lines of pokemon, where the combat isn't to complicated and there's collecting to be had.","March 3","true","25.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Never played Earthbound, so I cannot deploy the comparison everyone else is, but enjoyed my time with the game regardless.\n\nCombat seems simple at first, but the battle system becomes a little more complex as the game progresses and party members are added (never getting too complicated or difficult, though).\n\nCharacters are rather bland, never moving beyond the initial stereotyping of their names, but that may be by design.  With 40 party members to recruit and use, though, the game encourages you to try new things and experiment with different party combinations, which helps keep things fresh.\n\nFound the story rather bland as well, nothing beyond your typical "mysterious-evil-slowly-destroying-the-land" with a couple curveballs thrown in.  The setting was a nice change of pace from the typical RPG locales, given a bit of a modern, American flair to JRPGs.  Dialogue, however, is sharp, with excellent voice acting on a 15 dollar indie rpg.  The little easter egg jokes you find by exploring the world are good for a chuckle or two, as well.\n\nReplay-wise, they do offer an option for a New Game + when finished, though I didn't feel compelled enough to run it a second time.  All of the achievements can be unlocked in one playthrough as well, defeating the completionist's need to run through it again.  However, you may find it enjoyable enough to revisit it at a later date.\n\nPerformance-wise, runs relatively smoothly, with a couple hiccups coming in larger areas late in the game, mostly when opening the map/menu.  Apart from that, the game does feature some nasty bugs which will often crash your game for you, but the solid Autosave system should prevent any serious data loss when it hits you.  And it will hit you. (Note, Devs are inquiring about bugs/glitches on the discussion boards, so they seem like they intend on fixing their game up at least. Bonus points, as always).\n\nOverall I'd give it a 7/10.  For 14.99 you get a light-hearted JRPG romp with about 30 hours of gameplay.  Definitely worth a glance if you're already a fan of the genre, but not exciting/different enough to win over anyone that doesn't like JRPG's to begin with.","February 4, 2015","true","40.7"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","1"

The final boss though, is absolutely incredible, there is next to no buildup or clues to the villain, who it is, is incredibly obvious, and satisfying to defeat, and the actual final boss beyond that, cements the game's status as a Spirtual Successor to Earthbound. It shouldn't be treated as such while playing through, as to prevent Nostalgia Blindness, but should be recognised as such after completing the game to ensure how amazing the game is\n\nIt's only Feburary as of this review being written, and I already consider this game as my GOTY 2015","February 16, 2015","true","18.9"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","1"

It is a classic JRPG with a lot of personality, charm, and humor. The game takes place in and around a city and features a good variety of locations and enemies.\n\nGameplay Premise/Loop:\n- The game is divided into 7 Chapters. Each chapter has objectives that need to be met to proceed.\n- You play as the Vice President's brother and go around the town fighting enemies and meeting other citizens that you can recruit into your party. Each of these have their own attacks and moves along with a special ability. Leveling up someone eventually gets them to better levels of their ability. For example, you can recruit a pilot to fast travel around the world. Leveling her up will allow her to take you to more places.\n\nPros:\n- As I said before, the game has a lot of charm. Great art style, great sense of humor, characters all feel different.\n- Ability to name characetrs whatever you want.\n- Not all that difficult. Also one character allows you to make the game harder or easier.\n- Fun world to explore.\n\nCons:\n- No world map. There is a map for the area you are in, but no world map. This leads to the game beign harder to navigate than it should be. I ended up having to search google for a world map to reference.\n- Objectives are sometimes a little too ambiguous.  I wish the game just told me where i needed to go.\n- Some characters are required to proceed and this isnt always clear.\n- I wish the game would tell me where to find characters again after i met them the first time. Example: I needed to find the gym to recruit the bodybuilder, but i couldnt remember what building was the gym. They are not clearly labeled.\n\nAll in all, if you like JRPGS, i think you would enjoy this. It isnt nearly as long as most jrpgs and it is a fun game to play in the middle of other stuff.","December 18, 2015","true","20.5"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

This is a quality game. In the JRPG style (menu-based combat), you play as the Vice President of Earth, your typical blowhard politician. But you don't fight as him but as three of 30 or so characters that you collect through a variety of side quests. Each of the characters has different strengths and weaknesses, like elemental resistance, healing, powerful attacks or weaker attacks that hit multiple enemies. Also, each character has a "talent", which ranges from super handy (like transporting from one location to another, offering powerups, zooming out in the map and speeding/slowing down time) to the useless (changing the music, the weather, etc.) All of the different characters allow you to play to your own playstyle. Want to wallop your enemies? Do it! Want to play it safe with an on-hand healer? You can! There are characters who help you level faster, who restore your energy, and many who do wacky things that have big payouts later at severe detriments now.\n\nThe story is silly and full of references to typical JRPG mechanics, Dungeons & Dragons, video games in general, pop culture. The baddies are equally silly, with mutant animals like a Catctus (a cat-shaped cactus) and the Decaffinator (a robot espresso machine). It never takes itself too seriously.\n\nDon't be deceived by the cutesy style. This is a well--crafted game. I spent nearly 40 hours trying to unlock all the characters, do all the sidequests, and unlock all the achievements.  IT's a super slick design, great interface. The map is huge with tons of secret areas and collectibles.\n\nCons (very few and minor): There are certain tasks that can only be completed with certain characters (mainly unlocking other characters). And some of the character unlocking tasks are vague in what you need to do and require either great thought or an online cheat and are not obvious at all. (Es: For the scientist character, you have to just hang around until there's a thunderstorm, which you have no control over). Also, the world is SPRAWLING and there is no actual map that you can access, even to get a vague idea of where you are or where you need to go. There is a character that allows you to zoom out, but it doesn't go nearly as far out as the entire world. Some of the areas are not entirely obvious that you can enter (their ramps to higher/lower areas are often seemingly invisible). Thus, I spent a LONG time in certain areas going in circles, trying to access an area with a non-obvious entrance. You can go down into some of the oceans, too, which took me a LONG time to figure out. However, most of the game is clearly telegraphed with graphics or dialogue as to what you should be doing or going, though not always.\n\nOverall: Great game, especially if you like silliness and menu-based combat. Don't be fooled by its cutesy look. This is a quality game.","December 29, 2015","true","38.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game does not try to make itself relatable and just goes full blown 'out there' from the start, although im aware earthbound was silly too, this game main character try harder to work with whats around, rather than be driven by the story. The only relatable thing in the game is the "world" leaders being incompetent and other nonsense you'll come across lol. The game feature a lot of content, often clearing a sidequest will cause you to come across another and oftentimes the reward wont be disapointing, depending on which characters you are using.\n\nSpeaking of characters, there is a lot, the game replace developing 2-3 characters who wont usualy get much development at all.. by gathering a LOT of them, and everyone of them has a special skills that can be used out of combat usualy, a bit like pokemon. Some will let you access new areas while another one can downright change the game difficulty on the spot. Most characters are different enough so that using them and trying them all out is rewarding, but some seem clearly better suited for a long chipping fight vs bursting down easy targets. You can actually re-start any battle with different citizens midfight if you are having trouble. Each citizens bring its own stats boost upon level up as well so building a team becomes an interesting challenge after a while, a bit like leveling different class for stats in tactic ogre on ps1.\n\nThe game is not too short and since you can turn the difficulty and the presense of a new game plus.. there is a lot of replayability down there for the big fans. Combats plays out like a standard turn by turn, but still has a few mechanic twists like the buff/debuff systems and the energy system.\n\nEnjoy!\n\n-Lost","April 2, 2015","true","44.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

You swap these citizens in and out of your party based on the sitatuation before you, such as in Pokémon.\n\nAnd well, that's it. The voice acting is pretty great, the music is bland at times, the writing smart and funny usually, the art is.. not my style, and mechanically the game feels very Flash-y and low budget.\n\nFor the price, I'm going to go ahead and recommend this. However there are more polished and engaging RPGs out there for this price such as Child of Light, Transistor, and Costume Quest 2. I would go check those out first.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gunsage/recommended/258910/","gunsage","gunsage","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gunsage/","772 products in account","So here are my thoughts on Citizens of Earth so far. Destructoid was right, but I don't agree with their final score. You level up fairly quickly and with the exception of certain optional boss fights, the game never really feels like it throws you any major challenges unless you increase the difficulty.  However, I chalk this up to wanting to target a more casual audience, so that's not necessarily a bad thing\n\nIt also means you can fly through the game quickly if you want to or increase the difficulty for a tougher, more oldschool challenge. There really doesn't seem to be much of a penalty for death either.  They don't allow people outside the party to level up unless you enroll them in school, which costs money. Still an interesting option as I don't really use the money for much of anything else so far (you get a fairly steady amount of items through battle alone).\n\nHowever, this goes back to does a game have to be hard in order to be fun? No. No it doesn't. CoE is funny, cheesy, and silly all in one. There are a lot of groanable one liners, but ultimately it hits the mark in terms of weird and comedic values.  At the end of the day, if you liked Earthbound, you will like this title. Just don't expect it to actually BE Earthbound.","January 24, 2015","true","9.5"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","1"

The fact is for many games that are similar to this, the optimal control scheme is to use the arrow keys for the movement and the Z and X for your cancel and confirm respectively. Here the controls are set up for arrows and movement along with WASD, and for your cancel and confirm it is the J and K keys respectively.

The game has crashed out on me countless times already.\n\nMost recently was when I was trying to exploit the VR arena to power level a bit. There are some monsters in the game that don't actually attack and will summon an add every round and...that's it. So I summoned a full part of just those monsters and spammed aoe. In one battle I was able to get around 400 xp (at 2x xp) with minimal effort. That wasn't the problem exactly though--exploits like these are in genre and perfectly nostalgic.\n\nThe problem was when the game summoned a monster a bit farther to the left than the game typically allows after I had killed a few of the adds. When I put in through my attacks, the game closed itself out.\n\nThis was hardly the first time either. The game seemingly closed itself on multiple times with no readily apparent reason. There was a recent patch but this latest crash happened after it. The other crashes--I don't know if they've been fixed. Or what's been fixed. The update doesn't really say what it did.\n\nCombat isn't easy or anything but it is kind of...dull. Your good abilities require energy and it is balanced, of course, but the damage you do with your generators is often laughable and with a game as many encounters as there are here--whether just to level up or simply because you can't avoid them--it can be a bit rough. The real problem is that you can't speed through some combat messages. The 'item get' screen after beating an enemy is particularly egregious, not letting you click past it for several seconds which feel a lot longer.\n\nThe humor at the expense of politicians gets some chuckles but is it really Earthbound humor? The big thing about Earthbound was that it was actually kind of dark at times and more importantly had a lot of heart, heart you could see right at the start. While I haven't reached the end of the game by this time in the review, I don't really feel like it has the kind of heart that made Earthbound so wonderful and that's a big problem when you're claiming it as an inspiration even if it's not meant to be a ripoff.\n\nThat being said, a game willing to try some neat mechanics or unusual story--which, okay, I don't know of many rpgs that have me as the vice president--are worth checking out on its own merits  and I certainly feel like an rpg fan could do a lot worse--particularly if they fix the crashes and bugs.\n\n(kinda ironic that a bug spawning seems to have been cause for my recnet crash).\n\nOh, and uh--when I load up the game, the options scream on pc before getting in is just kinda ugly you know?","January 23, 2015","true","9.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

After playing the "tweak RadeonPro/try different resolutions" game, I finally brought the game up to a playable level. Initially I had issues with crashes, lag and menus not showing. However, I was never able to get rid of the lines that you can see in the character models, battle backgrounds and occasionally on the world screen walking around. The reason I put up with it is because this game is awesome and it kind of reminds me of the grid lines in the battles in Phantasy Star II.\n\nI love Citizens of Earth and can highly recommend it for $14.99 (even though I got it on summer sale at $7.99.) The Mother/Earthbound comparisons are going to be inevitable in every review. It has the same kind of dream logic meets modern-day satire RPG feel that all the Mother games had. There is a reference on a police computer (APB for a spiteful boy with a cracked bat, I believe) and is referential in general gameplay. It may have even more of an open world than Earthbound. After the initial chapters, you can pretty much go where you want in any direction. It also has multiple traveling methods from helicopter to even sleep-walking.\n\nThis sandbox of fun is what makes it stand above all other "indie RPG" or RPG-maker games. There's a level of detail to the gameplay that is unmatched by its peers. The game has a lot of ground to cover, and many things to do on the way. Every one of the 40 recruitable characters has a Talent. This could be ordering stuff from Fed-Ups and having it delivered to you after a certain amount of time. Different items take longer or shorter time to deliver. Or maybe you want to do some inventive farming and craft items. You can move blockage from your path with the Bodybuilder (feel free to call him Manwich like I did.)  The Programmer can enter the internet matrix to fight viruses, and while you're at a computer, you can arrange and fight VR battles to grind levels for your party. You can also travel between computers with the matrix.\n\nAnd you will be grinding. You can use the school function to have your characters gain levels while outside the battle party, but what fun is that? Also, they don't get the additional stat boosts characters can get depending on who they fight with in the battle party! I didn't mind grinding at all, I always had fun getting a new low-level character and grinding him up with some powerful guys doing most of the heavy lifting. The individuality in the recruits is amazing, every one has a widely varied set of moves and play styles. Some characters go together like peanut butter and jelly, like the Barista with her high levels of energy, and the Musician who can steal it from her and use the energy for multiple-turn blasts of either healing or enemy party damage. I imagine the minds at Eden Industries pored over the battles system and character sheets for a long time, making sure each ability mattered and each character felt unique.\n\nThe humor is satirical, and aimed at the politically correct sometimes, at the vapid candidates that run for office other times. Kicking the ♥♥♥♥ out of protesters is fun. A scarecrow comprised of several crows is delightful. I felt no remorse murdering child campers in the woods of Camp Koo Koo. They were full of sugar and coming right at me! I had to fight back! It turns out a corporate robot candy executive was responsible for that anyway, so my hands are clean.\n\nIf you are like me and find modern RPGs way too easy, this has an option to change the difficulty via the School Mascot's Talent. I wish the game would save these changes but it resets when you load a save file. I suggest cranking it to 1.40 for most of the game, and then up to 2.00 occasionally for the 2x Talent XP. Be warned though, it can be tough at 2.00, but it doesn't matter anyway because as far as I can tell there's no penalty for dying. If you are back in a starting area you can put it beyond 2.00 to make the enemies a decent challenge. Why anyone would LOWER the game's difficulty is beyond my comprehension, but you can if you want to.\n\nThis not an Earthbound clone.

But get that out of your head, it's a completely different game.  In this game you recruit various professionals, blue collar workers, and public servants to fight evil.  You can control 3 people at a time and can recruit about 40 different people.  About half of the game is just completing missions to recruit people.  The main story line is actually quite short, but given how many side quests are in this game, you won't care.","August 29, 2015","true","34.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/excellentist/recommended/258910/","excellentist","FantasticPancake","http://steamcommunity.com/id/excellentist/","363 products in account","If you're at all a fan of traditional turn-based (J)RPGs, this game is a treat. You explore a large world, completing various sidequests to recruit a wide array of NPCs as permanent party members.\n\nThe humor is there, but it's not enough to carry the game on its own. This is a game that you should only play if the mechanics interest you. The story is virtually nonexistent.\n\nThe turn-based mechanics are top-notch. Rather than shooting spells out of a massive pool of MP, your characters all have a small energy stat, with 5 or less points (average is 2-3). Weak attacks raise your energy, and strong ones spend it. This gives the developers a lot of room to make each character different. A chef will use powerful fire attacks, but lack useful weak moves. Combo him with a barrista who can charge up your other members' energy, and you've got synergy.\n\nThe mechanics dare you to find powerful synergies between the abilities of the massive cast of recruitable characters, posing an engaging challenge to a keen RPG buff. The energy system keeps you from becoming complacent in random battles, where you still have to pay attention to what you're doing. With the most strategic turn-based RPG system I've seen (and I'm a huge fan of the SMT series), I'd recommend this for any fan of these games.","November 8, 2015","true","10.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

(There's a part where I was pepper spraying sugar crazed campers with my Cop while a sentient toaster was strangling my Conspiricy Guy with it's electrical cord.)\n\nAlmost all the dialog is fully voice acted, too, which is pretty nice, although it does get a bit tiring in combat to hear the same 5 or 6 lines over and over every turn.\n\nOne of the most jarring problems I've noticed, is that it has a few features that act on a real-time timer, which kind of gives it an idle game feel, but they're not even major parts of the game that I've noticed, so it's a minor complaint at best.\n\nAnother thing is that I have a feeling the game is going to be short, while only playing 6 hours as of writing this, I've recruited 1/4 of the Citizens and have over half of the steam acheivements, so it is kind of sad.\n\nA lot of interesting ideas and an awesome overall look, I'd reccomend this game if you're a big fan of Earthbound or are just looking for a different RPG from your normal hack n' slash fantasy romp.\n\nIt's not the perfect game for me but I really think it's close to the mark! 9/10","January 24, 2015","true","8.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This is annoying but fortunately the\nautosave function occurs when you zone so it hasn't been a huge issue\n\n3) Combat gets repetitive, and there are WAY too many mobs put on the field.  I like that you can choose to enter battle by avoiding creatures but in some places they're packed so densely that you have to go through a LOT of battles to move forward a small amount\n\n4) The menu screen UI is pretty shoddy, requires a TON of moving the cursor to get things done in talents/items/etc\n\nI'm enjoying the game and I would have recommended, but being apparently stuck on the story quest due to a bug (or an insanely low drop rate effectively making this ridiculous) pretty much ruined it for me.\n\nEdit:  I seem to have bypassed the bug and managed to continue with the story.  The bug prevented me from obtaining the Barista companion and I can no longer get the special brew.  No longer game breaking, just frustrating.\n\nEdit 2: Thanks dev - I actually read online that it was supposed to sell it to you but that never happened, and when I killed my first decaffinator I randomly got the secret brew immediately after that battle (and the same thing happened in the youtube vid I saw) so I assumed that was a typo.

You explore a large world, completing various sidequests to recruit a wide array of NPCs as permanent party members.\n\nThe humor is there, but it's not enough to carry the game on its own. This is a game that you should only play if the mechanics interest you. The story is virtually nonexistent.\n\nThe turn-based mechanics are top-notch. Rather than shooting spells out of a massive pool of MP, your characters all have a small energy stat, with 5 or less points (average is 2-3). Weak attacks raise your energy, and strong ones spend it. This gives the developers a lot of room to make each character different. A chef will use powerful fire attacks, but lack useful weak moves. Combo him with a barrista who can charge up your other members' energy, and you've got synergy.\n\nThe mechanics dare you to find powerful synergies between the abilities of the massive cast of recruitable characters, posing an engaging challenge to a keen RPG buff. The energy system keeps you from becoming complacent in random battles, where you still have to pay attention to what you're doing. With the most strategic turn-based RPG system I've seen (and I'm a huge fan of the SMT series), I'd recommend this for any fan of these games.","November 8, 2015","true","10.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It just has too many small flaws that add up to an overall unenjoyable and frustrating experience.\n\nCombat itself can be interesting, however there are a number of things holding it back. Firstly and my major complaint is that death animations and the Vice President banter eat up a lot of time away from the player, you end up having to wait anywhere from 2-5 seconds for each of these things to play out. An example: You kill 4 bees with an AoE attack, each of them has to play an individual death animation each taking up a minimum of 2 seconds, so for the group you end up losing 8 seconds where you can't do anything, you can't skip it, or speed it up in any way. With multi-enemy battles being a fairly common occurance you'll be waiting a lot. The vice president can also randomly decides to say one of his voice lines, which causes loss of character control and again no way to skip or speed it up mid battle. So you end up spending a LOT of time just waiting for things to finish rather than actually playing the game. And combat is something you're CONSTANTLY doing in this game, there are SO MANY enemies in this game it is impossible to avoid them all!!!\n\nGrinding is another problem in this game. Be it voluntary or just the sheer number of enemies on any screen at a time you will be grinding or fighting monsters constantly. So you would think that with all this mandatory or forced fighting you would have some customization over your default actions in combat, this is not the case. There is no way to customize how your skills/abilities/actions are placed in the menu, nor is there a means to repeat your last performed action on a character. So you spend a majority of each battle just hunting down your most used skill/ability/action, This gets old very quickly with how often you're in combat.\n\nI was hoping that maybe a patch would come by and fix these flaws. However after taking several months break from the game and giving it another go just now this is not the case. So personally, I would not recommend this game and I would recommend spending your time and money elsewhere.","May 9","false","10.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The gameplay is basically Earthbound with a story involving you as the Vice President of Earth trying to save the planet. It takes about 15 to 20 hours to get through the game, and then you will have to grind for several monotonous hours if you want to get all of the achievements.\n\nSeveral factors that lead me to give this a negative review:\n\n1. The game crashes sometimes (not too often, but even once is annoying in an RPG as it then forces you to save every few minutes out of fear) and there is horrible screen tearing/flickering in some areas of the game. Screen issues can be reduced (but could not be fully alleviated on my machine) by lowering the resolution of the game, but that shouldn't have to be necessary. There are also other random bugs, such as an issue with receiving Group EXP at the end of some fights.\n\n2. After the beginning, the game slows down, forcing lots of walking and unavoidable fights which start to become annoying. In addition, there is no way to skip animations and speed up fights like in other games, which doesn't help. This is especially cumbersome when you are achievement-hunting after beating the game.\n\n3. There is no difficulty with the game; I personally never used an item the entire game and I also never lost a fight. This is amplified through a "feature" associated with one of the characters in the game, which allows you to create virtually invincible characters with minimal work. For reference, after spending about an hour utilizing this method midway through the game, I ended up being able to one-shot the final boss when I reached him. I have no idea why this character was thought to be a necessary addition to the game.\n\n4. I also found personally some of the "stereotypes" that they make fun of to be a bit tasteless. For example, the "Sushi Chef" character that says "at least I died with honor" in an awkward English when he dies in a battle was not my cup of tea, although perhaps that is the humor one must appreciate for this game.\n\nOverall, while I do not think this game is particularly that bad, there are enough negative elements that I am drawn to giving a "No Recommendation", especially at its price. I would recommend acquiring it through a sale or a Humble Bundle if you choose to purchase it.","December 19, 2015","false","27.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This makes the menus impossible to navigate.  The developer thinks it’s caused by Big Picture mode, but the game does this even if you launch it from the desktop mode of Steam. Further, xBox 360 users are reporting the issue too.  The developer says there is probably nothing they can do.\nThe problem is worse because the game won’t let you switch between controller and mouse+kb.  Once the game detects the controller it disables your mouse.\nThe game is crashing in big picture mode.\n","December 5, 2015","false","13.6"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","2"

Since this is Steam I'll leave you with some quick bullet points.\n\nPros:\n\n-Excellent art style.  Obviously inspired by Earthbound but still manages to be it's own thing.\n-Expansive cast of playable characters with varying abilities and play styles that begs experimentation.\n-The voice acting is suitably cheesy.\n-Combat system is solid and well thought out without being overly complicated.\n\nCons:\n\n-Some recruitment minigames are more tedious then challenging.  I particularly hated the Musicians.\n-The humor falls flat more often then it should tarnishing the game's charm.\n-Default difficulty is so far to easy, BUT this can be changed.\n-Some enemies are tedious to fight without offering challenge.\n\nI will probably expand this after I complete the game and see more of the main plot and can gauge the overall length of game which are the two final deciding factors for a real review.  In short however if this game interests you, then I suggest giving the developer some money, you will likely enjoy what you get and the cost is pretty low.

It has some intresting ideas it throws around, but for the most part the game does what is 90% wrong with JRPGS.\n\nI am almost positive the biggest driving force behind ANY of it's sales is that it made an attempt to identify with Earthbound, which to be honest is ridiculous. It lacks the art, humor and soul of Earthbound.\n\nThe game substitutes any sort of meaningful character progression by having 40-ish party members, none of them being interesting, meaningful or deep. All of the character abilities and commands are just re-hases of other ones under different names.\n\nDon't even get me started about the gear and equipment system which is obviously implemented to increase gameplay time, not enchance gameplay.\n\nThe developers should be ashamed. Just terrible. I really wantred to like it, but to be honest the ONLY reason why I wanted to like it was because of the Earthbound name drops. Outside of this, the game isn't special, it isn't unique and honestly it's not good.","January 30, 2015","false","2.5"," 14 of 55 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","14","55","0","0"

Like LISA, "collecting" companions is a key element here. A top-down, polished RPG featuring some great voice acting and a quirky cast of characters.

The soundtrack is adventurous and reminds me of Donkey Kong Country/ Character design and animations make this a better standalone game than some big budget titles. It's easy to see the love put into this game by it's developers and the art team. There are many aspects of this title to admire, but the bottom line is that it deserves to be played.

However, looking at it from a critical standpoint, I have to categorize it as a mixed bag.\n\nThe game really rolls with the concept of you coming off of earthbound or something similar, and it does a fairly decent job at being at it's attempt at being a successor, albeit focusing more on the comedy side than the emotion/nightmare fuel side. There's even a few blatant references and not so blatant references here and there, and the battle system doesn't do a bad job at capturing that feel.\n\nOutside of that, the game's humor is often spot on, and it's pretty fun to walk around recruiting new characters and doing side quests. The characters themselves are really colorful, and have no problem standing out despite the sheer amount of them. The story line really doesn't take itself very seriously, but does enough that you can at least get relatively invested in it.\n\nOn the other hand, the enemy spawn rates can be highly obnoxious, and I often feel ready to tear my hair out after having to trudge through hundreds of repetitive enemies just for one simple goal. There's so much stuff to do half the time I don't even realize what I should be doing, and end up killing a bunch of things for no reason. Though this has gotten better with updates, the game still has a few bugs, the most common one I got being stuck and having to restart.\nThe bosses are also often anticlimactic, since the hordes of enemies usually pose more of a threat.\n\nOverall, it's a game you can get a lot of fun out of-and a game you need quite a lot of patience for.","May 16","true","34.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
