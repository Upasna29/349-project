"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dragnix/recommended/366350/","Dragnix","{FITH}™Dragnix","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dragnix/","743 products in account","Summary:\n\nThis key was obtained via the developer.\n\nI do think that the concept while simple can work, but even with the low cost of admission and a basic but workable concept, the lack of variety shows up rather quickly and hurts the game too much to recommend at this time. Games can be simple and be effective, but the simple nature here is countered by the over reliance on reflex mechanics, and a lack of enemy variety and stage variety means that after 30 minutes, the game will start boring you a bit. Some rules in the game don't make a lot of sense, and you'll have a sense of frustration set in rather quickly. It's hard, but not in the good way in my opinion. Also, quick restart buttons.\n\nGameplay Footage and Video First Impressions: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii2jEi9yu5M\n\nLists:\n\n+:\nSome good pixel art, in particular with the wood creature.\nAt the core, the simple playstyle can be interesting and more of a reflex based game.\n-:\nThe lack of variety is core to the problem here. No variety in enemies and a lack of variety in background/spells to cast makes it so that the game starts to wear on you rather quickly.\nThe reliance on reflex mechanics is too high, as there's barely any room to fail in terms of the high speed of projectiles. While some will consider this a strength, with the randomization of enemy placement, this can lead to no win scenarios.\nThe powers variety in particular is a problem, there's other mechanics that could have been chosen that really could have been interesting, but there's repetition here.\nSome unnecessary rules leads to a lack of user mechanics, which is a shame because it really was unnecessary.\nWhile there is controller support, the necessity of the keyboard/mouse becomes apparent with having to go through menus with the keyboard, for example.","June 30, 2015","false","3.3"," 20 of 25 people (80%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","80","20","25","5","1"

This was annoying.\n\nBeside it the game is pretty simple and there is no depth to it...In literally 30 minutes You can see everything the game has to offer. This should cost less than 1 euro.","January 1","false","1.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The first 1.5 hours I spent getting it to work properly but thanks to a nice friendly dev I was being a wizard in no time.\n\nI loved the intro and I loved the story and the jokes they put in but after like 20 minutes that just stops and it becomes a rather dull endless runner kind of game with very little variations.\n\nI would still recommend it though, as I hope that more stuff will be added such as more story, more enemies and most of all, more locations to run! I think that would make this game actually great. In it's current form it is not as awesome as I feel it could be.\n\n6/10 I would say.\n","July 1, 2015","true","3.5"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

If screen could be set to higher so you could see more from the map, could have at least 0,2sec to push the button not 0,05sec:-(\n\nyou need very-very fast reaction to multiple things in this game, some could call it challenging, it was annoying for me, perhaps if there would be different difficulties, where shoots a bit slower etc, i could enjoy it, not as it is right now.\n\nso if you like me and you dont like these things i dont recommend the game for you.","December 5, 2015","false","1.7"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

However, I did think the little story at the beginning was well done. The main part of the game consists of a simple platforming combat, slashing and jumping monsters with little variety in gameplay. Still it's playable for a while at least and you've got some good spells to choose from. Nothing special but not a bad little game. Pick it up in a bundle or on sale.","December 12, 2015","true","2.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Endless running mechanisms now work as intended, Jump, slash and shield yourself to survive threats as long as possible with periodic spells to alter the main design. Not a strong recommendation in any sense, but the idea is nice.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3AN4qXmupw","June 30, 2015","true","1.9"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","2","6","0","4"

The concept is fun and it is pretty challenging to manage all the spells, jumping over obstacles, protecting yourself, and aiming/timing your attacks constantly. But I think the dev(s) could really have added a lot more spells than the current selection. With only six spells, you will quickly find you've experienced all that this game has to offer.","October 24, 2015","true","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
