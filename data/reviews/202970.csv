Yes!\n\nThe Singleplayer\nSo once again you play as an unstoppable killing machine. What makes this campaign stand out, however, is the fact that your actions and choices actually change the outcome of the game.\nThere are about 4 different endings. Each triggered by the choices/actions you make and or take.\nThere's also some little consequences that just scar some of your "teammates".\n\nHaving different endings in a FPS is a very rare thing. Let alone the fact that the ending depends on the actions you take.\nIn Deus Ex: Human Revolution your actions didn't matter at all. In the end you just chose between four different endings.\nThis is not the case in here. In here the ending depends on what you did on the road...making this story more dynamic and even beats some of the RPGs when it comes to affecting the world/story you're in. - Looking at you Mass Effect 3 and Skyrim - No matter what you do in these games, it doesn't matter. Yes, both are good games but you have no effect on the world or the story...yet they call themselves RPGs.\n\nCall of Duty: Black Ops II created a good and dynamic campaign that should set a new par to all FPSs but unfortunatelly this little but important aspect of the game is overlooked just because "hurpdurr it's another CoD"...so what ? This CoD tried! Tried and succeeded!\n\nThe gameplay itself is your old-known CoD gameplay and we're glad that it's back! Admit it! If CoD would change their gameplay then there would be a lot of angry people out there.\nWould you like CS to change the gameplay ? NO! People got angry at DICE when they made character movement more smooth in Battlefield...there's no pleasing people.\nThe character movement is, however, a bit smoother than in the previous CoDs and that makes the game a bit more enjoyable. Especially in the multiplayer.\n\nThe Multiplayer\nI put around 150-160 hours into the multiplayer and I still have nothing to say about it...it's good.\nSo far i've only enjoyed 3 CoD multiplayers: CoD4, MW2 and Blops2.\nSo Blops 2 is in my top 3 Call of Duty games. - This is saying a lot! CoD4 and MW2 are considered the best CoD games even by the hardcore CoD haters!\nThe multiplayer in Blops2 is well balanced, gives you a lot of freedom (in class creation), makes it easier to record gameplay footages and is just simple fun.\nThe only issue i have, with the multiplayer, is that it uses matchmaking instead of having a simple server list.\nIt's still a very good multiplayer experience and i would recommend it to all kinds of FPS fans!\n\n\nThe game is definitely worth the full price. Only good CoD game on the market that's worth the full price!\n+Different choices and endings add replay value to the 8-12h campaign making it a 16-48h campaign.\n+Fun and balanced multiplayer that for the first time really lets you play the way YOU prefer.\n+Co-op zombie modes\n-No server list\n\nYou don't need to own any DLCs to fully enjoy this title","November 3, 2014","true","13.2"," 501 of 636 people (79%) found this review helpful 44 people found this review funny","79","501","636","44","67"

The main reason I got this is because I always loved killing people and getting those radical killstreaks. Not for the campaign, but for the multiplayer. If you are here for the campaign, leave, campaign is about 6 hours long, and there is a lot better games for that, like Far Cry 4, got lots of hours in that for singleplayer only game time. If you are here for multiplayer, then get your wallet ready!\n\nSome FAQ:\n\nQ: Do people still play?\nA: Yes, at certain times and places. Where I am i can get a game quick from 10am to 10pm (West Coast, USA)\n\nQ: Is it worth full price? ($60)\nA: No, I did not get it for full price, why should you. Buy on sale or through trading. (Key Trading bots/people)\n\nQ: Should I use my controler?\nA: No, you will cry cause you get 0 kills.\n\nQ: Can I read?\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: Are you just making up questions to make this review longer?\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: Why?\nA: Why not? Plus I can't think of them, so ask away!\n\nReview for each part of the game:\n\nCampaign-\nNo, get other games, its fun but to short.\n\nMultiplayer-\n\nBetter then most other CoDs. MW2 I own, to many hackers. MW2 being a good CoD.\nThis game is one of the best and still has a strong community of people that make it hacker less.\nI also own AW, its bad, and now 0 people are play, #2MuchDLC.\nWorth the buy if it was just for this.\n\nZombies-\nIts another fun game, fun by youself and with others!\nDifferent from most zombie games.\n\nOther Pros/Cons\n\nPros-\n-You get 3 games in your Library\n-You only have to download the part of the game you want to play, so less space used!\n-Not many hackers! Always a good thing\n\n\nCons-\n-So much paid DLC; a Gun thats super amazinly good, maps that I would like to play, skins. What is this CS:GO? Paying for skins is so CoD, oh wait.\n-Less 8 year olds, I like to talk to them, there fun to mess around with\n-Sadly no price drop, unlike MW2 and such old games.\n\nSo overall well worth the money for the Multiplayer/Zombies!\n\nOriginal that made me famous:\nStill better then Call of Duty: Ghost\nCall of Duty: Advanced Warfare and\nCall of Duty: Black Ops 3 combined!\n\nomg is joke xd","September 17, 2015","true","0.6"," 347 of 463 people (75%) found this review helpful 177 people found this review funny","75","347","463","177","25"

The campaign has a great story with 6 endings. I love the choices you get to make. The multiplayer is more balanced than previously. You actually see all kind of weapons used, and not just that one overpowered weapon everybody uses. The zombie mode is also really fun, especially with friends. If oyu haven't played any CoD for some reason and you don't feel like getting an old CoD I recommend you buy this one, and not Modern Warfare 1/2/3. Also, if you're enjoying the Modern Warfare games you could also check it out. It really is an improvement. But as I said, still generic, don't expect too much to change.

Black Ops II is one of my highest rated single player titles in the franchise. The sheer amount of decisions and choices the game allows YOU to make, drastically effect the game world and story. There are I believe 4 different endings in addition to a number of things that can change. I myself recieved the decent but depressing ending. That being said, if you enjoy a game giving you a thrill ride, a good narrative and some solid gameplay choices Black Ops II delivers on all fronts.

Call Of Duty is an FPS which demands the use of your ears, eyes and mind. You must break situations down and make the correct judgements to execute effective movements. The game allows new people to have killing potential even when more experienced players are in the same lobby. This may be irritating to most but I feel like it gives a more equal tone to even the newest of players.\n\nGameplay:\n\nVery rarely do you ever experience a lagging lobby unless your ping is 120+. Diamond Camo definitely adds an attractive challenge to the game if you wish to add some style and show off your skills to your opponents/team. Hitboxes are perfect. If you hit them you definitely hit them. I feel like most people think they miss because of the hitboxes, it is simply because the slight weapon sway which may be unnoticeable (this causes the bullet to go into a different direction than they expect). Overall, I feel like nothing in this game is completely outrageous; everything makes sense.\n\nRecommendations:\n\nSniper Rifles - Ballista/DSR\n\nAssault Rifles - AN-94/FAL-OSW/SCAR-H\n\nSub Machine Guns - MSMC/MP7/Peacekeeper (Revolution DLC weapon).\n\nPistols - Five-Seven/Tac-45\n\nShotguns - R870/KSG\n\nLight Machine Guns - LSAT\n\nSpecials - Crossbow/Shield\n\nLaunchers - RPG/FHJ-18 AA\n\nLethal Grenades - Semtex/C4\n\nTactical Grenades - EMP/Concussion\n\nAttachments - Adjustable Stock/FastMag/Long Barrel/Foregrip/Reflex Sight  (Fast Mag is recommended most for Snipers due to the disadvantage to SMG users and Assault Rifles).\n\nBugs:\n\nBug exploitation is definitely a thing. The reload-cancel for the shotgun gives a crazy level of unfair advantage but this is not a part of the game that was intentional, nor was the scroll-wheel pistol spray. These aspects are not often used but scripts for the shotgun and scripts for semi-automatic weapons definitely make things difficult. These aren't things which should be patched but they are definitely exploits to be aware of. I will remind you again that very few people use these.\n\nOverall:\n\nPeople often ask me why I don't play games such as Battlefield or Counterstrike, the answer is simple.\nCall of Duty is the fast FPS. Each game has been developed with a new idea. I have played each game and the only thing that is "similar" is the fact that it is a fast FPS.\n\nWhen people complain about how similar each game is, they also manage to complain when the game changes the play-style and movement. You're basically fighting pointless battle when debating with them. Each game managed to bring new models to both people and weapons. They bring new maps, and often change the physical aspect of these maps too (in terms of graphical type, like comparing MW to BO because these games are part different stories, they look different). This game is not incredibly demanding in terms of graphics and I can easily reach 200fps with my AMD Radeon HD 7850 on Maximum settings.\n\n\nThis game is excellent if you like fast FPS gameplay and the opportunity to use your own style of movement against people.\n\n\nGood job, Treyarch!","August 27, 2015","true","0.2"," 115 of 165 people (70%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","70","115","165","19","39"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/202970/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","You had me there for a minute, Call of Duty: Black Ops 2. I thought you made the complete near-future leap, and thanks to a surprisingly subdued and touching opening cutscene, I even believed you would take the Michael Bay film of video games in a mature, less-is-more direction. Then, for a sizable chunk of the campaign, you dropped me into the 1970s and '80s - a jaunt that included first-person punching Manuel Noriega in his pock-marked face. As gratifying as that was, the cross-decade narrative is disappointing and distracting. While those past portions of the campaign feel like retreading old ground, those that are set in 2025 are the best Call of Duty levels since 2007's Modern Warfare. Why couldn't we have a full game of that?\n\nAt the outset (the year 2025), I was tasked with finding out what Raul Menendez, a populist who presents himself as the savior of the world's poor, is up to. He's deftly set up as a villain with a believable motive, and the US government knows he's planning something. Just one problem: I already knew exactly what that mysterious something was because Activision told us all. I even yelled it at the screen a few times in annoyance: "He's planning to take over the US drone fleet, you idiots! Didn't you see the commercials?".\n\nThere may not be any surprises left, but at least it looks good. We're not talking about Battlefield 3-level graphics here, but when it's cranked up to the highest settings Black Ops 2 is head and shoulders above anything Call of Duty has done before. Character models, particularly their faces, look terrific. Light, shadow, and water effects are also strong, but when those stellar characters stand next to certain walls or trees, they highlight how low-definition many of the environmental textures are.\n\nThat could have something to do with the fact that the campaign maps are bigger than what I've come to expect from CoD. Just about every one of the 16 missions is set on a relatively open map with various paths, spots to take cover and flank, and pieces of equipment to use to help fend off the enemy. The early Celerium mission, set first in the jungles of Myanmar before descending into a high-tech underground facility, is particularly impressive, with its seamless blend of exterior and interior environments. After years of scripted, linear shooting, it's refreshing and far more interesting than anything we've seen churned out of the CoD factory in years.\n\nThose wider maps are especially fun when Treyarch hands over the keys to future gadgets like the lumbering, Gatling gun- and flamethrower-packing CLAW walker or the swarming, bullet-spewing quadcopter drones. These tools typically aren't the scripted, "get on that machine gun!" moments CoD is famous for, rather, they're wisely integrated elements we can use when and how we decide. The futuristic guns aren't all that remarkable, but some of their sci-fi attachments have a wonderful transforming effect, like the seemingly basic laser dot scope that doubles as an X-ray vision device to spot enemies through walls.\n\nOf course, while these missions are more open than prior CoD maps, it's no Far Cry style open world - they still have artificial limits that rear their ugly heads at the most inopportune times. For example, in a mission where I put the very cool Wing Suit to work by jumping off of a mountain and flying toward my target, I tried to do a bit of exploring and banked to the right. Almost immediately the screen went grey, and I was awarded with instant death for straying "too far from the flight path." On another level set inside a massive resort, I tried to flank the enemy by pushing out to a section of the map I could see on the left. All that stood in my path was a velvet rope, but it might as well have been the Great Wall of China because I wasn't getting past it.\n\nAnother nice touch of limited freedom is a pre-mission menu that allows customization of your loadout, multiplayer style, in the campaign. Weapon, accessory, equipment, and perk options are all there, giving us real options in how we want to approach each mission. Will I let my squad push forward while I sit back and snipe, or will I surge forward and flank with a submachine gun? It's terrific to actually have the choice of tactics.\n\nThe biggest problem with the campaign is that, even forgiving the spoilers, all the interesting, fun-to-play stuff is in the near-future setting. The story veers back to the past too often to set up an unnecessary and convoluted human drama that connects protagonist David Mason, his father Alex Mason and buddy Frank Woods from the first Black Ops, and the villain Menendez. I sighed every time I had to flash back to Angola in the 1970s or Panama and Afghanistan in the 1980s to plod through this truly silly tale without all of my cool near-future tools and gear.\n\nAs for the multiplayer : farewell, Kill Streak system. Back when you were young and innovative you helped elevate Call of Duty to juggernaut status, but it's high time you received an upgrade. Surprisingly, it turns out that all that Black Ops 2 needed to make CoD multiplayer feel fresh and reinvigorated, if not reinvented and free of frustration, was a seemingly minor tweak. Meet the Score Streak system, a new well-balanced reward system that makes me feel like an action hero for helping my teammates rather than exclusively celebrating brute-force killing power. Combined with a much more flexible character customization system, Score Streaks help this year's multiplayer feel like more than just another rehash.\n\nAs the name indicates, you no longer unlock support actions like UAVs or air strikes with three-, five-, and seven-kill streaks. Now, those rewards are earned by scoring points via kills, assists, capturing an objective, successfully defending an objective, and more. For objective-based gamers like me who prefer to help others rather than go for lone-wolf sprees, the shift is absolutely noticeable and a terrific boost.\n\nI also like how Treyarch has tweaked multiplayer loadouts with the new Pick 10 system. As the name indicates, you can outfit your character with a grand total of 10 items, including primary and secondary weapons, accessories, perks, grenades, and equipment. That's further mixed up with the use of Wild Cards, which allow you to hyper-specialize. As you can imagine, the 10-item limit means making tough choices, but it also leads to some unique combinations and some truly custom characters like my Primary Gunfighter Wild Card build.\n\nThat card opens up a third accessory slot for my primary weapon and enables me to have a sight, FMJ bullets, and a quickdraw handle on my assault rifle. The drawback is that I'm taking up five of my Pick 10 slots with my primary weapon alone (including its three accessories and the Primary Gunfighter Wild Card), so I've given up any accessories on my secondary weapon, a perk, and a tactical grenade. This kind of freedom to give and take is a more than welcome addition.\n\nWhile these are all fairly significant changes that're pleasingly out of character for an annualized franchise famous for producing steadily degrading copies of Modern Warfare (which is still the best of the series), make no mistake: this is still Call of Duty. It looks and feels like the shooter Infinity Ward created years ago. Black Ops 2 is also the most concerted effort yet to convince players to grow their wolf packs through some good old-fashioned team play, and in many ways it succeeds. It not only gives Call of Duty multiplayer fans their annual dose, but actually makes it better.","October 25, 2015","true","290.6"," 50 of 61 people (82%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","82","50","61","13","2"

Although short, with less than 20 missions in all, I found it quite good and enjoyable. The price steam has it is NOT worth it at all, try and find a physical copy or buy it on console or something, it's probably better to get it on that costwise.\n\nCampaign Mode:\nI never played BO1 properly, I played it at a friends house on his ps3, and my experience was very biased, as I had never played a CoD game before, they instructed me to die constantly, killing the experience for me. After playing through BO2's campaign, I have found one of my favourite single player experiences. I enjoyed the storyline, and the characters were great. The bonus(?) levels where you took control of multiple troops was one of my favourite experiences, as it reminded me of some of my favourite games. Like I said, the storyline is rather short, but it is very enjoyable.\n\n\nZombies Mode:\n\nAfter playing Zombies for a bit, I found it quite enjoyable. I found myself playing the doom soundtrack in the background. Zombies mode is your run of the mill horde based zombie defence. Unlock new areas inside your map to make life easier or harder. Fun game mode, and in my opinion, its a good game to play when bored or depressed. It's a good time waster, and the slow moving zombies, tied in with the fact they explode when on fire, is quite funny.\n\nAnd Finally, Multiplayer:\n\nMultiplayer has to be one of the most fun online FPS experiences I've had since I first started CS:GO or TF2. I've had the same enjoyment that I've had whilst playing games like Doom 1. It started off a little slow and rocky, with everyone else having great weapons compared to my pleb tier weapons. After I hit level 4, I unlocked custom loadouts, letting me use my personal favourite weapon. The multiple game modes make for a fun experience. The only thing I would prefer is a better sever joining system, such as the ones in valve games. BO2's multiplayer server system is more of a wheel of fortune, roll and hope you get a full game.\n\nAll in all, Black Ops 2 is one of my favourite games to date, and it is definatley worth a buy if you get it on sale","October 11, 2014","true","9.3"," 57 of 75 people (76%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","76","57","75","4","3"

First, lets talk about about performance.\n\nPERFORMANCE\nMy PC is an absolute potato. I have a gtx 260 with around 800MBs of VRAM, and an intel i7 920 running at 2.66GHz. However, i still get 60 fps solid in this game with shadows on low in windowed mode around 1300p. I occasionally get a little bit of a framerate drop every once in a while, but it only lasts for half a second or so and then I jump right up to 60 fps again. This game runs extremely well, considering how good it looks.\n\nPLAYERBASE\nNow, lets get into the playerbase. The community hub is filled with lies and misinformation about the playerbase of this game. Singleplayer, Multiplayer, and Zombies each have DIFFERENT community hubs, which means that when you see "500 players in game" on the black ops 2 hub, it means that there are 500 people playing the SINGLEPLAYER. if you go to the multiplayer hub, this game averages around 2,000 to 4,000 players daily. I live in southestern united states, and I the only time that I ever have a hard time getting a match is in party mix, since it's kinda dead.\n\nZOMBIE PLAYERBASE\nThe zombie playerbase, however, is cancer. It takes me several tries to even get into a single multiplayer match, and half of the time I lag out because I lost connection to the host.\n\nPRICE\nLets talk about price now. the 60 dollar price tag on steam is ridiculously overpriced. DO NOT PAY FULL PRICE FOR THIS GAME. Wait until a steam sale or get it from a legitimate second hand site. This game is definitely worth 20 bucks or so if you're into this style.\n\nGAMEPLAY\nLets talk about the actual game now. The multiplayer is great, and sometimes rage inducing. I play a ton of CS:GO, so it took me a little bit of time to get used to this whole style. But once I did, I got completely hooked. When you start out the game, you get really crappy guns for multiplayer, and unless you're really really good, you probably will get absolutely destroyed until you unlock some new ones. So, if you're getting absolutely rekt in multiplayer, just hang in there a little bit until you get some new guns. Then decide whether you like it.\n\nCOMMUNITY The community is kind of cancerous, I won't lie. I've met some cool guys on this game, but, like every other game, there is no shortage of sore-losing, butthurt ♥♥♥♥♥♥s that don't get the idea that this is "just a game." Other than that, I haven't really met any trolls or many hackers so far. Just don't hesitate to mute someone if they're giving you a hard time, and you should be alright.\n\nZOMBIES\nZombies. Ah, zombies. The default zombie maps are kind of lame, and like I said earlier, it can be hard to actually find a good game. But if you find a good game, zombies can be a ton of fun and quite challenging. I've literally felt like pulling my hair out when I kept dying over and over again because I ran out of ammo to defend myself against the zombies.\n\nTo sum everything up, lets do a quick pros and cons list.\n\nPROS:\nRuns on lower end computers\nGraphics have aged well\nAddicting multiplayer\nPretty fun singleplayer, even though I haven't played much of it.\nZombies can be fun, if you can find a match.\nCONS:\nRidiculously high price\nHard to connect to a zombies match\nlightly frustrating if you're using default weapons\nQuickscopers. Quickscopers everywhere.\nLack of good zombies maps, without DLC installed.\nMultiplayer: 7/10\nZombies: 5/10\nZombie playerbase: 2/10\nMultiplayer playerbase: 9/10\n\n","April 14","true","7.5"," 33 of 36 people (92%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","92","33","36","6","0"

A legitimate, actual review based on about 400+ hours of gameplay.\n\nFirst and foremost, the campaign. Not much to say about this, it's like every other CoD campaign out there: you're an unstoppable wave of destruction, you listen to a story and click some bots who are terrible at shooting, you go when your "partner" says go and you follow the directions plainly listed to you on your HUD. It's pretty simple, a little playthrough with "stealth" and shooting and you're basically invincible. So, yeah.\n\nMultiplayer, now this is where the review gets serious. I spent a lot of time on multiplayer, prestiged, did my whole thing with getting gold and diamond camos, got good at it, did everything I could. When it comes down to it, I feel Black Ops 2 has probably the greatest variety of weapons I've ever come across in any CoD game. The attachments make it even more expandable, and the pick-10 system Treyarch implemented was one of a kind at the time. This led to some very interesting builds, and added a new depth to the game that really had never been seen in a CoD before. There's SO MUCH to stipulate on, it's a nice break from the pure gun skill that previous CoDs had relied on for so very long. That's not to say that gun skill doesn't exist in Black Ops 2, and lord knows it's required to stand a chance against the competitive community surrounding it, but it's no longer the absolute determining factor for every single gunfight. Attachments, perk sets, tactical and lethal equipment, map knowledge, rushing routes, scorestreaks, all play a part in whether the battlespace is yours or the enemies. Winning and losing is best described as a diesel truck; it takes a bit to get going, but once it starts, it's hard to stop the steamroll. The HUD is asthetically pleasing, along with the scenery and graphics, more so than Ghosts in my opinion. It definitely gives the feel of a futuristic kind of warfare, while not being entirely sci-fi and unreal.\n\nAs for cons, there are as many as there are pros. The maps are my biggest gripe, more focused on fast-paced rounding corners action than firing positions and sightlines. Rushers have definitely been given a big boost in this title, while the more careful approach has been... well, diminished to say the least. This creates an atmosphere that presents an obligation to go in guns blazing or just be destroyed by someone faster. Yeah sure, claymores and shock charges help, but they don't balance the playing field very well. A sniper now has to be able to quickscope and get shots off in split second decisions or be torn in half by a rusher with a vector or a skorpion, it feels a little too fast paced and competitive this time around. If you're not wielding a SMG or shotgun, you're just not gonna be able to stack up against shotgun and SMG users, you just won't. Not to say that CoD hasn't been competitive in the past, but it allowed for all styles of gameplay to be useful and effective. Another gripe I have is the OVERWHELMING DLC that has been presented over the years, it feels more like a cash grab by Treyarch than anything else. It feels pointless, it feels a little bit like advertising to dump more money into a game that you already payed $60 for, for nothing more than a pretty new gun skin and some calling cards. Weapon skins were used to show that you were good with the gun, that gold or diamond camo meant you were at the top of your class with that weapon. Or the earlier games didn't even have weapon skins at all, you learned if the person was good at it just by witnessing the killfeed or watching them in action. Showboating. It's become a main staple of the Black Ops 2 community, and it promotes a far too competitive atmosphere to be enjoyed, and with that tryhardy fanbase, mocking and satire come into play by anyone who isn't actually part of the community. The game is encouraging that showboating by fancy new weapon skins, gold, diamond, weaponized 115, also weapon prestiging or just regular prestiging. Everything about this game is showing how good you are at clicking right trigger or left click. Things just need to be simple again, and not so centered around people who think they're hot ♥♥♥♥.\n\nAs for zombies... basically the same thing again. It's fun, you shoot some zombies with some fancy new guns and get a nice little storyline with it. It feels like an adventure, like you're not told what to do, it's genuinely fun to do with a group of friends and succeed, it feels rewarding. This is what the campaign needed so much more of, actual adventure, and more world exploration, not a bunch of flashing lights, bells, and whistles to make you think you're having fun. I will say, I had a great time playing the zombies campaign of Black Ops 2, they did something right in that department.\n\nAll in all, unless you're a super hardcore FPS player, and you can deal with the occasional ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t of ever so slightly unbalanced gameplay, I wouldn't recommend spending $60 on this game. If you're looking for an alternative, something with a little more think and a little less fast paced, I personally recommend Team Fortress 2, or Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. If you want a game where you can click on some people and have a helicopter do the killing for you if you're good enough, by all means pick this title up. I mean, if it can use up 400 hours of my time, it's gotta be worth something, right? But after all is said and done, I enjoy picking this up again from time to time and just clicking away at some other guys who like to click as well. 7/10","November 19, 2014","true","3.2"," 97 of 141 people (69%) found this review helpful 24 people found this review funny","69","97","141","24","13"

It is a sequel to the previous game Call of Duty: Black Ops in terms of storyline.\n\nCall of Duty: Black Ops II gameplay are quite interesting, compared with Modern Warfare series, this one does have improvements over the first Call of Duty: World at War and Call of Duty: Black Ops. The single player campaign are not so linear, the story goes on depends on how or what you do. For example you could decide if you want Alex Mason, the series character, dead or alive in the end. There is also new Strike Force mode in the campaign, which the success or failure of these mode will affect the story. Strike Force mode let's you control a squad, a robot and many assets to complete the mission, but if the player dies, then it recorded as loss and will affect how the story campaign goes. The Zombie mode are back also, with more feature and more weapons to use, and more zombies too.\n\nCall of Duty: Black Ops II graphics are still not as advanced as Battlefield, but it'll do. After all, Call of Duty is not about graphics I think. But it's not that bad. The performances are also great, very smooth and making Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 performances like ♥♥♥♥.\n\nCall of Duty: Black Ops is a good sequel, has real improvements to the Call of Duty series, it's worth it.

But when I finished it, I realised that I was wrong. I would never believe that I will actually say that this Call of Duty has the best campaign. First of all, I like that you can customize your loadout before starting a mission, which is very good because you can play like you want to, without having to pick up weapons from the ground. The story is brilliant, and not to mention that it's a true sequel to Call of Duty: Black Ops. Another thing I like about the story is that you have many choices during the missions, and they will affect your progress and the game's ending. What is truly amazing is that if you fail to do something, you will not be returned to last checkpoint, but it will affect your ending. The missions are very fun, but the only thing I didn't like is the insane amount of cutscenes during missions, and challenges you complete during missions will not be saved until you finish the mission. I was replaying almost all missions to collect the rest intel but none of it was saved because I didn't know this information.\n\n8/10\n\nMultiplayer\nAfter I tried the multiplayer for the first time, I thought it's nothing but a copy of previous multiplayer modes from other Call of Duty games. Maybe it is, but this one has the best weapons, the best maps, and the best scorestreaks. This game may be set in future, but it's not a distant future, so you don't have jetpacks and it doesn't take a long time to kill someone. There are a lot of players playing the multiplayer, so you can easily find a match. I just don't like the community, because most of players say "easy" when a match ends. And even worse, they either call you a hacker every time you kill them, or they insult you and your family.\n\n9/10\n\nZombies\nPretty much the same as I thought about the muliplayer, but again, I made a huge mistake. I thought it's another boring zombie mode (I was never a fan of zombies), with bad maps and boring gameplay. But no, this zombie mode is actually the best one ever made. The maps are brilliant, especially Town, the weapons are great (pretty much the same ones from campaign and multiplayer). I really love the ranking system which is still kinda mysterious. I highly recommend playing survival on the map Town alone. It is really simple, the size is normal, and there aren't many places so it is like a labyrinth. Town is probably the map where it's easiest to get to the Pack-a-Punch. Somehow, the community is very good, but they will cause problems pretty much. Once I placed a turbine in front of a door to collect a part in that room, and the same guy stole my turbine and the part, and he had no idea what to do with them. So I don't really recommend playing with strangers. The zombie experience is something that you can't just watch others play. You must play it for yourself to see how awesome it is.\n\n\n8/10\n\nOverall\nBefore I played this game, I thought it's the worst Call of Duty, and I didn't like anything about it. After I played it, I realized that it's the best Call of Duty in all ways. I highly recommend getting it, even for the current price. I wouldn't spend an hour for sure if this was another average Call of Duty game.\n\n8/10","April 29","true","28.4"," 28 of 33 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","28","33","2","3"

You've found it. SUNDAY! SUNDAY! SUNDAY!\n\nIt has action. It has excitement. It has guns. OUTSTANDING!\n\nThis is my most played game in my library of 400+ games, every second has been worth it. If you like adrenaline rush gameplay, it's here. If you like boobs, you won't find them here but holy ♥♥♥♥ is the game awesome. It is everything a Hollywood Blockbuster wishes to be, and then some. There is a thrilling, white-knuckle single player campaign that will rack in a whopping 4-5 hours of game time. That's like, an afternoon maybe! It's crazy.\n\nDice, Chop & Mince In Seconds! You never need to switch blades, chop up vegetables, nuts, & fruits, quickly and easily. With every slap, the finer the food gets and it is easy to clean and the Graty is dishwasher safe. You can't beat that. Now let's break down some features, yeah?\n\n1) A brand new, cutting edge and innovative single player campaign with new characters, new guns and new new.\n\n2) A Cornucopia of multiplayer modes and features. Wanna hop online and shoot people? Check.\n\n3) Now the famous, super-soft fleece blanket that has sleeves comes in super-stylish leopard print! It keeps you cozy, leaves your hands free and won't slip or slide like regular blankets. Machine wash and dry. Imported. 71" x 54".\n\n4) It has more DLC than The Sims franchise. Keep adding onto your experience!\n\nSo what else does the game offer for your hard earned Bison Bucks? Well, there's rim lighting, character self-shadowing, texture streaming and physics-enabled effects add incredible realism. This was implemented in Modern Warfare, but hot damn it's here too! There's also a 1-4 player mode called Tranzit, 'cause Z's make everything more intenze. Tranzit is open world co-op. New maps, too! You wanted 'em, you got 'em. Open spaces, tight corners and all the lag you hate are all here for a rich, immersive online gaming experience. Now, I beat the game's single player campaign in about 20 minutes or so, give or take because I've been playing CoD games since Black Ops I, so I'm a seasoned Vet. Your mileage may, and probably will, vary.\n\nAlthough many players never even once try the campaign after dishing $60 for the dang game, the single player is a lot of fun. Treyarch introduces choices for the campaign; some of which affect which of the three endings you get. Additionally, new optional missions called Strike Force are included.\n\nDo I recommend this? Absolutely. And if you get a PHYSICAL copy, get the Care Package. It has lots of goodies like the following:\n\n- Rotisserie Body with Glass Door\n- Dual-heating tray with lid\n- Spit Rod Assembly (2-wheels and 2 spit rods)\n- Flat Spit Basket\n- Drip Tray with Grate Cover\n- Spit Loading Base\n- BBQ Gloves\n- 12-Elastic Food Ties\n- Instructional Booklet and DVD\n\nBut what about Zombies? Zombies is where the game really shines. The new maps are tons of fun to explore, discover secrets on, and of course kill zombies. DLC gets lots of criticism, but the maps are usually worth it! The maps are very well done and Zombies' fun gameplay does a lot to breathe life into this otherwise overdone series. (But let's be honest, it ain't overdone at all, haha. Scrubs)\n\nAnd the game is really a breeze to get into if you're a nub. You just gotta hop online and hold your trigger key, and pray. It's the Call of Duty way. And to all the people saying this game is a 0/10... really? Seriously giving this game a 0? What does that say about your credibility. If you're going to write a review, at least be honest and say whats wrong with it. Hell, for a game to get a 0, it would need to not work. Give it a 4-6 if you like and say why. That way, people might at least get some insight into your review rather than "Piece of crap" etc., etc. This game ain't the best but it sure as hell isn't a 0. And seriously, if this game was a 0, and MW3 was a 0, then why the hell are they continually breaking record sales?

Even though I recommend this game, there are still some points you need to know.\nThis has to be if not the best but one of the best call of duty titles out there. Oh, I love the colors in this game. All 3 game modes are enjoyable, but as you can tell, the main thing we are going to focus is the multiplayer.\nFirst of all, campaign. Black Ops II brought us a great campaign with a good story which continues Black Ops I's. If you played previous cod titles, this one will probably not look much different for you. However, it was a good idea that here you continue previous storyline and also play as a new character from future. Oh yes, about future. This futuristic cod had it right on its right level. Why? Because futuristic things did not affect gameplay, yet it was mainly for visual look. During the gameplay, you are given some options which only change cutscenes between levels and the ending only. I am not going to spoil storyline, but I definitely suggest you to pass it at least once.\nZombies. Well, even though the regular map "Green Run" frustrated for lots of reasons such as lava, denizens, large map size, worst wonder weapon and etc. The rest maps are really awesome. "Die Rise" is fun map but sucks when it comes to glitches, stupid perk and falling from the map. "Buried" is interesting when you setup and see how the map itself looks but it gets too repeating and boring if you camp which is the main strategy to play it. "Mob of the Dead" is the map which lots of fans loved and it is satisfying for reasons. It is unusual due to its "ghost" mode, awesome wonder weapon, nice setup system, cool atmosphere and great training spot. "Origins". Ok, this map is the best one ever created. Why? It finally brough us characters from WaW and the time of world war I. There are so many things to do, lots of training spots, many wonder weapons, puzzles, challenges with awards and so on. Forgot to mention, to play these maps you need to have dlcs, which of course sucks.\nNow, multiplayer. I can talk about this all day, but I will try my best to explain as shortly as possible. BO2 awards you scorestreaks by killing and now also completing definite objectives.One of the best things about mutiplayer is that this is the most played cod multiplayer on pc. There are at least from 3K up to 10K people playing at one moment. There are many great maps like Nuketown 2025, Carrier, Raid, Hijacked, Studio. Oh no. By the way, if you are going to play only mutiplayer, do not bother buying any dlcs. They will not just make it better, no. Dlcs will make it even worse making it unplayable because only few players own them and there will be only 1 game mode playable and it is "team deathmatch". Personally, I had much fun playing this game, but now, it is not as much fun as it used to be at the beginning. Because you understand what is happening, how other people are playing. Eh... Let us talk about these "players". There are 3 types which probably will annoy the crap out of you: tryhards, campers and hackers. Do not get me wrong, it is still enjoyable enough to play bo2 even with these human species. It is not my excuse of calling them tryhards. I am pretty sure I am a good player. They are just insanely sweaty people always playing with the same overpowered weapons like an-94, scar-h, c4. Their game style is mostly either dropshooting or jumpshooting. I wish their pcs burnt somehow, but anyways now let us talk about campers. Camping is alternative option to play for sure. Yeah... I do not care if some machine gunner or sniper camps, but how cannot I rage if there is some autistic smg gunner, shotgunner or even assault rifler hiding in the corner waiting for someone to come and then these campers shoot their back? I cannot stand it. Also guess who also annoy more? Hackers! Where the hell is our VAC system? There are so many hackers in cod games in mw2 which it led to the point why most players quitted it because it is unplayable now. There are not as many hackers as in its predecessors, but anyways, it makes you either leave the game or keep dying because one or few people have "vsat hack". Let me clear this up for you. There is scorestreak "vsat" which you can activate after you earned it, but there is some hacking program or mod called "vsat hack" which activates in every hacker's game. It basically is a wallhack. There are so many challenges which award you more XP points, calling cards and title emblems. Oh my lord. The whole emblem system is so good in this game, because there is a big variety of forms. If you are a professional or just follow tutorials on youtube, you can make beautiful emblems so you can add them to your profile and weapons. Theatre mode is little glitchy with its hitboxes as always but it does not make it any worse due to its pros. It records any game you have played recently and what is more is that you can make montage right there even from different player's point of view or angle of map. Well, I was about to forget about game and lobby finding system in this game. Yeah there are no dedicated servers... It is not a big deal to be honest but it sucks when you keep getting into the same lobby over and over again. The weapons, perks and equipment are pretty balanced here. Although there are now some things that are overpowered. C4. Oh... Please do not run with scavenger, fast hands perks and keep c4ing everyone. I beg of you. An-94. Why is this overpowered? I will tell. It kills in 3 bullets in most of the time, has no recoil, yet has great iron sight, and main thing why I am mentioning this is that the speed of the first 2 bullets come as fast as the fire speed of average smg 950 rpm and then shoots as common fire speed for assault rifles 750 rpm. I may be made a little mistake with numbers, but I did not exagerrate anything! I could not say that community is bad. You will meet nice people as well as idiotic ones, too. Here is a tip for you. Mute everybody in your lobby and enjoy the game. However, there is a chat. Do not bother reading it. I wish you good luck if you are playing exclusive for pc game "Nukejacked". There people play only 2 maps: Nuketown 2025 and Hijacked but with all possible game modes in game. But the thing is that the maximum amount of players is higher than usual and most of the time you will play on hardcore which makes your health 30%, little regeneration, no HUD, no map, no killcam. Also mainly in Nuketown 2025 there is decent chance to get spawn trapped by some lmg spraying dumb across the map. So just keep that in mind.\nThe main reason why I love this game and franchise overall, is that there are many variations to play from only knife running class to a complete terminator with 2 lmgs. Yeah...\nThat is all I guess. I may edit this review few times. Sorry I do not know what to write for tl;dr people. I am really thankful for everyone who read my review!","September 20, 2015","true","22.0"," 35 of 47 people (74%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","74","35","47","8","6"

Now its much easier to understand this one.\n\nMultiplayer\nThe focuse of the game is clearly the Multiplayerpart of the game.\nI played it now for >23 hours and had tons of fun in there. I like this fast actiongameplay of Call of Duty.\nEspecially with friends it makes even more fun, if your in the same team or not does not really matter.\nI dont know if I am the only one who observed that, but the multiplayermaps like Nukedown and Hijacked were much more beautiful than the locations in the singleplayercampaign.\n\nFazit\nIn the end Call of Duty Black Ops II gets a 7/10 from me, but only because of the Multiplayerpart.\n\nI really hope Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare brings us better grafics.

That kind of really freshens up the game.\nThe game also has strike missions, where you can command your troops in an RTS manner, and take control of anyone. Unfortunately, those were very poorly done. Cause your AI just can't fight the enemy, and you have to do most of the work. Maybe adding the coop would have fixed that, cause the idea is a very unique one, it was just badly executed.\nSadly they still have linear levels, so I don't really suggest you to get it for it's singleplayer\n\nZombies\nThey added a new mode - tranzit. There are 5 big locations on this map, and a bus that takes you to them. They also included "buildables", you find parts scattered on the map and you build the item. This mode is a really refreshing experience. A splendid job they did there.\n\nMultiplayer\nWell, the multiplayer I didn't like, just like MW3, it was pleasing the noobs\n1)Overpowered Guns(especially SMG's)\n2)Instead of 10 mins match, there are 2 rounds each 5 mins in most game modes\n3)Well, still quite bad spawns(though not as bad as in MW3)\n4)The leveling up to the highest level took 3 days\n5)Unlike MW3, they did add new stuff, but they are so easily achievable\n6)In Gun Game and other game modes of it's type they have "Always on UAV", which ruins the point of the game modes\n7)And still, quite small maps\nNow the good thing about multiplayer is the new create a class\nYou can choose only 10 items in your loadout, I think they should carry that on to the next COD's\n\nThey improved the prestige system. First of all I want to mention that this game has a level cap of 55. Everytime you level up you get a token, which you can spend on a perk/weapon/killstreak/equipment. 55 tokens isn't really enough, and it was done on purpose. Now it kind of gives meaning to actually prestige, so that you will be able to test out everything.\n\nThere are 10 prestiges in the game, when you reach prestige 10, you receive the rest of the gear. Other then that, the game also has MW3's Prestige Shop and Prestige Unlock Tokens. The Prestige Shop gives you 3 options, you can either erase all your stats and set back to level 1(without prestige), add an additional loadout or keep all your tokens. The Prestige Unlock Tokens give you an ability to choose any gear, and permanently unlock it, you get 1 per prestige.\n\nThe other good thing is that you no longer have your challenges and weapon attachments/camouflage erased when prestiging. Instead they decided to put it in a separate category. Now there is a weapon prestige, allowing you to completely erase all your weapon unlocks on that specific weapon, once you reached weapon's max level.You are allowed to do that 2 times. They reward you with an ability to put your clan name and emblem on that weapon.\n\nOne really annoying thing though, are the outdated graphics. This is an AAA title, so I had to mention that. They don't have a low budget, so there is no excuse for them being that outdated.\n\nConclusion: I give it a below average score. The game is better then MW3. In fact I have to say, if you judge it by it's singleplayer and coop then you may call it the best out of all COD's, but the core of COD for the past 7 years been the multiplayer, and that's what BO2 is lacking of. So I am not really suggesting you to get it, considering that they don't even give it a decent discount.","April 30, 2013","false","61.2"," 164 of 283 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","164","283","0","2"

You collaberate with your team to overcome the other teams advanced strategy. In the story mode, you play as Black Op, who's objective is to kill everything in his path, whether it be civillian or enemy, as the game doesn't penalize you for either. Anyways, once you shoot everythin, you are overcome with the fact that  you killed your family . When you realize that, you kill yourself, and then go to hell. In hell, you must combat many baboons who try to rip your skull out. When you complete this, you awaken from your coma, and decide to continue killing all living beings. Eventually, you get tired, so you drink some Mountain Dew and eat some Doritos for strength. This unlocks the multiplayer mode, where you can only spin around and shoot, otherwise people tell you they slept with your mom. This is most likely true, but even so, you have to work together as a team to win the objective.

Well, I personally don't think this is the best game in the series, but it's not the worst one either. Quite far from that.\n\nThe campaign feels just like a Treyarch campaign from the very beginning so I'm sure you will like this one if you enjoyed the first Black Ops. Though I also have to say that to me, the story felt very slow and uninteresting for the first few missions and only started getting better and better towards the ending, where it luckily didn't disappoint and lived fully up to the Call of Duty name. Explosions, emotions, action.\n\nThough it's not just your usual Call of Duty campaign. It's very obvious that they have tried to innovate, so apart from the story being separated into the futuristic setting of 2025 and the ending of the Cold War (in a way of flashbacks), there's also a brand new game mode, if that's a proper term for it. It's called Strike Force, seemingly involves more strategy as it's something along the lines of a real-time strategy, and it's a design nightmare and it sucks. There, I said it.\n\nAnd because that wouldn't be enough to call it innovated, the campaign is pretty complex compared to the previous Call of Duty titles. Why is that? Well, there are multiple paths and endings, and the story actually changes around your actions, to a certain degree. It's not the best thing you'll ever see, but it was a pleasant surprise that the heavily advertised player choices weren't just A or B options in dialogues, but rather something that just happens in the background depending on what you do.\n\nThe multiplayer of Call of Duty: Black Ops II feels like a Call of Duty. I mean, yeah, really, what's there to say? There are guns and tons of game modes and scorestreaks and all that good stuff, though to me - apart from the great new system of class creation in which you can pretty much create any combination you desire - it felt like a downgrade from the first Black Ops game. I found it to be based less on skill and more on who knows the wall-banging spots better and can cooperate with their party to abuse the game to death, or your death, and your team's death because boo-hoo you just lost the match.\n\nBut yeah, it can be enjoyable, even more so if you play it with a group of friends. Hey, talking friends, I haven't mentioned the Zombies mode yet. It's obviously returning in this title, it has zombies and you shoot them for points and then exchange the points for weapons and the like. And it goes exactly like in every other title with the Zombies mode in - if you like cooperating in shooting zombie heads and have friends who like cooperating in shooting zombie heads, it can be fun.\n\nBlack Ops II was an average Call of Duty title to me - I'd pick Modern Warfare 3 over it any day, though.","December 9, 2015","true","6.6"," 17 of 22 people (77%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","77","17","22","2","0"

This is mostly on multiplayer.\n\nSo yep, Black Ops 2, not just that it is a pretty solid CoD-game with solid mechanics, it's also a pretty good PC-Port. Treyarch sure did a great (maybe even the best) job since the last CoD-game with a proper server browser and freedom (that being CoD4 and World at War - Black Ops 1 was not such a good port performance-wise). It may rely on matchmaking as seen since Modern Warfare 2, but uses dedicated servers instead of player-hosted servers. Also, quite a neat amount of PC-related settings to optimise the game or even give it better-than-consoles graphics and a FOV-Setting!\n\nAlso runs at a rock-solid 120+ FPS here (can be set to have a maximum FPS cap of 200 FPS) with no drop-downs below that on max settings, while looking just a tad bit worse than Ghosts - which by itself runs at a varying 45-90 FPS at most times... So yeah, ports-wise it's a great CoD.\n\nSadly though, the bad taste of Modern Warfare 3 (which was awful, port-wise) probably kept a lot of people from getting Black Ops 2.\n\nStill has a good-enough playerbase now to easily find TDM matches, too.","October 25, 2014","true","10.7"," 32 of 52 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","32","52","0","0"

With amazing graphics gorgeous gameplay and lovely music.\nThis Time there is something new to the CoD Campaign which I never seen before. In some parts of the game, the game gives you the choice. Which means everybody will experience something different but it makes it also replayable to see what you missed out and what would off happened if you would off choosed something else, a little bit like the Tell Tale Games.\nAnother new thing which was new introduced into the Call of Duty Campaign Series was that before each Mission Starts you can choose your own class almost like you do it in Multiplayer, which makes the game more fun and leaves you more choices.\n\nMultiplayer:\nThe Multiplayer is one of the best games that got released and is so far one of the last call of dutys that is still playable. The Settings have a native FOV Slider that goes up to 90 and also have Borderless Fullscreen Mode which is for me personally important with 2 screens. There is also a ping filter where you can decide to what kind of people you would like to connect for example would you rather play with 300 ping or with 30? Its up to you. Also this game is one of the only games that has dedicated servers.\nThere are 5 standard classes already unlocked and with each prestige you can get another one (up to 10 classes). With each Prestige comes also a permanent unlock tocken, which means if you prestige and your favourite weapon is for example going to be unlocked at level 50, you can permanently unlock it right away. Everytime you prestige your guns stay the same level, keep their cammos and attachments unlike Moderen Warfare 3 where you lose everything. Which makes it easier to get gold cammos or diamond cammos.\nYou can get diamond Cammo which is another first for the Call of Duty Series, if you want to get diamond guns you have to go through all the challenges for one class for example the smgs, once you got all gold, the diamond cammo will be unlocked. Those Challenges are alot of fun to do. So if you ever get bored of just brainlessly killing people or you like games where you can work towards something than you should try this out.\n\nZombies:\nThe Zombie Mode comes by default with 1 Map the Bus Depot you can buy more maps by purchasing the DLC or the Season Pass. The Zombie Mode itself is fair and has good graphics, sometimes it can be a bit glitchy but 99,9% of the time you won't find anything wrong with it. The Graphics are amazing and there is as well as in Number 1 always a hidden Song. You can complete the Bus Depot Map on your own or together with a friend (I recommend 2 people). The Story is really facinating and I hope it is going to continue in Number 3.\nBut you do not have to play the Story on Zombies, you also can play turned, where you fight as a zombie against your friends and Survival where you are just in one spot and can see how many rounds you will make it until the zombies finally got you.\n\nFor Achievement Hunters:\nThe Singleplayer should be easy to complete.\nThe Multiplayer is also easy to complete as long as you have a good team to play in the League Mode.\nThe Zombie Mode will require alot of work and is rather hard to do. Mostly you won't be able to do it on your own, so for some maps you will need up to 4 people with good communication possibilitys.\n\nAll in all, this game is wonderful. Yes I know there is a few cheaters in the multiplayer, but unlike other games you can record or even make pictures and send your proof + steam id of the cheater, to the actuall developers and they will ban the cheater.\nSee also my Guide:  Guide for how to report a Cheater\n\nDue to the fact that this is one of the only games that have dedicated servers and Developers that still banning people it is playable and can be still alot of fun. Another important thing I forgot to say is, that it is very well optimised and I had no problems running it whatsoever on max graphics. It also supports 120fps screens. Personally this is my favourite Call of Duty so far.","October 25, 2015","true","5.4"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","13","17","0","2"

I installed it only around November of the following year and got to actually play it somewhat in beginning of May.\nAnd, yes, I underestimated it.\nThe game itself looks better than its ancestors in fact, it is clearly seen at points, faces show expressions and the characters don't look like robots...The graphics did become better as well, comparing to MW3, it's made a decent leap. Everything, looks better, somewhat like Mirror's Edge especially to the end of the game when things start exploding (YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAH).\nThe story is divided into three parts. Let me tell about every of them in short:\n\nFirst story:\nAs usual, flashbacks of Woods, who did survive in Laos (or it was Vietnam?..) Anyway, this looks pretty interesting, has some stupid moments, some ridiculous twists, but to be honest, I liked this part the most. It ends at somewhat middle of entire game\n\nSecond story:\nThe main part, protagonist of which is son of Alex Mason, who follows old foe of his father and so on and so forth. This part takes place in 2025. it has some futuristic features, but all in all, the gameplay is pretty sample to first. I didn't like this one too much, even though it has a pretty charismatic character named Harper, and that it has the most conscious plot...The thing is that this part looks a lot like Crysis because of those future weapons and stuff. I know, that it hardly would look any different, if you want to make some close-future shooter, but still.\n\nThird story:\nIs kinda the ♥♥♥♥♥iest for me. You command a squad that goes all around the world, defending different places from the main villain's troops. It's made as a tactical part of game, you have around 10 soldiers and machines under your control and you can control every of them on your own, but as tactics it's pretty useless...Choose all your troops and command to attack enemy, not a big deal. I finished it as well, so there.\n\nThe thing I did like about the game is the variety of endings. The thing is that the only two things you're going to care for are Woods and Harper, so that doesn't matter way much, but in game it is pretty exciting, to choose things, knowing it may affect the game\n\nSound is good, I really liked the ending, even though not fan of A7X, but yeah, pretty cool\n\nI hardly played multiplayer, but it looks pretty fun too, a lot like MW2 which I did like\n\nIn the end, would I recommend this game? Yes, if you're afraid to waste your time on one more "CoD ♥♥♥♥♥♥ shooter omg", then leave your fears, it's pretty decent even though pretty easy (played on hard difficulty, died only 7 times throughout the game, the squad was lost only once)\n\nIn the end, I'd say 8.4/10. Would have been better if not that stupid tactical feature\nThanks for reading, play games!","May 17, 2014","true","7.6"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","13"

No idea if they are good or bad. SHOOT EM!\nAlso ... you are on a horse. Which makes the singleplayer badass.\n\n\nFor the zombies:\n\nThey are cute. The maps are really nice and you can do lots of things on them, building stuff, set yourself up. If the rest of your team is not playing the game with their nose or randomly insulting and trolling around. So ahhm... nope you can't. Sorry.\nBut the game basicly offers it which is positive. Right? RIGHT!\n\n\nTHE MULTIPLAYER!\n\nNever played any CoD, was allways more of a battlefield guy ... I guess. Well friends kept asking. So I checked out which one could be best opt for PC. Seems to be this one.\n\nSo for the game. Ahm o_0\nYou spawn, you shoot at massive big gigantic insane awesome random MOTHER OF GAWD ........... hitboxes. No srsly... the hitboxes are like an aura. I like auras. Who not? Seen freakingh star wars 1000 times.\n\nYou'll find cute creatures next to you, doin' 360 720 s switching weapons. And shooting a bullet across the map for whatever reason while the enemy is calling in streak after streak and bringing uup freaking Lord of the dance stoppin you into particles. You know... these lil tiny nuclear once... at least that would explain why ppl keep mention ZOMFG nuCLEAR \o/\n\nSometimes you will find yourself in a gamemode which is kinda objective based. Like ahm ... flags waving and you can take those points. Or dogtags you cooooooooooouuld pick up. But mostly you will find yourself getting some Lord of the Dance streak as soon you reach those points. So nvm that.\n\nSo for gunhandling. Ah ye. Allways bunnyhop, then throw yourself prone. First time I've seen that... I was like the fug is that dude dancing??!?!? o_0... yep lost of dancing here.\nNo worries abouut any weapon sway or aiming off or and spread increasing while you are hip hop hup haddehhup wabbiting around. THERE IS NON!\n\nThe whole movement works pretty good, hitreg is working, yoou need to let em that. And i guess thats why it sells so darn good. Right? DICE?! YES I AM ASKING YOU!!!!!!!\n\nThen there are these full prestiged (ranked out) I don't even need a weapon to kill ya bro ppl. So. Just ignore that. If they kill you, it will happen out of nowhere, you won't get a clue how and why. Just accept it. WON'T YOU ASK! They can! Yo not! Simple!\n\nAh ye. Turn off the VOIP and chatbox. Treat them like bots. I've turned it on, and seen some of the fines bottom line insulting ever.\n\nYou can also check other steam profiles. You don't wanna do that either. Every 2. - 3. check you will see a VAC ban on a profile. No idea if that is supposed to be psychological warfare. But it really is like that.\n\n\nSo ahm.\nYe great game.\nIf you don't go tryhard mode all the way. The hitreg is working, The movement and the controls working pretty good.\nVery rare that you'll get a disconnection. I think happent to me 2 or 3 times. So thats all fine.\n\nAnd the really good stuff ... and ye I mean GOOD!\nLobby joining :D I mean come on. ded servers are so 2010. Lobbies are the thang! It will basicly do one thing or another for you. Depending on what type of player you are.\n1. choice:\nYou can relax, get some coffee, maybe cook some dinner, spend a bit of youur time with your family. You know... those ppl you see in the kitchen now and then. Introduce yourself to them. They'll be suprised.\n2. choice:\nIt will turn youu pi**sh** insane and you will end up beeing the one playing this game with your nose and random insulting ppl all over the place.\nYES! Lobbies can do that.\n\n\nNow get black ops 2. Its a freaking good game! Oh and the cyborg customisation DLC. Cuz its glowing on your gun!

The Black Ops 2 campaign isn't great but it is good for a military shooter it features a hudge charecter set and the story line based on all of America's US millertary drones turning on the US and wiping out major populations and cities it has a back story and a futeristic look and playthough as you complete this awesome campaign. Inbetween missions you have combats stats and are able to unlock more things as you got, combat stats are mainly earned by completing missions and mainly missions like the S.P.E.C misions which is where you have to fight in places such as india, pakistan and china trying to gain controll over the areas it earns you more unlocks as well as combat stats inproving so you're able to unlock more and more.\n\nMultiplayer: Multiplayer is key focused on objectives such as CTF, TDM, KC, Domination, and Demolition, ect. It helps your clan/sqaud play through and improve and rank up it is on of the most awesome multiplayers featured in the treyrch series and is definitly every cent worthy. Hardcore is anoth list of modes where you can't use radar all the time, you can only use your eyes and stratigic skills, it is mainly for people who have had alot of experince and think they're up for it.\n-Party Games are another great playlist featuring game modes such as Sticks and Stones: A gamemode using only balistic knives (Knives witch are able to shoot rods/ one shot kill), Crossbow (Rods once you shoot blow up your enimie like a lethel semtex granade), and finally the combat axe that alows you to through your axe up to phanomanal distances to kill and enimay.\n\nAnd Finally ZOMBIES! - Zombies mode feature four players maximuim the players are fighting (you guessed it) blood thirsty zombies who will stop at nothing to kill you and your team mates, the maps are always diffrent in previous times but are simular in most aspects, but on Black Ops 2 if you didn't buy dlcs you start on a mode called tranzit and every map in tranzit  is free to play singly without having to play tranzit/ tranzit is recomended by almost everyone who plays it reason being it's a fun and addictive game mode with features you and your friend riding in a bus stop at unknown locations such at the bus depo (Spawn) the Dinner (first place fore the mistory box) (misterory box moves around the map just like in every other treyarc mode execped for World at War's nazi zombies) The farm: a location for the hatch for the bus (sometimes) and the crop field power station a white place beneth the building (unknown so far) where your able to turn th epower on to achive drinks such as Juggernod, spped cola, ect. And every 5 rounds a power monster comes to kill you who's only weekneace is by going back and turning th epower off and back on.\n\n\nDLC's: I myself have all 4 dlc's five if you include zombie nuketown and i have experinced every weapon ther eis I can say so far that every aspect of Black Ops 2 zombies is a fun/ horrorfing blood goring experince witch is worth the money and the dlcs feature four maps witch I wont go into detail all i can say is I like all of the in atleast one way minimuim and are worth it.","December 30, 2013","true","130.7"," 16 of 24 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","16","24","0","7"

It is a sequel to the previous game Call of Duty: Black Ops in terms of storyline.\n\nCall of Duty: Black Ops II gameplay are quite interesting, compared with Modern Warfare series, this one does have improvements over the first Call of Duty: World at War and Call of Duty: Black Ops. The single player campaign are not so linear, the story goes on depends on how or what you do. For example you could decide if you want Alex Mason, the series character, dead or alive in the end. There is also new Strike Force mode in the campaign, which the success or failure of these mode will affect the story. Strike Force mode let's you control a squad, a robot and many assets to complete the mission, but if the player dies, then it recorded as loss and will affect how the story campaign goes. The Zombie mode are back also, with more feature and more weapons to use, and more zombies too.\n\nCall of Duty: Black Ops II graphics are still not as advanced as Battlefield, but it'll do. After all, Call of Duty is not about graphics I think. But it's not that bad. The performances are also great, very smooth and making Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 performances like ♥♥♥♥.\n\nCall of Duty: Black Ops is a good sequel, has real improvements to the Call of Duty series, it's worth it.

From reading the other reviews, I'm not interested in the multiplayer aspect as it seems it is full of hackers and cheats which to me doesn't make a good experience. I can never understand why people would want to cheat in the first place. It doesn't make it enjoyable for the hackers and cheats or anyone else.\n\nAnyway, onto my experience of the campaign. The word I would use to sum up my experience is frustrating. The story, graphics and shooting are all amazing. Thats the good news. The problem is that the game constantly crashes. In my two hours of playtime, the game must have crashed about forty times. Each time it crashes, the only way I can rectify it is to log out of windows, log back in and start again. From such a big publisher making so much money I find this kind of thing totally unacceptable.\n\nI'm pretty new to pc gaming but in my experience many games from big publishers seem to have many problems. Having to constantly jump through hoops just to do simple things like change the resolution in a game, sometimes spending hours looking at forums but not finding a fix is not my idea of fun. It makes me just want to dust off my PS4 and play a game that I know will work straight away.\n\nAt present, I have deleted the game and I'm currently reinstalling it to give it another go. If it still doesn't work then I've just wasted just over £13 on something that doesn't work properly. It could be good but I can't recommend it.","April 16","false","4.0"," 19 of 30 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","19","30","0","12"

It is set in near future, showing us weapons that will be important in modern day warfare.\nSingle player was nice. The game have more different endings. You can also edit your loadout before starting the mission, which is nice innovation and improvent that BO2 is offering us.\n\nLets go to multiplayer. I played almost every CoD out there and BO2 is definetly my favourite one. If you want to buy great game to play with your friends, than Bo2 is must buy game.\nAwesome emblem editor, theatre mode, great scorestreak and nice perk system is making this my favourite CoD game. Multiplayer is playable without any major lag. You have a lot of different camos, that are making game even more interesting and fun.\n\nLets go to zombies now. You have one standard map,called Tranzit. Personally,i do not like it too much. If you want true zombie experience you need to try dlc maps.\n\nBo2 is game that really ruined my social life. I played 1100+ hours of multiplayer and I still have feeling that i did not try half of things in game. This is must have game for every multiplayer and first person shooter fan.\n\n10/10","February 3, 2014","true","7.0"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","11","15","2","0"

I bet there's gonna be some awesome character development, and a solid storyline." However, this game does have a campaign. I have been playing it on Veteran mode, which is the highest difficulty, and the biggest challenge I have encountered so far is a ladder. I can't get past it, and according to Google, a myriad of people have the same problem I'm having, and the only solution that MIGHT work is to redo the entire mission from the start.\n\nThis game won't reward you with the simple joy of progression if you don't do things exactly the way it wants you to. If you like to think before taking action, go play Arma or something, this is a run n' gun bonanza. If you're interested in this game's single player content, please do yourself a favor and don't buy it at full price. Hell, don't buy it on sale. Don't even borrow it from a friend, don't accept it as a gift, and if someone is willing to pay you money to play it, keep your dignity and politely refuse.\n\nHaving said that, the multiplayer is probably fun, but I didn't care enough to find out yet.\nIf you see me playing Black Ops 2, it's because I am a masochistic idiot, and I'm trying to get my money's worth from this hemorrhoid of a game.","April 17, 2014","false","3.6"," 18 of 30 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","18","30","0","4"

He liked to be called Joey. He was a nice fellow, with a few close friends. The local ladies who saw him sometimes bowling at the local Bowl-o-Rama Bowling Alley said he was pleasant on the eyes. He was a nice guy to be around, and a very pleasant conversationalist. He knew all the right things to say, and never seemed to be on anyone's bad side. He never had a run in the with local police, and was very straight and narrow. He owned an auto parts store in town. the shop being one of only 2 auto places in town was profitable, leaving Joey to skip the 9 to 5 grind, and have plenty of free time to pursue more leisurly activities. Joey was American as apple pie, and loving life to the fullest. He did have a girlfriend, whom he had even asked to marry him recently. She gladly accepted. Joey's life seemed set.\n\nJoey was a good wholesome average man, with lots to live for. Which is why none of the rest of this makes sense...\n\nOn the night of September 14th, 2012, Joey was last seen sitting outside of his 2 story home, on his steps. A neighbor recalls seeing Joey through her window across the street. Joey appeared to be shaking, wearing only what appeared to be a towel, shorts (possibly boxers), and no shoes on. He looked a mess. The neighbor went downstairs, and when she went out of her door to see if Joey was okay, he was gone. She went to his front door and rang the doorbell, but there was no answer.\n\n2 days later, Joey's body was found outside of town washed up in a riverbed.\n\nPolice say there was no signs of foul play, and it appeared that he had commited suicide by jumping off a bridge located further upstream, breaking his neck on impact. None of this made sense. This man, whom was recently engaged and not in any trouble financially or otherwise, took his own life? This made no sense at all.\n\nPolice searched his home and found no evidence of foul play. When they searched his den, the lights were flickering off and on, with a faint humming coming from a computer fan. The computer had been left on. Maybe there were clues here? One officer walked up to the computer desk, and touched the mouse enough to get the computer out of sleep mode. what he saw haunted him. A few seconds later, the computer monitor sparked, and then it shut off. It had died. As well as the computer with it.\n\nHaunted by what he had seen, officer Henry King mentioned none of this to other officers, and left what he had seen on the screen out of his report.\n\n4 days later, Henry King was found dead in his apartment.

Like any FPS, you will get killed by things you did not know were coming.  Even the most well-captioned FPS game will have uncaptioned audio cues for imminent danger.  That said, Black Ops 2 does okay in this category, but doesn't break the mold.\n\nSubtitles/Text\nSubtitles for single player are just subtitles - no captions - but they help tell the story.  I do feel that they are a little slow, though, for key moments when you have to react quickly.  For multiplayer, there are no captions or subtitles.  You are on your own.\n\nChatting/Communicating\nBO2 allows text chat, but most players make use of voice chat in my experience.  In the lobby, you can ONLY use voice chat - there is no input for text there.","June 24, 2013","true",""," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/xpliciit/recommended/202970/","xpliciit","Xpliciit","http://steamcommunity.com/id/xpliciit/","178 products in account","W.I.P Review - (Work In Progress)\n\nFirstly since Black Ops 2 comes as 3 separate games on your Steam Games List when you buy it (Black Ops 2 - Campaign, Black Ops 2 Multiplayer & Black Ops 2 Zombies) i will be reviewing them all here split into thier own sections to make it easier to see which part of the game i will be reviewing.\n\nBlack Ops 2 - Campaign\n\nThe campaign to this game is really good in my opinion, i have thoroughly enjoyed pretty much every mission.  The story line is not too bad and links in with previous story lines from Treyarcs CoD games.  The graphics i run at maximun are not too bad either but there are parts of various missions in which there are most certainly texture issues or misplaced objects which you can see in my steam screenshots for this game.\n\nThe campaign is as with every other CoD just as explosive and violent with so much variety in the scenery or vehicles you can use etc.  One thing i do like in this campaign is being able to use an Access Kit during every mission, which allows access to various perks such as Drones, ASD's or CLAW's (Military Automated Units) and also things like Flak Jackets for reduced explosive damage and alternative Melee weapons.  Some parts are as with previous CoD's overly excessive with violence but it doesnt make the game any less fun in my opinion.\n\nAlso as with many previous CoD games there are Intel's to collect in each mission, however something i liked in this game is that there are two versions of Intel - One for missions based in the Past, and one version for the missions based in the Future. There are also Challenges for each mission which if completed allow access to more perks and more powerful weapons to use in the missions ahead or previous missions if you use the Replay Mission feature (after completing story).\n\nThe last feature i do like in this game was the ability to choose your weapons setup before starting a mission. You are able to choose both a primary and secondary weapon of your choosing with up to 3 attachments too.  Then you can also choose your grenades and perks too. Some grenades, weapons or perks are required to do the challenges in the game but sometimes those particular missions would also have the required weapon laying around nearby. Also challenges are not necessary to complete so its not super important if you dont take any particular weapon, grenade or perk.\n\nAchievements - Achievements are also separate for each part of this game, the Achievements for the campaign part are all pretty straightforward, the most difficult being to complete every single challenge in every single mission including the StrikeForce missions.\n\nCons\n\nThe bad points i have picked up on having played this game are as follows:\n\n- Lag\n\nFor some unknown reason at some point in pretty much every single mission i had huge lag spikes where my FPS (Frames Per Second) would drop to like 2 FPS.  I have an absoloute beast of a computer and could run max graphics 100% of the time with no issues but these random lag spikes hit for like upto around 15 seconds where i can barely turn or anything because its going so slow.  Its not based on internet in this case as its purely singleplayer even if you disconnect internet and play its the same issue.  Fortunately this only happens about once on every map for no more than 15 seconds and may have not happened at all some times.  The only reason i say every mission is because i have played through each mission multiple times to get every challenge complete for the achievements.\n\n- Cinematics\n\nThis game has ALOT of cinematics, and they are very good and work well alongside the missions and quite often during the missions.  Therefore i have absoloutly no issue with the cinematics at all and this should not put the average player off at all.  However, if you are attempting to do EVERY SINGLE CHALLENGE in order to get EVERY SINGLE ACHIEVEMENT, you have to play through each mission multiple times and it takes a very long time watching the cinematics over and over again.  Some you can skip fairly quickly, sometimes you have to watch for like 30 seconds before it can be skipped and you can start the mission.  But the in-game cinematics 9 times out of 10 cant be skipped and takes forever to just continue with the mission to get your challenges or whatever.\n\nWould be very nice to just have instantly skippable cinematics when using the Replay Mission feature after having completed the story at least once. Watching the same cinematic however many times it takes you to do some of the challenges is just not fun :P\n\n- A.I. / StrikeForce Challenges\n\nThe A.I. (Artificial Intelligence) units for this game are not too bad for the main campaign, you probably wont have a problem with them. However the A.I. in the StrikeForce Missions are absoloutly terrible and make them almost unplayable. I have completed all 5 StrikeForce missions in the Tactical View only for the Challenge required for the Achievement, and occasionally the A.I. just dont move ever, they get stuck and they stand until they die.  Having said that, the StrikeForce missions i have done in Tactical View were pretty straightforward and i did the challenge first time.\n\nThe mission 'Shpwrecked' even on Recruit difficulty seems to be impossible to do due to A.I. not doing anything at all, or dying almost instantly to enemy soldiers or ASD's. They don't attack enemies en route to waypoints, they just run straight past them, so they die.  You do seem to have to really work to get them to kill things and defend properly in this one mission.\n\nI have completed this mission with very little difficulty having finally gotten around to it, at the time i completed it, i had quite a large force of soldiers, ASD's and a claw all fairly close to each other so they seemed to protect each other from dying so easily.  Once the Tactical View Challenge is done for all StrikeForce missions the rest of the challenges are a breeze.\n\nOne thing i will note to help others in completing challenges is that you do NOT need to successfully complete the mission so you can spend as long as you like 'running over soldiers with an ASD' for example until time runs out and you fail the mission if thats what it takes.\n\n\n\nBlack Ops 2 - Multiplayer\n\nHaven't really played this enough to review just yet - W.I.P\n\nAchievements - There are only 5 achievements for this part of the game, they appear to be very straightforward and one should not have a problem getting all of the achievements with probably less than 30 hours played. Assuming you physically try to get them as you do have to play in certain playlists to get 3 of them.  The other two being reach level 10 and reaching Prestige for the 1st time.\n\n\n\nBlack Ops 2 - Zombies\n\nHaven't really played this enough to review just yet - W.I.P\n\nAchievements - The Achievements for this part of the game if you want all of them DO REQUIRE ALL DLC, otherwise you can only get about 1/4 of them. I personally have not really played the zombies mode much but having being part of the zombies community and having seen alot of Livestreams of these base maps and DLC maps i would probably recommend the DLC if you enjoy the zombies mode.","February 16, 2015","true","63.3"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/WombatWithWings/recommended/202970/","WombatWithWings","WombatIstKrieg","http://steamcommunity.com/id/WombatWithWings/","584 products in account","There are some serious flaws with this game.\n\nFirst of which is that the campaign is boring. I never cared about a Call of Duty storyline since the second Modern Warfare and this one does not stand out.\n\nSecondly, the multiplayer is incredibly annoying, and if you are relatively good with shooters, that doesn't matter. I can (when i'm not hungover or stressed out) get top of the team in games like Counter-Strike, Battlefield, and even Day of Defeat, games that are considered more difficult than Black Ops 2. Skill from other games does not carry over to this one. The playing field is so leveled that you could call it a bottomless pit. Hell, someone with no experience concerning shooters can (after getting familiar with the ebb and flow of the controls and overall structure of the game) demolish people who actually have skill. With the utterly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ decision to include things like target finders, select fire, etc. anyone can pick this game up and do relatively good.\n\nFinally, zombies. Yes it is a "unique" gamemode. Yes I enjoy it. That doesn't mean you can say it fantastic or better than games like Left 4 Dead or Killing Floor; games that are head and shoulder over this overly repetive, luck-based and deathly annoying survival thing. When I care so little about a game (yes, for the sake of not trying to conjure synonyms for gamemode) that I don't even remember (or care to) prices for certain guns, perks, ♥♥♥♥, whatever, that should support the argument that this is boring. I want to like it, but when i've played games like Killing Floor or Left 4 Dead, Zombies in Black Ops seems petty and worth burying.\n\nSeems all negative eh? Well, just because I have problems with Black Ops 2, that doesn't mean I don't have fun. You see, the fun you can have with Call of Duty is mindless, stupid fun that does not require usage of more than a single brain cell. As long as you can turn off your brain, you can have fun with this. BUT, you must remember to turn it back on when you are done playing it - especially if you are discussing its merits or lack thereof.\n\n6/10\nRegardless, there is always the infinitely better Battlefield 3.\n\n*Disclaimer* I have only gone through a small amount of the singleplayer (I plan on actually finishing it eventually) so this is more about zombies and multiplayer - which is what you are mostly looking at when buying a CoD title after MW2.","June 4, 2013","false","0.6"," 34 of 62 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","34","62","0","3"

If you are looking for a good and time worthy Call of Duty to play and you're not into any recent Call of Duty titles, I can definitely recommend you picking up Call of Duty: Black Ops 2. Pretty much the last good COD along side COD MW 2...everything after those 2 games sucks beyond reason (as the reviews show).

The storyline's been done to death, and the only real objective here is shoot the people who don't have an American accent. I friendly fired more times than I could count, only because the damn game decided to show me their names AFTER I started firing. Not only that, but they didn't even have the decency to reprimand me for doing it!! Your character handles like a cardboard box in a gust of wind, and you're the wind. It made me carsick, which I have never felt before now. The graphics are also terrible. EVERYTHING IS F*CKING SHINY!! SKIN IS SHINY, RADIOES ARE SHINY. THE ONLY THING I FOUND THAT WASN'T SHINY IN THE ENTIRE CAMPAIGN WAS A SINGLE CLOTH MAP! Not to mention the weapons! They're either OP, or unable to hurt a fly depending on who holds them! A SMAW like weapon somehow could one-shot a tank, but when the enemy was handling them, it took two body shots, two body shots from the same thing to kill me. If being unrealistic was a crime, or even just being inconsistent, this game would have the death sentence. Ultimately, this game is flat out bad and boring. It brings nothing unique or interesting to the table, and you'd be better off playing war with tiny figurines.","September 19, 2015","false","18.3"," 24 of 43 people (56%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","56","24","43","11","7"

It includes only 3-4 maps originally, while the rest of them are DLCs, even though those 3-4 are pretty damn big, especially the bus one!! :P\nAs I said, zombies are dismemberable and also feature lots of gore, but as the rounds increase, zombies get tougher, and tougher, until it's just impossible to hold back.\nHope you found my review helpful, perhaps I didn't add lots of details, but feel free to ask me any questions by PMing me.\n","May 3, 2015","true","0.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Is it good? Yes, the changes and gameplay are amazing.Black Ops 2 has a great campaign mode writen by David Goyer who helped write the Dark Knight.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=309398019\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=309849061\nThe storyline is clever although not the standout if the game. The game sees even brighter light with the Multiplayer. It's as good as it's ever been and added some new designs for good measure. The zombie mode, seemed like a flop due to the dissaperence of the original characters, but, zombies changed to much it makes it all worth it. Tranzit is the highlight of zombies, showing off the new made "Greenrun" and a whole new direction for Call of Duty. This is as good as the original Black Ops which I can recommend this game easily.

What makes me say this is that all three branches of the game were very good in quality. The Campaign didn't feel rushed at all and had a great story to it that I couldn't stop playing. The Multiplayer felt really nice, faster paced gameplay and mostly balanced weapons made this game really enjoyable. The Zombies had the most maps of any Call of Duty game that I have ever seen, it was tons of fun slaying the undead in this game,\n\nPROS:\n-Balanced multiplayer (Mostly)\n-Good zombies mode\n-Excellent campaign\n-Good map design\n-Search and Destroy\n-Emblem editor\n-Veiwable combat record\n-SO MANY CALLING CARDS\n-Ranked playlist\n-Nukejacked playlist (18 players at a time on a really small map)\n\nCONS:\n-Hackers (this game has a few known hackers but most days it isn't an issue)\n-Low fan base. I wish more people played this game :(\n-Hunter killer drones (They kill you through buildings sometimes)\n\n\nFINAL VERDICT:\nOverall, this game is great. I've spent over 500 hours (even though it says I've only spent 9.3 hours) having fun pwning noobs. I would recommend this game to anybody who doesn't hate Call of Duty just because it's Call of Duty, this game is what got me back into Call of Duty after MW3.\n\nSCORE: 9.4/10","November 18, 2014","true","9.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

After seeing many videos and reviews of this game, I decided to get it.\n\nIf you're thinking of buying Ghosts you may want to re-consider that. Black Ops II is a much better game.\n\nThe game is split up into 3 sections. Campaign, Multiplayer, and Zombies all with seperate launchers.\n\nCampaign:\nThe Campaign doesn't really follow Black Ops's Story. The only comparisons of Black Ops and Black Ops II are the characters. The game is taken place in 2025 unlike in the 1960s like Black Ops. You must stop Raul Menendez from taking over the world in this futuristic type of gameplay.\n\nCampaign Grade: 9/10\n\nMultiplayer:\nThis has to be the best Multiplayer yet in a Call of Duty game.The guns are absolutely awesome, the maps are great, Nuketown from Black Ops returns, and the scorestreaks are great. If you wanted the M.O.A.B. from MW3 you may be disappointed. The M.O.A.B. is not in this game however that doesn't ruin the challenge of this game at all. The DLC is also great for this game too. Wager Matches return from Black Ops as Party Games. No more COD points needed to unlock guns. Just level up and get new guns. Everytime you prestige you unlock a Prestige Token. These allow you to unlock ANYTHING at anytime of the game. These Prestige Tokens can be used for unlocking guns at lower levels, unlocking perks at lower levels, or getting extra class slots. It's a great reward for prestiging wich is really good. Although some of the spawns are bad on some maps and there may not be as many people playing like there was before, Black Ops II multiplayer is such a fun experience.\n\nMultiplayer Grade: 9.8/10\n\nZombies:\nZombies may have to be the weakest part of the game unless you have the DLC. There's onlt 3 small survival maps. But there is two new very unique gamemodes to the Zombies experience. The gamemodes are TranZit and Grief. TranZit isn't really a Story Mode but more of like an Adventure mode. Finding parts to build shields and tools make TranZit awesome. You're not on a bus the whole time don't worry. You still have to run around and survive as long as you can. Grief mode is where two teams battle it out to survive. Basically saying, only one team survives. The DLC for Zombies is what makes it good. Getting the Season Pass is definitely worth getting if you want the best Zombie experience possible.\n\nZombie Grade: 8/10\n\nOverall Black Ops II is such a great game you don't want to miss out on. If the game ever goes on sale BUY IT.\n\nOVERALL RATING 9/10","December 22, 2013","true","7.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I just ignored the bad reviews of the game and started playing it. After around 200 hours i got it: The game itself isn't bad, but the communitiy is. If you play in a lobby with fair guys it makes fun, but that never happens. In each lobby i've been, there was a "pumpgunner", a sniper/quickscoper/noscoper or hard camper. It just ruins the atmosphere of the game, when there is somebody sitting in a Corner not moving the whole round. Also it's unrealistic, that you survive 20 bullets with an smg, but not a stab with the knife in your toe. The spawnsystem sucks either, you sometimes just spawn right behinde somebody. But the argument wich made me uninstall the game is: the ping. I have a good internet but sometimes i just die, even if i'm already behind he wall but because of the "lag compensation" it adds me a fake lag, so i get punished for my good internet?!? It was the first and the last call of duty i've ever bought. I reccomend to get titanfall, I hope it will be better :)\n\nI have 240h play time, not 2h.

That should really say it all. And I'm happy to say that it is still the difinitive worst COD game (at leats on pc) and possibly the worst shooter experiance I have ever seen. I loved COD 4, COD WaW and BO3 looks alright, but this game is just... well... let's just say it MADE a stereotype for shooters.\n\nFirst of all the singleplayer:\n\nTerrible. So unashamably distasteful and sickening that I am yet to finish the first mission. The only thing this game achieved is in showing me the horrors of shooting nameless, "unimportant" people as they run over the hill with a HMG. If that is the kind of "art" that rocks the worlds of 7 year olds nowadays, I'll leave them to it. I am very against the concept of videogames making people "violent". It's media ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that is used to make money. BUT, this campaign actually angered me. How is this ♥♥♥♥ even a story? BO1? Vietnam- a terrible war full of terrible things. BO2? IDK some dead people or something. The devs have the AUDACITY to try this. No. ♥♥♥ off.\n\nThe multiplayer:\n\nPossibly worse than the singleplayer. I'm a sucker for multiplayer games. But after one match of this I went to more saner fields. The community is like a living breathing meme, and not a funny one. They just incessantly screwed with my head so much that I had to take aspirin. Don't even get me started on the gameplay. The mouse movement is just appaling, and that may be my client only but the fact that it still hasn't been addresed is shocking. There is no balance whatsoever, and no learing curve to the gunplay. I mastered it in four minutes (recoil, what recoil?), after I got g00d and learned that all you have to do is click on people, and they fall over. Oh, wait no he hasn't. I've been kicked for no reason. Oh, wait, hes spamming shock charges. NOPE, no kill for you, KSG long barel Treyarchplz. There is no replayability either. Point and click. Fun. Things, explosive spam, excitement. 10/10 IGN. Unless you like repeating the same (short) unlock tree 10 times, the progression has nothing for you either.\n\nThe Zombies:\n\nThe best part of the game. If you've played zombies, I dont have to explain to you why it is good. If you haven't, try it out. I am yet to meet a person who dislikes it. It isn't the best zombies, but it's still worth buying. If I could rate this alone, THIS would be positive. I LOVE zombies, but nothing makes up for the rest of this game.\n\nSummary: Unless you like zombies, or shooting black people because plot, or ragy spammy little mingebag kids who are bunking of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ school to boost their m8ts and yell with crackly-♥♥♥ microphones when the die, don't buy this game.","August 1, 2015","false","0.5"," 25 of 46 people (54%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","54","25","46","7","0"

In other words its 3 laned for every map and it creates no diversity from game to game. I have enough hours on this game to say that there are no unique memorable nights of this game of playing the objective, but only for lame trickshots and trollers. All of this is how it is because the maps are all the same so you tell the same people to do the same thing every time the game starts and it makes nothing different. It bothers me how people complain about camping in this when it is hard to do. I've counted and found 1 or 2 rooms in the whole multiplayer map base where there were only 1 entrance to the building. There's always a way around and a flank to it. There are no hidden ledges or any secret spots to visit, all tables and chairs are blocked off and you can't even jump on top of them. Purely locked down.\n\n*SINGLE PLAYER*\nI personally admired the story portion where you go back in time to black ops 1 viet nam era to get woods. I like that factor of it but the modern age was just kinda dissapointing and I don't know how to put that into words.\n\n*ZOMBIES*\nThe characters for zombies for the first few maps that replaced the old group made my cringe level rise higher then americas debt. On a soccer mom scale, I don't even find the characters satisfying. The whole tranzit bus story thing bothered me because I thought there was more to it. I got more rage from flying monkeys on me then fun slaying zombies. Die Rise the map focused on a skyscraper was buggy and was too confusing, the zombies maps have become too much of a single mission to get to one place versus surviving. They improved upon this with Alcatraz, this map didn't disapoint me, but didn't satisfy me. The ability to die and have a chance to revive yourself is basically a big F*** you to the survival aspect and creates anger for me personally. Buried was a little better, it had more of the black ops 1 stay in one area and camp feeling and it was way less confusing to get to know. The hidden song and the whole map itself I really enjoyed playing and some nostaliga of it was generated. The final created map was great, Origins. It brought back the old group back in the earlier times which I really enjoyed, the open world of this map was a pure plus in my opinion, It succeded at having a plot and a goal to it but not confusing the hell out many people. The goals in this map did not have to be succeded to have fun and play, and many avaliable spots for training. They also made me get reminded of the world at war feeling.\n\n\n6/10 Wouldn't hijacked again.","June 19, 2015","false","11.0"," 16 of 29 people (55%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","55","16","29","3","1"

Black Ops 2 is in my opinion the BEST Call of Duty to date. Treyarch stepped away from the usual Call of Duty formula and set out to try many new approaches in this game and in my opinion have successfully made each approach awesome.\n\nThe new engine that Black Ops 2 runs on is just Gorgeous!!!The overall graphical fidelity and the colour pallet are so beautiful. It's the best graphical experience in CoD history. The capability of the game running so well on lower end graphics cards just amazes me.\n\nThe fact that you change between 2025 and the Cold War in the campaign gives you such an amazing blend of old and new and makes you feel like you are in Black Ops 1 for some moments. The Campaign has lets u make vital choices which change the course of the game. There are 6 different endings, a first for the Call of Duty franchise.\n\nThe Zombie mode is the best it's ever been, especially with the dynamic map Tranzit. The concept of having to complete objectives in Zombies is just spectacular as it complicates the gameplay positively and allows you to think about about which player should do whuch objective.\n\nThe Multiplayer is THE BEST Call of Duty Multiplayer experience you can have! A wide variety of amazing weapons and gadgets, Beautiful and well designed maps (including a modern remake of Nuketown) and ease of use match joining system is fantastic!

Black ops 2 changed up the Black Ops a good deal, having the campaign set in two different time periods and featuring custom loadouts in campaign was something I had not expected when I first got Black Ops 2 on the Xbox.  Overall the biggest change probably has to be zombies. Zombies received a pretty big overhaul in Black Ops 2, I cant really say that I like it more or less than the older games.\n\nOverall I have got to say I am looking forward to seeing what they do with Black Ops 3, so here's to the future yea?","May 28, 2015","true","4.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This SP has some variety to it making it unique ot the COD games. This game allows you to switch your loadout, before the mission starts.\nMultiplayer is complete gamble. The game is based off your connection and luck.\nOh and Lag comp. The only plus is that the game runs on Dedicated servers.\nZombies was made MUCH easier and lacks the challenge the old zombie games brought.\nThe zombie maps are just 1(without DLC) and its really lacking as the only map gets really boring quick.","July 16, 2013","true","20.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
