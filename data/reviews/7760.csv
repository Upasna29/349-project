Many civilians became chryssalids within hours, and upon the arrival of X-squad 3, the city was overrun. The Dujardin Brothers were the first out of their Skyranger and began their mission with fervor. Captian Leonid Torban, their comanding officer, was very fond of the two, "Bernard could hit a muton from 15 tiles away and never miss! Henri, well, I guess he was good with grenades? He was the only one to not kill his own squadmates with explosives".\n\nSoon, however, the two were separated from the rest of their squad due to a cyberdisk pinning them in a small building. Nearby chryssalids soon took advantage of the situation. The brothers made a final, valiant last stand inside the house. Henri set up multiple explosive traps at the entrances to the building and Bernard provided covering fire from the second floor. It seemed the Dujardins would make it, until one fatal mistake.\n\nThe cyberdisk was destroyed by fellow squadmates, but it exploded, causing a breach in the walls of their stronghold. A loan chryssalid was able to move into the building undetected, and while Henri had his back turned, the chryssalid impregnated Henri. He became a shambling form of his former self, his mind devoured by the chyrssalid's poison. Bernard, sensing this was his final turn, chose to sacrific himself for his team. He placed a number of high explosives inside the room he was baricaded in.\n\nThe only remainder of that building was a single 1x1 wall. Bernard had managed to eliminate 5 chryssalids as well as his former turned brother. Unfortunately, there was no body to recover. Berlin was saved, but at a high cost. Hundreds of civilians lost, 5 agents lay dead, and one turned in to an alien. The victory was sour.\n\nBernard was promoted to the rank of captian and Henri to sergent upon their team's return to their HQ somewhere in the apparently unimportant part of Europe.\n\nIn the end, that 1x1 wall was made into a memorial, the Dujardin Memorial. It lists all of the fallen agents of the campagin, with Henri's and Bernard's names at the top.\n\nA new warcry has been established by the agents of Xcom: Remember Berlin!\n\n10/10 would relive again","October 11, 2014","true","21.8"," 407 of 415 people (98%) found this review helpful 128 people found this review funny","98","407","415","128","13"

I respond with "X-Com, with the - in it" and they often get confused with the modern XCOM, but I further clarify with "The one from 1993". Which is normally the point where they pretend to look at their watch, make an excuse and walk out of the room.\n\nSo why in 2015 is my favourite game still this? Well firstly, I'm going to outline what makes this game so special. And then to wrap it up, I'll tell you how you can enjoy it in the modern world. Because for me this game is still my personal favourite.\n\nX-Com puts you firmly on the back foot from the very start. Aliens have invaded and it's your job to mount Earth's final defense against the Alien foe before we are all killed or enslaved or something happens (the intention of the invasion isn't clear to begin with). What you spend most of the game doing, is trying to shoot down enemy UFO's with your rubbish fighter jets, and then trying to fight the Alien's at the UFO crash site with your poorly equipped troops.\n\nI use terms like "rubbish" and "poorly equipped" because you are fighting Aliens here. Not Germans, not Japanese, not another nation - but mother-♥♥♥♥ing ALIENS. These guys have better weapons than you, better vision than you and more resources than you. They flew across the galaxy to fight us, and the only thing you can do at the start of the game is fight them off with humanities best and brightest, which just isn't enough.\n\nThis means that your troops will die. A lot. And it's mean, and it's unfair and the game is obviously hard because of that. But at great cost of life, humanity is able to claw it's way back and slowly put up more of a fair fight. As you recover Alien technology from your encounters, and spend time researching it, the X-Com scientists are then able to reverse engineer the technology into better equipment. This can be armour that can survive a few shots, or better weapons, or ground and air vehicles. Slowly but surely, humanity is able to avoid extinction.\n\nYou are fighting for the very survival of the human race, and that's not meant to be easy. Fortunately the game equips you with the systems you need to be successful but it's on YOU to work out how to do it. This is a game where you might have to watch some tutorial videos on YouTube or read the manual[cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com]. And if you do these things, you will be rewarded with one of the deepest and enjoyable single player experiences that you can have.\n\nSo if you read this and you're willing to invest a bit of time to enjoy the game. After all, it is only £3! I recommend you use OpenXcom[openxcom.org] to play the game. You won't be able to launch the game through Steam, but it gives you much better performance on modern systems than playing the original game through DOSBox. The alternative is that you check out Xenonauts which is a faithful recreation of X-Com using an updated UI, better graphics and a bit more automation (such as not having to order ammunition and things). I know it sounds a bit odd, but Xenonauts is so faithful to X-Com that if you don't think you can cope with how dated this game is, I would encourage you to treat this as a review for Xenonauts. Other than very minor tweaks, and a change to air combat, they are essentially the same game.","March 31, 2015","true","5.0"," 267 of 281 people (95%) found this review helpful 27 people found this review funny","95","267","281","27","8"

The original (1994) was super buggy and nearly unplayable on newer systems, but thanks to these guys (the people working on the openxcom project) the game is now playable and with lots of bug fixes.\n\nThe game is pretty unbalanced and exploitable, here are a few tips:\n\n-  Don't exit the craft in the first turn as the aliens, that have visual on you, will have full AP and will likely reaction fire.\n-  Always have the maximum number of soldiers in the landing craft (while this might be obvious, I saw people that don't do this, usually the same kind of people that spend all the APs exploring instead of having some AP for reaction fire or retreat).\n- Put the most expandable soldiers closer to the exit of the landing craft because the first ones out are the likeliest to get killed.\n- Don't hurry, especially getting your troops out of the landing craft.\n- Advance slowly, only extend yourself when you have an alien’s location and you can kill it because you don't want it to have a full turn while you are in sight. Expanding on this, try to kill all the aliens that you see in the same turn that you see them; that's why it's usually best to advance slowly (to have lots of APs) and have lots of soldiers (and implicitly firepower).\n- You should use scouts (~rookies) that at the start of the turn will try to advance but also retreat at the end. This way you'll create a buffer and decrease the chance of enemies sneaking close enough to the rest of your (more valuable) soldiers.\n- Exploit: After turn 20 the aliens are generally going to come and try to find you, useful for landed/crashed UFOs.\n- A very good starting location is in west Lebanon so that you will have cover over Europe and a lot of the downed UFOs could be in North Africa where the desert maps are pretty smooth.\n- The beginning (or better said the first half of the game) is going to be pretty brutal, use all the force that you can and don't shy away from explosives and leveling buildings even preemptively in some cases.\n\n\nPros: great feeling, nice combination of tactical game, researching stuff and base building while under pressure to survive.\nCons: exploitable, unbalanced, bad spotting/FOV mechanic, you see as much as the aliens only in full light which will lead to a lot of frustration.\nRating: now, we are prodding *them*!\nRecommendation: only if you are into this kind of games and you can tolerate/like the graphics.\n\nhttp://pixelloot.com","August 17, 2015","true","2.4"," 149 of 162 people (92%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","92","149","162","4","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/brendissimo/recommended/7760/","brendissimo","Brendissimo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/brendissimo/","277 products in account","Originally posted on November 11, 2010\n\nI've been occupied by XCOM for the past two weeks straight, and it's been a blast. XCOM: UFO Defense is simply one of the best games ever made.\n\nThe gameplay is deep, addictive and atmospheric, and does a surprising amount for a game from 1994. Your task as leader of the newly formed project for the defense of earth from aliens is to stop alien raids and abductions by shooting down their ships, ambushing their landing parties, and destroying their bases. Eventually you are tasked with taking the fight to the aliens and defeating them altogether. There are two modes of gameplay, the Geoscape and the Battlescape.\n\nIn the Geoscape (real time, variable time speeds), you build bases around the world, dispatch interceptors and dropships to deal with UFOs, do research, manufacture and purchase weapons and vehicles, and try to please all your sponsor nations so they don't reduce their funding. However, it quickly becomes apparent that both human technology and the funding from sponsor nations are both completely inadequate for the task. In order to survive and stop the aliens, you need to capture alien technology, research it, and produce your own copies, and then sell the excess loot for mounds of money.\n\nThe Battlescape on the other hand (turn based tactical, top down) allows you to control your squad of soldiers (who improve over time in surprisingly sophisticated ways) in attempts to stop the aliens. But don't think it will be easy. The Battlescape is an unforgiving world filled with aliens waiting to snipe at your men from distant cornfields and ambush you from around corners. The first several missions you play, it is likely that you will fail spectacularly. This is entirely intentional, and really contributes to the atmosphere of the game. You really feel like you are learning on the job, facing a totally unknown and technologically superior enemy who holds all the cards. A genuine feeling of satisfaction accompanies finally being able to defeat the aliens in a mission (albeit with heavy losses), or re-engineering your first bit of alien weapon tech. The lack of a tutorial actually helps the game in this way, as it is much deeper than it first appears, and it feels very authentic to learn the ropes of the game in this way.\n\nThe graphics and sound are marvelously retro, and might take some getting used to for some of the less open-minded gamers out there, but I assure you the reward is worth it. Overall, this is a game that you MUST play if you call yourself a PC gamer at all. It joins a myriad of other gems from the 90's that modern gamers are continually ignorant of, though they inform modern developers every single day. There is no better indication of the current stagnation of game development than playing a game like XCOM and seeing how incredible it is. This game with an extreme facelift would be strategy GOTY.","December 31, 2013","true","58.7"," 64 of 67 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","64","67","0","0"

So one CAN accuse me of a nostalgia bomb.    But I am  not reviewing X-com UFO defense from my memory of playing it 15 or so years ago, I am reviewing based on recent play throughs.   And it still has all the charm that it had from the start.\n\nFull Disclosure 2:  I played the Vanilla steam version for a while, then noticed comments on something calld OpenXCom.   (easily found on the net).    It's a free, extensive overhaul with many mod choices built in.   Very easy to set up; you do need to have a vaniilla version (steam version works for me...no disc required, and it is pretty cheap).    Some of the many choices are PSI on/off; improved H. Lasers,  choices for setting up your first base rather than accepting the default, and so on.   Highly recommended.\n\nOk, the actual review.    It is one of my favorite games of all time (not judging it in its release time frame, but CURRENTLY).      The graphics are last century, iti is true.   But the gameplay is +++++.     It is tough; there is a lot to figure out, and things never seem to happen in an orderly fashion.   Sometimes you just have to give up a mission;  sometimes you just have to give up a game.    The aliens like to win, LoL.   It's a lot of fun to grind through a mission successfully, but there are no guarantees.\n\nOne of my criteria for a top notch game is whether it provides not only fun, dangerous stuff to do throughout, but once in a while something unexpected happens that blows me away.   Like  when I found out if I through a grenade on a roof, that it could bounce, and if it bounced into an alley it would fall to the ground, and if there was  a hidden alien there you would hear a muffled explosion and then....the alien death cry  you hardly expected.    First time that happened I had to save and quit for a while...I was laughing too hard.\n\nIf you like challenges, tactics, and turn-based games, this is a must try out.   Good luck, andI I hope you can stop those monsters!\n","October 15, 2014","true","16.7"," 43 of 45 people (96%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","96","43","45","2","0"

To clear up some easy confusing this about the original X-COM, not X-COM Enemy Unknown that for some bizarre reason is marketed as UFO Defense in the USA.\n\nUFO Defense was a bona fide classic even back when it was released. You play the role as the supreme commander of earth or some such and must build bases, train troops and research technology as you try to stem the tide of invading aliens. Most of the management aspects take place in a pseudo real-time interface where you look down on the Earth and pick where to build what, which soldiers to send where and so forth. Once you've shot down a UFO or simple found one that's already landed however the game switches down to a Turn-Based tactical map where you must find and eliminate every alien you see. Different elevations, as well as the ability to remove cover and peak into buildings by using explosives keep the game challenging.\n\nAs you progress through the game a bit of storyline unfolds as the aliens ramp up their invasion of earth and you are through a series of events lead towards the opportunity to stop it once and for all.\n\nUFO Defense is a classic game that should be played by any fans of strategic/tactical games. It might not have held very well with age but it's still one of the best games in it's genre.","January 1, 2013","true","112.3"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","15","16","0","0"

It takes time to get used to it.\nOther than that - it is the best must-play turn-based strategy, in my opinion.\n\nLike in new XCOM, there are two parts - turn-based combat and economical simulator on global map.\nIn the global part you set up the base (up to 6), build all kind of facilities, in order to research, copy, manufacter and then sell alien technology-based staff, thus making yourself financially self-sufficient. Build lots of storage rooms and collect prescious ellerium. Lots of ellerium. Also, there you hire soldiers, screen off weak, and manualy customize the strong ones. Make up capable squad.\n\nYou have a lot of freedom in the global part to make a separate game from it , however the real kicker of the game is the squad combat part.\nIf you are new to a game aliens will often beat you up on easy difficulty. And it hurts. After 100 h X-COM becomes something like chess. You start using exploits like it was designed to do so. There you can master superhuman difficulty.\nAfter 200h of playing and reading a lot of material from X-COM wiki you can easily kick chrissalid terror mission's butt during the night on superhuman using only conventional weapons. And even then, when you feel super confident, sometimes, soldiers, you became so attached to, you trained so well, all die, due to grenade relay malfunctioning. In one big kaboom.

First and foremost, this is one of the best games ever made. It has been over 20 years since this game was originally released and it is still every bit as good now as it was back then. Not even Enemy Unknown (Expect a lot of comparisons by the way) can quite match up to how enthralling this game is.\n\nSo let's get some problems out of the way first; As much as I wish XCOM: Enemy Unknown would let you have more than a maximum of 6 soldiers in a mission at once, this game goes completely ♥♥♥♥ing overboard with it. At first it's not too bad, letting you initially field 14 soldiers a mission at once. It gives you a generous amount of troops without it being too unwieldy. However late game once you get the final transport you can field 26 soldiers a mission. This not only makes soldiers feel a little too expendable (Which can lead to some pretty hilarious things to happen when your higher ranking officers are in trouble) it also makes some battles incredibly laborious especially when you're unloading your troops from the transport. Then there is the user interface which will be completely baffling for new players. Seriously, it can take a while to actually get used to it. If you can get past it, though, then I guarantee you will fall in love with this game.\n\nOkay now that that is out of the way; The actual strategic battles that take place are perfect. Fully destructable environments combined with every weapon being able to freely target any tile adds countless strategic value and can make or break any situation. Then there is the time units system. As great as the two move system in Enemy Unknown is, it doesn't exactly work as well as the time unit system in UFO Defense. Let me explain: Time units act as a kind of currency given to each unit on the field in order to perform any action be it moving, crouching, shooting, or looting. Oh yeah, that's another thing that's better about this game, you can loot dead enemies as well as fallen XCOM soldiers. This is a really good feature that allows you to have tiny victories by letting you take some alien artifacts or carcasses even when the aliens have almost completely annihilated your forces. Then there is also the game's night missions. Unlike in Enemy Unknown, depending on where the battlefield is taking place, night missions can be legitimately creepy and frustratingly difficult early game. It helps to build this really tense atmosphere that even in late game still retains a little bit of its magic, and it's only amplified if there's a chryssalid lurking around.\n\nOkay now let's move on to the Geoscape... well there is a lot more micro management in this part than both the Battlescape and Enemy Uknown combined. I personally like it; it makes me feel more like I'm running a military base with all the little things that ultimately don't add much value to the overall game, but are pretty nice to have anyway. However I will always always ALWAYS prefer this Geoscape over Enemy Unknown's Geoscape. Why? Because this Geoscape actually let's you be proactive by letting you patrol your interceptors over areas that seem to have a lot of UFO activity instead of that god awful satelite mechanic in Enemy Unkown (which I will explain in more detail why it is bad in my review of Enemy Unknown once I finish the game.) The interceptor battles themselves don't have much more depth in this game, but they go by so fast it's not a glaring issue. Also, deploying your troops to deal with aliens doesn't run as much of a risk of losing a country's support as it does in Enemy Unknown, and as a result makes the aftermath of the council report much less annoying.\n\nThere are some things that I haven't addressed about this game in this review, but it's already long enough and I feel I've covered all the important stuff... Even if this turned into an old XCOM vs new XCOM, but after playing both games a lot it's really hard for me not to compare them. It's still amazing how well this game has aged over a couple decades as opposed to others, and I still stand by what I said in the first paragraph that XCOM: UFO Defense is one of the greatest games of all time.\n10/10 (Because I can't refrain myself from giving games I review a score)","February 14, 2013","true","49.2"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

That right off the bat should tell you that there's something special about this game if people are trying to recreate it ~20 years after it came out. That there's something here that people just can't let go of.\n\nTurns out it's the truth. The UI is extremely archaic, the graphics speak for themselves, and the game lacks many of those "modern improvements" like autosave and such. With that said, this game was vastly ahead of its time. And its still good despite its age. It's very similar to Enemy Unknown in many respects (aliens invade, shoot their UFO's down, stop terror attacks, eventually eliminate the alien leader, etc), but there's alot that didn't get to that game as well. Multiple bases, no class system, larger battles in general (the top level air transport allows you to bring something in the order of ~26 troops into a fight), assaults on your bases if you don't chase aliens away from them, and more. It's harder than EU, longer than EU (took me close to 50 hours to beat this opposed to 20-30 for EU), and in some ways is a larger game as well.\n\nIt's still a great game, though some might be turned off by how it looks. But if you can give it a shot, you can very well find a game that, even if it is one of the oldest games on Steam, is still an excellent mix of fun, challenge, and replayability.\n\nJust watch out for the Chryssalids.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/recommended/7760/","atratzu","Atratzu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/","180 products in account","-Quick Review-\nX-COM: UFO Defense is a strategy game developed by MicroProse Software Inc. in 1993, at the time the game was revolutionary, and is commonly cited as one of the first strategy games many people played, the game is extremely difficult, especially if you've never played it before or any other X-COM games.\n\n-Detailed breakdown review-\nStory:  I would love to give more details about the story... but, I haven't progressed very far into the game, so all that I can say regarding the story, is probably what you already know; "X-COM is a project that is supported by various nations to defend the Earth from Alien Invasion".\nYou will have a great degree of control over the location your base will be constructed, buildings inside your base, troops, scientists, engineers, aircraft, and weapons for your troops or aircraft. Being a strategy game lover, the only way I can describe the detail put into this game from the 90's is "beautiful". ...I just wish I was better at playing it.\n\nGame Play: As I eluded too earlier in my review, there's a lot of customization available in the game, generally starting out most people have the same strategy, and if you intend to pick up this game, I highly recommend checking out guides online, or steam guides. You will most likely need them.\nIt should be noted that the fan base for X-COM have put out updates for the game, I never took the time to look into any of them, but they supposedly make the game much easier to play. I just decided I will work with what steam game me. (something with the DOS Box, updating DOS box, or downloading a whole new client, etc. If you want to know more, Google or go to X-COM: UFO Defense forums)\nFor people in the unique situation where they HAVE played X-COM: Enemy Unknown, there are a remarkable similarities in game functions, and strategies. I was able to figure out most of the beginning Base, overview, scientists, and engineering controls and tasks, without needing to look up anything online...\n...It was the battle phases that lost me, I spent 2+ hours of my time learning how much fun it was to get murdered by aliens, (mind you: I'm playing on easy difficulty, I thought I could take a few shots to the face... nope, just nope. Just one *zap* and you're toasted-carbon-molecules.)\n\nAchievements: Beating this game, or getting far into the game is an achievement. It's called "being good at old/classic video games" and I wish I was, I really do. But these games help remind me that even though I succeed in most video games and get achievements for jumping off cliffs and dying, that I really have achieved nothing. Regarding steam achievement... Nope,  nada, and that's just fine with me!\n\nPrice:  X-COM: UFO Defense is $4.99, a package deal getting you five classic X-COM games goes for $14.99 (best deal, if you know you like these games). I personally bought this game from a Humblebundle.\n\nConclusion: Here's the real question: "Will you enjoy this game?" and the answer is... probably not.\nBut this is someone's childhood, just like Commander Keen is mine, therefore I cannot cast my vote to "not recommended", this game is really amazing that it was from 1993, and it started the ball rolling for an outstanding strategy game series that helped shape strategy games today.","April 13, 2015","true","10.8"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","78","7","9","2","0"

After you've scrambled some jets and nailed those suckers, a "mission" becomes available. The mission consists simply of sending out your forces to the crashsite where you have to eliminate survivors in turn-based combat.\nDuring the game your forces will become stronger and with the help of research, new and better equipment will be available for production. This will come in handy, seeing as the aliens also become stronger and more resillient as the game progress. I find that the difficulty curve is quite nice, up to a point when the most powerfull weapons become available, after that the game becomes a little trivial. Still, this does not happen untill late in the game, and that's more than a couple of hours of gameplay.\nThe turnbased combat I find very entertaining. There is a load of different aliens with different abilities, all of whom are dedicated to kill your elite soldier squad. Some will make you moan in annoyance, as they take control of your soldiers, and others scream in terror as they charge forward and impregnate your soldiers turning them into "zombies". Atleast that's what I did when I first played this game as a very young little boy.\nThe graphics and sound in the game is well, old, but many a great game survives purely on gameplay, and this is one of those games. The graphics are probably the games biggest weakness, but also one of it's charms I think. This is an old school game, for old school gamers, specificly for the type that likes turnbased combat with a mix of basebuilding. So take a trip down memory lane and give this little gem a chance - also make sure to get help on the boards on setting up the game...","December 20, 2014","true","19.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

This is a game where being OCD can usually pay off.\n\nFeaturing a massive tech tree for both the aircraft to shoot down UFOs, and for your ground forces to have better weapons and armor to defeat whatever aliens may actually make it to the ground, not to mention the amount of detail put into the game's research entries, the game has a sound amount of content.\n\nThe actual combat is solid, featuring mostly destructable terrain, and a lot of gratification for successful operations, and plenty of chaos for a turn-based game.  It's detailed enough for a strategy-game fan to get immersed in, if he/she so wished.\n\nAll in all, it's an often-overlooked gem that I believe everyone should play at least once.","July 3, 2011","true","17.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","2"

This game can be rage-inducing  But man if this game isn't fun...\n\nThis game is just another one of those games that comes right out of my childhood. I remember when the first laptops where open to sell to the public and the military had given a free laptop with training on their use (wow right?). My dad got a Compaq Presario, which I still have, This game was on there along with Colonization, Civilization 1-3, and Warcraft.\n\nHowever this game holds a special place in my heart, I was terrified of this game as a child and would  have thought of it as a horror game. But I digress, this game is what the latest game XCOM: Enemy Unknown is based on. This game is insanely hard even though the difficulty setting is a myth. Now mind you this game is old so graphics are not 2016 quality but, that being said this game still charming in a soul crushing way. You can set up every mission with 14 soldiers and you should expect a 50% mortality rate being a good mission resolution. Now on the plus side you can have multiple bases all over the world and set them up how you want. Research is slow and the aliens have a clear and painfuly humbling advantage to you even when you develop laser weapons which are one of the first research option. Which is a testament to its difficulty. Terror mission are the last thing you want to see on your map, and the best solution for the alien menace is to chase them down over the ocean and then shoot them down so as to hopefuly delay the inevitable beating you will recieve by the aliens long enough to get tech that it won't be a massacare. The only forgiving feature is that you don't loose council members and just a small portion of funding which can be suplimented by selling things you make.\nInspite of its age with clunky controls and sometimes absurd difficulty I recomment this game. It is affordable and its sequal, X-COM: Terror From the Deep is even crazier than this game. If you are a glutton for punishment and want a challenge and enjoyed the updated version. I would highly recommend that you get this game","January 20","true","26.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

One of the best decisions I've ever made.\n\nWhile the graphics are incredibly dated, but for being 20 years old (and counting) aren't bad at all. I highly recommend finding the Open Xcom mod after downloading, it updates the UI and makes the game playable by modern standards and fixes many, many bugs (and is the only way I play the game). The formula made familiar by the new game is if anything stronger and more sandbox-y as you get complete control over your base layout, your teams are 14 instead of 7 and there are a lot more events and pressures than the new one. It is also much harder, but as a result more rewarding when you beat it.\n\nThe only real negative is the lack of a strong cover system (it's fine, but not the awesome system from Enemy Unknown).\n\n\nScore: 9/10","August 22, 2014","true","4.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

In combat you play in turns, all other actions out of combat like base management are simply interface choices at paused global time.\n\nStarting up, you have an underground base with some basic few equipment and personell. You job is to deal with alien threat on earth. To do that you need to intercept UFOs with you planes when you detect them so you crash them and then land and explore with your squad. Also you need to react to other alien activities already on ground like city attacks. At the end, you squad lands near the incident, kills alien opposition and accomplishes the goals. But kill the alien opposition is not exactly easy. The second part is about three main activities. Research on alien equipment, dead and alive aliens and theories will give you knowledge for better combat effectiveness, stronger bases and progress your investigation on aliens and to understand your enemy plan - the initial title was UFO Enemy uknown. The second is manufacturing, usually based on alien findings after researching. You can manufacture weapons, armor and gadgets for your combat squad, plane fighters and their weapons for stronger interceptions, better squad carrier crafts, base facilities and defences and other. The third thing is about your bases. You start with one but you can build 8 total.\n\nThe magic about X-COM is that you can do anything that later X-COM or X-COM like games restrict and present them as new revolutionary gameplay elements. But for X-COM veterans those were just restrictions. You can have a fully custom squad, from 1 man show to 32 total soldiers, replacing 4 with a mechanical small tank if you like, or two or as many tanks as you like, soldiers equipped with whatever gear from a large variaty of existing and later researched and manufactured options. You can complete a mission with dozens of real different tactics. You can expand your bases any way you like. You can build a 'research' base, or a 'factory' base or an 'interception' base or a 'military' base as i call them. Or just all your bases can be all-around.\n\nAs a matter of fact, any style you want to play is doable. And every choice has effect. A tank unit for example is definatetly stronger than a soldier at start but it does not gain any experience. Soldiers improve mostly after they kill aliens. On the other hand, if you have the transportation space you may get a tank with you to salvage the situation if all goes ill. Or just do not use tanks - i do not for example. They are not overpowered or anything, but i do not like them, i prefer soldiers.","June 12, 2015","true","5.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Of course, the bad news is that the aliens equipment is extreamly more advanced than what you can field in the beginning so its up to you to even the odds. Gameplay takes place in two screens, the Geocape which is where you manage your bases, conduct research, launch missions, and monitor alien activity across the globe.\nThe second screen is the Battlescape. This is where you take the fight to the aliens.\nGameplay here is turn based as you move your troops around the battlefield trying to kill aliens before they shoot your troops in the face with a plasma bolt.\nYou will shake your fists in anger as your rookie trooper fails to shoot a sectoid that is right in front of him. You will morn the death of your favorite veteran soldier when they die heroically in the line of duty, you will smile with glee when you finish building a shiney new weapon that you reverse engineered from alien tech and prepare to use it against the alien menace, and you will shreik in terror when you experiance a snakeman terror mission for the first time.\n\nThis game maybe old, but it is a must play for any fan of strategy games out there.\n\n(Recently, OpenXcom was released which adds a whole bunch of features (including mod support) and bug fixes that is a must have if you play this game.

The fact that this game is from 1993 is immediately apparent from the outdated graphics and UI. With no instructions, I failed my first mission. I promptly learned from my mistakes. The game is difficult, but fair, and even the glitches affect your enemies as well as you. The first levels are difficult if you have not read instructions, and it is only marginally easier after you know what to do. After a certain point, you feel like you aren't losing, but you never feel like you're winning. Not until the credits roll.The difficulty of the game makes it more rewarding than any recent games, despite what was expected from The lack of plot and the (really outdated) graphics. If you want to fix those problems, you can play X-COM: Enemy Unknown. It is an extremely simplified version that lacks most of the depth, but is still good when taken on its own.","March 20, 2014","true","52.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

YOU ♥♥♥♥ING ALIEN ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥! ♥♥♥♥!" Then you buy more soldiers and name them something like "Niall Reborn" or "Jesus Christ".\nThis game may be old as ♥♥♥♥ but it is still very playable and addictive.

Any of these Mods speeds the game up and patches near enough everything.\n\nX-COM UFO Defense is a type of game I don't normally play but holy ♥♥♥♥ is it fun when you get in to it. It is extremely rewarding when you win your first encounter or research new weapons and tech. and it's all topped with a beautiful hard as ♥♥♥♥ difficulty.\nI highly recommend this masterpiece of a game.

If I had to sum up the game in 3 words I'd have to say brutal, rewarding and erm...old which brings me to my first point. Due to its age it definitely may not be everyones cup of tea. If you can see past the age related interface niggles there is a truly deep strategic experience to be had here.\n\nTruth be told I've had issues running this game for years and years but with a little reading I was always able to get it playable. There was absolutely zero tinkering needed with the Steam release, it runs in a completely acceptable state on my Win7 64 machine :)\n\nThis game stole a year of my life and a year of my friends. While everybody was out enjoying the sun during the school holidays my friend and I were working on our vitamin D deficiency, huddled round a pc waging war on the Sectoid ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s and their slithering minions.\n\nThis is not an easy game. It can be absolutely rage inducing when the RNG gods mock you from above while your crack squad get minced during a terror attack. On the flip side, the feeling you get when you beat some of the things the game throws at you later in the game is intense. The suspense of what this brutal game will throw at you next is just perfect.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kentlang/recommended/7760/","kentlang","Protesting Guy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kentlang/","230 products in account","Said to be the best strategy game of all time. Not an understatement exactly. It's not as needlessly complex as most turn based strategy games. It's not as hectic as realtime strategy and it's not as shallow as most indie strategy out today. This is a really well balanced strategy game with destructable environments, funding, research, base maintenence and manufacturing. Very entertaining game and well worth the price.\n\nStory - What's it all about?\nX-COM starts on January, 1999. You are in charge of X-COM, an extraterrestrial defense force, funded by almost all of the major countries from back in the 90ies. Russia, Brazil, China, USA, India, South Africa, Libya, Egypt and all of the major european countries like France, Germany, UK and not some others like any Nordic ones or Netherlands, Austria. Probably because these countries wouldn't or couldn't fund a project such as an extraterrestrial defense force. Regardless, you are now supposed to cover the 'entire globe'. Well not entire, you will only have to cover the ones that do fund you and since many countries actually doesn't fund you, you can safely let aliens land in their areas. But if you're like me, you will probably want to go ahead and cover as much territory as possible anyway.\n\nGameplay - How does it play?\nYou are in charge of everything. You put up your base, you intercept and shoot down all of the UFOs, you lead your tactical squads on mission, conduct research and manufacture weapons. This game is amazing in all you can do and research is vitally important to you as it leads your progress throughout the game (like research bloody should!). At the start of the game you know nothing about these aliens and even as a player that kinda frightens you because these aliens, already from the absolute start of the game, they utilize far more superior weapons than your own. As the game progresses, the aliens don't really, but if you're able to stay in the game for long enough and have spent some fair amount of money in scientists you will realize that you can reverse engineer the alien technology and even construct even more superior weapons than them: GENIUS!\n\nCriticism - But what isn't that great?\nWell for instance, the aliens start out vastly superior to your people in every respect. This is not bad in of itself but it makes some of the future things you can construct somewhat redundant. For instance; you can construct armor for your soldiers eventually, but it doesn't protect well as the aliens fire incredibly damaging salvos of plasma matter at them which basically melts the armor instantly. Without the armor your soldiers only have 1 hit point as far as you're concerned but even with the armor they barely raise that to 2 hit points. Also, when one of your people dies; you cannot recover their armor. Which means that you must make a 20000 dollar armor for every individual you want to protect.\nMy other criticism with the game is that many of the expenses doesn't make much sense. For instance; you never buy interception planes. No you RENT them! What the earth? And when they get shot down (not if), you don't even have to pay anything. I think they could just as well have sold the interceptors instead, but seeing as it is the very first plane for a very long time I can see why they decides to make the planes that way. The funny thing is that the rent of bloody 600'000 dollars and you have to pay every month! I know it's state of the art but holy cow man. USA's funding is barely 700'000 - 800'000 and they expect you to have a base there plus at least one interceptor to keep all of the aliens at bay!?\nOf course I am nitpicking a little but that's what great with the game: It doesn't really have any flaws other than that. Sure the aliens are hard as balls to fight but that's the point of the game!\n\nConclusion - So what rating do you propose?\nI propose a rating of 6 out of 6. This game is bloody amazing strategy game. It's almost as if it was made for me. The amount of content in it is huge for a DOS game of barely 6 MB and even by today's standards it's incredibly fun to play.","January 17, 2012","true","87.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

If I had to sum up the game in 3 words I'd have to say brutal, rewarding and erm...old which brings me to my first point. Due to its age it definitely may not be everyones cup of tea. If you can see past the age related interface niggles there is a truly deep strategic experience to be had here.\n\nTruth be told I've had issues running this game for years and years but with a little reading I was always able to get it playable. There was absolutely zero tinkering needed with the Steam release, it runs in a completely acceptable state on my Win7 64 machine :)\n\nThis game stole a year of my life and a year of my friends. While everybody was out enjoying the sun during the school holidays my friend and I were working on our vitamin D deficiency, huddled round a pc waging war on the Sectoid ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s and their slithering minions.\n\nThis is not an easy game. It can be absolutely rage inducing when the RNG gods mock you from above while your crack squad get minced during a terror attack. On the flip side, the feeling you get when you beat some of the things the game throws at you later in the game is intense. The suspense of what this brutal game will throw at you next is just perfect. I loved it 23 years ago and I still love it now, while some things have not aged well the basic mechanics of the game remain as beautiful today as they were back then.\n\nA true classic in every sense of the word","February 3","true","0.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Keep in mind, that I am wrong in the review below!\n\n6.8 megabytes of fun.\nIt's pretty ruthless for beginners of the series, since you don't have a clue what to do, how to do anything (all the buttons in the fighting mode for example, no descritpion at all) and when to do something. When to buy another base, hangar and so on. This is my first X-COM game I have played in my whole life and it is a lot of fun. But to be honest? I would rather play the new XCOM game called "Enemy Unknown" if you are new to the series, since it features more modern visuals (duh) and is far easier to get into. X-COM: UFO DEFENSE though is not a watered down version is definetly more complex. You get to make more choices, but the downside of all that is its clunkyness. Those game mechanics are more than 20 years old, keep that in mind. I had no problems playing this game on Windows 10, so this is definetly not a worry you should have. My advice anyway: get OpenXcom. You get to play at higher resolutions and you are able to zoom out, which is pretty neat. The game was not meant to be played in 1080p on 27", so OpenXcom is a neat "alternative"...which is free of charge.\nSo, before you buy - try OpenXcom first. It's more or less the same game, so you get to know if it's worth the 5 bucks for the original.","November 16, 2015","true","1.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","6"

One, the enemies never show up, which is a bunch of crap but it doesn't even matter because the second massive flaw is that THE ALIENS THAT YOU ARE TRYING TO PROTECT ATTACK YOU.

This one offered during play not one crash.A classic game, which gives a lot about the old lore of the series. Of the old series, this is the best.\nCons:If you are a player that wants to have every game in your library on par to the capabilities of your PC this game might not be for you, it's old and it shows.I actually had forgotten how anoying it was to see your squad decimated one by one... oh, and check your squad members... they might choke in weaponry and amunition.\nRecommended just for purpose of Nostalgia\nThe game is good, as always, and it will always be good - if you look at the remakes made recently, you see that the story still holds a lot of live juice inside. It still fascinates players today.\n\nThis given, the game actually is a game people might not used to nowadays, it's hard even on easiest mode.

I appreciate how the interface and geoscape are presented to you with next to no hand-holding. The lack of any sort of tutorial or battle advice works effectively in immersing you in a reality where your enemy threats are truly alien and in every sense of the word too. Experimentation is key, with base building allowing for different types of manufacture and research that have plentiful bounties to offer. The X-COM unit itself can be treated as if a business of it's own which naturally has numerous benefits throughout the course of the game.\n\nYet the actual combat itself is where UFO Defence shows it's true colours, irrespective of how prepared you really are. It doesn't matter what armour you have, what guns you carry or even how experienced your soldiers are: the struggle always remains the same. Your units will miss painfully obvious shots, be felled by a single stray bullet or, most embarassingly of all, panic at the mere sight of a lone alien mook. It is because of the haphazard nature of X-Com's combat that it can feel slow and monotnous, especially as level structures repeat themselves and saves are reloaded numerous times in order to better chances against otherwise unbeatable enemies. Some people love X-COM's combat but I'm most certainly not one of them\n\nEven so, UFO Defense was a major sign-post for the strategy genre because it took these crucial features in the combat and global contest and extended them into a larger experience. Not many games to this day match X-COM for it's scale and even fewer for it's initially brutal learning curve either. Most of you reading this have probably already made up your mind about the series and it's legacy either way, to those who haven't I would only recommend you try them simply to say you've done so. If nothing else, X-COM is capable of eating up weeks of spare-time when it engrosses the best of us and that genuinely is a good thing.","September 15, 2013","true","28.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The interface is almost incomprehensible, there is no tutorial or manual, the game is brutally hard, and the whole thing looks ancient and creaky and terrible. But. You will fear the alien hordes. You will worry over every move. You will manage a global defence network of psionic super soldiors desperately defending the Earth from a massive allegiance of alien monsters. You will lose your days to this game, and the graphics will become great in your mind. You will see what you want to see, as the game consumes you. There has never been another game quite like X-COM, and there probably never will be.","December 10, 2011","true","1.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It was a technical marvel in the there was pratically an endless amount of variety to the levels.\n\nThe complexity of the game, and it's dice roll based nature, unique artwork, foreboding music and challenging encounters, and the fact that it was basically 3 or 4 games rolled together made it a very unique game for its time, and for all time to come.\n\nHalf the fun of the game is failing, if only to learn from those mistakes in order to succeed. X-COM, one of the best games ever made to this day. Good thing the remake lives up to it!

X-Com UFO Defense is one of the most brilliant ideas for a game anyone has ever come up with: a combination of realistic squad tactics and a deep civ-like base management system. I've never experienced a tactical game quite as tense and scary as this one, even today. You never quite know just what will be down there when you search a UFO crash site or an Alien terror site. The way the game merges the research/development into the Alien battles is pure genius, you are never more than a couple minutes away from the next big thing you want to get. In the early 90s the PC thrived on games like X-Com in their startingly realistic and in depth simulations you couldn't get anywhere else.

When it lists difficultly not by degrees of easy or hard, but by levels of experience, it means it. Beginners should start on beginner and graduate to experienced when the title fits. The game start doesn't have any sort of introduction, you're just thrown into the action without an explanation or briefing. You're not well supplied or well funded at the beginning either and you'll need to justify your budget each month, just like a real government agency. I started my first game, lost, and I started over during the first in game month. To help the next person in those shoes, here's a few bits of advice I picked up while learning to play: Rookies are cheap, buy more rookies before you worry about things like tanks; aliens can see in the dark while your soldiers cannot and the entire storyline including the game endpoint (as well as a few very useful research projects) come about after capturing an alien or two alive, so electro-flares and stun rods are not useless; and finally, if you ever see a hunched-over, black, bipedal crab-like alien, get the hell out of there.","May 31, 2014","true","67.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

You may want to go look at some tutorials first, as the game doesn't actually explain what you're supposed to do at the start (this was back in the day, where you were supposed to read the manual before starting play). In short, build up humanity's defense against aliens and take them out in turn based, squad focused tactical combat. The graphics are of course dated now, but the game is still really fun AND HARD. You'll be killed a lot looking for the winning strategy.\n\nI'd also highly recommend the reboot, XCOM, Enemey Unknown. Avoid the old-school sequels like Terror from the Deep, they're just another skin on top of this game with a lot of bugs.","June 1, 2014","true","37.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The grandaddy of tactical turn based strategy games, and still an amazing experience to play.  If you're like me and you grew up playing, you know what X-Com is.  You'll be incredibly disappointed to note that the steam version is the European version and has differences from the NA version, most notably in the sound department.  I downloaded this, fired it up, and was immediately disappointed.  Killing sectoids especially feels much less satisfying with the euro sounds.\n\nIt's still an incredible game and if you've never played it, you should.  It's a hardcore game, even in an era where most games were hardcore.   It's grueling, atmospheric, and intense, and quite a bit dated, but it's still a great game.","September 24, 2015","true","1.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Made back in 1994, it was a truly advanced game back in it's time, and to this day, still stands tall.  You have to micro-manage research, manufacturing, soldiers, base development, and arming your ships.  Then it comes down to tactical, where you have to manage time units instead of getting a set amount of moves per person.  The Alien AI can be a bit stupid at times, but others, extremely viscious and unrelentlessly cold.  The graphics are dated indeed, and the game has to run on an emulator these days, but, this game is still one of the best games I've ever had the pleasure of playing.","January 5, 2014","true","14.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

With plenty of Technology, lore, and strategy, you will be sinking endless hours into this game. HOWEVER, this game takes ages to complete, maybe longer than anyone has to spare.

In fact it may be no coincidence that both games share common traits: they both have stellar gameplay and horrible graphics. Most game developers today seem to have forgotten a simple truth- Gameplay > Graphics. XCOM gives you command of an army of super-soldiers to fight off an alien invasion. Micro-managing is the key to victory and boy....there is plenty of that. You decide everything from where your bases will be / how large or small to how many bullets each soldier carries. The combat is turn-based and the enemy AI , while not as good as later games , can still be very sneaky.\n\nWhat I enjoyed most is how your soldiers *slowly* ramp up in strength via reverse engineering of captured alien tech. There are times when ( if you havent been researching fast enough) you may encounter stronger aliens and still be useing simple guns! Defeating these stonger aliens with current weapons are the great story-making events of the XCOM game.\n\nOh did I mention the RPG elements too? Each soldier in your army has his/ her own stats. These stats can determine things like what weapon they would be best at, if they would make a great scout, a good medic, or if they should be sent packing.\n\nAny fan of RPG + Turn-base + Sci Fi games simply cannot go wrong with this title.\n\n\nRivscore- 99 / 100\n\n++NOTE++ Yes. That's right...99 out of 100. This game is almost perfect. If the Devs would pay for Scarlett Johanson to come to my next birthday party and blow...out my candles it would be 100 / 100.","June 7, 2014","true","2.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Hopefully the presented claim is only little exaggeration. *UFO Defense* gameplay includes multiple aspects such as financial and supply management, base construction planning, research and manufacture organisation, big view world-defense with hypersonic jet planes and later innovative solutions; soldier recruitment and training, as well as turn-based tactical ground combat that the reviewed product pioneered in great extent. Recovery of alien artifacts and technology with their adaptation to Earth-based equipment is crucial to ones development in pursuit of defeating an enemy, whose abilities and ravagery increase with time.\n\nMemories of fine hours dedicated to exploring the world endangered by alien invasion - and its only shield, the international X-COM force - brought me back to this product. I am still under impression of its uniqueness. Nevertheless, for present day, this DosBox version - that STEAM claims to be Windows-compatible - is far from working acceptably. Five euro/dollars for a program older than twenty years is robbery considering the current standards. If you are going to buy *UFO Defense*, do it only for the sake of *OpenXcom* - a fan-made and well done upgrade that greatly enchances the playability of the game, next to optimizing it for modern systems. *OpenXcom* requires the original *UFO Defense* data. Know, yet, that this data are remote files that ought to be available for free already.\n\nIs this game difficult? Whether it is difficult or easy for someone who already knows how to play it, is one thing - but to learn how to play it on minimum required level, is other thing - and that may be tough; be warned. It is a nostalgia purchase nowadays. User-friendliness is hardly a feature here.\n\nI truly admire *UFO Defense*, as well as impressive input that the fandom had into making it so much better experience, therefore I need to be fair with what we get on STEAM at the moment [2016] for the price of five euro/dollars: thumbs down. DosBox version is out of play.","April 21","false","1.6"," 7 of 17 people (41%) found this review helpful","41","7","17","0","0"

Many have tried to clone this game and "improve" upon it, but there is just no beating the classic.\n\nSo why am I not recommending it?\n\nIf, like me, you played it and loved it, you have no need for my review, get it and have fun.\nIf however you never played this game, it is hard getting into and the graphics may put you off. I am fully aware that part of me still loving the game is nostalgia, something you will not have as a new player.\n\nThere are still things that annoy me in this game, like hunting for the final alien in a map, when they are off hiding somewhere. It can get so frustrating that I would send soldiers everywhere, hoping they get shot at just to reveal the enemy. The new XCOM reboot solved this by adding noises that your soldiers can hear to direct you to the enemy.\nAlso, once you have the game figured out, you can get overpowering very easily, with endless amounts of money from producing and selling weapons, to supereasy levels where you can just mind control all the aliens and have them kill each other.","June 23, 2015","false","16.1"," 31 of 77 people (40%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","40","31","77","3","0"

It was a mistake to assume that "good" back then means "good" now. The game is infuriatingly complex -- just navigating the UI to get your soldiers to shoot is a hassle.

Add a brutal level of difficulty and terrible graphics (I don't really care about graphics, but the sprites are just so low-res it's impossible to see what you're looking at), this game simply isn't worth playing in 2016.\n\nEdit: I just realize it says I've only played 0.2h of this.

Given the complexity of this game, you can expect to lose many, many times before making the tiniest smidge of progress. Even the many FAQs and walkthroughs that exist give contradictory information (not to mention that one shouldn't have to consult a walkthrough just to be able to play a game).\n\nI can imagine that when this came out in the sparse game market of the mid-90s, that it was absolutely amazing. I suspect a lot of the positive reviews for it come from people who played it when it first came out. Back then, you wouldn't mind spending hours upon hours playing, even if you were defeated each time. However, games have advanced considerably since then, and its outdated mechanics and unforgiving gameplay make it downright frustrating for new players. Losing is rarely fun.\n\nShort version:\nIf you're looking for a fun strategy game, I recommend buying the reboot, X-COM: Enemy Unknown. It preserves what was great about the original series with updated, simplified mechanics.\nIf you heard this is a classic and you're curious, I recommend watching a Let's Play of it instead. Those people have played it before and know the "right" way to play the game. It will save you time AND grief!\nIf you played this before and loved it, yeah, buy it! Or, check out OpenXCom, an open-source clone of the original game which fixes a lot of problems with running the game on modern machines.","April 12, 2015","false","33.9"," 15 of 63 people (24%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","24","15","63","2","0"

First stop is the original X-Com: UFO Defense.\nRight off the bat I have to give props to whoever was behind the porting. The game runs beautifully and even scales well on a full 1080p display. The sound also is fully functional with only some minor skipping in the opening cutscene. If you were into this game and have a lot of nostalgia for it, then you will love this masterful port.\nAs a brand new player of the X-Com games, I can’t say I have much interest in this original title. I have no doubts that it was a phenomenal experience back upon release, but some games age better than others and the rose tint of nostalgia goggles only works for games you grew up with. UFO Defense has no semblance of a tutorial. I have a feeling that the original game had an awesome manual (as all classic titles did) but Steam doesn’t sell games in boxes. Without a tutorial I had to do a lot of trial and error. Fortunately I understand the premise of the game, but even knowing how the game is supposed to play out I was constantly struggling with the interface and cryptic icons. It took almost 30 minutes of play before I was ever able to see the ground combat and once the mission was underway I quickly lost all patience for the interface. I’m spoiled from all the advancement in interface design and increase in screen real estate, trying to navigate the battlefield and direct my soldiers was nothing but frustrating.\nX-Com: UFO Defense was the spark that started one of gaming's classic and highly regarded franchises but I don’t think it’s aged well. The port is phenomenal and those who grew up with it will be thrilled with this trip down memory lane. However, newcomers will more than likely be put off.","March 4, 2015","false","3.2"," 13 of 59 people (22%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","22","13","59","3","6"

I highly recommend just installing OpenXCOM and not bothering with the original version because it makes the game alot easier to play (I am talking about better controls, graphic enhancements, better menus, etc.).\nThe game plot is quite simple: Alien Invasion > Special Forces (that's you) > Make them go away > ??? > Profit.\nNow it is not as easy as that... by far not: You start with a team of Rookies - and I MEAN Rookies.\n(PRO TIP: Dont have anyone of your team stand anywhere near the line of fire... trust me I didn't pay attention and it... just didn't end too well).\nWell atleast you got two Interceptors aswell and they come in handy when fighting off UFOs.\nOther parts of the game include Research, Base-Building and Extending, Ammunition and Equipment Management and the list goes on and on... so prepare to spend some time on that game (dont worry you have the opportunity to save your progress - In the Original version and in OpenXCOM).\nYou might eventually get wrecked a few times until you are able to play the game decently because there is not too much of a tutorial - it's more like learning by doing - or watching videos i guess - but there are some explanations plus a background story (dont expect too much of that tho) in the game documentation.\n\nNow usually I would write some Pros, Neutrals and Cons here but I didn't play the game long enough to state some good points.

If you love micromanaging, terrable teaching about overly complecated game mechanics, lack of plot, and strategy that, for me, quickly became lackluster once I figured it out(no, i didnt quite because it was too hard. far more complecated, leaning towards too easy), its the game for you.

Don't get me wrong. I love it and still I consider it to be one of the best games ever created. On the other hand I know that learing how to play is really hard. I'm not sure if I'd try to learn it again if I'd be younger lad or just someone who never played it previously. It's game without tutorial and steam gives only some kind of quick reference instead of good old instruction in a form of a quite large book.

It dominated large chunks of my childhood, and despite the outdated graphics, MIDI sound(which still holds up for the most part if you ask me), fairly brutal user interface, and occasional catasrophic bugs while emulating it on a modern rig, it still gets thrown into the mix every few years and played start to finish.\n\nIf you can overlook it's technical problems, and punishing difficulty, and have any imagination whatsoever, it's a great, deep, long ride with endless replayability.  If you can't overlook these things, its second sequel Armageddon, when played in TBS in the tactiacal mode, offers an improved gameplay experience, if IMO a sightly inferior story and over-extended endgame.  The original can't be beat.\n\nTake my advice, and rename your soldiers after friends and family as they start getting promoted past the rookie level, and increasing in skill.  It lends a visceral edge to the gameplay.  You'll flesh out the story for yourself with your squad's triumphs and tragedies as they combat the greatest threat the world has ever faced in the far-flung future of 1999.\n\nWhile the mechanics of tactical combat may not have aged so well, the startegic component of the game is still quite strong.  You coordinate the clandestine worldwide effort to combat a semi-secret alien invasion of earth by tracking, interdicting, and destroying alien craft, researching the invaders and their tech while repurposing it for your own use, and perhaps selling it on the black market to fund X-COM operations.  You may need an extra source of income, as you'll find yourself managing a worldwide network of secret bases employing the best of the Earth's scientific, engineering, and military resources.  That doesn't come cheap, and if you don't produce results, you may find your cash flow from the council of funding nations diminishing, or drying up entirely as the individual members cut their contributions, or drop out of the project entirely to sign a pact with the aliens, giving them another base of Earthly operations.  You've got to keep your elite, multinational, squads of Spec-Ops soldiers supplied with the lastest in life-saving, or death-dealing alien technology as they investigate UFO crash and landing sites, recover advanced alien technology, defend the helpless populations of Earth's terrorized towns and cities composed of several distict terrain types in randomly-generated tactical missions.  You'll use what they discover and recover during these missions and back at your on-base laboritories to finally be able to gain the upper hand and take the fight to the aliens in their hidden bases on Earth, as you strive to kick them out of the solar system once and for all.\n\nSeriously.  This game rocks.  Often imitated, but to my knowledge, never excelled to this day.  If you're not a graphics snob, have ever enjoyed a turn-based strategy game, and you have a few dollars(and potentially lots of time) to spend, you have no excuse not to try it now that it's on Steam.  There's a reason people make DOS emulators for modern machines.  This game is the best reason to download one.","September 16, 2014","true","18.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It was awesome back in 1995. It is still pretty great! I loved this game before the turn of the century! lol!! I can't believe I had found a 3 pack of XCOM games on sale for $5 or $15 back then. What a great game!\n\nI absolutely love how if you shoot High Explosives into a wall, it can disentregrate!\n\nPros:Can always buy more soldiers!\nAll soldiers have newly generated stats!\nSoldiers can gain ranks and increase their current stats!\nSoldiers with high strength are a good choice for heavy weapons.\nHeavy weapons have 2-3 types of ammo. AP-Armor Piercing; HE-High Explosive; I-Incindiary(Fire)\nA great selection of grenades and even high explosives.\nWhy bother with high explosives, if you can assign a soldier to carry a rocket launcher! (lol)\nCan research recovered alien weapons and aircraft!\nTactics and gun fire during battle are great!\nIf you leave enough movement points for a soldier at the end of the round, they will be able to fire their weapons at enemies during the enemy's round, if the enemy walks into their view.\nCan kneel to increase accuracy and decrease size.\nLots of different types of aliens to fight, recover, and research!\nCan capture aliens for research!\nThere is never an easy fight just because you have the best armor available. You still have to use your brains.\nYour factories can build everything you have researched, except for Elerium 115.\nNeed for the resource Elerium 115 forces you to locate more aliens to advance your equipment.Cons:All soldiers are desired to have high accuracy. Unless you use them as a medic or psychic.\nCan not train soldiers outside of combat.\nSoldiers can be one-shot killed with heavy weapons, even while wearing heavy armor.\nThere is no quick way to run through 10 battles.\nBattles become repetitive, but by this time you will have aquired enough money to explore using big weapons during combat.\n(Which caused me to use the Ghost Buster's theory of blowing holes in walls at and around any enemy seen, no matter how much damage it would cause. lol.\n"Its a little alien... Arm the rocket launcher! Auto fire the incindiary explosives from the auto cannon!" BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! KA-BOOM!)\nSmall bugs that you would never normally see. (Assigning more than 256 scientists to the same research project will cause a roll-over into negative integers. This will either cause you to have an infinite number of scientists for many projects, or if you ever roll the number of available scientists to zero - it will cause you to have zero scientists with zero lab space for the scientists. -But like I said, you will NEVER see this bug while playing a regular game. But a regular game would take over a hundred hours to play.\nGiving yourself a hundred million dollars will give you the means to build 6 research laboratories (300 lab seats), and then hiring 300 scientists to research. What would normally take over half a year of game time to research with earned funds and two dozen scientists.)\nFor some reason, this seems to have caused another bug where I am not shown what I researched when research is complete. But playing this game for a full nother 500 hours is not what I had in mind. I just want to beat the game, since I no longer have my save file from 1996.\nMy old 2010 review follows:\n"However, I did get bored when I started tracking the aliens back to their home planet in space. Became a huge amount of repetition, taking over space ships and the alien home base. When I got bored I stopped playing, even though I was really close to the end game. Repetition = torture in my book.\n\nVery fun game! Wish they would make a 'good' sequal that wasn't the same game over and over again. For example, XCOM 2 was the same game as XCOM 1, but in the oceans of earth instead of on land. But all the equipment was changed and modified to be underwater equipment. I'm sure the aliens were different too."","December 2, 2010","true","40.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Otherwise, if you want a more modern take on the game, yet still want it as true to the original as possible (i.e. without being streamlined like XCOM, and maintaining the same exhilaratingly tough difficulty curve), give Xenonauts a try.","November 19, 2010","true","52.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

They say you can never go back but, playing this game, it was possible for me in a sense. Secondly, this game can be hard. It's a strategy game and the game makes you learn the mechanics well lest you waste your squads as you investigate the various UFO encounters.\n\nThis game does have a bit of a learning curve and those put off by retro graphics (which I dig) might be put off but I would suggest giving it a try.

Initially, when I first played it back in 2001, I didn't know any strategies, secrets, tactics, hints, guides, or helpful advice existed. I just played and got my squads wrecked, over and over again. But, I kept playing. It was that good! Ten years later, I played it again, because I learned about the strategy guides which exist now. The game was even more exciting, because I could control the battles. Again I played in 2014, refreshing my experience and reliving the plight of X-Com. Anyway, down to the details.\n\nThe graphics, by today's standards, are cheesy, super-pixelated and difficult to interpret (at times). Even cheesier is the quality of music/sound effects. However, the sound is probably the single most-definitive characteristic in the game. The ominous sound effects severely impact the immersion in the battle. Without realizing it, I get sucked into the tension, because of the ominous pulsating background noise. Finally, the turn-based battlescape strategy style which beckons for perfection. Master strategists would struggle to survive some of those battles. One word: Chryssalids.\n\nTLDR: Sci-Fi themed, turn-based strategy (with a side of Real-time Spaceship chase scenarios), in-depth immersion.\n\nP.S. - If you can't beat em, get a bigger Blaster Launcher.","September 1, 2014","true","326.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game is incredible, and anyone who likes strategy or turn based tactics games will love it.\n\nOh, just two things.

It was unique at the time. I had never seen anything like it.  It was a thinking game.  You had to use small unit tactics to get the job done, or your squad would be history.  I remember being wowed by discovering the next alien to show up.  It was  a great game then, and it is still a very good game.  No, it hasn't got the awesome visual effects, the incredible sound effects that modern games do, but its got great mechanics. Every mission is a challenge, especially when sectoids are mind controlling you squad members and using them against you.  There is  always element of chaos, where you never know what is going to happen next, and a bit of bad luck can make you have to rethink your tactics on the fly.  Toward the end, some of the missions get pretty routine as your solders get tougher and more experienced, but there is always that one last mission looming ahead; the end game that puts a stop, once and for all, to the alien menace.

Fights feel like a genuine struggle to survive the onslaught.

I started with XCOM: Enemy Unknown and loved that before coming over to this one, and already see where Enemy Unknown was lacking. You can place your base anywhere you want to, there are more options for customizing each soldier, and the transports and Interceptors are much more detailed and user-controlled.\n\nI would highly recommend this game if you don't mind the old-school graphics and gameplay. This game is famous for setting you off without any kind of tutorial, or even hints. The first few games I played were just learning what everything did, and how the game worked. Although I did spend quite some time in Enemy Unknown; this game is much harder to learn, and much more advanced. I am glad that I played Enemy Unknown first and loved it, otherwise this game would have made Enemy Unknown look like some Indie version or something with only enhanced graphics. This game is just THAT much more detailed and advanced.\n\nThe only problems with this game are the steep learning curves, I still have not gotten far enough to write about mid-to-late gameplay, and how unforgiving it can be with grenades. If you arm a grenade, the turn to throw it, you might not have enough time to actually throw the grenade, which only leaves you with dropping it on the ground and hoping he can get far enough away from it before it goes off (he won't).","August 7, 2015","true","58.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The 2012 remake was a faithful remake, but this is the one that I will always come back to.  You as a player have to remember all the trivial aspects, such as remembering to save time for returning your soldiers to cover, crouching, and having time for overwatch.  Your soldiers have a high mortality rate, but (while alive) they have many individual statistics and personal growth.

X-COM never pulls any punches as you work hundreds of scientists over countless sleepless nights, trying to understand alien technology before your feeble human forces are swept aside. A UFO is spotted over Europe, and an alien terror mission is destroying a village in Africa. Where do you send aid? What do you do when the troops hit the ground, and what happens if you discover that you are dealing with two different aliens with two different intentions? With limited funding, balanced on the moods of the temperamental leaders of the world, you must find a way to answer these questions. But you have to answer them quickly, because when the alien threat learns of your mission they will be coming for you next. X-COM is a game of real consequences; you know what the stakes are.

The game blends high-level global strategy with the small-scale tactical challenge of skirmish battles for a still-unmatched gaming experience.\nThe mechanics behind the tactical battles are incredibly detailed, and provide nearly unlimited flexibility and choice. For example, all terrain is destructible, your fighters have nearly unlimited choice of actions (they may even toss out-of-ammo friends additional magazines or even whole loaded weapons!) and each battle presents unique challenges. You command a small squad of approximately a dozen soldiers who gain experience, improve their abilities and accrue injuries over the course of the campaign. Missions are as diverse as clearing UFO crash sites and recovering alien artifacts, defending populated areas from alien terror attacks, raiding functional enemy vessels or ground bases and even defending your own base(s) of operations from a determined enemy attack! Each of these tactical battles is important to the global strategy component, so you don't want to lose a battle as it may have lasting consequences to the rest of the game, but by the same token sometimes you won't even be able to show up to a particular engagement as you are forced to pick your battles in order to win the war! For example, you may be more concerned with protecting a country that provides substantial income for you than one who is less monetarily crucial to you. Later in the campaign you can manage your greater resources to allow you to build additional bases, allowing coverage of more of the globe so that hopefully you won't have to make such compromises.\nIn addition to this you have the capacity to expand each base's facilities, increasing the number of fighters and transports at your disposal, or expanding your research or production capabilities. Research is an important aspect of the game, as you gather alien technology and reverse engineer working models for your soldiers to use in battle. As you progress up the alien tech tree new weapons and armour will be made available for you to produce, most of which outperforms your meager Earth technology. You might even start making ends meet, financially speaking, by selling some of the valuable alien tech you discover (or even create...) on the black market to the discerning, and wealthy, private collectors of the world!\nThe game's greatest failings (and they certainly do exist) are almost invariably caused by its clunky user interface and painstaking inability to remember previous choices. For example, performing actions with your fighters takes ages to complete - part of this is the price of such unparalleled flexibility, but part of it is just poor design. Worse than this though, you must equip each of your soldiers before every battle. The computer seems to randomly assign them the gear available, and then you need to sort through each and every one of them, removing gear, assigning it to another soldier, then giving them the correct equipment which the game gave to another soldier. It is tedious and would be an immense waste of time but for the fact that if you don't do it, no one will have the correct weapons at the start of the fight!\nBear in mind that those literally the only complaints I have against the game - it's otherwise poor graphical quality is forgiven on account of its venerable age, and its at-first opaque controls require a thorough read of the game manual to explain them (though this is available through steam). I would strongly recommend new players visit the X-COM wiki in order to familiarize yourself with the game, its controls and the mechanics before having a go, as its complexity can be daunting at first. However, once you get beyond that initial uncertainty the game yields endless rewards for anyone willing to play it through to completion!\nKeep an eye on the still in-development 'Xenonauts' as it is described as the "spiritual successor" of this game. Xenonauts appears to be created with everything amazing about the original X-COM game while improving the graphics, user interface and overall making it more modern and appealing. I look forward to this game finishing development! (How they will avoid being sued with a game that is so obviously just a re-engineered version of X-COM is beyond me, but if they can pull it off you can be sure that I'll be all over it!) That is in contrast to the recently released X-COM: Enemy Unknown game, which stripped out all of the excellent features I've detailed above and left you with limited (and oftimes nonsensical) choices, extremely pretty graphics and little else. Despite its failings and age, I would recommend the original X-COM over the modern one every day of the week (and twice on Tuesdays).","May 3, 2014","true","22.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Sounds simple enough, but once you go into the game and really get your feet on the ground of your first battle, that changes. Think tactically, use your turns wisely, and never let your soldiers go Rambo, or else you'll end the mission with an even higher casualty count than usual.

The game was even more exciting, because I could control the battles. Again I played in 2014, refreshing my experience and reliving the plight of X-Com. Anyway, down to the details.\n\nThe graphics, by today's standards, are cheesy, super-pixelated and difficult to interpret (at times). Even cheesier is the quality of music/sound effects. However, the sound is probably the single most-definitive characteristic in the game. The ominous sound effects severely impact the immersion in the battle. Without realizing it, I get sucked into the tension, because of the ominous pulsating background noise. Finally, the turn-based battlescape strategy style which beckons for perfection. Master strategists would struggle to survive some of those battles. One word: Chryssalids.\n\nTLDR: Sci-Fi themed, turn-based strategy (with a side of Real-time Spaceship chase scenarios), in-depth immersion.\n\nP.S. - If you can't beat em, get a bigger Blaster Launcher.","September 1, 2014","true","326.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Probably the best thing about this title are its replayability and difficulty, which even on the lowest of 5 levels, is very high.

It is very complex, but is still easy to learn and understand. The game gives the player lots of options and freedom in defeating the alien invasion. The variety of options also creates a large replay value.\n\n\nLong: To begin, the Windows 7 version runs via DosBox. The default settings limit the cycle speed, meaning the game can have very low FPS counts sometimes. Manually changing the cycle limit will allow you to increase the FPS for smoother gameplay.\n\nThe controls via DosBox are all cursor-based, as far as I know. The keyboard is simply not used at all. Keyboard controls could be useful, so I will say this is a con.\n\nThe game itself has tons of options for players. There are some base management aspects, where you can build new facilities in the X-COM bases or build new bases altogether. This stuff is pretty simple (not really any micro managing) but allows for a large variety of different base configurations. Supplies and personel (soldiers, scientists, and engineers) can be bought/hired and sold/fired and can also be transferred between bases. Scientists research new technology from base labs which can allow your engineers to manufactor new weapons, vehicles, armor, or other useful things. Funding is a concern; your funding is automatically adjusted each month based on your performance in stopping the alien menace. You can also gain funds by selling supplies you find or produce.\n\nThe geo map view looks nice (for Dos) and is where you order your aircraft to shoot down UFOs or to land squads at landed UFOs/crashed UFOs/terror sites/alien bases. When you land at a site, you can customize the loadout of each soldier based on what equipment was in the landing craft. Tactical combat is solid but difficult; raw recruits and even semi-skilled soldiers are absolutely terrible shots. There is a variety of different weapons, grenades, and other equipment that your soldiers can use. There are several types of aliens that are mostly quite unique from each other. After neutralizing all aliens at a site, you also automatically collect their loot--the alien weaponry and supplies can be used by your soldiers or sold for profit.\n\nBy researching new technologies and interrogating captured aliens, the end-game content and final missions to beat the game are revealed. Overall, it is a very enjoyable experience and the variety of options means there is a great degree of replayability. I highly recommend the game.","January 16, 2014","true","75.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For the first few missions the best you can hope for are pyrrhic victories. Your untested and underequipped soldiers are just no match for the high-tech alien menace. They raid the cities of the earth with impunity. France drops funding and begins to conspire with the aliens. You may begin to despair.\n\nAs you suffer, though, your squad grows more and more powerful. You unlock new technologies that put you on par with the invaders. You finally have a chance. The victories come more regularly, as do exciting new discoveries.\n\nBy the end game you have cultivated an army of power-armored supersoldiers with terrible psychic powers. Your enemies quail at the sight of your squad. Once terrible foes are now your puppets, forced to gun down their comrades or simply drop plasma grenades at their own feet.\n\nIt is immensely satisfying, in a way that few games today are.

It was awesome back in 1995. It is still pretty great! I loved this game before the turn of the century! lol!! I can't believe I had found a 3 pack of XCOM games on sale for $5 or $15 back then. What a great game!\n\nI absolutely love how if you shoot High Explosives into a wall, it can disentregrate!\n\nPros:Can always buy more soldiers!\nAll soldiers have newly generated stats!\nSoldiers can gain ranks and increase their current stats!\nSoldiers with high strength are a good choice for heavy weapons.\nHeavy weapons have 2-3 types of ammo. AP-Armor Piercing; HE-High Explosive; I-Incindiary(Fire)\nA great selection of grenades and even high explosives.\nWhy bother with high explosives, if you can assign a soldier to carry a rocket launcher! (lol)\nCan research recovered alien weapons and aircraft!\nTactics and gun fire during battle are great!\nIf you leave enough movement points for a soldier at the end of the round, they will be able to fire their weapons at enemies during the enemy's round, if the enemy walks into their view.\nCan kneel to increase accuracy and decrease size.\nLots of different types of aliens to fight, recover, and research!\nCan capture aliens for research!\nThere is never an easy fight just because you have the best armor available. You still have to use your brains.\nYour factories can build everything you have researched, except for Elerium 115.\nNeed for the resource Elerium 115 forces you to locate more aliens to advance your equipment.Cons:All soldiers are desired to have high accuracy. Unless you use them as a medic or psychic.\nCan not train soldiers outside of combat.\nSoldiers can be one-shot killed with heavy weapons, even while wearing heavy armor.\nThere is no quick way to run through 10 battles.\nBattles become repetitive, but by this time you will have aquired enough money to explore using big weapons during combat.\n(Which caused me to use the Ghost Buster's theory of blowing holes in walls at and around any enemy seen, no matter how much damage it would cause. lol.\n"Its a little alien... Arm the rocket launcher! Auto fire the incindiary explosives from the auto cannon!" BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! KA-BOOM!)\nSmall bugs that you would never normally see. (Assigning more than 256 scientists to the same research project will cause a roll-over into negative integers. This will either cause you to have an infinite number of scientists for many projects, or if you ever roll the number of available scientists to zero - it will cause you to have zero scientists with zero lab space for the scientists. -But like I said, you will NEVER see this bug while playing a regular game. But a regular game would take over a hundred hours to play.\nGiving yourself a hundred million dollars will give you the means to build 6 research laboratories (300 lab seats), and then hiring 300 scientists to research. What would normally take over half a year of game time to research with earned funds and two dozen scientists.)\nFor some reason, this seems to have caused another bug where I am not shown what I researched when research is complete. But playing this game for a full nother 500 hours is not what I had in mind. I just want to beat the game, since I no longer have my save file from 1996.\nMy old 2010 review follows:\n"However, I did get bored when I started tracking the aliens back to their home planet in space. Became a huge amount of repetition, taking over space ships and the alien home base. When I got bored I stopped playing, even though I was really close to the end game. Repetition = torture in my book.\n\nVery fun game! Wish they would make a 'good' sequal that wasn't the same game over and over again. For example, XCOM 2 was the same game as XCOM 1, but in the oceans of earth instead of on land. But all the equipment was changed and modified to be underwater equipment. I'm sure the aliens were different too."","December 2, 2010","true","40.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It was unique at the time. I had never seen anything like it.  It was a thinking game.  You had to use small unit tactics to get the job done, or your squad would be history.  I remember being wowed by discovering the next alien to show up.  It was  a great game then, and it is still a very good game.  No, it hasn't got the awesome visual effects, the incredible sound effects that modern games do, but its got great mechanics. Every mission is a challenge, especially when sectoids are mind controlling you squad members and using them against you.  There is  always element of chaos, where you never know what is going to happen next, and a bit of bad luck can make you have to rethink your tactics on the fly.  Toward the end, some of the missions get pretty routine as your solders get tougher and more experienced, but there is always that one last mission looming ahead; the end game that puts a stop, once and for all, to the alien menace.

I've found that it is actually quite nice.\n\nAnother thing that impressed me was that most of the technology you get from reverse engineering the aliens tech. so you have to beat it to use it. All the alien technologies in the game have some amount of lore. in addition to that your guys are horrible at aiming until they gain several ranks but they usually dont last long enough for that. I will warn you that this is hard at least at first and just because you beat the mission doesnt mean you will increase your score.\n\nIt is also cool how the aliens have superior technology so you have to have superior tactics to kill them. most of your guys will die in 1 or 2 shots from the aliens but they can usually stand around 2-3 and sometimes the more powerful aliens can withstand more in the region of 8 shots.\n\nIn the story, the different countries of the world in their fear of the alien threat have banded together to fund the xcom project to aid in the protection of earth. Each month you are evaluated on your score gain/loss during that month.

Every mission different. Base management, crew management, work with a fixed economy.\nCons - User interface takes a while to get used to. Don't accidentally click on the wrong thing in battle or you can loose your guys pretty easily.\nWhy 7? - I have replayed this game so many times, and the fact you can save before you do something, do it, and reload if you don't like what happens means I replayed the same game several times over.

It was unique at the time. I had never seen anything like it.  It was a thinking game.  You had to use small unit tactics to get the job done, or your squad would be history.  I remember being wowed by discovering the next alien to show up.  It was  a great game then, and it is still a very good game.  No, it hasn't got the awesome visual effects, the incredible sound effects that modern games do, but its got great mechanics. Every mission is a challenge, especially when sectoids are mind controlling you squad members and using them against you.  There is  always element of chaos, where you never know what is going to happen next, and a bit of bad luck can make you have to rethink your tactics on the fly.  Toward the end, some of the missions get pretty routine as your solders get tougher and more experienced, but there is always that one last mission looming ahead; the end game that puts a stop, once and for all, to the alien menace.  You know during in those final few missions you're gearing up or the big one.","May 31, 2015","true","22.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's sole purpose is to combat a growing extraterrestrial threat on Earth and investigate the reasoning behind this.\n\nUnlike many other Strategy games, XCOM is a blend of micromanagement and turn based combat. When not in combat, players are thrown into a real-time management stage where they can allocate and coordinate their resources towards fighting the aliens. This includes researching new technology, studying alien artifacts, constructing bases and recruiting personel.\n\nXCOM is unique strategy game.

Hands down.  There was nothing like it before and while many tried to be like it, none could do it properly.\n\nIf you overlook the outdated graphics, you still get the best strategy game created.  Every decision you make matters and every event large or small is important.  You start out woefully underequipped and inexperienced to deal with the alien invasion.  Your soldiers suffer massive casualties when you start out from the disparity in equipment you would expect between current earth tech vs an invading alien.  Every soldier lost hurts, but not nearly as much as the loss of your long-term survivors who become stronger with every rank.  Losing a corporal stings, but losing a colonel hurts.  Sometimes the only solution is to throw lots of soldiers at the aliens and hope at least 2 or 3 survive to go on, but it's a desperate time and you have to make the hard choices.  The fate of the Earth is in your hands!\n\nI only wish steam existed when this came out originally to see how many hours people put into this true gem of a game.  I know I spent months playing, replaying, and doing it yet again when this was new.  I still play this version at times just for the trip down memory lane back to a time when you could sink hundreds of hours into a game and still lose!  None of that easy wins in games like you see now.  To win this game, you worked for it and you put in the time to do it.\n\nEveryone who does strategy games needs to own this one to see where games today got their inspirations and how this one game changed pc gaming for all time.","August 3, 2015","true","37.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I started with XCOM: Enemy Unknown and loved that before coming over to this one, and already see where Enemy Unknown was lacking. You can place your base anywhere you want to, there are more options for customizing each soldier, and the transports and Interceptors are much more detailed and user-controlled.\n\nI would highly recommend this game if you don't mind the old-school graphics and gameplay. This game is famous for setting you off without any kind of tutorial, or even hints. The first few games I played were just learning what everything did, and how the game worked. Although I did spend quite some time in Enemy Unknown; this game is much harder to learn, and much more advanced. I am glad that I played Enemy Unknown first and loved it, otherwise this game would have made Enemy Unknown look like some Indie version or something with only enhanced graphics. This game is just THAT much more detailed and advanced.\n\nThe only problems with this game are the steep learning curves, I still have not gotten far enough to write about mid-to-late gameplay, and how unforgiving it can be with grenades. If you arm a grenade, the turn to throw it, you might not have enough time to actually throw the grenade, which only leaves you with dropping it on the ground and hoping he can get far enough away from it before it goes off (he won't).","August 7, 2015","true","58.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Use fighter craft to shoot down UFOs, send squads to attack any living aliens at the crash site. Collect alien technology and put it to the defense of earth.\nPros - Every game different. Every mission different. Base management, crew management, work with a fixed economy.\nCons - User interface takes a while to get used to. Don't accidentally click on the wrong thing in battle or you can loose your guys pretty easily.\nWhy 7? - I have replayed this game so many times, and the fact you can save before you do something, do it, and reload if you don't like what happens means I replayed the same game several times over. Fixes my OCD tendancy to not loose anything but isn't realistic.  It is very complex also and took many playthroughs to get all the details of this game.","June 13, 2015","true","67.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The audio is buggy, game often lags behind, and, for some people, this might stop them from playing.\nHowever, there is a alternative way to play the game. Purchasing the game on steam grants you dosbox, and xcom ufo defense. I run the game in OpenXcom though, mainly due to the fact that (1) it doesn't have the same problems as dosbox,and (2) the game is open-source with oOpenXcom, granting more moddability.\nThat being said, I this should only be purchased for the game files, then installed using OpenXcom.","January 27","true","13.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I was reviewing the magazines in the news stand and happened to spot the monthly edition of PC Gamer. Bundled with it was a disc with tons of great "retro" games as well as a reviews on all of them, a "blast from the past" edition so to speak. Included on that magical CD-ROM were mythical amazing games like Duke Nukem 3D, the original Wing Commander series, Ultima Underworld, and a game I knew nothing about at the time called XCOM: UFO Defense. Little did I know that I was about to embark upon a terrifying yet satisfying journey of my life, one that would force me to forever use a night light as I slept because I feared "they" would come for me as I slept. This is a game that I've played and replayed multiple times for countless hours. Words like "awesome" "amazing" and "epic" simply cannot sum up how much of a blast this game is to play. I cannot recommend it enough if you're looking to get back to the roots of the game that inspired the equally-amazing XCOM reboot games. Do not hestitate to add this one to your collection, with a price tag of only a couple of bucks, you really can't go wrong!","February 6","true","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

They are fun and brutally dificult games, and definitely not for the faint of  heart. I fully recommend these unless you aren't up to the challenge of commanding a squad to fight against some aliens (who are infinitely more powerful than you, by the way). 10/10, would replay several times, though out of these several times I would probably only beat it once or twice.","February 6","true","46.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You manage the Earth's UFO defense force. And when I say manage I mean you control it all, down to the very last bullet that you purchase to arm your force. Invest in aircraft to shoot down UFOs, fly to the crash sites and mop up the remaining aliens before they get away! You can take alien artifacts and research them to figure out what they do, replicate and manufacture them for yourself, and gain vast knowledge of the unknown enemy. You can even take alien corpses and preform an autopsy to gain knowledge of the way each specific type of alien even goes about functioning. In this game, knowledge is power. The first thing I recommend EVERYONE research is laser tech, makes the beginning of an EXTREMELY difficult game a little bit easier.
