The game brought all the fun it did before. I was really happy when they released it on steam on February 24, 2015. You play as a robot who travels across the universe to help humanity save the earth and to solve puzzles that an unthinking robot couldn't solve while all at the same time he is craving love. WHAT COULD BE BETTER THAN THAT??? This game holds the title Wall- E(rated E for everyone) so well. When they made this game it was definitely for the excellent gameplay.","March 6, 2015","true","10.8"," 22 of 25 people (88%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","88","22","25","4","0"

And on Febuary 24 2015 they added 10 new games and went to go and buy it as soon as I saw it but it wasn't in my Library until I checked today. This game is a game I will treasure for the rest of my life. I just wish Disney could as add the Ratatouille game, another game that I remember was the Radiator Springs game.","February 27, 2015","true","4.9"," 28 of 39 people (72%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","72","28","39","3","3"

Seeing it on steam eight years later, I was thrilled to buy it and try it again. Although this isn't one of the best games out there by any means, I enjoy playing it as much as any other game, mainly for nostalgia, and also because it's just an overall great game! The puzzles, while not difficult, are fun and exiting, and the gameplay couldn't be much better! This is one of my favorite later-childhood games, and even as an adult, it's still very enjoyable!","February 6","true","1.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Instead there is an extremely small level around the truck and the only thing to do is break 30 boxes. Son would have been happy to have control of the tv in the truck (press E and play a small clip or something) and be able to open and close the truck's cargo door. Alas.\n\nGraphics are worse than PlayStation 2 Shrek the Third from ~2007 and the camera controls are a little too hard for little kids.","February 27, 2015","false","173.8"," 18 of 85 people (21%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","21","18","85","14","10"

Game mechanics is well done.  It´s not too hard but not boringly easy. The soundtrack is nice. No voice acting. Only negative point - the rendered movie sequences are quite low in quality. Get it if you want to relax.","April 27","true","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
