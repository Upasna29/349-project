On top of that an annoying fly that tells you what to do every two seconds. Just avoid the game.\n\nOh yeah, the font in the game doesn't scale, so it's very hard to read on 1920x1080.

Vulgar, dumbed down, sexed up, unimaginative and done by formula. The fly that stops you all the time to show you strange texts that don't fit in speech balloons was just what the game needed - to make me quit. I played original Prehistorik (both episodes), it was fun. This is no fun. Also, original games (esp. the 2nd one) have better (and more original) art, music and sound. And load up faster.","December 18, 2015","false","0.1"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","10","13","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fandango89/recommended/331660/","fandango89","Apparently Kid","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fandango89/","599 products in account","As everyone already seems to know, this game sucks. Port of an IPAD app. You can't change any video settings or anything else. Controller doesn't work until you fuss with it. The scream ability didn't work even when I rebound it to multiple buttons. There isn't much story. For a platformer, this game basically can't get anything right that it should. You are supposed to bounce off of people's heads, but half the time it hurts you, and the other half it lets you bounce. Unfortunately instead of being able to bounce high like you'd think, you have to press jump at the EXACT second you touch their head, and this is ultra finnicky and doesn't work alot, so it's such an obvious pleasure that so many places require you to do this to proceed, sometimes multiple times in a row in quick succession. The level design is the worst i've ever seen in a platformer. You will be on a ledge and there will be literally nothing in front of you, you just have to jump forward and and hope with random luck you land on something......how stupid can they be. This happens so often you'll wonder what they were thinking. But the worst offender of all are the ropes. For some reason, in a platform game with ropes you have to climb, THEY WON'T LET YOU GRAB THEM!!! You will jump up to the ropes only to go through them without grabbing on at all. You will do the same thing 5 times in a row and the 6th time it will finally let you grab on. On one boss you have to climb 4 ropes in a row. I would constantly make it up 1 or 2, only for the 3rd or 4th to not let me grab onto it and I would fall all the way down and have to start again. How can you not get grabbing onto a rope right in a platform game. Also you will constantly jump to a platform and you will actually land on the side of it, but the game won't count it and you will just fall through, which never gets old. So a platformer that couldn't get right: landing on platforms, jumping off of enemies, or climbing things......yeah definitely a stinker. 4/10.","June 4, 2015","false","1.2"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","8","11","0","0"

You are a caveman that listens to a gibberish talking flea; on your mission to collect your missing stash of junk food. The maps are plain Jane and get boring after a few quick minutes.\n\nIf anything I would consider this a kid’s game, but it's not really what I'd want them playing with some odd humor. (Example: strange man in trench coat flashes you while collecting junk food? Ok.) I enjoy inappropriate content, but this doesn't fit with the game.\n\nOverall, it’s too dumb and mindless for an adult... too mindless and vulgar for a kid.\n\nWorth $0.25-$0.50\n\nAccidently ReviewedWas this review helpful or maybe even not helpful?

After playing I really can't see any issues,  Its really well made and I would give it 10/10! Not my usual genre but I have really enjoyed playing it. Many hours of fun to be had. Well worth the money. Would make a perfect Christmas gift for younger gamers.","October 15, 2015","true","1.1"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/impelus/recommended/331660/","impelus","Pepe Roni","http://steamcommunity.com/id/impelus/","4202 products in account","I bought this game because it looked like a fun little platform at a great price. I really like when games are priced low to begin with, but that may be part of the reason this game is lacking. I've only played it for around 1 hour (I've got 8 extra hours logged because I alt+tabbed out and forgot the game was running when I went to sleep), and all I've really done was play the first level a few times. Why a few times? Because I like to get 100%, but the level layouts are very difficult to see where all of the collectibles might be. I got 99% of the food on my last run and then it bummed me out so I quit. I guess I really shouldn't care about 100% because there is no achievements, but it's still nice to know you've got everything. I still gave this a positive review because it is still ok based on it's price. Also, the reviews are already mixed, so this review won't changed much. If I was the first to review, I probably would have given it a thumbs down. I do plan on going back and playing it more and maybe then I'll update this review.","November 10, 2014","true","8.9"," 11 of 24 people (46%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","46","11","24","0","0"

I truly like when recreations are estimated low regardless, yet that may be a reason's piece this game is inadequate. I've just played it for around 60 minutes (I have 8 additional hours logged on the grounds that I alt+tabbed out and overlooked the game was running when I went to rest), and all I've truly done was play the first level a couple times. Why a couple times? Since I get a kick out of the chance to get 100%, however the level formats are extremely hard to see where the greater part of the collectibles may be. I got 99% of the nourishment on my last run and after that it mooched me out so I quit. I figure I truly shouldn't think about 100% on the grounds that there is no accomplishments, however it's still pleasant to know you have everything.","October 12, 2015","true","10.3"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"
