If your heroes ready for new adventure Riva is open for you.\n\n\nA bit late , but i reccomend to edit - dosboxrealms3.conf - this file can be found in the game directory, few lines have to be changed: scaler=advmame2x ; cycles=18000 . scaler makes picture a bit softer and 18000 cycles looks like the optimal speed.","January 11, 2014","true","0.1"," 148 of 178 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","148","178","0","3"

Nostalgia comes to a great obstacle to review this game without being partial, but the magic and world immersion I experience when I play this game is something have never experienced in any other one.\n\nAfter 17 years and tons of RPG that surely have better presentation and even better story/quests/features I'm still waiting to a game that can absorve you as much as this one does. Can't say what is it, probably the amount of time you spend in it walking around the city, talking to everybody, suffering with and for your characters or maybe the care that was put to make each one of them human and unique (those positve/negative skills and that journal....); but sure that you end loving each one of the characters you created and feel that you shared the most amazing adventure ever with them in a world that you can believe and makes you feel that there's even much more than what you see in the game.\n\nAlso difficult to not notice the amazing soundtrack. Sounds a bit midi nowadays, but it is still extremely effective. Prepare to beautiful melodies in woods, scary ones at dungeons, nostalgic songs at inns and some creepy tracks for that creepy levels where you just don't dare to keep walking and only think about going home.","February 2, 2014","true","0.2"," 48 of 51 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","48","51","0","0"

A Bug makes the game almost unplayable, because entering a house takes about half a minute to go to the next screen, it's crippling. Very unfortunate, would have loved to play this game.","May 4, 2015","false","0.3"," 9 of 18 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","9","18","2","3"
