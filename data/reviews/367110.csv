"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thatfuzzytiger/recommended/367110/","thatfuzzytiger","Hobbes","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thatfuzzytiger/","3197 products in account","When the dust falls, great stories are told...\nDustbowl appeared silently on Steam a few days ago. No fanfare, no publicity, one moment silence and the next. *poof* It's here. A little slice of retro-apocalypse goodness. The brainchild of two developers, Dustbowl is set after the visitations of an alien race who covered the land in a biochemical dust that quite literally rendered the surface of the planet unlivable. A toxic, barren wasteland (drawing inspiration from the UFO afterlight storyline) where what remains of humanity gathers together in small underground shelters, away from danger, away from the light.\n\nTechnology has fallen apart, and humanity lives precariously on the cusp of extinction, this is very much the death throes of society, with people still struggling to come to terms with what has happened. Worse, your shelter seems to be suffering a major case of the shakes, prompting the leader of the shelter to call two of the most experienced surface scavengers to a meeting, and to plea to them for assistance. One, your father, reluctantly volunteers to see what is causing the tremors, leaving you alone in the shelter to find your way, and find answers.\n\nGreat Storytelling and an Intricate World...\nThe world of dustbowl is consistent, and very quickly shows itself to be deep, full of characters suffering and broken by the very events that have driven them underground, the survivors in the HUB feel just like that, survivors by necessity. Some showing clear signs of depression, others panicking and more concerned about their own skin, others yet just getting slam drunk because "who cares, the world is going to hell"\n\nAnd this is just the first area, once you get out into the game overworld, it's not going to get any more cute and cuddly either, I can assure you of that much. The game overworld is meaty, sporting multiple locations that will require you to either talk, shoot or puzzle your way through them. The game falls somewhere between a Role Playing Game and a point and click adventure, and even borrows some elements from survival sandbox games with thirst, hunger and tiredness being perennial beasts that stalk you every step of the way. In case you're feeling particularly masochistic, the developers even put in a hardcore mode, which yes, will delete your save file when you die. You will die. This game does not pull punches.\n\nThe ambition of the game fights against the engine, which creaks at times...\nIf there is one criticism I could, and should level at this game, it's that the game engine (Adventure Game Maker) is almost certainly running at the absolute roof of it's capability here. The developer has crafted a masterpiece in Dustbowl, but make no mistake, AGM is bursting at the seams to contain this world, every trick and optimisation to cram the content in has been done, and you can almost hear the engine screaming in agony in the background as it works tirelessly to make this thing happen.\n\nIn a sense this would be akin to the times when games like Driller came out on the spectrum. Yes, you could push polygons and 3D rendering out on a computer with 128K of memory, but the poor thing creaked, and you could -hear- it creaking. People have asked if more content will be added, it might happen, but the engine is really being pushed here, so it'll be a case of hammering it in with a wedge in small chunks at a time I think.\n\nThis game almost certainly deserves to be a success beyond the developers most optimistic expectations, such that a sequel can happen, but it needs to happen in the same style, just in an engine that won't beg for mercy when they create this wonderful, vast canvas.\n\nA fine time to run out of ammo...\nThe combat deserves specific mention. I always felt games like Fallout 3 strayed too far towards "real time" combat, Dustbowl strikes a brilliant balance by being turn based with a reaction-ish based timing sequence for determining if you hit, crit, or miss. Weapons have their own distinct damage ranges, and your power in the game is strictly gear dependent (which means that progressing through the story will directly improve your ability to fight and also to defend yourself against the horrible nasty mutant things). The range of weapons is diverse, even at the early stages you'll find a goodly selection of pistols and assorted BB based weaponry, I can only assume it will escalate from there.\n\nA fine time to bleed pixels...\nThe art style is -very- retro. Going right back to VGA style RPG's of yore, but it works, evoking memories of Wasteland (the original, not even the remade original) and of similar games in that era. It's a very consistent art style, and the eye to design has been thoughtful and considered. The Subway (your first 'dungeon' area) is dingy and foreboding, and even though it's never explicitly threatening, there's always that nasty feeling you may be going a little too far from safety.\n\nFinal Thoughts...\nDustbowl came literally out of nowhere, and it's possibly been the most pleasant surprise this year to date. It's had no press, and no hype, and that's one of the greatest injustices I could possibly think of, because this is a terrible disservice to what is possibly one of the best RPG's outside of the AAA releases.\n\nVerdict : Essential.","May 18, 2015","true","3.6"," 113 of 130 people (87%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","87","113","130","3","9"

I'll update it as I get further into the game.\n\nThe game is a weird mixture of King's Quest, Wasteland (bit of Fallout in there too), Metro, etc but does a good job of being its own thing.\n\nCombat is simple but works well and actually involves a sense of timing.  You can target different parts of the body but unfortunately unlike Fallout you cannot kick a rat in the groin.  There's a somewhat Stalker-esque feel to scavenging.  There's even a decent crafting system.  I don't know what the depth of it is yet but I was able to make some extra survival gear pretty early on.\n\nPlaying with permadeath on i made it almost an hour in and was killed by a beetle in a subway office complex.  I should have turned back but decided to press on knowing what the consequences could be.  The game is not easy and so far seems to make you think about what supplies you have and how far you can go with them.\n\nThere's nothing I haven't seen before, but it's not about the ingredients, it's how you put them together.

Dustbowl feels like one of those games you can say "I played this a lot when I was a kid". It's like a great 90th game that was never released up until now. Sure some might not enjoy the minimalistic art, animation, combat and survival mechanic, but I did. The story is nice and interesting, it makes you want to play the game until the end. http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=624269345 http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=621801521 Unlocked all achievements!","February 15","true","10.9"," 20 of 22 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","20","22","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/drapocalypse/recommended/367110/","drapocalypse","Doctor ☢ Apocalypse","http://steamcommunity.com/id/drapocalypse/","238 products in account","If you enjoy old school adventure games I think you can get behind this title. I myself enjoy the retro visual style and throwback interface to older adventure games. The story and writing are ok, nothing spectacular but it’s far from dreadful. The post-apocalyptic setting and story are interesting and different enough from the rest to keep me intrigued on what happens next. The game world and quests are fairly large and so far I have had an abundance of objectives and missions to keep me busy.\n\nMy biggest complaint is how combat works and plays out. Most if not all encounters are random and combat is turn based. When you enter combat, it randomly (?) decides who has initiative, to attack you simply hit your attack button, a bar will fly across a multicolored slider bar, and you hit the attack button again to stop it. Based on where it stops and lands, it calculates the damage. It’s not horrible, but more often than not it just feels cheap and cheated.\n\nDespite the combat, this game offers a fairly rich and expansive adventure for the low cost of $9 usd. The old school interface, vfx and pacing will turn off some, but for those who grew up or enjoy that era of gaming, you will love this. You can tell the developers put their heart and soul into it and are influenced by many awesome games and movies like Fallout, Mad Max, Metro 2033, Stalker, Defiance, A Roadside Picnic.....the list goes on and on. I highly recommend it, easily one of my favorite indie titles of this year to date.","May 18, 2015","true","8.8"," 19 of 21 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","19","21","0","0"

I liked the story, I liked the combat system well enough: simple, not hard to understand, functional, and I even got very skilled at timing my critical hits.  I recommend it for what it is, an enjoyable few hours of story for what I paid ($8.00 if that matters).\n\nLong version:\nI've beaten the game and I can say that I enjoyed the story and the exploration.  I do however feel the need to make some things clear.  If they can be fixed I think that it will help in the long run.\n\nVery minor spoiler chances.\nTypos- Gonna start small here and, while it may seem petty to point them out, I was very impressed with how few misspellings I found.  The only glaring ones were Captain Moore's dialogue.  A misspelled 'usually' in the beginning and a 'theres' that should have been a 'there's'.\n\n"I have already backache."- This is the message you see when you open a chest that contains items your character will automatically pick up.  Typically you open a box and see what's inside and can take what you want (anything you don't take is lost.  You cannot store things other than in your sleeping quarter's storage chest, nor can you even reopen a box if you've closed it.)  In the case of certain containers, such as ones with new guns and ammo, if your encumbrance is high and it would overload you, you do not pick the items up and some of them may be lost.  Obviously it should be, "I already have a backache."\n\nQuests: All the quests seem to work and I was only unable to complete one, the Blood quest.  While it's possible I just never encountered any more, I have never found a single Blood Bag in an location or container other than in the Blood Bank at the hospital where the quest tells you to go.  The problem is that you likely find the hospital well before the quest-giver and have already looted the Blood Bags.  Since encumbrance is a huge part of the game and storage space is at a premium, it's likely that a player (like myself) will have used the Blood Bags to make Med-kits and find themselves unable to ever complete the quest, at least during that run. (I will restart a game and take care of that for the achievement.)\n\nPhantom NPCs- Many NPCs can be spotted if you mouse over a location where they either were or will be.  Two examples: The Engineer in front of the subway train, who can be spoken to and even given Machine Tools to complete his section of the Subway quest, even before placing the Automated Weapons Platform into position.  Also, Gordie and Rocksteady at the Gas Station.  They both can be spoken to even after freeing Luke and being constantly asked to pay a toll to pass even after doing so can be annoying.\n\nGraphic Glitches- Only a few places had glaring problems.  The hospital reception at St. Eligius, where the reception desk refuses to move above the avatar (also it's one of the first 'labeled' doors that doesn't actually go to another room, which was also confusing at first.  On the upper floor of the hospital, returning to the elevator the avatar refuses to move anywhere in the room (though clicking the elevator allows acces so it isn't game-breaking.)\n\nThe other glitch was in the Epicenter of the Dustbowl in one of the Straights rooms.  If you encounter an enemy there (a Hanging Cirrus in both cases for me where I encountered the glitch) you avatar ends up under the room and the enemy above.  The fight proceeds as normal and you can move on after winning, which shouldn't be that tough be the time you're that far in the game.\n\nMerchants-This game features a vendor system that randomizes item prices for merchants.  Unfortunately this system is of little value to the game.  Say you want to buy a Canteen of Water.  The vendor wants 50 dollars, Exit, re-click the vendor, now she wants 52.  Exit, re-click, now she wants 45.  Items seem to have an 8 to 10 dollar variance range.  Not much when they're asking 150 for a Med-kit but very noticable when you're buying Ball Bearing for ammo and one second they cost 1 dollar and then next they cost 8 dollars.  It need to either be fixed at flat rates universally or have the prices set for some amount of time (even then I would just Save and Reload before checking vendor).  Otherwise I just click and exit until I see the Ball Bearing at 1 dollar before buying them.\n\nItem prices-You will find yourself selling a good many items.  Typically, when you select an item and hover it over the 'Sell' area of a vendor you will see the item's value.  A few items are listed as having an incorrect value, typically in the player's favor.  Notable items are: Ball Bearings/Pneumatic Ammo (sell value 2, actual 4), Tourniquet (sell value 1, actual 2), and Crow Feathers (sell value 1, actual 2).  Not a huge deal for the most part except see below.\n\nUnlimited Money-Woo hoo!  Here's the thing, when you combine the fact that you can buy Ball Bearings for 1 dollar easily enough and then sell them for 4 dollars (even though they're listed as selling for 2) then you get unlimited money limited only to how many times you want to click the mouse button.  Spend $100 on 100 Bearings, Sell them and have $400, Buy 100 more Bearings, etc.  Then buy 5 Multitools with the money and you're all set.  (You might need more than 5 for the whole game, but barely and never for more than one outing from the base, so for Encumbrance purposes, 5 is enough.)  I went out with 10 myself, but now we both know.\n\nI think with a patch of a few things, it can be a little better but, in conclusion, this game is simple, it's fun, and the story is done well enough for what it is.  Save early, save often and things like random encounters and weird containers shouldn't trouble you overly much.","May 22, 2015","true","26.8"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","1"

Enemies hit with critical hits more than misses, they have armor while you don't, drop almost nothing of use and rob you of more than half your health and with almost no way to heal up. I can understand the prospect of a difficult game, but the risk versus reward for this games combat is awful, and their is almost no chance to avoid or escape it.\n\nEdit: I have complete it, and while the difficulty does go down further on, I would like the option to run from fights. Some battles have no rewards and are just a massive waste of resources.\n\nStorage quickly becomes a problem too, as only 16 slots does not facilitate enough space for everything you may need.\n\nWeight capacity of 35 Kg is not enough if you want a Flamethrower, as .2 Kg of fuel is consumed per use, making both the flamethrower and it's fuel way too heavy for anything practical.\n\nThe Maching Parts weight is also too high, being a full Kg, meaning that crafting with them is harder than needs to be.\n\nBasically, there are lots of off balance mechanics that could use tweaking, and make the game a lot more enjoyable, but after the early game hell, the story certianly drew me in, and that was what allowed me to complete the game.\n\nSo if your focus is story, then I can recommend this game.","May 18, 2015","true","22.2"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","13","17","0","9"

I cut the review into segments so you can easily find the information you need.\n\nStory\n\nThe story is a straightforward one but it's well written and you get multiple dialogue choices with the many unique characters you meet.\n\nThe game features a good amount of main and side content, locations to explore, and some of the side quests are so well made they almost feel like\nthe main storyline.\n\nGraphics\n\nThe game uses an older pixel style graphics than Fallout or some other indie games, The games interface and pixel style remind me of Maniac mansion or other point and click games of that era (although the interface in Dustbowl is easier to navigate).\n\nCharacters have well-drawn avatars and their pixel versions have mouths that open and shut (manic mansion style). I didn't like the Overland maps laggy style of movement but I understand why its done like that (most older games were this way like the older Ultimas).\n\nSound\n\nThe sound effects are made to sound similar to games from that time so they aren't the best but they get the job done and you begin to not really notice anything wrong with them.\n\nGeneral\n\nUnfortunately character customization at the start of the game is virtually nonexistant, but you can select from pre-made avatars.\n\nThere is a large assortment of dangers, other than monsters, ghouls and other creepy enemies, such as starvations, dehydration and radiation poisoning.\n\nIf you are attacked by certain enemies you get a bleeding status effect that requires bandages otherwise you slowly lose health until you die.\n\nThere is a large assortment of weapons and equipment, from melee to ranged weaponry.

This game is basically a different take on Fallout but instead of a turn/grid-based strategy RPG it's more based around point-and-click style wandering and a minigame of a combat system. The game looks great in terms of pixel art. The intro and the characters are interesting. The game is a huge homage to Fallout in my opinion but I Can Not Stand the combat.\n\nThe Only problem I have with this game and the Only reason I haven't played more than two hours is the combat system. The entirety of combat is just a slow-paced meter minigame where a line slides across a bar and you have to stop the line as close as possible to the center to get a hit in. And enemies will randomly spawn in rooms that you've already gone through so if want to backtrack to another room because you found a fuse for a generator you have to shoot down new enemies. And it's not like you get experience or anything from killing enemies. All you get is some random drops and the Priviledge to continue playing the game. It's terrible.\n\nIf the combat is updated to be quicker or something is changed then Stellar, I'm gonna not stop playing this game. But right now this second I can not recommend this game unless you're an ace at the game's minigame combat system.

The game's one misgiving is easily out shined by the game's over all fun and awesome style. The pixel art is great, and the ambient sounds are generally pretty good. The combat itself is simplistic but not easy, and it has a certain rhythm to it that really works once you get used to it.\n\nThe game very much does not hold your hand and early on its easy to wander in the 'wrong' direction and get into trouble. (This isn't a bad thing!) After I was forced to restart I found my second attempt at the game a lot easier, once I knew where things were on the map, but I definitely felt like I had earned it. (It was awesome to make my own map on paper, haven't done that in years.)\n\nThat does bring up my only gripe with the game. The developers using a particular engine called AGS, and apparently every time they update it corrupts all previous saves. This isn't really acceptable in my opinion. The developers recommended not updating until you were ready, but like many people, I have steam set to auto-update.\n\nDespite this, I still recommend the game.

So now I'm dedicating an hour to each of these games and writing a series of One Hour Reviews. An hour isn't very long to judge a game on, so think of this as more of a first impression, and take this review in the spirit in which it's given. Be sure to read other reviews from players who have spent more time in the game.\n\nOne Hour Reviews #53 - Dustbowl\n\nDustbowl is an interesting mix of a point-and-click adventure game and an old-school RPG.  I spent my first few minutes exploring my room and picking up various items left lying around.  But the game quickly introduces it's first RPG elements as I encounter people and having conversations.  Conversations are your classic multiple choice, without any fancy branching dialog options that I saw.  It seems like most folks are there to hand out quests, so early on I ended up with quite a few tasks to help out with, on top of the main questline.\n\nThe graphics are very retro, which for the most part works just fine.  But you may be disappointed by the complete lack of graphics options, as you are forced to play in a window at a locked resolution.  That didn't really both me, but my main complaint is some of the fonts used in the game are pretty small and hard to read at times.  Thankfully the small font isn't used in conversations, so it's not something you have to deal with frequently.\n\nThe interface is fairly basic.  The screen is split into 2 major areas, with the top area rendering your character and surroundings.  In the bottom area, you have 3 tabs that you can switch between your inventory, your characer status, and your list of jobs.  It feels a little clunky but it works.  Sometimes things aren't entirely intuitive.  For instance, I tried to use a medpack by clicking on it, and then clicking on my character.  That didn't work, and I figured out later I had to click on the hand icon to use it.  It may take you a bit to pick up on how to do things.   Also little things you might expect like hitting Escape to bring up the options menu don't work.  Instead you have to click an icon at the top right that doesn't really look like something you'd expect to open a menu.\n\nCombat is turn-based, but rather than using random numbers to determine if you hit or not, instead it plays out as a mini game.  You have 3 zones representing a miss, a hit, or a critical hit.  Depending on the timing of your click, your shot will end up in one of these 3 areas and do damage accordingly.\n\nI wouldn't call the difficulty punishing, but Dustbowl does not do any hand holding for you either.  You have 3 bars that you have to manage, one for health, one for food, and one for drink.  You start out pretty much broke, so it's up to you to scavenge and manage your inventory well.  Also, you don't automatically heal when you aren't in combat.  You do get some health back after sleeping (once you are tired; it doesn't let you just randomly take a nap), but mostly you are relying on items to heal yourself.  When you die, your only option is to reload your last save, which thankfully Dustbowl lets you save pretty much anytime.\n\nI spent most of my first hour running around the starting area before I ended up outside for the first time.  At this point I was presented with an overland map that felt right out of the original Wasteland game.  So I spent the last little bit of my playthrough exploring the surrounding area and getting into a few random encounters (which aren't always fights).\n\nI had fun with Dustbowl and like it for what it is.  Some folks may be turned off by the old school gameplay, but I found it enjoyable and worth the price.","March 25","true","1.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Keep that in mind)\n\n\nThe Atmosphere first of all is something that I look for in all my games. Dustbowl has the same mystery that the zone in S.T.A.L.K.E.R. (albeit to a smaller scale).\n\nCombat is simple to learn but difficult to master. It will quickly become second nature to score critical hits, but the true skill comes from heat/heart shots. You will learn that each part of the body may or may not be armored and you should  make certain to take note of that.\n\nLocations on the map will quickly draw you to the extreme edges to find out the secrets of the Dustbowl. It gives a similar feel to when you leave the vault for the first time in Fallout 1 (or the camp in Fallout 2): Pick a direction and start exploring.\n\nThe story right now does feel a little condensed, but there are plans to expand and flesh it out in the near future (speaking from late May '15). But the plot and quests that are set in place now are solid.\n\nDustbowl, to me, is a great game with plenty more to come in the future.","May 29, 2015","true","30.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

It's a turn-based battle system, but it really just seems like not a lot of work was put into making this game. There's difficult in that it's very tactical and challenging, and then there's difficult in that it just wasn't put together well. This is the ladder. It's got a really cool idea, but it doesn't tell you enough of what to do, and for a game that's supposed to be story-based rather than survival/open-world, this game doesn't work very well.

Altohugh not all of them were solved, there were far less later on in the game. The fact that a developer responed is also a good thing. And in the end, I really (see under) LOVE this game. Remind me to not write a review in frustration.\nBUY THIS GAME NOW. It's great, just look past a few glitches. And at this price... shouldn't complain.\n\n\n\n\nFirst review:\nI really, really LOVE this game. But for now... it is not a finished game. Every 5-15 minutes something goes wrong. Mostly crashes due to inventory failures or doors that I am apparently not supposed to open. No reason to crash. A message pops up after the crashes to report to the programmers... god luck in finding out how!\nThen there are many items that turn red (which means they are somehow useable), but are not. Now if this happened 2 or 3 times... ok. But in 2 hours of play I've had 8 complete crashes of the game and some 10 other occurences as 'red' items that cannot be used. Feels very much in beta to me. Great potential, but unfinished. :-(","May 23, 2015","true","17.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"
