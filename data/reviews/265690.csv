"http://steamcommunity.com/id/More_Badass/recommended/265690/","More_Badass","More_Badass","http://steamcommunity.com/id/More_Badass/","624 products in account","Thirty minutes in:\nSo I'm about thirty minutes into NaissanceE and it's as atmospheric and otherworldly as you might have hoped. The environments are expansive, monolithic, not in terms of being open to exploration but in terms of sheer scale. You feel small, lost and utterly alone in this world. It's a world that feels alien and weird, not in the twisty Escher-esque sense that Antichamber had, but like you just don't belong in this place. Even though it isn't a horror game, there's a distinct feeling of tension and apprehension of the unknown, and the unsettling sound effects add to this. It's been a linear journey so far, but I don't mind that. It's a world I want to venture further into and discover more about.\n--\nTwo hours in:\n2 hours into the game and it continues to impress. There have been a few challenging platforming sections interspersed between the traversal and light puzzle solving, but for the most part, it's all about the experience. Some might say it's boring, too much walking, but if there's one thing the game has excelled at since the start, it's making you feel small, insignificant within the massive alien spaces. That has been the highlight for me, just traveling through this mysterious complex. You exit from a narrow corridor into a gargantuan space that makes you tense just looking over the edge, and then you realize you have to find a way down. The game doesn't hold your hand, doesn't direct you where to go, besides the visual environmental cues. The game is certainly linear, don't expect a sprawling world, but you do have to find your way and it's easy to get disoriented, lost, turned around. The game has a fantastic atmosphere: mysterious, engaging, ominous, otherworldly.\n\nAs for negatives, there's one mechanic that at the moment feels more extraneous than integral to the overall experience. It complicates a simple action, and while it kind of feels almost Receiver-esque in the sense that you have to focus on an action that is usually automatic, I don't think it has really added anything to the gameplay yet. One platforming section was quite frustrating and I ended up just turning up the gamma to complete it. Also I found some checkpoints can be bit too spread out, but that's only been an issue two or three times.\n--\nThree hours in:\nThe developer said that the game's four to five hours long, but I'm thinking that's only if you know exactly where to go, how to go there, not die (repeatedly). I'm still on the second chapter. Probably should shave about twenty minutes of my overall play time, because I got stuck on a puzzle with a solution that was annoyingly obvious once I figured out what I was overlooking\n\nMy gripe about the checkpoints still stand. Some of them are just too spread out. You'll do some difficult platforming, get a safe area, start another difficult section, die, and then the checkpoint is back at the start of that first section. While you're just traveling and exploring, it's not an issue, but once you're dealing with sections where you can die because of a missed jump after making some progress, it can be frustrating.\n\nBut despite this issue (or at least I consider it an issue), the game has not lost any of its luster or mystery. I think the world in this game is by far one of the most alien and atmospheric I've experienced. It's not alien in the way that Avatar's world was, but alien in the unsettling sense that this is truly not a place made for or by humans.\n\nNew mechanics are introduced, mainly to offer interesting platforming and puzzle scenarios. It's great when you just have to stop and admire some cool sight, and NaissanceE has had moment after moment like that so far. The sound effects are as well great, really adding a sense of place and tone.\n---\nSeven hours in:\nYeah, 7 hours and I finally reached Breath Compression. I guess me, first person platforming, and keyboard/mouse controls don't mix well.\n\nBut I'm still absolutely loving this game. It does something very well, that I've usually only experienced in sprawling open world games and it's the feeling of seeing something interesting in the distance and then after 10, 15, 20 minutes of traveling, turning the corner and seeing that landmark before you. NaissanceE accomplishes that so well, enticing the player with weird and intriguing architecture and structures far away and then later, you exit a corridor and you're there.\n\nIt's a great feeling, that makes the game seem less like a linear adventure and more a journey where you're discovering the path. You never feel pushed or pulled in a direction, the game never takes control of your camera to direct you or tell you to head that way or in this direction. It's masterful in that aspect, subtly driving the player forward not through objective markers or compass arrows but with cues in the environment and the reward of exploration and discovery.\n\nNow while the game is linear, it's certainly not tight corridors. Many areas have surprised me with how open they are, and all have been interesting to explore and just be in. Beside the exploration aspect, the gameplay seems to favor more platforming over puzzles, with a few light based puzzles and several challenging platforming areas.","February 12, 2014","true","8.0"," 248 of 266 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","248","266","0","4"

Aesthetically, it's perfect. A dark, forbidding, brutalist world to explore. I've lost count of the times I've just been stunned by the game's architecture, and stopped to look around.\n\nUnfortunately, here are some other things I've lost count of:\nThe amount of times I've died and thought 'Really? There hasn't been a checkpoint for THIS LONG?'\nThe amount of times, a few seconds after I respawn or load in, the game has frozen for a second (this happens every time).\nThe amount of times I've been able to see through walls while moving quickly - and come on, this shouldn't happen in a game with textures this simple, should it?\nThe amount of times I've been killed because of how poorly the character movement controls and how short a drop can kill you in this game.\nThe amount of times I've foolishly tried to use the Steam overlay, which crashes the game for me every single time.\n\nAside from actual glitches which I hope will be ironed out in an update, the gameplay itself simply doesn't help. The proportion of the game spent trying to complete absurd platforming challenges instead of being allowed to explore this fascinating environment is unbearable. As for the puzzles, they're essentially fine, but as previously mentioned, falling off a ledge halfway through them is pretty un-fun. And then there's the weird breathing mechanic, which frankly adds nothing to the game.\n\nWhat ultimately stopped me from wanting to continue with the game at all was a section where the player is expected to walk along a lengthy pipe, parts of which are  rotating, others of which move up and down - in what appears to be a wind tunnel. In the particular part of the pipe I was up to, you first have to walk along a series of moving, floating cubes to reach the next section. Then you have to run past some rotating obstacles. Then you have to run along another section with a series of cubes being thrown at you which instantly kill you if you are hit. Then you have to run along some beams that move up and down. Then you die, because a gust of wind has at some point during the aforementioned series of challenges, picked you up and blown you away. Why does this happen? Not sure. How is the player expected to know when the wind is going to become dangerous to them? Don't know. What is the player supposed to do to survive this? No idea. Sometimes the wind simply blows you into a wall, which doesn't hurt, but the wind seemingly never stops once it begins, so you're forced to re-load a save anyway.\n\nIf I'm missing something blindingly obvious here I apologise, but at the moment I have to treat this game as simply being broken.\n\nI can't emphasise enough how much I love the way this game looks and sounds. It really makes you feel small, and the abstract electronic music complements that feeling perfectly. It's just a shame that a game so seemingly great should be so keen with its gameplay to stop me from playing it ever again. NaissanceE is a beautiful art game trapped inside an alpha-release standard puzzle-platformer.\n\nUPDATE: So with this review climbing up the store page a bit, felt it was worth updating. I've played a bit more of the game since my initial review, having FINALLY managed to progress beyond that awful platform section. Apparently, the fan automatically blows you away after a certain amount of time, not just at random. I don't know how you're supposed to know this, but there it is. I made it through the area in time, EVENTUALLY.\n\nAnyway, the couple of levels after that have actually been fairly simple and enjoyable (and, it goes without saying, aesthetically impressive). I got up to the desert section and haven't played more since, but at this point, the game is no longer throwing ♥♥♥♥ in my face constantly, so I feel like I will continue and finish the game when I have time. For this reason, and a couple of others, I'm changing my review to a cautious recommendation.\n\nThe other reasons are that 1: the developer has announced plans to fix bugs and include more checkpoints in the next patch, which would be a great improvement, and 2: the developer has made clear that the platforming sections were 'old-school' and difficult by choice, not accidentally. And if it's a design choice, I can't exactly treat the game as broken.\n\nSo it's a reserved recommendation - if you're a fan of atmospheric exploration games, pick this up but be aware that there'll be some real challenges (hopefully more reasonably checkpointed in future) to struggle through unless you're a master platformer. And if you're looking for a hardcore platformer, maybe pick this up but be aware there's a lot of wandering around lost in-between.","February 14, 2014","true","4.8"," 77 of 84 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","77","84","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/recommended/265690/","maudish","Audish","http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/","908 products in account","Do you remember the feeling you got when you saw the strange, grand architecture of Cloud City in The Empire Strikes Back? Or the impossibly huge geometry of V'ger in Star Trek: The Motion Picture? Or the cityscape in Blade Runner? Well, NaissanceE will bring back that feeling with incredible intensity.\n\nNo other game does grand environments like this, I promise you. It's mind-bogglingly huge and familiar and alien all at once, and when you start moving around it you realize that yes, you can get to that bright point on the horizon, it's not just scenery. It's a linear game but the city-type environments are surprisingly open, with optional paths to find here and there. The sound design does an amazing job of supporting the atmosphere, bouncing you between slack-jawed wonder and a creeping unease.\n\nThe catch is that's only about half the game.\n\nThe other half is split between claustrophobic halls and cubist nightmares. There are a lot of surreal, nonsensical rooms to run through that don't really mesh all that well with the cityscapes they break up. Chapters 5 and 6 (the game is broken into seamless Half-Life-style chapters) seem to double down on the weirdness, which was a little disappointing because of how much I enjoyed the city bits. The puzzles are also rather hit or miss, generally being rather easy and not very clever. I will say that there are some jumping puzzles in Chapter 4 that were pretty frustrating in how little sense they made, and an eye-searing puzzle in Chapter 5 that almost made me quit the game entirely.\n\nThe second-to-last chapter is pretty interesting and very wide open. It makes me think there's even more to find in the game, though there's no real payoff for exploration besides seeing what other weirdness the world contains. The last chapter is a little frustrating until you figure out what it wants you to do and the ending is pretty blah. I think there's something deep going on with the story but I haven't picked up on it. I just feel like there's something there. I honestly think the atmosphere is good enough to justify the purchase, but be aware there are more than a few flaws.","September 25, 2015","true","3.6"," 63 of 66 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","63","66","0","0"

Hidden in the loud and ever-changing steam library, this beauty rests. Unlike most games that I play, NaissanceE was one of the first that moved me. It truly shows how digital experiences like NaissanceE are becoming an art.\nFirst things first, NiassanceE is absolutely beautiful. French game developer Mavros Sedeno has a great eye for design, style and lighting. The numerous worlds you explore in NaissanceE are absolutely amazing, and it is obvious that the developer put a lot of time into creating them. The music choices and sound design in NaissanceE are two of the main components of the game’s dark atmosphere, making the experience much more immersive. The strange machine universe of NaissanceE feels so...alien. I always wonder why things were built and the absence of life. But for some reason, this feeling of loneliness is almost comforting. The long sterile hallways or the enormous underground cities can create a calming atmosphere when pared with the subtle instrumental soundtrack. The experience still sticks in my mind even when finishing the game a long time ago. The story isn’t very direct. Everything that takes place in NaissanceE is really up to your imagination, The experience could be different for everyone. I personally think that the world of NaissanceE is a version of hell, and that the fragments of human civilization could relate to memories of the protagonist. I mean, the name of the game means “birth” in french, so the game’s ending could mean the escape of hell into life once again. I just feel like the story is very phycological. I am not religious at all, so I don’t know many of the stories, but it could be a re-creation of one too.\nNaissanceE isn’t a game for everyone. The type of storytelling in NaissanceE is very subtle and ambiguous, containing no dialogue or characters to lead the way (Very much like LIMBO). Personally, I really enjoy this way to tell a story since the experience can be much more interesting when your imagination tells the story. There isn’t really anything in NaissanceE that is mature, only that when you get hurt blood lines circle your vision for a period of time. The game does simulate intense themes, such as insanity, but nothing really direct. NaissanceE also has a haunting feeling at times, but only to create a better atmosphere. Although, you need a very powerful PC to play it, so just a heads-up to the people who have one. I really want the developer to get the support he deserves for creating such an amazing game.","November 7, 2014","true","37.3"," 69 of 78 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","69","78","3","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Cheesecake_Recipe/recommended/265690/","Cheesecake_Recipe","A Victim of Stars","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Cheesecake_Recipe/","882 products in account","NaissanceE hits the ground running – or rather, its protagonist does. The opening moments serve as a compressed summary of all that the player is about to experience. Disoriented, panting, lungs pumping air like every moment could be their last. Rows and rows of identical hallways swoosh past. Are the walls really shrinking in on us or is it just a trick of the camera? A glimpse of the assailant giving chase causes the pace to quicken, accentuated by a sickening electronic noise trill. Before long, we come face to face with the creature just moments before falling into a pit that carries us to safety. Safety being relative. As the world we’re introduced to is anything but friendly and familiar.\n\nIn a way it’s the older brother of Kairo, one who transitioned from Eno to Lucier while attending college. Second cousin twice removed to Antichamber, losing almost all of its puzzle genes while retaining the mind-twisting level design. NaissanceE stands proudly next to other modern takes on the puzzle adventure. Progression, while linear, always fits within the massive scope of any particular area. You’ll get lost in the larger maps, poking around in the corners feebly in hopes of finding direction or a sign of life. What plot there is to be told is presented entirely through the environmental clues left behind by whoever came before you. There’s no dialog to be heard, no monologuing audio diaries or scraps of paper to pick up. The only text ever seen is the chapter titles and the main menu options. Everything remains a mystery.\n\nMost of the time is spent simply navigating the large maps with occasional platforming segments to break things up. A breathing mechanic comes into play while sprinting for a short time. Every few seconds while sprinting, a circle will appear on screen. Hitting the right button (defaults to Mouse 1) while the circle is there will make your character take a breath and they will continue running a little longer. Fail to do so and they become winded and slow down drastically. Not something you want happening in the large maps or while jumping from cube to cube. On the note of platforming, I found some of the sequences to be irksome. Some involving awkwardly shaped landing areas and altered physics took me out of the moment if only briefly. I feel like the game could have been better off without those or with a little more care taken with them. You’ll also get to play with some cubes that are sensitive to light sources for a few puzzles, but none of them are particularly difficult.\n\nNaissanceE expertly grasps the concepts behind what makes lonesome wandering compelling. The lights are on but nobody’s home. An expansive view of an area could show thousands of lit windows though you never get the sense that anyone is ever sitting behind them. A few poorly spaced checkpoints and unintuitive platforming segments annoy but don’t detract from the overall experience. As challenging of a play as it is a listen, your hand is never held in the labyrinth. The atmosphere is stifling, mysterious, beautiful. I felt compelled to explore as much as I could even if I knew there was a dead end ahead. In the 5 hours it took me to reach the incredible last moments I remained entranced.\n\nThough, I don’t really know what it all means.\n\nAnd it terrifies me.","February 12, 2014","true","9.8"," 67 of 79 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","67","79","0","2"

By some accounts there may also be some bugs with the various "windy" locations that make the game nigh-on unplayable in places, but I personally never encountered any of those problems.\n\nSpecial mention needs to go to the completely pointless side corridor that warns you "not to continue this way", and when you (of course) *DO* continue in that direction the game eventually just unceremoniously quits to desktop.\n\nHa. Ha. Funny. *sigh*\n\nAlso, unless I missed something (which is very possible) don't expect any sort of payoff or even an ending to the game. Upon reaching the end you just get dropped back to the main menu with nary an explanation of what just happened or why.\n\n* * *\n\nIn the end, I personally have a particular love of exploring strange, alien places and abandoned locale's in games, so I still feel like I got my moneys worth out of it. The visuals and sound design feels like a modern interpretation of an ancient long-lost Lovecraftian cityscape.\n\nBUT unless you can be equally forgiving of some incredibly bad "game" elements then I'd suggest you steer clear or wait for a sale.\n\nTwo wibbly wobbly cuboid snake monsters out of five.\n\n","February 16, 2014","false","4.0"," 60 of 71 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","60","71","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AestheticGamer/recommended/265690/","AestheticGamer","AestheticGamer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AestheticGamer/","3606 products in account","Lasting about 3-5 hours, NaissanceE is a surreal exploration puzzle game that is appropriately atmospheric and moody, strange and surreal, sometimes puzzling and confusing, but most of the time something that feels like a trip into a strange, foreign, isolated world that runs by its own rules, rules that you have to figure out to progress and survive.\n\nOnly the most abstract of plots exists in the games; You start off the game running from some sort of shadow thing, and fall down to what can easily be compared to the rabbit hole. Your only given slight clues of a narrative, mostly coming from the chapters titles themselves, but the story is fairly simple... Lucy, our character, needs to go down deeper into this abyss and figure out what's down there. However, even without a strict narrative, the game manages to have a lot of personality and engagement. The loose narrative structure, surrealism, strange tripping moments, slight yet odd puzzle solving, and the strange world run by its own rules, remind me a lot of something like Yume Nikki or LSD: Dream Emulator, while it's a very different sort of game than either of those it in many instances can give off a similar otherworldly feel, and like those games, a strange inner-joy to try and explore and learn what you can about this strange, foreign, yet somewhat familiar place,\n\nOne super minor complaint is that I thought it'd be interesting if the game had developed more of its mechanics further, the game has the tendency to introduce an interesting concept and keep that concept to but a single section of the game, and never mixes and matches concepts like it could. However, the sheer number of ideas on display, how they're handled and presented, and how many of them strike the mark and work, more than make up for it, and also helps in the element of always guessing what may be coming next.\n\nBesides that, the only complaint I have comes from a few moments. What you're supposed to do and where you're supposed to go is sometimes kind of obtuse, there's a few instances of trying to figure out what is the correct course of action to move forward that feels less puzzle solving and either trying to spot some obscure passage you missed or a guessing game with little hint, but again, minor in the grand scheme of things. There is one instance involving a wind tunnel and fans that I found to be a bit too trial and error, and sort of forced you to learn the breathing mechanic timing the character has while running to progress. There are some sequences the game turns more into a timed platformer, and these segments are notably weaker than the times the game moves at a slower pace, while I didn't find these segments bad, it is of note that they did strike less with me than most of the other sections of the game.\n\nThe game has several secrets to find, which were a joy to look for and uncover. Each of the chapters felt very different without breaking the flow of the game to what we learned before.\n\nThe flaws the game has are minor because the experience during its 3-5 hour run time is thoroughly gripping, strange, yet interesting, atmospheric, a sense of alone, sometimes dips into madness, and I'd even dare to say at times magical. It's a game that managed to capture a series of raw emotions of me whole playing with no dialogue or concrete story. It made me think deeply about things in the human psyche as I questioned my interpretations of things by mere suggestion, it can sometimes be mind-bending in the best possible way, and despite its short length, managed to be gripping from beginning to end. I'd say completely worth it for those who want to take a trip into a strange, interesting world.","April 20, 2015","true","4.5"," 47 of 52 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","47","52","0","0"

From the reviews I read, it seemed like it had enough to fit that bill. But in honesty it felt lacking to me.\n\nIt’s labelled quite clearly an “exploration” game, which that within itself is probably where my fault lies. You do explore surreal and abstract settings, but bar a very few odd bits and puzzles here and there, that is about it. The label “walking simulator” has been a tad bit controversial but if I had to label this game anything, it’d be that.\n\nAs far as I am aware, there is no story. It clues you in at the start that you’re a little girl and you’re lost. But if I’m remembering correctly that is pretty much it in terms of anything being handed to you. You can make of it what you will, and at times I love that kind of thing, but I don’t think they built much of a foundation for you to go off of.\n\nThe world in itself is massive. Or at least, it feels that way. Which, props to them, that’s what you want in an exploration game! But here is the catch: the world is pretty minimal and barren. This probably doesn’t apply to the people with more than four brain cells to rub together to create an attention span, but for me I was in awe with my surroundings for 5-10 minutes or so before I got bored of the emptiness and wanted to move on to the next setting.\n\nIt almost feels as if you spend half of the game within tight corridors and small spaces and the other half in massive open spaces. The changing between the two is quite nice as it switches things up a little, but for me both still had that empty, minimal and barren feeling to it.\n\nTraversing the very big and barren surroundings you found yourself in was made more difficult by the fact you have to control your characters breathing whilst running.\nDon’t get me wrong, I was and still am quite impressed by the originality of that feature and how they incorporated it into the more lively bits of the game. But taking 5 minutes to get up a staircase or being dumped into a massive desert and having to turtle your way around a massive world looking for what the hell to do next, wasn’t made any more fun with your character constantly needing you to click the mouse so she’d remember to breathe.\n\nWith all that said, I think the thing I was disappointed most about was the lack of puzzles. Again, it’s not labelled a puzzle game so I can’t moan too much. But I think some more puzzles in this game would have given it a lot more substance and made it a lot more enjoyable as well as bringing out its full potential as a game. “Kairo” for one being an example of that. It too is an abstract and surreal first person game with little direction or story. But in Kairo the puzzles are challenging and impressive enough to redeem the game. Or at least that was my opinion.\n\nBut alas! I feel like I’m moaning a lot here, so how about some positivity?\n\nThe graphics in this game are wonderful, it really is a beautiful game to look at and I was quite impressed with the art style. If this game has any redeeming qualities, the graphics are definitely it.\n\nAs I mentioned before, despite the breathing being a little tedious at times, it was impressive. Certain chapters of the game were very reliant on you being able to control your breathing to get by and the concept being used in that way was great. It bought out the games potential a little bit and made moments that were supposed to induce fear actually make you worry. I must have gotten through 90% of the game cool as a cucumber. Then the very last chapter had me genuinely scared and my heart going ten to the dozen. Which I can’t lie, I loved!\n\nAll in all this game is a nice experience, but I don’t feel like it has much to it. You can think of it what you will, but when I weigh up the pros and cons for myself, if I were to ask myself if it was worth sinking 6 hours into I’d have to reluctantly say no.\nNone the less, feel free to experience it for yourself! This isn’t a resounding “NO”. It’s not like I feel obliged to warn you about the forthcoming horror that awaits before you if you buy this game. If anything this is a just-teetering-over-the-line-towards-a-no kind of no.\n\n\nTL;DR : This game is a walking simulator if anything, with no apparent story, minimal and barren surroundings and not much in terms of puzzle or challenge. Redeeming features if any being the graphics, which are beautiful and a unique feature, which includes you needing to control your breathing, which could have been used to bring out the games full potential. That being said, it’s a nice experience but in my opinion not one worth £10 and 6 hours playtime.","December 27, 2015","false","6.2"," 60 of 81 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","60","81","0","5"

In the early parts of the game, you find yourself wanting to hide from nothing more than light and shadows moving about in an indescribably sinister way. In the midgame, there's an astonishing underground city, which brings to mind Blade Runner, Brazil, with a bit of 2001 thrown in.\n\nAnd then it suddenly turns into a frustrating "hurry up before you die" platformer, where there's no exploration, and you have to struggle even to reach the next checkpoint. If you get past that section of the game, it wanders even further afield, losing all sense of the atmosphere and enjoyment with which it started. Which is REALLY, REALLY disappointing -- I very much wanted to play the endgame that the first half of this game was hinting at, a steady progression into Antichamber-like distortions of reality. But it lost sight of that goal, and lost me in the process. So as brilliant as the beginning is, I can't recommend this game because it just doesn't follow through on its initial promise.","March 23, 2015","false","7.0"," 42 of 53 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","42","53","0","0"

The rooms and the glimpses of the epic proportions of the structure you can catch throughout the game are nothing short of breathtaking. This fascination for the rooms you traverse is accompanied by a weird sense of fear and wonder. You can never quite tell wether this place you seem to be lost in served a purpose at some point or not. Whenever you are presented with rooms that seemingly make sense, the game loves to go downright crazy and throws you into a strobelit nightmare-void. Did I mention that you hear all kinds of noises and music that ranges from eerie foreboding to almost silly and quite uplifting? It is mostly moody though, giving the game a somewhat dark undertone. Fitting the massive but strangely empty complex.\n\nThe game is light on puzzles, but features a sort of lite version  of "Mirror's Edge"-gameplay. You will run and jump. A lot (and die too!). You will also control your breathing while doing so, or otherwise stop running after a couple of meters - which might not be good for you in certain situations. The breathing-mechanic feels a bit arbitrary to be honest, but it might serve a point of making you feel like you are not controlling a floating camera.\n\nWether or not NaissanceE has an actual story or meaning I cannot say (which might be good thing actually, no dangers of getting annoyed by pretentiousness), but it managed to get my wanderlust going and explore ever deeper into the megastructure to see what its architects have come up with. In a sense, this place is about the road AND the destination at the same time - and that's really cool.\n\nThis is the kind of experience that books, movies or paintings can hint at - but being there and living through all the sights and sounds in person is entirely different. And it is pretty awesome too. Highly recommended if you are looking for something different.","November 30, 2014","true","3.9"," 20 of 23 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","20","23","0","2"

There may be secrets, and I'd like to hear about them, but I don't know if I found any. The enormous scale of surreal architecture is great to explore.\n\nThe downsides are that you can't see your feet, you don't have a cursor to aim where you are jumping, and the checkpoints are SUPER annoying in places.  One section had an unskippable cutscene of almost exactly 2 minutes, every time you died.  There were  maybe 1-2 hours that I think could be cut completely. This section mostly consists of crazy shader effects where the difficulty comes of not being able to see anything.\n\nThere was another interesting normal section in a couple of cool environments, and then a final really annoying sequence with crappy checkpoints (and jumps you apparently can't complete if your computer isn't running near the full 60 fps rate since the Steam discussion forums mention that the wind physics are broken with lower framerate, fun times!). There is literally no ending, nor even any credits as far as I can tell, since the game kicks you back to the main menu.\n\nI would say maybe 6.5/10. The art and exploration were great and I imagine would be awesome with the Oculus Rift. On the flip side, the horrible sections with flashing lights, or crazy shaders, or near complete darkness, would be even WORSE. I would probably not recommend it at $20, maybe $10 unless you absolutely love the architecture.","February 15, 2014","false","7.8"," 25 of 34 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","25","34","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/265690/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","NaissanceE is a game of light and shadows, or at least that's what it wants you to think it is. In reality it's a little harder to describe; an experience constantly evolving, that at it's core doesn't quite fit into any one genre. It's a game about exploration; about discovery and self interpretation that requires you to find your own way and make sense of your surroundings without the funneling and hand-holding we have become accustomed to. It's an incredibly ambitious project for such a small development team, one with numerous jaw dropping moments and incredible artistic direction, but it's abundance of anomalous design decisions and a handful of seemingly minor but highly frustrating problems leaves it hanging somewhere in the middle of "fully recommended" and "proceed with caution."\n\nNaissanceE is in essence an art project with scraps of gameplay taped to it at odd angles. Making your way through the alien structure you find yourself in is largely a hands-off journey, but for what it lacks in interactivity is made up for by the sheer amount of visual and audio stimulation. The architecture is incredible in scope, from massive chasms to the many mind-bending hallways that mess with your head before rearranging their framework to form a new path forward. NaissanceE is at its strongest during the moments that bewilder and amaze without an accompaniment of confusion, moments which begin to occur more and more rapidly and on a grander scale the deeper into the world you get.\n\nInterspersed between the wandering and sightseeing are occasional platforming and puzzle elements. Neither encroachs upon or disrupts your progression for more than a moment, but serves as a nice supplement to the experience and fleshes out the gameplay to be something more engaging and further immersion (an unusual mechanic involves you needing to time your breathing to keep sprinting for long periods of time, which while odd at I actually came to appreciate for making me feel like I was playing a person and not a camera on wheels). While many self described "exploration adventure games" consist of nothing but walking from point a-b, NaissanceE actually has quite a bit of "traditional" gameplay that, while basic and secondary to the overall focus on exploration and player defined narrative, makes it hard to dispute that it is indeed a "game" and not just an "experience".\n\nHaving played NaissanceE to completion, I have no doubt of the very clear and focused vision the developer obviously had when creating this game. It's unlike anything else I've played and at many times simply a wonder to behold. But along with this vision came an abundance of technical and design missteps, the most prominent and unacceptable of which is the checkpoint/save system. The only way to save are at checkpoints purposely placed at points in the game, but the problem is that these checkpoints are much too far apart from one another.\n\nDeath is an annoyingly common occurrence do to how easy it is to slip off a ledge as well as the general trial-and-error method of solving many of the puzzles, and because of this you are largely required to replay large sections of the game because of how sporadic the checkpoints are. I spent at least 1-2 hours going through the motions trying to get past a handful of troublesome sections, a tiresome affair that at times made me want to stop playing and never look at the game again. I can't say it strongly enough how much frustration would have been avoided had there been a way to manually save, and I can only hope that the developer reads this and the complaints on the forums and adds it in. In its current state it's almost bad enough for me to not recommend the game at all, as those less determined than I may find themselves giving up early on and not at all unfairly. A handful of other less prevalent technical problems also cropped up (a bothersome fan being the most aggravating), but updates seem to be on the way so they hopefully won't be a problem much longer.\n\nNaissanceE's other problems are mainly a fault of its inherent design of having the player figure nearly everything out for themselves, with no guide or clearly marked route through levels to guide them. Many areas are almost too big for their own good, leading to a lot of dead ends (some intentionally misleading by design) and wasted time running in circles because I didn't see the staircase on the side of a wall or mistook a doorway for a meaningless gap. This becomes less of an issue the longer you play, as certain patterns begin to reveal themselves and you get better at spotting the fakes passages for the real ones, but early on it's definitely a problem and one that will discourage a lot of players from continuing as they are literally left walking in the dark.\n\nUltimately, no matter how exasperated I got at the save system or the time spent entirely lost in the maze like structure, I kept returning to NaissanceE because regardless of these issues the world it creates is so remarkably compelling. When everything clicks it's an experience unlike anything else, captivating and creative in ways I have rarely seen in any game. It asks a lot of the player, more so than it has a right too (namely to stick with it past the awkward first few hours and its abomination of a save system), but if you can accept those issues it becomes something that you need to see and play for yourself...after a few patches.\n\nFull disclosure: This game was reviewed using a code provided by the developer.

The first real platforming sequence is alright, you interact with a unique aspect of the environment and rely on very basic timing to make it to your destination. The second real platforming section though... it just looks so unlike the rest of the game. The fan blades, axels, and gear boxes seem out of place when compared to the environments that you have previously gone thorugh. Combine this with a wind mechanic that will pick you up and throw you to your death if you do not move fast enough and it becomes very apparent very quickly that you're expected to complete these sections at a sprint. Any slow down inveitably results in you being picked up by the fierce wind and thrown into the fan blades which immediately kill you.\n\nI would not recommend this.

It’s an exploration of light and value, an abstracted treatise on loneliness and silence, and an experiment with architecture and puzzles.\n\nMy favorite aspect of this title is how well it maintains a “spacious claustrophobia”. The game shifts among moderately sized rooms, tiny spaces, vast expanses, and extreme heights that can elicit an acrophobic response (fear of heights). I would love to play this game on Oculus Rift for sure. The size relation according to the player’s movement and perspective/value shift effectively convey the monstrous spaces and architecture. But what creates the dichotomy of “spacious claustrophobia” is that, despite the looming heights and open spaces, there’s a ceiling – the player can only guess what this ceiling is part of. Later on this contrast is intensified in the desert chapter.  The spaces and architecture create an enormous feeling contained within a very claustrophobic feeling.\n\nOn top of all that, there are all these buildings and objects and strange machines, but where are the inhabitants? The world is empty of any kind of sentient creature (except perhaps the host...perhaps). This compounds the odd feeling of "spacious claustrophobia” and lends to a constant sense of unease and creepiness.\n\nGraphically the game is gorgeous. Fantastic value combos and muted color schemes add to the game’s atmosphere. There are too many opportunities for screenshots. Most of the textures in the game are smooth, but they blend perfectly with the other aspects.\n\nThere’s a lot of music in this game, but also plenty of silence. The selection of music is very appropriate, many eclectic tracks and many selections from Deep Listening by Pauline Oliveros, Stuart Dempster, and others. I actually picked up the Deep Listening CD as a result of the game, and also discovered some of Dempster’s other meditative work. The times of silence in the game are poignant and at times downright crushing. Play the game in a quiet place with no background noises and the silence in the game will definitely assault the ears.\n\nMechanics involve mostly running and jumping. There’s no “interaction button”, but walking into lights and cubes sometimes triggers environmental reactions. Running includes a breathing button-press mechanic, which must be timed properly to be able to run without trouble. This is important in later parts of the game where the player must continue to run without interruption or die. Speaking of dying and reloading, there's a lot of that at times, which occasionally becomes a mild irritation.\n\nAs to the meaning of the game…the developer states on the game’s website that it’s open-ended and intended to be looked at through different perspectives. For me, the game is about the cyclical nature of life: run, run, look where to go, look how to go, look when to go, run some more, get pushed and pulled by various forces, experience all the different values of emotions, run some more, and then rinse and repeat.\n\nOverall, an oddball gem that will hammer a stake into your mind if you let it. An easy 10/10 for those who want a surreal experience.","April 3, 2015","true","16.2"," 18 of 23 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","18","23","0","0"

The dynamic light when actually used is just utterly brilliant as a tool to both look fantastic and work as a platforming mechanic. The style of the world you explore through is so unique and compelling.\n\nHowever 90% of the game is either incredibly linear or utterly stupidly open with zero direction leaving you to wander, sometimes unluckily dying after 30 minutes of confusion which leads to my next point. The checkpointing is probably the worst I think I've ever seen. The platforming and one shot kills from trial and error sequences will look stunning but be unbelievably frustrating because there is no skill or strategy to anything that Isn't walking, bar one or two instances. The puzzles work okay but are just not there, maybe three in the whole game.\n\nThe way the game introduces itself and its very minor mechanics is inspired. However the quirkyness, imagintion and beauty of this game will quickly grab you then slowly loosen its grasp as the frustration grows. I've never gone between the peak of enjoyment to utter resentment of a game so many times in such a short space of time after starting the second half of the game.\n\nI got to what I imagine is the "last boss" of the game, bearing in mind this is a exploration/platforming/puzzle game. The boss is just a trial and error grind where I still don't know what your objective is supposed to be to defeat it(get used to that in this game). The checkpoint is about 20 seconds before you're allowed to do anything with your character. After 3 deaths I finally lost the will to play anymore.\n\nPlay until the desert and then quit. Other than that this is a cardinal sinner of bad game design and aesthetics cannot overcome its gigantic design blunders.\n\nTry harder France.","September 25, 2014","false","4.1"," 29 of 44 people (66%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","66","29","44","0","0"

Although when you happen upon a an “actual” puzzle you will know it, the traversal of the world itself can in many cases present like a form of puzzle solving. Some of these specific platforming puzzles can be straining (read: frustrating) due to the inherent problems with the “first person platforming” medium, but these moments are (according to me) few and far between.\n\nIf you like the sense of scale and loneliness from Myst, the type of first person platforming made famous by Half Life, and mind f-ing absurdity in the stylings of Antichamber, then this game is for you.","May 19, 2014","true","5.5"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","13","16","0","0"

NaissanceE throws you into a world with no hand holding and absolutely no direction. The first two levels are gentle exploration and minor platforming where you mainly need to avoid large falls. You are introduced to a breathing mechanic that truly isn’t used until much later in the game. This time is used to let you truly take in the aesthetic design. The game then throw some interesting puzzles at you, continues with a descent into madness, which was someof my most unique gameplay I've ever experienced and finally the game becomes a rather difficult platformer.\n\nGraphics:\n\nGraphically NaissanceE is one of a kind. The world is almost entirely gray, with high levels of contrast. At times you are engulfed in total darkness or blinded by excessive amounts of light. NaissanceE finds unique ways to play with lighting. This can be the necessity to case a glowing orb in order to see where cliffs may be, or an entirely dark room where you can only see when the lights flicker for a moment. The lighting is used at time to invoke desperations or the sensation of solitude. At other times its used to help extenuation the scale of the environment. This is also re-enforced by the blocky/simulation esc world design.\n\nFun Factor:\n\nNaissanceE is more of an experience than a game. It is undeniably interesting to wander the massive environments. You also never know what exactly you should expect next. It has some truly clever puzzles and some intense and fairly difficult platforming moments. It’s also unforgetably different than anything else I have ever played. I did at times find myself frustrated by random falls or by being unable to figure out which way to go. Limase Five has listened to used feedback and added addition checkpoints but it is still occasionally frustrating.\n\n\nVerdict: 7.5/10\n\nSo let’s go through the pro and cons list and do I recommend that you buy this game.\n\n\nPros\n\nBeautiful environment and atmosphere\n\nTruly Unique\n\nUnforgettable experience\n\n\nCons\n\nNot for everyone (too unique)\n\nShort (approximately 4-5 hours)\n\nOccasionally frustrating (checkpoint save system)\n\n\nThere are also a few minor features missing, features that are now common place. There was no controller support, steam cards or achievements.\n\nI’m also curious to see if a Occulus Rift version of this game could be made.\n\nIf you are looking for something different, GET THIS GAME.\n\nIf you are a platformer fan this can be a good option but its more of an exploration game.\n\nAnd finally if you are easily frustrated, steer clear!","March 4, 2014","true","4.9"," 15 of 20 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","15","20","0","0"

The sense of scale NaissanceE provides, the sheer immensity of its environments with seemingly endless verticality is unrivalled by any other game I've ever experienced. The world is utterly alien, and so completely sterile and lifeless, I actually began to hope I'd make human contact. The unique mechanic of manually forcing the player character to breathe during periods of strenuous activity, and the yelps and periods of recuperation required after a long fall, act to remind the player that they are controlling a human body, and that there is nothing else in the world which bears this sense of organic fragility. I began to make up my own story as to what I was doing in this world - I, who had been born, traversing a world without birth or death. Who made this world? How did I get so out of place as to arrive here? The game provides no story, no explanation, no end and no beginning, beyond that which you want to assign it. I thought it was superb.\n\nUnfortunately, the second game comprises tedium and frustration as you jump from moving platform to moving platform, punctuated by regular trips, falls and checkpoint-reincarnation. Additionally you will regulaly fumble about in pitch black, only knowing when you've hit a wall because the game has stopped the head-bob animation, and watch in dismay as the aforementioned sense of scale is transformed into stifling claustrophobia.\n\nFortunately the first game is much, much longer than the second, which makes NaissanceE easy to recommend, but I never actually finished the second game - I had to watch the last minute of gameplay via YouTube as I simply could not pull off the ridiculous jumps required. Quite why they thought it would be a good idea to send off this otherwise pensive, almost zen-like game of exploration with a swift series of firecracker bangs is beyond me. It leaves a sour taste in the mouth after an otherwise sumptuous meal.","December 13, 2014","true","5.1"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

It feels as though you're journeying through some kind of limbo, with levels, designs, and ideas pulled out of the ether rather than being something consciously created. Environmental puzzles punctuate the experience, involving primarily working out how to get from point A to point B and some light platforming. If you're inclined towards more unique, thoughtful and solitary experiences I highly recommended it.","January 6","true","3.5"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

The level of detail, even in out-of-the-way or inaccessible areas, is very impressive.\n- Actual gameplay, including both platform and logic puzzles. Contrary to what you might think from the game description, this isn't just a walking simulator.\n- Neat breathing mechanic. It would be cool to see this used in an Amnesia-type game.\n- No story, no dialogue, and no explanations keep pretentiousness to a minimum.\n\nThe Bad:\n- Doesn't stick with any gameplay mechanic for very long. The moving lights, sliding puzzles, rotating fans, etc. only make appearances in their own individual chapters and are never mixed together.\n-  A few areas are almost too dark or disorienting to navigate.\n- Directional cues vary from subtle to non-existent. Sometimes this adds to the game's atmosphere, but it can also become incredibly frustrating.\n- Only 3-5 hours long. Not much replay value either, unless you really want to explore.\n\nIf you think this sounds like your type of thing, go ahead and buy it. It's definitely not for everyone, though, so if you're on the fence, wait for a sale.\n\nIt's also worth mentioning that the game takes a lot of inspiration from Tsutomu Nihei's manga “BLAME!” If you're a fan, this game is definitely worth a look.","February 14, 2014","true","11.0"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

It is intriguing, sometimes scary, sometimes awe-inspring. Even though there is literally no story, the vague, allegoric mood present makes its own sort of narrative, with blocky ghosts flying around your head while a giant musical instrument submerged in sand plays some music for you or platform chases by giant floating worms.\n\nGameplay here is certainly secondary to the atmosphere, but nevertheless it was pleasant enough UDK-platformer-faire, with some puzzles and a sprint-breathing mechanic built in. However, I didn't like some middle parts where you are disoriented by pitch-black darkness constantly and have to randomly find some glowing cubes for reference. Pretty frustrating. Still, it was decent enough.\n\nMusic was as expected, minimalistic, but very well used for atmospheric effect, be it during exploration or during chase scenes. No complaints here.\n\nIn short, if you like experimental minimalist games with great atmosphere get it. Just don't expect any clearly explained story or AAA-class gameplay and you will be greatly pleased.\n\nHave fun!\n\n","October 8, 2014","true","8.5"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

It's a weird, atmosphere and often downright unnerving journey through realms of forgotten history, strange technology and expansive realms of unidentifiable peculiarity. It's abstract and strange, and there are layers of meaning when you look for them, but for the most part it's simply a fun puzzle platformer with one hell of a mood. It does a great job of creating a bizarre and changing world, but keeps connections to reality and understandable mechanics with just a hint of reality and logic so we can create a bridge between our character and the strangeness of the world.\n\nThere are some minor technical issues like screen tearing with lack of V-Sync, and some outright annoying and frustrating puzzle sections, but otherwise it's well made and doesn't feel cheap and the only other gameplay complaint is lack of mechanics, but it never feels samey or repetitive. NaissanceE is short, but probably fairly priced, though the majority of us should probably wait for a sale since it's a very love or hate kind of game.","August 1, 2015","true","5.6"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Simply put, NaissanceE is one of the most moving experiences I've ever had in a virtual space and the reason being is the games hauntingly chilling embodiment of the human experience and its mezmerizingly beautiful and awe inspiring visual representation. The staircase scene in particular gave me chills, its dark, Sisyphus-like personification of our own humanly grind, the questioning of one's choices, "am i going the right way?" or "did i make the right choice?" feeling of being trapped in your own thought patterns, I think it draws a unique and interesting parallel between some of the real life choices we make; our doubts, our fears, our second guesses, that voice thats tells us: "you ♥♥♥♥ed up, turn around and start over." but you learn, you perserve, and you stumble through the dark, not knowing if the path your taking is the right one, but you stay the course and realize that with patience and willpower you can sumount any obsacle. However if you dont understand this basic but very powerful symbolism at work here, then I feel you, as a reviewer, you are sorely lacking the intellectual knowledge to put forth any meaningful critque of this "game." Its like saying "I don't get it, so its dumb." which yes, IS a hilarious paradox, i know. And generally speaking, most people dont read anymore, (outside maybe comercialized fiction) cannot understand simple rudimentary philosophy, and cant deconstruct simple abstract concepts, so its of little surpise to me that the sheer depth of the ideas were not ABLE to be fully appeciated by some, who, mistook it for what it is not....a puzzle "game."\nThe entire nature of my apprecaition for NaissanceE is its embodiment (at least to me) of philosophy, specifically existentalism. Its colors (the white and black has a Cartesian Dualism thing going on), its themes, the relation of spaces to one another, the themes of light and dark, the feelings of "deja vu" or of feeling like your doing the same thing over and over (Again as I was saying, this is done on purpose to illustrate some of the pointless things we do in our own lives, our routines, our rituals, our habits.), the vast universal emptiness, the feeling that your creation was pointless, that your are all alone and all that matters is the choices you make.\nNaissanceE's art style is a conglomerate of Platonic solids, Surrealist dreamscapes, Escher-like reflections and continuems, and vistas taken seemingly from a dream of H.R. Giger, its sets a chilling, foriegn and otherwordly atmoshpere. You can almost sense that it wants to reveal its purpose to you and NaissanceE does that, as you wonder the creeking echoe-y corridors, running through monochromatic tunnels that bend and twist, you begin to discover the silent "story" deep inside this quiet structure. NaissanceE is able to conjure an extraordinary amount of reason and feeling using basic shades of grey and simple blocks, stirring deep, complex human emotions seemingly out of the benign. Which is what makes NaissanceE a truely unique and different experience.  NaissanceE is test, an allogory to the testament of human will, and finding internal truth.\n","April 16","true","11.2"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","7","8","2","0"

NaissanceE is a game I have been waiting to explore since I saw the first trailer over a year ago. The game takes place in a huge mysterious world similar to games like Kairo and Portal 2, however you never get lost due to its great design. It tests your mental skills one minute with puzzles, then within minutes you are running through a challenging obstacle course and then challenges you with some 3D platforming with crazy lighting like in Electronic Super Joy. It never gets repetitive, predictable and boring, but atmospheric, exciting and mind boggling. The vast and gigantic structures that are surrounding you during your journey are awing which is complimented by the amazing soundtrack that - at times - sounded like something that Elves would listen to in Rivendell from The Lord of the Rings and at other times the objects in the environment move to the music, similar to games like Tearaway and SoundShapes. It took me 4.3 hours to complete it and I feel like I got my moneys worth because of how much I enjoyed it, but I will understand if others disagree because after completion, there is no reason to go back to the game so an extra hour or so would of been nicer.

I'll outline some for and against points with this game to start with:\n\nPros:\nThe world is breathtakingly large, a marvel in its own creation.\nAgain, the world is incredibly beautiful and mysterious, in its werid monochromatic way.\nInteresting mechanic with managing your breathing as you run, and creating a sense of freedom in your movement.\nPuzzles are largely based around your ability to move and position yourself and other objects.\nIncredible ambience, makes you feel like you are isolated, but almost as if this massive structure is watching you, or some primal emptiness is observing your every move.\nCons:\nPuzzles are generally simple and can be boring at times.\nThe monochrome palette of the game sometimes leads to great difficulty in finding your way forward, especially when lighting is either very low or very high, which is more common than one might think.\nWith the breathing mechanic, it occasionally becomes tedious to continually click, especially in large open areas which you want to traverse as fast as you can. Don't get me wrong, it's an impressively original mechanic, and I love its execution, but there are some parts which could become boring when incorporating it, if you don't want to take it slow and admire the scenery.\nI know that it seems like I don't have a lot to say about this game, but that's because so much of it is just so evocative and so enigmatic, that it's impossible to put into words. The nature of the environment is uncannily familiar, yet weirdly alien and distant, and just creates that feeling of uncanniness that stirs such emotion in the player. The emotional response to this beautiful world is almost like that feeling deep in your chest when you watch a TV show that focuses on something a little too close to home to be comfortable watching; like it's almost invasive and weird to see an outsider's view into your world? That's that same feeling in NaissanceE; you see this world which bears these uncanny resemblences to our own, but the sheer scale of the loneliness just greys out all your thoughts and fears about what could be around the corner, like a normal atmospheric semi-horror game could do. You feel a certain pale lamentation for the emptiness of this world. It's so hard to find the proper way to speak of the emotional response I have had to this game so far. It's like trying to grab a moray eel with chopsticks and push it through a pasta strainer. It's like... what!??\n\nTHIS GAME REQUIRES IMAGINATION AND INVESTMENT IF YOU WANT TO FEEL WHAT I FELT\nI don't think that the developers have concrete lore for this story. I don't think they will ever implement it or ever should. I think that the true value in NaissanceE is what the player does with what they feel from this game. How YOU rationalise (or don't!) this crazy world that you find yourself exploring. I love to create lore for this, but I don't think any of it is more correct than any other. This is not a game about a backstory creating a storyline. This game is about a storyline creating a backstory, or artistic impression.","April 24","true","4.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","2"

(The riding cubes down the wall part, the wind tunnels part, the final "bossfight". All awful stuff from a gamedesign perspective.) The breath mechanic ultimately doesn't add anything except annoyance. There is for the most part no direction or hints of where you're supposed to go, but for a game of this type that's perfectly fine, though it does leave you wondering if surviving a long fall means you broke the game and you're not supposed to be where you are, or if you actually found the right path.\n\nIt has some very nice visuals in places when it doesn't lose itself in abstract gobbeldygook and goes to the more realistic BLAME!-like environments. Unfortunately the amazing infinite city vibe only reveals itself in about half of the gametime, leaving the other half clambering around in tubes or cubespew corridors. The desert was really cool, but I'm not sure if I got to see all of it really.\nIn most games light is there to help the player, but in this game is there to actively annoy you and make things irritating.\n\nMy advice: Play until you see the text "Breath Compression" appear on the screen, then exit and uninstall the game. You'll miss out on "Interlude" (which really is just 5 minutes of holding forward, but the leadup to the next chapter is great) and "Endless Dive", but you won't have to slog through the insipid bullcrap of the chapters surrounding them.\nUnfortunately the first part of the game is also awful, but it's worth slogging through if you've already got the game.\n\nI can't really recommend this game, even if this is exactly the kind of game I enjoy. :-( This makes me sad!","January 4, 2015","false","3.2"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

Getting lost in its labyrinthine structures is not uncommon and some levels, particularly towards the end, can be only described as trolling the player, which is sometimes amusing, but sometimes not. It can get rather infuriating at times, and I leave it up to you whether you are willing to excuse that.\n\nBut you should. Because the game's levels, or rather the spaces that you get to explore, are phenomenal. Ranging from minimalist claustrophobic structures to vast city-sized complexes, at the same time alien and familiar, they are surprising, majestic and beautiful in their own stark monochromatic way. The stellar sound design also deserves a special mention, and so does the exquisite soundtrack, complementing the game's spaces in a harmony that's often unexpected, but always inspired. (The levels were built to accompany the already existing music rather than vice versa, and it really shows.) If you ever wanted to feel like a lone explorer of an abandoned titanic complex, built by unknown architects for a mysterious purpose, then look no further: this is a game for you.\n\nOr let me put it this way: NaissanceE is the closest thing I've ever seen to the Rendezvous with Rama game that I've been dreaming about for years.","December 30, 2015","true","3.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","2"

It feels like you're journeying directly into the minds of the creators - it's an interactive artwork, and it is hauntingly beautiful at every turn. Literally every corner of the strange, surreal worlds you'll travel to is captivating and aesthetically incredible, to the point that my finger was practically glued to the screenshot button throughout my playthrough.\n\nDon't go into this game expecting there to be story, or even for puzzles to be a major part of the game. This isn't like the similar-looking Kairo, which IS a puzzle game at its heart. NaissanceE is all about the atmosphere, and has a spectacular soundtrack to back it up. From Blade Runner-esque synthesisers to strange organic grumbles, the soundtrack matches the visuals perfectly.\n\nThe gameplay, I must say, doesn't quite live up to the game's visuals. Sometimes it's really not clear at all where you need to go, and more in-game hints would be appreciated. Also, the platforming can be unintuitive and frustrating at times, and while the mechanic of controlling the character's breathing while running is innovative, it's more of an annoyance than adding to the experience. I've heard some criticism about the game's checkpoints being harsh and complaints about frequent deaths. I personally think the hazards the game throws at you justify the number of times you'll fall to your doom, and the anxiety you'll feel works well to complement your isolation in this bleak, hostile world. I do, however, think the ending was underdeveloped, and could have possibly done with a cutscene of some kind to wrap things up.\n\nAll in all, though, NaissanceE was an experience I won't soon forget. It's possibly not a game for everyone, due to the lack of story, but if you know what you're getting into and enjoy atmospheric games like I do, you're in for a mind-expanding treat.","March 22","true","6.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

This was an intriguing, a bit exhausting, and yet intersting experience.\n\nDescription says "The main idea behind the game is to make the player appreciate the loneliness, the feeling to be lost in a gigantic unknown universe and to be marvelled by the beauty of this world.", and i think this goal is fully achieved. Level design is really impressive and you often stop running just to admire.\n\nHowever, i think the game is a bit overpriced. I'd say it's worth 6 to 10€, depending on your taste for weird games :D","March 10","true","2.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

Absolutely worth it, if you like exploring strange and overwhelming (really!) worlds at the detriment of the mechanics.\n\nIts focus is definitely not on the mechanics (mostly first-person platforming, when it is), but it's certainly solid at those parts. There were a couple of sections where the game failed to guide the player, but nothing major -- especially when taking into consideration everything else.\n\nThe atmosphere is fantastic, with great hand-picked soundtracks! It reminded me of 2001: Space Odyssey and even Akira, at times.\n\nRanges from awe-inspiring to what-the-♥♥♥♥ am I experiencing in a very nice way!\n\nBasically Tsutomu Nihei meets Kairo meets Antichamber.

The game is anything but mundane and is quite insane.  You start off doing minor navigation through a pleseant labyrinth of multiple choices of doors, stairways, and paths with a zen-like music feel.  Yes, this appears to be a relaxing game of adventure, right up until half way through and down the rabbit hole.   Hurry, Hurry, rush we go.  Time is a ticking or you get your licking.  Where little Alice, NO REALLY IT'S LUCY, goes nobody knows.  And the descent is simply maddening like a cross eyed Hatter.  Mind the gap, it's quite a trip.  Not even a quick pause for a simple sip of tea... That's right, this game will have you thinking that you took a hit of acid or something.  "WHAT'S HAPPENING?!?!"... Seriously though, it took me about 10 hours to complete.  The first half of the game was relaxing, slow paced, with moments of stillness for trying to figure out where to go, and the last half is quite simply out of this world and like nothing I have seen in all my 20 years of gaming.  I believe it won somekind of Indie Choice Award.  And even though the last half was frustrating at times and had me helling at my computer screen (like it could hear me and could change the game because I said so) THIS GAME WAS WORTH THE EXPERIENCE!...

While scaling down towering apartment complexes, feeling your way through pitch black corridors, and clutching against the wall from a burst of wind as you cross paths miles above the ground you encounter you'll discover remnants of a human life now either erased or abandoned. From strip clubs to a child's room with the television still running, you'll get a feel for life in this steel monolith.\n\nThough advertising itself as a puzzle game, NaissanceE fits more in the realms of a first person platformer. You'll spend more time falling from missed jumps than stuck on puzzles. Many of these moments are built to hammer in the player's mind the sense of vulnerability and insignificance to the towering structures around them.\n\nDuring one segment, the player must traverse over a thin walkway overlooking huge steel structures hundreds of feet below. The wind at this height is lethal, and the player must sprint to sections cut off from the wind or be thrown into certain death. These segments evoke a real sense of panic and fear that the game's breathing mechanic is built around.\n\nBreathing serves both as a way to contrast the main character as something familiarly organic against the metallic world around them. Player's must manage their breath as they run, keeping it under control. Should the player panic and lose its rhythm, they will find themselves partially blinded and slowed considerably.\n\nThough I am currently unfinished and only two hours in, NaissanceE is a strong contender for my game of the year, without a doubt. If you're someone who enjoys games like the brooding sci-fi atmosphere of games like The Swapper or enjoy the rarely seen FP Platformer, I strongly suggest you pick up NaissanceE.","February 14, 2014","true","6.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Great graphics, Great sound assets. Great Soundtrack. Ewokes haunting feelings of awe, loneliness, madness, anxiety, absolution, existensialism, confusion, disorientation, mystery and joy. It's a beautiful abstract piece that says so much and so little at the same time. It really shows how to merge art with gaming.\n\nNow some of you might worry that this is just another linear walking simulator, in my opinion it is not. There's a lot of walking and exploring, granted. But there are puzzles, platforming and failure states too. Which makes NaissanceE qualify as a game.\nThese puzzle-platforming segments are seamlessly blended into the narrative, so seamless in fact it is sort of hard to notice when the game transitions from puzzle to exploration. Although the game never tells you where to go or what to do, i never found myself lost, As i imagined what i would do if i was in the protagonists shoes, and acted accordingly. I "role-played" if you will.\n\nOver all NaissanceE is probably the most immersive game i've played in a good while. And i especially recommend it if you like the atmosphere of Cube, Eden log, Brazil, Enter the Void, Pi or The Matrix. Those are movies, i know, but that is not to imply NaissanceE is more of a movie than a game, it's very much the opposite as it doesn't even have any cutscenes at all. It just has a similar atmosphere to said movies.\n\nI will totally replay this game once oculus rift is released.","October 25, 2014","true","4.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It's an experience.  And an amazing one at that.  To start, as shown in the trailer, you are taken and thrown into a room.  You have no idea where, you have no idea by what, and you have no idea why.  Heck, you don't even know who you are.  But thats not the point of this game.  What you DO know, is that you need to LEAVE.  As you progress, you get the feeling that something is wrong.  Theres nothing out there hunting you specifically, no horror-game spooks.  But you start feeling that something about this huge-scale world is... off.  Like you just don't belong.  The largeness of this world, the ambiance, how the entire UNIVERSE that you're in seems to play with you and mock you, is unsettling to say the least.  As you spend time with this game you're no longer a person playing a game, you are the person inside NaissanceE.  Every cliff you look over will make your heart race.  When you are in complete darkness you will feel it.\n\nThere's no real storyline, per say.  But after a few hours of play you almost understand the "storyline" anyways.  The only real thing directing you on what to do is the checkpoints.  Sometimes they read "going down" or something of the sort.  But that's it.  The ambiguity of this game is amazing.\n\nNow for gameplay.  Its first person, where you can walk, run, jump, and crouch.  Theres certain mechanics you have to do throughout the game that require all of these functions.  Some of the play is fast-paced, where you know you need to get somewhere RIGHT NOW and really feel a sense of urgency, while others is more laidback. The obstacles are fun, and the puzzles are puzzling.  People have alot of problems about the checkpoints, but it's not that bad.  There were some annoying times, but the way i see it, if im not annoyed at least once then the games not hard enough.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend this game.  Even without the gameplay, puzzle part (which is awesome), just the sheer number of times you just look at this world and think "wow.... I have to climb through all THAT?!" is worth it.  The world itself is very playful, and this is undoubtedly one of the most beautifully made games ive played.

Pauline Oliveros was the perfect choice for a soundtrack composer - in fact the cavernous environments in the game echo some of the settings in which she made some of her most well known recordings ("Suiren", for example, which was made in one of the world's largest subterranean cisterns).   The art design choice to make textures minimal if not nonexistent and instead create visual interest via lighting also works extremely well, giving the game a tone both otherwordly and abstract.   This is accentuated by the diverse level architecture, which deliberately and dramatically alternates between representational and abstract modes, and plays very effectively with scale.\n\nIn some was the most impressive, and for me most enjoyable aspect of NaissanceE is the way the designers managed to explore the various possible permutations of their chosen art style.   Despite the fact that in some ways this style is minimalist, the sensation of playing the game is almost one of sensory overload.   No one visual element overstays its welcome, no one theme or motif is overused.   Uniqueness is the rule in this game, not the exception.   If anything, I often felt a twinge of disappointment when moving to a new area, knowing that my time exploring my more immediate surroundings had come to an end.\n\nGame-design wise, there are some wonderful moments.   This is a rare game that succeeds in drawing out poignancy on the most intimate personal level as well as real awe and awareness of personal insignificance.   Of particular note are the times when the concept of infinite landscapes or areas is played with, but other instances in which the rules of the game world otherwise shift or are temporarily broken over the game's course are extremely effective.   There are few other games as capable of eliciting a feeling of wonder and a joy in exploration.\n\nHowever, there are also some unfortunate choices.   While the visual design is extremely varied, the rather puzzling choice was made to have certain reoccurring types of sections that are fundamentally unpleasant to play.   I am thinking here particularly of a series of platforming "puzzles" in which the player must make their way along a rod (often rotating) with various obstacles impeding progress.   This idea is re-used several times and not one iteration fails to be annoying.\n\nThe controls are generally competent, but for a game that relies heavily on platforming, jumping is remarkably "floaty" and imprecise, and it can be difficult to judge whether a given drop will be dangerous to the player character.   This is made worse by several points in the game that feature strong winds capable of blowing the player character around.   This is a fine idea in theory but is here frustrating in practice since the controls already make it difficult to know the exact relationship between player input and player character behavior.\n\nOne final annoyance is that even in the "less pain, more pleasure" version of the game, checkpoints are placed at some very inconvenient spots.   As mentioned before, the mechanics of the game alter at various points over the game's course and the game architecture can be very abstract.   This results in somewhat frequent situations where the player is forced to guess what the designers intend her to do.   There are also several junctures at which the player must make more-or-less split-second choices, the wrong choice resulting in the player character's death.   None of these game-design choices by themselves are bad, but when they come together and the player is forced to make a split-second decision based entirely on guesswork and "game-design intuition" it is extremely aggravating to guess wrong and be forced to either play through a large previous portion of the level or sit through long cutscenes that, though wonderful and fascinating the first time around, feel like adding insult to injury the second.   This also applies to some degree to the platforming sections of the game, which can be quite lengthy and are all-too-easy to fail.\n\nGiven all this, I can only assume the game did not undergo proper playtesting, because these faults, particularly the last, would have easily been spotted and fixed during a well-run QA process.   This makes it doubly saddening that the game was published with said faults glaringly un-remedied.\n\nNonetheless, despite all this I enjoyed NaissanceE greatly.   I admire its ambition and salute the designers' courage in allowing their game to have such minimal explanation, little narrative structure, and in encouraging the player to experience extremes: vast emptiness as well as intimate and claustrophobic detail, dark and light, deafening noise and deaf silence.   In the end, NaissanceE is polarizing as well as polarized.   For those who find the conceptual depth of the game's art and its deft manipulation of space and light compelling, it is a flawed masterpiece.   For those for whom these things are only distractions from its rather clunky mechanics and sometimes unexamined design, it is merely a waste of time.","March 14, 2014","true","9.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

[...] Even time does not exist.[...] There is person in a world such as this.[...] The girl who lives alone in a world that ended. The girl who lives in a vacant, unmoving world. For a reason I cannot explain, she interests me."\n-Clannad Afterstory\n\nFor me this quote fits the game very good.\nTo avoid spoiling I'll go through several criteria. First:\n\nThe sound\n\nMusic is a very important part in every game. Esspecially at games like Naissance or Slender. It supports the gameplay and creates an atmosphere I have never felt in a game. The music makes the game unique. It is interesting how music affect your own reaction in the game. Therer were parts where I thought I got stalked. To create music that is perfectly fitting with design is pretty hard. So that I have to give Naissance in this case 9,5 out of 10 empty rooms. Nobody is able to create the perfect soundtrack, but Naissance comes pretty close to it. Time to the next part:\n\nThe design\n\nThe design is, well how should I describe it? It is needed to create the atmosphere and the impressions you get. The design looks simliar to portal, with a lot less brightness, but still looking sterilized. If you know the movie "The Cube" you will see similiarities to it as well. It is amazing what you can do with a simple design. I have never seen such awesome environment in a game. Yes, everything looks sterilized and grey. But does this lead to make a bad game? No. Naissance surprises in a lot of ways. The location you get to are wonderful places. So here the game gets a 10/10 empty rooms from me.\n\nThe gameplay\n\nThe gameplay is the thing that keeps you playing.  And Naissance master this trait without loosing one second uninterested. I kept playing  and playing. I wanted to discover every single part of this game. This stance is in my opinion attached to a very small number of games only. The normal games are just the normal stuff. Killing, killing, killing. Building, building, building. Gathering, gathering, gathering. If yoz want something that falls out of every categorie mentioned you should buy and play the game. The gameplay is pretty unique. You won't find smth. like Naissance in a long time. Use this chance and buy it. The gameplay overall gets a score of  7,5/10 empty rooms.\n\nThe conclusion\n\nThe game knows how to convince the player in nearly every part. The mechanics and gameplay in combination with design and sound makes this game unique. Allthough I pretty recommend this game, I rate watching the three trailers first for getting a first impression of the game. If you are sure you want to play this game then buy it. You won't regret it. The game gets an overall score of8,83333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333/10 empty rooms and a big praise for the creators for creating such an interesting and unique game.","February 20, 2014","true","13.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The visual aesthetic is amazing, and put to imaginative, constantly-changing use.  This is ably married to an aural soundscape that really helps you feel the mystery, wonder, and isolation of the places you are exploring.  To merely call the game 'atmospheric' does it no justice at all.\n\nIt does stumble in some key areas though.  For the most part, this game is about exploring the world, but it does elect to present challenges at certain points.  Mostly these challenges involve 1st-person platforming.  Mechanically, FPS platforming is hard to do well, and NaissanceE doesn't do it well.   But even setting that aside, those sections the game means to be challenging simply aren't especially enjoyable *anyway*.  They are often ill-conceived in and of themselves; the janky platforming mechanics are just an unpleasant layer on top.  Things are further compounded by some poor checkpointing in places (and I played this *after* a title-update that added additional checkpoints; I dread to think what the original release was like).  Its a shame.  It is a good conceptual fit for there to be threat, lethal-danger and dread in this game - those elements are just the least well realised aspects, due to how there are implemented.\n\nAll that said, there is more good than bad to be had - I'm glad I picked this up, and do in fact intend to play it again; I'm sure there are plenty of nooks and crannies I missed the first time round!  I'd recommend it to others - just know it is a bumpy ride in places.","February 23, 2014","true","6.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's way more horrifying in a lot of ways than any survival horror piece, yet it's also beautiful and awe-striking.  There's a whole bunch of dichotomies going on in this game actually - Its aesthetic is both austere and clinical, yet also baroque and dramatic; and the music is often simultaneously beautiful and immensely creepy.\n\nThe only real downsides to the game were a very surreal middle-section that feels as though it clashes too much with the tone of the rest of the game, and an ending that was terribly abrupt. The main setpieces, however, were absolutely stunning and worth the price of admission alone. The game does a very good job of making you feel tiny, and feels more like a real, cohesive world than almost any other game I've played, since STALKER.\n\nOverall, damn worth the money.

(Pun intended, for those who already played it.)\n\nThere are no downsides to having NaissanceE in the library. It's a remarkable experience worth every penny.\n\nHowever, It shouldn't be bought by those looking for an action packed puzzle first person platform game. That's not what it is and that's not what it tries to be. It is a well paced exploration game, that should be played in short bursts. But I have to leave a warning.

I feel the need to point to the beautiful and enriching sound-design of the experience.\nOtherworldly soundscapes scratch, brood and stretch behind the walls. Creepily chattering mechanisms click, whirr and hum in their spaces. Strange ambient noises fluctuating just on the brink of perception eventually become something else (I swear I heard pigeons at one point)... awe-inspiring.\nAnd then there's the music. An assortment of deep drones, sci-fi winds and strings, and distorted synthesizers serve to capture the scenic moments of tranquil exploration and promote a pounding involvement when the pace picks up and the breathing of player and character sync up.\n\nAs a fan of Blame!, by Tsutomu Nihei, I've been waiting for this game.\n\nIt is surreal, intimidating, engaging, awe-inspiring and all-throughout an atmospheric exploration game worthy of the sub-genre name.\nIf this game doesn't sell you on the idea that video games can be art, I wouldn't know what could.\n\nAddendum: Not for the seekers of casual trial-and-error puzzles. Brain involvement is required. Might also, at times, be very frustrating.\nI'll use a quote from wsgf.org to explain why:\n"No weapon, no flashlight, no idea where you are.

Pauline Oliveros was the perfect choice for a soundtrack composer - in fact the cavernous environments in the game echo some of the settings in which she made some of her most well known recordings ("Suiren", for example, which was made in one of the world's largest subterranean cisterns).   The art design choice to make textures minimal if not nonexistent and instead create visual interest via lighting also works extremely well, giving the game a tone both otherwordly and abstract.   This is accentuated by the diverse level architecture, which deliberately and dramatically alternates between representational and abstract modes, and plays very effectively with scale.\n\nIn some was the most impressive, and for me most enjoyable aspect of NaissanceE is the way the designers managed to explore the various possible permutations of their chosen art style.   Despite the fact that in some ways this style is minimalist, the sensation of playing the game is almost one of sensory overload.   No one visual element overstays its welcome, no one theme or motif is overused.   Uniqueness is the rule in this game, not the exception.   If anything, I often felt a twinge of disappointment when moving to a new area, knowing that my time exploring my more immediate surroundings had come to an end.\n\nGame-design wise, there are some wonderful moments.   This is a rare game that succeeds in drawing out poignancy on the most intimate personal level as well as real awe and awareness of personal insignificance.   Of particular note are the times when the concept of infinite landscapes or areas is played with, but other instances in which the rules of the game world otherwise shift or are temporarily broken over the game's course are extremely effective.   There are few other games as capable of eliciting a feeling of wonder and a joy in exploration.\n\nHowever, there are also some unfortunate choices.   While the visual design is extremely varied, the rather puzzling choice was made to have certain reoccurring types of sections that are fundamentally unpleasant to play.   I am thinking here particularly of a series of platforming "puzzles" in which the player must make their way along a rod (often rotating) with various obstacles impeding progress.   This idea is re-used several times and not one iteration fails to be annoying.\n\nThe controls are generally competent, but for a game that relies heavily on platforming, jumping is remarkably "floaty" and imprecise, and it can be difficult to judge whether a given drop will be dangerous to the player character.   This is made worse by several points in the game that feature strong winds capable of blowing the player character around.   This is a fine idea in theory but is here frustrating in practice since the controls already make it difficult to know the exact relationship between player input and player character behavior.\n\nOne final annoyance is that even in the "less pain, more pleasure" version of the game, checkpoints are placed at some very inconvenient spots.   As mentioned before, the mechanics of the game alter at various points over the game's course and the game architecture can be very abstract.   This results in somewhat frequent situations where the player is forced to guess what the designers intend her to do.   There are also several junctures at which the player must make more-or-less split-second choices, the wrong choice resulting in the player character's death.   None of these game-design choices by themselves are bad, but when they come together and the player is forced to make a split-second decision based entirely on guesswork and "game-design intuition" it is extremely aggravating to guess wrong and be forced to either play through a large previous portion of the level or sit through long cutscenes that, though wonderful and fascinating the first time around, feel like adding insult to injury the second.   This also applies to some degree to the platforming sections of the game, which can be quite lengthy and are all-too-easy to fail.\n\nGiven all this, I can only assume the game did not undergo proper playtesting, because these faults, particularly the last, would have easily been spotted and fixed during a well-run QA process.   This makes it doubly saddening that the game was published with said faults glaringly un-remedied.\n\nNonetheless, despite all this I enjoyed NaissanceE greatly.   I admire its ambition and salute the designers' courage in allowing their game to have such minimal explanation, little narrative structure, and in encouraging the player to experience extremes: vast emptiness as well as intimate and claustrophobic detail, dark and light, deafening noise and deaf silence.   In the end, NaissanceE is polarizing as well as polarized.   For those who find the conceptual depth of the game's art and its deft manipulation of space and light compelling, it is a flawed masterpiece.   For those for whom these things are only distractions from its rather clunky mechanics and sometimes unexamined design, it is merely a waste of time.","March 14, 2014","true","9.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Mostly monochrome, with subtle shades and mostly abstract, cubic architecture, the game surely stands out. The shapes are ranging from entirely abstract to vaguely familiar, the spaces are ranging from uncomfortably tight to uncomfortably vast - and the result is a unique environment that's not tailored to you rather than outright hostile. The impression is enhanced by the eerily atmospheric soundscape.\n\nGameplay-wise, it's a mix of exploration, puzzles and first-person platforming. Who doesn't like first-person platforming? :) But it's well-done, properly checkpointed, and frequently intermitted with exploration and puzzles. There's an interesting gameplay mechanic: you need to regularly press the button to breathe when you're running - otherwise you run out of breath.\n\nThe puzzles never become a routine. You might get stuck on some of them - but I never had to watch a walkthrough. As usual, you just go back to the game the next day.\n\nAll in all, it's a very good exploration game. I can easily recommend it, especially if you liked Kairo.

It’s more a work of art than a game, a popular concept these days.\n\nThe game has you exploring a black and white world, with very little light (for the most part). I found it very difficult to make any progress in the game, as there was no clear indication as to where you should be going or what you should be doing. In terms of being nonlinear, NaissanceE nails it. That being said, I would have liked some sort of indication as to where I should be going at any given time. During one segment of the game, I found myself jumping down a shaft in a way that probably was not supposed to be possible.\n\nCheckpoints in the game are not saved often. I wish quick saves were implemented. That’d make the experience much more enjoyable and a lot less frustrating. I often found myself finishing an area, only to die and have to redo that area. It was quite annoying, as you can probably tell.\n\nThey are asking $20 for the game, but I don’t know if that price can be justified.

A vaguely threatening ambiance cloaks the situation, but there doesn't seem to be any direct or immediate danger present. And still, I count my steps.\n\nNaissanceE is not a horror game, but why the hell not? I believe it might have to do with the game's emphasis on the exploration in place of the peril. The tension accentuates the experience, instead of directing it. A good portion of the unease stems from the horrifically inadequate lighting provided in many parts of the game, shrouding corridors, stairwells, alleys, catwalks, bridges, entire landscapes in a suffocating darkness. In these portions, players would have to tentatively traverse ahead by the seat of their own senses, or wait for stray lights to draw near (enough) to cast looming shadows of pillars and banisters onto surfaces to indicate where the ground ends and the void, or more appropriately, "Everything Else" starts. I refuse to call it "nothing" because although the spaces in the game have the capacity to be quite vast, every square inch accommodates the game's expert sense of mood. In some parts, they underlie curiosity; in others, perhaps wonder, or that persistent unease we were talking about. One wrong step, you won't just take a tumble into inky nothingness– you'll whoosh past stories and stories of additional architecture you wouldn't even have been aware of.\n\nIn NaissanceE, you are alone. And there will not be a moment that goes by without that reality trailing your awareness. This is easily the main factor that contributes to the unnerving tone of the game. Rolling cityscapes with intermittently lit windows, dark underground cubist caverns, miles of interior deserts– walk on, walk on. With such detailed environments, it's a bit diminishing to realize that you are following a linear path. Not to say there aren't manymanymany Many detours one would have to take to find the right one. These pathways seem so organic and natural to the world they're based in that it isn't just beneficial to the game's open-world illusion– often times, it's preferred. I wanted to wander and meander and occupy every space I could discover.\n\nNaissanceE nails the exploration part of the game so well, the other parts of the game simply seem duller in comparison. There are several puzzle aspects throughout, which only ever halted the process of immersion and got me wishing I was someplace else doing something else. It's also heavy on platforming, which seemed to work its way into the "gameplay" without much fuss. Naturally, the platforming segments were the ones that posed the greatest challenge to get through, especially whenever the game started taking inspiration from the fever dreams of Brutalist architects and schizophrenic minimalists. It also doesn't quite find the right way to end. For all of its sound and fury, the final sequence of the game doesn't provide any form of endgame closure to the experience. While it would have been blasphemous to the game's values, or even outright impossible to give a concrete ending to all that had come before it, the game doesn't seem to end so much as stop. Perhaps just as well, as the game isn't about its ending but about its experience; an ending might've ironically allocated more attention into what the game is ultimately building towards, instead of letting the journey justify itself. All the while, backed by an understated but essential soundtrack. Just listen. The music almost seems to inhabit the space you explore. That's good company.\n\n8/10\n\n((Side Note: Though the game's themes and tone hearken back to 2001: A Space Odyssey on a number of occasions, there is only one direct reference found in the game.

Most of those first-person exploration (sans crafting) games have collectibles; NaissanceE needs no such thing - you are going to want to explore every nook and cranny, JUST to see more of the architecture.\n\nSprinting is sometimes necessary. Alice gets out of breath in seconds; map the "Breathe" function to RMB, wait for the circle to appear in the middle of the screen/for her to gasp, hit it and run endlessly... As far as I know, we had to wait until 2014 for sprinting to be done right.\n\n\nAs for what prompted me to write this:\nI seem to have stumbled upon the Red Light District, as it were. Convoluted passageways and abundant staircases yielded discovery of several shops (most of which had the gates drawn), a strip club, an apartment complex... and what seemed to be an elevator lobby. Reaching this final room through a long and cramped corridor; there were three open doors: one took me back the way I came, one circled around on itself, one... One incredibly vast room (I lack the words)('s'minimalistic, though, so). The light from on high only reaches so far.

The landscapes are enormous and breath taking, with the only problem that you may wander for long time before realizing you'll never get anywhere this way.\nThis is definitely a game to be played with a finger perpetually hovering over the F12 key so that you can take a screenshot.

This was most comparable to Antichamber and Fract OSC, although it did have some moments that reminded me of Portal and Mind: Path to Thalamus.\n\nMinor Spoilers Below:\nOne thing that set Naissancee apart from these is that it appears to be massive. I can't judge how large it actually is, but visually, it appeared to never end. The world looks like it should be populated, as there are what look to be houses everywhere, but after checking everywhere, I couldn't find anything that resembled life in the game aside from the guiding light that would occasionally appear.\n\nEventually you realize that you are the only one there in the massive world, and it actually became incredibly creepy for me. This game may have been one of the creepiest games I've played due to the lack of interaction with anything, the darkness, the abandoned world, and the feeling of falling deeper and deeper into a world that you might not have a way out of. Creepiness aside, the game design was beautiful, and the scale and architecture were my favorite thing about the game. It's hard to believe that somebody actually envisioned the scale of this world and took the time to create it.\n\nI thought the gameplay was good, but it is the kind of thing that could turn people away from the game. Most of the gameplay was 'get from point A to point B', and the puzzles available were too easy and too infrequent. This did help to immerse yourself in the world, but it makes me more inclined to describe this as art than as a game.\n\nThe story is largely up to your interpretation. I actually forgot about the main character about halfway through because the story was so minimal (if you can argue that it exists at all). I would say that it's more of a journey than a story.\n\nIt's hard to recommend this for the full price, given the time I got out of it, but the time I had was very good. I would recommend grabbing this on sale though, if you're the type to appreciate art and don't mind light puzzles, light platforming, occasional interaction, and minimal story development. The reason I'd get this is for the beautiful world.  If you don't think you're the type to appreciate the world's design and architecture, this may be lost on you.","May 17, 2015","true","4.2"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

This game has no story, but it features an incredible atmosphere and  equally intense and eerie soundtrack.

The level design was absolutely amazing, the soundtrack was enthralling and the visuals were outstanding.\n\nWhilst there are a lot of complaints about the ending, once again in the circumstances of 'walking simulators' that it is the journey that is the main part of the game and not the ending. Whilst the ending was abrupt and caught me off guard, it did leave me with questions and allowed me to interpret the game as my own.\nJust like movies with open endings leaving questions people get upset and confused as everything hasn't been spelled out for them. If you don't like these types of movies I don't recommend playing this game, or at least keep that in mind as you near the end.\n\nSome of the levels in this game are beautiful and left to be discovered on your own. Whilst they felt quite open sometimes, the path is linear but doesn't make it seem so. For those who are into exploration, I do recommend this title as you feel you are constantly discovering the path or something new.\n\nThe game is a walking artwork, much like Proteus. However it happens to have puzzles and platforming sequences. The checkpoint system was pretty good but I did find the save point was sometimes a lil too far away for my liking.\n\nThe journey was great and I'm going to get other people to buy it and play it for themselves.","January 1, 2015","true","7.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I found myself wanting to be lost. I found a side of me that I don't think I had before.\n\nI felt I was trapped in some sort of dreamlike dystopia, and despite it's sometimes nightmarish darkness or silence, I couldn't help but explore it. With amazing level designs that vary from claustrophobic to massive. Lights will show you the way, sometimes only letting you 'glimpse' the world; so you'll often have to rely on memory, sense of direction, reflexes, and instinct to make it through the game. Make sure to experiment, but watch your step!\n\nThe atmospheric music is brilliant too, almost like something drempt up for a "Blade Runner" sequel. Delicate yet often Powerful. And while the ambient sounds can often get to you, silence may become more frightening to you, in a world where you'll find yourself clambering for any light you can find.\n\nThe only things I would consider for improvement are minor, but as follows:\n- Controller support within menus. I'm glad I can pause with the 360's start button at least.\n- Mouse movement smoothing. It still seems like it's using the raw data from the mouse.\n- Analogue walking speeds. A variable walking speed would be nice, or even a zone with half speed. In areas like "Going Down" I found I had to tap the stick/keys to walk slow enough on the stairs.","November 22, 2015","true","4.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

They look like minecraft cows that have wandered onto a starwars space ship. The world, or 'megastructure' as it might be called, is so sharp and detailed, whereas the beasts that populate it are made up of marshmellows and fuzzy black and white colors. A detailed humanoid creature hunting the player would have greatly added to the game's atmosphere - perhaps a beast that was rarely seen or maybe even showed up at random times.\nAlso later in the game things stray from the megastructure setting to an artsy dream sequence that I thought killed the creepy vibe I was getting from the rest of the game. The platforming in these dream seqences was downright intellectually insulting.\nWhen I heard that the art design of this game was heavily inspired by the BLAME! manga I had to play it. I loved BLAME! and wanted nothing more than to venture into that world. This game succeeds in capturing a lot of the atmosphere that BLAME! demonstrated. HOWEVER a lot of key concepts from BLAME! are missing - such as wandering refugees scattered about the city and creepy cyborg people assigned to kill you as fast as possible. Without these elements I felt the game missed out on a golden opportunity. I'm definitely not one to say 'guns make a game better!' but in this case... I think they would've vastly improved this one.\nI highly reccomend this game to somebody who loves adventure and creepy atmosphere.","March 11, 2015","true","4.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I usually dont like to do this, but there are so many thing going write and wrong for this game, Ive got to break it all up.\n\nGraphics/Art Direction: The game looks fine, its graphics options are solid, and its use of light is phenominal. I understand and appreciate why it lacks color, and Ive got no problems with the game in terms of how it looks.\n\nLevel Design: This is where the problems begin. While the game does a great job of letting you scamper around HUGE structures, there are plenty of places in the game where what you have to do to advance is either unclear, poorly placed, or nonsensical. Also, while I appreciate the desolate look they're going for, the entire game could use a little more to make the environment look just the tiniest bit lived in. For people who say that would ♥♥♥♥ with the designer's vision; there are several rooms that are fully furnished and clearly designed to be lived in. Why cant we get a tiny bit more of that? Worse yet, the envionrment alternates between structures CLEARLY designed for human usage and traversal, and structures that are clearly not, with paths leading though both, with no real common sense defining the layout of the "city" (which appears to be what we're looking at). It goes several steps beyond abstract architecture. Also, for any who were wondering, there is no "story" or "plot" or background. Nothing is ever explained as far as I can tell, which is fine, but its just another thing to note. There are also multiple instances where they pull the old "all these rooms look alike and are chained together" gag, which gets old really fast, as well as some really poorly implemented non-euclidean elements that honestly come out of nowhere. This extends to easter eggs, many of which will force you to restart from your last save. I once got caught in a looping staircase that I couldnt get out of by going either direction, it took me a solid 10 minutes to realize that this was both not the way I was supposed to be going (there ARE several repetitive staircases in this game) and that I couldnt escape. WHY WOULD YOU HAVE SOMETHING LIKE THAT IN A GAME LIKE THIS?\n\nLong story short; the level design is nausiating at times, but pretty to look at, and you will need to look up a walkthrough at least once.\n\nSound: This is probably the biggest failure of the game. Its sound design is like bad prog-rock; it almost seems designed to offend the sensibilities of those playing it. While sometimes it harmonizes with the game's atmosphere with long synth-horn sounds, a'la Bladerunner, most of the time its composed of random little background trills, clicks, whines, and other mechanical noise, which is a bit unnerving, but for the most part its just distracting.\n\nGameplay: NaissanceE is a first person platformer, so it has all the problems that come with that, especially since you cant see your feet. If you've played this kind of game before you know what Im talking about. On top of that, the distance you can fall and how much damage you take seems to change with the weather, with some 5ft drops putting you near death, and some 10ft drops getting landed with no problems at all. There is a sprint and sprint-jump mechanic which requires you to breathe with the bumpers (I played with a controller, sue me), but it doesnt really add anything to the game. For the most part you just look for new places to jump to, then move on. There are some fairly solid puzzles (I think I found 3 over the course of 2 hours), but they're not really anything to write home about. The game's biggest problem is that there appear to be rules that its not telling the player. For instance, there are a series of wind-tunnel areas in the game where you have to walk along the shaft of what seems to be some kind of windpower generator or something. Fine. At random, the game will just decide "♥♥♥♥ you" and push you back and kill you with a gust of wind. There is no text explaining WHY this happens, and no way of knowing WHEN it will happen, but it happens none the less. I suspect it has something to do with taking too long, but I cant be sure. Overall, unremarkable in the gameplay department.\n\nIve got so much more Id love to say about this game, because I sorta enjoy it, but I still feel the price is a ripoff. To boil everything down; its got nice environments that are sometimes intentionally annoying to navigate, the occasional puzzle, and horrible sound design, but for the most part its an unremarkable walking/jumping simulator. Just go play Mirror's Edge with your monitor's color settings turned down or something. I wouldnt recommend this game in a million years, or unless its price drops below $10.","May 8, 2014","false","2.8"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

This game doesn't have the recognition it deserves and is somewhat of a ghost or hidden treasure on steam.\n\nThose two short comparisons and analogies, one of them humorous, do not do this game its proper justice, or prompt you to play the game. This game is a 3D platformer/puzzle game. It is absolutely surreal, and absolutely beautiful. The architecture and detail in this game are amazing and the environment's sprawling expansiveness is sometimes overwhelming.\n\nThis game is exploration based, please take your time playing it. It's non-linear but there are set paths to take. There are also a lot of false-paths that can take you nowhere, because the point is not creating a path to follow but an environment to explore. You will get lost. A lot. And you might like it.\n\nYou might not like it. The game is isolation. These expansive enviroments, detailed. Cities. Houses, apartments, bars, sewers, offices, temples, completely abandoned. The isolation and loneliness is incredibly creepy. You will start to wonder where everyone is. What's going on? What happened? Don't think about it too much, or do. It doesn't actually matter, until certain things occur and you *really* wonder what's going on. It's not a horror game, it's not a "Creepy AI killed everyone in the lab" or "Creepy AI killed everyone on the ship and wants to be God" game, it's just a genuinely creepy game and experience.\n\nYou'll encounter a lot of strange things in the world of NaissanceE, and you'll get lost in the world numerous times. You'll die a few (dozen) times if you're not great, but thankfully the game has a forgiving learning curve: A checkpoint system.\n\nThe puzzles range from linear, simple platform/adventure game style puzzles to abstract and lateral-thinking puzzles. There's also, again, a lot of exploration involved, remembering where you've gone, which areas lead where, and a lot of hidden paths to the next location. It's not Physics/Math based like Portal or Antichamber, and not nearly as lateral thought-demanding as Antichamber, but again, It's different from both games. It's closer to Kairo or Limbo. Puzzles where you'll have to look around, explore the area, look at the big picture, look at the little pictures, and figure out what you've got to do. It could be as simple as moving several blocks around, to having to trigger several switches to get blocks where you want them to go, to more complex puzzles (usually involving disappearing and black matter blocks :D)\n\nThe soundtrack is great. I don't know what Yoga you do, or if you even do Yoga, but it's everything from wonderful sounding new-age ambient music that fits the exploration atmosphere (Stuff I'll usually hear only in Yoga Classes), or creepy tones and whispers that fit the isolation atmosphere. And then for the fast paced platforming actions, there's furious and wild beats that get your mind racing and your adrenaline pumping.\n\nThe price is fair for the game. It can be a long trek, or a shorter one depending on if you get lost a lot (whether literally getting lost, or just admiring the expansiveness and beauty of the environments.) There is some replay value to it just because of the environment and ambience, but if you've got the puzzles down it can lose its appeal fast, like other puzzle games.\nIf you're looking for a creepy, ambient game I would recommend this game. If you're looking for a great platformer, I recommend this game. If you're an artsy gamer who likes architecture, quality, or exploration, then I strongly recommend this game.","January 16, 2015","true","2.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The developer was kind enough to discuss the issue with me in the Steam Community (which is much appreciated!), and a workaround utilizing TexMod was suggested here: http://steamcommunity.com/app/265690/discussions/0/540739861624707674/#c540739862013426168 (effectively replacing the film grain texture with a flat white texture thus negating the effect.)\n\nI do thank the Developer again for taking the time to discuss this with me. However, an accessibility issue this severe with no official support means that I cannot recommend this title. If you do suffer from headaches from certain game graphics, proceed with caution.","April 30, 2014","false","0.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It starts as a combination of running and puzzle solving which looks promising until you finish the first chapter because you then get to the ''Nonsense" parts of the game.\nStarting from chapter two the game becomes boring, your only goal is to find the exit room after room and space after space & it goes worse and worse every time you advance through the game. It reaches a point where it become almost unplayable; dark places that you can't see ♥♥♥♥, very large spaces where you don't know which way you should go & repetitive uninteresting challenges that you have to play again and again in order to pass them. And for what?! for reaching an ending that fails to explain anything or even satisfy the player's curiosity. This game is a must pass for me and I really don't understand why many people recommend it.","September 16, 2015","false","4.2"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","1"

The visuals and the atmosphere are amazing, the environments vast and breathtaking and the lighting made it look great even without textures on anything. However, too much of this game has you stumbling around in the pitch dark or falling to your death because it's impossible to tell what the intended path is supposed to be.\n\nI realize that exploration is part of the game, but when part of that exploration involves walking across a vast desert for several minutes and then figuring out that I'm /supposed/ to fling myself off of a deadly-looking cliff no different than countless others in the game, that's poor design. Or when you're running up a staircase into blackness for literally 3 minutes and you can't tell if the game is progressing or is pulling some Mario 64 Bowser stairs shenanigans (no shenanigans, btw, the staircase is literally 3 minutes of running long).\n\nThere were some decent puzzles along the way, but the vast majority of the game is running across huge expanses of grey nothing or wandering down samey-looking corridors and trying to find which pitch dark little alclove has a staircase hidden in it. Several times I found myself stuck and unable to proceed, only to find out that the solution was to stand around for 30 seconds or so until blocks appeared as platforms or a door opened to let me proceed.\n\nI finished the game just because I wanted to know if there was more to the story, only to find that the game pretty much just ends. This game wants to be Antichamber, but lacks anything to keep me invested.\n\nThe good:\n\nNice visuals, great lighting engine\nControls are good.\n\nThe bad:\n\nDull, grey, featureless environments copy-pasted onto each other. There are huge environments, but they are completely empty and you will find yourself walking down the same identical staircase 8 times for no reason.\n\nAside from a handful of puzzles, most of the game is very boring and uneventful.\n\nOne chapter is literally running across a vast bridge for 2 minutes followed by running up a staircase for 3 minutes.\n\nThe level design is like an Escher painting sometimes, but the path forward is hidden in pitch blackness or drowned out in white bloom.\n\nThe breathing mechanic when running, while interesting, is completely unneeded in a game like this.\n\nSummary:\nI would not recommend this even on sale. There is nothing to drive you forward. The exploration is boring and unrewarding. The levels are huge but contain nothing and if you reach the end hoping to find some idea of what the whole game has been about, you will be immensly let down.","April 11","false","3.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The small amount of puzzles there are are more of an annoyance than hard, requiring stupid jumping with sloppy movement and things you can fall through and get stuck on. I understand the point of being artistic in your simplicity, but I think it would've done the creator a lot more to maybe simplify how enormous the areas are(albeit you can only explore a small amount without dying) and focus on more features in the game, there was a use button but I don't think I had to use anything once. There is just sprint, jump, and breath...in a world that is all white.

Sure I only played for twenty minutes, but I guarantee you it was twice as long as I wanted to play.  I absolutely wanted to give this game a chance because of its good reviews and cool aesthetic.  It reminded me a little of AntiChamber and Portal, but I kept getting vertigo from the awkward lighting and shading.  I get the intention was to be simplistic, but this game complicated the level designs too much and obscured many angles to require both light, patience, and a lot of guesswork.\n\nLevel design: I want to say that what I saw in my short time was fantastic, and I suppose to some degree, that would be correct.  But as a player, you're not eased into this world as you are in the aforementioned AntiChamber and Portal.  You start the game in an empty solid room.  Looks pretty good - I'm intrigued.  But the second you leave this room, you're met with the strangest blocky tower that you have to scale straight up following some ball of light.  And me being the adventurer, I tried exploring through these gross grey corridors, and guess what?  There are no secret areas or fun adventuring.  Instead, you must trudge through a terribly linear area that is rife with pitch black darkness and itss only challenge is to keep yourself from vomitting from the confusing landscape and constant lighting changes.\n\nGameplay: I love being taught how to play the game as I fumble through greyscale graphics and blinding light, only to be rewarded with a dead end, a place I've already been, or falling to my death because of how precise and narrow a lot of the ledges are while waiting for light to happen for a split second at a time.  The controls are just like any other keyboard and mouse game, but there's also this breathing mechanic for running, which is actually pretty cool and new and different and I'm into that.  And giving you about a mile's worth of empty runway to practice it on was a nice touch, but probably the only saving grace from a design aspect.  Oh, and everytime you die (most likely from a fall you can't see), the checkpoints are very unforgiving.  And not on a difficult scale (which something like 1001 Spikes does beautifully), it's more about how ANNOYING it is to drag yourself through all that damn WAITING for the light and constantly adjusting to the darkness.\n\nOverall, it feels like there a ton of these kinds of games, the "walking simulator" variety.  But here they tried to shoehorn a bleak story, what feels like a last minute choice to make an otherwise boring protagonist a female, and jarring gameplay paired with vertigo-inducing graphics.  I get the impression that the developers were too busy jerking themselves off with how pretty the game looks and how mysterious it all is instead of focusing on something that could have been amazing.  Like I said, I wanted to like this game.  If they had a better tutorial level or 1st level, something to ease you into this new world and its rules, or even have more frequent checkpoints (given the nature that it's not neccessarily hard - just awful to experience repeatedly), or wasn't too dark and barfy, I would have given it another shot.","October 4, 2015","false","0.4"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

With exception of the two paths there is nothing to see or hear.\nA simple straight path is all you will get with this. If you ever dare leave this path you will find yourself in either an endless loop or a small hallway that will shut down the game.\nThe level design despite beeing some of the more interessting I have seen recently was horrible. I fell through so many platforms and tried to jump down what seamed to be small paths only to be tricked by the games perspective.\nThe Engin room as i call it was the most infuriating level ever, you have to be literally perfect to get through this, the worst is that the safezones from instant dead give you the idea you might be able to wait for it to pass, but this is wrong.\n\nOverall:\nI did get this game for pretty cheap and it was an interesting experience for the first half.

The game has gorgeous graphics, and when combined with the artistic structures, it really makes an amazing and unique. game. I always had a sense of isolation when exploring the game, whether it was walking down a long, thin, hallway, or descending a massive structure. The game has almost no story, or HUD, but the creators really proved that you dont need that in a game for it to be good. The environment is one of the best parts of the game, and I felt the need to take a screenshot anywhere I saw that interested me.

So refreshing to not really have to have characters, or a story, or powerups, or a series of objectives... Just an intriguing world to explore; It's features stark, abstract, and sometimes beautiful, it's purpose unknown, and perhaps unknowable. The music is fantastic when it appears and is always tied in perfectly with the aesthetics of your immediate environment.\n\nThere are genuine challenges to be found here and there, mostly in the form of abstract logic puzzles, but what the game really strives to create for the 'player' (perhaps 'participant' is a better word in this case) is a series of utterly unique experiences, eliciting awe, wonder, confusion, anxiety and, in smaller measure, but no less memorably, joy. The sheer scale of some of the environments will blow your mind, while others will constantly challenge your perceptions and deny you a clear, point-A-to-point-B objective. It is one of the few games I have played with the maturity to realise the important role that can be played by minimalism. It has its frantic moments, but they are made all the richer by the quiet, meditative chapters that can be found in between.\n\nYou could potentially finish the game in 6 or 7 hours, so based on that alone it might be a bit expensive. But in terms of the amount of original ideas packed into one game, it really is excellent value. I can't recommend it highly enough to enyone who wants to experience something unique in their gaming life.","March 30, 2014","true","3.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The environments seem oddly made for human beings to navigate through them (stairs, doorways, tables, platforms) but yet are forebodingly pristine and devoid of any sign of human or animal activity.  It feels like being in the equivalent of a hamster trail made for human beings by an unseen superintelligent entity.  In that vein, it strikes me as eerily similar to the alternate universe at the end of 2001: A Space Odyssey.  This game is a work of art.  But it may not be everyone's cup of tea.  If you liked Portal, Antichamber, or Proteus, you will probably appreciate this game.","May 6, 2014","true","33.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The game has gorgeous graphics, and when combined with the artistic structures, it really makes an amazing and unique. game. I always had a sense of isolation when exploring the game, whether it was walking down a long, thin, hallway, or descending a massive structure. The game has almost no story, or HUD, but the creators really proved that you dont need that in a game for it to be good. The environment is one of the best parts of the game, and I felt the need to take a screenshot anywhere I saw that interested me. In fact, I think the environment is so greatly designed and mysterious, that I think almost any room that you take a screenshot of could be the cover of the game.\nSo overall, I would definetely recommend this game to everyone to check out, but if you are into hardcore action games, or multiplayer games, this might not be for you. But who knows, maybe you'll come to love the game as much as me. Overall the uniqueness and the amazing art styles in this game and all of the other great things in it add up to be one of my favorite games. Actually, I woudnt call it a game. I would call it an experience.","January 8, 2015","true","5.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The beginning may be a bit slow, but the scenery will become wonderful once you progress.\n\nThere is not much to do. The core of the game is exploration and run / walk. There are very few puzzles (challenging enough) and some fast paced running section. In this sense, this game maybe would have had a benefit by implementing some kind of obstacle course runing style. Not really parkour, but at least a vault over object kind of jump and a slide (more or less like mirror's edge). Nevertheless, the fast paced sections are fun enough but sometimes the movements feel kind of funny and you will have to repeat the section.\n\nIt is not an action game, it is much more towards an inner thinking / interpretation kind of gameplay. There isn't even any lore, no text to read, no voiceover, you only get the name of the current level when you go on to the next level.\n\nThe only real problem I can think of and that was kind of gamebreaking for me, was that somehow the level would not load completely so you would go through a dark door and find yourself out of the map. I doubt that was a wanted thing, because if I reloaded the last checkpoint and played the same section, the same door would lead to a new room. Same thing with some 'interactable' (can't say more for spoiler reasons) objects: I would arrive at point X, and see that those objects were useless. I would be then stuck. By reloading the checkpoint (sometimes much much earlier....) I would notice how the same objects were actually supposed to be moving.....so well, yes, instead of having the surprise effect of seeing weird things moving in front of you, you have the hassle of repeating a whole section again to make the 'moving thing' script trigger properly.","June 25, 2015","true","5.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I love Dear Ester and Verde Station, though I hate Gone Home because it's full of modern politics crap.

Or maybe even some Lynch-like stuff, you know.\n\nAnd I found that NaissanceE is very atmospheric and beautiful in it's simplicity game. Very symbolic and artistic, and makes your imagination go wild. Also NaissanceE is idiotic platformer full of bad design choices, annoying and boring.\nThe game is absolutely empty meaningless canvas that tries hard to give you impression that you need to fill the gaps, but there is no gaps - the game is all empty space. NaissanceE might be a great place to think and imagine if it wasn't ruined by platforming sections and dumb puzzles.\n\nSo after NaissanceE my inner hipster is still starving. In the end it's very shallow and dull experience that you probably won't enjoy too. It is just a pretentious and bad designed platformer that tries hard to seem smart and fails even at that.","May 11, 2015","false","4.9"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Unfortunately, at least in my opinion, it's over before it begins, and you're left with no sense of accomplishment or greater understanding from when you started.\n\nAs many have stated, the artistic style and atmosphere in NaissanceE are absolutely incredible, and give a sense of something infinitely larger and more complex than what you're actually presented with.  Disappointingly, no clues or hints as to the functions of the constructs you'll encounter are ever provided, and you're similarly left in the dark about the mysterious dwellings and habitats you'll come across.

Not a story in the normal sense, but a form of narrative. Why is Lucy lost? Where is Lucy? And who is she? Who is she running from? The game starts - innocently enough - with three words - Lucy is lost, but sadly it doesn't go anywhere from there. This short sentence is the starting point for aesthetically awesome adventure, that sadly left me a bit cold at the end.\nThe puzzles itself were totally fine with me, even the platforming bits were fine, except for the tunnel level - that one got a bit too annoying in parts.\n\nWould I recommed this game? Hell yes! It looks beautiful and has some of the coolest architecture and designs I have seen in a long while!","January 4, 2015","true","5.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It became disconnected from my curiosity and became a chore.\nThere is a puzzle that I'm sure other players of this game will find infamous, if not already. A flickering puzzle that reminded me of another game that relied on echo-location, or the earliest parts of the game where you are chasing the lantern and must rely on it for sight, in order to navigate without falling. That would be fine if the puzzle weren't so cruelly difficult.\n\nYou're introduced with a relatively clear experience, an oppressive tone (yes, that's a plus, it opens with such captivating mystery), and challenging platforming. The game could've used more direct writing to make its meaning more clear beyond a general feeling of fear and stress.\n\nIn the end, was difficult to recommend this game to others. I felt that its consistency fell apart too much despite its beauty.","February 2, 2015","false","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LaundryProDouglas/recommended/265690/","LaundryProDouglas","Byr","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LaundryProDouglas/","381 products in account","Upon some input and continued play of NaissanceE, I found it necessary to write a new review.\n\nFirst of all, NaissanceE is a brilliant game. The term 'game' is a little shaky due to the fact that there isn't much gaming to be experienced. There's no combat, there's no enemies. There's no guns, XP, or Russians taking over the world.\n\nThere's movement. There's levels. You explore them.\n\n'Explore' is also a bit of an understatement. More-so you 'experience' them. The aesthetics are simple yet immensely complex. Areas seem to sprawl on indefinitely. The architecture is believable yet foreign or alien-like. You feel uncomfortable, like you don't fit in. All while everything is in simple shades of grey. No game has ever impressed me visually as much as NaissanceE. If you're like me, you'll be reaching for the F12 key after turning each corner. This game is utterly beautiful. Combined with the music, the ambience, it's incredibly immersive. My first time playing was at night, in the dark, with some good headphones. From the very start I was completely sucked into this game. I felt alone, lost, and confused. The game often made me question what I was actually doing. It wasn't until late-game that I finally embraced this game's concept of a 'leap of faith' and had a bit of a breakthrough with this game. Throughout the game I stumbled upon an amazing number of easter eggs. Some amusing, some degrading. There have been quite a number of times where I find an easter egg, only to walk away from it questioning the game, the developers, my own sanity.\n\nThe game claims to supposedly have 5 hours of gameplay to it. In my experience, I took 3.5 hours to beat it the first time. Keep in mind I took probably 30 screenshots the first time through. Upon completing it, I felt the need to do a second run-through. I'd call it a speedrun, though, once again, I stopped quite often to breathe in the atmosphere and smash F12. This playthrough took roughly an hour. This does not mean I'm done with this game after only a handful of hours; I still find myself wanting to play it again. The game leaves you feeling like you missed something somewhere at some point. Just prior to writing this review I played an early section only to find a whole area I never saw before. In the future I plan to play a literal 'walk through' of NaissanceE where I use the sprint key as little as possible. I feel the undying need to explore every nook and cranny of this game.\n\nAs much as I love this game, the platforming was a little wonky at times. The basic jump puzzles are do-able, maybe a hiccup here and there. The "Less Frustration" patch they put out does help a little, though a few more checkpoints will only go so far. I don't know about you, reader, but solving jump-based logic puzzles in quick succession isn't my claim to fame. Bare in mind that the puzzles in HalfLife2 left me stumped at times. Of course, once you get it right once, you'll probably never screw it up again. The chase scene was, I'll admit, tedious and a bit unforgiving. Fudging a jump or taking too long will result in death rather quickly. And once again the leap of faith aspect kicks in. Much like the previous puzzles, beat it once, you should be fine.\n\nOverall, I love this game and highly recommend it. However, I'm well aware that not everyone will enjoy this game. It's not meant for everybody. If you're a fan of games like Dear Esther, Journey, Gone Home, and other various indie-like, "experimental-type" games, chances are you'll like this one. The price ($20 at the date of writing this) might not be for everyone but I feel content in my purchase. I am a bit of a sucker for games like this though. If you find it interesting, grab it on sale if you want. Also consider looking at some Let'sPlay's, though they won't even compare to what the game itself can provide you with.","March 2, 2014","true","13.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The expansive area you are exploring  is evocative of the vast complex hinted at in the film Forbidden Planet - mechanized perfection but no people - perhaps a society which had been destroyed by its own quest for whatever the complex was designed for.   There were times I simply stood and admired the vistas which were presented to me starting at Level 8 (Big Well).  The sense of scale and my own insignificance in this world were amazing - excellent use of lighting, perspective and industrial haziness - a fantastic technical achievement and a terrific use of the procedurally rendered immersive world concept.\n\nThe negatives: be prepared for frustrations - there is a lot of precision/timed jumping skill required - the fascination with this began to seriously wear off in several levels where it required repeating the level dozens of times to get the timing down, and finally wore off completely on Level 28 (Magnetic Pain) where you have to walk along a spinning turbine shaft to gain access to a tunnel.  I know intellectually that I would be able to eventually master the level through repetition to get the timing down but I started to simply wonder why I was spending my time in this way and lost interest at this point.  I much preferred the puzzles in the game which required logic to proceed versus the obstacles requiring dexterity and timing.  I couldn't help thinking that it would have been brilliant for the authors to have provided two ways to advance - one by jumping and the other by solving a puzzle.  In the case of Level 28, for instance, it would be nice to provide me the choice of either walking along the spinning turbine shaft or solving a puzzle that would stop the spin - this would make for a more satisfying experience and widen the potential audience.  Fortunately I am blessed with enough dexterity to play this game but I couldn't help thinking of those who might not - I submit that this game should be more about exploration and solving puzzles rather than being nimble and quick enough to jump here or there at precisely the right time.  If I ever find myself confined for a long period of time with nothing else to do, I'll return to the game.\n\nOverall - I recommend this game just for the ability to view some of the vistas rendered in the game, but realize you will likely need to repeat levels many times in order to advance.  You may even decide to give up on it as I did but don't stop before Level 8 - Big Well.  This is a world worth visiting just to see it - a Cubist Grand Canyon if you will - well worth the cost of the game.  Note however that I cannot speak to whether there is a satisfying conclusion to the game.","October 19, 2014","true","10.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is one of these exploration games that a cynic might call walking simulators, but NaissanceE actually has enough gameplay to call it a game. Still, a term that might be even more fitting is tech demo for the UE3.\n\nSo NaissanceE is sort of a one-man-project from Limasse Five a.k.a. Mavros Sedeño. It seems like Limasse Five wanted to make a 3D game and was able to do the environment and level design, some animation and a bit of programming. But he had absolutely no clue about 3D modeling, texturing and creative writing, so he nearly completely avoided these jobs.\n\nTake a look at the screenshots to see what the game looks like. It does have its style and surely it is nice to look at. But while the lighting job was probably quite difficult, the modeling and texturing (or nearly complete lack thereof) still make it seem like not a lot of effort was put into it. However, this may be forgiven if you consider that the game was a one-man-project. The graphics completely rely on the advanced lighting technologies of the UE3, that's why I suggested to call NaisssanceE a tech demo earlier.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, NaissanceE is a bit like a 3D platformer. Actual puzzles are rare, you just have to keep going. The challenge lies in the fact that you have no objectives and no idea where you are supposed to be going, so you have to explore the area a bit and figure it out.\n\nRegarding the context and the storyline, the short answer is that there is none. You may interpret the game however you like it, but NaissanceE does not try to push you in any particular direction.\n\nThe game lacks some attention to the technical details. When I opened the UE console with the TAB key, it covered two thirds of the screen and would not close. When I called up the Steam overlay, the game crashed. It also does not install silently like most games on Steam do. And a lot of default strings were not replaced, which is just lazy.\nAlso, the distribution of checkpoints is often quite weird. Sometimes it felt like I was systematically not reset to the last checkpoint, but the one before that. This also adds a lot of unnecessary commute to the game if you die often.\n\nNaissanceE is not a long game. Even if you take the time to explore, the first runthrough should take about 4-6 hours. A replay could be accomplished in an hour or two, speedruns take about 45 minutes.\n\nFor a one-man-project, NaissanceE is indeed quite impressive and a nice experience. But if you consider the lack of features most games have and the corresponding lack of effort, 15€ does seem quite a bit pricey. Definitely wait for a sale or reconsider that this a one-man-project.\n","January 6, 2015","true","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Pay in mind that I have only played the first chapter, where I decided that the game wasn't really worth my time. I just didn't have fun. Why? Here's why.\n\nFirstly, I wouldn't recommend playing this on a laptop. I don't know if it's a part of the game or not, but I had some input lag that drove me absolutely insane. This is a first person game and there are some jumping parts, which made me fall over and over again at places I shouldn't have. Since there is also a part where there is a timing aspect... well, it wasn't enjoyable. Looking around with the mouse also felt floaty and therefore frustrating. As previously mentioned, this might be because I played on a laptop, but it might be worth considering nontheless.\n\nSecondly, the theme of the game is about light and shadows. The problem, in my opinion, is that the dark sections are pitch black. If you're not looking where you're supposed to, this is really disorientating, and finding the right paths can feel a bit random. However, this does add a challenging aspect to the game, which some might love. It is very stylistic and has a very distinct ambience. The music, the dark and the tight spaces does make it feel very uncomfortable and quite creepy at times, which is more of a plus than a minus. There are some intriguing things happening as well, if you can get to them.\n\nThis game was very frustrating to me and I felt that it was a bit too random. Based on this I wouldn't recommend it. But if you like being challenged by hidden paths and if you don't mind being lost and fighting through some less satisfying mechanics, do give it a try. For me, it's a no.","April 6, 2015","false","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's like a darker version of Antichamber, but with less puzzles and MUCH more walking.\n\nGraphics: At first I loved the style, but it got old pretty quickly. It honestly felt unfinished in some parts, but that might have a bit to do with the level design as well. Everywhere you go, it's some form of gray, black, or white. Occasionally you'll get the odd dull orange or dark red, but it's monochromatic for the most part. Other than the boring textures, it ran very well and I always found myself impressed with the scale of the environments I was placed in. Which leads me to...\n\nLevel Design: This is both the best and worst aspect of the game. First of all, I was blown away by how large everything was, and how there were very few loading screens. If you could see a bright point really far off on the horizon, or on a wall somewhere across the huge room, you can probably get there eventually. I remember this sequence where I was decending down this huge city-like area for almost thirty minutes, and it just kept going. On the other side of things, the levels were so erratic and confusing that I often found myself lost among the various gray rooms and corridors. Some areas had lights to designate points of interest, but others left the goal in the dark and I would pass over it numerous times. This is where the game feels unfinished to me. I feel like it needs a bit more polish, a bit of editing, and more specific playtesting in order to iron out those spots that confuse the player.\n\nStory: There really isn't one. You walk until you can't walk anymore, and it lasts about 4 hours.\n\nGameplay: Again, nothing too interesting other than just walking and using light to your advantage. There are a couple mechanics involving certain blocks that disappear/reappear depending on where you orient the light, but those are introduced early on and rarely utilized in the rest of the game. There are plenty of puzzles that play with your perception of reality, which can be interesting. One other gameplay mechanic which I'm not too happy with is the need to "breathe" while you sprint. This means pressing a button as you sprint when a circle appears on your screen. It can make the more intense platforming sections a bit harder, but generally it's just annoying to have to push the button when you're running around aimlessly, which is the majority of the time.\n\nOverall, this game seems like a way to showcase the crazy things you can do with the Unreal Engine, rather than a game you can sit down and enjoy in terms of gameplay. It's fun to watch the environments and explore, but sometimes it can be frustrating with the clunky controls and confusing level design. I enjoyed it, for the most part, and I'm glad it was as short as it was. If it were any longer, I would've gotten sick of it. 7/10","December 1, 2015","true","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You'll find yourself alone in an impressive futuristic structure of some sort, uncertain if it is of human or alien origin, or consists of something more abstract than matter entirely.\n\nI think the most illustrative example of what you're getting into with this game is this: I'm still not sure whether or not I managed to make it outside of the game's normally playable bounds. I took every opportunity I saw to attempt reaching areas that I didn't think I should be able to reach. And, every time I did make it to a new area, I found myself questioning whether or not I had succeeded. Was I skipping part of the level? Was the part of the structure I was currently exploring meant to be for visuals only, or had the game developers intended to allow the player to wander freely in this area?\n\nThe difficulty of puzzles and the frequency of checkpoints felt perfect, and the few challenging action-y/platformer-y parts of the game didn't frustrate me in the slightest. Some other reviews I have seen found the game frustrating. Perhaps avoid this game if you are bad at creative problem solving and lack the imagination required to fully immerse yourself in the experience.","March 14, 2015","true","5.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are a few puzzles, but there's only one that requires any real thought. It's a mostly monochromatic game, lots of blacks and whites with one other color thrown in as a theme every so often.\n\nThe checkpoints are weirdly paced. Some sections are just badly designed. Others induce epilepsy even in non-epileptic people. The game is incredibly short and the ending is unsatisfying.\n\nDespite all this, i can only recommend it.\n\nThe game exudes an atmosphere like no other, you need to experience it for yourself to believe it. The overall art design draws you in and the astonishing music keeps you firmly entrenched in this strange, vast world. The design is such that you are not questioning the developer on the strangeness of the levels, but the makers of the world itself - It really draws you in that much.\n\nThere is a sense of wonder to this game that i haven't seen before in 20 years of gaming. Antichamber comes close, but its experience is far more 'meta', where the game feels like a game rather than a world. In Naissancee, you want to know who built this place and what it's for. You want to see if you can get over there, you wonder what's in that room across the chasm, it edges you forward purely by making you want to see what this world will offer up next.\n\nIn the third quarter of the game, things get a little weird. The segue into this section doesn't really flow all that well, pulling you out of the experience for just a little bit. It does pick up again in a wonderful section where the game simply offers up gorgeous views for you to explore, untill you decide to continue.\n\nThe ending however is the only real letdown of the game. The rest is such an artistic accomplishment simply in its unpretentiousness (if that is a word) while still being grand and evocative, whereas the ending makes a 180 into a snooty pretentious cliffhanger.\n\nStill, despite all its faults, Naissancee is a game you simply need to have played at least once. I think it's very much worth the price of admission, though it's understandable that this game feels very risky - At least get it when it's on sale. :)","July 12, 2015","true","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

One of the best games I have ever played\nNaissanceE is not just an exploring game. It is so much more.\n\nIf you want to save time, just read the following...\n\nA lot of mystery, awesome level design, perfect atmosphere, not too scary (not classified as horror).\nHIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!\n\n\n\nIf you want more, read the rest...\n\nEnvironment/GraphicsThe environments are absolutely stunning and the word beautiful doesn't even begin to describe the level design. With around 15-20 textures in the entire game, it still has the top of the line graphics. The lighting is what makes each scene particularly breath taking (that is a pun, just wait..). The levels contain platforms and other structures made of very simple geometry like cubes and rectangular prisms. The awesome part is how complex each structure is with its detail to make your mind create assumptions to what is is or could be.\n\n\nAtmosphereLet me define a term..\nAtmosphere in a game\n1. The level of engagement the game has on the player.\n2. The level of immersion the game has to make the player believe the game is real while playing the game.\n3. NaissanceE\n\nThe atmosphere is so important in games, and NaissanceE got it right. Music fits into every moment and may be deceiving at times. Without the music there would be almost no point in the game because it gives you the urge to go forward or stop and take in the scene. It is very well performed and implemented while also being really stylistic and creative.\nNaissanceE also features one of the best and most realistic running/breathing systems. It is infinite if you so choose. The breathing is a great feature that throws realism in your face. You may be able to breathe in the game just fine, but remember to breathe in reality (and the pun) because every situation and moment is absolutely breath taking. (it is seriously a problem though, remember to breathe)\n\n\nCharacterThere is not a lot of information given, meaning then that you must be the character. You find out your character is a girl and is named Lucy...              and she is lost. This is told at the very beginning of the game so I wouldn't call it a spoiler. The voice acting is amazing for Lucy, even though it is only grunts and gasps and crying in pain, it is still well done.\n\nLevel DesignI already ranted about the amazingness of the levels and their detail (just look at the trailer to get my point), but as far as progression goes, it is a bit different. The game has a puzzles brilliantly planned out and difficult but passable. The utilities used in the puzzles aren't explained but I wouldn't count that as a negative because when you figure it out, you get the amazing feeling of "did I just do that? YEAH I DID!" {happy dance}.\nThe puzzles and levels are typically utilizing light, which is really fascinating. There are moments that are normal and others that are super bright or super dark each having ways so you can still continue.\nNaissanceE also stays consistent with the overall confusion. You have no idea where you are or where you are going (the exploration piece) and sometimes you get stuff thrown at your face (figuratively and literally) that you just don't know how to handle. As the game progresses you will gain more of an idea of what you should do and how to solve each puzzle.\n\n\nFinal ThoughtsI am truly glad I bought this game. It may be $15, but with so much effort put into each aspect of the game, it is well worth it and the developers deserve every penny. As far as length goes, you'll be looking at about a minimum of 3 hours, short but packed. I would love to spoil the whole game for everyone to share my experience, but that ruins the point. Don't hesitate to buy NaissanceE (unless you want a discount) and watch the trailers, they give a great look inside what it has to offer.\nAs a final rant, let me take you through my thoughts while playing.\n\nYou get in the game, with a little expectation. You hesitate to progress because of what other games have thrown your way. But you march on, because it is so interesting and each thing is so delicately placed that you expect everything and nothing.

Otherwise why would they even include death as a response to going the wrong way or making a huge mistake? The trial and error, the easter eggs and hidden dead ends... The fact that the only way to get a story, or rather an idea as to what is going on, is through extrapulating what the environment shows you, makes the game that much more compelling. yes you could add things to make it easier, but that doesn't always make a game better. The satisfaction of completion well outweighed the learning curve the game presented.\n\nShort version: I don't believe this game is for everyone, but i do believe anyone who can understand it's basic mechanics can complete it.

Both of them are the main reason to recommend this game. Believe me, those two elements are top-notch\n\nUnfortunately that means gameplay it is not one of its strong points. The sad truth is that NaissanceE can be a frustrating experience despite the short length of the game. The game should have provided more visual guidelines to help you find the way to go on, sometimes you find yourself trying to find your way through a series of jumps that lead to many deaths, as a result, the trial and error formula creates a sense of boredom and detachment from the game. It is a pity because as I mentioned before the game does a wonderful job sucking you in.\n\nAnother element which makes the game very tedious is the breathing mechanic, you have to press the left mouse button every two steps in order to keep running, if you fail to do so you will stop and will need a bit of time to recover from the effort. I understand the will to make this game a realistic experience but from a player's perspective this aspect of the game is a gimmick, it doesn't bring any fun to the table.\n\nAll in all, NaissanceE is an interesting experience which could have been more satisfying if the gameplay was better.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/notsue/recommended/265690/","notsue","I'm Not Sue","http://steamcommunity.com/id/notsue/","465 products in account","I picked up this game in a Humble Bundle after seeing the potential in its atmosphere from some of the screenshots a few months prior. For a few bucks its okay... but kind of lacking in too many departments to be enjoyable on many of its aspects.\n\nThe game's core elements are platforming + puzzles, and atmosphere. There is no story at all, despite the fact that an opening cutscene depicts the player running from some black blocky streaming through the air and then telling the player that '(name) is lost'. I actually forget the protagonists name, because it and the black thing were never relevant in the game once. The black creature showed up exactly once in a fantasia-esq musical scene 15 minutes before the end of the game with a white stream-creature and they both flew off into the sky. There are no other characters in the game, no writings, or lore in any discernable form. So you have to judge the game on its other two aspects.\n\nThe puzzles and platforming make up the only 'game' element. Unfortunately, this also is lacking in a lot of ways. The pacing and nature of the game's puzzles don't really seem to build on each other at all. In some ways that's not necessarily wrong, but it really makes the game feel strange. The opening of the game has a few simple puzzles, followed by a lot of walking and platforming and platforming and more platforming and even more platforming, and then you do a few small to medium puzzles back to back before its back to platforming for a while chapter, and then no platforming at all until the very end of the game where it is only platforming. The platforming is more or less solid as long as things arent moving, and when platforms are moving its fairly solid still but occasionally you will be unable to perceive where a moving platforming should be properly traversed, leading to some annoying deaths. The end chapter is more or less a platforming boss, which will require a lot of grinding to beat as you will have very little idea of what to run or jump to in order to continue in a several phases. Perception seems to be an issue here, even if not an often occurring one. Puzzles are more or less easy, only two require you to stop for more than a few moments to solve, usually because you have to see if your inputs created the right outputs. The game seems to have some optional areas one can enter, but unfortunately two of them were more or less trap rooms with no exit until the player tries some random thing in order for a door to open. These were pretty unfun as there was no point to go into them in the first place; the exit is where the player entered. Another specific puzzle gave the player a choice of a stark black or white room, flashing shadows or lights for a fraction of a second to show an otherwise hidden path. This was disgustingly eye-straining and whomever had the idea for this shouldve been put in check for it, and in no way should this have made it into the game in the form it is.\n\nAtmosphere is... mixed. The scale of the residential areas is genuinely impressive, but leads to vertigo as the downward climb chapter has the player scaling down a huge vertical shaft along cliffsides where these residences are. The game gives a feeling of unease in some of the more 'residential' type environments simply because of the emptiness of the locale and the intentionally unsettling music, but there isn't anything to fear though as there are no other entities in the world to interact with. Lighting is well done and gives some places a good ambience, probably the most impressive thing I can say for it. However, at one middle chapter drops all the atmosphere in favor of crawling through tubes and platforming across fan shafts. Its a strange abrupt shift and feels out of place. I think overall the problem is that the lack of any real story makes the atmosphere bland and lacking, because there is no interesting context to put to it and it is too abstract to make it interesting by itself.\n\nThe game performed fine and usually ran at 30 or 60 fps depending on how much had to be rendered, but only had to hesitate to lag during major loading zones. There are a good amount of graphic options and keys are rebindable, but strangely there is no volume slider. The music isn't too loud but it still could be a problem for some. All saving is checkpoint based. The game controls well and has good KBM + Mouse implementation, but it would probably be playable with a controller if you felt like you had to. The game is short at 4-5 hours with not much replayability except to poke around for things you haven't seen before. I can't really recommend this game unless you like the visuals as that's all there is to appreciate here I think.","March 15, 2015","false","4.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The architecture is breathtaking; i've never seen anything like it. Unfortunately, the "puzzles" are so insanely frustrating that every moment of awe and wonder is immediately destroyed when you spend the next 20 minutes falling off disappearing platforms, missing jumps or running round in circles trying to find an unmarked spot that triggers an elevator. Be aware, this is not a game like Mirror's Edge or Lemma where you can see your body and grab onto ledges and enjoy the flow of parkour. This is an oldskool trial-and-error precision platformer where you jump around like a demented Quake Guy without any feet. And it's a crying shame because it has the potential to be one of the best damn walking simulators ever made. The scenery is just awesome. The music is atmospheric. The lighting is bold and fabulously alien. The second level is truly epic and brings the wildest megastructures from classic science fiction to life. Alas, i can only imagine how much more it has to offer, because after falling off a rotating crankshaft festooned with blades for the ten billionth time at the beginning of the third level i gave up.","December 20, 2015","false","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You start the game thrust into what can best be described as a very weird and strangely vacant city with awesome architecture. The devs, Limasse Five, bang on nail a feeling between alien and familiar that kept me simmering at a creeped out foreboding.\n\nYou can tell from the screens how visually strong the game is, but it's more than worth noting the fantastic sound design. Environmental sound effects carry realistically in huge open spaces and tight air vents alike and the music tracks are licensed from several professional artists that basically make the city feel even more alien, even more threatening and even more awesome at just the right moments.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, make your way through the city! The story as such is very nondescript and you're basically relying on your own interpretation of your surroundings to create whatever you like in your head. Limasse have said the game is meant to evoke a strong feeling of loneliness and that's very much a realised theme. For the most part, NaissanceE is a fairly challengeless game but certain infrequent sections will test your first person platforming skills. Though in my experience checkpoints during these bits were reasonably well spaced and aren't too much of a barrier.","December 28, 2015","true","5.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It adds a layer to the gameplay that's just a simple thing to manage while you do other platforming stuff. It never really gets in the way.\n\nEach chapter is kind of its own thing, chapter 1 does a lot of vision-based puzzles, chapter 2 is descending a massive area and might be almost half the game's length by itself, chapter 3 has some really tightrope-y platforming going on, chapter 4 is... special, though one of its segments is easily the worst moment of the game. Chapters 5 and 6... basically don't exist, and chapter 7 is a kind of annoying "final boss" sort of thing-y. The general vibe of the game is a 3D platforming and kind of walking-simulator-but-not-really and there's some puzzles along the way.\n\nThere's a bit too much of nothing happening and a fair number of weird/awkward platforming segments, especially the really awful one in chapter 4. But the game's gorgeous to look at, the atmosphere is great, and there's a constant sense of unease and tension. If you don't mind a bit of annoying gameplay, this is probably worth your time for the experience.\n\n...just, maybe not at full price, as it's not a particularly long game and there's very little replayability to it.","December 8, 2015","true","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I don't consider myself an amazing gamer or anything like that, but i felt this game was challenging enough for the average gamer to complete.\nI don't think the game was ment to be a purely exploration based game (probably why the game is getting any negativity at all since it was labled as one). Otherwise why would they even include death as a response to going the wrong way or making a huge mistake? The trial and error, the easter eggs and hidden dead ends... The fact that the only way to get a story, or rather an idea as to what is going on, is through extrapulating what the environment shows you, makes the game that much more compelling. yes you could add things to make it easier, but that doesn't always make a game better. The satisfaction of completion well outweighed the learning curve the game presented.\n\nShort version: I don't believe this game is for everyone, but i do believe anyone who can understand it's basic mechanics can complete it.

And ultimately boring.\n\nMany sections of the game are just literally too long. Corridors that go on for ages, stairs that extend for miles, and of course ladders that seem so long they're taking you to a different game, one that's interesting. Everything in the entire game would be better suited to being about half the size, many could do with being much less. Too many times have I been left just mindlessly holding the 'W' button hoping for something to happen: A puzzle to liven up the journey, something that can kill me to provide some challenge, a change in the scenery maybe? When I'm looking for something to kill me then maybe the game is a little too boring, just perhaps. Basically this game really only has about one to two hour's worth of gameplay but ends up being five or six hours long. That's about four hours of sprinting... and don't get me started on that damn breath mechanic.\n\nAs for the puzzles that do appear (far too infrequently for my taste, I know it's an exploration game but I don't define exploration as walking in the only direction available) I feel that they are also overlong, every puzzle is basically copy-pasted three or four times so you need to solve the puzzle then do that again a few more times because you haven't met the required time wasting quota for today. As for the difficulty of puzzles... they are not, but there is never any indication of what to do, at all. Many times have I looked at an obvious puzzle and thought "I know what needs to be done in order to get past this but I have no idea where the beginning actually is", and that's the game isn't it: no real content but just enough ambiguity to distract you from the truth which is that there is really no actual challenge or novelty to be found.\n\nFollowing on from my point about there being no direction; There are many "possible" options/paths/whatever for any given situation but because the game is annoyingly linear only one will ever yield fruit, the others will either be dead ends or death, with really no way of realising until you try them and arbitrarily choose the correct path... and there again is the game: An interactive medium with different possibilities but only one right answer, because the developers couldn't be bothered to anticipate player actions. And so again I have many times thought "do I go this way or that way, both seem viable but I know this game only considers one to be correct" and this causes more time wasting because you must venture quite far down a path that leads nowhere and then backtrack all the way to go down the right one. The worst area for this is in a huge square desert area a few kilometers wide... with one ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ place of importance that shows no signs of being any different from all of the other ruins there, so make sure you're facing the right direction when you start walking aimlessly because you will have to turn around and just keep walking.\n\nBut the end of the game is the worst, what could be generously be considered the boss "battle" (you can only run away, get too close and it's insta-death for you friendo) involves running through a pitch black area that is constantly moving and rotating (some parts require you to straight up stop and wait for a platform to lower becuase your frantic escape from the murderous anomaly was a little too fast for the games liking, which obviously breaks immersion and throws pacing out of a twelfth story window) you will need to make several 'leaps of faith' which, by the way, need to made in the correct direction and force or you overshoot the target you can't actually see and then die! this is why the game is frustrating: it provides no indication of where you should be going, provides multiple paths, and kills you when you choose the wrong one... you idiot, it was obviously a little more to the left, can't you tell, I put all of that darkness there just to show you! -_-\n\nGameplay: there is none.\n\nSeriously, it's just walk or sprint if you can bear the tedious breath mechanic that requires you to click the mouse every second or so... but you never run out of breath so if you keep clicking in time you can't sprint indefinitely. That's it: run, jump, and maybe activate something on a rare occasion. There's nothing to collect, no actual reason to continue even, we never find out what our motivation is, this places seems like a city of sorts in many places why can't just live here? What reason do I have to propell the protagonist forwards other than the fact that I paid for this damn game so I might as well try and get my monies worth out of it. There is no treasure to collect, no world to save, no friend to rescue, there was that thing we were running from in the beginning but that never, ever, comes back until the "boss battle" at the end... I genuinely do not understand why the character is doing this, why they're even here or where they're going! Walking forwards for the sake it is a bad idea, try that in the real world and you find yourself very wet soon enough, I'm not going to leave my house and just keep walking, even for the sake of 'exploration', do you know what I'd explore? The Atlantic that's what.\n\nAnd finally for exploration well there are some nice vistas no and then but that's it, nothing to find, no lore, no people, no treasure, no challenge, no nothing, at all, ever, not even any colours. If beautiful vistas are what you want then play another game, 80% of them have great views and beautiful scenery that involves more than creamy-grey cubes made in literally any game engine or modelling software. I honestly could have made this game myself in a month on my own, I can't draw but there are no texture so no worries there, I can't model but everything is just a cuboid with the default grey-rubbery texture anyway, the audio might be tricky but I'm sure I can find the metal scraps to bang together to recreate it... And the game itself? Well I might have a degree in video game design & development but I doubt I'd need it to make preschool-esque puzzles and huge blank areas full of cement boxes, but that's just my opinion.\n\nI think this game would be actually quite decent if they didn't try to actually drag it out so much, not fantastic but I could enjoy it for the views but I have gotten  bored while playing this so much and I really just don't care about the main character, I don't give a ♥♥♥♥, they do not matter to me. A bit of narrative would have been welcome, in any form really, voiceover, diary entries, graffiti explaining what happened, anything to liven up the dull areas and make me actually care about the game or protagonist at all. But most of all I think there should be rewards, stuff to find or do, I don't care if I can use the rewards I just need to know that the last five minutes of my life spent running down an empty corridor only to realise it was a dead end wasn't completely in vain. But that's just me, maybe you'll enjoy living the futility of having no purpose, direction, or impact.\n","October 31, 2015","false","5.1"," No ratings yet 2 people found this review funny","0","0","0","0","3"

It's certainly an immersive exploration game first and foremost, and it does not force its own explanations on you - it's open to interpretation.\n\nIts distinct aesthetics of a seemingly sterile, "underdeveloped" world are very well realized. When you find pockets of high detain in the world they look bizzare and unnerving, even though they are closer to "reality" than low detail shapes of most of the world.\n\nWhat the developers absolutely nailed is a sheer sense of scale of the environments. Without resorting to VR, you feel small and lost in its fractal-like vast environments. It's probably the only non-VR game that triggered my fear of heights - so tangible the scale is. It's a world where you are just a speck, passing through.\n\nOh, I wish I could take a look at this in VR. Sadly, and not developers' fault, the framework they build the game on is something Oculus only supported with DK1.\n\nPacing in the game differs wildly. One moment you are slowly traversing its terrain, taking it all in; the next moment you're running for your life from an environment threat with the soundtrack pounding the rhythm in your ears. By the way, soundtrack deserves a mention - it's eerie and fitting.\n\nIf I were to criticize the game, I would say that the difficulty spike in its last segment is unwarranted and was a source of immersion-breaking frustration. Also, don't expect the game to be very long - one can finish it in one long sitting.\n\nIt's linear, but I expect to return to it now and then. Only to see the sights again.

This is an interactive art. In NaissanceE, you will explore haunting but beautiful world which lacks a sign of life. Sanity even. At first time I played this, I was chilled and amazed its beauty. If you love surreal paintings such as Giorgio de Chirico, this one is for you.","May 20","true","14.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Most of the difficulty is from platforming sections that took me hours but would take a mildly competent chimpanzee only one or two tries, or walking around sections that are too surreal to tell where to go.  And it's a bit too linear to be called exploration.   But the vistas are magnificent and the music fits them perfectly, so I definitely recommend this for that alone.  Just make sure you buy it on sale, the game is really, really short.","May 22","true","4.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
