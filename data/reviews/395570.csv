I figured I'd give it a short review first to get the basics out of the way, then add on to it as I play more.\n\nQuick Basic Points:\n- Graphics are pretty good for an isometric game.\n- Starts off tougher then most isometric strat games requiring the use of more tactical means on avoiding/taking out enemies.\n- Enemies start off hitting hard but their game sense isn't to bright (On the first 2 levels).\n- Enviroment plays a huge role in most cases\n- The overall theme is familar yet unique in its own way. Isn't just a copy of "insert strat isometric rpg here"\n-The tutorial is a bit barebones but helpful enough to not die to much\n- The classes are rather interesting with their skills sets.\n- Skill sets for each class is a bit fresh compared to the generalized skills sets you find in rpgs.\n- Movement can be annoying since there are moments where the movements don't register with the mouse.\n- The cool down system isn't to bad (It is a little tedious at the beginning)\n- There are a couple glitches/bugs I ran into that made things a little more tedious then they should be. Nothing to the point to where it made me rage quit. (Small things that i'm sure are going to be fixed soon)\n\nI'm only about 10 hours into the game and I have to say I'm enjoying it. It was a bit rocky to start with because I wasn't prepared for how challenging the game is. Once you get the hang of it (by the third or so level) It's not to tough. Still requires tactics and a good amount of logical thinking. From time to time the characters will be a tad unresponsive causing some unneeded deaths but it hasn't happened enough for me to stop playing the game. It's worth the cost of being under $15 there is potiential for more then one play through so far.","February 26","true","10.3"," 85 of 115 people (74%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","74","85","115","4","6"

Being it solo or in a full group, this game difficulty sits on a razor's edge and will punish you a lot. Forcing you to reload to the last checkpoint.\n\nStill, once you get past the frustation and you learn the best path to get through a level, it's like something clicks inside your brain and you know what to do and then you'll challenge your self by trying to find the best possibile approach in order to save armor.\nYour see, your job is not just to maul down the enemies, but to get past them in the most efficient way possible, the game rewards good strategists with its armor system. The less hits you take, the more armor you can save, and the more armor the less damage you take and the higher the chances for you to success. This idea is also part of its upgrade system, which often forces you to take the optional, hardest part to beat of a level, in order to gain one of those gem stones necessary to upgrade your dwarves.\nGiving them a better chance in the future.\n\nThe enemies are hard to deal with not only because they hit like a truck, but because each type has a different kind of beheviour and each enemy has probably a sub grup among them as well, swords, rifleman and so on. Oh, and they communicate with each other as well, so one wrong pull and the whole room is after you.\nThe enviroments and it's traps, bushes, ledges and checkpoints play a huge role in the fights as well.\nYea, it's hard. Very hard. But once you figure out the best path to take, the best position to hold and the best abilities to fire at the right time, all the frustation you accumulated so far turns into joy as the enemies lie down before you, and you took the minimal amount of damage possible.\n\nOverall, it's an enjoyable yet challenging game, your best tactic is to learn the levels, the enemy beheviour, your character skills and use enviroment at your advantage. Then try and die as many times as it takes.\nIt's difficult but rewarding, and I personaly recommand it.","February 27","true","17.9"," 33 of 39 people (85%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","85","33","39","6","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gamesear/recommended/395570/","gamesear","Gamesear","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gamesear/","31 products in account","We are the Dwarves is a stylish but brutally difficult real-time tactical adventure where you take control of a trio of Dwarven astronauts on a mission that has gone terribly wrong, leaving them stranded in the stony void between the stars.\n\nIt features some truly alien landscapes filled with devious traps, cunning enemies and lots of ways to show off your personal skill. While all of that is incredibly fun the roller-coaster of a difficulty curve made my experience with We are the Dwarves a lot more frustrating than it needed to be, especially in the tutorial which is ironically the hardest part of the entire game.\n\nPositives:\nThe Setting\nWe are the Dwarves takes place in a universe where the void between the stars is not empty, instead it is full of diverse landscapes and equally diverse critters adapted to living in such conditions. This might not sound like a big deal but the intriguing setting and the urge to see what's next was a major motivator for me when I got stuck on a particularly difficult section. As an example, the most interesting creature I've run across is the Star Parasite, a gigantic crystalline being that feeds off energy and distorts gravity as well as reality around itself which results in some trippy, but memorable, visuals.\n\nDwarven Balance\nIn these types of games it is of the utmost importance to have all members of the team equally useful and for the most part We are the Dwarves manages to do that. The melee front-liner Smashfist is the hardest one to position without dying but once in place he can deal with an almost endless supply of enemies. Forcer, your ranged powerhouse, excels at dealing tons of damage through the use of his shotgun but since friendly fire is a thing you will need to practice a bit of restraint instead of just blasting away. The final Dwarf is Shadow who transforms the action in to a competently done stealth game. He is your scout and assassin, tasked with clearing the way before you bring in the big guns and out of all the Dwarves he is my favourite given how much of an impact he can have.\n\nSmart AI\nYou know how in most stealth games when you kill a guard in broad daylight everyone just forgets about it in 10 seconds? Not the case in We are the Dwarves. If the enemy spots a body they will start screaming and raise a camp-wide alarm which means that every single nook, cranny and bush will be searched through as they attempt to find the assassin among them. Similarly, when you shoot enemies in combat they don't tend to stand still and take it. Instead they will attempt to circle you, dodge your attacks or just outright run away in order to avoid your melee blows.\n\nThe Combat\nWhen you combine a well balanced trio of Dwarves with smart enemies you get some incredibly fun combat where the tactical options presented to you are endless. You can throw caution (and your life) to the wind and simply charge them, or you can use Shadow to pick off a few of the more annoying ranged enemies before going in, or perhaps even lure the enemies in to a carefully prepared kill-box, the choices are there.\nOnce the fight does break out the action can get a bit hectic at times so its a good thing that We are the Dwarves offers you the ability to pause the game at any point in order to line up your shots or to simply think about strategy. I would recommend you do so because while your Dwarves are powerful there is no way you'll be able to adapt to enemy movement and attacks in real-time given how much they like to dance about the battlefield.\n\nNegatives:\nThe Difficulty Roller-coaster\nThis is by far and wide the biggest problem in We are the Dwarves. Given that all enemies are balanced around you having three Dwarves at your disposal the times where the game asks you to fight them with 2, or even 1, are just nightmarishly difficult and endlessly frustrating. The worst part of it is the fact that the hardest levels in the entire game are found in the tutorial section where you don't even have access to all of your abilities and are somehow expected to fight off hordes of enemies.\n\nWriting\nWhile the setting had me immersed in no time the writing made cringe, and I'm pretty sure that's the result of a translation gone wrong. The dialogue and lore is written in such a way that almost all of the emotion behind the words is completely gone. Which is a shame because the developers went through a lot of effort to add codex entries about every single location and enemy you meet so to have all of that be flawed in some way is unfortunate.\n\nOccasional Clunkiness\nThese aren't big issues because they doesn't strike often but its well worth mentioning. We are the Dwarves doesn't do "in-between" shots very well so sometimes you might find yourself wildly flailing the mouse trying to have your ability target two enemies close to each other. The second problem is that sometimes the game refuses to let you cancel your ability until you mash the button a couple of times which usually doesn't matter but in combat can be deadly.\n\nPotential Memory Leak\nI'm leaving this as last because it could be related to my rig but after playing We are the Dwarves for over an hour my FPS will begin steadily decreasing and the load times that once took less than a second will go up to 10. Restarting the game fixes these issues so I'm suspecting a memory leak but since I'm running off a sample size of 1 I won't make any claims, just be mindful of this while playing.\n\nMy Recommendation:\nWe are the Dwarves is going to be a very divisive game. It is hard and occasionally frustrating but also fun and compelling with that Dark Souls feeling of triumph once you get through an impossibly difficult section. I enjoyed my time with We are the Dwarves and even though it made me angry more than once I don't regret playing it.\n\nWhat I would suggest you do is to first ask yourself whether you're ok with dying upwards of 20 times on a single level before you figure it out. If the answer is no then We are the Dwarves is not the type of game for you and you will simply lose your mind playing through it. If the answer is yes then I'd suggest using Steam to demo the game for up to two hours because if you can play through that and say "I had fun" then I do believe you'll enjoy the rest of We are the Dwarves as well as it only gets better from there.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E44mTFXjxSo","February 26","true","11.0"," 41 of 54 people (76%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","76","41","54","3","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DarkSoad/recommended/395570/","DarkSoad","DarkSoad [Curator]","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DarkSoad/","383 products in account","We Are The Dwarves: a dangerous journey\nThe team Whale Rock Games, after years of working on numerous games like Dragon Age Inquisition, S.T.A.L.K.E.R., Metro: LastLight, among others, decided to embark themselves into their first independent title called We Are The Dwarves.\n\nThe Accident: story and characters description\nWe Are The Dwarves tells the story of a group of three dwarves, who are forced to fight for their lives in a unknown planet. Struggling to avoid extinction, these survivors share the same goal: find a new Star for their people and the entire race.\n\nLost in the Stone Universe after an accident with the ship, the dwarves are left to examine and discover this land, while they are start communicating with each other in order to regroup. This is were our adventure starts, and it's not going to be an easy one.\n\nThe main characters are Forcer, Smashfist and Shadow, and each of them play a different role in the game, carrying unique weapons, abilities and combat style.\nForces focuses on range weapons, dealing damage from a distance or in close quarters with a shotgun-type shot.\nSmashfist, on the other hand, is the melee expert in the group and an expert in smashing heads with his two hammers.\nAnd finally, Shadow is, as his name indicates, a stealth specialist. The dwarf carries two daggers and can silently approach enemies from behind.\n\nGetting out alive: abilities, use of enviroment and difficulty\nEach one of the astronauts have different abilities according to their specialization, which can work in sinergy if we make a plan beforehand.\n\nWe Are The Dwarves belongs to the RTS genre, and in the game we will control each dwarf through different levels and areas that are excellent detailed and offer different paths and secrets to find. But the most important feature, it's how we can make use of the enviroment to defeat the alien races. Either by shooting an explosive plant or by throwing enemies off a cliff, there is always a different way to defend ourselves. But be careful, the enemies can detect us using their senses like hearing or smelling, and they often flank and communicate with each other.\n\nAnd we are thankful for that, because We Are The Dwarves is not an easy game. It takes some time to get used to it, primarly on the first levels, where two patrol enemies can end our lives if we are not careful enough. The astronauts are often slower than most enemies, abilities have cooldowns and they are always exposed to danger in this strange planet.\n\nEach level have small tasks to achieve, plants that can heal us completely and stations where we can upgrade the characters stats by using the materials we gather in the scenarios. It is not a complex leveling system, but you can improve different aspects of each character in the way it better suits your play style.\n\nStepping into an unknown planet: graphics and art style\nWe Are The Dwarves is shown in a wonderful 3D engine that has a strange style and use of colors, which helps the game feel truly unique. There are different types of enemies and tribes with unique forms and the regions and level design never gets boring to the player.\nLighting is also an important aspect, light and dark are often present in each level and we can use them to maintain our characters out of danger. There are also cutscenes and the three astronauts have a lot of detail on them.\n\nOur journey has just begun: the verdict\nWe Are The Dwarves it's a very solid RTS, but also a difficult one. If we are not used to plan strategies and take it slow, we will end up having a rough time. It has an unique lore and art style that we'll love from the very first minutes and offers plenty of hours of content.\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","April 21","true","7.6"," 27 of 31 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","27","31","0","11"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/monkeystyxx/recommended/395570/","monkeystyxx","D-Lyrium","http://steamcommunity.com/id/monkeystyxx/","199 products in account","(I have two or so additional hours gameplay on a friend's account in addition to that shown here)\n\nPositives:\n- Really fun and challenging core gameplay. This is a difficult game. You will die. A lot. But the game is designed around that. Rather than huge, expansive levels, they're split up into sections, and each section presents it's own challenge.\n- Fantastic setting and world, including very pretty and unique environments.\n- Death is potentially around every corner (even in the tutorial) and it's a lot more strategy based than your average tactical combat game. Think of it more like a real-time X-Com than a traditional action RPG.\n- I love the way the environment plays a part in the tactics of the game. Not only the traditional 'exploding barrels' and 'cover' mechanics (though obviously they exist), but also natural hazards and other effects which really add to the overall atmosphere and challenge of the gameplay.\n- Each dwarf's 'class' has a different mechanic, some of which lead to unique effects and playstyles. For example, several of the marksman's abilities cause recoil, which leads to him being pushed backwards when he takes a shot. You have to be careful near cliff edges, as it's perfectly possible to recoil off the edge and die.\n- I also love the 'senses' mechanic. Enemies don't only detect you by seeing you. Some can 'feel' vibrations in the earth, and some can hear you, or smell you. As you'd expect, each enemy has different sensitivites of each sense (some can't see you, for instance, but hear better). Moving in short bursts causes less noise and movement, and you can wait for their awareness to die down before moving again. Once an enemy senses you, it'll come and investigate the area it heard/felt/smelled you (unless it can clearly see you, in which case it'll run over and attack immediately). This plays into the environment features too, as some flora and fauna will react to your presence by making noise/emitting a smell, which in turn will attract enemies. It's a fantastic system.\n- Also has good music, and great ambient sounds for the flora/fauna which make for a great atmosphere.\n\nNegatives:\n-  Very badly localised. Many, many typos and spelling errors. To be expected, I guess, from a self-published first game from eastern european indy developers, but even so...\n- The UI in general seems unpolished and a bit rough around the edges. No worse than most games from, say, Focus Interactive... but it definitely could use some tidying up.\n- The voice acting, while it is refreshing to hear some different accents from the usual American, British or American-Trying-To-Be-Russian/German/Italian/Spanish, is a little dull in terms of performance (aside from the first character you meet, who is pretty good). This is not helped by the script, of course, which is very hammy and suffers from not being written in the writer's native language (or, if it was, badly translated). It's not a huge problem, but it's worth mentioning.\n- The collectible items in the game are all rather small and can be extremely hard to see at times, and this isn't helped by the fact that you have to click on them specifically in order to pick them up (as opposed to just being able to walk through them and collect them). This makes some of the 'collect X resources before continuing' sections very frustrating as I just could NOT find the last damn resource, and it turned out it was in a really obvious place I'd walked past about 5 times, just didn't see it.\n- No rebindable keys! Really?! Come onnnnnn. In fairness, the game uses a MOBA style QWERT system, with movement controlled by the mouse. So it could be argued that it's not really necessary. I just hate using Alt, as it's really awkward to press if your fingers are resting on QWERT.\n- Inability to zoom the camera, while possibly a specific design decision, is a little annoying.\n- The movement controls feel a bit clunky. Sometimes your dwarf doesn't end up moving anywhere, or moves to the wrong place, or takes an expected route through dangerous terrain. It's not horrible by any means, but it could be improved.\n\nOverall though, the actual gameplay is excellent, and if you're the type of person who doesn't care too much about the writing and voice acting, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend the game to you. Especially as the typos and grammar are very easy to fix, and doubtless will be in due time.","February 26","true","3.4"," 23 of 30 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","23","30","0","0"

That is, if you can make any sense of the broken english. The game is littered with gems such as "Darkness - A way of getting rid of perishable body to feel lightness and timelessness" and a frankly appalling number of typos (and this applies to everything. Menus, tooltips, dialogue, codex entries... if it's written, it's written badly). You can wrangle meaning out of most of it, but it just takes you right out of the setting, especially when it's coupled with the absolutely atrocious voice acting. It feels like two of the devs decided they could record every character, so there's a nice layer of terrible accents over the broken grammar.\nMarring the presentation even further is a large number of visual and sound glitches (objects making no sounds, cutscenes cutting out too fast or too slow) and you end up with a game that is constantly pulling you out of the experience with its clumsiness.\n\nThe gameplay is actually good when it's not being brought down by baffling design decisions and poorly communicated mechanics. The game is quite challenging, which is good, but a lot of the challenge also comes from fighting with the controls and interface (with abilities not triggering properly, doing unexpected stuff, cover not concealing correctly, etc...). You're expected to die a lot, rinse and repeat, but a lot of your deaths feel like the game mechanics are screwing you over instead of a challenge to overcome.\n\nStill, when everything is in full swing, there is definitely an enjoyable experience there, and when you get all the synergies going it's very satisfying. Sadly, a lot of the time you'll just be dying and going "wtf." I enjoy stealth games, and don't mind replaying the same level over and over until I get it perfect, and yet this game just ended up a mostly frustrating experience.\nIt feels like a lot like Commandos back in the day, except with none of the polish those games developed over the years.\n\nBit of a shame really.\n","April 4","false","9.5"," 18 of 24 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","18","24","0","0"

During dwarves I struggled with contrls first 3 or 4 levels and then got accustomed, but with DAI I was frustrated with poor camera and controls during the whole game. So, I believe people just have steep demands to this nice small indie project.\n\nMy conclusion is: If you like tactical games such as Blackguards, XCOM, Banner Saga etc. - you deffinitely want to experience "We are Dwarves".

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/recommended/395570/","Steamified","Warwick J.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/","3916 products in account","We Are The Dwarves is an action adventure game and marks the Steam debut of Whale Rock Games. It is arguably one of the most unique and challenging games that Steamified has featured to date. Despite it being the first game as a development studio you may not want to fool yourself into thinking that this game has been created by industry newbies because you couldn’t be any further from the truth. The studio has some of the more important talent responsible for working on such high profile games as EverQuest, Elder Scrolls Online and S.T.A.L.K.E.R. The latter of the three we recently featured on the Steamified Countdown with its Shadow of Chernobyl and the first of which due to its legendary status is still to come.\n\nLearning the control scheme and the tools and abilities provided to you will take some time. You may even die early and often. The game is challenging, purposefully so. I would ask you to persevere and to not give up on the game because there’s a real beauty to it once you have learned the basics. There’s a thorough combination of stealth, of real-time tactical combat and in a way action RPG – think Diablo and Torchlight – as well as CRPG and although it takes time to learn it is a big accomplishment for an indie team. It’s the type of combination that I believe that we will be seeing a lot more of in the future.\n\nInstead of controlling just one dwarf you get to control of three – Forcer, Smashfist and Shadow. They each have their own different unique qualities and their names tend to give you a strong idea of what they will be. Smashfist was my favorite and his tutorial level, which is what I’d like to think of it as being although the devs may argue otherwise, is second following Forcer and arguably one of the most difficult but rewarding a character’s introduction that I have seen in a long time. He begins with such little health that if you make a wrong mistake you’re pretty much going to be reloading that save immediately – don’t worry about saving right before his arrival as thankfully enough there is an autosave. To throw you a hint… the first couple of mobs that you see in that level features one on a rock and one in front of him but lower. Do not even consider attacking them. What you need to do is to ensure that you avoid them – the one on the rock will turn and if you’re within seeing distance they will come after you and will kill you. Stealthily get past him and then use your special ability – you’re given a tutorial on how to use it – on the next bad guy who is looking away from you. You’ll turn him into chop suey if you’ve learned the skill and you can progress.\n\nThe graphics for the game are absolutely superbly executed. They are a sure fire way to help you get immersed into the game immediately. The planet is dark and gloomy and this establishes the mood of the game. It’s a screenshot creator’s dream game whenever you can pause the game long enough to take some of the more scintillating pictures imaginable. The gorgeous backgrounds and stunning panoramas. The soundtrack and the sounds in general are a great accompaniment to this marvelous soup for the gaming soul.  Do not play the game on silent mode because you will need to rely on your ears as much if not more than your eyes. If you fail to pay enough attention you will be slaughtered from the stealth-like attacks from your opponents as they appear from the shadow. This could have been avoided had you paid attention to the sound of the game as you hear the slightest of footsteps coming toward you.\n\nThe biggest downside is the brutal difficulty almost right from the start. I know I mentioned how difficult it was earlier in this feature but it’s the truth. If you’re a casual player then chances are you’ll probably quit the game before you ever get far enough into it to make it worth your while. But for those of you who are prepared to stick with it will discover a very deep and rewarding experience. It’s just those first few levels that you’re going to have to grind through and accept that you will die a lot. It can also be argued that despite the number of tutorial messages that pop up that you’re not given enough information early enough to help guide you through this part of the game.\n\nKudos to the development team who had also taken much of what was said about the game in the pre-launch and early post-launch reviews and have worked hard on either fixing or improving the game. It is clear to me that this new dev studio of theirs works tirelessly on what they would consider to be their passion projects. More and more these days we are witnessing hugely talented developers walk away from AAA developers and publishers in  order to work on what they truly want to work on. It’s something that I can appreciate because it appears to be where the greatest amount of innovation is coming from. That’s not to insult the big brand companies especially those with shareholders who expect big profits so they are somewhat forced to stick with what is tried and true. Should they try something as unique and full of potential as We Are The Dwarves and have it fall flat on their faces their would be major issues. In many ways it’s an example of just how massive the industry has become.\n\nA beautiful, glorious world that is made even more rewarding by some of the most challenging, yet beatable, gameplay I have ever experienced. A hearty recommendation for I am a Dwarf.\n\nLate Addition: You can now change to a lower difficulty level within the in game menu\n\nFor similar reviews and our popular daily giveaways visit http://www.steamified.com/\nPlease feel free to join our wonderful community on Steam","March 9","true","6.5"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

I really like the fact that the areas are small and require you to die a few times to figure them out. A lot of things can be interacted with for cover and distractions too. One thing that adds to the thinking needed to complete a level is how each creature has it's own strengths and weaknesses with how they sense you, and I think it's great.","March 19","true","20.6"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

I died and still do, a lot. The game requires a lot of patience and planning before you make a move. The enemies uses their senses to find you, they listen, smell and look for you. Once they have located you they do crazy damage near the start. You need to make the maximum use of the terrian to help you. During the first few levels I kept dying until I realised my one gun shot caused knock back so I could knock whole groups of cliffs without taking a single hit.\nControls have led to a few frustrations from me with most the game being controlled by left or right click.\nIf you love the idea of an action/adventure game where combat requires tactical thought then I'd give We Are The Dwarves a serious look.","February 26","true","1.1"," 18 of 30 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","18","30","0","0"

If you feel like you know everything about hardcore games, made it through Dark Souls, Super Meat Boy, using a keypad, beaten Shao Khan in MK4 Ultimate, when you were 8 years old and such, then go ahead and try and to beat the first several levels, which are meant to be tutorials :) Don't get me wrong here, the controls are wonderful and once you get used to them and as you progress through the game and gain access to the entire team of dwarven astronauts, that is when We Are The Dwarves starts to sparkle in all its' beauty and power. That is when the title of the game comes to mind - beating every next level using a team work, yelling at the defeated enemies on the screen, calling yourself "We Are Dwares" with the raised eyebrows of your girlfriend, who is just passing by. Big kudos to developers for the stealth missions and Shadow is my favourite character.

Brutally hard. and normally, i am not a guy to shy away from hard gameplay. Especially when it's coupled with an interesting theme and aesthetic.\nSo i didn't shy away from We are the Dwarves. I dove into it's seemly tactical and slow paced gameplay with determination and a knowledge that i would die often but i would also learn the game as it progressed.\nI  was wrong.\n\nLets break it down.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRdMNsrp-RA\n\n\n\nThe game looks performs fine, i've had 60FPS always with no issues outside of drops while the game saves. but outside of the audio options, the options menu is abysmally sad missing all but a basic choice of presets.\nNot even having a choice of windowed or full screen or the ability to alter anything regarding fidelity.\nAlso, the ingame camera angle is locked, which doesn't  help the gameplay in any way.\n\n\nAlso I was wrong on the game being tactical. It's only tactical when it actually does what you tell it.\nThe Ai & dwarves have randomized elements to them (such as knockdown chance) or when they might call back-up to pile up on you. coupled with a very limited health pool, a sparring amount of save points AND the dwarves sometimes just blatantly ignoring commands...\nIt all brings it a layer of randomized frustration that it boils the blood in the same way your mother in law does.\n\nWhile i'm sure the games story is great,  the above coupled with the hellish difficulty (which you cant change) made me not even get past chapter 1, and as such I've lost and all desire to play this game further.\n\nNow, when the games mechanics work, and the AI isn't being idiotically unfair, then the combat and tactical aspects shine through. But sadly... that's to far and to few in between, and when you've fought the same 4 mobs for 20 tries before that happens, the usual joy of beating a tough fight isn't there... all there is left is the frustrating knowledge you will just repeat this on the next set of mobs and no tactics you think of will chance anything.","February 26","false","18.1"," 51 of 99 people (52%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","52","51","99","2","1"

I am a ways into this game and, as much as it pains me to say, I can't recommend this game. For the moment. The main reason I can't recommend it is because of the bugs. The technical bugs and the control bugs. The controls on this game are just bad. It's just clunky and clumsy. You click on something and it's unresponsive. Saving features dissapears(And Yes I know even when enemies are not aggrod. It sometimes just dissapears all togetherI know the mechanic.) Sometimes the journal functions dissapear. I had a bug once when trying to change the key controls and it wouldnt let me exit out. I had to ctrl-alt-del. Enemies shoot through walls, The dwarves get stuck on a plant and you have to click 4 times on something just to get it to work everynow and then. Then there are the crashes. It's so annoying having done a task after many reloads only to have it crash after you did it. This is the games major downfall.\n\nWith all that said. I still like it. The reasons: It's got great challange. The difficulty is very hard but in a fun way, not a BS way. In a time where games are all cutscenes and hand holding this is a fresh breath of air. It's fun learning and pulling things off your own way. Also the atmosphere of the game. It's very unique and cool. It looks good. I am also a huge mark for dwarves as is. These 3 are badass, but their voices SUCK. The voice acting is awful but I am a bit wiser. It's indie and understandable. No blame on the actors.\n\nI just can't recommend this game right now until a patch or a fix or something. It's just to poorly executed. I hate to love it but I love to hate it.","March 11","false","5.6"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

Sometims can't click/select enemy even mosue on it.\n\nActually there're still some detail problem in this game. but I think to make a immediate and reliable control is the most basic and important thing for this game right now.

The controls are clumsy/clunky, sometimes even unresponsive or at a very slow delay. Camera control would be a great thing to add to this game, becuase the evniorment sometimes blocks the view and obscures your screen. Also I tried to change some key layouts a few times  and I wasn't able to exit back to the game unless I closed the game completely. And its also crashed on me a few times just looking at the options screen.\n\nI really enjoy this game, its so fun but as of its current state I cant recommend it until a patch/update has been put to fix some of these issues.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/8bitzombi/recommended/395570/","8bitzombi","8-Bit Zombie","http://steamcommunity.com/id/8bitzombi/","60 products in account","When WatD first released I offered up a fairly scathing review; two patches and a half dozen game hours later I am returning to offer my second opinion.\n\nFirst off I would like to say that I don't enjoy WatD whatsoever... Mind you this is not due to a fault of the game, though it does have it's share of faults which I will cover below, but rather due to my misconception of what I imagined the game to be based on early trailers. It is easy to look at the isometric view in combination with it's seamingly fast paced combat and character classes shown in the the trailer and immediately think of something along the lines of a Diablo-like with a pause feature that allows you to que up attacks and strategize; the truth is that WatD couldn't be further from a rogue-like dungeon crawler despite it's appearance and is actually an RTT (Real-Time-Tactics) with an active pause system that strongly resembles Dragon Age Inquisition's tactical view. This has lead me to greatly dislike WatD; not because I think the game is bad, but because I do not enjoy the genre.\n\nWith that said, there is a lot of positive aspects to the game; it's lore, concept, and visual representations are all worthy of praise. The inverted universe that Whale Rock has created is truly an amazing concept, and how it links sci-fi and fantasy to offer an all new and unique setting/concept is really WatD's strong suit; this setting is complimented quite well by the stylistic, colorful, and beautifully rendered environments and some truly impressive lighting that brings it all to life.\n\nWhere WatD loses me though is it's gameplay... Part of this is due to not liking the genre, but part of it is also due to frustrating difficulty spikes, issues with control resposiveness, player movement pathing, somewhat unblanced enemy AI and mechanics, and lackluster classes each on of which I would like to talk about in a little detail since I feel most of the reviews on here haven't actually talked about the game and resort to "It's brutally hard, which makes it great!"\n\nFirst I want to talk about difficulty. Now, normally I like difficult games, in fact I am a glutton for punishment, but I am not fond of games that have inconsistent difficulty spikes; for example one part of a stage will seem like a reasonable challenge, while another part will immediately seem to be almost impossible; for example one room in a stage might be relatively simple and only require 1-3 retries while the next will have you reloading your save 20-30 times just to find a strategy that doesn't get you outright killed instantly. Moments like this feel like pulling teeth as you try and rack your mind for a solution that should work only to realize it will fail because you wrongly predicted how an enemy would react or a mechanic failed to work the way you expected and the margin for error is so low that the simplest of mistakes can mean death. These are the moments that have made me consider outright quitting on several occassions.\n\nSecondly there is the camera control, or lack of control since there is only an option to rotate around a fixed angle. I can't count how many times I wished I could freely pan the camera to get a better look at the mape and see where enemies/items are or tilt the camera down a bit to see what's directly in front of me. Beyond the lack of camera control it is also worth noting that there is no foreground transparency for environmental objects, this often means that you will find yourself with objects blocking your view from multiple angles and in some cases making it almost impossible to see what is around you at any time. Personally I would really like to see the camera moved away from RMB to rotate to something closer to XCOM's WASD to pan with Q/E to rotate, this would make controlling the camera and navigating the world outside of the active pause significantlty easier.\n\nAs a sidenote to controls player movement pathing also needs some work, one of the things that is quickly apparent in WatD is that your movement is incredibly important; staying in cover, avoiding enemy paths, sneaking past environemtal traps, etc... all of these things are necessary for your survival which is what makes the clunky click to move system a little bit frustating. I've found many occasions where I will click a location and watch my Dwarf take the worst possible path to it, or worse instances where I am controlling multiple Dwarves and one takes the safe route while the other runs straight through a camp of enemies and into a trap (or two) before reaching their destination. It's annoying and often makes me wish I had a much more accurate control of my movements.\n\nThen there are the enemies, which often feel way too fast or at times down right omnicient... One of the first things you will notice when you start playing is that your dwarves are significantly slower than most of the game's enemies, so much so that some enemies are actually impossible to target with specific dwarves, and there is nothing more frustrating than lining up and planning an attack only to realize that when it occurs the enemy you targeted is now 5-10 feet away from where they were when you started the attack. The absolute worst part of WatD's enemies is how the AI is encoded to immediately know exactly where to search for the player once they have been alerted though, even if circumstances should have made the player impossible to track. You were in cover, on the other side of the map, using an ability that mutes your actions when you fired an arrow? Guess what, as soon as enemies find the body they will know exactly where you were, and if you've moved they will be able to immediately track you to your new location. What makes this worse is that you can't do anything at all while enemies are searching for you, including saving or upgrading your character at save points or leaving the level through it's exit, and enemy AI will aggressively track you until it finds you once you've alerted them; this is by far the one aspect of the game that feels brutally unfair.\n\nMind you, dealing with difficult enemies in droves probably wouldn't be too hard if the dwarves themselves didn't appear to be the worst possible versions of fantasy video game tropes, you have: Forcer the ranger who's shotgun has a range roughly half that of all the games ranged enmies, Smashfist the tank/berserker who needs to be nearly dead to use his tank ability and pushes enemies away just as much as he draws them in, and Shadow the stealthy rogue who alerts just about every enemy on the map with each of his actions. Half of the abilites are either incredibly situational or require several upgrades to function with any efficiency while other abilities are pretty much useless, like Forcer's decoy which enemies seem to largely ignore or Smashfist's stone skin which is hardly ever available for activation since his "fury" meter rapidly drains all the time even when in battle. The result is that your dwarves often feel ill equipt for the situation they are in, and frankly pretty bad at each of their roles which can be a bit annoying...\n\nWith everything said I will say that We are the Dwarves is not a bad game, in fact it is far from it, but at the same time it is not the game I wanted or expected it to be which frankly is my problem not the game's. If you are a fan of RTT games and are looking for one that will challenge you then chances are you will be quite happy with WatD, but if you were looking for anything other than that chances are it is not for you...","February 28","true","12.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
