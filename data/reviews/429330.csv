I make a priority to get couch games for when we're together, I have to say that this is one of our new favorites.\n\nThe kids couldn't get enough of it(My played time is off, we put way more hours into it over the weekend). Usually I get to a point where its time to move on to the next local game for us to play.. I didn't with this one.\n\nThe mechanics of the game feel well balanced, I love all of the strategies you can implement to knock out your opponents. The dodge/catch mechanic works extremely well, there wasn't a time where I felt I was cheated. If I got hit, it was my own fault.\n\nThe game has a story mode that can be played with another player, and has unlockable characters. There are a few levels, but each of them feel fresh with the different themes and obstacles to avoid. I'd love more of them, but for now I'm content with whats there. Customizeable rules help to keep things interesting as well.\n\nAll in all I feel its a great game, especially at its price point. I know this will be the first game played on the next weekend we have together, and likely many more to come.","April 3","true","3.3"," 21 of 22 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","21","22","0","0"

It's bizarre love it :)\nIt's a 1970's style dodgeball game, with boss fights, random items and laughs galore. From the moment the devil kidnapped a dodgeball player I knew I was in for a bizarre gaming experience.\n\nThe basic game is a simple dodgeball based game set on a circular court but when you start to add random items, different arenas and even boss battles into the mix it turns out to be anything but a simple dodgeball game.\n\nOverall a fast paced dodgeball game that will have you stitches with its unusually quirky sense of humor.\n\n+ Multiple Arenas\n+ Boss Battles\n+ Bonus items to throw at opponents during matches\n+ Great 70's comedy feel to it, feels like a seedy 70's porno.\n+ Coop and Vs Modes.\n\n- No online multiplayer, local coop and vs only\n- Scandanavian coice over only.\n\n","April 11","true","4.8"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","2"

The game doesn't advertise multiplayer over the internet, so it is not even a scam or something like that. Anyway, Stikbold is truly a gem and this is why.\nIt is really well made. The game mechanics work flawlessly and really smooth. The game idea is pretty simple, since you play Dodgeball but it is addicting, really. You can either play with a real life friend at your house or have a CPU player as a partner which works fine. I was surprised that a sports game like this would have a story and I really enjoy it so far. It is probably only taking 90 minutes or so, but the presentation is just really neat. The great silly humor really entertains you and you are motivated to play through the whole story. You encounter a lot of funny stuff on your way to completion and after that you still have the possibility to play with your buddies together (local, of course). Another pleasant thing is the soundtrack. It is flok-ish and is really nice to listen to. Reminds me of Tiny and Big: Grandpa's Leftovers. The soundtrack varies and each stage has its own song, which is a completely new one. There are probably 16-20 stages, will edit it as soon as I am through (currently 47% after 50 minutes).","April 3","true","0.8"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","12","15","0","0"

Doesn't take much to see all this game has to offer, though. There is a campaign with levels that vary only a little (new obstacles, different game modes here and there).

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Seranth/recommended/429330/","Seranth","Seranth","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Seranth/","1189 products in account","A simple dodgeball arena game. Decent music and graphics, colorful world and uses the blocky human style similar to games like Minecraft and Thirty Flights of Loving. A decent lighthearted nonsensical story and voices are only in (although subtitles are available for multiple languages).\n\nRules are pretty simple: Game starts with the single ball dropping in the center of the arena. You can throw, pass, dodge, or catch the ball. You can also do a melee shove to make an opponent drop the ball. Two hits within a couple seconds knocks you out (permanently in harder modes or until your partner revives you in easier modes). And there are often random objects in the environment that can be thrown (only for the first hit; the ball is needed for the second hit).\n\nThe campaign is 12 missions with three optional challenges per mission (such as eliminating an opponent with a curving long shot). While the first-to-three regular dodgeball matches were fine, I had more fun with the bosses (which are less dodgeball and more action game). The AI companion is good enough as medium-skill partner (it almost always passes the ball to you to make the shot and can dodge decently) but it's not good enough to handle the harder AI or well coordinated humans. Sometimes it'll make a terrible mistake and randomly get knocked out or pass the ball to the enemy but I've made mistakes just as bad. Just don't rely on it and treat it as an extra life/a ball collector.\n\nIn the higher difficulties you have to keep your eye out for incoming projectiles and use your dodge roll perfectly. Otherwise the enemy will just hit you once your roll ends. It can just become a series of throws into catches/dodges until one side gets a lucky hit.\n\nWhile I had my x360 controller plugged in, it became the sole method of control. No option to switch controls. While fine for me (I don't keep my controller plugged in all the time), may be annoying for those who do. Controls are remappable for keyboard but not controller. The diagram showing controller controls didn't show the pass button (RB for me).\n\nUnfortunately, there is only local coop (no online multiplayer). At least you can do the campaign as coop.\n\nSome things I'd like to have:\nBetter outlined text. Sometimes the font blends together and is hard to read (Especially the red team victory screen)\nActual volume sliders instead of having to cycle through all options to lower the volume\nAn option to constrain the mouse cursor to the window in windowed mode\nAn option to automatically pause the game when it goes out of focus\nTo be able to toggle challenge descriptions instead of it disappearing and reappearing every few seconds. Makes it a little annoying to read. Or the descriptions could be separate from the flower showing if you already completed the challenge.\nWhile playing I saw some visual bugs but nothing too severe. There were some model clipping issues in cutscenes and a random scratch line across the dialogue box. Thought the scratch might have been on my actual screen but it followed the window when I moved it.\n\nWorth a look if arcadey/gamey dodgeball interests you and you don't mind the presentation/silly theme. It allows you to skip cutscenes (hold space on keyboard) if you find the story/characters grating.","April 9","true","3.7"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

I decided to do some video game reviews.

The sound effects could use a bit more variation but it hasn't yet ruined the expeirence.\n\nControls: 9 - Responsive, So far I only used the wired Xbox360 controller, not the mouse and keyboard or two player (a person on each)\n\nFun Factor: 8 - So far the game is fun, has a nice storyline and doesn't take itself all too seriously.

Sure it has its own charm with the artstyle (which I personally disliked) and humor, but it gets old quickly. The game is fun for a few hours and then it gets old, granted it might be more fun to play in co-op which I didn’t try. To play in co-op you need at least 1 extra controller and up to 3 controllers for even more players. Still, this doesn’t seem like a type of game a group of adults would choose to play. Stikbold looks like it was made for families and youth to enjoy in a casual setting. So unless you are in one of those 2 demographics, I wouldn’t recommend this game. For me it just didn’t stick.","April 29","false","5.0"," 10 of 18 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","10","18","0","0"

The game doesn't  have online multiplayer and I can't see how local multiplayer would work if you don't have a controller.

Yeah. Dodgeball. It's even officially endorsed. The game provides both a Quick Match mode, and a Story Mode. Stikbold can be played solo, but it's best played as a local co-op. This is buddy-game playing at it's finest. The story is quite funny and charming, and the music is downright funky. The gameplay is clearly desinged around a controller, although a mouse and keyboard can be used. I would suggest using a controller. The Steam Contoller works flawlessly with this, as does my Logitech. By completeing parts of the story mode (and it's various challenges!), you can unlock new players to use in the Quick Match mode of the game. QUick Match boasts two modes, one being Teams and the other being an all out Free-For-All. THese are more dodgeball related than the actual Story mode, which integrates some gameplay as well (battling a whale, dodging a VW Bus, etc)\n\nPositives:\n+ Delightfully cheerful and funny\n+ Fantastic little game for hanging with a friend\n+ Incredibly smooth and easy gameplay. Quick to pick up.\n+ Great Soundtrack\n\nNegatives:\n- Solo is fun, but gets boring after the Story Mode is complete. A lot rides on MP.\n\nI couldn't find much wrong with this little indie game. It is fun, and even made my friend that's NOT a gamer in any way give it a try and he quite enjoyed it. I'm positive you will too.It's worth about $10, and you can grab it now at 20% off. It's worth it.\n\nVerdict:\n7/10\n\nHappy Gaming!","April 1","true","3.2"," 10 of 21 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","10","21","0","1"

After a while I stoppedd and the next day I played this game with my brother with ps3 controllers. We had a lot of fun and we laughed a lot. The game has a story mode that you can play with somebody else locally or you can play it solo. In this story mode you can win new levels (maps) and new characters. The maps are really different from each other and each map adds a lot of aspect to the game. For example if you die and other people are still playing, you are still playing from the sideline for example you can throw a beach ball once in a while etc. So it's not like you are spectating the game, you are still participating.

Towerfall, Gangbeasts and now Stikbold! all fall into the "have a couple of beers with your friends, laugh and get your a$$ kicked"-category of games, which I love.\n\nStikbold!, since it's a dodgeball game, works best when played free-for-all with 3-4 people in my opinion. Everyone can play this game ("pick up the ball and shoot" isn't too hard to do), which is why I'd recommend it to families as well as friend groups. If you're a skilled gamer there are tips and tricks for you to use as well - curve balls, dodges and such.\n\nThe story mode actually surprised me, in a good way, though. It's a fun story, but should be played co-op ("no one's a team alone") if you want to unlock all achievements and get the most out of it, since the bot's a bit clueless at times and prefers to leave things up to you.\n\nLastly, it's definitely best to play this game with controllers!

It seemed like it might be fun with friends and worked just fine with my Steam controller. Today I tried it again, and it seems multiplayer is impossible since I have the "phantom controller" problem that some other people seem to have. When I try the game with just one controller, the controller works, but not with the other controller. This setup worked just fine with Rocket League, but apparently not with Stikbold.\n\nMoreover, about 50% of the time when I start the game it crashes after watching the unskippable intro credits of the 76 different groups that worked with the game. This might be a fun game, if it worked properly. Apparently this is too much to ask in current year. So no, I don't recommend Stikbold.\n\nI wanted a fun console-esque distraction.

I'm one of the few nerdy, fat, bullied kids who loved playing dodgeball in gym class. I took it as the only oportunity I had to hurt and humiliate the popular kids who made my life a living hell. I have good memories, and have always wanted to play a good dodgeball video game.\n\nMechanics are solid, this is not the dodgeball I know as you can run around freely across the playing are instead of being confined to your team's space. This allows you to not only dodge the incoming fire, but also tackle opposing players and steal the ball. (maybe this is a European version of the rules, or something the game made up on its own) Not a huge fan of the mechanics, but it is still the dodgeball I love.\n\nMy problem is the annoying aesthetics. The character models are ugly, the story is dumb, and there's just something off about the whole package. I love colorful and quirky aesthetics a lot, but this game is really rubbing me the wrong way with its approach. This might be truly subjective, but I really dislike this game.

Now it does have its flaws, and you might want to configure your controls (i had to configure the curve because C to curve was not working out for me) but other than that, you can tell it was made by Russians? (I don't know the accent, but i can tell it wasn't American.) Now i don't mind the culture of the developer, but I think he/her/them should get some dubbed actors. It's kind of sad for me to having to read during the cutscenes although, it's not that big of a deal. Now the cons are awesome, I am on a Toshba windows 10 and the graphics are amazing for this game, and i'm surprised my PC can run it in High Quality. The gameplay is pretty awesome, the characters are kind of annoying but it doesn't really matter. It's kind of a goofy game in my opinion, it doesn't have real competive wish is what i think was the dev's intention. It would be awesome if the dev had some kind online multiplayer so I can get my freinds to buy the game, when we have game night we are bored out of our minds by the same games, so this would give us another variety.
