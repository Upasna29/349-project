"http://steamcommunity.com/id/deadonarrival09/recommended/264220/","deadonarrival09","DeadonArrival09","http://steamcommunity.com/id/deadonarrival09/","215 products in account","This game starts out alot like other games in the genre, learn to walk, jump and run to name a few. The levels become ever more devious as you progress but are never hard for the wrong reasons. One cool mechanic is the scenery/mood change after you die alot. And you will be dying alot. One tip, look carefully ahead of you for any traps that might not be easily apparent. The music is very good and sets the mood nicely for each set of levels. The scenery and backgrounds for each level are beautifully done and are pleasant on the eyes. The hero moves at a slow pace to begin with but before long you are running for your life from traps and ducking and dodging with the best of em. In each level a collectible can be found and in alot of cases, a new power is needed so collecting it must be done later. All in all the game offers value at and above the current price. It has its charm and challenges and will have you cursing every god you can name at times but as always, overcoming the challenges is its own reward. For what the game is and offers, it executes perfectly in every aspect and any platformer fan out there should rise to the challenge.","May 1, 2014","true","2.7"," 40 of 45 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","40","45","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Cantisque/recommended/264220/","Cantisque","Canti","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Cantisque/","2676 products in account","Brutal platformers are basically small levels with tricky jumps and an emphasis on speed. Mr. Bree+ delivers 60 levels of gameplay, but with a far more forgiving difficulty curve than many of its competitors.\n\nThe concept is simple, you play as the titular character, running and jumping through 60 progressively more difficult levels. As you waltz through the early stages, you will collect various abilities to aid you such as wall jumping, double jumping, ducking and sprinting. Each level also has a bonus collectible item to find which is usually in a tough to reach spot. Collecting enough of these unlocks the more difficult stages later.\n\nMr. Bree+ is best described as a mashup between Super Meat Boy and Toki Tori. There is less of a focus on speed and momentum, allowing you to take your time and work out the best way to deal with a particular problem. It also has frequent checkpoints so you don’t have to replay the level from the start if you should die. This makes completing the game considerably easier than Super Meat Boy, by borrowing the reduced difficulty, slower pace and level design from Toki Tori. The levels themselves usually involve avoiding spikes, either on the floor, walls or flying through the air. Levels also contain camouflaged traps such as pits or nets that fall from the ceiling, as well plenty of moving platforms.\n\nAside from the core stages, the game packs a plethora of achievements which involve collecting items, completing stages within a time limit and without dying, as well as a few pointless ones such as watching the end credits all the way through. In general, they do add an extra challenge if you found the main game too easy.\n\nThe game doesn’t control nearly as smoothly as games like the aforementioned Super Meat Boy, or others like They Bleed Pixels. This is likely down to the slower pace, but most certainly a lack of polish on the way Mr. Bree handles. For example, since double jump and wall jump are the same button, he often doesn’t quite know which one to do. Add to this occasional game freezes, Windows 8 compatibility issues and odd bugs like starting a level lodged inside a wall, or a gate not triggered open properly if you press the switch in a certain way, you have a disappointing number of annoying bugs to deal with as well, albeit rarely. These should be relatively easy to fix, but no word as of writing on an update.\n\nMr. Bree+ has a plot, but the developers really tried too hard and got a little too ambitious (Slavery? Really?). The sorts of emotions they try to convey simply do not hit home for several reasons. For starters, the game is just too simplistic for any sort of serious storyline to be taken seriously. Secondly, a lot of the text appears at the bottom of the screen during the game, most of it is missed because you’re too busy concentrating on actually staying alive, the text also disappears so fast that you wouldn’t be able to read it anyway. Even if you did get the chance to read it, you will find many grammar and spelling errors and just bad English in general.\n\nThe visuals are a mixed bag, with some elements shining while others drag the experience down to the point where it affects the gameplay itself. For starters, the character animation, for a budget title, is simply wonderful. The character sprites are fully animated, along with impressive stylised artwork in the cutscenes. Level design assets are less impressive, with most of them being static and having little variation or consideration for making something aesthetically pleasing to look at. Lastly, the biggest flaw with the graphics by far is that the framerate is locked to 30FPS, which is an absolute travesty for this genre of game.\n\nAudio also has its ups and downs. What few sound effects there are come through as mundane and generic, as well as having little variation despite being used repeatedly. On the other hand, the soundtrack is awesome, I mean REALLY awesome. The soundtrack alone is worth the asking price for this game, in my opinion. The soundtrack is not available through Steam, but can be found on Bandcamp for $1.\n\nIn summary, Mr. Bree+ is an inexpensive introduction to this particular platforming sub-genre. The budget price is justified by the various quality issues, but is fully competent at what it does and the effort that has been put into the presentation shines through in many aspects. A delicious pork chop, even if it does get stuck in your teeth on the way down.\n\n\nPros:\n~Cheap\n~Balanced and steady difficulty curve\n~Good visual presentation for a budget game\n~Great soundtrack\n~Plenty of content, good replayability value\n\nCons:\n~Several unnecessary and annoying bugs, glitches, freezes\n~Framerate locked to 30FPS\n~Disappointing boss fights\n~Embarrassingly bad plot","May 13, 2014","true","11.4"," 27 of 28 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","27","28","0","2"

This, coupled with an astonishing soundtrack, make this game a must for the genre-lovers considering its current price.\n\nThe only downside is the current lack of workshop content; it would be nice to see user-created levels in the near future to lengthen even more the game experience.\n\nNote that at the time of writing this review, I've roughly completed about 1/3 of the game. In no way does my playtime reflect the actual duration of this game. Considering the levels get more and more complicated (NOTE: The difficulty curve in this game is pretty good), I assume it will last between 2:30 and 3:30 hours.\n\nEDIT: I am about to finish this game, only about 10 levels left including a couple special levels, and still lots of achievements to earn. I'd say my estimation of a little more than 2:30h was kind of accurate. The difficulty in the final levels is still a bit challenging, though I find that I may struggle with a level but then complete the next one in just one go. However, the game is still as fresh as when I bought it, and I am enjoying every second of frustration and satisfaction of it.","May 2, 2014","true","2.5"," 25 of 27 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","25","27","0","0"

The game has received some very positive attention at different stages in its development.The game puts in control of the titular Mr. Bree as he makes his way home to his piggy family, dodging deadly traps and making odd little observations and witticisms to himself. It’s a bit of a mixed bag, but if you can forgive its minor faults you’ll be in for a good ride.The platformer action is pretty solid. Each level challenges you to reach a puzzle piece item to proceed, putting obstacles like pits, spikes, buzz saws, locked doors or falling boulders in your path. Mr. Bree starts out the game without any abilities, not even jumping or ducking, but learns these skills as the game progresses, slowly making you more capable as you proceed.The world doesn’t quite look like a Saturday morning cartoon but it has a pleasant, cheerful quality about it that’s nice to look at. Many of the graphics appear to be hand drawn and some of them have a particularly rough, sketchy quality that might not be equally charming to everyone, but overall the game has a nice, vibrant look with settings full of detail and animation.The game has a fantastic soundtrack that almost doesn’t fit the game. The first levels start out with a dark, somber piano tune that feels very ominous although maybe a little out of synch with the colorful forest background. Later levels pick up the lonely wail of an electric guitar. Depending on your tastes you might find it doesn’t match the rest of the game.Mr. Bree+ does bring a good chunk of game to the table with sixty levels and lots of production value. It’s fun and charming with it’s slightly off English translation, colorful scenery and shredding soundtrack, and I think that platformer fans and occasional players will find something to like about this title.","October 9, 2014","true","6.3"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","15","16","0","0"

I've actually beaten the original Flash incarnation of this game before, so this is less a review and more of a comparison/series of general thoughts.\n\nMr. Bree was, and still is, an enjoyable cartoon platformer. Through a series of 60 levels, you'll control the titular pig as he runs and jumps through a series of increasingly-difficult locations, ranging from simple forests to abattoirs and everything in-between.\n\nI never got the sense that this was as difficult as any of the Meat Boy games, as there seemed to be a lot of leeway in difficulty - I never felt it was impossible to complete a stage, and the levels feel like they were designed to reward people who practiced the wall-jumping/double-jumping and wanted to speedrun them.\n\nMuch like Meat Boy, though, the story is near-irrelevant fluff meant to tie certain worlds together. The whole pretext of the story is a pig waking up with amnesia after escaping from a slaver, and he has forgotten most of his basic skills. I felt that this concept (of having to learn your abilities) could have been taken a lot further. While there are opportunities to go back to earlier levels and get items with unlocked abilities, the levels themselves never really play up the fact that you're limited in mobility for a certain stretch of time. Contrast that to something like Don't Move, which rewards you based on trying and/or failing to increase your mobility or set of abilities. Once you unlock double-jumping, most of the levels become a breeze and there's no real threat to any of the obstacles.\n\nStill, I found it to be an enjoyable romp, and for the price point (usually around $3, but less during sales), you could do a whole lot worse.","June 28, 2014","true","26.4"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pepsimanvsjoe/recommended/264220/","pepsimanvsjoe","pepsimanvsjoe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pepsimanvsjoe/","1281 products in account","Mr. Bree is just another pig trying to make it in a 2D platformer world. Despite his inability to survive even the slightest contact with a sharp object, he continues again and again until he makes it home.\n\nHonestly, I don't care much for Super Meat Boy and the sub-genre it helped spawn. I don't fault the way those games are designed, it's just a personal preference. Short & brutally hard games just aren't my thing. I still managed to get most of the way through Mr. Bree+. I guess I should explain why.\n\nRelatively-speaking, this is a pretty easy game. The deaths are constant, but the checkpoints are frequent. The music is also really good. Porcine protags are few and far between, so this game gets points for that. At the moment the only other game I can think of is Muchi Muchi Pork. This is a 2D shooter about pig-girls who ride flying bicycles, while fighting evil*. Anyway, this is a game that's actually rather pleasant, despite Bree's aptitude for exploding. His constant internal monologuing makes him a bit pretentious as well, so half the time I feel like his deaths are deserving.\n\nThere are a decent amount of stages, the rare collectible, and the controls are suitable enough. There's even a hardcore difficulty and you're constantly challenged to beat your best times. However, Mr. Bree+ is held back from potential greatness due to a number of issues:\n\nPoor frame-rate - It goes without saying that a platformer should be 60 fps. Mr. Bree+ is 30? Less than 30? More than 30? Whatever, it's not good enough. This lack of frames translates to missed jumps, which results in shredded pork** Flying objects are also more difficult to dodge, which is the reason why I didn't beat the other boss. There are two of them, one at the end of the forest, the other at the end of the slaughterhouse.\n\nBIG hit-box - The difference between Mr. Bree and Mr. Breesket can sometimes be attributed to his large hit-box. It's kinda hilarious really, because even sharp objects that touch his cape will kill him. I figure that this game can be improved, if it accounted for bacon-saving close shaves.\n\nThe lousy boss-fights - The thing about bosses, is that any issues with the game tend to culminate at these exact moments. This evil warthog is beaten by dropping a box on his head a few times. Getting there is a pain. Before he each attack he has a little code-word, which clues you in on what he's going to do next. The thing is, you won't know the first time around, which leads to guaranteed deaths. This might have been alleviated if the hit-box and frame-rate were improved. The other (slaughterhouse) boss forces you to dodge flying spikes while wall-sliding. It was at this point I surrended.\n\nIn my opinion, both bosses could have been dumped in exchange for some new stages, or a better finale. Maybe Bree could attempt to escape giant meat-grinder/tank, or parachute from a butcher's flying fortress while dodging buzz-saws, I don't know. Fixing the frame-rate/hit-box issues is probably a lot simpler, and would leave me less of an excuse for being a quitter.\n\nMr. Bree+ isn't a bad game. Even for a guy like myself who thinks spikes should belong in pits and not walls, ceilings, or in the atmosphere. Aside from a frustrating finale it's a decent enough game to jump through. Give it a go, you might not regret it.\n\n*If you guessed that Muchi Muchi Pork is a Japanese game. Congrats!....You don't get a prize.\n\n**Mmm...shredded pork.","November 20, 2014","true","3.9"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","7","7","2","0"

Highly recommended for fans of platformers.\n\nThe story is decent though I felt that it lacked something. Can't quite put my finger on what exactly it lacked but it kept me interested long enough to actually complete it. At first I tried to play using just the keyboard but quickly switched to my gamepad.\nNOTE: I recommend using a gamepad as it makes some of the tighter places in the game much easier to reach.\nOne complaint I have is that you can't change the controls. I would rather have used the triggers for the run ability and whenever I pushed the thumbstick in, the game paused causing me to die after I resumed the game. A couple of places in the game I glitched out and had to restart the level which was a little annoying. Luckily the levels are not that big so not much progress was lost.\n\nThe game is fairly short but enjoyable. Can't say it has much replayability but I only paid $2.00 for it so I'm not complaining. I like the allusion to a sequel at the end. If you buy it and play it you'll see what I mean. I do hope there will be a sequel but this time around a little more focus on the overall story would be very nice. One annoying feature of the game, when you die a number of times the background changes color and throws shadows on the game which sometimes makes it harder to play. Sometimes it's raining, which doesn't make much difference to the way the character interacts with the world but is annoying. Key solution? DON'T DIE!\n\nSpoiler\nIf you do buy this game and play it, note that the Wild Boar boss at the end is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥! Just keep moving and don't let him or anything he throws touch you and You'll be okay!

It's immediately comparable to Super Meat Boy and to a much lesser extent, Braid. I say Braid simply b/c of the soundtrack which has a wistful and relaxing approach while you meet your death over and over again.\n\nGamewise its just a simple platformer with some puzzle elements as you go along. You go through levels avoiding various traps and you slowly gain new abilities. You cannot jump in the first few levels. You cannot crouch in the first fewer levels, but eventually you can do both along with other abilities that you gain as you progress.\n\nThis game is recommended for two sorts of players. If you are a platforming masochist (as I am) and enjoy torturing yourself while you master the levels, this game is up your alley. I also recommend the game for the very strong soundtrack which is where the comparison to Braid comes in. There's a lot of piano, violin, and live drums rather than a drum machine, which gives the music a more organic feel to it. Frankly, the music is what kept me going as I found myself raging more and more (one look at my achievements will tell you how easy it is to rack up the easy deaths) at this fun, but torturous, game. This also feels by design as a more erratic soundtrack would make it harder to want to go for "one more level".\n\nIt's already low priced and its been bundled a couple of times which should make it an easy purchase for an SMB or platforming fan. At the time of this review I've not even covered a fraction of the levels, and with timed runs through every level, replayability is very high. Level design is smart even in the early stages.\n\nIf I had to choose a negative trait, I'm not much of a fan of the screen tint changes as you die more and more in the same level. It makes it harder to see the smaller obstacles and while its pretty obvious this is by design, it annoyed me more than I liked it.\n\nGet it. Torture yourself. Enjoy the music and the very strong color this game exudes. And watch out for hidden traps and later on, the nets that will surely cause even more pork chops being served in Mr. Bree's lovely forest beginnings.\n\nController is highly recommended to enjoy this game to the fullest potential.","July 26, 2014","true","2.5"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","1"

This game looks to be inspired by hardcore and classic platformers (elements from Super Meat Boy and even things that remind me of Rayman). The game overall plays really smooth. Platforming mechanics are ok, but the wall jumping is trash in my opinion. The music/audio is excellent, great controller support, trading cards, and steam achievements.\n\nWith all that said, its not really THAT hard on the normal mode. There are checkpoints throughout each level, so if you fail you can still finish the level without completely restarting. To me, replaying a game for a second time on a harder difficulty that I havent unlocked isnt the way I like to experience "replayability".\n\nFor the price, you really cant beat it.

It actually tries to be somewhere between Super Meatboy and an unfair platformer. For me it is rather an unfair (albeit beatable) one because of bad controls and communication. The game forces controller users to use the analog stick for movenment controls where a directional pad would feel more appropriate. Traps are hard to see and often require sheer luck. New mechanics are introduced in a conterintuitive manner - the wall jump for example is aquired in in a tight space with no way to try out immediatly.\nMy "favourite" aspect of the game is a red tint that appears when you start to many times on a level.

If you in any way think this is going to affect you, AVOID AT ALL COSTS, it's miserable.\n\nBasically this game is Super Meat Boy except you're not kosher now*. Also, the controls are sloppier. You know how SMB really worked because the controls were tight at all times? Yeah, this game doesn't have that and it ups the frustration as a result. I wouldn't say it's ever as hard as the worst parts of SMB, but only because I played every stage in SMB and this has nothing near that game's heights. Overall I'd say it ramps up pretty fast. Really wish this had a demo because that would be the perfect way to judge if this would work for you/whether you'd like it, but I guess that's too much to ask from some folks.\n\nI really don't think it's a bad game? Just incompetent enough that it really makes me mark it down on the rough side of "not fun", even on the earlier stages where framerate is consistent it didn't feel that POLISHED. I can't tell if the frame lag is what's making jumps feel semi-random or not, either, a single tap of the button is sometimes a short hop, sometimes "WHOOPS YOU LEPT INTO A SAW".\n\n* I just kind of assumed Meat Boy was kosher because Salt Factory.

You start with nothing but the ability to move back and forth, but quickly learn how to jump. From there, you unlock other moves (a crouch, a wall jump, and a double jump) that will let you go back to earlier levels and collect items you couldn't get before to unlock bonus levels. The difficulty scales fairly well, and the controls are good enough that you have a decent handle on what you're doing most of the time (although wall jumping takes some getting used to).\n\nHOWEVER, this game has some major problems. The most important one is that this game must have some sort of memory leak or something, because the framerate is terrible and only gets worse as you keep playing. I could still manage to beat levels, but good lord is it ugly, and I can definitely see it throwing some people off. The game also does this thing where after every 5 deaths or so, the look of the level changes. The problem is that after the first 5 deaths on a stage, it changes to this very dark black and red theme, like this. It makes it much harder to see what's going on, as there are some platforms that are hard to distinguish even when the lighting is normal, and it also makes some traps like the trapping pits basically impossible to see. At that point, it's almost better to just kill yourself 5 more times just to change the lighting to something more tolerable.\n\nIt's kinda hard for me to give this game a thumbs down, because I did like the level layouts and the controls are pretty much fine. But man, it just does NOT run correctly, in addition to having levels be almost unplayable for a period of 5 lives and a few bugs that freeze the game. I would say wait until a patch, but it doesn't seem like the devs actually plan on doing that. If it ever goes on sale for less than a dollar, maybe you'll get some fun out of it?

You are a pig who has suffered total memory loss. The story is strange but also funny and enjoyable and it adds a lot more depth to the game than other Indie Platformers where you just grind through levels, not knowing why. The worlds are full of traps, so you may die a lot trying to figure out how to get through the level and collect all items. Personally I'd actually enjoy it more than Super Meat Boy if it worked on my PC.\nThe game was coded using Flash, so basicly it has no way to utalize the hardware of my PC which in turn makes it glitchy, constantly crashing, and after a few levels time seems to slow down so reaction times for me are still the same, but projectiles and traps engage so slowly that I can easily out manuver them and avoid them. At first I thought the slowing effect was part of the game because I was dying so much, but once I restarted the game, the effect was gone until I beat a few more levels and then it was back again.\nMaybe it has something to do with the fact that I am running a 5 year old computer with an i5 2.3 ghz processor and a ATI HD 5470 graphics card with 512 mbs of ram, but I doubt it. Other platformers play perfectly with exception to Fez which is understandable considering it's complexity.

You've been through something terrible that you don't quite remember and all you want to do is get home to see your family. Thus, you begin your platforming adventure through the forest.\n\nFirst, the good: The art style is very nice and the music is pretty good as well. Checkpoints are provided for most levels, so you can pass even the harder levels without too much difficulty. These can be turned off when you unlock hardcore mode. There are collectibles to find that unlock extra levels and the rest of the story. The level design is nice for the most part.\n\nThe bad: The game is riddled with bugs. The game crashes and freezes randomly, has poor controller support, and environments that blend together and make it hard to distinguish foreground and background. Wall jumping feels janky and the controls in general do not feel tight enough to be in a 'hardcore-style' platformer. There's also a mechanic where the time of day changes each time you die in a level. Some of the lighting schemes for certain times of day render traps and pitfalls nearly invisible, making levels that you are already having trouble with even harder simply because you can't see anything.\n\nFor $2.99, I didn't expect a lot from the game. It feels like there is a decent platformer hiding somewhere beneath the bugs and issues and I think I could recommend it if some things got fixed. As it is, I'd rather just play Super Meat Boy.","May 3, 2014","false","6.9"," 6 of 17 people (35%) found this review helpful","35","6","17","0","0"

You are a pig...walking on 2 legs for whatever reason and everything around you is going to gut you. There are spikes, arrows, traps etc. Every level introduces new elements. There is also 1 puzzle piece per level which you can collect to unlock a sort of prologue.\n\nThe character will frequently share his thoughts with you if you enable it in the options although you will often miss it, because the game is quite demanding. It calls itself "hardcore" I think, but it's not Super Meatboy level insane. It plays a lot slower and more determined, although some passages seem to be only manageable by pure luck (arrows so fast you can barely see them) and those are extremely annoying. Luckily though the game handles pretty decently. Your character moves when you tell him to and stops when you tell him to, even in mid air, which took some getting used to. He just stops dead when you release the button.\n\nYou can also get 5 special powers. The first of which is how to jump (lol that was kinda funny). The game gets increasingly more complex (1st of 3 official "chapters"). It also looks kinda neat and is challenging, but mostly fair, as you get a multitude of check points during each level. The only real gripe I got with it is the setting. You're in a forest and that's it apparently (with exception of the slaughterhouse prologue you can gradually unlock). Also when you die the screen often changes colour (I think this is to simulate daylight and night time?).\n\nHands down the best thing about this is the beautiful and soothing sound track though.

It was difficult enough that I struggled against many of the later levels and the bosses. But it wasn't so hard that I wanted to stop playing or bang my head on a wall. It could probably be compared to Super Meat Boy, but I don't feel like it is quite that difficult or punishing. There are no heat-seeking missles. It does have checkpoints pretty frequently, which I like, but some hardcore platformers might think that makes the game too easy. Though there is a hardcore mode after beating the game that removes the checkpoints.\n\nAnyway, it is a quality game for a good price. Sometimes I did have to use my mouse on the menu screen even though I used my controller during the levels.

It is generally easy to pick up, but it gets progressively harder as you go on with a ton of traps ready to kill you at any time.\n\nMr Bree balances the hardcore nature of the gameplay with very generous checkpoints. This is nice for players who might be a little intimidated by a harder platform game as you can easily make progress even after dying a lot.\n\nI highly recommend this game as it was quite fun. With the game time above I was able to complete the game and also spend a lot of time in hardcore mode, which is truly brutal towards the end. There are tons of achievements and you can also collect items inside the levels to unlock more levels. For the money it was well worth it, as it's a great game with a reasonable amount of content.\n\nOne small gripe I do have about the game is the changing color scheme within the levels. The color scheme of a level will change after you die about 5 times, and this will repeat in going through certain colors or weather effects. This would be a cool effect if it didn't dramatically change how the screen looks. The red color was quite annoying as it was very difficult to see. Of course I could just suicide my character until the color scheme changed, but I feel it is something the developers should look into and consider changing.\n\nThe 2 boss fights in the game are ok, but don't feel too fun because of their boring mechanics that are reused between both of them. I feel more time and creativity could go into them to make them more interesting, or just remove them in favor of hard platforming.\n\nThese are my only complaints, and this game was still pretty great and I'm glad I purchased it.
