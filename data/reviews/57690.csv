"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LeonDeclis/recommended/57690/","LeonDeclis","Leon Declis","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LeonDeclis/","240 products in account","At first, I wanted to be a kind, benevolent dictator, in charge of my island which of course would be perfectly green, a land of equality, equal pay, a high living standard, jobs for every Tropican, a high level of schooling and a good member of the United Nations.\n\nHowever, people kept complaining. At first, this was fine. Free Speech and all. But they were not working. Worse, they began to become rebels and attack the work of innocent, hard working Tropicans. "Right," I thought, "no more of that." I built guard posts around the nation to protect my other civilians and the economy which kept everyone fed and housed. After a while, the strikes became too much. "This right to protest is too inefficient", I thought, "and we just missed that freighter. We needed that boost to the economy." In a moment of Thatcher, I had the newly raised guards gun down some of the strikers. The rest returned to work. The right to protest had been removed, but people were happier as everyone got richer.\n\nThe environmentalists began to get angry. "It's too messy, too much industry, etc." I sighed. Look, did they like having money? Money to get houses? Electricity for movie theatres and hospitals? Wind Turbines simply don't do enough, we needed that gas Power Plant. We needed the jobs to keep the whole economy turning. I tried, I added gardens, I protected and grew new forests, but they continued to complain. So I stopped listening, and focused on the higher standard of living.\n\nThe U.S. came to me, demanding that I give them money, give this, give that, or "accidents can happen". But Agent Sasha instead never threatened me, referred to me as comrade and my islanders as Brothers. The Russians understood why I had to silence dissedence, and so we joined the Russians. At least they appreciated their people. The Americans... they didn't like this. But we stopped caring. We built assault rifles and using the funds from that, we built a nuclear weapon. Does it work? No idea, but it looks scary and shows the Americans that we MAY be able to blow something up. They stayed away and all was relatively well.\n\nNow, schooling was fine, but a lot of Tropicans were starting to get funny ideas. They didn't understand that I was so strict because I was balancing the house of cards that was my economy. They had food, jobs, entertainment, a good house with fantastic conditions, they were safe from criminals and rebels and they could travel anywhere in the world (but mostly Russia, China and the MIddle East). If they had to not protest or speak against me, it was purely because I couldn't risk this going wrong. So I had to change a few things. I began to ask that schools make sure that children understood how fantastic our nation was, how corrupt the U.S. was, how our military kept us safe. A few people got a bit funny with that, but I needed to make sure this nation would continue after my death. I executed the rebels and burnt any book which said otherwise. People got iffy, but after a few years, they stopped caring. Good. Now we can continue in happiness.\n\nFinally, my economy began to crumble. People refused to work the poorer jobs, they sat back on welfare and complained. They refused to pay the rent for better houses and built hovels on the side of roads. They committed crimes despite having social welfare. I couldn't make them work.\n\nSo, I built cheaper places for them to live, cheaper foods and easier work. But my towns were full, so I built them in another area. To support my now burdened economy, I had to import immigrants. Lots of them. A few people began to complain, but I shot them and they stopped. Now we have a high, middle, lower and underclass, which is executed often to save the economy.\n\nHowever, Tropico is now making more money than ever, we're supporting every country that needs us, our people are famous for their money (when they can afford to travel), people order is perfect, there is no crime, you can go as far as you're willing to work, and you're safe.\n\nYou're welcome, my comrades.","November 10, 2014","true","30.0"," 844 of 861 people (98%) found this review helpful 320 people found this review funny","98","844","861","320","24"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Happymartin/recommended/57690/","Happymartin","Happymartin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Happymartin/","308 products in account","Remember Sim City? The game where you take an empty landscape, and slowly but surely transform the area, from a small town, to a gigantic Metropolis?\n\nPicture all of that but instead of a landscape, it's a Carribean Island. Instead of turning a small town into a Metropolis, you're turning a third world Banana Republic, into a competent, capable nation, able to compete with the bigger world powers during the Cold War.\n\nThis is what Tropico is.\n\n\nTropico 4 is the fourth installment, in a line of City Management/Political Play/Strategy games, that has existed since the very early 2000s. Aside from certain notable additions, the major gameplay, and most of the models and graphics, are recycled from Tropico 3. Which, while I kinda wish they did a revamp of models, I understand the sentament. The gameplay isn't broken, and the models are just visual representations of what they are.\n\nThere are many additions to this game, some really add something to the game, others are pretty cool and add a bit, and some are just kinda meh.\n\nOne of the major gameplay mechanics is Political juggling between Seven Factions (Capitalists, Communists, Religious, Evironmentalists, Militarists, Nationalists, and Loyalists) as well as the Unites States, and The Soviet Union. The seven factions are still around, but now there are three more foreign powers, Europe, China, and The Middle East. Unlike the Soviets and Americans, who will invade you if you're relations with one or the other get's too low, these three won't invade you, as much as remove bonuses you recieve during good relations. Somtimes during your reign on the island, you'll get noticed that something bad happened between one of the nations, and you'll have to pick a side. There are also representatives for the factions. They mostly add two things. First, a face and personality to represent the faction they represent. Second, to provide side objectives during your reign to earn respect if you've lost some. The side objectives go for the Nations too, mostly in the form of sending goods that nation likes, or donating some money to that nation to earn respect.\n\nThere three more additions worth talking about, firstly, there is a story driven campaign, a first for the Tropico series. You are Presidente, being mentored by a Generalisimo Santana, in the ways of managing a nation, and growing it Economically, treating your citizens right, knowing when to "kick the dog", and overall just staying in power and not getting killed or kicked out of office.\n\nThe second is Imports. Generally speaking, if your island is a giant rock and little vegitation for food, then you're screwed and have to make the most of it. Otherwise, you can import! Say your on an island with a free Weapons Factory to build! But oh no, there is no Iron on the island at all! No worries, just have a stable economy, and import the iron from one of the foreign powers. It'll arrive on the next ship, be proccesed in the factory, and you'll earn alot of money!\n\nFinally, there are the Disasters. In Tropico 3 you mostly had five "negative" events that could occur. A rebel attack, a coup from your own military, a hurricane, an uprising, and a faction disaster if a faction really hates you. Now there are Natural disasters to spice things up. Now you have to worry about events you can predict (via a Weather Station), but cannot control. Things like Volcanic Eruptions (if your island has a volcano), A Tornado (or several if you're really unlucky), a Tsunami, Oil Spill, fires, and droughts. Fires from volcanos and derelict buildings can be fixed by either paying for a helicopter to put it out, or by building a firestation. I personally like these disasters, because in Tropico 3 I was such a good presidente that I never had to worry about a coup or anything like that. Now, there is something I can worry about when my island is happy.\n\nSo far I really like that the game is still easy to play in general (once you know what to do that is), and the additions are very nice. But I have some cons.\n\nSomtimes you'll get a notice about doing something and have to choose an option. You can't exit out to check your almanac to see what it could impact and how to fix it, you have to choose, and that sucks sometimes. Also some missions in the campaign are pretty tough on you. You have to make sure you've picked the right traits for President to make the island truley yours.\n\nI don't do reviews, so I won't use a number system, and instead list the pros and cons, and then a final statement as to wether you should really grab this or not.\n\nPROS:\n\n-Game Mechanics are the same, with additions like imports.\n-Disasters add suspense and more risk to buildings wrecked.\n-Story is fun and simple\n-Characters have well drawn charicature type portraits to represent them\n-Some new buildings to help out with the new additions\n\nCons:\n\n-AI for the Tropicans are competent, but man do they job hop around, and they'll walk through Morder itself just to get some corn.\n-Sometimes a choice won't let you check statistics to really understand an impact.\n-Some missions in the campaign aren't easy.\n\nShould you buy this game? If you like Sim City, you'll love Tropico 4, if you like Sim City, but want it on a smaller scale, you'll love Tropico 4, if you want to try a "modern" Sim City game, but EA screwed it up, then You'll like Tropico 4.\n\nBut if you don't like statistics, or the recycled models and gameplay, as well as the AI, I wouldn't reccommend it.\n\nIt's $29.99 on Steam, but I'd also reccomend you grab Tropico 3 for it's cheaper price, and they're the same gameplay wise.","February 19, 2014","true","43.9"," 490 of 506 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","490","506","0","13"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/taerdin/recommended/57690/","taerdin","Taerdin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/taerdin/","1226 products in account","Tropico 4 is a pretty standard city management sim, except it takes place on the islands of Tropico where you are free to be as dictatorial as you want. You may commit election fraud, kill protestors, create a secret police, and embezzle money into your swiss bank account. All that said, I was struck by how incredibly similar this game is to the previous one.\n\nIf you own and have played Tropico 3 and you feel like you got about all you could out of that game, there is nothing for you here. If you are new to the series, this is as good a place as any to jump in. Unfortunately this game requires you to register for yet another 3rd party service you will probably rarely ever use unless you are a big Kalypso fan.\n\nAnother aspect to mention is that the game is not very clear on how some of the buildings and functionalities work. For instance when you place certain buildings you can see the landscape is shaded. When placing a farm, the greener areas are areas where your crops will have an easier time growing, when placing a police station it shows you areas of high crime in red, etc. But for some buildings it is not clear what the colours are really indicating. For instance, should you try to place a garbage dump close to red areas, which are presumably pollution? I wouldn't think so, because they just concentrate into one spot... so why even show it? Instinctively I would place my garbage dumps away from city areas, and I'm unsure what the indication really does to help. Maybe that isn't the best example but there are others.\n\nAlso construction slows down immensely once your town grows into even moderate size. I keep building more and more construction yards but it doesn't seem to help, and some buildings will simply never be built unless they are prioritised.\n\nThankfully the game is incredibly forgiving so all the issues can largely be overlooked. If you ever are in need of funds foreign powers will simply give you aid, and you'll find in most cases this makes it impossible to 'lose' by running out of money (if it even is possible...).\n\nOverall it's worth a play if you're new to the series, but there isn't a big improvement over the last iteration.","November 30, 2013","true","12.9"," 186 of 200 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","186","200","0","4"

It is pleasant to look at and you can almost build your city the way you like. Being on tropical island is refreshing.\n\nYou are basically a standard Latino dictator (parody of Castro) who has to build up his Island into a prosperous city amidst the Cold war. You can choose to make your government more communist oriented or capitalist. In doing so you get the support from one of the Super powers. Similarly, you get various benefits or disadvantages in your international relations depending on how you run your island.\n\nFarming, industry, tourism, education, transport are some of the many aspects of the economy you'll have to manage in order to keep your islanders fed and happy.\n\nThis is only a single player game though. The only thing you can do is upload your city in sort of high scores fashion where other folks can check it out. But for some reason I had trouble doing so.\n\nIf you can get it cheap (on sale) then you can easily enjoy it for couple of days at least. Even if you get Tropico 5 when it comes out, some of the content will stay unique as in Tropico 3 like the radio broadcaster/ commentator and music etc.","April 19, 2014","true","131.6"," 118 of 124 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","118","124","0","1"

With extra missions and Modern times. I think the nicest thing about this game is the fact that everything has a solution. Unlike its predecessor Tropico 3 where you were stuck with high pollution from factories you now have garbage dumps and water treatment plants in Modern times. You have alternative energy sources. You can import goods and smuggle goods. Your island no longer defines what you can do on it but rather your imagination limits the way you play.

You can build many things, do many things... in fact many things can happen here. Greatest simulation game I ever play.\n\nGameplay of Tropico 4 is very rich, and they're so great! Start as a small town in an island on the Caribbean, we begin developing by building new living places such as houses, creating infrastructure and public services such as roads, church, hospital and ♥♥♥♥. Everything needs to be addressed here, the happiness of the people, the economy and industry, even diplomacy with other nation and the two world great superpowers, The USA and the USSR.

Volcano could erupt and explodes, tornadoes may attack or even tsunami can invade! But hey! You are the El Presidente right? Anything is possible.\n\nTropico 4 Graphics are quite decent, while it's not as pretty as SimCity, it's not bad. Still has its own beauty.

Tropico 4 is the perfect game for the "would-be-generalissimo", where you can always try [and make some mistakes, while] to command your own "banana republic". Have you ever wondered "what if" all people got the same [low] wages, all to expend at that decrepit pub on the corner? So this is your game.\n\nIn a comparison to Tropico 3, it's the same experience after all. Some areas were improved, it's more stable on newer computers, and we have some slight changes to game mechanics. The expansion "Modern Times" add a high-tech [for Tropican Standards] taste and more funny jokes to the main game. It's a must buy if you liked the original.\n\nDespites the derivative sense that a player of Tropico 3 can get about Tropico 4, new challenges, choices and jokes [they are plenty and really funny if you catch the real-world references] await the veteran. For a city-buliding game, it really delivers the experience of commanding the life of each inhabitant. It's a different and welcome approach in front of games with a broad scope like SimCity and CitiesXL.\n\nThe economic sphere is simple and it's possible to make a nice profit if one follow an economic chain, from tobacco crops to cigar factories, for example. In the welfare case, Tropicans are eager than most to accept dubious services, and have an inexplicable urge to visit churches and cathedrals [don't miss the joke on the Cathedral!]\n\nIf you want a middle-range priced game that will deliver some dozens of hours at a tropical utopic/dystopic paradise, this is, I wonder, the sole competitor in genre. Players of Tropico 3 will get less of it, but it is worth the price. Newcomers will easily find themselves immersed on this atmosphere.

After playing Tropico, I don't think I could go back to playing Simcity ever again.\n\nTropico is more or less what Simcity would be if it had a nonsensical, but fantastically humorous storyline. You play as El Presidente, ruler of some island, and the game takes you through a bunch of different and ridiculous scenarios. Describing them would spoil the fun of you finding them out on their own. In the meantime, you have to keep everyone happy - be it the religious group, the nationalists or the environmentalists, which often requires a delicate balance in where you spend your hard-earned dollars.\n\nAs for the gameplay, the learning curve is just about where you want it to be. You have a lot of leeway in the earlier missions and the objectives are relatively straightforward, whilst the later objectives can be a little frustrating and even unfair. There was one mission in particular where after playing for hours and completing the initial objectives, I was told that the next objective had to be completed by a certain date - this date had already passed, and I instantly failed the objective. I was... miserable, to say the least.\n\nUnfortunately (or fortunately, depending on who you are), once you get the hang of the game and know what you're doing, things become a little bit too easy. Without trying to spoil anything, I'll just say that some forms of income are much easier to obtain than other forms, which creates somewhat of a conundrum - you WANT to diversify your city because it's more fun that way, but it requires more work for it to be successful.\n\nThe graphics are pretty standard for a modern game, although the Caribbean-inspired music was stuck in my head for quite some time.\n\nOverall, I'd most definitely recommend this game for anyone that likes city-building simulation games (be it Sim City, Rollercoaster Tycoon, Theme Park, etc).\n\n","July 7, 2014","true","134.2"," 25 of 25 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","25","25","0","0"

This makes it a good game, but disappointing. I would not recommend this unless Tropico 3: Ultimate Power somehow cost more money than this, which I'd have a hard time believing is going to happen.\n\nThis strikes me as a creatively bankrupt sequel, most noticable in how they have adjusted the shaders and bloom to make all the content look different, but 99% of it is the same content as in Tropico 3 Ultimate Power and it now just looks uglier.\n\nSpeaking of DLC, there is a lot of it for this time, but none of it seems to offer any improvement to the game. The game as it was in Tropico 3 was already fairly complete in terms of options for its setting, and I would attribute the choice of what DLC to create more on marketing decisions and not creative, design decisions that would actually make the game any better. I have a hard time figuring out why else there is no worthwhile DLC.\n\nOne irritating new feature are the advisors. They don't appear to actually have any effect on the running of your empire, their only function is that they unlock the usage of policies. Tropico 3 did not have this requirement, and there aren't any new, valuable policies that would necessitate an increase in start-up cost. All in all this 'feature' is a downside-- it's one more hoop that you must jump through on every single session. If your choice of advisors meant something, this would be one more wrinkle to make every island unique, but as implemented it just makes each island take longer.\n\nVoicework has been redone entirely for this edition of the game, but the lines are all the same. The difference is now the accents and mannerisms are much more muted, much more subtle. Improvement? I guess if you took the voicework in Tropico 3 very seriously and felt it was insensitively broad, then this would be an improvement. Personally I really missed the energetic, light-hearted and boisterous character-line delivery, and the words haven't even changed so if they wanted to be more politically correct this is a half-measure at best; a compromise that pleases no one.\n\nIf you've tapped out Tropico 3 and its expansions and just want more missions, then by all means, get this game. If you're wondering which Tropico to get, or want the most value for the dollar, get Tropico 3 + its expansion.","November 16, 2012","false","29.4"," 100 of 153 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","100","153","0","2"

Islands have specific resources to exploit or ignore, and the infrastructure required for some industries means it's easier to focus entirely on one or two industries than it is to spread your resources around.  Tourism islands rely upon good press and expensive attractions bleeding visitor wallets dry, while farming or mining and industry can make for a relatively more stable economy (if one subject to the whims of international prices) but also require far more effort put into educating and housing the populace.\n\nAlso unlike SimCity, unhappiness is a much greater direct threat to your Presidential persona.  Especially early on, you'll be short on food, housing, healthcare, churches, and schools, and extremely short on resources to fulfil those needs.  In the interim, you've got a rebellion fomenting if you don't jury-rig a working city on the double.  Inversely, like with many of these types of games (like the older Pharaoh or Caeser games) once your miniature city starts working at all, you're in the clear, and there are rarely any real threats.  (Although now natural disasters can strike, as well as things like superpower conflicts, which make for late-game threats that Tropico 3 didn't have.)\n\nYou can play any level past completion of the objective, so you can just keep going until you have an island completely packed to the brim with bustling economic activity, and have money coming out the ears, if you so choose.\n\nTropico 3 is an important comparison to make because... there aren't really that many changes from Tropico 3.  Tropico 3 is cheaper, has the *EXACT SAME ENGINE, GRAPHICS, AND VOICES* and most of the mechanics are unchanged.  You might consider getting 3 first.  The differences are in disasters and mini-quests that pop up mid-mission, which DO keep the game feeling a little fresh, but if you're not certain on the series, but Tropico 3 on sale to test-drive the series.\n\nTropico 5 is out now, but unless you know you want it, it's probably worth waiting for all the changes that will likely be made to the base game to be made, and play 4 instead until 6 comes out, and 5 is finalized.","November 11, 2014","true","52.4"," 27 of 31 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","27","31","0","0"

The game has a lot of charm and humor, which you can see all over the place. Gameplay is not made for large scale sandbox playing, instead it's heavily oriented towards the campaign missions, but don't worry, here, it has you covered. The "Modern Times" expansion brings a lot to the table, like new buildings and a new campaign. The campaigns follow a story and you get to do all sorts of crazy stuff including getting (Twitter?) followers and managing a hiccup outbreak. Every person on the island is tracked individually, you can click on them and see all sorts of data and their thoughts. Here you can also issue arrest warrants, bribes, brand them as heretics, eliminate or arrange "accidents".\n\nUnfortunately not everything is happy and sunny, there is a lack of micro-management that I believe is necessary. For instance I had a pretty big problem when instead of exporting what I considered excess food, my subjects decided to first hoard a lot of the food at the market instead of a more balanced approach. "Modern Times" times comes with a lot of newer versions for a lot of buildings, unfortunately you're stuck with a pretty inefficient system for the transport of goods, which becomes a bigger and bigger bottleneck as your city develops.\n\nPros: charm and humor.\nCons: doesn't scale well for larger cities, lack of some management options.\nRating: Have no fear, El Presidente is here!\nhttp://pixelloot.com","September 26, 2015","true","37.8"," 24 of 26 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","24","26","2","0"

No, not Roller Coaster Tycoon *Flash back to all the guests I drowned in my childhood* Tropico 4, is a simulation game, much like Rollercoaster Tycoon, where you attempt to accomplish various goals and earn money to get a higher score.\n\n-Detailed breakdown review-\nStory:  You are "Presidenti", a fictional character who can be pretty much whoever you want him to be. Personally I can't shake the name "fidel castro" From my mind. Anyway, I digress; You're whole goal is to shape the Island of "Tropico" into a paradise/world-power/luxury-resort/tourist-attraction.\nThere are a number of missions or quests that you complete as you progress through the game, you start out with a tutorial where you're being taught about "rule and politics" by "generalissimo". (aka, the tutorial)\n\nGame Play: There's several different modes, but generally it comes down to two ways to play: Missions, and Sandbox mode. On missions you have various objectives that you must succeed in to unlock the next mission.\nThe controls in the game feel like Rollercoster tycoon had woohoo with the Sims3, I've always disliked moving around the world with the cursor or the arrow keys, because whenever I press ASDW I bring up some rogue menu. However it's not too difficult to overcome the movement keys and zooming methods (mouse wheel).\nFair warning: There's a lot to take in when you start this game. Most people who have played Simulator games should already be aware of this quality, you micromanage a whole Island and have different objects that show up that you can choose to complete or not.\n\nAchievements: My achievements wouldn't appear until I leave the game and re-enter, most the achievements require really getting into the game and accomplishing various tasks, you would do well to just play through the campaign and worry about what achievements are left once you're finished.\n\nPrice: Tropico is priced at $19.99, which is a fair price for how much content is in the game, as always; I suggest waiting for a sale so you can get the most out of your money.\n\nConclusion: One last thing to keep in mind about Tropico 4, it was released in 2011. Meaning the graphics look dated, since the graphics tried to go for "realism" it's quite obvious the game was designed in 2011.\nHere's the real question: Do I like the game? Yes, and no. The game is fun, but I need to spend more time learning the mechanics. It's a sound working game, so there's that. But I didn't particularly enjoy this game more then other strategy games I've played.\nIn the end I don't feel one way or another about this game, there is a PC Demo, if you're considering getting this game I recommend trying that Demo to know for sure if you want it.\n\n------Edits and updates------\nEdit/Update February 25, 2015: Formatting correction.","February 24, 2015","true","13.3"," 20 of 24 people (83%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","83","20","24","7","0"

I would recommend it, but I feel the company is doing their absolute best to milk money out of their customer base by releasing small DLC at reasonably high prices for what you are receiving.  It's a shame, but then again so many people think capitalism is the greatest thing since the shaved clam.  Keep In mind capitalism is great for a new and burgeoning country in which the people need to have an opportunity to thrive and start up their own business.  The problem people fail to realize is government red tape wasn't the brain child of the U.S. Government, but the genius idea of well-established companies who being loyal and devoted to their shareholders were able to purchase up competition and create red tape through political pressure through lobbyists.  It was by design the rich are the smallest group among all societies, but it is a shame that a person can't work 40 to 50 hours a work week and support his wife and two kids.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/recommended/57690/","Foxysen","Foxysen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/","1172 products in account","Tropico 4 is yet another sequel to Tropico, still being about dictatorship, and a direct sequel of Tropico 3, being almost like expansion pack. Yep, it's like a building sim, but more centered around small populations of Banana republic, so to say. It was released in 2011 by Haemimont and Kalypso, being on PC and Xbox 360. Steam apparently got this version where they added one more sandbox map and some player costumes. In other words, this is probably the best version.\n\nNot much to say technical wide, but the engine was updated and seems to be even more optimized now. I didn't expect it to work better than Tropico 3, so that's great!\nAlbeit they implented Steam achievements in silly way. It only checks when you startup the game. That means that if you want in-game achievements to be noticed by Steam then you have to restart the game after your session of play.\n\nAnd well, what can I say. Tropico 4 without any add-ons feels like a mere expansion pack to Tropico 3: Absolute Power. Sure thing, it came out 2 years after the third one. I am not even sure what to write about.\n\nWell, there is now a new campaign which seem to be fun and with humorous characters. Now with proper main story lines. Still given only through text with potraits.\nIt was still a bit of a drag, so with it being so similar to Tropico 3 I didn't feel like beating it.\n\nThere are a few new buildings, like firehouse. Or salt mine, which promises infinite recources.\n\nIt still is easy to keep yourself in power and to have money rain on you from indursty. Actually, you can now import recources, making it possible to run pure industry busyness. And if you are tired of waiting for construction workers wasting time with fiesta, then you can now Quick Build construction with money. Which is great, but seeing how money rains on you, it kinda removes a bit more challenge.\n\nDisaster are now better implented. You can now actually watch hurricane wrecking up your plans in real time.\n\nIt's nice to be given side-quests by both campaign and by factions.\n\nAnd now I think I already ran out of any big things to mention.\n\nAs for those who never played, this game is about building your island nation, by placing buildings, issuing kinda-dictatorship edicts and keeping all political factions happy. Also, unlike first game, it's very easy to keep in power and keep factions happy, so 3 and 4 are very laid back games. Actually, it's easier to be democratic and honest, then try to be dictator, so forget about this part. Sadly. Still will steal hours of your time.\n\nIt's still is a bit more than Tropico 3 with Absolute Power, so newcomers should buy this one. Just watch it, there is one expansion pack and dozens of lazy tiny DLCes.","November 19, 2015","true","36.0"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","0"

Not much has changed since Tropico 3. There are new menus, new caricatures, new voice overs that lay on thick personality and accents. The graphics look the same and feel as if they're directly from Tropico 3. The are new disasters like tornadoes, tsunamis, droughts, and volcanoes. To compliment the disasters there are fire stations to put out the fires and a new weather station. To unlock edicts that help or opress your people, you'll not only need a ministry new to the series, but hire people to run each branch. You'll get to chose from viable candidates, or for a price you can import an expert. Buildings can now import resources. If you have a rum factory, but no sugar farms, you can simply import the sugar. There are also more foreign powers such as China, the UK and the Middle East. They won't donate money like the USA and USSR, but they'll give you goals to accomplish. There are new optional goals that you get by clicking the icons over buildings. New to the series is a quick build that will instantly construct a building for a price.\n\nTropico 4 is a surprisingly good city builder or rather a 3rd world simulator. It is very different than games like Sim City and Cities XL. Those two games are more macro city builders, where in two or three mouse clicks you can make city blocks where 1,000 people might live. With Tropico 4 and the Tropico series in general, you need to place each building, each road and your island along with the time it takes your construction company to build it. Your entire island might get to be 200 - 500 'Tropicans.'\n\nEach Tropican has needs... Food, religion, job, healthcare, entertainment, safety and so on. The catch is every Tropican's needs have a certain weight to them based on what faction they believe in. Each faction has major and minor demands. The military will want more soldiers, so you need to build an army base. The religious faction will want a church or cathedral. The capitalist party will want privatization or upscale entertainment. The communist party will want you to enable the free public housing edict or have etiquette healthcare.\n\nOn top of that, you balance political relations with the USA and USSR. If they get too bad, one of the two will basically take over your country and it will be game over. It is interesting how many ways that you can get game over. The most common way to get a game over is to lose an election. You don't have to have elections even. You're in charge. If you don't want an election, the nationalist party will hate you and your loyalist party will love you. If you opt to have elections, it will be vise versca. People will call for early elections and when you have elections, you can see preliminary results and you can even sway (cheat) elections. Its all at the risk of a party's love.\n\nIt is pretty cool having to pick 3 things to make a speech about and then fulfill campaign promises, but its all pretty easy. Winning elections is pretty easy, especially compared to how difficult it was to win any elections in the original Tropico. It was so bad in that game, that it was almost impossible to win an election without stuffing the ballot box.\n\nWhen citizens hate you, and there will be plenty that do, they will either peacefully protest or become rebels. Once you have enough rebels against you, they will attack your most remote buildings. Your army will then go fight them, but if the rebels outnumber your army, the rebel will win and the buildings will be destroyed. The rebels can attack your palace or flat out assassinate you for a game over.\n\nTropico has a single player campaign with 20 scenarios that each take an hour or two to complete. You don't just pick scenarios, you unlock them. Each scenario seems to have scenario specific events that only occur in the scenarios. Unlike Tropico 3, I don't get a sense in the scenarios of an ultimate goal I'm striving toward. I feel like I stumble into victory when its least expected. At the start of each scenario you can pick a player character from historical tropican dictators or make your own avatar. You can even make personality traits that will result in pros and cons. It can drastically change your play style if you are incorruptible and never have any crime or have a green thumb and have high farm yields at the cost of low factory production.\n\nYour businesses, mines, farms, and everything requires citizens in them to function and make you money. Every citizen has different education levels that will impact who does what. So you need to build high schools and colleges. Once built, there are options to gear students to military or religion. You can also click vacant positions to hire foreign experts for a price. If you have more businesses than citizens, build an immigration office and let anyone into the country or change it to only let in skilled workers so you keep bums out of your country.\n\nNothing is done automatically. You place a building, then wait for your teamsters and construction crews to build it. The more crews and personnel you have working, the faster it'll get done. I'm happy with that. Its part of the realism. If there's a building you want developed faster, you can increase or decrease its priority. If its still taking too long, just have your avatar stand next to the building to get it done faster. The fire station works the same way.\n\nThe graphics are beautiful and you'll see every Tropican walking around, hopping in their car and driving to locations. The music is nice and very Tropican / Salsa music, but there's very little variety from Tropico 3. A few hours in I was bored with the music. The DJs feel gone for the most part. They're still in the game, but they do interviews with one liners here and there. The voice acting consists of great parodies of stereotypes. They really had fun embellishing on characters with tongue in cheek humor. The game knows you're all powerful and while being a dictator is usually seen as a horrifyingly negative thing, the humor twists it into a silly positive thing.\n\nIf you have Tropico 3, play Tropico 3. Tropico 4 is still a great game, but has a ton of DLC and feels like a cash grab with only minor upgrades. The menu feels more cumbersome and click heavy than Tropico 3. The disasters take way too long and it breaks the flow the game has. The quick build feature feels like a good addition that you don't have to use, but sometimes it takes forever for the construction crews to build, even with several construction offices at full capacity.","December 9, 2014","false","55.5"," 49 of 81 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","49","81","0","12"

Unfortunately, I have yet to log over 100 hours on this game so any further points would be best commented on by more experienced players.\n\nMy only complaint after completing the game 100% is that some of the objective descriptions are pretty vague. I encountered 2 such missions which I had trouble fully understanding mainly due to the lack of objectivity in the text. If you google 'canned goods index tropico 4' then you'll be able to see what I mean.\n\nAnyway, aside from that small thorn on my side, I genuinly had fun with the game.

Filled with incremental improvements that make it easier and more engaging than ever to fill the role of dictator of a Caribbean island, Tropico 4 never quite takes the steps to fully distinguish itself from the third entry in the series.\n\nFor those new to the series, Tropico is a city-builder, where the player needs to balance the needs of citizens in a third world island nation with economic growth through industry and tourism, as well as building up your military for the time when the public gets restless and revolution starts to spread across your island. Along the way, you have to pander to local political factions, try to please the USSR and US to stave off invasions and secure aid, and, in a new addition to Tropico 4, try to work with lesser powers as well, dealing with the EU, China and the Middle East.\n\nThis complicated balancing act is aided by a new addition to the game's information screen, which shows what each faction and nation expects of you, and what you're doing to displease them, removing the guessing game of previous installments of Tropico and giving you access to a quick and easy to-do list. In a game with so many factors to balance, changing the focus from guessing what will please others, and making it a matter of balancing your priorities.\n\nAdditionally, faction leaders at home and abroad will always be sure to let you know what they want. While many of these missions are natural extensions of your goals, and were probably things you were planning to do anyways, the times when environmentalists demand you build a wind turbine on an island that has no power draw, when the US requests you start producing and exporting oil on an island with no oil deposits, or when lesser powers ask for a loan from a third world country with a GDP of twenty thousand a year, add a bit of a Kafkaesque vibe to the game's events. Fortunately, aside from a lack of favor and bonuses, there's no real downside to ignoring the more insane requests that come your way.\n\nPast the informational upgrades that Tropico 4 provides, there are a fair number of new additions that refine the game, even if they don't revolutionize it. Nearly two dozen buildings give you new options to please tourists and keep your people in line, and new edicts help flesh out your options. On the other hand, the edit system's newest upgrade, requiring a ministry and ministers to enact policy changes, feels a bit like wasted potential. While you appoint islanders, or appoint foreigners, to high government positions, once there, they simply act as edict dispensers. It seems like the game missed a major opportunity for scheming, bootlicking, and potential governmental strife that would have fit in perfectly with the theme of running a tiny Caribbean nation.\n\nMaking your dictator is as fun as ever. Setting up El Presidente's background, rise to power, and traits customizes the way you play fairly well, running from a tourist president to a military dictator, to a sweat-shop operator. In fact, the last is better supported than ever before, with the ability to import raw materials to manufacture into finished goods and ship to America. This new addition to Tropico's economic system is one of the most notable changes, even if it's not a very dramatic one.\n\nWhen it comes time to play the game, unfortunately, the sandbox mode is where it's at. That's not a bad thing by any means, mind you, since it's a hell of a sandbox, and trying to perform the balancing act that the game demands will keep you busy for a while. The downside is that the game's campaign is fairly lackluster. As a huge fan of campaign modes in strategy games, I was pretty deeply disappointed that Tropico 4's ended up being a rather long tutorial, followed by a number of repeating mission objectives and drawn-out scenarios waiting for counters to hit arbitrarily high numbers. The campaign will certainly teach you how to play the game, but with the enhanced data screens and missions provided to you ingame, it would be pretty safe to skip it and get to the meat of the matter.\n\nAll told, Tropico 4 is a good game. While it might not have revolutionized the series, it does a good job of fleshing out some of the options that Tropico 3 lacked. For people interested in city-building games who're new to the series, it'll make an excellent starting point, with more intuitive decision-making than ever before. For series veterans, it'll seem more like a standalone expansion than a full sequel, and it might be good to wait for a Steam sale to bring its price down to match. Either way, it's a game that's well worth having.","April 22, 2014","true","48.8"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

The missions are almost impossible to lose. Instead it just takes more time to win if you're less efficient.\nIf you haven't played the previous installments, there is well plenty enough to explore and keep you busy for quite a while. If you're already familiar with the franchise (I wasn't), then I hear that this installment does not differ very much from Tropico 3 and you might want to treat it, price-wise, more like DLC.\n\nLet me stress that this game is funny. It is riddled with top-notch humour throughout, and the mostly stellar voice acting does justice to the character-specific jokes. I'd even go far enough to call this a good introductory game to the city-building strategy genre: you can easily take your time at every turn, and even if you find the mechanics hard to get around to, the constant jokes should provide a good incentive to stick around.","December 23, 2013","true","64.8"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

It's character and these processes make the game worth it in itself.\n\nUnfortunately, it suffers from a typical, rapid decline in things to do in the later game.

What I did like better in Tropico 3 was the more freedom you got: I like having missions and objectives in all the games I play, because it gives me a path to follow and keeps me engaged while progressing but Tropico 4 has too many constraints IMHO. You'll be flooded by requests with almost no time left to organize your island the way you like, so the management aspect of the game really suffers a bit.\n\nTwo good points which I'd like to highlight are the commentary, which is really funny to listen to and full translations in several languages which are always welcome to me.","July 21, 2015","true","16.5"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","9","11","0","0"

Penultimo says this game is very good. You must buy it and build a paradise.\nThe game is very fun. One of the best city building/economic strategy games I've played.\nI've played only campaign, both main game and modern times. I liked both campaigns. Missions are interesting and different mostly. The game is not realistic, but it reflects the factions pretty well. Communists are always unhappy about healthcare and housing quality, religion faction always wants a new church built and faction leader always gets drunk in the pub, nationalist are killing immigrants, capitalists can do everything for money. Same as in real life.\nThe dialogues and missions are fun and it will make you laugh. There was an earthquake and your mine collapsed and trapped the workers? You paid Chinese experts for the drill which will help to free them? Oh no Presidente the crappy Chinese drill exploded and triggered another earthquake.\nYou can be good dictator, build a paradise where everyone is happy, has a job with high salary and free housing, people are free, etc. Maybe sometimes they get llama flu, but when you have a perfect healthcare it's not a problem.\nOr you could be a ruthless dictator, shooting at the protesters, living in polluted environment, keeping people in poverty, they die from a bad healthcare or starvation, are homeless. Where do their money go then? To your personal Swiss bank account.\nThe graphics are really nice for a strategy game and performance is very good with everything maxed out on a mid range PC.

And fans can live with that, as generally "if it ain't broke..."\n\nSecond, the value of this game assumes one of two paths;\n1) you have been a fan of the series and are considrering T4 as an affordable upgrade to T3, or\n2) you've never played Tropico of any flavor and are wondering where to jump in.\n\nFor Tropico fans:\nLike 1-3, T4 doesn't change a lot of game mechanics. You get a new concept, ministers, which add a little bit more complexity, and you get several new buildings that allow a slightly different late-game strategy, these really become intriguing in sandbox mode (and you need all the DLCs, as expected). BUT, the downside of 4 is the graphics. No really, I have a nice rig and don't expect Steven Spielberg CGI graphics in a game like this, but T1 was better than this. How does it matter? Because you really need to see what you are doing in any build sim, and the graphics on T4 look like 16 bit Sega Genesis stuff. It truly sucks. The additional buildings and the building upgrade mechanics introduced are nice for the numbers nerd, but really the average sim-fan will be like WTF? The strategies you will use overall haven't changed since T1, and T4 doesn't really give you much more to work with, so if you have T3 or are deciding between T3 and T4, unless the price is no object and you have to see for yourself, stay with T3 and wait to see what T5+ may bring. If you are just a Tropico junky like me, the price is still cheap, go ahea, and see if you don't feel the same way. I had to try it to believe, and sure enough, it is true. T3 is the better Tropico.\n\nIf you have never played Tropico:\nLook for the entire Tropico bundle with T3 and T4. It is on sale as well. play T4 first. Then step backwards to T3, give it a whirl, and you will also wonder why they didn't just release a further T3 DLC with some new buildings. It is that much of a let-down. Or just get T3 with the DLC, you'll wish you did in the end.\n\nPS: T4 requires a separate account login to kalypso, if you are like me you hate this stuff. T3 does not. T3 wins hands down.","June 29, 2014","false","262.6"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

It is I, your humble servant, Presidente, here to tell you about the glorious life that awaits you in Tropico... the Fourth!\n\nI love this game. Love it. Can't even begin to express how much love I have for it. Ask me what my most anticipated game at present is, and it's not the next big AAA experience, nor some indie puzzle darling, heck, part of me might even tell you it's not the games I'm trying to make. My most anticipated video game at present is Tropico 5, and that's entirely due to the strength of its predecessor. This game's steady stream of DLC, which recently ended, always got me amazingly excited, and I always tried to buy them whenever I could. As City builders go, it's accessible in all the right ways. Simple, but not dumb.\n\nFirst off, it's one of the most chill games I've ever played, not in its attitude, but in mine, while I play it. With Tropico 4, I like to sit back, relax, smile, and play. The game's script and attitude makes me chuckle--it's a humorous game, and one of the funniest titles to have been released in 2011 (has it really been that long?). There are tons of buildings that all work well together, and the new DLC buildings almost all feel as integral to the gameplay as the stuff that came before.\n\nModern Times, the game's large expansion, was superb, sporting a large campaign that, among other things, involved building a ton of shanties to create a mirror to reflect a giant space laser.\n\nOne thing that really makes Tropico 4 great, though, is the way choice and consequence works. Decisions you make early on in the game can prove to have incredibly positive benefits by the game's end. Or, of course, they can hurt you and drag things out. But... it's hard to lose, and that's a good thing. It's not that it's easy to win, it's just simply hard to completely fail the game. I can't even begin to tell you how many times I've hit a negative balance in my account, only to come out swinging with $50,000 and $60,000 balances quickly stacking up after. Winning is fun, and losing's so rare, it's hard to feel bad about.\n\nThe game is fun, but hey, you don't have to take my word for it, because there's a demo. Go pick it up. Kick back, relax, and give it a go. Have fun. And then realize that Tropico 4's going to give you a ton more of that, but with even more varied and diverse stuff.\n\nTropico is yours for the making.","December 2, 2013","true","68.7"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TekDragon/recommended/57690/","TekDragon","TekDragon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TekDragon/","485 products in account","In Tropico 4 you play the part of a carribean dictator trying to develop various islands while under pressure from world super powers, rebel groups, unique terrain and mission limitations, and your own populace. In each mission you'll invariably start out with little more than a palace, a dock where you load and unload goods and immigrants, a few garages, a construction office for making new buildings, a teamster shop for transporting goods, and a handful of basic tier production facilities like farms, a mine, or a logging hut.\n\nIt's up to you to decide how you're going to advance your people. Will you take a balanced approach that provides your people with lower tier jobs while you construct churches, health clinics, and apartments? Will you focus on factories and import raw materials? Will you rush for highschools and colleges in order to get electricity and higher tier industry? You're El Presidente, so you decide.\n\nInevitably you'll find a strategy that works best for you, and I'm pleased to say that there seems to be a decent number of "winning" strategies. Crafting this strategy will take some effort, though, as you struggle between the competing demands of a tight budget and citizens who have the temerity of wanting basic housing and food.\n\nRegardless of your course in the game, I promise you're going to enjoy the charachters. From your woefully inept assistant and groovy hippie chick to the brash generalisimo and sultry teacher - every charachter brings amusing dialogue with suprisingly good (for the genre) delivery.\n\nThe worst thing I can say about Tropico 4 is that it feels like an expansion pack for Tropico 3. That isn't to say there isn't plenty of content and missions, just that those expecting an engine jump or major changes are going to be dissapointed.

In each mission you'll invariably start out with little more than a palace, a dock where you load and unload goods and immigrants, a few garages, a construction office for making new buildings, a teamster shop for transporting goods, and a handful of basic tier production facilities like farms, a mine, or a logging hut.\n\nIt's up to you to decide how you're going to advance your people. Will you take a balanced approach that provides your people with lower tier jobs while you construct churches, health clinics, and apartments? Will you focus on factories and import raw materials? Will you rush for highschools and colleges in order to get electricity and higher tier industry? You're El Presidente, so you decide.\n\nInevitably you'll find a strategy that works best for you, and I'm pleased to say that there seems to be a decent number of "winning" strategies. Crafting this strategy will take some effort, though, as you struggle between the competing demands of a tight budget and citizens who have the temerity of wanting basic housing and food.\n\nRegardless of your course in the game, I promise you're going to enjoy the charachters. From your woefully inept assistant and groovy hippie chick to the brash generalisimo and sultry teacher - every charachter brings amusing dialogue with suprisingly good (for the genre) delivery.\n\nThe worst thing I can say about Tropico 4 is that it feels like an expansion pack for Tropico 3. That isn't to say there isn't plenty of content and missions, just that those expecting an engine jump or major changes are going to be dissapointed. Tropico 4 uses the exact same engine (with the exact same limitations) as its predecessor.\n\nStill, with the Tropico 4 collector's bundle going on sale regularly, this is an easy recommend.

The game is a sort of mix between the tried and true city building simulator genre made popular by sim city, and strategy games such as Civilization. This is unique, and puts tropico a step higher than other city simulators. The game is also inviting to history buffs as well. Taking place during the cold war, elements such as Military coups, juntas, nuclear proliferation, taiwan's independence, the bikini atoll testing, Nixon, and other people and events are mentioned. The game is quite charming overall, you'll be laughing at several political pundits, witty humor, absurdity of your advisors, and the caracterization of certain ideologies.\n\nBut let's cut to the quick.\n\nTropico is as follows\n\nCity sim with heavy political elements\nYou must juggle relations, and policies, as well as an army and a budget\n\ngraphics are decent\n\nThe sound is incredible\nLovely  soundtrack, with great voice acting.\nSmall spanish grammatical errors\n\nThe gameplay is fluid, full of replay value, and fun.\n\n9/10 would reccomend.\n\n\n","June 15, 2014","true","21.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

In a time when the classic RTS is nearly dead on PC, the Tropico series really stands tall as a remaining vestiage from the old Westwood Studios days.  Now that's not to say that Tropico is a classic PC-styled RTS, because it isn't at all, but it does have that same sort of one-more-game feeling.\n\nTropico is interesting because you never directly control any of your citizens.  You really only can build things and watch and your people use them or not use them.  That may sound boring but it becomes addictive trying to balance the needs of your citizens, versus the missions that the game presents you with.  You may need to strengthen your economy but your citizens are not well educated enough to work in the factories... do you take the time to educate your citizens or do you invite foreign experts to help out or do you pass a law allowing uneducated to work in the factories even though it adds a large risk to their health and well-being?  These kinds of decisions are commonplace in Tropico.  At its very core I find that Tropico is slightly flawed in that each mission can be won by following a bit of a spreadsheet mentality and carefully crafting the perfect island... but finding that out is half the fun of the game.\n\nTropico uses an unusual asthetic, the island dictatorship, and combines it with an interesting tweek to traditional RTS roots and the result is pretty damn fun!  It's also a game with excellent humor and many tongue-in-cheek charactures of the cold war era.  I really recommend grabbing the full Tropico 4 game with DLC if you can find it for 30$ or less.  I got well over 60 hours playing through ONLY the campign of 4 and the expansion.

Tropico 4, on the other hand, provides better balance. It starts off softly and if you play through the tutorial and the campaign mode, it eases the player in pretty good, yet it gets gradually more difficult as the game progresses. Combined with decent 3D-look, more content, the additional challenges, plenty of gameplay available with campaigns, sandbox and scenarios and a good amount of humor; its a great game, good sequel and a nice alternative for Sim City games.","February 11, 2014","true","61.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","1"

I've only played this and #3 at the time of review, but I can tell you the series is fun, as is this game. Each subsequent game doesn't see many improvements other than in graphics, but that's not what this review is about is it?\n\nTropico is a city-building game set in the cold war where you create your benevolent, malevolent, or anything in between dictatorship. It focuses on a single island on a time for you to develop, each with different resources and prime strategies to exploit the island. From tourism, to exporting raw materials, to exporting finished goods. Maintain good relations relations with the super-powers or risk invasion. Receive foreign aid from those you are close to, and military protection from those whose ♥♥♥ you kiss. Or create and independent tropico for all of your natives, imported workers, and tourists (or lack thereof) to enjoy!\n\n+The graphics are superb\n+The sounds are good\n+The controls work just fine\n+It contains enough improvements over #3 to be worth the purchase from recurring fans of the series.\n+Has enough content to sustain the price.\n-Has a really bad marketing strategy. Just look at the DLC list.\n-Has some bugs.\n\nIf you're new to Tropico then this is as good of a place as any to start. If you're old to the series, this is a huge improvement over everything before it. However as all tropico games before it, even if you make housing free, there's still that damn glitch of people simply refusing to use houses and thus ruining the beauty of your tropical nation. I give this game a 4/5. It's almost perfect for what it is, but needs some bugs ironed out (And this far from release? They never will be). Full price of $20? Totally worth it.","November 28, 2015","true","63.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Not me! This game is for everyone who likes building cities but doesn't like staring at spreadsheets for hours.

It's fun and you have to work for it a little, but you get lost in the gameplay easily and it does not feel like a hassle.\n- The music is great, and even though it's a bit repetitive, you just can't get bored of it.

Love them or hate them, I bet you'll enjoy the dialogues.\n- The graphics are not jaw-dropping, but some parts of your island can be truly a sight to behold, and it's up to you to build a beautiful city. It's worth it to zoom in on occasion and just enjoy the view.\n- A very interesting glimpse into the world of politics.

But you can be quite a benevolent leader, too, to avoid social unrest and having to create a police/martial law controlled state.\n\nUsually though, you'll play as a mix of both tyrant and quite legitimately democratically elected el presidente, swaying in one way or the other depending on how much actual support you currently have from your population (and there's a whole bunch of factions to appease, with often contradictory goals and beliefs, but you're going to focus on the most numerous ones, with most voters, won't you - politics, yo).\n\nWhile thematically quite distinct and lighthearted (dousing in cheerful latino music accentuates this), and generally comedic - the game is very much competent at what it does, simulating the needs and wants of your population down to individual people, quite organically punishing you for wrong choices by collapsing your economy and/or throwing you into a bloody civil war.\n\nCampaign makes you go island hopping, trying to build up individual islands of your nation, playing to their individual strenghts, so Tropico is the best nation ever in the entire world... but things of course inevitably but suddenly go south to comedic effects.

Other DLCs however aren't as crucial, but surely can provide some nice buildings like plantations* for more efficient agriculture or cement factory for quicker construction and resource-free export commodity, and there's always some new trait on your leader to select (this tweaks gameplay in some fashion, like more love from some faction or more efficiency in some area) and some specific mission to reinvigorate your desire to develop one more island rather than going pure sandbox again trying your own goals.

It is pleasant to look at and you can almost build your city the way you like. Being on tropical island is refreshing.\n\nYou are basically a standard Latino dictator (parody of Castro) who has to build up his Island into a prosperous city amidst the Cold war. You can choose to make your government more communist oriented or capitalist. In doing so you get the support from one of the Super powers. Similarly, you get various benefits or disadvantages in your international relations depending on how you run your island.\n\nFarming, industry, tourism, education, transport are some of the many aspects of the economy you'll have to manage in order to keep your islanders fed and happy.\n\nThis is only a single player game though. The only thing you can do is upload your city in sort of high scores fashion where other folks can check it out. But for some reason I had trouble doing so.\n\nIf you can get it cheap (on sale) then you can easily enjoy it for couple of days at least. Even if you get Tropico 5 when it comes out, some of the content will stay unique as in Tropico 3 like the radio broadcaster/ commentator and music etc.","August 14, 2014","true","2.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Now add eight bickering political factions and five high-and-mighty international powers, each with their own surprisingly intelligent and hilarious writing, and a 20-mission campaign that's proving to be incredibly addictive. While the first few years on your island tend to become repetitive as you log more and more hours, each island presents its own challenges, and the leaders you select (or create) always add their own twist to the mission. Finally, in a major departure from most civ-building games, the end goal isn't to build up a military; instead, your army is but one of the many things you need to take care of, and in certain cases can be completely ignored. Very happy to have paid extra to get this in the Humble Bundle, and will almost definitely get 5 when it comes out.","October 22, 2013","true","194.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/englishrepublic/recommended/57690/","englishrepublic","Wizard of Jazz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/englishrepublic/","225 products in account","Tropico 4, for lack of a better definition, is kind of like SimCity. But where SimCity stands as placing you as the mayor of a common, modern American city, Tropico puts you in the position of "El Presidente", the leader of a small Caribbean island nation at the height of the Cold War.\n\nTropico 4 is a delightful game, and carries a number of excellent qualities. It exhibits a long, engaging campaign and offers moderate replay value for fans of city-building simulations. However, the true shine to Tropico is the tongue-in-cheek humor that underlies all gameplay and all story elements. The game has a relatively realistic basis to itself, but doesn't hesitate to recognize itself as what it essentially is - a Caribbean Dictator SimCity. And it does it wonderfully. Not only does the game make a couple of cheeky references, but it takes the mickey out of nearly everything within itself and keeps the mood lighthearted.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, Tropico 4 maintains a solid city-building mechanic, but tacks on the added difficulty of managing and keeping the numerous factions and foreign countries in and around your island happy. There are the profit-obsessed Capitalists, the overzealous Communists, the hippy-heavy Environmentalists, and even skinhead Nationalists. Paired with the United States and the USSR breathing down your neck, it makes for interesting and suprisingly difficult gameplay. However, you will be rewarded graciously for dealing with each of the factions and nations as you grow your legacy as "El Presidente".\n\nI would recommend this game to most people, but this is a DEFINITE BUY for fans of city-builders.\n\nAlso - to all you soon-to-be Presidentes, heres a few helpful tips:\n1. Set up your economy first. Always.\n2. Clinics and Churches are more necessary than you may think.\n3. I learned this late in my play sessions: Media is suprisingly helpful. You'd be suprised what a single newspaper can do.\n4. You DON'T need the DLC to play and have fun.\n5. In Vanilla Tropico 4 - power is for ♥♥♥♥♥es. Only make power plants if you are rich or really need them.\n6. In Modern Times Tropico 4 - power is for pros. Power is... well, power.\n7. Industry will always make you more money than agriculture.\n8. Agriculture is always more stable than industry.\n9. Remember to turn off Open Doors when you have enough people. This will eventually come to you in time.\n10. Don't be an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Social Security is the best thing you can have if you know what you're doing.\n\nHave fun, Presidente!","August 29, 2014","true","134.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

There are options galore, from being a totalitarian dictator to gracious president, a religious zealot to intellectual know-it-all, and more with factions to go along with them that will generally respect you for your actions towards that.\n\nThat said, I'm only recommending this game because it's just easier to get this than Tropico 3 and it's expansion. If you already own tropico 3 and it's absolute power expansion, there really isn't much here. What you do get is some new voice-acted characters and storylines, which are nifty throughout the campaign and during side missions you get during your sandbox games, but as far as down-to-the-core gameplay goes you won't find any differences other than a couple new structures and a new voice actor for El Presidente's avatar.\n\nRegardless of the fact it is so similar to it's predecessor though, the tropico franchise is still unbelievably good as a sim and strategy game with a great sense of humor, and it really shows in this game where the humor factor goes up quite a bit due to that one major addition of the voiced characters. It's not simcity, it's not banished, and it sure as hell isn't Men of War or Company of Heroes, but if you want something that does a really good job of managing to fall somewhere right in the middle of all of those games, Tropico has you covered.\n\nAnd the 5th game is coming out next week, so here's to hoping it's godlike!","May 18, 2014","true","34.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/blue_award/recommended/57690/","blue_award","Blue Award","http://steamcommunity.com/id/blue_award/","803 products in account","City building and management simulator with a (tongue-in-cheek) twist - you play as dictator of a banana republic, some imaginary Carribean island nation of Tropico. This doesn't automatically make you a malevolent ruler, although the option is very much on the table. But you can be quite a benevolent leader, too, to avoid social unrest and having to create a police/martial law controlled state.\n\nUsually though, you'll play as a mix of both tyrant and quite legitimately democratically elected el presidente, swaying in one way or the other depending on how much actual support you currently have from your population (and there's a whole bunch of factions to appease, with often contradictory goals and beliefs, but you're going to focus on the most numerous ones, with most voters, won't you - politics, yo).\n\nWhile thematically quite distinct and lighthearted (dousing in cheerful latino music accentuates this), and generally comedic - the game is very much competent at what it does, simulating the needs and wants of your population down to individual people, quite organically punishing you for wrong choices by collapsing your economy and/or throwing you into a bloody civil war.\n\nCampaign makes you go island hopping, trying to build up individual islands of your nation, playing to their individual strenghts, so Tropico is the best nation ever in the entire world... but things of course inevitably but suddenly go south to comedic effects. Campaign missions have their unique predetermined goals and events, however otherwise play mostly like a sandbox game, and there's of course actual sandbox mode as well to keep you rolling.\n\nBy now, at least gameplay wise, you'd maybe rather look at Tropico 5 which mixes things a bit more with multiple eras/stages of development, but this doesn't suddenly make Tropico 4 any worse or its campaign(s) no longer distinct.\n\nAs for DLC business - there's plenty here in Tropico 4, and you definitely do want Modern Times which is a big expansion with its own campaign and new versions of many buildings. Other DLCs however aren't as crucial, but surely can provide some nice buildings like plantations* for more efficient agriculture or cement factory for quicker construction and resource-free export commodity, and there's always some new trait on your leader to select (this tweaks gameplay in some fashion, like more love from some faction or more efficiency in some area) and some specific mission to reinvigorate your desire to develop one more island rather than going pure sandbox again trying your own goals. It's just that for what they provide, they kind of seem individually quite pricey.\n\n(*sometimes new stuff may imbalance original campaign missions a bit, like I believe there was a mission with an island which was supposed to be agriculturally challenged and even disabled farms for you.. but didn't disable plantations (oversight?) so you could still start growing plants if you desired - not like your people would die of hunger otherwise unless you imported lots of food - you still could've had cattle ranches, it's just the mission was supposed to make you focus solely on industry rather than agriculture or tourism).","July 8, 2014","true","74.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

If yes, you'll dig this, if not, pass. This game's called Tropico 4 but it's nominally an expansion pack to Tropico 3, though a large one at that. Tropico is a nation-building game in the vein of the Anno series, though not nearly as in-depth and with a sense of humor. It features a few new buildings and edicts and some new mechanics, as well as an entirely new campaign. A few of the added structures make things a little easier- like the salt mine, a mine that never runs out, and the chemical plant, a factory that requires no input. The mechanic improvements serve to streamline the gameplay and the added buildings are interesting. The campaign is quite good and about 40 hours long, a decent amount of play can be had. There is of course a sandbox mode if all you wish to build is an island. I very much recommend this game if you enjoy city or nation building games.","April 15, 2013","true","63.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

However, what gives Tropico 4 an edge over 3, are following reasons:\n\nBetter feedback. I remember playing 3 and sometimes getting confused where I'm going wrong. 4 fixes that very well.\nCampaign. It's funny, it's lengthy and overall well done.\nDLC. Or more like "Modern Times". It's pretty much the main reason how Tropico 4 stands on it's own legs rather than feeling rewarmed 3. Other DLCs are... eh. Unnecessary.\nQuests inside of game. They repeat themselves in the end but gives little bit more dynamic in game and goals to keep things interesting.\nSmall improved things you'll see there and there.\nI still recommend getting 4 over 3, especially if you're new to series and even if you don't own 4 yet but you own 3, there's no reason to get 4 from the sales.\n\nIt's a game which 3 should've truly been.","December 30, 2011","true","130.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","2","2","2","0"

This is my first Tropica game and I find it very appealing. It is pretty f-ing awesome. I literally just played Tropico 4 for 10 hours straight. This game is one of the best city builder games I have ever had the pleasure to binge play. The controls are super easy to understand, even my grandmother could figure them out. The graphics are pretty good, better than most game I have played on my pc but nothing to write home about. One of the best things in life is laughter and Tropica 4 keeps me laughing while I play and build my beautiful island. Your little helpers if you choose to have them on are funny looking characters that make me laugh just looking at them but thewy are also really helpful. Everything is set up so you can place everything  with ease and lightning speed. Overall Tropica 4 is a great buy and you will certainly get hours and hours of game playing, island building, throwing people in jail for no reason kind of fun out of it.","November 23, 2014","true","32.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Highly acclaimed with a ton of rave reviews, but is this game as good as people say? Yes. Yes it is.\n\nIf you are new to the Tropico franchise like I was, then here is a very quick rundown of the game:\n\nYou are El Presidente, the leader of a small Carribean 'paradise' called Tropico. Your main aim is to transform Tropico, an underdeveloped and practically lifeless bunch of Islands, into a world superpower by any and all means necessary. You will  straight up notice some very funny parallels to the real world as Tropico is basically Cuba, and El Presidente is based off a number of socialist and communist figures such as Fidel Castro and Che Guevera.\n\nThroughout the campaigns in the game you will have total control over Tropico which will see you lead your state onto the international platform for either good, or bad reasons. You will need to balance your popularity with your people by pleasing the various factions present within your society; something that is easier said than done. Similarly, you need to stay on the right side of the world superpowers as the game is based during the Cold War and your decisions will vary your popularity with the United States of America (US), or the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR). There are other world leaders but they don't threaten to invade you, well, as far as i'm aware anyway. Alongside all of this, you must work to transform Tropico by investing money into things like housing, welfare, food and resources, government, tourism, etc. Make sure you don't blow your budget too badly though because the world superpowers don't like broke countries. Also, prepare for major natural disasters that will kill your people, ruin your buildings and crops.\n\n\nSome people may read this and say 'This is just a mix of the Sims/Cities mixed with Democracy or something like that'. In a way maybe it is, but here is why I think Tropico is way better. Political corruption is encouraged in the game.\n\nNeed to get more products out? Run a sweatshop. Rebels annoying you? Wire tap houses, impose martial law, conscript citizens into your army against their will. Getting too many immigrants and have shacks overunning your beautiful paradise? Force emigration. Faction leader or protesters becoming too popular? Have them eliminated or arrested for herecy. Minister of Foreign Affairs made a bad decision? Fire him and arrest him. . . See what I mean? How does this not sound fun?\n\n\n\nIf you like being the corrupt leader of Cuba and focusing more on being famous than the wellbeing of your citizens who you can force to never leave a state with poor housing, bad health conditions, slave labour, conscription, propeganda, rebels, frequent natural disasters, and 'accidents' or disappearences happening way too reguarly.. than this is the game for you.\n\nBuy it. Play it. Live it.\n\nTROPICO 4.\n\n","January 22, 2015","true","21.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

To achieve that you can choose your way of ruling, go all in with the old fashioned way (the military way) or go all peace loving dictator.\nThe first couple of hours was a learning course kinda bored me but then when i played on sandbox mode, a friend sent me a text asking how fun this game is.

Although your workers will sit around with no active projects and there are 10 buildings that need to be built it is still an excellent game. If you like city builders where you can be what ever type of presedente you want, than this game is for you!\n10/10 would kill the rebels again.\n\nP.S.

It's pretty challenging on first playing, however the controls arent that difficult and tactics come naturally. I would only really recommend this to people who have played other games like it in the past and enjoyed them (Example: Sim City) If you've never played a game of this genre I wouldn't recommend this as a starting point, I'd probably recommend Sim City.\n\nCharacter customisation could use a little work, what with the head graphics clipping through hats, hair, accesories. Although, its pretty nice to have the option of not going with the pre-sets. The amount of detailed graphics that have been added, especially where structures are concerned makes this a very beautiful even on low graphical settings.\n\nThe general public in this game all have their own "personalities" made up of individual thoughts and needs, some needing more of one thing than others. Another nice feature that sits hand in hand with this is that if they do anything wrong, there are five actions you can take against them, avalible at your discretion\n\nAdditionally its nice that your character is actually present on the map, and are usable however its also nice that you dont HAVE to use them, they will get on with there own stuff while you concentate on maintaining the town.\n\nLastly sandbox mode is hugely customisable and although on first glance the settings avaliable dont seem like they'll change much, I've played many games on sandbox that have all been vastly different and not just because of my tactics and style.","January 8, 2013","true","34.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/IamQaboos/recommended/57690/","IamQaboos","Q A B O O S","http://steamcommunity.com/id/IamQaboos/","105 products in account","Welcome to the fourth installment of the popular 'Tropico' franchise. Highly acclaimed with a ton of rave reviews, but is this game as good as people say? Yes. Yes it is.\n\nIf you are new to the Tropico franchise like I was, then here is a very quick rundown of the game:\n\nYou are El Presidente, the leader of a small Carribean 'paradise' called Tropico. Your main aim is to transform Tropico, an underdeveloped and practically lifeless bunch of Islands, into a world superpower by any and all means necessary. You will  straight up notice some very funny parallels to the real world as Tropico is basically Cuba, and El Presidente is based off a number of socialist and communist figures such as Fidel Castro and Che Guevera.\n\nThroughout the campaigns in the game you will have total control over Tropico which will see you lead your state onto the international platform for either good, or bad reasons. You will need to balance your popularity with your people by pleasing the various factions present within your society; something that is easier said than done. Similarly, you need to stay on the right side of the world superpowers as the game is based during the Cold War and your decisions will vary your popularity with the United States of America (US), or the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR). There are other world leaders but they don't threaten to invade you, well, as far as i'm aware anyway. Alongside all of this, you must work to transform Tropico by investing money into things like housing, welfare, food and resources, government, tourism, etc. Make sure you don't blow your budget too badly though because the world superpowers don't like broke countries. Also, prepare for major natural disasters that will kill your people, ruin your buildings and crops.\n\n\nSome people may read this and say 'This is just a mix of the Sims/Cities mixed with Democracy or something like that'. In a way maybe it is, but here is why I think Tropico is way better. Political corruption is encouraged in the game.\n\nNeed to get more products out? Run a sweatshop. Rebels annoying you? Wire tap houses, impose martial law, conscript citizens into your army against their will. Getting too many immigrants and have shacks overunning your beautiful paradise? Force emigration. Faction leader or protesters becoming too popular? Have them eliminated or arrested for herecy. Minister of Foreign Affairs made a bad decision? Fire him and arrest him. . . See what I mean? How does this not sound fun?\n\n\n\nIf you like being the corrupt leader of Cuba and focusing more on being famous than the wellbeing of your citizens who you can force to never leave a state with poor housing, bad health conditions, slave labour, conscription, propeganda, rebels, frequent natural disasters, and 'accidents' or disappearences happening way too reguarly.. than this is the game for you.\n\nBuy it. Play it. Live it.\n\nTROPICO 4.\n\n","January 22, 2015","true","21.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This is my first Tropica game and I find it very appealing. It is pretty f-ing awesome. I literally just played Tropico 4 for 10 hours straight. This game is one of the best city builder games I have ever had the pleasure to binge play. The controls are super easy to understand, even my grandmother could figure them out. The graphics are pretty good, better than most game I have played on my pc but nothing to write home about. One of the best things in life is laughter and Tropica 4 keeps me laughing while I play and build my beautiful island. Your little helpers if you choose to have them on are funny looking characters that make me laugh just looking at them but thewy are also really helpful. Everything is set up so you can place everything  with ease and lightning speed. Overall Tropica 4 is a great buy and you will certainly get hours and hours of game playing, island building, throwing people in jail for no reason kind of fun out of it.","November 23, 2014","true","32.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kreegath/recommended/57690/","Kreegath","Kreegath","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kreegath/","227 products in account","Not having played any other game in the series, getting into Tropico 4 I was afraid of running face first into a learning curve wall, but was pleasantly surprised by the way the game was designed. It's intuitive and does a good job at explaining the core mechanics without holding your hand whilst talking down to you.\n\nWhat I mean is that Tropico 4 is extremely accessible. You almost cannot lose unless you overreach something fierce. Even then, you can tell when things aren't working out, and you're more often than not given time to rectify the situation. The difficulty lies in the unique stipulations and events of each individual scenario, which actually switches the gameplay up to the point where you get to work with all your tools and not just do the same build over and over. I appreciate that, because it's a welcome change of pace from a lot of other strategy games where you just find "the best" way to play and then repeat until the end credits.\n\nThe ambience and tone of the game is spot on for what it goes for, keeping it light and humorous. It's chock-full of caricatured and satirized references to real life leaders and personalities, with plenty of jokes and easter eggs to keeps you entertained even when the gameplay starts getting repetetive and slow.\nGraphically, it's ok without being especially impressive. Thankfully it's not going for impressive, though, but rather functionally, which it is. You can run it on most systems without any problems. Everything's clear and you won't have any problems getting into the mood of the game.\n\nIf you're an achievement hunter looking for another perfect clear, be aware that some of the "harder" achievements are rare because they're incredibly grind-heavy. I got stuck playing the same sandbox map over and over for more than 20 games after having cleared the campaigns, in order to get all character traits to level 5. Took hours and wasn't much fun after a while, although I hadn't maximized my char traits beforehand so some levels had been wasted.\n\nWhen it comes to DLC, I would actually advice against getting "Modern Times", since the buildings you get completely break the game. You will get stuff that just replaces everything you can get in the base game, and all difficulty is thrown out the window. It could be fun for a couple of games or a long sandbox game, but it'll get tired and it'll get tired fast. Just isn't worth it in my opinion.\n\nIn conclusion, I warmly recommend it. Tropico 4 is a game that'll keep you busy for hours on end, and keep you entertained throughout. It's got character, atmosphere and tongue-in-cheek satire. It immerses you in the world of banana republics and continuously challenges you with new and innovative problems. Just don't bother with the "Modern Times" DLC, as it kind of breaks the flow of the game and makes it much too easy and simple. If it's on sale, get it! If it's not, but you like city builder strategy games, why not pick it up?","December 28, 2014","true","115.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Here are my likes and dislikes:\nPros:\n- Great sense of humor (no matter if you are interested in politic related issues or not the humor is great! building descriptions, radio messages, advisors, missions all are really funny - even for an adult player).\n- A decent graphic with a very detailed zoom-in option\n- 3-scale game speed up option - I usualy play in the fastest game mode\n- a wide variety of buildings - a lot of industrial buildings, tourist attractions, housing and social facilities and governmental institutions\n- interesting economy and political mechanisms -> as the el-presidente you make very important decisions (concerning economy, defence, external or interial policy, education etc.) and you can see what are the effects of your choices\n- factions - citizens in your island are diveded into a few major factions (religious, nationalists, communist etc.). Your job is to make them happy... or make them be quit :)\n- a lot of ways you can deal with unhappy citizens - you can bribe one, arrest him/her, arrange accident :) etc.\n- Music -> you can't hold your feet calm while playing to this caribbean music :)\n\nCons:\n- a little bit similar development pattern - as the objectives in every mission are different, there is a very similar pattern to complete them. You need a lot of money. You can either develop your industry or invest in tourism. However, once you will find the pattern you like the most you do the same thing in every mission. All over again.\n- Bugged mission 18 (however bug doesn't occur always)\n- music - at the beginning you really like it... but after some time you discover that there are just 3 or 4 songs.... for hours of playing way too little.\n- it is difficult to lose the game - I am in mission 19 and so far I haven't lost one single game (although I needed to restart one mission :P )\n\nFinally, my opinion is... you definately should buy this game. If you enjoy strategy games based on economy and political grounds it is something for you. After hours of playing there is always something new you haven't seen yet. And after all, it is so fun to be El Presidente :P","September 16, 2014","true","75.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kryskiller666/recommended/57690/","kryskiller666","BadassFreeman","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kryskiller666/","217 products in account","I played the ♥♥♥♥ out of this game (a DRM-Free version), over 200 hours, completed the normal game (no DLC's) and most challenges, and well...After seeing the messed up sale of Steam the other day, that had Tropico 4 with all DLC's at 99% instead of the 85% it was supposed to have (Instead of cost like 4€'s, it costed 0,27€'s), I decided to pick it up, mainly for the DLC's.\n\nNow, I sure had fun with this game. I f#cking love "Sim City-like games", and Tropico is no different. Instead of being the God and Savior of a big-♥♥♥ city, you're the main ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of a little island. Yeah, that's it, you're the government, and just as in reality, government is corrupted, and filled with egomaniacs and a bunch of fat motherf#ckers. So that's a positive point to the game, it does feel right, it does make you feel like you're the Evil Morgan Freeman, and you're about to ruin arround half a thousand people's lifes.\n\nThe game, sadly, has a few flaws. I haven't fully tested the DLC's yet, but it seems that some of them where just cosmetic items for the Presidente. Now that's lazy. Another big problem that I have found, is how inferior the Steam version looks, compared to the DRM-Free version: That one went smoother, with much less loading times and ♥♥♥♥. I also had trouble making a new Kalipso account, but that's not the game's fault, the Outlook/Hotmail servers like to annoy their users, for some reason.\n\nAnother problem I have with the game, is the soundtrack. Now, hear me on this one: It's quite great. It fits perfectly! So, what's wrong with it? It's repetitive as hell. After playing over 30 games that can easily take over 20-40 minutes, the soundtrack turns into a real pain, specially if you never liked that kind of music to begin with.\n\nThe gameplay, though, it's great. Balanced and fun. My only issue, is that I don't usually get to see Rebel attacks and violent stuff. Not sure if I was too good at the game, or it's too darn easy. I do find Dark Souls an easy game (just with some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t-forced Multiplayer, the ♥♥♥♥♥iest Games for Windows servers I've seen, and a few of GOOD bosses here and there), so it's problaby I'm just crazy and nuts.\n\nI still think this game can be easily recommended to Strategy players, but be aware, this kind of games have NOTHING TO DO with other strategy games like Age of Empires. You do NOT fight other players, you fight the system. Or in this case, you're the system, and you beat up anything on your way.\n\nFor this Sale's price, I think it's a darn fine deal. If the sale finishes, you should probably wait for another one, or go look for a DRM-Free version of it, there are plenty over there, even in retail versions, I believe.\n\nBut now, if the game would stop to tell me that Tropico 5 has been released...WHY WOULD I CARE ABOUT TROPICO 5, IF I'M ON THE 4 ONE!? LET ME FINISH THIS ONE FIRST, DON'T YOU THINK!?","August 19, 2014","true","8.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

Finally I got a good sale on it and was stoked to give it a shot. Sure enough this game is fantastic. Definetely has the same feel as other city building games but with some layers of complexity that feel really nice. Instead of putting you in a world that doesn't really make sense or is obviously fictional they give you something that could actually be plausible. I never knew I would enjoy playing the part of a island dictator but sure enough it's an original enough idea that I have been hooked for hours now. If you are on the fence about this game I would say definetely give it a try.

I love all the options that you have in this game for buildings, laws etc. Gameplay is great, graphics are great, and maps are all very well sized and laid out. Much better than SimCity (map size was really my only complaint in that game).\n\nAnyways, if you like city builders, do yourself a favour and check out Tropico 4, or 3 for that matter.

It's pretty challenging on first playing, however the controls arent that difficult and tactics come naturally. I would only really recommend this to people who have played other games like it in the past and enjoyed them (Example: Sim City) If you've never played a game of this genre I wouldn't recommend this as a starting point, I'd probably recommend Sim City.\n\nCharacter customisation could use a little work, what with the head graphics clipping through hats, hair, accesories. Although, its pretty nice to have the option of not going with the pre-sets. The amount of detailed graphics that have been added, especially where structures are concerned makes this a very beautiful even on low graphical settings.\n\nThe general public in this game all have their own "personalities" made up of individual thoughts and needs, some needing more of one thing than others. Another nice feature that sits hand in hand with this is that if they do anything wrong, there are five actions you can take against them, avalible at your discretion\n\nAdditionally its nice that your character is actually present on the map, and are usable however its also nice that you dont HAVE to use them, they will get on with there own stuff while you concentate on maintaining the town.\n\nLastly sandbox mode is hugely customisable and although on first glance the settings avaliable dont seem like they'll change much, I've played many games on sandbox that have all been vastly different and not just because of my tactics and style.","January 8, 2013","true","34.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Finally I got a good sale on it and was stoked to give it a shot. Sure enough this game is fantastic. Definetely has the same feel as other city building games but with some layers of complexity that feel really nice. Instead of putting you in a world that doesn't really make sense or is obviously fictional they give you something that could actually be plausible. I never knew I would enjoy playing the part of a island dictator but sure enough it's an original enough idea that I have been hooked for hours now. If you are on the fence about this game I would say definetely give it a try. If you enjoy games like Simcity or Banished it felt like a mix of the two with extra polital elements tacked on.","August 18, 2014","true","21.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

As the supreme ruler, you have power over everything. But don't take this to mean you can do whatever you want. You have to manage relations with the various factions on the island. If you treat them badly, they will make your life difficult. Some may even join the rebels and contend militarily for power. You must do this while keeping funds up and trying to pad your offshore bank account as much as possible.\n\nThe game has a robust campaign that's relatively fun to play through. Sandbox is ok, I mainly use it for fooling around and trying self-imposed goals. There are a massive amount of user created challenges. Those are where the true fun comes in. But these things can become boring after time.\n\nIt has some DLC. The best bang for your buck would come from Modern Times. Modern Times adds a ton of buildings and edicts. It also has it's own campaigns. The other DLCs are ok, but they don't really warrant the $5 price point. They add traits for your president, a special building, a mission, and some vanity items. Get them on sale.\n\nIn all, I would reccommend this for anyone who enjoys sim games and some that don't. It is much easier to get into than some of the others (I'm looking at you Cities XL)\n\nEdit: The soundtrack is also fabulous. Very nice island themed music","December 17, 2013","true","25.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You don't have to get all the DLC to enjoy it, but it really helps with some of the various buildings it adds.\n\nThere are a few glitches and problems with it:  you can't easily set up a just-tourism island like you can an island for exports.  And occasionally the Modern Times stuff will peek into a not-Modern-Times game to see what's up.  However, these are minor issues that are easily avoided.

We are preparing a counter-attack as we speak!" - Yes, that was an actual natural disaster tornado. Your military commander may not be the wisest choice to be in charge of emergency planning when it comes to acts of god.\n\n\n\nYour little tropical island starts off as being pretty much on par with a third world country... by the end of your reign, however, you can wind up being a nuclear superpower.\n\nYou juggle a mixture of things, such as finances and foreign aid, to keeping foreign interests happy so they don't invaid you, fighting off communist rebels, keeping the various factions happy, and exploiting your island's natural resources or turning it into a tropical vacation paradise.\n\n"America's such a great country... and that's why we're imposing a 'Freedom Tax' on countries such as yourself. We're not saying we definitely WILL nuke you, but you know, mistakes happen."\n\n\n\nThe single player campaign is witty and remarkably adept at gradually teaching you the ropes, and then the advanced stuff. I don't even really like the standard campaigns for city builder games... they're always so dry and boring, so I normally just stick to the sandbox mode. In Tropico 4, the campaign's well worth indulging in.\n\nThe only real problem I had with Tropico 4, was that it has a LOT of DLC, and while it's not "needed" to play the game, it seriously does ramp up the enjoyment factor considerably. The DLC that's presented is definitely worth it, though, and reasonably priced. The modern times DLC is the largest by far, providing a ton more buildings, a new mechanic (a yearly timeline wherein new stuff is added gradually over time), and an entire new campaign which picks up from where the original campaign left off. So... it's a mixed blessing. Even without the DLC, T4's well worth it, but you'll probably find yourself picking up a ton of extra DLC simply because what's offered is a really good value for the cost compared to most DLC.\n\n\n\nFinal Verdict:\n\nExcellent city-builder style game. The size and tech level of your city is a bit limited, since you're working on a tropical island rather than a north american city. The DLC can help fix this (especially modern times), but there's a lot of DLC, and despite being worth it, it can really tack on to the cost. I'd suggest picking it up during a steam sale if you're low on cash, but it's worth it even at full price.\n\nIt would not be unrealistic to rate Tropico 4 at 90-95%; not many games can claim that... there's just really nothing BAD about the game, and a massive pile of stuff that's awesome. Really, the only complaints I can come up with are minor nitpicks at best and a few bugs in campaign mode.","November 27, 2013","true","159.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I was wrong to be skeptical. Tropico 4 is fun, vibrant, and doesn't take itself too seriously. You can choose to be a ruthless dictator, a tourism magnate, an oil tycoon, or a ruler for the people, by the people. The choices on your rulership and the comedy from your advisors make the game stand out. So far, I've enjoyed just about every aspect of the game and a play session doesn't last too long. The music is tropical and fun. I can't recommend this game more for civ-building games.","January 3, 2014","true","30.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The graphics are pretty good, better than most game I have played on my pc but nothing to write home about. One of the best things in life is laughter and Tropica 4 keeps me laughing while I play and build my beautiful island. Your little helpers if you choose to have them on are funny looking characters that make me laugh just looking at them but thewy are also really helpful. Everything is set up so you can place everything  with ease and lightning speed.

This game is one of the best city builder games I have ever had the pleasure to binge play. The controls are super easy to understand, even my grandmother could figure them out. The graphics are pretty good, better than most game I have played on my pc but nothing to write home about. One of the best things in life is laughter and Tropica 4 keeps me laughing while I play and build my beautiful island. Your little helpers if you choose to have them on are funny looking characters that make me laugh just looking at them but thewy are also really helpful. Everything is set up so you can place everything  with ease and lightning speed.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MrWallet/recommended/57690/","MrWallet","Mr. Wallet","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MrWallet/","334 products in account","This game is really great and you should buy it.\n\nFirst, the cons:\n- There's a bit of a curve in figuring out exactly what the people think is reasonable (for example, protip: housing prices should be 1/3 of the person's salary, rounded down, and entertainment should be exactly their salary).\n- The missions are very scripted and the gameplay very freeform, resulting in occasional basically-guaranteed losses or complete non-challenges after you complete an objective and the next impossible-to-predict-the-first-time-trying scripted event occurs.\n- Being a tyrant is really underpowered vs. being totally nice and helpful.\n\nBesides that, this game is packed with wit, charm, and fun. Tropico 3 was just a remake of Tropico 1, but this game really takes strides in perfecting the forumula. Any good sim-builder needs lots of knobs and buttons to fiddle with, and this game has a bunch of them - and best of all, they're generally not packed painfully into drab numerical menus. There are no up and down buttons for employment; you actually click a socket for a worker's face to close it off and limit how many people the building will employ. This and *actually helpful* tooltips (some devs get it wrong, somehow) make the game immediately accessible. You'll have your work cut out for you balancing the desires of the various factions, and who you decide to please and who you decide to push to the brink of rebellion will often depend entirely on the resources of the island and your mission objectives. A huge problem with most games of this genre is the tendency for a single strategy to win every time; while this is still present in Tropico 4 to some degree, the missions are crafted carefully enough, with enough special conditions to disrupt your winning strategies, that it's less of a problem here than in any other game I've ever played in this genre.\n\nThe writing in the game is top-notch and if you don't find yourself smirking from time to time at the bald-faced satire, then you need to get your sense of humor checked out. This game finds creative ways to poke fun at cold-war banana republics, stereotypes, popular video games, and more. At no point do you feel guilty for being a big, stupid tyrant, because all the international powers are bigger, stupider, and more tyrannical. This gives a fun sense of empathy to El Presidente despite his self-serving nature, and motivates you to shelter the helpless people of Tropico from the uncaring ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s on both sides of the iron curtain... and maybe launder some tax money as payment while you're doing them the service.\n\nI can't recommend this game highly enough. I've bought all the DLC and earned every achievement because I can't get enough of El Presidente.

The gameplay is simple enough to learn but complex enough to keep you occupied.  Disasters, faction challenges, foreign powers and story objectives make the game even more challenging. The game is rife with political and social commentary that may provide a chuckle or two. The soundtrack is enjoyable even though it’s fairly repetitive. It should be noted that the population limit is low compared to other city sims and roads are easily congested due the lack of multiple lane highways. Still, these are only minor frustrations in an otherwise entertaining game nonetheless!

It's intuitive and does a good job at explaining the core mechanics without holding your hand whilst talking down to you.\n\nWhat I mean is that Tropico 4 is extremely accessible. You almost cannot lose unless you overreach something fierce. Even then, you can tell when things aren't working out, and you're more often than not given time to rectify the situation. The difficulty lies in the unique stipulations and events of each individual scenario, which actually switches the gameplay up to the point where you get to work with all your tools and not just do the same build over and over. I appreciate that, because it's a welcome change of pace from a lot of other strategy games where you just find "the best" way to play and then repeat until the end credits.\n\nThe ambience and tone of the game is spot on for what it goes for, keeping it light and humorous. It's chock-full of caricatured and satirized references to real life leaders and personalities, with plenty of jokes and easter eggs to keeps you entertained even when the gameplay starts getting repetetive and slow.\nGraphically, it's ok without being especially impressive. Thankfully it's not going for impressive, though, but rather functionally, which it is. You can run it on most systems without any problems. Everything's clear and you won't have any problems getting into the mood of the game.\n\nIf you're an achievement hunter looking for another perfect clear, be aware that some of the "harder" achievements are rare because they're incredibly grind-heavy. I got stuck playing the same sandbox map over and over for more than 20 games after having cleared the campaigns, in order to get all character traits to level 5. Took hours and wasn't much fun after a while, although I hadn't maximized my char traits beforehand so some levels had been wasted.\n\nWhen it comes to DLC, I would actually advice against getting "Modern Times", since the buildings you get completely break the game. You will get stuff that just replaces everything you can get in the base game, and all difficulty is thrown out the window. It could be fun for a couple of games or a long sandbox game, but it'll get tired and it'll get tired fast. Just isn't worth it in my opinion.\n\nIn conclusion, I warmly recommend it. Tropico 4 is a game that'll keep you busy for hours on end, and keep you entertained throughout. It's got character, atmosphere and tongue-in-cheek satire. It immerses you in the world of banana republics and continuously challenges you with new and innovative problems. Just don't bother with the "Modern Times" DLC, as it kind of breaks the flow of the game and makes it much too easy and simple. If it's on sale, get it! If it's not, but you like city builder strategy games, why not pick it up?","December 28, 2014","true","115.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's not only a great city building / politics hybrid game, but there's a lot of humor as well.  The soundtrack is very authentic and enjoyable and all in spanish, but very catchy and sets the mood well.  The campaign is very interesting throughout all 20 missions, this is a game that can make you lose track of time, Civ 5 style.  Once you learn the basic controls and how to setup your initial economy, you'll be hooked on this game and want to fire up a big ol' cigar!

Once again Tropico delivers a fantastic city builder / economic management game and for those of you who have played Tropico 3, you will find that in terms of the interface and the graphics, not a great deal has changed. The graphics are slighty prettier (but then they were pretty good in 3 imho) and there are a couple of tweaks to the interface that might take 30 seconds or so to get used to, but thats about it.\n\nWhat it does bring however, is more depth in terms of gameplay and a more story orientated campaign to play through. There are a number of new buildings which have been introduced with their own functions, but for me the biggest improvement in the gameplay is the way the scenarios work. When campaign missions are initially presented, it isnt like 3 where you have to hit a specific goal or goals persay, more that in order to reach your goals you will have to fulfill and complete a number of in game missions in order to win the scenario. Along side this are a vast number of other missions that will pop up, which if you complete might award you money, faction respect, foreign power respect etc etc; you get the idea. This makes playing through the campaign (and even doing the sandbox island) a lot more fun.\n\nI have only 2 minor complaints; I wish the stats that you are presented in the almanac could be drilled down into more. I love stats and being able to have a little more depth would be great. The second, is that I miss the radio DJ from Tropico 3 :(\n\nOn a final note, I would totally reccomend that anyone buying this (especially if you are coming off the back of Tropico 3) would do well to have a look at one or two of the guides available on steam. When I started I found that I was playing as if it was tropico 3 and not really utilising all the buildings and infrastructre very well. Looking at the guides help me understand certain aspects of the game better and also highlight why certain things I tried didnt work etc.\n\nAnyway, I love this game.\n\n10/10","April 7, 2015","true","105.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kreegath/recommended/57690/","Kreegath","Kreegath","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kreegath/","227 products in account","Not having played any other game in the series, getting into Tropico 4 I was afraid of running face first into a learning curve wall, but was pleasantly surprised by the way the game was designed. It's intuitive and does a good job at explaining the core mechanics without holding your hand whilst talking down to you.\n\nWhat I mean is that Tropico 4 is extremely accessible. You almost cannot lose unless you overreach something fierce. Even then, you can tell when things aren't working out, and you're more often than not given time to rectify the situation. The difficulty lies in the unique stipulations and events of each individual scenario, which actually switches the gameplay up to the point where you get to work with all your tools and not just do the same build over and over. I appreciate that, because it's a welcome change of pace from a lot of other strategy games where you just find "the best" way to play and then repeat until the end credits.\n\nThe ambience and tone of the game is spot on for what it goes for, keeping it light and humorous. It's chock-full of caricatured and satirized references to real life leaders and personalities, with plenty of jokes and easter eggs to keeps you entertained even when the gameplay starts getting repetetive and slow.\nGraphically, it's ok without being especially impressive. Thankfully it's not going for impressive, though, but rather functionally, which it is. You can run it on most systems without any problems. Everything's clear and you won't have any problems getting into the mood of the game.\n\nIf you're an achievement hunter looking for another perfect clear, be aware that some of the "harder" achievements are rare because they're incredibly grind-heavy. I got stuck playing the same sandbox map over and over for more than 20 games after having cleared the campaigns, in order to get all character traits to level 5. Took hours and wasn't much fun after a while, although I hadn't maximized my char traits beforehand so some levels had been wasted.\n\nWhen it comes to DLC, I would actually advice against getting "Modern Times", since the buildings you get completely break the game. You will get stuff that just replaces everything you can get in the base game, and all difficulty is thrown out the window. It could be fun for a couple of games or a long sandbox game, but it'll get tired and it'll get tired fast. Just isn't worth it in my opinion.\n\nIn conclusion, I warmly recommend it. Tropico 4 is a game that'll keep you busy for hours on end, and keep you entertained throughout. It's got character, atmosphere and tongue-in-cheek satire. It immerses you in the world of banana republics and continuously challenges you with new and innovative problems. Just don't bother with the "Modern Times" DLC, as it kind of breaks the flow of the game and makes it much too easy and simple. If it's on sale, get it! If it's not, but you like city builder strategy games, why not pick it up?","December 28, 2014","true","115.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game is charming and fun for a little while but the game play gets monotonous rather soon, aspecially in the campaign mood. The constant bossanova music drives me crazy after an hour or so, but I guess that is a matter of taste. The satire is funny now and then, but of a rather expected kind, no real suprises there.\n\nOverall a nice game, but nothing that really nails it for me, and yet worldbuilder games are my cup of tea. If you feel the price is right for you can get it and have a little fun with it, but there are others worldbuilder games that offer more replayability.","May 30","true","19.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The campaign missions provided enough events to hold my attention, aswell as being a reasonable length so I didn't get bored, however after about 15 or so missions I found myself doing the same things over and over when building up the island.\n\nThe major thing holding this game back is the number of buildings you can construct. The island you are given is far too large to accomodate creativitly and diversity in the construction of your buildings, as there is simply not enough buildings to do so. I've only purchased the original game and no DLC, so it may improve with those but I feel like the base game should at least have double the constructable buildings it has.\n\nAll in all, I've found the game fun, and would recommend it if you're a city builder fan.","April 18, 2015","true","32.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The Tropico series for those who haven't played any Tropico games at all is this. You are a Tin Pot Dictator of a small cluster of fictional Islands in the Carribean. You aim is to get rich stuffing as much money as you can into your off shore Swiss Bank Account and try and not get overthrow by the angry factions you have to appease, the people and finally the angry Cold War era Super Powers. Sounds simple right?\n\nBut anyways, Tropico 4 versus 3. The general improvements between the two games don't seem massive to be brutally honest. Some of the problems from 3 are still there (triggering Edicts still has no visual effects apart from your bank balance, same graphics and the same damn music) but 4 brings some improvements to the table. It is clear they learnt something from the DLC and Expansion of Tropico 3 as quite a few features have been ported over to the newer game. I'm sure there is  a huge amount of under the hook tweaks and additions that make it a slightly smoother experince from Tropico 3.\n\nFor one Tropico 4 has a bit more soul and is a lot more amusing. Instead of that single irritating Radio DJ with the same 6 voice clips El Presidente‎ pretty much shares his palace with his aides and faction heads who bring a new feature to the Tropico table with missions that appease your government, the factions or just a slightly easier way to help fill your bank balance or satisfy your people to some extent. And it isn't just your guys the faceless super powers from the first game have been given faces AND both the EU, China and the Middle East have joined in to squabble for your tiny Islands precious resources. This is a pretty good thing as it also gives you a reason to actually play the Main Campaign that has been tweaked a lot around these new additions. They also make sandbox games a slightly less tedious treck.\n\nThere is of course the mandatory couple of new buildings of every type and a couple of new outfits to dress up your Corrupt Carribean Dictator too. And yeah sadly that is it. Of course there is also the suspicious hefty amount of DLC packs with a lot of additional content that should really have been in the game. This game really is more Tropico: The Directors Cut The Electric Phantom Part II than Tropico 4. But hey, they added Twitter with the Facebook Social functions and new achivements if that is your thing!\n\nI sort of wish they made the effort and a DLC that added some new Islands or Music as around the 20 hour mark like with a decent old movie you love to break out every few months to comfort yourself you eventually notice the limited flaws.\n\nSo yeah, final word. Pick it up with all the DLC during a sale if you are a big Tropico/Management game fan or want to try something new.","December 7, 2013","true","55.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The Tropico series for those who haven't played any Tropico games at all is this. You are a Tin Pot Dictator of a small cluster of fictional Islands in the Carribean. You aim is to get rich stuffing as much money as you can into your off shore Swiss Bank Account and try and not get overthrow by the angry factions you have to appease, the people and finally the angry Cold War era Super Powers. Sounds simple right?\n\nBut anyways, Tropico 4 versus 3. The general improvements between the two games don't seem massive to be brutally honest. Some of the problems from 3 are still there (triggering Edicts still has no visual effects apart from your bank balance, same graphics and the same damn music) but 4 brings some improvements to the table. It is clear they learnt something from the DLC and Expansion of Tropico 3 as quite a few features have been ported over to the newer game. I'm sure there is  a huge amount of under the hook tweaks and additions that make it a slightly smoother experince from Tropico 3.\n\nFor one Tropico 4 has a bit more soul and is a lot more amusing. Instead of that single irritating Radio DJ with the same 6 voice clips El Presidente‎ pretty much shares his palace with his aides and faction heads who bring a new feature to the Tropico table with missions that appease your government, the factions or just a slightly easier way to help fill your bank balance or satisfy your people to some extent. And it isn't just your guys the faceless super powers from the first game have been given faces AND both the EU, China and the Middle East have joined in to squabble for your tiny Islands precious resources. This is a pretty good thing as it also gives you a reason to actually play the Main Campaign that has been tweaked a lot around these new additions. They also make sandbox games a slightly less tedious treck.\n\nThere is of course the mandatory couple of new buildings of every type and a couple of new outfits to dress up your Corrupt Carribean Dictator too. And yeah sadly that is it. Of course there is also the suspicious hefty amount of DLC packs with a lot of additional content that should really have been in the game. This game really is more Tropico: The Directors Cut The Electric Phantom Part II than Tropico 4. But hey, they added Twitter with the Facebook Social functions and new achivements if that is your thing!\n\nI sort of wish they made the effort and a DLC that added some new Islands or Music as around the 20 hour mark like with a decent old movie you love to break out every few months to comfort yourself you eventually notice the limited flaws.\n\nSo yeah, final word. Pick it up with all the DLC during a sale if you are a big Tropico/Management game fan or want to try something new.","December 7, 2013","true","55.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The campaign missions provided enough events to hold my attention, aswell as being a reasonable length so I didn't get bored, however after about 15 or so missions I found myself doing the same things over and over when building up the island.\n\nThe major thing holding this game back is the number of buildings you can construct. The island you are given is far too large to accomodate creativitly and diversity in the construction of your buildings, as there is simply not enough buildings to do so. I've only purchased the original game and no DLC, so it may improve with those but I feel like the base game should at least have double the constructable buildings it has.\n\nAll in all, I've found the game fun, and would recommend it if you're a city builder fan.","April 18, 2015","true","32.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Where Tropico 3 had tossed out puns and occasional tongue-in-cheek exclamations over the radio, Tropico 4 has mostly-voiced campaigns, a suite of comedic characters with hilarious interactions, a genuinely funny radio announcement for a lot of the buildings (which does not play as frustratingly frequently as in 3), and a distinct sense of absurdity in the very structure of the campaign. For instance, one of the campaign missions has a series of voice clips which are direct spoofs of "the most interesting man in the world," which left me giggling to myself.","November 1, 2014","true","22.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Don't support bad publisher behavior. Please not that my negative review is not an indictment of the game so much as a warning not to give your money to Kalypso.\n\nI was quite looking forward to playing this game, but after waiting an HOUR to be ALLOWED to, I just don't care anymore. Kalypso requires you to register an account with them in order to play this game. Minor annoyance, right? Except that you need to respond to a verification email after registering before it will let you play. I've been waiting for quite some time now, and no email has come. I can't actually PLAY this game I paid money for. I paid for a splash screen, basically. My logged play time is ALL waiting at the registration screen. That's ridiculous, and Kalypso should be embarrassed.\n\nLook; I understand that sometimes infrastructure slows things down; you're getting a lot of registrations. Here's the thing: I don't care. That's not my problem. You, Kalypso, decided to impliment a half-♥♥♥♥♥ DRM policy for your game. Therefore the honus is on you to make sure your DRM is as non-obstructive as possible.\n\nI really don't even want to play the game at this point. This experience completely soured me on playing the game even if Kalypso does eventually get around to sending me a verification email. I don't want to deal with it anymore. Honestly, Kalypso, this sort of mishandled DRM is what drives people to piracy. Don't worry. I don't pirate games. There are plenty of people who do, though, and I'm willing to bet a cracked copy of your game is MORE functional with LESS hassle than the one I legitimately purchased. That's sad. That's awful. That's a failure on your part, Kalypso, and you have no one to blame but yourself. I will NEVER buy another product from Kalypso Media. I recommend everyone avoid them as well.\n\nADDENDUM: I recieved my registration email at 7:00 a.m. today (August 18th), nearly a full DAY after I bought the game. Because Steam doesn't offer refunds, I'm going to go ahead and try the game out, since I'm out six bucks either way. But my negative review is going to stay here even if the game turns out to be amazing, because people shouldn't have to jump through hoops to assure the publisher that we definitely, DEFINITELY paid for their game; and if there ARE hoops, they should be FUNCTIONAL.","August 17, 2014","false","1.3"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dimedo/recommended/57690/","dimedo","Dimedo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dimedo/","454 products in account","Excellent economics, politics, logistics and overall city building simulation featuring very nicely done funny and overly stereotypical characters.\n\nIt is true that the basic Tropico 4 is just an improved Tropico 3 which even uses the same engine and mostly the same graphical assets. But the additions are improvements in my oppinion and the things added later with the Modern Times DLC make the game very different from its predecessor. I wouldn't recommend any of the other DLCs unless you buy a whole bundle because the one mission and one building they each provide are barely worth one €uro and most of the added buildings are unbalanced in a way so they just make the game a less difficult.\n\nThe simulation is very detailed, so you can actually follow every single person on your island on their daily routes through your cities. Finding out about their needs and their thoughts is actually possible. But most of the times I didn't invest too much time into that and focussed on macro-mechanics. Managing to keep your standings on sane levels with both your factions and foreign powers while at the same time doing what is needed to win the mission can be a hard job sometimes.\n\nAfter a long time of playing and optimizing my strategies, the worst thing I found in the game is a point in each round, where the tension is finally removed because the economy is working well, money is flowing in and the people just love you. There was barely ever a game in which there appeared any new difficulty after that point. If you just consider this situation a win it all becomes less of a problem.\n\nAnother slightly flawed concept seems to be the money in the swiss bank account you can gather through different ways. It makes you have less money available to spend on infrastructure and does not have any other use than improving your game's score. In a future Tropico I hope there is some further use to that. Mechanically sometimes the street building through rocky areas is a bit annoying because you cannot remove the rocks and sometimes need to remove pieces of streets again because there is no angle available anymore to attach a further piece.\n\nAlso a very unneccessary annoyance is the additional Kalypso account you need to register to access the game. One would think that the need to have a logged in Steam account would be enough to verify that you own the game. I hope for their next game they realize that annoying their legal customers is not a good way to counter piracy.\n\nOverall the game gave me more than 120 hours of much appreciated gameplay. I damn well recommend buying this, especially as a complete bundle on sale.","December 31, 2013","true","128.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dimedo/recommended/57690/","dimedo","Dimedo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dimedo/","454 products in account","Excellent economics, politics, logistics and overall city building simulation featuring very nicely done funny and overly stereotypical characters.\n\nIt is true that the basic Tropico 4 is just an improved Tropico 3 which even uses the same engine and mostly the same graphical assets. But the additions are improvements in my oppinion and the things added later with the Modern Times DLC make the game very different from its predecessor. I wouldn't recommend any of the other DLCs unless you buy a whole bundle because the one mission and one building they each provide are barely worth one €uro and most of the added buildings are unbalanced in a way so they just make the game a less difficult.\n\nThe simulation is very detailed, so you can actually follow every single person on your island on their daily routes through your cities. Finding out about their needs and their thoughts is actually possible. But most of the times I didn't invest too much time into that and focussed on macro-mechanics. Managing to keep your standings on sane levels with both your factions and foreign powers while at the same time doing what is needed to win the mission can be a hard job sometimes.\n\nAfter a long time of playing and optimizing my strategies, the worst thing I found in the game is a point in each round, where the tension is finally removed because the economy is working well, money is flowing in and the people just love you. There was barely ever a game in which there appeared any new difficulty after that point. If you just consider this situation a win it all becomes less of a problem.\n\nAnother slightly flawed concept seems to be the money in the swiss bank account you can gather through different ways. It makes you have less money available to spend on infrastructure and does not have any other use than improving your game's score. In a future Tropico I hope there is some further use to that. Mechanically sometimes the street building through rocky areas is a bit annoying because you cannot remove the rocks and sometimes need to remove pieces of streets again because there is no angle available anymore to attach a further piece.\n\nAlso a very unneccessary annoyance is the additional Kalypso account you need to register to access the game. One would think that the need to have a logged in Steam account would be enough to verify that you own the game. I hope for their next game they realize that annoying their legal customers is not a good way to counter piracy.\n\nOverall the game gave me more than 120 hours of much appreciated gameplay. I damn well recommend buying this, especially as a complete bundle on sale.","December 31, 2013","true","128.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Not enough new things happened.\n\nAs a side note, when tornadoes struck it was super annoying. I couldn't find away to turn them off, but you had to sit there and wait for it to finish before you did anything. Also, why do they have to make the female dictators say stupid, sexist crap? All of the females say the same things, which is stuff about getting their nails done or being attractive.

It takes a while to get acclimated to the rules of running your own island (how rent/wages work, etc.), but is a lot of fun once you get a handle on what you're doing.  The campaign is fairly lengthy though I'm not a fan of the timed quests you'll enconter from time to tim.  Luckily, there's a sandbox mode that eliminates the pressures of the campaign.  Whether it be exports or tourism, your main goal is to keep your bank full whilst keeping your Tropicans happy.  Tropico 3 is almost identical in playstyle, so pick that up for cheaper to see if this is something you'd enjoy.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv8dWt9xSZU\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW-rSys5smo\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UBeFA1GSwc","October 9, 2014","true","133.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I've spent nearly 50 hours on it and i'm not even halfway done with the campaign.\n\nIt does get a bit repetitive after 30 hours and you kind of want more buildings and more of everything really. But it's very addictive despite this. There is ofcourse DLC out there to fix this if you want too.\n\nI can highly reccomend Tropico if you have the time for it and like these kinds of games.\n\nI wonder if i will play Tropico5...?","November 24, 2012","true","50.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Choosing for industry is always more profitable than the tourist track.\n-Once you have developed a winning strategy, it's applicable to literally every level.\n-Relatively little variety in the levels and objectives.\n-Game play, especially in the beginning is too slow.
