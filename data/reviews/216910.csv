I was interested a long time in this game, but never felt to buy it - which would have been a huge mistake.\n\nWhen I got thrown in the world of Orcs And Men I felt a little lost.. the controls are very clunky though the tutorials were helping a lot. Anyway the game is basically about a war between Orcs, Goblins, Wizards, Humans and some other races, and you get to play as the main protagonist Arkhail who's a member of the Bloodjaws after leaving his old clan / family (I wont spoil anything important here).  He later on meets the unique Goblin Styx (a lone wolf) who's told to show Arkhail the way to accomplish his mission to make an end to this War.\n\nBut everything gets out of control and the two find themselves in a ~10 hour long Journey full of twists and mixed up game play: Styx -rather small and fast -  is a master of stealth and you got the option to get 1-3 enemies out of the way quietly before entering a fight. Arkhail on the other hand is big and slow but with powerful attacks when things get real.\nSo the game play styles of both together were the best possible combination to me in a game like that... though i preferred to play Styx :3\n\nThe characters of both could not be more different.. Styx is more grumpy and pessimistic / afraid due big challenges while Arkhail is willing to die for his cause / clan in Honor.\nThis gets especially clear during several of the amazing cutscenes and dialogues where you got sometimes the option to chose whether Styx or Arkhail answer / choose their own way (for example: Trust someone or Kill stuff -Arkhail / not trust someone and flee - Styx )\nI loved this game...it lacks in a lot of things because its very very and I mean VERY linear..not much to explore on 1 path besides the main each mission but it fits the game somehow.. I cant even tell why I like it so much - but what I know, is that the music is AWESOME! it changes during calm situations and fights and its just amazing in my opinion x) the setting is beautiful if you don't care too much about graphics - they are nice and enough for a game like that - the atmosphere created is of course subjective but I can recommend most of the time.\n\nTo sum this up.. game play might not be the best but the game plays well, graphics are neither too low nor to high and RPG fans shouldn't bother anyway, Story was interesting though the ending could have been implemented better :D\n\nIf you are a fan of linear RPG's with a rather short but Interesting Story + setting this game might be worth your time if you grab it on a sale for ~ 7 bucks\n\n'Styx: Master of the Shadows' is the Prequel to this game and I'll play it now with a Joy!\nHope you didn't have a hard time reading and the review was helpful :)\nHave a good day folks!","May 26, 2015","true","10.2"," 137 of 145 people (94%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","94","137","145","5","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bobnowhere/recommended/216910/","bobnowhere","bobnowhere","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bobnowhere/","3424 products in account","Of Orcs and Men is third-person action RPG from Cyanide and Spiders, the minds behind Mars: War Logs, Aarklash Legacy, Bound by Flame, Blood Bowl and many others.  The closest analogy in design and mechanics to this game would probably be Mass Effect 1.\n\nTurning the genre on it's head, instead of playing the plucky human fighting evil, you play as a duo of “greenskins”, an enormous Orc name Arkail and a small Goblin named Styx fighting the evil human empire intent on wiping you out.  Both characters, especially Styx, are endlessly entertaining, Styx the comic foil to Arkail's enduring determined colossus.  There is an admirable literary quality here, not just good vs. evil, though the fact that every third line contains the f-word can at times see it return it to baser roots.  Both character can take part in conversations in the now standard “Bioware” dialogue wheel and choosing which character talks can result in wildly varying outcomes.\n\nEach main character has three combat stances, Attack/special/defense for Arkail and Melee/special/ranged for Styx.  Hitting the right shoulder button on the controller allows you to slow time to a crawl and select your various abilities and queue up to 4 at a time on each character.  Both characters have a resource to manage, Styx uses concentration to power his abilities, use it too quickly and he is left with only an auto-attack while it recharges.  Arkail however uses rage.  Use too many offensive attacks too quickly and he can go berserk, doing huge amounts of damage, but becoming more vulnerable to attack and sometimes even killing Styx!  Arkail's defensive stance slows the rage buildup, but he also does less damage.\n\nArkail and Styx are a duo and they function best when they work together.  The best strategy I found was to use Arkail in his defensive stance to group taunt everyone and then stun them while Styx would go around debuffing/poisoning and finishing them off one by one.  As you level up each character gets an additional point that can be used to either buy a new ability or upgrade one with the addition of a choice of effect.  Later in the game each character can choose an “advanced” class adding 3 further abilities to their special stance tree.  There is an impressive number of skills and strategies to use and at higher difficulty levels you will need them!\n\nMaybe the most important strategy is using Styx's stealth ability.  Large groups of enemies can be thinned out before a fight by having Styx go into stealth mode and assassinate enemies at the edges.  But watch out for dogs, they can smell Styx coming!\n\nThe game isn't particularly loot heavy.  While each character has a weapon, gloves, top, pants and accessory slot, there are at most 6 or so different armor sets and weapons for each character in the game.  You are also able to buy an upgrade for each item and you should do this as early as possible.  This is not an easy game and a full set of upgraded gear will provide a noticeable lift in you damage output and survivability.\n\nThe graphics are very decent, though maybe not as sharp as they could be, but the character models of the two mains are fantastic, Styx especially.  The voice acting is patchy, Arkail and Styx are great so are most of the Orc's but some of the humans are pretty average.  The game also has a very nice classical score though at times the mood of the music seemed a little out with what was going on on screen.\n\nWhile not particularly long, 12 hours give or take, the ambition and new experience it offers makes this a very worthy addition to the Action RPG genre and Styx apparently has his own spin-off game coming soon!\n\n8.5/10","June 29, 2014","true","14.6"," 118 of 129 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","118","129","0","0"

The storyline is pretty good, but could have been better. The characters have a lot of potential, but don't really grow as much as they could have. The graphics are excellent, but the facial animation is often off-key. The voice acting is at times very good, and at times not so much.\n\nAll that said, I had good fun with the game.

The main attraction is the story and original setting, playing as orc and goblin against the humain oppression.\n\nPROS\n\n- Overall good story and dialogues\n- Over 16 hours of gameplay if you don't play on easy\n- Overall nice graphics\n\nCONS\n\n- Uninteresting items\n- Average combat system, interesting on paper but should have been better for a game focused on combat like this one\n- Some not too serious technical problems like the camera not cooperating sometimes\n\nREVIEW\n\nThis looked like a barely average game at first. But I was pleasantly surprised. The story is well tied together, the characters are generally well written and well fleshed out, and even the dialogues and exchanges between characters are well done.\n\nThe main downside of this game is that for something so axed on combats, it should have had more items, more skill involved in combat rather than using the mmo system of selecting targets and queuing actions, and the combat itself should have been better tailored to feel more authentic and fast paced. Don't get me wrong, the combat is decent, it just could have been better.\n\nIt also lacks depth in some aspects, like for the character stats for example. There doesn't seem an alternative to putting all points into stamina on orc and all on damage for the goblin, the harder difficulty you go the more obvious it becomes that there is only one viable build.\n\nAll in all I do recommend this game, it is good value if you get it on a sale.","July 3, 2014","true","16.3"," 65 of 71 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","65","71","0","0"

Beyond that not everyone's going to like it.\nBut those of you who will, will be enjoying every moment of the game.\nDeveloper: Cyanide Studio - Spiders Studios\nPublisher: Focus Home Interactive\nRelease Date: 11 October, 2012\n\nDifferent. That’s the word I’d use to describe Of Orcs and Men.\n\nStoryLet’s take a quick look at RPG games in general.\nIf I’d ask you ‘bout the features of a typical RPG game you’d probably start by saying Hero,\nAnd you’d be correct but that on this case. Of Orcs and Men is not a Story about Heroes or the forces of good. I mean, correct me if I’m wrong, but when was the last time an Orc or a Goblin was a Hero? Usually we face them with anger, hatred and their sole purpose is to  make us feel heroic by slaughtering them. Not to mention they’re stupid, dumb and lack general intelligence. Not in most case but usually they’re just stupid.\n\nNot in this case. While I’m not going ahead to say our two, let’s just go ahead and call em Heroes for the sake of RPGs, are real Einsteins or whatnot but they’re certainly examples which happened to grow on me. Especially Styx.\n\nLet me introduce you our two Heroes. In the red corner we have a Arkail. A member of the Blood Jaws. A Rebel if you want to call him that. You might be wondering why so let me explain.\n\nThe Story in this game is unlike others. Usually you’re one of the good races and you have to stop the Orcs from ravaging the lands and slaughter your Wife and unborn Child. That’s how the Story involving Orcs usually goes.\n\nIn Of Orcs and Men you seek revenge. A tyrannical human empire is the ruler of all and thus our beloved Greenskins, as they’re called, are now being persecuted and enslaved and it’s up to Arkail, an Orc which I’d describe as the Hulk of all Orcs, and his companion Styx, a Goblin. Their goal is free the Greenskins by assassinating the human emperor.\n\nSo you see it’s a different concept. Which, personally, I happened to like.\n\nCharactersI talked a bit ‘bout Arkail so let’s talk about Styx. Well Styx’s one of a kind. Besides him, no one has ever seen any Goblin speak or shown any signs of intelligence. So he’s one of a kind.\nWhile Arkail is the muscle, Styx would be best to described as the brain. To an extent.\nWhat that means is, while Arkail wants to let his rage free way, and literally become the Hulk and kill everything he lays eyes upon, that also includes Styx, our one of a kind Goblin on the other hand rather relies on his way of handling things: Stealth and Assassination.\n\nGameplayYou control Arkail and Styx on the click of a button. Both have two stances, so two ways of attacking. Arkail has an offensive stance, which of course, has damage oriented skills and the defensive stance and skill sets. I talked ‘bout Arkail being the Hulkbefore so let’s talk about that. He has a Rage mechanic. What that means is that there’ll be rage building up and once he has build up the rage he will target any enemy he sees and becomes uncontrollable. That also includes Styx. So beware. Once he’s in his rage you’re best bet is to get some distance between those two or else Styx will get downed rather quick.\n\nStyx on the other hand is your typical thief with hand-to-hand, dagger, combat skills and a ranged set where he relies on throwing knifes. Beyond that he can enter stealth stance so he’s able to pick off unaware enemies and even the odds.\n\nThey both can also work together so Arkail can throw Styx, for example, on enemies or Styx can pass Arkail a bottle which boosts his health regeneration in battle.\n\nAtmosphereExcuse me for the following:\nOf Orcs and Men seems to be one ♥♥♥♥ing good game where the ♥♥♥♥ing characters talk like ♥♥♥♥ing drunken sailors.\n\nWell the game’s not afraid to use adult language. To be quite honest, while it might be not for everyone, I do believe it fits the game perfectly. Keep in mind we’re ♥♥♥♥ing talking ‘bout a ♥♥♥♥ing big ol’ green Orc and a ♥♥♥♥ing lil’ Goblin.\n\nThe voice acting of the key characters is quite good but … everyone else seems to be lacking some effort.\n\nDifficultySo here’s the thing. The game has four difficulties. Personally I’ve been playing on Extreme from the get go, since I always enjoy playing on the hardest difficulty first, and let me tell you this.\nThis game is hard. Not even kidding. So I can only imagine how easy it’d be on a lower difficulty.\nSo that could be a reason why a lot of people don’t enjoy the game. It does have a learning curve and, despite playing two usually dumb and stupid characters, you’ve to think ‘bout how you want to approach the situation.\n\nWhat else can I ♥♥♥♥ing say?The game is for a specific crowd. Let’s start by saying this. It’s certainly not for everybody but for those of you who’re interested in the game and for those of you who’re not afraid of a real challenging game … It’ll grow on you. I certainly enjoy it. Special thanks to the dialogues I certainly enjoyed those.\nI'd really say you should give this game a try. It's certainly not bad. It's just something else.","June 8, 2015","true","6.7"," 53 of 66 people (80%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","80","53","66","4","4"

There are obvious things that sully the experience a bit, but given this is the effort of small studio on a tight budget these aren't hard to look past.\n\nThe story takes a twist on typical fantasy by having orcs being oppressed and subjegated by humans, and in light of this, your main character is on a quest to kill the emperor who seeks to unite elves and dwarves against "the greenskins."\n\nThe main character is Arkail, or the "butcher" as he has been dubbed after a bloody masacre in his past. What's great here is that this story element actually works into the gameplay. As you take damage your rage meter builds, and if you don't use skills to keep your calm he becomes enraged. In this state, he more powerful but reckless and uncontrollable, attacking foes in random order.\n\nEvening this out is his original odd couple partner in crime, Styx. He is a goblin assassin, the only one of his race who can speak or display any intelligence at all. He causes bleeds, poisons and lowers defense in combat, and out of combat he small stealth sections where he dispatches as many soldiers as he can before things eventually fall to pieces.\n\nThe story is well surprisingly well written considering every other line of dialogue has a swear word, because it fits into the narrative and general feeling of the story. I was honestly surprized at myself when I started the characters, admiring the way the duo chirped eachother and eventually grew into a like-minded friendship. Combat slows down when you pause so you can plan each of their actions, and everything works quite well. The graphics are nice enough and the game has a surprizingly good soundtrack that hits all the right notes when a sad or intense situation takes rise.\n\nSadly, there are some issues, though they are just a lot of nitpicks that don't effect the solid feel of gameplay. Character models don't sync up in most cutscenes, a weapon constantly floats in air against Ark's back, voice acting apart from the main duo is largely sub-par. You are told of great battles going on in other places due to what's happening in the story and can't be there because the game's budget wouldn't allow it, and some people might not like how the stealth sections work. You essentially sneak around and kill guards in order of which would be able to see the act from their FOV, the ai will walk past dead bodies without raising alarm which seems silly but is also necessary to that element of gameplay. This is a stop motion turn based rpg first, the stealth is more like a small minigame that you are never actually forced to do that makes fights easier.\n\nPast that, there are a bunch of sidequests which never feel pointless as the duo banter and you find out more meaningful things about the story. I'm not usually someone who likes sidequests but it worked well for me. You have a mission hub in different zones and when you pick a mission it is generally linear except for a few hidden treasures. There's a couple of choices to be made in the game that have small outcomes on story, but nothing with permanance.\n\n\nAll and all, the flaws take you out of the experience in a small fathom but do little to stop this extremely charming game from taking your heart. The prequel, Styx:Master of shadows is out soon, and I can't wait to delve again into this world again, and see how much the studio has grown since their time between the titles.\n\n9/10   There's nitpicks, but the story, the gameplay and the pacing are all great and a low budget doesn't change that.\n\nEdit: Fixed a couple errors, special thanks to Snapfit for calling me out on goofing the main character's name and thanks for all the positive feedback on my review.","September 30, 2014","true","11.9"," 46 of 56 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","46","56","2","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/216910/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3342 products in account","The fantasy world earns yet another entry with Focus Home Interactive's Of Orcs and Men, a story of resolve, tolerance, and genocide. Here, humans vie for power at the cost of content tribal cultures to the south. Players take control of a two-person party in which they can focus on stealth and ranged combat or tanky, melee combat.Of Orcs and Men follows Arkail, a short-tempered orc fighter suffering from PTSD, and Styx, the only speaking goblin anyone's ever found. The nefarious humans have decided that their lands simply weren't expansive enough, so they've begun an onslaught on the orc lands. Arkail's chief has entrusted him and a few others with launching covert missions to assassinate the emperor before he enlists the help of the dwarves and elves. A proud and dutiful orc, Arkail sets forth to complete his mission. Along the way, he encounters Styx, a sly goblin who has been paid to guide Arkail on his path.Styx and Arkail appear to be polar opposites at the onset of the story – Styx works for money and has a way with words, while Arkail's principles and loyalty are matched only by his uncontrollable rage. The mature script communicates realistically and tastefully. Our protagonists, despite their differences, work well off of each other, both in how they meet their goals and in how they interact.This third-person action RPG, as stated earlier, follows our two "greenskins" around narrow corridors, even if the environment calls for spacious arenas. Players can freely switch between the two, though many may find themselves sticking with Styx, since he can stealthily assassinate loitering soldiers and inquisitors using his sneak ability. In this way, many battles can seem like puzzles: how can I optimize my killing potential in order to do less actual fighting?If and when combat begins, the wrecking ball Arkail can choose offensive, defensive, or special abilities. Primarily a melee fighter, Arkail has a rage bar that fills up over time, and if it reaches its threshold, he enters a chaotic mode in which anyone and everyone in his path will be pulverized over the duration of his now-decreasing rage bar – including Styx. Don't get too excited, because special abilities are quite limited, with a few interesting choices that are only unlocked right before the end of the game.Alternatively, offensive and defensive abilities offer a diverse toolbox with which to stab and bash opponents. Upon leveling, new skills can be unlocked, and old ones can be upgraded. When upgrading, two choices are available, and players can only pick one permanently.During almost the entire game, players will find themselves running through long, beautiful caverns or halls for twenty seconds or so, notice that the game is quick saving, and then hit stealth mode to murder a couple of the languid foes ahead. Repeat. Unfortunately, customization is a one-time deal in that most situations can be resolved in much the same way. Thus, much of the game feels like going through the motions, and I could never sit through it for more than a couple hours at a time.That said, Of Orcs and Men at least keeps its environments visually stimulating with countless details and extraordinary graphics. Never before have I been so intrigued by the intricate details on a character's skin. The textures on Arkail's body demand inspection at first, with each dimple, curve, and scar reflecting perfectly in all sorts of lighting with myriad shades. Similarly, leather looks like the real deal with its waxy surface and creases.Since the game follows Arkail and Styx throughout, one might expect expert voice acting from our heroes. Non-playable characters' voice actors, however, are not always up to the task. While I believed almost every word that came out of our orcish allies, I occasionally raised an eyebrow when a sidequestrian spoke. Combat never missed a beat with typical metal-against-metal and piercing sounds maintaining the bubble of immersion. Musically, the use of violins was a welcome change from the standard horn affair one expects from this sort of game.In terms of control, glitchy camera issues reared their head when players chose to fight against a wall. Targeting was a chore as well, since battles could include nearly twenty enemies if players aren't savvy enough with assassination.Of Orcs and Men feels like a missed opportunity. Action RPGs tend to be gameplay-driven rather than story-driven, and this game is no exception. All of the trappings are there: visuals, voice acting, script, likable characters, and novel game design ideas. However, the game falters in its execution of those ideas, and one misstep can mean tumbling down a tall tower. Fortunately, like our stalwart heroes, such a long, hard fall doesn't obliterate the game.","February 27, 2015","true","68.4"," 39 of 47 people (83%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","83","39","47","3","0"

'Of Orcs and Men' does what other titles in the genre fail to achieve: it makes you see what it's like to be a hulking beast of rage and muscle. As the warrior Arkail, one of the main gameplay mechanics is to manage your bloodlust - if you let it get the better of you, Arkail will go on a blind, murderous rampage. While he amps up his damage this way, you can only watch on helplessly as he makes poor tactical decisions, exposes himself needlessly to enemy fire, and even turns on his constant Goblin ally (who you also control). Built around this unique idea is a rich story adhering to a fitting theme - that of Orcs being enslaved as beasts of burden by human masters.\n\nThe combat is handled by queueing up your next attacks, reminiscent of the system from Knights of the Old Republic. This may push the patience of those wanting more immediate and visceral action, but it works well enough to get you through the entire adventure. With sharp writing and characters you grow attached to, this is a unique experience that deserves a lot more attention than it received.

No complaints about the graphics, writing, or voice acting for the most part. Styx is probably the best character I've seen in a long while.\n\nOnly thing that really felt wrong about the game are its dead environments.

Worth around $22-25. Got 14 hours out of it, 75/80% off all achievments, could get I guess around 20 if I tried to beat the game on highest difficulty.\n\nStory: The world was interesting, and the main characters were too. Their personalities played off each other well, and had me in stiches the whole time. Unfortunatly, the side characters and villians were pretty much 1-dimension. It was hard to be attached to them, or be even interested in them.\n\nWorld:\nInteresting, but nothing special or awestrucking. Seems to be semi-linear, but if you look at all the maps carfeully, there's like 8 versions of linear paths, just angled differently or starting in different areas, thus making it really really liner. If you don't analyze maps alot, then it's semi linear for you. Occasionally some invisble walls in the enviroment, that were probably accidently left in the game, because they're as thin as a pencil. Annoying in combat, but rare. Occured 5 times.\n\nUser Interface:\nBasic, which first seemed worrysome. Later on, I realized this made the gameplay easier, as meant less time spent on micromanaging, and nothing to slowdown the game speed. Helped by making only one, basic currency. Trade points. Ex: 2 points for a sword at most, 1 point to upgrade, one point gained to sell it back.\n\nGraphics:\nMostly good, for a 2012 game. Occasionly some hiccups, nothing to worry.\n\nAudio:\nUsually the most underrated part of a game. The voices sounded crisp, no hiccups. They put alot of effort in the quality of music. Some of it is memorable, and fitted well with the enviroment/combat. Lip synce issues were annoying at first, but you eventually ignored it. Later on in the game, it smoothes itself out.\n\nCombat:\nA basic version of Dragon Age 1's combat system. Some options of equipment, but not much. The main characters combat roles play off each other well, with the Orc being a tank/bezerker and the Goblin being a rogue/assassin. Whenever you only had the chance to play one in a combat setting, you're made to realize that they need each other, and can't function well alone. Most be a good message hidden there.\n\nThis games need a sequel.

Being always the evil force in games? Well dont know about you but I do,thats for sure. And OOAM let me kill humans now... how refreshing .\n\nStory,Quests and Levels\n\nYou are Arkail,fearsome orc,who is apointed with the assassination of the Emperor. In your journey you will be lead by Styx,master of stealth and assassination. Story is linear with here and there some decision making. At 2-3 points you will end up in hub-like area from which you can get different side quests to complete and improve yourself. The levels you will find are linear,each of them separated in "zones" .  There isnt much of exploration which can be bad or good depending on the player.\n\nRPG elements\n\nWell you can equip your characters with some items and pick skills everytime they level up. Later in the game you are given 2 options per character to specialize them. Nothing to deep. Its simple but its doing its job in the game.\n\nCombat\n\nCombat is in 2 phases(or if you are good enough you can pick just one of them):\n1st. Stealth: you put Arkail in some spots save and use Styx to wonder around and kill guards without being seen. It takes time but make Phase 2 much easier... talking about phase 2.\n2.Once detected every guard from the "zone" will charge at you and fun time starts. Combat is action-based,there isnt pause button to set a lineup of skills for the orc and goblin to use. Instead you are given slow-motion button so you have to be fast with selecting targets and skills.  Combat needs sometime to get used to it. One thing that you should have in mind, Arkail got a berserk stance, while he do and takes dmg berserk fills and once full he goes all nuts,take less dmg,deals more dmg and attacks everything that moves... even Styx so run for the hills if this happens.\n\nReplayability\n\nOnly reason to replay the game is to pick different decisions at places but for most people even one playthrough will be good enough.\n\nOverall\nA nice and solid RPG with interesting combat and story to tell.","April 2, 2015","true","20.3"," 23 of 30 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","23","30","0","0"

The story was captivating, the music gave me chills, the combat, well, I would describe it as the thinking mans dragon age. It obviously had flaws, the biggest was that there was too little of everything. I finished it in about 13 hours and am left dreaming of a sequel.\n\nI noticed this game just around the time it came out, but  waited with a buy until it was discounted and sat on it for even longer as I had read so much negative feedback beforehand. I wish I could go back in time, buy it at release to support the studio, and get on the barricades to defend it against all the flaming. I can understand a lot of the critisicm, however I think it all boils down to this game being unaccessable to a lot of people due to the challenge of the combat system, and the game being marketed in a way that perhaps fooled people it was a more action-oriented game with a bigger budget. The trailer kind of looked like gears of war with orcs, to be honest.\n\nI could write a lot about this game but will just summarize the main points;\nI enjoyed the combat, allthough a little unforgiving at some points, it did let me think up different tactics for different battles. The skills were fun and there were a few easier patches that let you feel powerful. Gear managment was a little thin but worked okay. Leveling your characters was business as usual with stat and skill points, with some new intresting bits such as deflection and stability. The game looks and plays beautifully. Encountered only a few minor glitches (perhaps it has been patched a bit?). Voice acting quality varied throughout the game from excellent (main characters) to crappy, but I only disliked a few of the actors.\n\nThe bad? "Corridor running" which I did not really mind, as I enjoyed the combat and the quests.\nSlow paced combat, so be prepared if you don´t like that sort of thing. Lack of in-game cinematics or at least more cinematic finishes to some of the more epic events, which left some anti-climatic feelings at parts. And in the end, a lack of budget? If there would have been some more time and resources to flesh more stuff out, this could have been a dragon age killing tripple A.\n\nI can´t help but picturing a sequel of magnitude, with deeper tactical combat, different character choices, a more open world with continuation of the story.\n\nIf you enjoy tactical RPG´s - a must play, if you came here looking for an action game, you should probably head back.\nAs for me?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/leovic/recommended/216910/","leovic","leovic","http://steamcommunity.com/id/leovic/","237 products in account","A nice solid RPG framework for a potentially great franchise.\nNow, the small scope makes me think of this game as sort of like a B-list movie. That's not a bad thing actually. It's almost like an indie RPG but it's definitely not since they've got big Publisher support. It makes the game feel well rounded and solid. The devs knew what they wanted to make and they did so splendidly. It's a budget title so to speak.\n\nThe game uses my favorite combat style of queuing up actions and attacks either in real-time or in paused time (but in this game's case - slowed time) much like Knights of the Old Republic or Neverwinter Nights. And the combat is fantastic by the way. It's definitely challenging since every attack is deliberate and damaging to both your characters and the enemies. What I mean by that is the enemies usually come in packs and can easily interrupt, stun, and then kill your party if your not careful. The levels actually reinforce the idea of planning. The levels are mostly straight corridors that are dotted with wide open arenas. You can approach them stealthly or guns blazing.\n\nNow, I should mention that you've only got two playable characters, Arkail the big orc and Styx the obviously rogue goblin. The customization is kind of limited. The game's got small skill trees, obvious shiny loot sacks, and (to the devs credit) upgradeable gear. It's obvious that your party is going to turn out with the orc as your tank and the goblin is either your range or melee DPS. But an interesting thing about the orc is you can lose control of him since he has a rage meter. The rage meter also acts as the orc's "mana" to activate certain skills though. So you can imagine how your going to plan out your fights with that in mind.\n\nTheir story and that of the game's story is actually your typical fantasy. You got your orcs, goblins, mages, fanatical religious orders, and later on a brief appearance by the Elves and Dwarves. Basically, the story is that the orcs are being enslaved by a cruel human empire. Your story is to lead Arkail and Styx on a suicide mission to kill the human emperor. It's a nice story and the world is really interesting. It's got this typical western european medieval look to it. But the Orcish perspective help in sucking me in to the game's world. However, the dialogue and the voice acting is pretty bad. The swearing is so out of place. It's like the devs were trying to be edgy but just failed with the translation from the original french script. There is a dialogue system. But it's there to either get more lore to choose which side quest to take.\n\nThe graphical fidelity is also pretty great. The character models of the orcs & goblins plus the later levels look stunning especially with an obvious budget title. And the soundtrack is also great. I would definitely buy it.\n\nAll-in-all, the game's a fairly decent RPG from two studios who would later on make some fairly decent RPG's with the same combat system. I love the combat and the Orcish perspective on a typical fantasy world is refreshing experience. And if your aching for a solid and almost indie like RPG, then buy this game. If your on the fence, then buying at a discount is always a good idea.\n\nPC Port NOTES: It ran well on my amd fx 6 core and amd hd7850 on max settings with little to no performance hiccups and a steady 60 fps. Nothing game breaking here. Hell, alt+tab even works (no borderless windowed mode though). The devs also later on removed some horrible DRM. Also, the game does have some decent graphical options. Another thing is that mouse and keyboard is playable but the keys are non-rebindable.","December 20, 2013","true","16.1"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","12","15","0","0"

On the positive side: an interesting and engaging story, some parts of the graphics are rather well done, the faces for example, good voice acting, good music and a fighting system which is often fun. In many parts of the game this is an enjoyable mix of stealth and direct action. But the game design is so peculiar, that I can only imagine that the maker of the game had only a rather short design document like this: "Itemization (is overated anyway): not too much and let's put the best stuff in the first level, then choosing armor and weapon is done and out of the way. Level design: there is a beginning and an end and a tube between them; if this isn't interesting, the graphic designer has  f**ked up. Tactical freedom: who has time for this nonsense, if the player dies he knows he hasn't yet found the way how I think he should do this level. And people who want a choice can always choose the character they play with. Character development: It's a rpg. Have you never played a rpg? Right! There you go. But let's get creative: Let's add some really cool abilities at the end of the game and let the player decide which group of abilities he chooses, but - here is the trick - without telling him what the choice are. Cool, right? And ... but that should be enough to get you going and I have to go down to the beach.

It's been a while since I have felt I've really wasted my money like this. I've tried to be so good with this stuff, but god dammit it's *UPSETTING* me off that I could have given that $7 to another developer and actually enjoyed a game.\n\nI honest to god really enjoyed the Game of Thrones rpg by the guys at Cyanide, so the thought of similar combat didn't bother me at all, and the premise of Orcs&Men seemed pretty interesting. I also figured since it was the same engine at least the gameplay would be cool if at times the writing went Eastern European on me.\n\nWell, the writing is stilted and thoroughly subpar, in terms of horrible, horrible non-stop expository dialog, singularly zero-dimensional characters, and completely uninteresting quest progression/design.\n\nCharacter development is 'deep' in the sense of there are several different options at any given time, but *I'LL BE DARNED* me if they're all pretty much leading to the same style of play. It all *I'LL BE GOSH DARNED* sucks.\n\nThe combat feels really worse than GoT. I'm not sure why. It's very unresponsive and clunky. It could also be the design of the encounters that contributes, which really are utter *VERY BAD*. The level environment layout is literally on rails - a two-lane MOBA level at the best of times. It's a foockin' ginny-bandersnatch.\n\nYou 'stealth' your way around to silently kill an enemy or two and then the others notice you and all run at you - at which point strategy devolves into swatting at a cloud of flies. There is 'strategy' involved I guess because I have the option of throwing daggers from a distance and my other dude fighting close-up, which sucks, or having both my dudes fight in-your-face style, which also is incredibly boring.\n\nIn summary, the game's *VERY BAD*. I'm a little frustrated and feel like I wasted my money.

It bears both highs and lows of Game of Thrones RPG, but I would say it it adds some of its own to the mix with highly subjective results.\n\nFirst thing first – this probably won't be everyone's cup of tea based purely on shoddy craftsmanship, which is quite obviously the result of a limited budget and lack of polish in practically every department of the game. That's not to say everything can be attributed to higher force, though. Game's level design is very linear on purpose and takes a good long while before it breaks the monotony of uninspired grimy streets, not to mention stealth which I'll touch upon later, simply doesn't have even half-decent enemy AI to counter it so your would-be victims simply stroll past their comrades' corpses without batting an eyelid as you stalk about in binary ON/OFF stealth biding your time. This leads me to....\n\nReasons why you may love and/or hate Of Orcs and Men. This game speaks to me on some level I didn't even know I had a preference for. Yes, it's incredibly rough around the edges with some questionable design choices. Yes, it has some serious difficulty spikes here and there that almost lead me to take a break out of sheer frustration. But standing on top of all of that I still think it's a very good game if you work with it and can overlook relatively minor issues. Why? Because it handles the concept of "risk vs reward" extremely well and makes it an integral part of the game. What this translates to in practice is Arkail's rage and Styx's stealthing about, both of which are absolutely required to get anything done. To tie that into calculated risk thing I mentioned earlier: you will need Arkail's rage ability, but because it's a double-edged sword during which he may attack Styx as well as enemies and because it builds up no matter what AND takes control away from you until it's run its course leaving Arkail stunned for a while, you will need to go through fights methodically waiting to pick the perfect moment when to go nuts for maximum effect. On the hand Styx's stealth will be responsible for leveling the playing field by taking out enemies before you engage in open combat and it's just as mandatory as the above because the odds are always against you. And to top it all off you will need to learn the game's somewhat obtuse real-time with slow-motion command input combat system real fast because Of Orcs and Men does not hold back any punches.\n\nStory-wise the game manages to play with your expectations, miss some beats it really should've hit perfectly but didn't for some reason and do some things I really, really like. It becomes obvious very early on our two characters aren't really heroes and barely even qualify as anti-heroes purely in contrast because they're facing opposition which is generally even worse. Arkail's rage is not only a gameplay mechanic, but also a story element which plays a sizable role in who he is as a person and you will get some unexpected story revelations about Styx as you go along, but the world these two inhabit is truly crapsack where swearing like a drunken sailor is the norm and gets worse by the day, only for story to raise questions about whether your actions will make it any better in the end and for who. I'd say pacing is a bit weak early on and may make you think you're wasting your time because it takes couple of hours until you get a proper grip on things, both with story and gameplay, but then picks up and actually feels rushed in the last quarter or so where it could've used some more time to mull over things and put an actual challenging final boss which was a disappointment compared to some fights you’ve been through.\n\nIn the end, and because I've worn my keyboard out at this point meandering over what is essentially "Do you like getting your ♥♥♥ handed to you until you learn how to hand it back?", I leave you with these two timeless words of wisdom: psychic ♥♥♥♥.","February 13, 2015","true","12.9"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","3"

Let's ship it"?!\n\nThe combat system works like this, LB and RB each bring up a radial menu with either offensive or defensive attacks. Key phrase there; "defensive attacks". Even your defence is just a slightly quicker offence. There doesn't seem to be a way to block or dodge anything. It works by giving the two characters orders like a turn-based strategy game but in realtime. Well it slows down time when you open the attack menus but you have so little control over the characters actions during a fight. It clearly should've been a hack'n'slash affair. Everything else about it was alright.\n\nI've played this for about two hours, a bit of it was offline. I've also played Styx and that had some issues with combat but by God it's infinitely better than this.","April 29","false","0.6"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","9","12","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/POfilelink/recommended/216910/","POfilelink","Po라고 불러주세요","http://steamcommunity.com/id/POfilelink/","341 products in account","Of Orcs and Men\n8/10\n\nTl;Dr: Definitely buy the game if it goes on sale but only buy it at full price if you are absolutely dying for a good ARPG\n\nI had gotten this game from a friend who had bought the Killer Bundle 3 and he did not want it . He asked me if I was interested in it and upon researching the game I figured I would add the game to my library, download it, and play it at a later time.\n\nI decided to check out the game when my internet went down and was pleasantly surprised by it.\n\n\nGraphics 8/10\n\nThe game is very cinematic graphics wise. You can see that the devs tried very hard to show you a movie story through the cutscenes. The textures are very nice in this game. The skin on the orcs look somewhat realistic and you can see the lighting bounce off it. I personally find it very nice when you can see sunlight bouncing off a character's skin in any game. The rain effects look amazing and it looks as though things are actually getting wet. However, the characters do look a bit stiff sometimes. Lastly, when the characters speak (in the cutscenes) they get a bad case of the rubberlips (notorious in Warcraft 3 where characters' lips would just bounce up and down when speaking)\n\nAudio  6/10\n\nThe music is generic adventure game-like. It's something you would hear and say "Ah, that would sound nice in an action adventure game"\n\nThe voiceovers are decent. The best voice actor is the one who voices Styx the Goblin. His character brings a roguelike charm with his monologues and witty lines.\n\nThe biggest issue I had with the audio was the mouth synchronization. You are able to hear when the dialogue starts and ends suddenly.\n\nGameplay   9/10\n\nThis is where the game really shines. Before playing the game I assumed that it would be a hack and slash action game. The game actually plays like an ARPG (Action Role Playing Game). Upon entering the game I masked my left key hoping that the character would swing his sword around. However upon playing the first 10 minutes of the story (which serves as the tutorial) I found myself slowly understanding how the game works.\n\nThe combat system is similar to Dragon Age Origins (or almost any ARPG) in that you can use the spacebar to pause the game and plan your next few moves. Pressing the spacebar also brings up your combat hud. There you can plan up to five of your next moves. Pressing spacebar again will unpause time and your character will do the attacks in the cache.\n\nThe level system is fairly simple. There are five attributes that you can put points in. Strength, Agility, Stamina, and Mind. Each attribute has different helpful upgrades. You can also upgrade/unlock new abilities.\n\nYou control two character in Of Orcs and Men. Arkail and Styx. While Arkail excels at fighting and tanking damage, Styx has a more stealth/assassin fighting style. Each character has a one unique mechanic. Arkail has a rage system, where if his rage bar fills (by attacking and using special abilities) he becomes uncontrollable and will just pummel at the enemy. Styx can become invisible and will 1 hit kill his next backstab target.\n\nThe hud is simple yet visually pleasing.\n\nThe one problem the gameplay has is that the targetting system for attacking feels a bit clunky. Sometimes it feels like your character got confused and doesn't know who to hit.\n\nStory  6/10\n\nThe story is quite simple and might seem a bit cliche.\n\nHumans have enslaved the Orcs and forces them to work as slaves and cannon fodder. However, there is a group of free Orcs that are resisting the humans and are going to take a last stand. It's up to Arkail and his shifty goblin guide to take down the king and free the Orcs.\n\nThe game offers some dialogue choices but so far none of them really make any changes to the story.\n\nI love the duo dynamic that exists between Arkail and Styx. They both hate each other when they first meet but grow to respect and even rely on each other.\n\nThere are some iffy parts in the script though. I've noticed that the characters love to say "♥♥♥♥" at inappropriate times (inappropriate as in it doesn't really need to be said in the context). Also it seems like the devs/writers/animators tried to give Arkail a signature move/trait (he punches his fists a LOT whenever a cutscene with him ends) but it just ends up feeling very awkward.\n\nI was surprised when I first saw Styx in this game because he actually stars in his own game Styx: Master of Shadows, a stealth game about... well, Styx. When Styx: MaS first came out I was very interested because many people said that it was a Stealth game done right. Upon research, I now know that it is a prequel to Of Orcs and Men.\n\nFinal say\n\nOverall, I found myself enjoying the game and would definitely have bought it had I known about it. Again, I highly recommend buying it if it ever goes on sale but wait a bit if not. The gameplay is the best part of the game and the graphics are a close second.\n\nThis is my first review so please tell me how I can improve and what you liked about the review on my Steam Page. Thank you for reading and it was a fun time playing Of Orcs and Men.\n","May 14, 2015","true","1.5"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","3"

For each of your two characters you assign a list of actions they will execute in order, which allows for the near simulataneous control of your orc and goblin, but robs you of the fluidity that is normally present in comparable games. I never got the sense that success or failure in combat was at all connected with my level of skill or understanding of the game. I clicked the 'attack' button and the orc attacked. I didn't feel in control of my own characters.\n\nThe constant interuptions, especially in the beginning, do a lot to slow down the pace of the game and make you feel less like you a playing an RPG and more like you are watching a CGI movie. Each time you go around a corner the camera pans to show you where a group of guards is standing or draw you into dialogue with a character that you don't want to interact with.\n\nEven some of the dialogue choices you are given are largely irrelevant as option A will lead you to fight a person now, while option B will have to fighting the exact same person 90 seconds later. It is common for this genre to not include these choices. No Zelda game ever let you choose if you wanted to fight Ganon or not, and that is perfectly fine, but if we will have choices make them real choices that have different outcomes. If the developers wanted to make a precisely scripted game without minor plot variations then why let players choose their dialogue response at all?\n\nI was honestly looking forward to playing this game, but quickly became frustrated by these annoyances that detract from the emersion experience. If these traits don't sound like they would bother you then perhaps you will enjoy this game more than I did.","July 23, 2014","false","3.7"," 12 of 20 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","12","20","0","0"

The game is well balanced, the story is quite interesting and the gameplay was fun.\n\nI'm afraid many people review this game negatively because they were expecting a real time action game, but as I mentioned, it's more of a Dragon Age Origins style of combat. Graphically speaking the game is not stunning, but it looks nice and the map surroundings are interesting and do not become repetitive or boring. It's a linear game though, so don't expect anything else. However, it also rewards you for exploring and for carefully planning the roles of your fighters, Arkail and Stinx, each with their own mechanics and perks. These characters have well developed personalities and backgrounds and it's a lot of fun seeing them interact with each other. I liked that for once the humans were not the good guys, but the enemy, making us see the now classic conflict from a different perspective.\n\nI really enjoyed the game so I definitely recommend it to anyone interested in this kind of game, as long as they understand that they are not buying a real time action game.

The art is good, the characters too (playing an orc and a goblin in an RPG with humans as enemies is really refreshing), the story is average but the characters are interesting. However, this game has one serious flaw : frustration.\n\nFirst, all map are linear. More linear than Skyrim's dungeons. More linear than FFXIII's. And all optionnal quests' maps are designed the same way : a linear corridor with 3 battles. Ok, optionnal quests are, you guessed it, optionnal. But in difficulty 3 out of 4, you have to do thoses quests to level up.\n\nThe battle system is really frustrating. At least in difficulty 3 out of 4 (thus, 4 too, and maybe 2). Especially for those who want a little RP and want a badass orc without hacking through the levels in a too easy difficulty.\nFirst, your orc is weak. Well, he's stronger than the average enemy, but I was shocked how quickly he can fall, even in defensive mod. For most battles, you want him in full tank/defensive mode while the little goblin does all the dps...\nSo much epicness is lost here. It would have been better to have the goblin in full status inflicting/assassin role. But no, he will often deal most of the dps...\nThe rage thing is probably the most frustrating for RP players like me. IF Arkain becomes enrage too early, the battle is probably lost. The only moment when the rage is handy, is when there are only one or two enemies left with little HP, and Arkain can benefit from the extra health he gains when he becomes enraged.\nSo, basically, either the rate comes too early and you lose, either it comes too late and you lack the epicness, either it comes in a stupidly easy fight you would have won without touching your controller/keyboard anyway...\nWhy play an orc if you can't go full berserk more often ? Why can't they be a little more useful ?\n\nFor the battles, the orc is slow. Ok, it's an orc. The muscular beast who hits hard but is slow. However, his attacks can be cancelled by the enemies a bit too easily. And by "a bit", I mean "a lot". In the early game, trying to stun an opponent fails 3 times out of 4. And the stun time is so short you'll regret trying to stun them. Other skills are so long (because the orc hits multiple times in the same skill), you lose time because he hits the ground after he killed his target... while other enemies are still hitting him in melee range.\n\nThose may seems like little details for you. If it is, well, buy the game. I think I said the main problems I encountered with this game. But for those who wanted to play a badass orc, either don't buy it or play in easy difficulty (with all the boredom it may imply).","September 7, 2015","false","5.9"," 22 of 41 people (54%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","54","22","41","2","0"

Pretty much since group 1 until last group you do almost literally the same thing.\n2. story is interresting, but spread out so thin, however I liked the whole lore spinoff of this fantasy world.\n3. gameplay design is borderline insane. 99% of game counts with 2 character combo, with Arkhail as tanky dude, and Styx as killing glasscanon. But several times, especially in the end, the game splits and allows only one. I literally couldn't finish the sections and move on, even on normal difficulty. Who told the devs it's a good idea should be fired from further level design. My orc doesn't do any damage and my goblin doesn't survive more than 4 hits. It is ridiculous.\n4. pacing of the game is completely off, it appears like a huge game, first chapter takes hours, plethora of them, but chapter 3 and 4 together takes barely an hour, it's off putting and seemed rushed.","February 28","false","10.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sayagore/recommended/216910/","Sayagore","Pain&Prosperity","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sayagore/","2026 products in account","I finished this a while back so this isn't as fresh in my memory as it should. Also I have to be honest here, cyanide games are a guilty pleasure of mine. I always think there are some good ideas floating in their games but they don't manage to make the best out of all those ideas. That being said on to the main event.\n\nGameplay:\nYou play as 2 characters here and you can switch between them at any time once you get the second one. The first is the orc, Arkhail, and the second is the goblin, Styx.\nEach of them has 3 skill trees in which you can add points to get new abilities or improve an ability in 1 of 2 different ways that adds an effect like stun or lifesteal to that ability . Arkhail has a berserker and a tank tree and the 3rd has some actions that include Styx like throwing him towards enemies and later on when you choose a specialization class(story event) you get some more skills here. Styx has an assassin tree and ranged dagger throwing tree and the 3rd again has combo actions such as throwing a heal potion to Arkhail. These skill trees/wheels also count as stances that give different bonuses.\nSpeaking of potions there are none :P You have to keep your HP up by using skills, items with lifesteal and good planning before going into the fight.\nBoth characters can equip gear that drops or is found in chests and is specific for each character. While there isn't a whole lot of gear each new item you find will be different and sometimes they will be sidegrades instead of upgrades so they can be useful to the build you are using for them.\nThe fights can get rather challenging at times but all of them can be overcome with some good planning. The main thing to take into account is that Arkhail has a rage meter that can build up pretty fast and sends him into berserker mode where he is faster and stronger but you cannot control his actions and he sometimes takes pauses just to roar at the enemies in which time he gets pummeled. It's up to you if you want to go the berserker route and try to survive fights counting on his rage or go the tank way where you can control his rage and diminish with certain skills. Personally I went berserker for Arkhail and assassin for styx with a few skills from the other trees just enough to cover all my bases and it was fine though there were some fights that I had to restart quite a few times. It is by no means an easy game.\n\nGraphics:\nFrom a distance they graphics look OK but when the camera zooms in for conversations the textures are really bad and blurry. A high res texture pack would to wonders for the game but I doubt we'll ever see anything like that. There is variety in the locations you go as far as design but the overall color palette is pretty bland with a lot of browns and greys.\n\nSound:\nI'm not really good at this part. Thesound seems ok to me but maybe someone with a better ear will tell you differently. The music is good and the volumes are well implemented (as opposed to viking battle of asgard). My only issue here is that half the voice actors are bad. Arkhail and Styx are ok though and it's their banter that you will be hearing for most of the game anyway.\n\nStory:\nAt the beginning the human empire is waging a massive war against all greenskins and is winning. The chief of the clan tasks Arkhail with killing the emperor as to finish the war. Arkhail needs help getting to the emperor so a guide is hired and this is where Styx comes in. From there the story has all sorts of twists and turn, some that you will expect and others that you won't. I really enjoyed the story but what I enjoyed more was Styx. He's just one of those characters that you either love or hate and if you love him you can't get enough of him.\n\nBottom line:\nWhile there could be improvements done to all sorts of things it was an enjoyable RPG that has replay value at least for the way you can customize the play style of the 2 characters. Also take note that a lot of F-bombs are dropped, and I mean a whole lot (just in case you wanna give this to your kids to play and you're worried about that sort of thing).","January 13, 2014","true","12.7"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

(Provided you enjoy KotoR-esque combat, and don't mind an extremely linear experience.)\n\nThe Story, Characters, Combat, and World are all good and interesting, and effective at getting you invested. Plus personally, I seriously enjoyed the non-traditional-ness of the main characters. It's not often you play the Orc(s) and Goblin(s) in an RPG setting.\n\nBut of course, no game is perfect. There is one major problem with the game in my opinion.\nThe very beginning of Of Orcs and Men is bad, real bad. It's slow, and dull, and none of your combat abilities chain together at all. Of Orcs and Men makes a really bad first impression, so bad in fact, that it made me seriously consider dropping the game.\nBut it gets better, WAY better. I did not regret pushing forward, and chances are, you won't regret it either.\n\n(PS: There are a couple of other minor language-based Cons to the game: (1) The characters like to swear, a lot, and I personally was not a huge fan of it. (2) There is one point in which they drop the 'R'-word for what seems to be just shock factor. Its use makes sense in context, but they don't really explain the context before dropping it on you out of nowhere.)","February 7","true","13.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

Many people think that but I disagree. Actually, I enjoyed the storyline. After all, you are an orc and not the usual human greenskins killer! The game has different defects. The animations are not really synchronized and the AI looks pretty stupid many times. Those must be improved in a sequel honestly. Graphically I expected something really better, so I was a bit disappointed when I start playing it. I don't wanna talk about the gameplay.. it's really boring and it must be redone completely. I think a "more action" style would be more funny than simply clicking on skills and look at your characters doing the job for ya. There's also some micro-management in that, but nothing serious. As I said before, the storyline is nice and I played it just for it. Actually, there are different side quests, but, actually, I don't know if they affect the story at all. Oh,yes, one more thing: In my opinion, the "missions" are too short. Most of the time you'll be watching videos. They are not that bad but I'd like to play something more too. The right balance should be found. I didn't pay for a movie, but a videogame ;). This may be exaggerated but, still,  the good balance must be found. I'd recommend this game if you wanna play a nice storyline and love orcs.","July 1, 2014","true","10.6"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

Probably one of the more enjoyable Action RPG with tactical pause in recent years for a number of reasons.\n\nGood visuals and 3rd persion with a great perspective and decent controls that works well with a keyboard and mouse. It just is very easy and clean once you understand it. Very well done story with decent voice acting.\n\nItemization is a little simplistic yet effective. Inventory management and item upgrades are very streamlined for ease of use. Which struck me as a little odd given how challenging the game can be at times The end result is an interesting blend of streamlined yet difficult in that it requires planning and thought for how to approach fights.\n\nStealth gameplay was very well done and incredibly effective at helping you to progress through the game.\n\nIt is very linear however does not feel especially short or rushed.\n\nLimited character customizations outside of basic attributes and skill trees and there is no new game + so this not a game most will replay.\n\nI am the type of player who really likes exploring and finding all of the quests and yet doing that in this game I still could not break above 17.5 hours of gameplay. So while it is not too short it could have had a bit more content or at the very least new game+.\n\nOverall a solid 7 out of 10.\n\nHighly recommended at $15 or less.","August 23, 2014","true","17.6"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","0"

I like the characters, and the voice acting is pretty good. The concept is excellent. What a shame, then, that the mechanics are complete crapola.\n\nDid you play KOTOR and think, "Wow, this combat is too much fun. I don't think I can handle having this much fun. If only someone could do something similar, but make it boring and terrible."? If you did, then congrats, I've found the perfect game for you. Everyone else should stay away. This game would be better served by simple hack and slash combat, or Final Fantasy style turn based combat, or even a freaking DDR pad for me to stomp on to complete combat. Hell, it would have been better with no actual combat and just cutscenes showing combat. That's how bad the combat is - it would have been better if they had done nothing at all, because this combat is less than nothing.\n\nThe other mechanics aren't exactly brilliantly done either. The camera zooms in on an orc's massive back, and you can't zoom it out, so his shoulders take up about half of your screen width. The parts of the scenery I could see past his massive back looked nice, though.\n\nThis was a major disappointment.

It is the right balance, everything goes together and nothing really "sticks out." It's dark and secretive befitting the setting.\n\nSTORY: Interestingly attractive. At first, because we are all human, we think we get to play the anti-hero; but then, we realize we are actually playing the role of legitamate heroes, attempting to kill the man enslaving your people (though killing inocents still make you evil lol).\n\nCONS:\n\nLANGUAGE: Quite honestly the languae is immediatly offputting and breaks immersion. Having served in the military I am mainly desensitized to foul language and I understand and agree in some games colorful dialouge can inhance the tension or emotion of the scene. But this is basically a twelve year old trying to sound edgy by dropping the F-bomb every other sentence. It doesn't even flow with the characters themselves. It even happens in casual conversations between characters who seem to be friends. It's as if the voice actors who were hire are so stuck on their automatic swearing they couldn't turn it off just to make a game. Where are the antequated euphamisms, or the fantasy twinge on standard words (Frak anyone?), or even just making it more appropriate to the story? When he refered to Styx as vermin in the Orcish tounge that was great, but this school yard "look at me I give the game a mature rating" edgespeak is just a joke. It isn't offensive, it is annoying.\n\nMECHANICS: As mentioned in several reviews the mechanics are a bit "meh." The near time-stop action que is a great idea, but you feel like your character is always 3 actions behind everyone else.

Let me start by staying, I love the concept, to play as  an orc fighting humans for once, and the developers have created a rich & detailed world with interesting lore, as well as two well-written & interesting main characters. I'll happily read novels set in this world.  And the graphics are pretty good.\n\nBut everything else about this game is painfully uninspired.  Every level is a corridor, and some have long stretches with neither enemies nor points of interest.  Loot is rare and frequently boring, the skill-trees are uninteresting, and while combat has a novel design allowing you to switch between the characters & queue up actions, the result delivers neither interesting tactical challenges, or good action sequences.  Hard fights often find you leading your enemies in circles while trying to revive your other character - and this is not helped by comically bad hit detection that can see you killed by a swordstrike from 20 feet away.","March 29","false","21.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

It has serious issues. The pacing of the the storyline, the overall cut short game length, the corridor level design, the lack of enemy variety (there are only 5 types of character models in the whole game), shallow strategy, obstructive unadjustable camera, overly long cutscenes and the worst controlled in game target acquisition i have ever experienced. Sometimes my characters just deliberately ignored the appointed enemy and attacked what they felt like.\n\nI dont even know why i continued to play this game. The combat handling is unlike anything i have ever played before. This game does not know weather if it is a real time strategy game or a turn based RPG. The tutorial sequence is very short and taught me next to nothing at all. You get told pretty much nothing and have to inch yourself forward by trial and error. In fact the first 2 hours in this game were so bad i wanted to drop this game right on the floor.\n\nThe character management is not very noteworthy. You have few items slots that can be filled with pretty much few identical items. If you ever go for a defensive stance you are pretty much ♥♥♥♥ed. You can never respecc your Status or Skill Tree Points. If you made a poor decision once, your are stuck with it until the end of the game. The fact that some of the enemy encounters are just outrageous and you need to kite them around obstacles just to not ♥♥♥♥ing die in the blink of an eye is just ridiculous. I'm looking at you, Dog Trainer. What the ♥♥♥♥ was Cyanide even thinking.\n\nI give this game credit. Cyanide made a bold move daring to create their own dark fantasy themed franchise in this overly bloated market. As i was able to experience in the later Installment of Styx: Master of Shadows the team has a vision. I would compare it the closest to Warhammer. Dont get me wrong, i am very glad they do something independent and different and as much as i wish i could like the game just for that, i can simply not.\n\nThe graphic design of this game is acceptable to impressive. The main characters and the scenery stand out. They are nice examples of how to properly do greenskin characters. The sound design is acceptable. Fighting sounds and scenery music are good, though with 5 tracks a little short. Some of the characters have poor voice actors, while others have excellent ones. Styx ones is Excellent.\n\nThis game back in the day when it was released was overhyped. I don't know where the problem was, that the team was too much occupied with the foundation build of a new engine and a new fantasy brand, but it really hurt the overall game. It did not age well. Its just too short and the levels string badly together. The first and second chapter are so long that you will spend approximately 75% of your playtime there. The 3 last sections are so short that i was confused to the point where I wondered if I have accidently skipped some missions. It doesnt help either that they cut out crucial parts of the story with drawn cut scenes where you could be there out in the field making the way with actual gameplay.\n\nIt really is a regrettable waste of effort. If this game would have gotten a slightly bigger development team and about 6-12 months additional time, this may would have turned out to be an excellent game. Maybe even game of the year material 2013. But as it stands, Of Orcs and Goblins is a game only a RPG fan or a Ork enthusiast with a strong stomach can digest. I give it a 4 our of 10. Still , i hope Cyanide will just do the same as they Did with the stealth game in this series and deliver a new title that will surpass this one. The few times when the game was not teabagging me i was enjoying it. Remembered me of Metal Gear Rising a little. It has long elaborate cutscenes, which sadly can annoy or stress you at times. Some scenes were implemented poorly right in front of a difficult encounter and end up unskippable.\n\nThe current asking price of 30 euros is a little high. I recommend you wait for a sale and get it when it is under 10. Playing warning is adviced. Play on own risk.","August 9, 2015","false","42.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","4"

Please, save your money and don't buy it.\n●▬▬▬▬ஜ۩۞۩ஜ▬▬▬▬●\n×°×★Summary Review★×°×\nOverall Rating: ★☆☆☆☆ [1/5]\nStory: ★☆☆☆☆\nGameplay: ★☆☆☆☆\nSound: ★☆☆☆☆\n●▬▬▬▬ஜ۩۞۩ஜ▬▬▬▬●\nI've tried and tried to give this game a chance, but after 3 hours all I can conclude is that this is a prime example of a great idea gone wrong. Thanks to misguided game-tags this is being sold to players as an "Action, RPG, Story Rich" title. I'll tell you right now it is none of these things.\n\nFirst of all, the combat is clunky, even fans of this terrible game will tell you that's true. The combat is slow and strategy based, NOT an action game. Action games are free-flowing with non-stop "action" like Space Marine, Tomb Raider 2013, and Dragonball Xenoverse. Those are action games, this is not.\n\nAnd regarding the RPG elements, it's very easy to completely screw yourself if you don't spend your skill points in the right way. If that happens, you'll find yourself at the end of the game unable to finish, forcing you to start all over again, because there's no way to undo your skill points. This completely defeats the purpose of customization, which is the core element of an RPG.\n\nSecondly, the dialog feels like it was writen by a 13 year old trying to sound cool by swearing all the time. Honestly, there's no need for that much cursing. I'm by no means offended by it, it just doesn't feel appropriate to what's going on in the story. And the rest of the dialog is just, well, awful. Nothing about it is immersive.\n\nStory Rich? Really? Who tagged this game with that? Because it's not. The story is nothing more than your basic "Orcs VS Humans" genre. The original Warcraft had a better story to it than this. Either the developers didn't have a big enough budget to afford decent writers or they just didn't care. However, the end result is the same. A lack-luster experience that left me feeling cheated out of my money. There's no way in hell this game is worth $30. Maybe $9. Maybe. But it would still be awful.","October 19, 2015","false","3.1"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"

The issue is however that the game doesn't scale very well in difficulty. It scales about as well as if you were playing a JRPG and didn't grind nor buy any new equipment, despite me doing that in this game. I scowered for secrets and instead of making it seems like "You found a really awesome peice of a equipment, enemies can't touch you" or "You found a awesome sword that has the ability to stun" all it is, is a increase in damage which sounds nice and the upgrades you can get make some items 10x more effective, but the game seems to scale up to match this.\n\nSo much so that the part I was stuck on, the Orc had no armour or weapons (besides a giant stick)  but the goblin had the equipment, so I end up dying as the enemies are fighting me in the same quality as if I was fully decked out in all the best gear I worked hard with side missions to get and even then it only made battle difficulty scaled down to just above average.\n\nMost of these issues come down to the combat system. Fact is, you don't pause in combat but merely slow it down and as both your characters are mellee types (if we were to lable them classes, the Orc is a Barbarian and the Goblin is a Rogue) you have no ability to heal yourself. There is a potion ability the barbarian gets, but all that does is increase health regeneration which isn't the same thing.\n\nSteal elements are a joke at times. Sometimes I'm able to kill one guard next to another one and other times not. When dogs get introduced one of the tips is (don't try to assassinate the dogs. They can also smell you from a mile away so be careful) yet I've killed guards that were standing right behind the dogs and they didn't notice. Even though you turn transparaent when in stealth mode, moving in front of someone's vision will get you spotted.\n\nIt seems like there are many abilities and choices for an ability, which is locked in, unfortunatly it seems the game is designed for a very specific ability choices and bonuses and to level your characters up in such a specific way that one mis-placed point and you will mess up your character. the creators were also responsible for that terrible Game of Thrones RPG which had an even worse combat system to it.\n\nThat only good thing about it is the story and the twist on it being your heroes are the creatures usually considered monsters and evil, but here they are being invaded and enslaved by the human Empire and their plan is to kill the Emporor in hopes of destroying or atleast destabalising the empire and there is a religous side to it involving religious fanatics that have powers and spells.\n\nI'd recommend you just watch the cut-scenes online or someone's let's play because the game itself is generally not very user-friendly and very unfriendly to first-timers on the game too.","January 13, 2014","false","8.6"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"

The combat system is, as others have said, a little 'off' though still functional. It's a shame since the developers do seem to have really tried but the game just comes off as a bit boring.\n\nOn the positive side the soundtrack was good, if short (5 similar sounding songs) as were the graphics (both from a prettiness point of view and in terms of art style/matching the setting). The protagonists were also fun enough both individually and particularly when interacting with each other. The Stealth made for a nice change of pace and wasn't forced even in the specific stealth sections. I did enjoy picking off people slowly to make the inevitable fight easier on the big guy. The world could be interesting to revisit as it's just unique enough to interest me but it'd need a less repetitive game (preferably one with a working combat system).\n\nYou'll probably get your money's worth if you pick it up on sale but there isn't much replayability unless you really enjoyed it.\n\nIt might also have made for a good coop game.","May 11, 2015","false","16.6"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","45","5","11","0","0"

The weapon/gear upgrades are limited and the combat system isn't too terribly spectacular, but it gets the job done. However, I was determined to see it through, seeing as I spent my money on it.\n\nNeedless to say, I was surprised to find out the more I kept playing, the more I loved this damn game!

Honestly I have tried to like and complete  this game.  I have tried to play this game many times, but here are some positives about the game Of Orcs and Men.  The story for this game is different in a way that make you appreciate the bruiting orc or the snarky goblin you play as.  Instead of a regular redemption story this felt like more along the line of revenge with somewhat of a redemption story which is great twist that you sometime don't see in some big AAA games.\n\nHere is somethings that I did not like about the game that is keeping me from completion.\nI did not like the battle system for this game.  It seemed like it was based from Knights of the Old Republic but instead of having a party of 3 or even 4 you only have 2.  You are given a warrior and a rogue in your party which for me caused a lot of issues for the many plain and difficult battles. The battles did not seem to be designed well and I felt like I was over powered most of the time.  Boss battles are not well designed and are not memorable by any means. The one good thing you could do to make a battle easier was to get stealth kills, but you had to balance not being seen while having your other companion who could not use stealth be somewhat close before engaging in another battle.  This would allow you to get some stealth kills in but it wouldn't take long before someone seen your other companion and engaged battle.\nWhen I normally play games I try to play on the default setting which would normally be on normal but this is the first game where I felt so overpowered on normal I had to switched it to easy and I still feel like I am overpowered.\nTo me the loot system they had in this game was not needed and felt very shallow.\n\nI am not going to talk about the art in this game because I may not like it but others might.\n\nThis is my review on the game, so I hope that this is useful.\n","December 25, 2015","false","8.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

However, what actually happened was a very boring, very unresponsive combat.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Player_Ace/recommended/216910/","Player_Ace","Ace","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Player_Ace/","282 products in account","Of Orcs And Men has all the qualities of a great book: it lures you into its story and you are constantly interested in what will happen next. Character interaction isn't forced by putting them around a campfire at night and boasting stories over roast pig. We hear little of their stories, and we learn of the main characters by how they talk to eachother and to others, and you learn more about them in a good pace across the game.\n\nSadly, it also has flaws that comes with trying to simulate a good book in a videogame: the level designs and progress through the game are very linear, where the few stray paths are there to provide a little more gear, experience and sometimes a bit of story. The combat itself reminds me of Dragon Age 2, where you can queue up abilities in a slow-motion menu, where it is then executed in real-time. There's no shortage of abilities, but beyond the Rage and Concentration system, there isn't a very unique combat style. (In fact, on harder difficulties, certain abilities and builds are so much more effective than others, that combat itself can become repetitive).\n\nThe blend of shallow RPG-elements but great story elements does make it fun to play however. If you take all the optional sidequests, routes and talk with every NPC, the game has a surprisingly large amount of content. With only three achievements dependant on multiple choice, it's possible to get every achievement in the game with two instances of reloading to a previous save.\n\nA few last special notions to some of the more memorable notions of the game: it's graphics, it's world and it's soundtrack.\nThe graphics aren't very high-end, and with some ofthe more advanced games around, you won't be impressed. But it does a good job at imitating them, without being very demanding on your hardware.\nThe world it plays in is different from other fantasy RPGs - that much should be clear by the title alone! It's one of the few recent RPG-releases that's more interested in painting morals gray than black-and-white.\nThe soundtrack is from the Boston Cello Quartet, and is an absolute gem. It's also implemented into the game to play/loop certain parts of a soundtrack at certain points of combat/cutscenes; the soundtrack itself syncs with your level progression.\n\nOf Orcs And Men is a good recommendation, and it's a shame that Spiders Studio confirmed there are currently no plans for a much desired sequal. I personally found the price a bit too steep, but thankfully, Steam regulary allows sales and I managed to get Of Orcs And Men for a considerable discount.","December 21, 2013","true","25.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Of Orcs and Men is nothing short of a compelling tale of a reverse good-vs-evil plot. Although not necessarily a style only seen under fantasy, high or low, storylines, OO&M tackles those elements and tackles them HARD. Be ready to have some of your pre-conceived notions of fantasy twisted in a way that not even Shrek could come up with - and with a much more serious tone. Watch out for foul language (there is a LOT) if you'd like to avoid it. If you don't mind it like me, this will just bring much more life to this already vibrant world (after all, a rough orc and a shifty goblin aren't old ladies nor are their usual repertoire).\n\nNevertheless, there are some flaws: animation is pretty damn bad (the persistent use of the blatant same animations reminds me of KotOR of all things, in a sense that you can tell which animation is being used - for the 100th time), so is voice acting for anyone outside the main cast (although Arkail and Styx, the protagonists, sound perfectly as they should) and graphics are okay, at best - a medium-end machine or lower can play it maxed and indeed enjoy some good visuals. I also dislike how pretty much every section of the game is structured as a "corridor": you have optional pathways, but it really works as a road with just one blatant way to go - instead of a dungeon-crawler, this is a corridor-crawler.\n\nThe fascinating story, the likeable characters (despite sometimes feeling too one-dimensional, until late chapter 2, when things begin heating up) and the intriguing, almost turn-based, and simple (if played on easy) yet complex (on hard and *gasp* the frustratingly challenging Extreme difficulties) combat kept me going despite the flaws.\n\nReally enjoyed playing the game and I'm definetly playing it again sometime in the future. As well as keeping an eye out for future games from these devs.","November 5, 2013","true","24.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

There's the feel of a setting that's interesting, even if no one single element is original, the combination is. You play the last great hero of the orcs, sent on a one-way mission to avoid the final genocide of your race by assassinating the human emperor. But while you move through a non-standard fantasy story, the gameplay is the most railroaded since Railroad Tychoon 2: the Railroading. There's ONE way through each map, and usually only one valid tactic in each fight. Your sole impact on the game is the choice of skills, which don't actually change what the characters can do, just how well they do it.

Its primary method of play is strategy of combat.  You are provided with two protagonists, an Orc and a Goblin.  Most obviously, one is a brutish tank capable of dealing extreme damage and taking punishment, and the other is stealthy assassin capable of fighting both in melee and range, and is better suited to the delicate tasks.  That said, the impressive thing is how well the two characters pair in order to provide an excellent play experience.\n\nThe story behind the game is well written, and the voice acting for the characters is rather excellent.  The protagonists being an orc and a goblin is exciting, even if some of the storyline elements can be viewed as cliche.  In fact, the voice acting and writing is so well done it makes it obvious that the 'conversation' animations are limited.  That said, the limited animations feel 'right' to both the dialog and the gameplay.\n\nOf Orcs and Men is a game that focuses on the well defined and executed gameplay, rather than the shiny baubles most companies seem to focus their efforts on in order to distract the player from poor gameplay.  The pairing of the characters, and the inner dichotomies of their skill wheels provides rich gameplay for the mostly well designed battles and encounters.  Perhaps the most frustrating of encounters are the boss battles, because your have less time and space to plan and execute battle strategy, but it's just one more layer to an interesting game and story.","December 29, 2012","true","14.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

some immersion or something?\n-music was nice, atmospheric but forgettable. nothing to criticize here and nothing to remember, did its job.\n-i dont see why almost all good items were placed in the first act. after that i picked up a few here and there but very few really more useful, i mostly did it for variety. balance?\n-i still cant understand why developers think that its a good idea to make those who ultimately pay their salaries watch their logos every time the game is started. its an old grievance of mine and im certain im not alone with this. remember dawn of war (the first one)? you had to watch the intros for the first time (and it was sooo cool), after that, you could skip it. if you cant achieve that, let me skip it the first time. i didnt pay to suffer, thanks.\n-ah, you say, why dont you just alttab from the game instead of quitting? that way you can minimize your watching them again. and again. and again. 1. sometimes after alttabbing the music stays on, so you have to mute it and then unmute it, doable of course but inconvinient; 2. once i couldnt manually save after coming back from desktop. but of course i didnt know that was the reason, i thought the game is screwing with me not letting me save (in a way it did), and that was the first time i almost uninstalled it as i had to fight through some hard battles and when i died i had to start anew from much further. alttabbing btw: they still did much better job than bethesda - they cant solve this conundrum (among others) since morrowind (2002!)...\n-ah, battles? you have a map where you p1ss blood to survive (and i dont mean bosses) and the next five is cakewalk. again, balance?\n-i felt i spent too much time watching cutscenes. dont misunderstand me, i like meself a good story but it seemed to me sometimes that i have to watch 5 minutes of cutscenes to play the same amout of time. maybe i just wanted to get over with this game to start another with better entertainment/frustration ratio, i dont know, i generally like these story elements.\n-you cannot skip all cutscenes. im at the endgame where i failed twice miserably and i have to watch half of the damned talking to try again, and of course no saves between battles. thanks, devs. im not sure im willing to do it more than 1 or 2 times more and however i hate to leave a game unfinished, especially so close to its ending theres a good chance that i will in this case.\n\nall in all with some polishing and playtesting, balancing the powers/items/battles this could have been a much better title.\n\nmy story with of orcs and men: i followed news about it. it was released, i waited for sale, bought it on sale. waited to have some time to play it. quite liked it but was somewhat annoyed. run into the alttab-nosave problem, almost deleted it. i enjoyed somewhat more after that. searched for the styx game, addet to wishlist. got to the end, got frustrated, removed styx from my wishlist and i will try again the endgame for a few times.\n\nnow, despite all the criticism above, dont be (completely) disheartened: this game have some nice features and might be much more entertaining for you than it was for me. if you love the genre and you feel you can forgive the problems above, go give it a try. i almost gave it a 'slightly recommended' but the coin thought otherwise.\n\nEDIT: i could beat zealot for the 3rd try somehow, so i have finished the game. still, this fact does not much to redeem the game as a whole, so the 'not recommended' flag stays. this means i also got to the end credits, where the playtesters were listed: all 6 of them. that is not too many and i am sorry but it showed.","February 10","false","27.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The story was interesting; the graphics were fair; the controls were good. 'Of Orcs And Men' had a lot of potential to be a GREAT game, but some of it's bugs and shortcomings bring it down. Nevertheless, I recommend giving it a play-through.\n\n--- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---\n\nI will not rehash the concept behind 'Of Orcs And Men'; there are plenty of reviews which lay out the concepts of this title. What will follow is a collection of problems I had with 'Of Orcs And Men'.\n\nGraphics: Character designs for anything that's not a goblin or orc are painfully mediocre. Humans and dogs are bland at best, and many of their animations are very stiff. Shadow quality is poor. Many of the animations, particularly in cut-scenes, can be a bit jittery.\n\nDialogue: The early game is pretty good. Arkail and Styx were done mostly well throughout the game. Other voice actors are often bland, wooden, or outright BAD. The voice work for the one dwarf in the game is HORRIBLE, sounding as though it may have been "read" by a computer generated voice... it was THAT BAD!\n\nGeneral Combat: Throughout 'OOAM' you will very often find yourself swarmed by small hordes of enemies. This is great, as it lends to the sense of awesomeness of the protagonists. Many of your combat abilities cause crowd control effects, such as stun, which are often necessary to survive some encounters. While it's understandable for some enemies to be more resistant to these effects than others, there seems to be an anti-CC-lock mechanic in place, which seems to prevent MOST enemies from being stunned more that once or twice. This would be great if it worked both ways! I found in some combats, particularly those with magic-wielding Inquisitors, that the enemy's ability to unerringly CC you can easily lead to your death if one of your characters falls, making it impossible for the conscious character to rouse the unconscious one.\n\nA.I. Combat: Arkail and Styx are a team. You can control either character, and whichever you are not controlling is directed by the A.I. when not given a list of specific commands, or when that list runs out. Additionally, if you are scouting ahead with Styx, and get detected, Arkail will not automatically run to his side to fight with him! This can be particularly tricky if there is a bit of distance between the characters. Opening up the command menu will slow time to a crawl, allowing you to issue commands, but you can only move the characters in real time, and you can't control them both at the same time. This often leads to having to run Styx back to wherever you left Arkail, who will be waiting there with a thumb up his .... Adding to the A.I. combat frustration, stuns and other such crowd control effects used against you will not only interrupt the character while trying to execute a command, it will often clear their command queue, meaning they will not resume the queue once the effect has passed. This can often be detrimental, particularly in cases where you've queued a character to perform a vital self-heal.\n\nA.I. Pathing: There are many points where one character will get stuck and not follow the lead character (especially if you're scouting with Styx.) Additionally, there are a few locations where even the character you're controlling won't respond to a given command due to a pathing problem. What's worse, this often leads to enemies (at least the melee variety) completely ignoring that character and ganging up on the other one. If the "invisible" character is Arkail, be prepared to watch Styx meet his doom VERY QUICKLY!\n\nMiscellaneous Issues: 1. While the story for 'Of Orcs And Men' is fairly interesting, some of the conversations can be painfully length, especially in a few of the scenarios where you have died (sometimes multiple times) and are forced to repeat a lengthy bit of dialogue. This can be even more obnoxious if the game won't allow you to skip the dialogue. 2. The armor upgrade system is extremely simple, giving every item in the game a single upgrade. What's more, the game does not give you any sort of preview as to how much this will improve an item. At early stages, when trade points are sparse, it can be quite irritating to upgrade an item only to find your currently equipped gear is still better. At later stages, when you have mages who can supposedly "enhance" your equipment, this could have been made significantly more interesting by adding effects to gear rather than the same enhancements you would get from any other merchant you had dealt with at earlier points. Equipment upgrading was very lackluster. 3. Saving, at later stages in the game, is virtually pointless OR inaccessible, forcing you to rely on autosaves, as you may be forced to soldier on through a series of several combats before the next save. This was particularly obnoxious at the end of the game, as a death with the boss fight would force replaying three or four consecutive combats AND a lengthy, unskippable dialogue scene. 4. Arkail's weapon after loading. It seemed that after every break (quitting the game, and loading it back up at a later time), Arkail's weapon would no longer look like what he had equipped, and would instead look like a simple stick/club. It wasn't until near the end of the game I realized this was because Arkail would somehow unequip his weapon upon reloading the game! This is a minor issue, as you simply have to re-equip his weapon, but this shouldn't even happen in the first place. I also had this happen randomly during play, usually after the occasional cut-scene. 5. At a late point in the game, both Arkail and Styx are each given the choice between two advancement paths which grant access to additional abilities. The game does not give any indication as to what the different advancement paths with grant, so players who are more interested in the abilities they will gain rather than the story reason for selecting a given path will find this lack of insight a bit irritating. 6. Styx is all about stealth, but this option becomes an increasingly less viable option the more the story advances. I found there was almost no point to stealth at the end game. Dogs cannot be assassinated, very few enemies are positioned in ways which allow for stealth kills, and those who are are often extremely weak anyway, so there is not much point to wasting time with sneaking. As a proponent of stealth-based games, I found this highly disappointing. Additionally, the few times where you are forced to play solo as Styx, you are thrust into the combat with no option for approaching with stealth. If you don't build Styx to be tough (focusing on Stamina), this can make for a ludicrously difficult combat.\n\nGeneral Gameplay Weakness: While there are many options available to the player as they advance Styx and Arkail, the best option is to focus on Arkail's defensive abilities and Styx's ranged abilities. Optimally, focusing on Stamina for both these characters will make them extremely tough, and make the game far easier to beat. Essentially, this is the only "right" way to play, particularly at the higher difficulty settings.\n\n--- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---\n\nAll that said, the game was very engrossing. When I would play, several hours would easily pass, and I didn't want to stop until I had finished.","May 17, 2015","true","26.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You can mostly only play it on easy or normal. For other difficulty you need to know what skill you will get and what state your character must have and you must have luck that the game mechanic don't ♥♥♥♥ your game to hard. I mean you are surrounded by enemy's and you can not activate one skill or run away. The aggro bar is in a second full and that it your dead, because the orc takes hours before attacks or do something. In addition is there a problem with the enemy focus. You tell your character which enemy to attack but your character do nothing or attack the wrong guy.\n\n\nThe moment you accepted a request you wont be able to cancel it later in-game. The only chance you get is to delete your save-game and start from the beginning.\n\nDid you skill your character wrong than that's it. You cannot reset your skill points. You need to play it trough till the end with the wrong skills or delete your save-game and start new.\n\nThe combat system is a matter of habit. For the combat system you need to select a enemy then you tell your character what to do with skills. Attack or counter an attack but you can't change it in combat. You can try it but your character mostly wont do it. You don't have an intervention in the fight you can only tell your character what the next move will be.\nThere I mean you don't play with the mouse button to attack you attack with learned skills or defend or interact with the second character.\n\nThan is there problem with the map itself. Over and over again you will stuck on stairs, stones , boards etc.. Mostly is the second character stuck in areas where you mostly ask "why did you stuck there??" or "where is the goblin/orc??" and you can not move on because of the distant limits.\n\nNote:\n\nFor an finished product this game has to much errors and that 30€  are to much.

You can mostly only play it on easy or normal. For other difficulty you need to know what skill you will get and what state your character must have and you must have luck that the game mechanic don't ♥♥♥♥ your game to hard. I mean you are surrounded by enemy's and you can not activate one skill or run away. The aggro bar is in a second full and that it your dead, because the orc takes hours before attacks or do something. In addition is there a problem with the enemy focus. You tell your character which enemy to attack but your character do nothing or attack the wrong guy.\n\n\nThe moment you accepted a request you wont be able to cancel it later in-game. The only chance you get is to delete your save-game and start from the beginning.\n\nDid you skill your character wrong than that's it. You cannot reset your skill points. You need to play it trough till the end with the wrong skills or delete your save-game and start new.\n\nThe combat system is a matter of habit. For the combat system you need to select a enemy then you tell your character what to do with skills. Attack or counter an attack but you can't change it in combat. You can try it but your character mostly wont do it. You don't have an intervention in the fight you can only tell your character what the next move will be.\nThere I mean you don't play with the mouse button to attack you attack with learned skills or defend or interact with the second character.\n\nThan is there problem with the map itself. Over and over again you will stuck on stairs, stones , boards etc.. Mostly is the second character stuck in areas where you mostly ask "why did you stuck there??" or "where is the goblin/orc??" and you can not move on because of the distant limits.\n\nNote:\n\nFor an finished product this game has to much errors and that 30€  are to much. There should be an hotfix for this game. The combat system should be overworked.

Speaking as not a sailor, I still don't like it.\n\nIt may be a good looking RPG but the dialogue is pretty bad. The only way that the writers thought to convey that the orcs were angry was to add common swears such as "F*ck" and "s*it" into the dialogue. And for me, that really puts me off. I mean moderate curses throughtout the dialogue would have been better to deal with but in nearly every dialogue it's just said almost nonchalantly. It's not a make or break deal for the game but it does make me lose interest and any sense of immersion pretty fast.\n\nMaybe the game gets better after you stomach through the bad dialogue choice. I wouldn't know. I was captivated by the thought of the story and how it seemed like it was a different RPG -styled game. I was deterred after the dialogue made every bit of my immersion shatter like a windscreen underneath a 100 foot towering tree.\n\nBut hey. If you don't mind the constant "f*ck this" or whatever, then by all means. It's got pretty grpahics and all that and the water running over the character models is pretty geniune. I'd rather go and find a better RPG that doesn't have "f*ck" used more common than another swear in some parts of Australia.","November 22, 2013","false","0.5"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

It's a linear RPG where you control an orc and a goblin. The goblin is good for debuffing and silently killing off enemies and the orc can be used for mob control basically. There's also a tag team move where you can throw away the goblin and inflict massive damage.\nThe camps you visit will act as a hub for your quests.\nThat doesn't sound all that exciting, right ? It's not, really. But the combat mechanic is somewhat fresh. During combat you can pause the game and choose your actions. Yes, we've seen it before. But maybe it's because of the characters; they're exact opposites of each other and that's what makes it so fun to play.\n\nLet's see, what else... the game can be finished in approximately 12-15 hours. The graphics are amazing; the whole things runs at a solid 60FPS. The voice acting is quite alright and the music is very good.\n\n[Rating: 85/100]\nRecommended !

I thought "wow, an orc driven game!" which got me going right away as i love the greenskin races. everything i'd seen including artwork, trailers and so on pointed to it being a fantastic game full of action and freedom to experience the lush, rich world that the creators so painstaikingly created.\n\nthe pros: it is a beautifully animated game, well voiced and intriguing from the first minute. the two main characters are deep and interesting. it made me want from minute one to explore and play this game, (right up until the combat that is.) the musical score is amazing, that much that i bought it for my roleplaying group games.\n\nThe cons: The downside of this game comes in the disappointing gameplay. it is done in the same format of SWTOR and dragon age which i find a bit annoying anyway, preferring the feeling of fully controlling the character. the switching between two characters isn't in my opinion very well done, and i found myself fighting to keep both alive instead of accomplishing team maouvers etc.\n\nthe games pace in general isnt very fast, and it feels like a game in its development stage still. it is also criminally restrictive, railroading you which is even worse as the game looks beautiful but there is very little interaction.\n\nat best, a 6/10 simply for the idea and the music. the game is not good at all.

But here are the main reasons why I choose to thumbs down this game.  First, the field of view is truly annoying.  For a 3rd person game, one has to rely on moving the mouse too much.  Second, the clunky "que" system to fight.  Each character has up to 4 slots to que up an action.  Even though through the course of this game I did get used to it...it is still a really terrible way for actions to be given.  Third, you have two characters.  One is for stealth and assassination the other is a fighting "tank".  ALL situations are perfect for the fighter.  Not all situations are perfect for the assassin.  Why?  Seriously!  Why?  If you are going to have two characters to control give them both an equal amount of situations where their skills are perfect.  I can't even begin to relate how many times I snuck up on a group of enemies only to find out I can't assassinate anyone because of the way they were placed.  Why even give that option to the players then?  Thirdly, there isn't a lot of loot and there is ZERO gold.  Want to upgrade?  Want to get new weapons or armour?  You need "trade points".  You get trade points with the scant few random chests that only contain ONE item or are given a couple here and there by the game.  None of the items end up being all that great even with the "upgrades".  It is hard to tell the difference between one item to the next.  They all feel basically the same in the long run.  Fourth, and last (just to keep it short)...  There are a LOT of cutscenes in this game.  Most you can skip over.  The ones for the last battle YOU CANNOT SKIP!  Imagine this...  You are fighting the last battle and die.  When you begin again you realise not only do you have to fight two battles until you get to the last battle but you have to watch the cutscenes!  You CANNOT SKIP THEM!  THEY ARE ALSO LONG CUTSCENES!  That's right.  The makers of this game give a BIG "F-You!" to the players with a three battle and two cutscene ending where you cannot skip the cutscenes.  True, you there are segments where you can "fastforward" but the cutscenes still last MINUTES.  You might think, "Minutes aren't that bad..."  But when I am able to get up, walk to my kitchen, get a drink, come back and I still have a long time to wait...  THAT is too long.  THAT is the epitomy of annoying and unneccissary.\n\nThe end battle is winnable.  The unskippable end battle cutscenes WILL make you rage-quit so you will never win it.\n\nMy two cents?  Save yourself the aggravation and frustration and pass on this game.  If they EVER fix it so you can skip the end battle cutscenes then yes, by all means get it.  But I doubt they will ever do that so pass on this one.","February 21, 2015","false","12.1"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

The premise sounded very interesting and the idea of playing as an Orc for once made it even better. However, I held off on purchasing the game. I know Focus does not always release the best of games and I usually give them some time to get all the bugs and stuff under control before I purchase any of their titles. I also saw the critic scores that were just mediocre, but I don't always agree with critics.\n\nI said all that to say I have been waiting to play this game for quite a while now and was eager and convienced I would enjoy it. The story is pretty good. The dialouge options are really nice. It's great to hear your character actually say your dialouge choices instead of the silent avatar syndrome. Combat is meh. It's exactly the same as Game of Thrones. It's a mix of real-time/Turn-based combat that has you switching your attention between controlled characters. The problem I have with combat in Of Orcs And Men is the same problem I had in Game of Thrones. All encounters seem to have a slim margin of victory. You will focus on one characters attacks and after issuing 2 or 3 skills, you'll notice the other character is about to die. I don't understand how both of my characters seem to always be near death everytime I change focus. As well the skills you choose in combat aren't all that varied and I found myself sticking to a one two punch combo with my Orc and leaving the goblin as fodder since he's worthless in combat.\n\nCombat can be forgive though. I don't mind a challenge as long as the story is good. The reason I do not recommend Of Orcs And Men is FOV!!! That's right! The field of view for this game has to be about 30. Your Orc takes up 45% of the screen. If you choose to switch to the Goblin you're presented with a super zoomed in view. The graphics are great, the set pieces are nice, why they chose to make the view so damn limited and not show off their work defies logic. Game of Thrones had the same issue, but there was a work around. This game has none. It feels like you're trying to play a game while wearing your creepy uncle's coke bottle glasses. I got so dizzy that, after only 1 hour of play I had to stop. I felt like I was going to throw up. Even 30 minutes after playing the game I still feel slightly dizzy. Of Orcs And Men has to worst FOV I have ever experienced in a game.  I doubt I will ever play another Focus release again.","January 19, 2014","false","1.0"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

This is a painfully linear game. The vast majority of it is spent running through brown and gray winding corridors with evenly spaced groups of enemies to encounter. What choices you are able to make, both in moving about the world and within the story, ultimately don't have much real impact. The voice acting for the two main characters, Arkail and Styx, is high quality but the remaining cast ranges from bad to atrocious.\n\nThe major selling point for this game, playing from the greenskins' perspective, is implemented with mixed success. The character arcs of Arkail and Styx are both enjoyable. Their personality's balance each other out with Arkail being the brawn and honor type and Styx being the brainy and cautious one. Unfortunately the game follows a lot of stereotypes in terms of orc behavior and in a storyline centering around slaves revolting against power hungry evil rulers. Change the orcs into humans from a warrior tribe led by shamans and very little would change. That makes the story feel more human relatable but also cheapens the greenskins' perspective feature, making it seem like more of a surface change or gimmick.\n\nA lot of reviewers have commented negatively on the excessive use of foul language and I'm inclined to agree. It's not that I am offended by the words but that it feels forced, like a misguided attempt to make the game more dark and gritty. The script is otherwise decent with Styx's dialogue being the best it has to offer ranging down to some of its one dimensional villains being its worst.\n\nI enjoyed the combat during the middle hours of the game but not in the remaining hours. At the start your options are limited before you unlock more attacks and there is a bit of an awkward learning curve. Later on, the repetition got to me as the same strategy that worked early in the game worked all the way through, making most fights feel the same. Styx's ability to stealth assassinate enemies before you are spotted was a feature that I eventually stopped bothering with. I found it wasn't necessary to win most fights, slowed things down and wasn't particularly fun.\n\nOf Orcs and Men's biggest success in my opinion is its soundtrack. It stands out with a unique style that features a lot of cello and drums. As soundtracks often go, not every track is interesting but on the whole I found it catching my ear numerous times throughout the game.\n\nThere are situations where I would recommend Of Orcs And Men but overall I didn't find this game to be good enough to recommend to most people. For example, diehard action RPG fans who have already exhausted the higher rated games in the genre might find something worth playing here.","November 15, 2014","false","13.9"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","2","6","0","0"

If you love story driven RPGs, I highly suggest considering this game. Tons of games talk about "Mature Themes" but this one really hits that nail on the head, and not just from the adult language (which there's a lot of). It covers racism, slavery, political ambition, violence, and betrayal. I felt both of the main characters were well written and it was interesting to see how their interactions with each other evolved as the story progressed.\n\nNow onto the actual game systems.\n\nThe combat system isn't going to be everyone's cup of tea. It's just like Game of Thrones, super slow mow where you can queue up 4 moves for each character. If you haven't played GoT, it's like KOTOR but without the actual pause. Difficulty of combat spikes a bit too and can be pretty hard when you don't get assassinations done before hand.\n\nThe game is really linear and there's almost no exploration. There's a handful of side quests but, they need to be done right then and there. Maps are very railroady with minimal hallway detours to find an occasional goody.\n\nEach hero has 2 full trees and another tree split in half to work together/class specialty. It's by no means one of the most flexible systems in the genre but, it is far better than many others.\n\nGame also isn't a huge, 40+ hour epic. I would expect 10-25 hours depending on difficulty with combat.","February 21, 2014","true","8.3"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

The artwork and environments are beautiful, but level design doesn't seem too well thought out. There's a lot of walking down hallways without much to do lacking even character dialogue to entertain you.\n\nCombat is very good. I really enjoyed the different skills that were available and the strategy that came into play in most battles. And you have to employ the strategic menu during battles or you will fail.\n\nWhich is where combat was annoying. Most of the difficult battles occure immediately after a long cutscene which means if you die (and you very likely will again, and again, and again) you have to go through the cutscene (again and again and again). You can skip by pressing Esc repeatedly, but it's just incredibly frustrating. Also, the battles aren't very well balanced. I breezed through most of the game on easy so that I could enjoy the story, but then cam across maybe 3 battles that took me forever to get through. I almost just quit the game and gave up it was that frustrating.\n\nAnyway, voice acting was good and engaging but the script seemed quite stilted at points. The characters swore a lot, which I don't mind, it just seemed overdone to me and came across as the writers using swear words more as a publicity stunt rather than for dramatic emphasis. Maybe that's just me.\n\nThe storyline and characters were great. Kept me interested for the duration of the game and I really enjoyed watching how the main two characters developed and got to know eachother as the game progressed.\n\nAI was a little messed up (which was also frustrating). If you ever leave one of the characters to do their own thing for a bit during combat, they are bound to do something stupid, like target the guy furthest away so they run past every other enemy and get killed on the way. Or sometimes they'll just stand there and you can't tell why. You've given them commands to carry out, you're pretty sure they haven't been stunned, but they're not responding to anything.\n\nAlso, the still warm corspe of a soliders friend is apparently an everyday sight, cause they won't do anything about it. You can kill 10 people and then watch a patrol just walk over their bodies and go on their way without raising an alarm or even breaking stride. Not a game breaker, but weird for a modern game. It does make stealth assassinations a piece of cake.\n\nMy recommendation. Play it on easy just for the sake of the story, otherwise the long hallways, frustrating battles and inconsistent AI aren't worth the effort.","September 13, 2014","true","11.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

The main characters are well written (despite the unnecessary profanity) and their reluctant team dynamic is fun.  The gameplay is the best part: building out both characters into the rolls I chose for them (it's clear there are several viable combinations of builds) was satisfying.  Neither character can succeed on its own so designing and implementing a team strategy was rewarding, and the challenge on normal was just right.  Each encounter felt like a discrete combat puzzle, and so I didn't mind that the levels were, almost without exception, linear pathways from one encounter to the next because I looked forward to the next encounter.  The graphics do the job: sometimes pretty, sometimes ugly, usually just fine.  The music is sparse, but has character.  The supporting cast is, for the most part, poorly acted, which is the only truly disappointing aspect of the game.\n\nIn sum, if you want a combat focused RPG with two likable characters and an interesting story, and can excuse the small budget presentation, this game is definitely worth the 12-15 hours it takes to finish.","October 6, 2014","true","15.0"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

In fact I recommend this game only to fans of the tactical-RPG genre, as even action-RPG fans may be spurned. Combat is slower and more strategic then most hack and slashes (stealth can be the key factor of progression). The skill trees (or should I say circles) require a great deal of attention as they can become crucial in fights. This game does a lot of things right, but it's challenge requires perseverance. Graphics and story are top notch like most RPGs, however choice never seemed to play a real role outside of differing cutscenes/achievments. I also would've liked a stronger economy and more inventory options. If you plan to tackle this one I recommend buying it on sale that way you won't be too disappointed should you not enjoy.","July 7, 2014","true","11.7"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Beautiful world! Game play sucks! The line up attacks combat style, and control of two characters in combat was tedious and boring! The Goblin dies if you blink, and the Orc will rage taking control (at which point he kills the goblin) unless you constantly burn turns to calm him down. If you do take the time to calm the Orc expect to get roped every time you do so. By the end of the game I was picking rage inducing attacks to get it over with, and just playing the Goblin through combat as support for a bot that gets stuck on corners. Once the Orc rages it is just as likely to turn, and attack the Goblin so combat becomes "Hit and run the puck away!" The actual game play is just move, and fight. It's a "hack and slash" without any real control of the "hacking and slashing". The stealth play is like a bad joke as the enemies can only see the stealthed Goblin if its sucking their bick, or skull pucking the guy next to them. Linear  levels, and bad game play aside.

I really enjoyed this console ARPG in its PC form with a gamepad. It has nice visuals, sound and music as well as a very good story with likable dual protagonists, both of whom you control throughout the adventure. The combat system which goes into slow motion when you hit a button to begin selecting up to 4 attacks or abilities and returns to normal speed when you are done is fluid, involving and fun. Switching between the characters in combat is a breeze. The streamlined UI is a pleasure to use with a gamepad. The game is very light on loot but your characters are always progressing via level ups with new skills and abilities as well as loot you acquire from chests and defeated enemies. You sometimes also get loot from merchants who can (and you'll always want to do this) upgrade your armor and weapons. The game is not about constant looting of stuff though. It is about two great characters on a quest with a good story with fun combat along the way. The Orc Arkail, is a warrior and the Goblin, Styx is a rogue who is a lot of fun to use for his stealth abilities at times. I found it best to develop Arkail as a tank and Styx as melee DPS but you can give focus to DPS on Arkail and ranged DPS on Styx if you prefer. I give it a 8 out of 10 and feel the game was underrated by professional reviews and some PC gamers alike who I think didn't give it a fair chance based on it not being a "PC game" but rather a console game ported to PC.

I decided that it looked good and I was only out around 8 bucks if it sucked.  This has turned out to be one of my favorite games atm.  I've been playing games for over 35 years and have loved many linear games, this one included.  The fighting is akin to Dragon Age: Origin.  I thought the graphics were great.  The story was excellent and I loved the humor in this game.  I finished one playthrough and restarted to pick up the rest of the achievements.  I would give this game a strong 8.5 rating.  At the full price of $29.99 I would have been very happy with my purchase but at under 8 bucks, I'm ecstatic.

I myself only picked it up during the recent winter sale & there is little about it on the web, especially positive. I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this game given how much negativity there is surrounding it.\nI am a fantasy lover & playing as something other than yet another human or elf was a welcome change.\nThe twist is that the orcs & goblins are the oppressed race who are  brutally murdered, tortured & turned into slaves & pets by the evil human race.\nOf course not all orcs are pleasant & not all humans are power hungry racist zealots.\nThe music was a character itself, it has been a while since I really got into the music in a game & have found myself humming various songs.\nThe combat is rather like that of Dragon Age, during battle you can hold space to slow down the action to a crawl giving you time to select what skills you want the characters to use; doing so is advisable as you won't win many battles spamming the auto attack. Although I found for the tougher bosses spamming the stun punch is pretty much the only way you can win. The game has it's faults, auto saves can be annoying, the last fight in particular, some parts of the cutscenes cannot be skipped, you will often get stuck in endless revives meaning just as you revive one character the one doing the reviving will die & this can go on & on & on dragging out fights. Much like The Walking Dead this game is a one time ride, it's linier & everything is a corridor so unless you care about achievements enough to go through a second time I doubt you'll play more than once. I personally found the use of the word ♥♥♥♥ & it's variations distracting, not that I'm offended by swearing I just thought it was used way too much & isn't really a curse word that fits the setting; I prefer it when fantasy games make up their own curse words.\nAll in all I had fun with this game, certainly enough to recommend it though not at full price given it's issues & short length.","December 27, 2012","true","13.9"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I was compelled to buy Of Orcs & Men by the idea of your typical fantasy setting being inverted to the point where the orcs are the heroes and the humans are the barbaric oppressors/invaders. Unfortunately, the game tries WAY too hard to be funny, edgy, and gritty when all it really needed to do was be epic in the literal sense. I don't typically mind profanity, but the dialogue is so frought with cursing, sexual innuendo, and poor attempts at wit that it alternates between feeling forced and being downright juvenile. When it isn't being juvenile, the game is constantly going out of its way to remind you that this is the F--king GRIMDARK, and everything sucks. The humans are EVIL, man. The orcs are BADASS, dude. Essentially, everything in this game seems to be a charicature with little in the way of depth. This is extremely unfortunate given the incredible potential of the setting.\n\nLess than an hour in, and I just can't play anymore. I really want to like this game, but I've seen enough. I might be willing to soldier on and hope that the dialogue and plot/character development improve, but the controls and gameplay also leave quite a bit to be desired.

I thought that this might be an improvement on the Dragon age fight controls but it allows you even less control.

No Climbing, no crouching, and to get at targets you have to throw the goblin at them.

Nothing but pointless and repetitive swearing. I understand the premise and in war swearing is commonplace; that whole swearing like a sailor metaphor rings a bell. Although I WISH they would swear like a sailor, it would at least be more colorful. Every two minutes its, "look at me I said the word ♥♥♥♥." Yes, ♥♥♥♥ is a versitile word but there are a variety of other swear words that can be used to articulate communications between characters. And dont give me the crap about how "theyre dumb, theyre orcs and only know how to kill." The first scene shows complex communication and articulation, Its a very wierd disconnect to go from "Oh, why thank you. Look at my manners, arent I so polite," to "♥♥♥♥. Me swing ♥♥♥♥ing sword. You bleed all over ♥♥♥♥ing ground," (not actual quotes). Was the script proof read by a 13 year old who just discovered he can swear among friends?\n\nOh right this is a game. WHY DO I HAVE TO MICRO MANAGE EVERYTHING? I undestand the game developer probably didnt want another hack and slash game but this is not the way to do it, Im just hacking and slashing really slow. I also understand that other games have done this sort of mocromanaging well such as dragon age: origins.\n\nThe way this game's comabt works is that you have to issue commands on the fly in a slowed down period which essentially pauses the fight every 20 seconds. Lets return to DA:O, you created a preset queue of attacks to perform based on certian battle conditions with respect to the individual character's skills and abilities. Because its all preset the combat happens a lot faster and creates more complex combat scenarios.\n\nIn DA:O you can interupt individual characters from performing their attack queues (or even quickly switch to a different preset queue) to issue specific commands to address a unique battle situation. In Orcs and Men, you dont get that tactical experience, the attack queue is created on the spot and then terminated, repeating every few seconds. This would be a thousand times more bareable if I could issue my character to auto attack when I dont have attcks in the queue.\n\nAlthough, I do like the slow down aspect of the battle rather than a complete pause because that forces the player to act and not just sit there and figure out every small detail.","August 19, 2014","false","0.6"," 7 of 17 people (41%) found this review helpful","41","7","17","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lucky_Dwarf/recommended/216910/","Lucky_Dwarf","Cousin Okri","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lucky_Dwarf/","111 products in account","A trully underrated gem. If you have never heard about this game, its because it's had next to no marketing done on it.\n\nOn the surface it may seem like your standard Lord of the Rings fare, but the story takes the opposite side of the coin. You take on the role of the Orc Beserker and Goblin Assasin, Arkail and Styx, in their quest to kill the Emperor before he unites his forces with those of Elves and Dwarves to enslave all of Orc kind.\n\nI won’t give away much else, but I’ll tell you a few things that drew me into this setting.\n\n-Goblins behave more like rabid dogs than cowardly humans, and there’s never been any sign of goblin intelligence before(excepting Styx). This is an issue that troubles our goblin protagonist greatly and is explored in the game.\n\n-Orcs are a victimized and enslaved people whose great strength has been used to build towering citadels and a giant wall that pins them in their jungles.\n\n-Magic is a much more subtle and acts more like The Force in Star Wars does. You don’t really have access to any magic yourself, but the way magic is used strikes me as being a lot more interesting than throwing fireballs and such.\n\n-Inquisition and a Tyrannical Human empire.\n\nSo let’s talk game play! Of Orcs and Men is an RPG game akin to Knights of the Old Republic in two ways.\n\n1. It features a dialog system common to alot of modern day RPG's like Mass Effect, Dragon Age, KotOR, and Star Wars: The Old Republic. These game all have the player controlling one central protagonist(Shepard, Hawk, or The character you create). Of Orcs and Men is made unique by its dual protagonist storytelling, where the player has the choice of Arkail or Styx handling the situation similar to how Paragon/Renegade work in Mass Effect (But no Karmic Meter to call you a good or bad guy, which is refreshing).\n\n2. The Combat is similar to KotOR, you pause the game at will to que up attacks you want to perform, and then once the game is unpaused, Styx and Arkail perform the actions as qued. The two characters that you control throughout the game both have their own unique set of attacks, and resource systems to manage. They complement each other well, Arkail being a powerhouse that needs to be managed, lest he kill himself in a rage, and Styx disabling enemies, and making Arkails job easyer.\n\nLet me tell you the most fun aspect of the combat. Arkail is a delicate machine. He operates on a rage based mechanic, he builds rage in combat based on various attacks he performs. When this meter fills completely, Arkail goes into a rage. You lose control of him for the duration, and he becomes delicate wrecking ball or Orcish glory.\nThe leveling system allows the player to increase stats and unlock various attacks that shape how you play from encounter to encounter.\n\nThere’s also an optional stealth element in the game, but it is poorly implemented, and should not be the main reason you get the game. Basically you get to move Styx around in a stealth mode and based on proximity to enemies you de-stealth.  Its only useful before combat starts, and you only want to engage in it if you want to thin out your enemies before a fight.\n\nOverall is it worth spending your money on it? Yes, it thoroughly entertained me, and lasted me a good couple of days of play. The combat is very well implemented and will keep you trying new combinations of attacks and strategies. Rage is the most fun thing to use in the game.\nThe story leaves a lot wanting, I wanted to see a lot more fantasy clichés being turned on their heads, Elves and Dwarves were barely present in the game, and when they did appear I was more than underwhelmed. They were presented in a manner that was supposed to get the player disgusted with the enemy that is usually portrayed as cool in most media. But it’s the difference between fighting a mustache twirling villain and someone you could argue is an anti-hero. It makes you feel a lot more accomplished.","November 27, 2013","true","11.3"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

It has a very captivating world with a pretty good mythology, and the two main characters are among the most memorable in any recent game I've played. The relationship between Arkhail and Styx feels very genuine —you really get to care about those two.\n\nThe downside: The combat system is quite a bit loose, the AI is stupid. The combat mechanics consist in pausing, choosing targets, queueing attacks and abilities, and constantly switching between Arkhail and Styx, making sure their actions complement each other. It works for the most part but it's not very refined and you can bump into some pretty frustrating moments as a result. The way certain fights are designed doesn't help too much either, and if you leave the AI to make its own decisions (by only focusing on one character, that is), you'll be screwed most of the time. It's far from being unplayable, but I can see these problems turning off a lot of people.\n\nIt's a flawed game, but a very charming one. Recommended if you think you can get past the somewhat flimsy combat and you don't mind its linear, basic design.","October 3, 2014","true","14.4"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

The warrior has a stun attack with a high chance of being dodged.  The rogue has an attack which prevents the target from dodging for 5 seconds.  Put them together and you feel clever!  This gameplay works, and we've seen it work in other games.  For example, the original Dragon Age had the exact same symbiosis between a rogue and a warrior and it worked great there.  However....\n\nThis is a negative review, but I'll start with the good:\n\n+ Very glad to see some variety in story.  The greenskins as protagonists is an interesting angle.  The story itself is mostly good.\n+ Graphics are decent.\n+ Combat has enough depth to be interesting, with lots of abilities which synnergize with each other to produce new effects.\n\nThe bad:\n- The voice actors sound like they're muddling through lines in a second language.  Worse, it sounds like several of the lines are translated literally from the original french, meaning clever local idioms just become nonsense.\n- Game was obviously written solely with an xbox controller in mind.  When you reach a hill and have to move your mouse back to look 'up', you have to pull it about three mousepadlengths because the Y coordinate has a different sensativity than the X coordinate.  This cannot be changed in the options.\n-Combat is a miserable, stumbling affair.  This is the killer.  If you're skimming, read this part.\nAs I mentioned above, the whole game is about doing clever things with your rogue and warrior TOGETHER.  So you'd assume that, generally, they target the same enemy, right?  Wrong.  Their autotargetting ALWAYS chooses different enemies, so I'm being totally serious when I say 50% of my game time was simply smashing the Q and E keys paging through interminable lists of targets trying to get them to both hit the same guy.  This would be less of a problem if the click selection works, but it doesn't.  The camera is locked 2 feet from the action, usually staring at a wall, and clicking an enemy is just as likely to select the guy 20 meters behind him as it is to select him.\n\nThis is a game about combat in which I like everything except the combat.  The combat is awful.  Can not recommend.","July 18, 2015","false","4.7"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","2"

The controls are a jumbled mess.  Even with autodetect on a Windows 8.1 system, a licensed and perfectly mapped Xbox 360 controller, and a ton of attempts to adjust the controller settings in the game, it is impossible to engineer a fix for this problem on the user side.  I never really got to play the actual game.  I have no save data, no progress, and no controls to use.  I essentially just idly pranced around and tried to open the menu, which was oddly mapped to L3, until I got stuck again.  In fact, the only 2 inputs that were properly mapped were lateral movement and back (left / right on the d-pad and B).  That's literally all that worked properly with the controls.\n\nI honestly would like a refund for being issued an unplayable game, but I'm not likely to receive one.

Can't get two minutes of dialogue without one of the characters dropping an F-bomb, making a poorly veiled innuendo, or saying something downright dumb (and this is especially true of the main characters).  Honestly, they swear like they breathe: heavily and without thinking.  It has a nice basis for a typical adventure sort of plot, a 180 degree twist on the valiant knights crusading against the big green monsters, but that gets lost very readily in the poor dialogue and gratuitously foul language.\n\nI did manage to play long enough to experience the combat system a little despite my poor first impression.  Again, a basis for something good that the developers botched horribly.  In this system, the player presses a button which slows time to a crawl in order to plan moves for a combo which are executed once the player speeds time back up again, which seems like a system that would reward strategy, right?  Guess again.  Combo options are limited essentially to quick swings and power attacks and special attacks that you unlock as you gain experience, but chaining them has no added effects.  Essentially, it's that same as just launching singular attack after singular attack, button mashing without the fun of actually mashing the buttons.  All the while your enemies are hitting you until eventually your character's "rage" builds to a point where you lose all control of him, he rampages off on his own, and gets himself killed.\n\nAfter a point the player gets another character, a goblin, who is supposed to be a witty stealth-type character, which he can switch to (If you haven't guessed, witty he is not).  However, the goblin cannot actually go very far without his big Orc pal (I'm sorry did I imply any sort of depth to character relationships in this game?  That's not there either.  The main characters hated each other and bickered uselessly about very minor things the whole of the time I played) making his stealth absolutely pointless.\n\nIn the end, which was a little more than an hour or so into the game, I just couldn't stand it anymore.  I will never play this again, and I hope none of you readers will make the same mistake and start playing in the first place.","December 11, 2013","false","0.7"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

I had high hopes for this game, the plot sounded cool and the art style was neat. Sadly, that all fades away in the usual generic gameplay that Spider is notorious for... If you are not familar MOST of their games have a very bland clunky slow combat system.. Think the first Witcher game but worse. Another thing that always confuses me in their games especially this one.. Using modern day sayings and off handed curses in a fantasy setting just seems... odd to me. The writing is meh and the combat is blah, I bought this game part of a RPG Bundle and I'm very sad to say that everything in that bundle was pretty bland and I regret spending any money on any of their games. I'd stay away.","October 25, 2014","false","0.3"," 3 of 11 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","3","11","0","2"

"Then why the hell did you buy it?", you ask. Well I fell for the old, "edited screen shots and cinematic only trailers" gag. The game looks awful when actually being played, and the story is no where near as interessting as you may think. Although I have only played fifty minutes of the game; it has already bored me to hell, back and then back to hell again, from which I have not returned.\n\nThe combat is what lets this game fall to the bottom of my pile. The stacked movement system consists of: defence and attack moves. The combat is worse than Kirby's combat, and Kirby doesn't have a damned combat system.\n\nTo conclude this short review/rant, do not buy this game!","November 27, 2013","false","1.3"," 3 of 12 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","3","12","0","0"

The combat system is ok, but a little limited. There were two bigger drawbacks for me.  The character advancement is a little too basic.  You pick up new skills, but don't get to do any customization.  The story is too linear.  I personally prefer a little more of an open world where I can make decisions on what I want to do. Lastly the foul language is overdone.  I don't need to hear the F word 50 times to enjoy the story.","November 1, 2014","false","3.7"," 2 of 11 people (18%) found this review helpful","18","2","11","0","0"

Goood.\n\nNow, in Of Orcs and Men you do the same. The problem is that you play in over-the-shoulder view and you control characters with WASD. It gives you the feeling that you should be able to do some real-time fighting.\nThe fact that your characters can't really do anything on their own, means you have to control all of their moves using slow-motion, in order to survive. So you can't really do real-time fighting.\nThat's biggest thing that bugged me throught the whole game and it made the gameplay not-so-enjoyable..","November 12, 2014","false","14.5"," 1 of 9 people (11%) found this review helpful","11","1","9","0","0"

You are the traditional bad guys in a world where the orcs are actually well spoken individuals.  Characters are quite good.  Constant profanity.  Cutscenes go on forever.\nGameplay is a letdown.  You spend the entire game walking through narrow tunnels/trenches/hallways.  Every now and then you find a open area with a few enemies in it.  Arkail takes the aggro, Styx finishes them off.  Styx can be used to stealth kill a few enemies before the battle begins.  Only in the final, very short chapters does the level design open up to show some very nice artwork, but still you walk along a very narrow path.","January 31, 2015","true","9.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
