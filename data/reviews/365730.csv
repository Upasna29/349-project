It's something I would recommend to fans of classic point n' click adventure games. It's like a cheaper, less funny version of Curse Of Monkey Island, similar cartoony style and dialogue/inventory-based puzzles.\n\nPROS:\n- lots of inventory items to collect\n- lots of characters with fun dialogue\n- lots of areas to explore\n- many clever and mostly fair puzzles\n- wide range of good voice acting\n- it is LOOOONG\n\nCONS:\n- probably too much dialogue overall, even if it is often amusing\n- voice acting probably a bit too diverse (North American, Scottish, English, Middle-Eastern, Spanish, etc. makes things a bit too bizarre at times)\n- also, the main character's voice acting can be very annoying (at least if you're British, like me!)\n- bit of a stupid plot\n- some puzzles are not intuitive at all\n\nBut overall, it's a game I don't think that many adventure-game fans are familiar with, it's always fun to play a little-known game, and it's definitely worth a play if you're a fan of this genre, at least to say you have. Almost certainly you should snap it up in a sale if the chance arises!","November 7, 2015","true","10.1"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","8","8","0","1"
