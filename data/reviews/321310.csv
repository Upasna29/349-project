It has a cluttered, obtrusive and just plain illogical presentation. The graphics are blurry and there's zero gameplay here, except for swimming around watching other fish and creatures and looking at sea life and other objects. It's supposed to be Zen, but you would be better off watching one of those pretty aquarium screensavers or any kind of underwater documentary really.\n\n[Rating: 45/100]","September 29, 2014","false","0.1"," 124 of 135 people (92%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","92","124","135","4","5"

It is horrible. Made by the creators of Air Control, it is just as much of a rip off as it's predecessor. The creators have had the gall to change their name and try for another shot of scamming us out of money that could be better spent on real games.

I was very dissapointed in the quality and the content. Do not buy!","October 26, 2015","false","0.2"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","6","10","0","0"
