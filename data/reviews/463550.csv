There are plenty of powerups drop in each level, the graphics looks great, I like the beats in the soundtracks and the Boss fights is challenging.\n\nThis game works with Steam controller and that is a big plus.","June 5","true","2.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"
