It's not that. It's more akin to Puzzle Fighter. Heck, it is basically Puzzle Fighter except with a few but important rule changes.\n\nThat said, this is a pretty good multiplayer block dropping game, and in an increasingly saturated marketplace there still aren't many of these. It's like puzzle fighter, except with a few rule changes that creates real good push/pull between players: You rack up block clears and combos to create garbage, but the other player will only receive that garbage if it clears four or more blocks. So your opponent can dump 20 garbage blocks on you, but you can recover given that you have a good amount of blocks or a combo to clear.\n\nIt is a little bare, the tournament mode is very simple and it's various endings for each character are only in the form of a few sentences at the end. There isn't a whole lot of visual content to look at, the faux-anime girl style only exists in the character select and backgrounds.\n\nBut what is in the game is very solid and polished. Stacking blobs results in a satisfying squish, effects stand out enough and in such a way that you can read your opponent's status with just your peripheral vision. The music is charming and the sound effects are perfect for this type of game. The rules are simple enough to learn quickly and rewards tactful thinking and working under pressure. Also, since indie games do less of this as time goes on: It works. Everything works. No weird glitches, no unpolished bullcrap to swallow, everything just works.\n\n8/10","February 9","true","2.9"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","0"

Totally worth the small asking price. All the elements are present - great controller options, and tons of variations for customizing gameplay. Lots of options here.\n\nAnd the best part is that it supports up to 8 players at once!!! That is simply unheard of in my book.\n\nIf this is your jam, I whole-heartedly recommend this game, without question.","January 16","true","1.1"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","78","14","18","3","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rafaelmorais/recommended/414370/","rafaelmorais","Rafael M.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rafaelmorais/","444 products in account","Easy to pick up and hard to put down, Raining Blobs is an exciting arcade puzzler like the old Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine (or Puyo Puyo), but better. This game offers six difficulty levels and three different speed levels, along with a solo mode, battle mode (supporting up to eight players) and tournament mode.\n\nTo me, this is the best game in the genre since Super Puzzle Fighter II (1996), and I like how friendly or brutal it can be. Also, it's worth mentioning that there's a colorblind option, making the game accessible to everyone.\n\nThe anime appeal is a double-edged sword. I like it (and I'm sure there's a lot of people who'll discover the game because of it), but some people can mistakenly pass the game because of the girls. Either way, it doesn't really matter, since the player will be much more focused on the playfield.\n\nAll in all, I can't recommend Raining Blobs enough if games like Puyo Puyo, Columns, Dr. Mario, and even Tetris, are your cup of tea. For a small asking price, you'll get an addictive and very well made game to play alone and/or with friends - and you can even team up with CPU bots to get the co-op achievements!\n\n10/10","January 19","true","8.4"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

There isn't enough quality puzzle games. Fortunately there is Raining Blob. This puzzle game is made with competition in mind. It's much deeper than Bejewels and Candy Crush. Best of all, it's ideal for playing with friends. 8 players on 1 machine! LOL. I enjoy the pixel art & 16 bit style animated backgrounds.","May 7","true","0.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/recommended/414370/","Steamified","Warwick J.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/","3916 products in account","Raining Blobs marks the Steam debut of talented game developer Endi Milojkoski. The game is one of the brightest and fastest arcade puzzle games to hit Steam in some time.\n\nAlthough the concept of the game is not unique it is definitely one of the best games in its specific genre in years and arguably the very best that the PC has ever had. Games that it compares favorably to include Dr. Robotnik’s Mean Bean Machine which is considered one of the all-time great SEGA games being first released in 1993 on the SEGA Mega Drive, Game Gear and the following year on the Master System, Puyo Puyo and to a lesser extent Columns and Tetris. Game play is extremely addictive as you match blocks of the same color but can only clear them when you connect them to two same-colored blocks with stars in them. It’s not just a game that requires hand-eye coordination but also a quick and strategic mind.\n\nThe game is suitable for one player but you also have the added benefit of playing alongside up to eight other players through the game’s multiplayer. Those who do not have anyone that they can play with are not left out of the game’s competitive mode either as the global leaderboards present enormous challenge to anybody with any desire to compete with the best in the world. It’s the type of game that many players will find themselves trying to claw their way to a higher standing. Even if you’re not such a talented player Milojkoski made the game accessible to everybody by including six difficulty levels. The implementation of a colorblind option further increases the game’s accessibility for the colorblind, an oft-forgotten feature that can render these games unplayable to those who suffer the unfortunate problem. The game makes full use of the Steam platform with achievements, trading cards, the aforementioned Steam global leaderboard system and the Steam cloud. The game is also completely controller friendly.\n\nThe anime fans will delight in the anime art throughout the game but as somebody who isn’t passionate for the interest I found that it didn’t detract me from the game one iota as my brain was too busy concentrating on connecting the colors to take much notice of it.\n\nUnless you’re simply not a fan of arcade puzzle fan there is absolutely no reason why you shouldn’t purchase Raining Blobs. At under $10 it is certain to be enjoyed by most gamers.\n\nFor similar reviews and our daily giveaways please visit http://www.steamified.com/","January 22","true","6.7"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

And then you can fight in teams and that's just great.\n\nAbove that the developer is polishing the game and adding new things with every update, you can set your own rules, etc, Just read the updates and you'll see what you got and what you can expect.","May 2","true","10.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

If you are a fan of games like Tetris, Dr. Mario, Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine, then this could easily be one of your new favorite games.

(Unless you actually have a lot of friends...) And there are a lot of rules to play around with that can make it range from super intense and crazy action, to slower and more relaxed play.\n\nThe developer is also really cool and you can tell there's a lot of love that went into and continues to go into making this game.

It feels like a combination of Tetris and Dr. Mario but it adds it's own setup to give it its own feel.\n\nThe game is competitive in nature and features gameplay for up to 16 players (8 Humans and 8 AI players) so it's great for some intense couch co-op gameplay.\n\nThere's also a tournament mode where you battle your way through each of the game's 8 characters until you defeat the boss Enya. A new mode called Puzzle Mode was released the day we released our review as well.\n\nThe game is an excellent addition to the overcrowded puzzle game genre and if there's one game in the endless sea of puzzle games that you should try out, it's Raining Blobs.\n\nWe gave the game 4.5 Stars out of 5 and since we enjoyed the game quite a bit we're giving it our recommendation here on Steam as well.\n\nWe also recorded a gameplay video which you can find below.
