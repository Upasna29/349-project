"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RandarkCGC/recommended/346430/","RandarkCGC","Randark","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RandarkCGC/","270 products in account",""Spectrum is game set on the pages of a comic book. This comic book is the most boring comic on the face of the planet. Generic colored floating rock after different colored generic floating rock occupy the pages. You jump from platform to platform while changing color to match what you want to touch. Some platforms have walls that you can walk through when you don’t match the color. Others have walls the same color as the platform, forcing you to flip colors twice in one jump. As you progress more colors are added, portals are introduced, and the story drags on. Occasionally, there are enemies in your way. You can only avoid these enemies, there is no way to kill them. And sometimes you are chased through the level, forcing you to make changes fast that you normally would. These were the only parts of the game there were exciting. Spectrum has large number of save spots, you can practice small sections of the game until you get the button combinations just right and then move on."\n\nFull review at  http://opnoobs.com/reviews/spectrum.php","August 24, 2015","false","0.6"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","5","8","0","2"
