There are some tech issues in joining a match lobby and Devs are working on it and on keyboard controls and further customization. Now is the game good at basic? I think yes. It has potential to be very good and is even now quite fun and I fear addictive. Its Combat arcade meets RPG Fantasy. A Mortal Kombat or Street Fighter in fiery pits of hell and fighters from fantasy epics meets survival. Its simply a fun multiplayer combat game set in RPG mould. I found it simply fun and addictive. Even at early stage its deeply satisfying. Menu is simple and easy to follow. Graphics is quite good. Its a dog eat dog ruthless world. The environment, the players everyone or everything is your enemy. You don't just have to beat the enemy players in rapid deathmatches or the Bosses that jump in simply to kill all, you have to survive also the hostile environment while trying to stay alive and thats both challenging and fun. There are no friends here or even temporary allies to face bigger enemies. You are on your own all the time and anything that can move will certainly kill you. Between friends this will be a kind of extremely fun vs mode, if you are bored of shooting folks down or sniping them in normal vs games. Have fun guys! I look forward to playing this more in coming days.","May 30, 2015","true","2.1"," 23 of 29 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","23","29","0","4"

Good GFX. That said, once I got to play a few rounds i think it was awesome fun and can be a great hangout for friends who want a new flavor in deathmatches. Kill each other, kill big bosses and try to top the round at same time even as the maps can make you do suicide if you don't watch out. Layers of challenge and all fast paced. It can only get better.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/maximumslothfulness/recommended/274620/","maximumslothfulness","Maximum Sloth","http://steamcommunity.com/id/maximumslothfulness/","618 products in account","Early Access Review\n\n**Edited 9/18/2015\n\nI would like to start this review by commending the Development Team for being extraordinarily involved with the community and quite friendly. I asked a question before purchasing the game and the creator of Skara The Blade Remains, cromlech_, responded in a detailed and helpful manner. He then proceeded to invite me to his friend list and took the time to chat with me about my opinion regarding the game. This Dev team seems to be trying really hard to engage the community, be transparent, and take all of our suggestions to heart, and it's wonderful. For anyone interested in Q&A about the game etc., I recommend asking on the forums about when there will be Dev streams on Twitch. After the Q&A they will also be playing the game, so you can watch live footage straight from the Devs. See the TL;DR at the bottom for a short summary of my review.\n\nNow, for the actual review- which I will likely edit as I play more of the game, play more characters, and as the game evolves:\n\nAs you would have likely noted, this game just released in a true Alpha state rather recently(about 3-4 months ago). Currently, since the announcement of true alpha, there has been at least one update a month; the last two updates added a playable tutorial, some new skills, bug fixes, implementation of suggestions by the community such as keybinding etc., This game is still in early Alpha - and I repeat, IT IS EARLY ALPHA. Do not expect a fully fleshed out game yet. The framework is there, and it looks quite promising. It will be free to play in the future, so if you would like to wait until its full release to play, then by all means, please do so. That being said, right now your job if you purchase this game is to test current balance between characters, test maps and game systems, and make suggestions on how to improve the game - because the Devs will listen and almost always respond.\n\nGeneral Gameplay - This game has a ton of potential and will be ludicrously fun once all the features are implemented. Right now there are 3 maps, one for each game mode, with plans for more. Some have lava(fall in it and you die) and levers that activate certain map effects. For example, in one map there's a ring in the center that gives way if you hit the lever and this leads to you, or your enemy, tumbling down into a pit of lava. There's also a huge boss-like monster that arises from within the depths of an arena. Currently this monster is an NPC and will attack every player that comes near it - players get extra points for hitting and killing it. A clever player could just stand back as his/her feeble opponents attempt to battle it..and pick them off as they back away in horror. Alas, you will respawn after perishing..so find solace in that.\n\nThere are 3 game modes. Team deathmatch, free for all, and duel. They are fairly self-explanatory. - I will update this section further the more I play, if I notice any notable deviations.\n\nEach character, as you level up, has a set of skills the player can pick. Hold down RT or RB on the gamepad to execute said skills. Shinse has a skill that makes her invisible for a short period of time, and a teleportation ability that switches the player's position with that of his/her target. Also, the devs recently added an ability called, "forest wind," basically you can dash forward in a straight line, damaging any opponents in your path. They also added 1 new skill for the other two currently playable characters, which you can unlock through progressing(leveling up). There are plans to add passive skills and more primary skills.\n\nThere will be a store where you can buy costumes and weapons with in-game currency as well. These costumes will modify stats.\n\nThere will be daily quests/missions, factions, gems to modify stats and more in the future. There are placeholders available for them in game already, but they haven't been implemented yet.\n\nFor new players - There is a playable tutorial right after you create your first character. It explains basic attack, movement, and how to utilize your special attacks. You'll also be able to test out your skills at the end of the tutorial against a few AI opponents.\n\nMost of the above systems are fairly barebones at the moment, because, well, it's an early alpha. Once they become more fleshed out, the game will have far more depth. I say that to warn the people expecting some kind of fully fleshed out product, in the hopes that the people purchasing the game will do so knowing that they are helping develop it with their suggestions et al.,\n\nCombat Gameplay - Each character utilizes a string based on heavy/light attacks. I use an Xbox 360 gamepad so this would be RB and RT. I have played Shinse, thus far. She is a quick assassin-like character.  Her attacks feel appropriately light and heavy depending on what combination of attacks utilized, and they also look nice. Each character can also throw projectiles, a limited number, per life using the A button. Blocking is here too, but blocking attacks drains stamina - and you do NOT want your stamina drained or your block broken as you will be brutally punished by the AI or other players. That being said, the AI so far is kind of placeholder - For example, if you stealth as Shinse the AI will just stand there until you appear again. The last of the controls I will mention here is the "dodge" ability(B on the gamepad), which effectively...dodges. How effective the dodge is depends on your character - some of the heavy characters are a bit slower to dodge.\n\nThe devs also added 3 new abilities - one for each class, so far I have tried Shinse's out and it is mapped to the X button(again, using a 360 gamepad) by default.\n\nGraphics - The game is optimized fairly well for an early alpha, though with recent updates the optimization seems to have gotten a bit worse. That being said, I experienced no notable system lag with all settings maxed. It looks really nice too. I realize "nice" is a vague descriptor, but it's the best I have. To put it another way- this game pleases my ocular orbs.\n\nControls - They are quite responsive. There doesn't seem to be any noticeable input lag. This game does have gamepad (360/Xbox) support as well as keyboard support. The developer has implemented keybindings with update 0.5.3.\n\nCommunity/Online - You'll likely match up against the creative developer and creator of the game if you try out the online. Sadly, the community is fairly small at the moment and you may fight exclusively bots a majority of the time. I hope this changes in the future because these guys deserve both your support and your input as both will help make this game great.\n\nSo if the game is so early, why do I recommend it? Well, because I really like how involved the Developer is with the community, it shows supreme potential that I have no doubt will be met, and as a barebones early alpha, it's actually pretty fun!\n\nTL;DR - Right now you're buying into an early alpha, with an established framework(meaning there's stuff there, like characters, some maps to fight on etc., but it's basic at the moment. Many features still have to be implemented), to help test out balance, make suggestions for improvements, and support the developer. That being said, it's only a $5 buy-in, and it is indeed fun even at this early stage of development. ^_^","July 8, 2015","true","1.6"," 19 of 26 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","19","26","0","0"

Blocking is here too, but blocking attacks drains stamina - and you do NOT want your stamina drained or your block broken as you will be brutally punished by the AI or other players. That being said, the AI so far is kind of placeholder - For example, if you stealth as Shinse the AI will just stand there until you appear again. The last of the controls I will mention here is the "dodge" ability(B on the gamepad), which effectively...dodges. How effective the dodge is depends on your character - some of the heavy characters are a bit slower to dodge.\n\nThe devs also added 3 new abilities - one for each class, so far I have tried Shinse's out and it is mapped to the X button(again, using a 360 gamepad) by default.\n\nGraphics - The game is optimized fairly well for an early alpha, though with recent updates the optimization seems to have gotten a bit worse. That being said, I experienced no notable system lag with all settings maxed. It looks really nice too. I realize "nice" is a vague descriptor, but it's the best I have. To put it another way- this game pleases my ocular orbs.\n\nControls - They are quite responsive. There doesn't seem to be any noticeable input lag. This game does have gamepad (360/Xbox) support as well as keyboard support. The developer has implemented keybindings with update 0.5.3.\n\nCommunity/Online - You'll likely match up against the creative developer and creator of the game if you try out the online. Sadly, the community is fairly small at the moment and you may fight exclusively bots a majority of the time. I hope this changes in the future because these guys deserve both your support and your input as both will help make this game great.\n\nSo if the game is so early, why do I recommend it? Well, because I really like how involved the Developer is with the community, it shows supreme potential that I have no doubt will be met, and as a barebones early alpha, it's actually pretty fun!\n\nTL;DR - Right now you're buying into an early alpha, with an established framework(meaning there's stuff there, like characters, some maps to fight on etc., but it's basic at the moment. Many features still have to be implemented), to help test out balance, make suggestions for improvements, and support the developer. That being said, it's only a $5 buy-in, and it is indeed fun even at this early stage of development. ^_^","July 8, 2015","true","1.6"," 19 of 26 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","19","26","0","0"

There aren't even NPC to interact with.\nCombat controls are subpar - weapons do not work like their real-world counterparts.\nIf you try to host an arena-match, you will be fast dissapointed as the controls are not explained to you, and the NPCs all attack/stun you to repeated death.\n\nThis game is in a severe alpha and is in need of massive improvement.\n","December 25, 2014","false","3.1"," 21 of 31 people (68%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","68","21","31","2","0"

You will have in your hands the power to enhance a fighting VS game, from the very beggining.\n\nThe devs are working hard to give us info so we can work. They encourage us to give our feedback, they listen and they will do EVERYTHING in their hands to implement it if most of the community wants it.\n\nThe game right now is at is core. Still, it has a great source (Unreal 4 i think). Thats gives the game some nice graphics. The mechanics need to be polished, but thats why we are here.\n\nThey really work under 2 basis: Skara is OUR game, meaning this: We will contribute a lot for the game, in this state and even when released. And: Trust your skills, not your Stats, meaning this game will aim to be a skilled game, and, in the future, maybe an E-Sport, where nothing is left to luck.\n\nThe amount you pay for the game, will be compensated in the future with in-game currency and some things. So, you dont loose your money, you just contribute from earlier (Wich is needed, given their nature as Indie developers).\n\nIm really engaged with the development of this game.

Yes, the game is incredibly rough if you consider the devs' ambition, but, seeing the amount of polish put into the game in this one update (i.e. there were no options at all and now there are enough to (maybe) satisfy most (for now)), I am incredibly hopeful. If you approach the game at face-value - as an arena fighter - you, too, will no doubt see only potential and spread the word that "Hey, there's something to this game."\n\n[[I am friends with one of the dev's because they friended me after I posted in a discussion, where I complained (before this latest update) that I couldn't play the game. He reassured me that a new update would be coming soon that should take care of it. Skara is, at the moment, an arena fighter, capable of supporting single player versus bots, but meant for PvP. My endorsing of the game might seem like advertisement I was paid to do. It is not. It is simply my recognizing that without a community, Skara could go nowhere. I want this game to be successful. *spreadin' the word*]]\n\nSkara definitely seems like a prime example of Early Access done right - invest in the game and watch it get better and better. Currently there are three maps and two characters with three different Armors/Skins (one of these cosmetics is "Coming Soon"). The basics of the fighting system are pretty well done; Skara is not a button-masher, so be decisive in doing what you do (the only complaint that I have with the controls is that the Lock-On (using a controller) seems unresponsive at times) - this is to say that if you get your fighter into a combo, there really doesn't seem to be a way to cancel out of it. Rolling might work, but the camera (whether you're locked-on to an enemy or not) seems to get locked, or at least stiffened, while you're in a combo too.\nPlaying as the Gladiator, I get destroyed by the Assassin, who is much quicker and can teleport (not necessarily hinting that there is a balance issue, because I really think the game is pretty polished thus far - except maybe the fighting being a little too stiff(?)).\n\n(Perhaps too) Optimistic (that word usually goes as well with Tynon as "cold" goes with "fire," so hopefully that's a good testament), I think that there is zero chance of Skara being perverted into a bad game that disappoints. The developers truly want to make a great game; they are eager to play with people who post "Multiplayer game with no players?" just waiting for that word of mouth to help Skara take off. With devs as invested as these, yeah, Skara will be big.\n\n\nEDIT: To clarify my "the fighting [is] a little too stiff" comment: Having played the game further, I now have a better feel for what exactly Skara is.\n\nIt is a deliberate, basic fighter.\nTo elaborate:\nHave you ever been playing a fighting game and just could not reckon it? There're the 88-fingered wiz's and there are those with, er, an eidetic muscle memory. Thus, there are those who mash buttons in the hope of achieving some awesome combo and there are those who attempt to memorize specific combo's (no doubt just to mix them up and fail).\n\nSkara is a deliberate, basic fighter. Though it could be argued that in those other fighting games you've only yourself to blame if you're not good - I think, in that case, it's either a lack of will or manual dexterity. In Skara, it is ONLY up to your ability to anticipate and react. There are no 4-line long combos. There are no cheap Hadoken techniques. So if you're not good at Skara, it's either because of lag in hand-eye coordination or because you're approaching it wrong...\n\nMy complaining that the combat might be too stiff was misinformed. I was expecting some sort of flighty fighter; Skara is more akin to a heavy-weight chess match. You really do have to plan and counter with the quickness - it's hard (if even possible) to cancel actions so as to reinforce this: If you make a mistake, you will pay.\n\nSo. If a game of pure skill is what you're after, as opposed to games in which a certain Champion has this one power they keep spamming / a certain Killstreak keeps decimating you / a certain tactic is abused, rendering the game a "Wait out the clock for inevitable defeat because there's no defense from that"...\n\nSkara - The Blade Remains","March 1, 2015","true","6.3"," 10 of 17 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","10","17","0","0"

My endorsing of the game might seem like advertisement I was paid to do. It is not. It is simply my recognizing that without a community, Skara could go nowhere. I want this game to be successful. *spreadin' the word*]]\n\nSkara definitely seems like a prime example of Early Access done right - invest in the game and watch it get better and better. Currently there are three maps and two characters with three different Armors/Skins (one of these cosmetics is "Coming Soon"). The basics of the fighting system are pretty well done; Skara is not a button-masher, so be decisive in doing what you do (the only complaint that I have with the controls is that the Lock-On (using a controller) seems unresponsive at times) - this is to say that if you get your fighter into a combo, there really doesn't seem to be a way to cancel out of it. Rolling might work, but the camera (whether you're locked-on to an enemy or not) seems to get locked, or at least stiffened, while you're in a combo too.\nPlaying as the Gladiator, I get destroyed by the Assassin, who is much quicker and can teleport (not necessarily hinting that there is a balance issue, because I really think the game is pretty polished thus far - except maybe the fighting being a little too stiff(?)).\n\n(Perhaps too) Optimistic (that word usually goes as well with Tynon as "cold" goes with "fire," so hopefully that's a good testament), I think that there is zero chance of Skara being perverted into a bad game that disappoints. The developers truly want to make a great game; they are eager to play with people who post "Multiplayer game with no players?" just waiting for that word of mouth to help Skara take off. With devs as invested as these, yeah, Skara will be big.\n\n\nEDIT: To clarify my "the fighting [is] a little too stiff" comment: Having played the game further, I now have a better feel for what exactly Skara is.\n\nIt is a deliberate, basic fighter.\nTo elaborate:\nHave you ever been playing a fighting game and just could not reckon it? There're the 88-fingered wiz's and there are those with, er, an eidetic muscle memory. Thus, there are those who mash buttons in the hope of achieving some awesome combo and there are those who attempt to memorize specific combo's (no doubt just to mix them up and fail).\n\nSkara is a deliberate, basic fighter. Though it could be argued that in those other fighting games you've only yourself to blame if you're not good - I think, in that case, it's either a lack of will or manual dexterity. In Skara, it is ONLY up to your ability to anticipate and react. There are no 4-line long combos. There are no cheap Hadoken techniques. So if you're not good at Skara, it's either because of lag in hand-eye coordination or because you're approaching it wrong...\n\nMy complaining that the combat might be too stiff was misinformed. I was expecting some sort of flighty fighter; Skara is more akin to a heavy-weight chess match. You really do have to plan and counter with the quickness - it's hard (if even possible) to cancel actions so as to reinforce this: If you make a mistake, you will pay.\n\nSo. If a game of pure skill is what you're after, as opposed to games in which a certain Champion has this one power they keep spamming / a certain Killstreak keeps decimating you / a certain tactic is abused, rendering the game a "Wait out the clock for inevitable defeat because there's no defense from that"...\n\nSkara - The Blade Remains","March 1, 2015","true","6.3"," 10 of 17 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","10","17","0","0"

With what's available on this game i don't agree with the price if it was 1/4th of the price and each arena was a $5 add on that might make sense.\n\nBut I bought a $20 game and no one to play with me or to battle.\n\nI give this a recommend though because I think these guys are onto something good though.

Lack of resolution options and questionable optimization can make for a sour experience but the development team needs worthwhile consumer input and constructive help to fully realize the game.

That's awesome.\n\nBut returning to the current game: I had a good time, played probably 4 or 5 matches, 3 of which took place with others. Lag wasn't a huge problem on my end (I know that's usually a hard issue for Early Access games to handle) and I really REALLY enjoyed playing with other players. The bots however aren't easy.

Unfortunately this game has failed to catch my attention as it is an Arena game, in an Arena game players JUST fight each other inside an arena and that is it. It is a good bid because most gamers nowadays use consoles and the personal computer is NOT on their wishlist (just speculating but it might have something to do with having to think when having a computer while having a console you just need to know how to turn it on), so if you want to make a quick buck on the console market this might work. I am an extremely complicated person and I LOVE a challenge in complete contrast to most players who are just looking to let off some steam. In a perfect world this game would be more about using the flow of movement to defend or attack an opponent, just look at fight scenes in every movie you've ever seen where the hero is fighting with EVERYTHING available to him/her. Using elbows, knees, shield and staff end of a spear and much more. Now if there is any way to implement this kind of detailed fighting THEN I would certainly look into this game once again but for now it is MAINLY a game for consoles and it doesn't peak my interest.","May 8, 2015","false","0.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","2"

I decided to just join a match, 2 games where running, each playing the LOBBY gamemode, with 1 player each and -1 ping, my game froze for an odd minute or so then when i tried to join one of these games i was greeted by a black screen, five minutes later and still nothing, i closed the game and gave it another shot and nothing changed. and third time is not the charm, tried hosting a game and this time i was left to some lovely art and nothing more.\n\nThis is not a game that should be purchasable, i personally got it in a humble bundle so I'm not too upset, but this game is just nothing, im sure maybe the combat is fairly redeeming, but the game is t incomplete to let you access the combat, and indie multiplayer only games are always a terrible investment and never relaly a good buy, because there is never anybody palying which will make the game unplayable, literally unplayable\n","December 23, 2014","false","0.1"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

I don't think solely online games like this should be released without a lot of advertisement.  The actual gameplay is fine, but even on the lowest graphic settings, my computer simply can't handle the game, despite the fact that the graphics are somewhat comparable to Dynasty Warriors, a game that purposefully uses lower end graphics to have a lot of characters on screen on a time.  What is using up all of this?\n\nThe game is kinda fun on its own, but I honestly can't recommend this game to you unless you have friends who are willing to get on at the same time.  And since not everyone has this luxury, there are some people who simply can't play the game with other people.","June 19, 2015","false","13.3"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","8","15","0","0"

Then the game put me through 3 screens of image tutorials and popped me straight into a game! I want to ajust my settings and found out two things, the game doesn't bother to pause itself when I go into my options and there are about 3 options in visuals to pick from anyway! When I returned to the match It was pathetic, all you do is likk a bot in an area in pathetic fights with the action of watching ants move leaves to their nest. All the game is is fighting easy bots. I went to find a menu, opening options and clicking "Main menu" I was taken back to the tutorial and sent back into a game again which was still just fighting a bot!

Once I had the chance to try it, I saw why everyone was reinforcing the "Early Access" Label. It is an Early Access release, but while it seems to still need a lot of work it also has good potential and has some fairly active developers - so it seems promising to follow.\n\nThe game is an FFA/DM multiplayer arena fighter with a neat collaborative boss to fight at the end (so far only available in one particular level - I suspect the other levels will also have a collaborative boss eventually).\n\nGraphically, the game has the effects and character design and landscaping of a promising game; it's really pretty. My immediate thoughts from previews and screenshots was actually reminiscent of Vindictus by Nexon/DevCat - the theme and scale feels similar in some ways and I rather liked that.\n\nThe animations and mechanics still feel a bit clunky and restrictive of the player's options to adapt to a fight. A lot of the attack options you have are very linear and in-flexible and you can't intentionally interrupt them very well without cancelling the attack entirely. Additionally, once you are beyond a certain point into the attack animation, you kind of lose control of your character (so if your attack missed, you basically become fodder for spam attacks from the swarming bots as your character slowly recovers from the attack cool down).\n\nAfter a lot of practice, you might finally familiarize with enough of the animation procedures and timing mechanics to be somewhat effective in battle (or maybe discover an exploit similar to how the bots can spam you once you are knocked down) - however it feels more like a game about timing events based on your familiarity with particular model animations still. It doesn't feel oriented around counter attacking or flexible and dynamic attacks.\n\nThe male character has a clear advantage using a spear/polearm for their fast attack that easily outranges the dagger fast attack of the female character. Sure the female character can throw daggers and use a charge attack, however both have larger vulnerabilities and skill requirements that make them less effective than the ranged fast attack of the spear. I mentioned "[exploiting mechanics to win]" and that was the first one I quickly discovered and relied on.\n\nThe Arenas are rather big, but not entirely purposeful during fights yet. Once you are in a conflict with a bot, the rest of the Arena outside of attack range is just space that you are not using (unless you manage to dodge and sprint away, but even still that doesn't give the arena's scale much purpose)\n\n------------\n\nLike everyone says, it's still in Early Access. It does look like it has potential, but in it's current state it's very hard for me to recommend it yet as enjoyably playable. However, I would recommend following it as development progresses.\n\nIf I could make one request, it would be to expand the graphical settings to be more advanced. I had to play on low quality settings because one of the effects that automatically kicks on from Medium and higher quality consistently plays at nearly the same, very low fps. I suspect it's V-sync or aliasing maybe. Either way, it would be nice to break down the graphical settings to be more customizeable so I don't need to sacrifice all the other graphical features because of one or two particular settings not workign well on my GPU.","February 20, 2015","false","4.6"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","2"

If you expect to play it on a laptop, better it would be some high end gaming laptop since my Lenovo Y50 couldn't handle it either, even though that it's classified as a gaming laptop.\n\nOn a side note, in the loading screen there is a blatant lie, stating that "just mashing buttons won't do the job!". Unfortunately it will, from my experience you can simply auto target random bot or even player and then, the one which thinks least and mashes buttons most emerges victorious, also a simple strategy is just doing some button bashing combo rendering opponent stun-locked and bit by bit knocking him back until he falls off the ledge.","September 27, 2015","false","0.6"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

If you expect to play it on a laptop, better it would be some high end gaming laptop since my Lenovo Y50 couldn't handle it either, even though that it's classified as a gaming laptop.\n\nOn a side note, in the loading screen there is a blatant lie, stating that "just mashing buttons won't do the job!". Unfortunately it will, from my experience you can simply auto target random bot or even player and then, the one which thinks least and mashes buttons most emerges victorious, also a simple strategy is just doing some button bashing combo rendering opponent stun-locked and bit by bit knocking him back until he falls off the ledge.","September 27, 2015","false","0.6"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

(Real trouble is in the tutorial when you first encounter with the enemy)\n\nSo this game is about dying... Combat is really slow. The most difficult character (I think it's not difficult) is a stealth assassin, what include a bit faster combat but It's slow too... There's 3 available character in this game right now. Playing with all of them is great, but everyone of them are slow. By the way, combat and other things in this game is very interesting.\n\nGraphicsThis game is REALLY nice.

In no way am I saying that this is how I'll feel in the future. As it develops there is a chance that I could change my stance on the game. So in saying that let's get into it.\n\nCurrently I don't feel I can say this game is very good. There are certainly nice things going for it but not nearly enough. The game has a decent concept, though not the most original around. And it looks nice enough and the only reason to bash it is if you're a graphics wh*re. But that is about where the good stops.\n\nGoing back to the graphics, for what they currently are...the game runs terrible. I by no means have a monster PC but it's well enough that I have run nicer looking games on higher settings with less stability issues. It also seems hit or miss if the game will launch successfully on the first go. The combat, which should be the shining star in this game is the exact opposite. It's sluggish, slow and at times unresponsive. They claim you can't just spam click but with how it's currently designed, you very much can and still be successful. Connecting to a game is also a hair pulling task. It starts with not enough players. So most of the time you're stuck playing with bots or a single dude who has no place hosting with their internet and its a lagfest. No problem, you'll just play with your friend you might say. Good luck. There is no way to create a lobby and have your friends join. It's all just dumb luck and chance one of you gets a lobby instead of joining a random person and then they can manage to find your game via random clicking and crossing their fingers. I could type my life story about the faults but instead I'll link to a video I did talking about further issues that game has below.
