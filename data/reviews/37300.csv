Dinner city is a free online game which is the SAME GENERAL CONCEPT of this game.

I kept wondering why the F$#¨% i bought this thing....\n\nthe Tycoon addition to the name definetly tricked me... but it was the first and only time.. Thx to this game i will always triple check a game if it has Tycoon added to the name....\n\nIts stupid, plain silly. No challenge, yet no chill. Its just sad... seriously dont buy this think "oh manage a restaurant type o ♥♥♥♥" nope nope, its more like a celphone game, clicky clicky type of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ crap.\n\nIf i got this game for free i would seriously sue the mofuc&*&","August 31, 2014","false","1.8"," 7 of 16 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","7","16","0","0"

I really put some time into this game making sure that I accomplish all the goals efficiently. Like all Dash games, they have a simple formula but this one in particular shines the most as there is even a silly story to give you that extra motivation to play. Great for all ages!","November 30, 2013","true","0.1"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","3","9","0","0"
