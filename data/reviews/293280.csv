I've played all kinds of MMOs, and one focused on pure exploration sounded like a lot of fun. This game makes an admirable attempt at delivering that, but there are too many immersion breaking bugs to really enjoy it.\n\nI love the way the game looks. I like the lack of a HUD. I'm fine with no combat, no quests, no loot, etc. Call it a multiplayer walking simulator if you like, but I think the no pressure approach is an enjoyable break from the addictive grinding of the typical WoW-style game. There's great potential here.\n\nUnfortunately, I've encountered a number of bugs in the brief time I've played that have hampered my enjoyment. After logging out and then returning, I'm now stuck in third-person view instead of first person. The graphics settings reverted to default too. There's a distracting amount of texture pop-in. Movement is clunky. The controls are unclear, and aren't shown anywhere (which means no keybind settings either). But the worst was trying to use the language drawing.\n\nYou see, the only way you have of communicating with other players is by drawing word pictures. There are stones throughout the game that teach you how to draw the words, including the order of the strokes, which matters for getting the word right. Precision matters too, making it easy to get the words wrong. Worse, on the third word I found ("near"), I couldn't get it right until I figured out that the stone was showing the strokes in the wrong order!\n\nSo, anyway, that's my first impressions review. Hopefully they patch this stuff soon, because I think this could be a great game. For now, I'll try it a little bit longer to see if it grows on me, but I can't in good conscience recommend it.\n\nEdit: After giving it more thought, I decided to ask for a refund for this game (which has been granted). The unfortunate day-one experience left a bad taste in my mouth, and as a result I don't have any enthusiasm for sticking with this through the bug-fix process.","June 4, 2015","false","3.1"," 190 of 211 people (90%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","90","190","211","3","2"

What if we took away chat, levels, killing things, and quests? What would we be left with? How would players communicate? What would they do? It's actually a really neat idea and I'm glad someone conducted the experiment. In ideal play, you would run into other players and use an in-game sign language to communicate what you would like to do including some tricky achievements.\n\nInstead of a list of pros and cons, I'll just post a list of hopes:\n\nHopes for the Devs:\nStay encouraged and now that you've built a game and released it to market - think about what you can do better and put out an awesome next game. Y'all have some serious talent when it comes to graphics, voice overs, and atmosphere.\nLower the price to free or just above free. Nobody should be paying the same for this game and ARK\nI suspect y'all are millenials. Hire a Gen-X or Baby Boomer to round out your team. They will point out the blind spots.\nThink about adding in what you've taken out (chat, quests, killing, etc) but in a special way that stays true to your vision. Reconstructing what has been deconstructed.\nGo 100% into VR. Whether on HTC Vive or Oculus Rift - huge potential here!\nI'm cheering for you. Rooting for you. Love the glimpse of talent. I'm looking forward to writing a positive review on your next game.","June 22, 2015","false","11.9"," 103 of 117 people (88%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","88","103","117","4","1"

Wander wasn't just a swing in the dark for a quick cash grab, it was a notion with all of the conceptual dominoes ready to be knocked down. An MMO with a focus on environment and exploration as opposed to combat. They say that when someone loses their sight, all of their other senses get stronger. That isn't the case with Wander. It's as if they made an MMO with a world, NPCs, and combat, then just removed the NPCs and combat and called it a day. There was so many opportunities to make this game an interesting piece of work without the crutch of combat and violence, that were also thrown away at every turn.\n\nEvery building is empty. Nothing worth noting. Imagine this game where there is a sprawling population, people to meet and to go on quests with. This doesn't demand the idea of combat, it just demands the idea of objective. Wander is based on a safari jungle, so why not have an encyclopedia worth of animals to discover and watch? An incredible depth of species and organisms to research. Wander could have had that and much more, but instead it doesn't have much of anything.\n\nYou cannot directly communicate with players. Wander has its own language, Rozdha, which can be learned by coming across stones that teach you one word at a time. To have a real conversation with a fellow player, you would have both needed to spend countless hours learning and remembering these words. There is no encyclopedia, so if you're not recording the notions yourself, good luck. It would've been great if there were ways to communicate with other players, but Rozhda could be used to access hidden or specific content. That'd be great because it'd influence exploration and flesh the world and objectives out a bit.\n\nWander is underdeveloped. Bugs litter the game, and texture popping happens more than appreciated with it being a visually-focused game. Even without the bugs, the previous reasons are why this game truly falters.\n\nOur medium is interesting. There is a thriving mobile market based on the idea of copying others to make a quick buck. Yet, that's not Wander did. They cropped up a simply amazing concept, with the potential of excellence, and dropped it like an egg. I personally hope they either revert this game into early access, or someone takes their idea and fleshes it out like it deserves.\n\n\nHere is a video review from me if you're interested in seeing more: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YMgecmdNT4","June 6, 2015","false","2.4"," 64 of 77 people (83%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","83","64","77","4","0"

People say it's terrible because of its bugs but in all honesty, it's a game still being worked on as I write this review. The developers are one of the most dedicated game devs I have ever seen and are devoted to satisfying their customers, hearing out what people have to say and most importantly they care about what me and others as individuals have to say about the game so long as it isn't childish bashing like i've seen most of the negative reviews based on with a few decent ones mixed in.\n\nPros of Wander:\n-Stunning atmosphere, really makes you feel immersed in the game\n-Its constantly being updated\n-Neat lore and a different gamestyle which is unique and stays true to the name Wander in the gameplay\n-Not many goals, you just sit back, relax and enjoy the scenery and the game\n-You can be four characters, all of which are well programmed into the game\n-Neat and realistic sound affects\n-Developers listen to the community\n-Many different sceneries to wander to such as a floating island, the bottom of the ocean and the oceanic runes, the caves and the cultural tribe areas\n-Each character has it's own environments and differences from the others\n-Relaxing open world game for those who get tired of games that have so much going on in them that makes it stressful and Wander has so much content with so little guidelines that you do whatever you want when you want.\n-Has multiplayer so you can wander with other people\n-Has neat loading in soundtracks\n\nCons of Wander:\n-Characters lack landscape centering. (Ex: Climbing a hill as an Azertash will have your back feet in the air like so.\n-Has its fair share of bugs as does any game.\n-Lacking a few textures in some areas in the terrain\n-Griffin has too slow of a dive speed and too slow of an upward flight\n-Oren's tree branches take up too much of the screen\n-Difficult to find other players\n-Textures take too long to load into view\n\nAll in all it's got cons to match the pros, but I just wanted to say that for some people this game is for you, and for others you may prefer your shooter games. It depends on what you like and if you're open to trying out new things. I'd recommend this game just because it really is stunning to enjoy a slow paced game with lots to offer. If you have an issue with a bug, you can make a topic on it and I guarantee you that someone, if not the Wander team themself will answer it and will look towards fixing the bug. It's costly, but for good reason. It's the perfect game for you if every game you play is either frustrating, painstakingly boring or if you like what you've seen on the store page. It's different, yes but in a good way. This has my vote.","September 9, 2015","true","14.0"," 32 of 42 people (76%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","76","32","42","2","0"

I did read the reviews and thought that at the very least, chasing the achievements should be fun for a game that the reviewers claim "has no content." Surely I'd show them wrong! I like nearly every indie game I've purchased!\n\nI expected to see the gorgeous scenery like in the screenshots.\nNope. There was some nice scenery at times, but it was nowhere near the quality advertised. I expected to find little easter eggs like the lizards. None of that is in this game. There are no other players to be seen. Not sure what gfx card is used to get those screenshots but my GTX 780ti does not cover it. (It does however cover ESO, GTA5 and many other gorgeous games)\n\nMy first few minutes were spent as a tree. With no way to move into first person or change camera angles, this seemed a little non intuitive to me.\n\nMy next few minutes are spent as a human wandering around. A tooltip popped up and said something about map markers. HOLY HELL! DO NOT CLICK M!\nI don't know where I went, but is sure as heck wasn't to place map markers.\nLeft click did nothing, right click did nothing as I frantically waved my mouse around that clearly held a marker in it, but didn't actually place anywhere. I was stuck in this room that showcased an island, had all the "speak runes" in it with no way out. Until I hit M again. Well that was frustrating. Off to go find more little lore tidbits I guess?\n\nThe "speak" ability in the game was just as awful. I'm reminded of a time when I played "Arx Fatalis" where the game was so picky about drawing symbols that it was almost impossible to use. The interface claimed I could just click on a rune or draw it myself, but picking a rune seemed to do nothing. Drawing a rune made me cry as I'm a major in college in the Japanese language and stroke order as well as direction is exceedingly important and this just seems to be in no inherient order.\nWho the heck draws a slash from the bottom and moves up?!\nWhere were you taught to write?! Drawing a circle is just as horrid.\n\nQuick, draw a circle. Did you start from the top and draw it clockwise?\nApparently this game thinks you should start from the right edge and draw it counter clockwise. No damned sense or logic in how drawing the "runes" work.\n\nI jumped from a cliff to find that my character not only had no underwear, but had a void for where her crotch was.\n\nI'm a patient person and I do want a game that highlights exploration and no combat, but this is so far from what I expected, I'm going to agree with my fellow reviewers and say it's not really a game. Do not buy. Do not waste your money. For realz.\n\nDid I mention there's a bug where you have to delte your "user" folder each time you want to play this game or it won't work at all?","July 9, 2015","false","1.1"," 25 of 32 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","25","32","0","2"

Unfortunately, this is not supposed to be a screensaver, it’s supposed to be a game. And gameplay in Wander is scarcer than water in Mad Max.

Right from the beginning I was consumed by the game. It is so beautiful and well designed. Your eyes will constantly look around at this beautiful world. Also the 'creatures' are quite wonderful as well, much detail was given to them. In this open world, the game has a very simple objective. Explore. Spend hours searching the islands for caves, lore stones, and also wander around to discover the language of this majestic world.\n\nEven after a few months of pain stakingly fixing bugs and such the game still has a few. It's not that bad, but the devs are still very active in this game. They give you a lot of their time, spending the day answering questions and most-likely fixing the bugs that still exist in this game. The bugs aren't major things, sometimes the game won't load or you can't ride a Griffin, but eventually these things do work, though I haven't had much luck on riding a Griffin.\n\nOh yes, in this game you can because four 'creatures' which are named; Orin, Griffin, Hira, and Azertash. The Orin form is basically you are a tree. It's some what annoying because your branches tend to cover the entire screen so soon you will want to change forms into something more agile and quick. That form would be the Hira form, which is essentially human form. Third form is the Griffin. So with this form you can fly, you are part hawk, part lion/tiger/leopard (Depending on what rock you use to change into this form). It is amazing to fly above the massive world you can explore, also in this form you can fly to the floating island that levitates in the sky with an amazing waterfall crashing down off of it. The last form is the Azertash which in short is basically a 'water dragon.' It swims in the water with great speed and you can explore the depths of the ocean. It is quite amazing being at the bottom of the ocean, though I wish more effort was put into the folliage down in the depths.\n\nWith these four forms you can explore the world like you've never known. Being able to fly to the heavens or to the depths of the sea. Or you can explore the islands to find hidden caves and secrets. This game is truly beautiful and the great news is that a new update will be out soon.\n\nIn conclusion, if you are someone who enjoys open world, exploration and relaxing games this is something you should look into. I myself do not like stressful games and this one I could play for hours, wandering around aimlessly and taking in this breathless world that I know so little about. It will shock you when you have seemed to explore the whole island that you find something new. The world is huge, and very detailed. So in the end I would definitively Recommend this game.","August 30, 2015","true","27.2"," 27 of 38 people (71%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","71","27","38","5","2"

I exactly got that from that game.\n\nI know that it have some bugs ... yes. I know it dont have fighting system (it is just a explore Game like the developer said so). I KNOW that it had some problems but after 3 days after release they patched it so ... i dont get it WHY THERE ARE SO MANY HATE THERE!!!\n\nI looked at some videos at youtube and all was like "You are so slow."

NO NOOBS! ... NO PROBLEM!\n\nI spend some time there and its better like to sit straight infront of the PC and watch the desctop. I start that game and explore it is very well done. I can understand when some say its nothing ... hey ... thats okay so you are not in there customer list where they want to go.\nIt has a rough start because what i heard the sponsor jumps off. They patched it!\n\nThe only problem i have is after the first time i closed the game and it dont wanted to start.\nJust go to the library where you installed it and delete the "USER" folder. (No worries ... it saved it online and after that your game crashes all the time when you close it. Thats normal then but they try to fix it)\n\nHere i wanted to thank the publisher ... Thank You Twisted Tree!\n\nSadly it was rough for you still ... thanks for that awesome game we can enjoy. No one ever did such a genre or wanted to take the risk and i personally want to thank you for that awesome experience that i can just around ... be a gryphon and fly where ever i want and every time i stand still ... its a screenshot worth.\n\nI hope ... that you dont get demotivated because of the stupid community because they all cant read what they buy and god thanks that i can think for myself and tryed the game out.\n\nTHANK YOU!\n\nI hope some people will read that ... watch a youtube video like me ... turn off the stupid people and just watch that beautiful game and get motivated like me to play this game.\n\nPS: Sadly english isnt my native language but to send you all a message that they patched it and its still a wonderful game i write this article in english. I hope i could show you that it is still a really good game with nice graphics and when you still dont believe me ... watch some youtube videos ... turn off the music and most of the showed bugs they all show is fixed.","August 15, 2015","true","22.9"," 30 of 45 people (67%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","67","30","45","6","0"

(I was getting about ten FPS the entire time and I'm on a new 700$ HP Pav)\nJumping is delayed\nNeeds turning animation/sideways walking animation\nWater speed needs to be a ton faster as well as walking in the lizard form.\nHiro form needs walking animation and maybe different styles(?)\nWalking and running have no momentum build up which makes travelling on narrower surfaces (especially with Hiro) very tricky.\n\nGlitches:\nLizard stone doesn't save in the lore cave even after transforming to it.\nGame teaches me how to use glyphs even after finding multiple words.\nSome of the stairs  and stone platforms leading from the Hiro stone to the Griffin stone are missing Navmesh in areas which is why I fell through them and got stuck a few times.\nSome Glyphs gives me the same words as other ones.\n\nSuggestions:\nAnimal/Hiro NPCs wouldn't be a bad idea\nA global chat option so people can better find eachother.\nI like the idea of using the game's native language, but limited communication is why The Endless Forest isn't very popular.\nDifferent forms? (Would be cool but not required at all)\nUnderwater movement to be a lot more like flying movement.\n\nEven through all of this, I'd still reccommend it, because I think whoever is working on this game has their head screwed on right and is willing to take into consideration some of the suggestions and ideas of the community, and listen to their community, and wanting to make this game better.\nBut for the love of god please give me more frames and further rendering distance and make it an early access.","December 26, 2015","true","4.0"," 20 of 28 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","20","28","0","1"

You can't talk or type to another user other than draw a circle on your screen --- that means "Hello/Goodbye" in stone language.

You can't gather things, hunt things, nothing you can do other than read the stone and the maps are so big you got stuck everywhere.

The introduction to the game was terribly poor, the animations are lacking, and there are numerous bugs still lying about. The option menu didn't even work! Game mechanics, such as writing symbols, were not nearly explained enough tfor me to understand the first part of it and what constitutes a success and a failure. You start as a plodding tree-man for no explicable reason, then turn into a woman and I honestly could not figure out where to go past that. And don't even get me started on the pathetic excuse of a "map" they offered, which I could not exit from or interact with to any significant degree besides looking around. This game should be advertised as being Early Access with how much work needs to be put into it to make it tolerable, let alone good.\nDon't get me wrong, I absolutely adore indie titles and exploration games and I support quite a few Early Access but this is just inexcusable. Nothing in the game justifies the price or the fact that this game isn't considered a work in progress.\nThe idea of an exploration-based online game is fun but it seems that Wander will not scratch that itch, so I suppose I will have to wait till No Man's Sky is released.","January 3","false","0.3"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Every MMO's suffer from bugs at release, but at least you can play until they are fixed. Here, everything is bugged apart movement. Graphics are nice, or they are awfull meaning that some of the game is finished where some seems abandoned. Tons of appealing ideas runied by poor realization as the drawing of words with mouse... Buggy as camera still follows mouse when drawing, making drawing almost impossible. Releasing mouse button, takes too much time to go back to standard behaviour, so it's difficult to know what you are currently doing.\nI fly a giant eagle, cool. Landscape from the sky, horrible. Landing in a forest, impossible to get back of the landed eagle. Used "impossible to move" help button, eagle starts to run here and there whitout succeeding to put me back to the ground. Log off, log in again.  After having learn to turn into a female as seen on the screenshots. Willing to explore, that's the heart of it.

Glitch, bugs, and errors can and DO occur. If you forget this and buy it and start complaining that the game is buggy, well. . .who's fault is that?\n\n-----------------------\n\nATTENTION VIEWER!\n\nDo you want a game where you have to deal with 'levels' and 'fetch quests'? What about dealing with people whining that the game is 'pay to win' or 'bots are everywhere'? Do you like playing the same type of cookie cutter gameplay over and over again? Hotbars, gear stats, cooldowns, and all those hot staples of the early MMO genre?\n\nIf you answered yes to any or all of these things, you can just leave the room right now because this game is NOT for you!\n\nNow, if you've come this far you are either: A) Not interested in the standard 'MMO' type game or B) you like those games but don't like playing five billion of them that are essentially the same.\n\n-----------------------\n\nThe sole premise of 'Wander' is right there in the name: You wander. You amble. You roam. you don't have to deal with pointless quests, mobs, and all that junk. It's just you and the vibrant, diverse terrain. You start out as an Oren, a tree creature, but can gain three more forms to change into:\n\n- The Hira is the first you will likely get: a female humanoid with fins on the back of the arms and legs which can act as a wingsuit while falling. The Hira moves and swims rather fast.\n\n- The griffin, which can fly. Flight mechanics feel right and realistic but require practice to get the handle of. You can spot thermals with LMB to see where you can get some extra lift or descend faster.\n\n- The- uh. . .lizard thing with the really long tail. Slow on land, but fast in the water.\n\n-----------------------\n\nNow, if you enter the game and find it feeling lifeless, that's because there are no NPCs. Only players. But there are not many players so you will often find yourself wandering alone and lost. . .but don't worry, ol' Bubbles here is gonna help you out. People can usually be found on that big ol' floating island, along the beaches, or near the strikingly obvious landmarks. Hira players can climb onto the backs of griffins to get a lift around, and can also jump off their avian friends to skydive, performing tricks and perhaps either landing in the water or on the back of the same or another griffin.\n\n-----------------------\n\nYou cannot communicate with a microphone or with text chat. Instead, you can communicate universally through drawn glyphs that allow your character to speak certain phrase of the custom language made for the game. The controls for this are difficult. You are required to draw on the screen (using your mouse, silly!)  the symbol you wish for your character to say. . .of course, there's then the problem on if you can remember the words themselves, requiring you to practice drawing and listening to the words so you can  understand other people.\n\n-----------------------\n\nThe game undeniably needs tweaking and fixing, but the core aspects of the game are wonderful for those people who like to take in exotic, fantastical scenery in a game world that does not spoonfeed the player the world's story. . .so go out there and explore- or, dare I say it- Wander!","June 9, 2015","true","6.5"," 18 of 40 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","18","40","0","0"

The atmosphere of the game is amazing and draws you in.\n\nThe Dev team work tirelessly to get updates out for the game, fixing problems that arise, adding in new features and taking community feedback on board.\n\nThe problem with the game though, is that it is a niche game. It wont appeal to everyone.\n\nThe gameplay is exactly like the name of the game, you Wander around the game and explore. You learn about the lore of the world by finding Lorestones. You learn the language by finding and discovering Rhozda stones. You can transform to 1 of 4 different characters by finding Transform stones which then let you change at will by using the LoreCave. With more versions of them being added, currently there are 2 different types of Griffin.\n\nThis game is perfect for relaxing and enjoying the atmosphere. Would be 90000 times better if/when VR Support and 1st person view is added in. But for now, we need to make do with what is there.\n\nHighly enjoy the game and i highly recommend it to anyone that this game appeals to. If you think it would be boring, dont get it, as its not the kind of game you would most likely like.","June 5, 2015","true","18.6"," 17 of 49 people (35%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","35","17","49","5","3"

If you are into goals, tasks, collecting trophies - go somewhere else.\n\nIf you enjoy walking along beautiful pathways, discovering waterfalls, ruins, learning about a culture that you may now be a part of, swimming below the oceans, flying over peaks, exploring caves and more, this game will suit you fine.\n\nIt's the most lush and pretty game I've ever played and I've really enjoyed discovering some of the little things, like the frogs in one of the ponds or seeing a bird fly overhead.   There are a lot of varied sounds of birds and insects along with scurrying things in the underbrush or bats in the caves.\n\nAs one of the testers, I've seen the game evolve as the small team building it tried out different ideas and then spent a big amount of time having to change to another platform.   It was worth the wait.\n\nAre there problems with it - yes, of course.  It's only been live to the public for four days.   What the heck do some of these people expect?   But the team (of about 10 now) have been working day and night trying to fix and upgrade the issues that have up and the fact that people play the game for .01 and then give it a thumbs down in the reviews is ridiculous.\n\nIf you are interested in this game, give the team a chance to work out the bugs and add new features to help players enjoy the game more (the new dictionary was installed today).\n\nIf you truly want an relaxing game that is interesting and intriging, give Wander a try.

If you want a completely polished AAA experience with no bugs or problems of any kind, this is not your game. The game is effectively in beta, and features exploring, enjoying the very rich and beautiful world, with a little culture shock along the way.\n\nThere are Lore Stones and Conversation Stones to listen to, and there is a dictionary for the in-game language. There's currently four shapes all players can transform into, but you have to find the other three stones that enable those additional shapes. The entire environment is hand-built, and no two places are identical.\n\nThis game (as of this writing) has been out only four days. Note the amount of time people have been playing before giving their reviews. It's hilarious, the way people have been jumping into this game and expecting a Quest-driven NPC dense game filled with a lundry list of things to do and places to visit. This just shows how much like Skinner Boxes recent games have become with everyone complaining about not being able to find the lever that would give them their treat.\n\nIf you want a truly relaxing game with an interesting history and gorgeous graphics, this is your game. If not, you might want to keep your distance until you get tired of pulling levers in other people's cookie cutter games.","June 6, 2015","true","229.3"," 19 of 56 people (34%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","34","19","56","3","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/estrogen/recommended/293280/","estrogen","Estrogen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/estrogen/","304 products in account","This game is pretty fun. As it's a noncombative mmo, I think half the fun is figuring out the language in the game along with the controls instead of them being readily delivered to the player. The game places strong emphasis on finding things. There are stones littered around the map with words that the player can learn in order to interact with other people. Players can also select one of four forms to further their explorations. Interestingly, players must find these forms first :)\n\nPros:\n\n. Interesting concept\n. Information about the world unfolds as you explore\n. Unique way of gaining forms by finding them\n. plenty of amazing places to hang out and meet people\n. plenty of places to explore\n. Unique language development\n. Gorgeous music and landscape\n. Nonviolent\n. No levels\n. No currency\n. No item level\n\n\nCons:\n\n. No ability to "talk" to other plays unless you learn the language (which is also a pro, as it  makes the game unique)\n. No ability to make permanent friends (no friendslist)\n. No ability to differentiate players from one another (everyone has same models/no playernames)\n. Graphics are a bit buggy at times\n. Controls are a bit difficult to figure out at first (but rewarding once you do)\n\n\nConclusion:\n\nThe game is pretty fun as the player "Wanders" around learning the language, forms, and landmarks that make the environment so unique. There are a few bugs, but it's opening day so that is to be expected. If you're looking for a noncombative game where the object is simply to explore and learn about the area around you, then this is the game for you.\n\n","June 4, 2015","true","12.8"," 36 of 96 people (38%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","38","36","96","11","0"

I love this type of game and enjoyed wandering around, even though the tree is difficult to see through sometimes.  I have a pretty decent PC with the settings way up high for graphics and resolution. I think there are a few glitches but none of them affect my enjoyment of the game.  I want to relax and wander and that's what I'm getting.  I get to figure things out, but there is no time limit and I'm not gonna die if I don't get to a certain 'level' in time.  Srsly, my dream game.\n\nSo far, this game is delivering most of what it promised.  I'm sure the developers will update to address the small glitches, but anyone who is looking for a fast pace will not like this game.  There are games out there that are also exploration games but have defined goals.  I like those too, but this is not like that, as far as I can tell.\n\nPro:\nno violence\ngraphics beautiful\nrelaxing sounds\nnarrator is pleasant sounding\nbeautiful scenery to wander\nsounds are important to knowing where you are\nhuge area to explore\n\nCon:\ni don't know yet\n\nI know some people will think the Pro list is boring, but to me, it is just what I'm looking for.  There are plenty of games out there to get your blood pumping and precious few that do the opposite.

After finally transforming into a woman, I was as happy as Bruce Jenner.  0/10.\n\nTo be a bit more helpful:\nThe world is pretty, though the graphics aren't the best I've seen.  The game play is slow and unintuitive.  You can see other players in the world, but the only way to communicate with them is through the in game language that you learn word by word by discovering stones.  Moving around the world is extremely slow, which I found extremely frustrating.  Even the help tips are extremely slow.  "Right Click" pause a second or two.  "Left click to draw" pause a second or two. "Draw this pattern" pause a second or two, then show the pattern slowly one stroke at a time with delays between each.  "Right click" pause a second or two.  Even following those instructions, you can get the pattern wrong and there isn't any indication until nothing happens.  When something happens, the character just speaks the word.\n\nAfter playing just over 2 hours, I didn't feel that I had accomplished much.\n\nGameplay aside, the game does not seem like it has gone through any testing / QA.  The resolution needs to be set each time you launch the game, and exiting the game crashes cryengine, which seems like they didn't bother to correctly close when you clicked the exit button.  I've had to use the 'can't move' option several times because my character got stuck after falling through terrain.\n\nI honestly wanted to like this game.  A relaxing non-combat MMO seemed like a nice change, but I feel like I've wasted my money on this game, and feel like playing it is wasting my time.  Hopefully, it'll get patched.  If the bugs were fixed, and game play sped up a little, I think it could have potential, but right now, it won't get played by me.","June 4, 2015","false","2.2"," 55 of 142 people (39%) found this review helpful 79 people found this review funny","39","55","142","79","6"

I've read the reviews but i've been waiting for this title for a while so decided to give it a go myself first before passing judgment. All I can say is, the developers must have been super fast in cleaning up the bugs people have been talking about because apart from some pollishing up the game killer bugs people are talking about don't seem to be there anymore.\n\nThe game environment is beautiful, though there are bugs they are obviously things that are going to be improved in the near future. The exploratory gameplay mechanic is something i've been waiting for, this is basically an MMO adventure game were we come together to solve the puzzle of what is going on in this universe. This is a game for people who want to solve a mystery, for people who like turning the page of a story one puzzle solve at a time (puzzle being finding the hints). I get the sense there is actually a big story waiting to be unravelled.\n\nThe one game mechanic i don't like is a lack of voice chat between players, communicating with the in game gestures seems like a cool idea but doesn't really work on a practical level. I'm hoping that is something they sort out, otherwise it will end up probably being a big persistant single player game with people running past each other :P.\n\nI am running the game on high quality and I have a first gen I7, 6 gig of ram, and a radeon r9 - 270x\n\nCan't wait to see how the story turns out and hopefully some more bug fixing :P","June 5, 2015","true","2.5"," 20 of 68 people (29%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","29","20","68","7","0"
