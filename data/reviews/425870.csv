Gyrodisc Super League is not an online multiplayer game (and according to the developer’s FAQ there’s no plan to turn it into one “at this time”). If you’re looking for a version of Windjammers you can play online, I recommend looking elsewhere.\n\nIf you’re willing to look past that omission though, you might see Gyrodisc for what it really is: a surprisingly addictive couch competitive local multiplayer game. Having spent several hours playing this game with a group of friends, it generates the same sort of good natured hollering and banter that you’ll get from a session of Samurai Gun or Gang Beasts, particularly in those chaotic four player doubles matches.\n\nThe game sticks pretty close to the Windjammers formula, with a very similar arrangement of abilities, although there are a few tweaks that set it apart. The throw, lob and spike and dive mechanics seem pretty familiar, although they’ve been moved onto separate face buttons on the game pad. Supers are now performed by holding down the throw or lob buttons respectively, so they can be initiated at any time rather than being automatically triggered by the game. You also have a little leeway to move around in this state (albeit slowly) which comes in useful for those cases where the disc looks like it’s going to just squeak past your charge. For all you purists out there there’s even an “Arcade Style” control mode in the options that puts the dive, throw and spike back onto a single button, Windjammers style (although personally I found that led to a lot of accidental diving).\n\nMy favourite addition though is a small one. Between rounds, and at the end of a match the players enter a sort of celebration state, where holding down the face buttons triggers different upper body poses like muscle flexes, waving your arms in the air or shaking your fist at a victorious opponent. It’s a small thing, but coupled with the fact that you can still move around in this state it leads to a surprising amount of hilarity, as you and your friends invent new and interesting ways to look like idiots on court.\n\nOf course, this is an early access game, and there are plenty of issues to be addressed. There’s very little single player experience to speak of right now (just AI bots in the versus mode) although according to the developers there’s an Arcade mode in the works. The AI definitely has some odd moments (on a number of occasions I’ve watched my AI doubles partner dive out of the way of a disc that was coming straight for it) but ramp it up to the highest difficulty level and there’s real challenge to be found there. After about ten singles matches against the maximum AI difficulty I’ve yet to win more than a point or two.\n\nThere are only two characters to choose from at the moment (the final game will apparently feature six) and you’re going to be looking at that same stadium in every game for the time being, though the selection of different courts to choose from certainly helps with this. There are currently five, and most will seem very familiar in their layout to Windjammers players, although the hockey variant definitely breaks the mould, and was one of my highlights of the night.\n\nUltimately If you’re dead set on online play (as many posters on the forums at the moment seem to be) I’d recommend looking elsewhere. On the other hand, if you’re after a fun local multiplayer title to play when your mates are round of an evening, I’d highly recommend giving this game a shot.","March 5","true","4.3"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/recommended/425870/","Steamified","Warwick J.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/","3916 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nGyrodisc Super League is Valiant Interactive’s early access and Steam debut. It’s an exciting and vibrant arcade sports game in which players throw a disc from one side of the field to the other and attempt to make the opposition miss the disc to score. Games are played similarly to tennis with singles and doubles matches. The game has the potential to be one of the best couch multiplayer sports games on Steam with the fast, frantic action becoming very addictive and laugh a minute.\n\nI did not particularly enjoy the experience of the single player game. The reason for this is simple. It’s far too shallow at this stage of development. You can play individual matches against an AI opponent and that is it. However, to the developers credit they are aware of this and are incorporating an ‘Arcade mode’ that will include multiple unlockable costumes for each character as well as a selection of mini-game modes that have been inspired by classic arcade games like breakout and space invaders. This sounds good in theory but I’d love for them to include a season mode. I find that these games are so much more exciting when you’re constantly battling to win matches in order to finish on top of the ladder and/or to reach the playoffs so that you can win a tournament. Examples of recent games that feature great arcade season or tournament modes include Rocket League (to be featured later on the Steamified Countdown) and Kopanito All-Stars Soccer which we featured back on January 7. It’s a very basic concept but it adds a lot of replayability to your game.\n\nWhat is present in the game already is definitely enough for the local multiplayer component of the game. I spent a short time playing this mode and for what it was it was certainly enjoyable. I expect that with future updates there will be even more to enjoy on this mode. It’s definitely going to be the biggest selling point for the game and while its still leaning towards more of a concept than a fully fleshed out entity it is already a lot of fun.\n\nA bit of a disappointment is the fact that the developers have no intention of incorporating an online multiplayer game. This will definitely have an impact on the size of the potential player base that the game will have. However, the action is so fast that any latency issues would make playing the game a nigh on impossibility – at least to an entertaining and enjoyable level so I can certainly understand why online multiplayer may be an impossibility for this title.\n\nAt this present stage of development if you have friends to play with then purchase a copy of the game because you will already get your monies worth. If not then I’d wait for arcade mode updates and see if what people are writing about it at that time is something that you would enjoy playing.\n\nFor our popular daily giveaways and similar reviews head over to http://www.steamified.com/\n\nTo begin your journey through our myriad of social media join our Steam Group","March 16","true","1.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bd0/recommended/425870/","bd0","BlackDraft","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bd0/","1506 products in account","Product received for free\n\nEarly Access Review\n\nIn Short:\nGyrodisc Super League is a neat title to include in your collection of "party games" with an enjoyable local multiplayer/co-op mode, however there is no online multiplayer mode at all. Only purchase it at a discount or if you frequently have someone around to play with.\nRecommended with reservations.\n\n\nAt Length:\nMy first match against an AI opponent ended rather fast as I was checking out the controls. The rematch, then, was already a close call! The AI didn't play particularly poorly or anything, no, the game's just that easy to get into. Even after a few more rounds, it was still challenging without ever feeling unfair.\nLikewise, computer-controlled players also make for valuable teammates in a doubles match and generally know when to act and when not. On the highest difficulty level, they're true professionals!\nHaving the learned the ropes, I found the controls to be precise and responsive. I was initially put off a bit by the lack of a crosshair or similar visualization of where you're aiming, but you get used to it. In retrospect, it makes sense, too; you don't want to show your local opponent the direction of your next throw.\n\nNow this is where it's at. Currently, there's just a normal versus mode with a couple of simple settings, for instance a time limit or little changes to the playing field. Although some singeplayer extensions are scheduled, I don't see myself returning to these for prolonged periods of time.\nDueling your friends right next to you, on the other hand, is immense fun and there's always room for a few short rounds of that. Gyrodisc Super League is very accessible and anybody can pick it up in an instant. Highly important for a game like this.\nAt the same time, you have two different characters with unique techniques (four more coming later) and the game does reward skill, so it's not exclusively casual in nature.\nThe biggest point of criticism directly relates to this: Despite a lot of new features to be released and multiplayer being the strength of the game, the developers have no intention to support online functionality. A missed opportunity, really. (If you want to play via internet, keep an eye out for Disc Jam.)\n\nAs for the presentation, the comic-style graphics aren't exactly awesome, yet look decent enough and suit the game well. You'll see and hear a cheering crowd and some arcade-y tunes in the background, which, again, fits nicely.\nIn the main menu, you have access to some basic audio and video options. Nothing sophisticated, but gets the job done.\nYou can also fully customize the controls for up to four players. Unfortunately, it is not possible to have multiple persons use a single keyboard for playing; you will need extra controllers.\n\nDo note that the game is still in Early Access and, as such, unfinished.\nFor one, there might be technical issues. Personally, I didn't encounter any and it runs perfectly fine for me.\nAdditionally, it may be subject to both next to no as well as substantial changes. This encompasses the planned updates mentioned above, for better or worse. The developers seem to be active in the game's Community Hub, though, so it's not unreasonable to assume they're going to follow their roadmap.\n\nMy closing thoughts are pretty much what I've written in the first section:\nGyrodisc Super League offers quick and easy fun for everyone and is worth trying out, but I'd suggest you to consider the local-only limitations of the multiplayer/co-op mode before buying. In terms of singleplayer content, other games will give you more for your money - split the price between four people playing together and it's a great deal.\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: Steamified provided me a free copy of the game for the purpose of this review.

However, as long as you're willing to judge Gyrodisc Super League on its own merrits, I don't see how you find an enjoyable and rewarading experience. For any who may be unfamiliar with either title, try to imagine frisbee/soccer/volley ball mashed up into a great multiplayer game.

The game is very easy to pick up and seems simple at first, but once you start pulling off some of the more complicated shots you start to feel like there's a lot of potential for skillful plays.\n\nYou can play with up to 4 people locally, plus there are options to play versus AI with customisable difficulty. The AI on the highest setting is absolutely BRUTAL.\n\nThere are a few different arenas to choose from too. The standard arena feels the most balanced but the Hockey arena is probably my favourite, with the opportunity to laugh at the expense of your opponents as they fluff a shot around the back of your goal and watch it ricochet straight into their own.\n\nIn general I had no stability issues as well which is always nice for an Early Access game!\n\nIf you're into local multiplayer or played Windjammers back in the day then I'd definitely recommend giving this a try.","March 5","true","1.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The core mechanic builds upon the likes of pong, tennis and air-hockey, but this game is so much more. While anyone can instantly understand the game at a glance, once you sit down for a match against another person the scope of the game begins to dawn on you. The gameplay is fast paced and packed with subtle mind games. Play a lame game and keep control of the centre of the court. Or try an aggressive gambit where you force your opponent to the net and challenge their reactions. If you get the read you can charge up a super move to make them pay for their predictability. It really is a great addition to any party game library, and I know I'll be loading it up to play with friends time and time again.","March 5","true","2.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The base gameplay already feels refined. The rules and the controls are simple and quick to pick up, yet the more I play the more I uncover the potential for skilled play and complex tactics.\n\nIt'd be great to have more character specials and arenas to play with but its easy to see how these can be added given there is a solid foundation in place.\n\nI'm a big fan of couch multiplayer games and it feels like Gyrodisk will be at its best played in this way. I've been enjoying playing vs the AI so far but I'll definitely get this running on the TV next time I have friends over.","March 6","true","4.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"
