You can click on some staff buildings and see the employee's skills, speed, attention and charisma and how much their wage are, you can hire more employees and fire them. You can upgrade certain buildings so that they more attract the people you wish them to (e.g. you can add a bell boy to the hotel so that the VIPs are happier to stay there) . You can click on each individual visitors and see their line of thought, this will let you know of things like if your restrooms are too hard to find, if the place is dirty, if your guests would like to do some drinking while they are gambling etc. Clicking on the visitors also allows you to see what they prefer (gambling, activity, rest er whatever) and what demographic they belong to (family, tourist, high roller or else) and you can build your lot to target certain people specifically because you can't please every one (people who are looking to relax will not like a lot that has many loud buildings such as casinos and circus' that appeal to people looking for activities).\n\nThe game has the option of sandbox or campaign. You set the difficulty in the sandbox to be as you are comfortable with and it is useful for practicing in preparation for the campaign which gets pretty challenging. The campaign includes the tutorial which is a bit annoying to go through. Also, the game doesn't save automatically and you can't save before finishing each campaign chapter it seems, bit annoying. The second campaign is not a tutorial at all and has events that require actions that were not covered in the tutorial, a bit of digging and trying things out is required to win. The third campaign chapter is more challenging even and I haven't been able to win it but as I'm learning it's getting closer and closer to beating my competitor neighbour.\n\nA few things I dislike about the game: there is no undo button, when you accidentally place a staircase a square away from connected to the upper-level floor, for example, your only options to correct the mistake is to sell the staircase for regain of a percentage of what it cost to place or to leave the staircase there. This makes it so you have to be very careful where you put down things and it's kind of hard to gauge where they'll go because there is no truly visible grid inside the casino.\n\nAlso this game seems to require a lot of management: Buildings will get in very poor state of repairs if you don't tell the mechanics to go visit them, slot machines will get nonfunctional because the cashier hasn't gone to empty them and this is on top of you having to monitor each building's reputation, income generation (which you can control by choosing within a range of fees charged and, on casino games, house advantage among other things).\n\nOverall, I like the game. Quite a lot actually. It's definitely not a game everyone would like though but if you like city-builders and management-heavy games that have only okay graphics I would recommend this game.\n\nI got it on sale and I have no regrets whatsoever   7.5/10","December 13, 2014","true","14.6"," 24 of 25 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","24","25","0","0"

I personally like little crappy tycoon games like this (Lemonade Tycoon, Fish Tycoon, ect...) It's not a hard game, just has a lot of micro-managment that isn't explained well, and the interface isn't great. I kind of enjoyed it once I figured things out. Graphics aren't a big deal for me, but if they are for you, then definately stay away. I reccomend you at least get through the tutorial and a few das past before you give up on it.\n\nBottom line: Good, so long as you don't mind figuring things out on your own and some bad graphics.

How a tiny video game company managed to trademark this before any fast food giant is beyond me but well done to them. If you've ever been to Vegas you'll see how everything just looks bloody awful. This video game manages to make everything look awful too. The core gameplay is Sims-like management of casinos, so you place furniture and stuff in order to make money. The customers inexplicably vomit/throw red cups everywhere and your staff just refuse to clean it up unless you drag them to the vomit. That's my lasting memory of this game. I literally can't remember anything else about Vegas: Make It Big which really does echo that famous saying: "What Happens in Vegas Is A Forgettable Experience and You Should Only Bother If You Can Get It for Less Than A Quid".","May 24, 2014","true","0.7"," 24 of 39 people (62%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","62","24","39","3","1"

If it was remade to be more complex, this game would be amazing. The idea has potential. The good points of the game would be the high customizability, being able to adjust all the settings, buy multiple lots that work alongside others, different themes and casino customization.\n\nI'd say, if you really wanted to purchase this game, get it on offer, preferably 50% pr greater.","May 7, 2014","false","4.3"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

I recommend this game! OK normally I could not be bothered to write a reveiw on a steam game but this game was so good it deserves one. Those who are looking for a high quality graphics game should not buy this game! However the graphics are decent enough and I picked this game up for £0.74 (about $1.10) and it was worth every penny. It is very in depth and is a proper tycoon game. Employ staff, buy lots and build casinos. Once you have done that you must build water and generator centres to make sure the lot is powered and water supply is maintained. You can also build hotels and shops.\n\nThe engine allows you to go into the casino itself and design everything from where you put the tables and slot machines to decoration and lighting!\n\nFor 74p I am very happy with this game and those looking for a tycoon game with a flexible difficulty from stupidly easy to very hard should buy this game!

The biggest upsides are the number of options and how much you can customize the interiors of casinos to your wishes.  You can make your casino as lush or barren as you want, make it a blackjack/craps paradise or only focus on slots.  With the largest casino, you can do both, but not every customer will like or appreciate all the gambling options.  Craps creates noise (ever been near one in Vegas?) while high rollers won't care for your low-limit slots.\n\nThe negative/positive benefit system is actually quite rewarding and nice.  The trick is that negatives can be offset by positives, once you learn that, you won't be bothered by people complaining about smell or noise, just add fountains or something else that creates positive calm or beauty.  Those positive objects though, come at a price, including maintenance, electricity and water if appropriate, but realy once you learn how to play the game, money isn't much of an issue anymore, which is something that could be improved.\n\nLearning not to build everything is another lesson that takes time.  Your property and casino can't be everything to everyone.  High rollers want luxury and high stakes games, while degenerate gamblers want drinks and your typical family want entertainment and lower stakes.  Unfortunately, the best way to make money is to cater to the high rollers, but then that might be realistic since I haven't seen a new casino in Vegas built for penny slot players either.\n\nThe flaws of the game are in the AI and will require micromanagement to solve.  Maintenance workers won't fix buildings or objects until they break, meaning that you will have to manually direct them to actually maintain buildings and objects before that happens.  The worst part though is with the janitors who will just stand around and have to be told to specifically go to an area in order to clean the trash.  This becomes tedious and no matter what, you'll have to live with some litter on your properties and inside that lush casino you built.\n\nIn all, this game is fun and addictive, but is too easy once you figure it all out.  Plus the AI issues make it annoying at times.  Still it's easily worth $5, you'll get many hours of fun playing and building your dream casino.","April 13, 2015","true","79.0"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","2"

I got this game on sale (£0.29 no less!!) and was amazed at the value for the game.\n\nNow if you played games like Hotel Tycoon 2 I would say this game is rather similar, it gives you freedom to buy plots of land to build everything in (giving you option to spend less but have less room to build untill you buy another plot) and most of the buildings are simple 'plop and leave' giving you more time to spend on the only buildings that truely need managing and the main point of the game, casinos!\n\nCasino building is where things get complicated, as you get to layout the entire innards of the casino you have placed, from adding in different heights, slot machines and gaming tables to placing your mechanics, security and hosts, and that can be kind of bewildering on your first visit to a large one (like seriously, how DO you fill those things haha). My advice for that though would be to layout your casino with different levels first, as this is actually free to do, and not only helps with organising the casino (and you only need to fill 1 section at a time if your lacking money), it looks pretty awesome to boot.\n\nOther than that, the game is pretty simple once you familiarise yourself with everything, which is pretty much fully explained through the first 2 campain levels, which I would highly recommend doing, as you cant simply "own" without learning the game (in fact the same with most games) which could explain some of the 10 min played negative reviews.\n\nAs for the cons to this game, I would say theres not enough content in the game, it may seem dwarfing at first, but after a while I've found myself using the same few gaming tables and such, and the buildings outside, for me atleast, are more asthetic and just ways to get more people into my hotels and casinos.\n\nIn short, I would recommend this game as it has its quirks but is pretty fun once you learn the game. Would I recommend it at full price (£2.99) possibly. Would I recomend it on sale, yes. Would I recommend it at just 29 pence? You'd be crazy to miss that one lol.","December 2, 2015","true","15.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
