Then click "repair" and it should work.  If not there is the Steam Community that gave me this advice.\n\nNow, the actual review of the game.  The world's most famous fictional detective versus the most infamous serial killer by name have finally come to blows in a strange blend between fantasy and reality in this game, and for what it's worth, the story is very well-composed concerning the killer's trail.\nAs Sherlock and Watson, you must hunt down the murderous Whitechapel Killer following his deadly clues, reliving the famous incidents that granted Whitechapel a most deadly reputation for the next 130 years.  The voice acting could be better, though I do enjoy Watson's VA greatly as well as the odd incidental NPC wandering around.\n\nThe anatomical gathering of clues and deductions are very fun and remain more or less the same throughout the series with a great precision.  Some of the puzzles are actually really neat, however there are some that are quite frankly badly conceived due to not being great puzzles.\nAnd I'm not saying that because I'm stupid, I'm saying that because, there is a puzzle in the game that requires you to know about a specific war.  That is really terrible, and any puzzle that requires outside knowledge, is a bad puzzle.  That's the only example, but there are some other puzzles that are rather unclear as to what to do.\n\nThankfully, this series has gotten a lot better and I do recommend more people to play the much later instalments, especially The Testaments of Sherlock Holmes which is MUCH more well-played than this game frankly.  So TL;DR\n\nPros:\n- Excellent well-composed accuracy concerning the various details and theories of Jack the Ripper\n- Anatomical deductions are pretty fun to do\n\nCons:\n- The save bug which screwed me out of 6 hours of gameplay\n- One or two puzzles are either outright unfair in requiring knowledge of certain things, or demand INCREDIBLY specific tasks.\n\nHonestly, I want to give this game a Neutral rating as there's a lot to like but also a lot to dislike.  If you REALLY like Sherlock Holmes, try to get it and see what happens.  But for the love of God, save often.","October 30, 2014","true","10.1"," 31 of 31 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","31","31","0","0"

Moreover, the gameplay itself also has a couple of aces up its sleeve to get one's attention during the playthrough.\nGear up and bring two legends together while leading your own investigation of the case that terrified London in 1888.

It freezes after the 'New Game' button is clicked and fails after you minimize it. Useless!\n\nUpdate! I did find the solution:\nOriginally posted by swenor: Open Find and search for 'PhysXLoader64.dll' , it should be in your C:\...\Nvidia etc. folder. Copy the file and paste it in your game folder, where the .exe is. If you have a 64-bit version of windows, try pasting it in the C:\Program Files folder, since that is the 64-bit folder and the Nvidia folder is in C:\Program Files (x86).

Sounds awesome, right? Well, I think so since I'm a geek. For the most part, this was an enjoyable adventure game even with its flaws.\n\n+ Seriously, I've always thought this crossover would've been a great idea, glad to see it actually happened.\n+ The deduction boards were probably the best puzzles, at least in my opinion; they were fun and required some thinking.\n+ 1st person view addition, I already prefer this over 3rd person view for adventure games.\n+ Good story, provides some suspense and thrills through out.\n+ Not too challenging, and not exactly easy either. Progressive difficulty is done right for the most part.\n+ Analyzing victims is lots of fun lol.\n+ Dat ending.\n\n- Errands, bleh. I'm fine with that in GTA, Skyrim, etc. But here, not exactly the most fun time.\n- Graphics are crap for a 2009 game.\n- Every now and then, you'll find grammatical errors in the subtitles. It annoys me.\n- Voice acting isn't exactly the greatest.\n- Some puzzles are dumb; for example, why does Sherlock need a "pivot" and a stick to move a barrel? Is he weak? lol.\n- Some puzzles are annoying when it comes to registering your solution, such as the one where you narrow down Jack's "comfort zone" and the final deduction.\n\nIf you're a fan of Sherlock, or interested in Jack the Ripper case, I recommend this. Heck, if you love mysteries, or enjoy solid adventure games, then get this game.","July 30, 2015","true","14.0"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

They unite two good things at least: games and old books.  I love their work SO much.\nSherlock versus Jack, the Ripper is fanciful, but the game is good. Some details are not so good as in "Crimes and Punishments" because I believe C&P was made after S. vs J., but still is interesting and nice.\nSometimes, if you are not aware of the previous dialogues or even if you are aware, you kinda don't know where to go or who to look for. It kinda misses a "goal" board, "what to do next" at certain parts, specially at Whitechapel area. You kinda have to interact with a lot of people or try to enter in a lot of places until you find your goal exactly. But it's just a minor thing.\nWhen you gather enough information to discover Jack's identity, it becomes even more fun.","September 19, 2015","true","15.0"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

For this reason, I'll supply my specs, though I cannot certify that this will make the game run for you:\nWin 7 64 bit\nRadeon HD 7770\nAMD quad core 2.94 ghz\n\nOn with the game,\n\nIt's an adventure game with a few twists.\nFirst off, you can operate the game from two different perspectives: Third-person for the old school point and click feel, and first person, which I prefer.\nBesides the collecting items, you will have the opportunity to examine crime scenes and fill out some diagrams that include the clues you've gathered. The game won't let you fail these. Though at first thought that might seem lazy, the game is pretty much packed with detail and it's hard to see the devs making branching paths given the amount of attention and longevity of the game. Along the same lines the game also won't let you leave certain areas without collecting all the items.\nThere are many texts to read in this game and I would say that it is important to read them, as most do divulge important information that is pertinent to your case.\n\nThe voice acting, aside from one character who is thankfully absent for most of the game, is top notch. You can tell that, even though there was a budget as far as recording goes, the devs spared no expense for finding actors who wanted to portrey their roles well.\nThe music is fitting and includes some great pieces from the Romantic era including one of my personal favs, Schubert's Trio in Eb.\n\nWhile the puzzles can be hit or miss, they mostly hit. They make sense and you should feel like you understand what the game wants from you, though there is one puzzle that involves a map that is somewhat obtuse given to a problem with widescreen resolutions, but it is do-able without much fussing about.\n\nThough the graphics aren't the best by today's standards they do the job. The environments are well done and I felt very immersed in the places the game put me in. Hookers, drunks and theives around every corner.\n\nAll of these things came together for a perfect storm of presentation. Nothing felt out of place and I was enthralled with this title from beginning to end.\n\nIf you're looking for an adventure title that'll suck you in you should definitely give this title a go, though you should do your research to figure out if it'll run for you.","February 1, 2015","true","12.1"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

I originally played it on Xbox 360 as a rental when it released, the Title caught my interest. Turned out to be a game I loved so much I bought it again on Steam. The PC version is far superior with the exception of the following, but don't let it sway you away, it can be corrected. It's not a broken game any means, just needs help on newer hardware when you first install. Some users (like myself) have an issue with the game mot loading initially: for most people this can be easily corrected by opening the game's folder ("C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\Sherlock Holmes versus Jack the Ripper\Support\PhysX") and re-installing the two PhysX installers, and selecting the repair option if asked to by the installer for each one.\n\nNow.. about the game. This game has good performance and plays well on a rig that pumps 30 or 60+ FPS. The game looks great too. It may not blow you away graphically, but you can see the developers cared about quality. Little things - like tiny signs pasted to a brick wall are clear and easy to read, the smoke in pubs is realistic, the lighting and shadows are nice and mood-setting: little things like this you will notice as you play. I like this game's style.\n\nThe game does have a few places where you can tell they were developing on a budget. Some of the NPC characters walking the streets are recycled, and so are their voices. To top that, the NPC townsfolk have some pretty lame voice overs. However, don't let this stray you! If you play the game like a proper Sherlock Holmes would, you'll soon find out these people are of no use to you, and just ignore them and focus on the case. The good news here, is that the NPC characters you have actual dialogue with in the game, all have pretty good voice acting. I actually like this balance, it made me laugh at the cheesy peasants in the streets as I strolled along to talk to my fancy doctor, merchant, and police colleagues and such. This gave me a real feel for the classic Sherlock Holmes arrogance, lol. Also, you get to have a laugh at prudent Wason in a brothel in the middle of the night, if you are into the books and know his character.\n\nThe story isn't half bad either. I really liked the ending. Sure, if you want to be a real nit-picker or snob you could point out all it's imperfections... but you'd just be robbing yourself of a fun game that really did try to stay true to the source material and history, while providing a unique twist to preserve continuity.\n\nPlay this game.","November 4, 2014","true","14.8"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

Even though this game is the fifth installment this game seems to precede The Awakened & Nemesis in terms of chronological narrative. This is seen in this installment we are introduced to Barnes the book store owner as if for the first time while he was a known character in the last two. Otherwise this game could be played by itself since this deals with the actual events of the Jack the Ripper case instead of many fictional characters in the series. This game was very well presented that checking up on some of the minor details I am surprised how well Frogware presented a plausible answer to the Jack the Ripper mystery.\n\nThe game isn't completely full of perfect creations. Some of the puzzles are so insanely hard with no real indication of feed back or clear instruction is just guess work. In addition to this, alot of the quests felt like one giant errand run tangent from one person for the next to get some basic clues. The ending ties the fictional resaults of Sherlock Holmes and the real life outcome of the case which was indeed very intresting. If a bit disapointing. Overall this game is good but not great. It definately calls back to the horrific acts done in The Awakened. The ending is more than enough to play though the game to see how it all ties together.","October 10, 2014","true","6.9"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

The puzzles are of adequate difficulty and the items required are most of the time easy to find. I really like the choice between 1st person with keyboard (WASD) movement and 3rd person mouse-driven movement, although I played the entirety of the game in 1st mode. This game in general pays great respect to the source material and succesfully incorporates the story of "Jack the Ripper",  employing a variety of elements from the real life events. Furthermore,  with the satisfying duration for this game it feels as if you get your money's worth. The deduction board and timelines really feel like actual detective work without access to modern advances and feel very much in-place with a Holmes game. The Holmes-Watson dynamic is also well utilized in this game to make for this elements of Holmes's stories that attracts such fandom.\n\nThe game has some minor problems, but nothing that spoils your fun. Some of the NPC voice acting is not good, but this is rare and it is limited to random "area populating" NPCs. Some puzzles would really be easier with an explanation, because you are hindered from advancing not due to actual puzzle difficulty but due to not understanding the rules or limitations in interacting with the computer game. There is also a puzzle that requires some encyclopaedic knowledge that cannot be found in-game (US civil war battles).\n\nPersonally, without spoiling it for you, I found the ending a smart way to compromise between a videogame structure and the actual unfolding of the events. If you engage in "ripperology" as a hobby, you might strongly disagree with it, but hey, it is just a game.\n\nOverall, if you are a Holmes or Jack the Ripper stories fan, I would recommend this game. Personally, I waited until this game was bundled, but if you are a fan of other Frogware games, this is a solid purchase.","July 13, 2014","true","22.0"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

But I think it introduces the player to the NPCs. And running errands build up trust between them, hence the inclination to provide information that they otherwise would not tell the police.\n\nIn particular, the story is congruous with the alleged crimes by Jack the Ripper in Whitechapel.

At a certain point even Sherlock Holmes remains speechless when confronting the last victim corpse. Nothing excessively gruesome is being shown but it's all about Jack the Ripper, a formidable figure of whom nobody knows or saw anything for sure and you must investigate deeply to find the way to the truth behind his identity and nature.\nJust like the previous chapter this is a point'n'click adventure, originally designed in 1st person View, but now presented with the possibility to play in 3rd person view and obviously with a remastered Graphic. The interface is almost the same as in previous titles but there's few very important innovations in this chapter's gameplay which have quickly become the key moments that best represent a game dedicated to Holmes and Watson adventures: The deduction schemes, reconstructions and experiments. The best inno are simple moments that require you to order your ideas and clues, link them and choose the right conclusions to better understand the next direction for your investigations. Reconstructions involve both Holmes and Watson trying to replicate the murder after a accurate analysis of the crime scene and the corpse. Experiments are exactly what the name says, simulation of situations or reactions to determine the murder weapon or other particular conditions or clues. These innovations are implemented in the classic gameplays elements so there are dialogues, riddles and puzzles, and errands... maybe a bit too many errands, compared to the previous chapters, but I liked the gameplay so much that I simply didn't mind too much.\nThey didn't waste too much effort in music as there are still the classic melodies from the previous chapters and one or two new tracks, but still they fit as they rarely pretend to stand in the gameplay unless the cutscene requires it to better represent the events.\nThe game takes place once again in London but this time we won't see any of the great marvelous buildings so typical of the city, but we'll be wandering back and forth in Whitechapel, the most squallid neighbourhood which is well represented as it's full of life with people and workers wandering on the roads, beggars, streetwalkers (seems like pro stitutes is a censored word... -.-), ill people and whatever. The Remastered engine shows nicely the alleys we'll be visiting (even though it has some heavy loads moments due to and excessive abuse of effects on water and reflections) but we won't be able to admire any particular example of level design except for some occasional office or internal ambients.\n\n+++PROs+++ GAMEPLAY. The gameplay always show great interesting riddles and puzzles, but now has been seriously improved with some new mechanics such as the deductions schemes, reconstructions and experiments, and these sections best reflect and represent a Sherlock Holmes adventure.\nSTORY. Well this chapter is about chasing a mysterious figure the likes of Jack the Ripper and while I can't say nothing about it because spoilers I can say that your investigations will show a side of London you haven't seen before: Poverty, prostitution, disease, haunted Jewish community  and so on.\nENGINE. The original engine has been remastered and improved and even though it hasn't improved any models it has improved textures and other details such as water reflections.---CONs--- WHAT'S NEXT? Yes, the whole game is guided, it tells you where to go next, who should we speak next and this is fine. The proble is in certain moments where you're trying to reconstruct scenes or examining clues and you need to perform a particular action but there's no explanation about it (and I'm not talking about riddles and puzzles but proper sections or mechanics which are not properly explained or requires a millimetric precision - see maps or Watson with the lantern)\nHEAVY ENGINE. Well, honestly I've been able to walk around without any issue but the water and reflection effects that are so much improved are almost never seen and still you can feel them as when you're near one of the couple of the barrels in the whole game the frame rate will drastically drop.

If this happens, check the forum for fix. Worked for me.\n\nVery good game for it's time and on level with the rest of the good part of this series.\nThe voice actors and music are the same as in previous games; decent to good, nothing terrible in voice acting but a few random volume/quality changed from sentence to sentence some times.\n\nThe story follows Sherlock Holmes as he investigates the brutal murders of some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s in Whatechapel, London. The game is slightly less gory and bloody than other games in the series, mostly because the murder victms you inspect are drawings and dolls, and not 3d-models, which gives a completely different feel; but then again you may not want to see models of women with their guts and organs ripped out and face cut open, so a pretty good design choice. Still not a game safe for children.\n\nThe game visits both new places and a few places known from other game in the series. The puzzles still give no clues about how they are to be solved, which can be frustrating. There is no failure state in this game, so no real reason to save often (thought there is no autosave, so do save if you plan to closing the game), and the game never crashed for me.\n\nThe game does not rely as heavily on document-reading as the previous ones and there's no quiz or direct minor questions asked to chekc if you're paying attention. You may have to read up to solve a few of the puzzles though.","May 15","true","13.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Where most games in the series are based in fiction, Sherlock Holmes vs Jack the Ripper is based on actual history, and it sticks to it surprisingly well. Almost every character in the game was an actual person involved in the case, and the game follows a possible interpretation of the events (which, interestingly, actually goes against Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's own theory which speculated that the Ripper could actually be female) pretty closely. The Whitechapel regions are also recreated fairly well, though they do reuse a lot of obvious models from the previous games in order to fill the larger street population.\n\nThis does cause the potential issue of it not being interesting enough, however; the game is historically accurate enough that it does a pretty effective job of killing the mythological status that Jack has gained through most works of fiction about him, which may or may not disappoint fans of his story - this game is very much a story of the man, rather than the legend. The real-life inspiration also leads to the game being a bit less gorey than previous games like Sherlock Holmes: Awakened, with most of the corpses in this being replaced by slightly tamer drawings to give respect to the real victims - the final victim isn't even shown on screen except in a clay replica back at Holmes's office, due to the extent of damage that the real-life Ripper did to her.\n\nOverall, while I can't say this game is my favorite in the series, it's still pretty great, and while its portrayal of the Ripper might not please everyone, I thought it was interesting to see the case from a historic perspective instead of being heavily fictionalized.","April 2","true","21.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

The story is gripping as the true events and thats propably what kept me playing this game to the end. The game works pretty well at some points and has a level that is interesting to solve on other times the puzzles seem insanely difficult to solve. i have in the past back in the days (on amiga & mid 90'ies pc) played alot of adventure point and click games like monkey island, dark seed, phantasmagoria and so on. but this one has some practically unsolvable puzzles that in my opinion should have been dumbed down a bit, well its not that they are unsolvable but several 20 numerical codes will take an unreasonable time to solve atleast. well i i wasnt interested in spending hour upon hours on some of those codes so i honestly used a walktrough for some parts of the game and even then these codes was a hazzle to say the least. Besides from some of the puzzles and the mechanics i had problems with the game on different fronts as the game sometimes froze it wouldnt save on regular basis and i played it on a pc from the time of its release so i had to keep saving the game as often i would remember as i forgot it a couple of times and had to replay 2-3 hours of gameplay a couple of times. As i said it has its ups and downs but unless you are really interested in sherlock holmes or jack the ripper or for that sake point and click adventures i would not rcommend this game at all and im sure there's way better point and click adventures at the market.

Too bad this game set the bar too high, and made the other Holmes games look less appealing. Especially the older games.\nHaving said that, the game is a fine game, and one which I hope Frogwares continues to build as a standard of quality.\n\nBasically, you solve various crimes committed by Jack the Ripper. Each case brings you closer to the killer, to which his methods are ever so questionable. Still, Holmes does need to do his job, and solve this case.\nLike from "Holmes: Awakened" and "Holmes: Nemesis", you still have Holmes Vision and teleportation.\nIn this game, you'll be doing a lot of travelling around the town where the deaths occur. And you'll be analysing the scenes to extract clues and what not to help gain much information about the killer.\n\nOne of the key aspects of the game is the "development tree" part, these are parts where, like the quizzes in "Holmes & the Silver Earring", you need to connect certain parts of the case together to create new information.\nUnlike "Holmes & the Silver Earring", you're told what you got wrong or right, and for the global "development tree" for the case as a whole, you can complete it as you go, or all at the end.\n\nCharacters are interesting in terms of their roles, ranging from ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, to Jewish locals to the town doctor, they all provide some aspect of information relevant to the case.\nYou even get to see Jack the Ripper's scenes prior to his killings, which are from his perspective, which adds more mystery to the case on hand.\n\nInterface is still consistent with "Holmes: Awakened" and "Holmes: Nemesis", though I don't recall if there was an in-game guide, like those games named. You can also switch between first and third person perspectives, which does help find certain clues in the overworld.\nAnd running is toggled on and off using Shift (or was it Spacebar?), meaning getting around places is slightly faster tha previous games.\n\nThematically, the game is a mixed bag. I mean, there's a part where you find out about Dr. Tumblety's collection, consisting of female private parts and he shows them off the other men, and another part when you fool the local gang into giving you information. Certainly, a bunch of different themes make this an engaging game, because when you're not analysing crime scenes, you're probably solving an actual puzzle or talking to a drunk reporter.\n\nOverall, this would be a solid 9/10. Sure, the ending is fictitious, but at least it made sense.\nBut I'd have to say, finding Jack the Ripper's house has to be the worst puzzle in this game. You know, the one where you have to circle his whereabouts on a map. Yeah, that one.","December 16, 2014","true","19.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I tried again taking an hour to replay through all the puzzles I had already solved. Knowing that the game was probably going to crash again I tried to save repeatedly but it turns out the save-function fails past a certain point. SHvJtR crashed again at the same point (at Liz Stride's murder scene). I gave up.\n\nSome other points:\n- inspired by actual history: yay?\n- The graphics are bad and look even worse with age.\n- unskippable dialogue\n- what are you supposed to do most of the time? No clear direction about what you can do.\n- Voice Acting is OK\n- puzzles are either OK or bad\n- Combine the Hammer and Tongs together in your inventory because. You have this and many other stupid inventory puzzles that make almost no sense.\n- many puzzles are find-the-missing-object-which-is-always-in-the-background-but-not-active-until-after-a-random-conversation-later\n\nSHvJtR is not all bad, it's just that Frogware's latest Sherlock games are much better.  Save yourself the disappointment and buy a recent Sherlock Holmes game instead.

I tried all the suggested fixes from the forum, including copying PhysX DLL files to the game's directory, but I was never able to solve this issue.\n\nThe gameplay itself is alright, but you will find yourself mostly doing petty fetch quests, and solving poorly-explained, awkwardly designed puzzles. There's also the issue that often crops up when games are developed by non-English speakers, as some of the writing is just odd, sounds off, or in some cases just plain don't make sense.\n\nLastly, you can switch between first and third person to navigate the world, which is good, since something about these Frogrwares games gives me immediate nausea in the first-person persepective.\n\nI wanted to like this game, I tried to like it, but in the end I had to admit I don't like it very much at all.","November 30, 2013","false","8.3"," 4 of 15 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","4","15","0","0"

I'd reccomend it to any history or sherlock holmes  fans, or even anime fans of Black Butler.  I had the same issue getting the program to start as others have noted in their reviews. If you follow the advice given by several other people in their reviews, then the game will work perfectly!\n\nI had quite a lot of trouble with many of the puzzles, and often needed help to get through them, though my least favorite was the map at the end to pinpoint the killer.\n\nThe plot, however, is quite enjoyable and very much worth the time and $10 to get it. I would love to collect the rest of the titles for Sherlock Holmes, and I feel each one makes me just a little smarter. The history of it was very well researched, especially the conditions and mutilations of the bodies and injuries they suffered from their murder. It took me about 15 hours to solve, including annoying puzzles.

I am a Sherlock Holmes fan, a Lovecraft fan and deeply interested in Ripper-lore as well, and if I didn't know better I'd think that Frogwares are going out of their way to please me.\n\nThe games are by no means perfect, and this one is no exception, but if you are as into the protagonist and subject matter as I am, you'll forgive the flaws.\n\nThe pros:\n-The voice acting for the characters of Holmes and Watson are very close to how I have always imagined them from the stories\n-The story is very well researched; the developers have obviously spent a lot of time collecting materials and connecting them with the story as it unfolds. This also means that, like the other Holmes games from Frogwares, there are lots of documents to read. That may be a plus or minus, based on your preference.\n-It feels like you are actually solving the crime in a good whodunnit\n-The conclusion is far from the worst take I have seen. And for the most part, I think the game treats the evidence astutely.\n-The puzzles related to the murders (decuctions, conclusions etc.) are fun, if rather easy.\n\nThe cons:\n-The game is very linear and holds your hand a lot of the time. When you need to check out a new location, Holmes will tell you precisely that, whether it was obvious or not. And you can't leave locations until your work there is done ("No, I haven't discovered everything yet"), nor can you go back to locations where your work is already done ("I have no reason to go that way"). It would make the game a lot more challenging - and immersive - if you were allowed to go wherever you pleased. That would make the game a lot harder, of course, and the first play-through would certainly take a lot longer.\n-The puzzles in this game are for the most part arbitrary and irrelevant to the case (fix a gas leak, fixing an electric winch by connecting wires , fishing out a necklace from between floorboards in a slide puzzle etc.), though challenging and entertaining enough\n-Some puzzles are just... odd ("Oy vey, I would lend you my mask, but unfortunately it is in that cobra cage for some reason, so you will have to figure out a way to get the snake out first"). Brings a bit of levity to the game, though.\n-Tedious errands ("I will tell you what I know if you do such and such for me")\n-The quality of the voice acting varies.\n\nStill, all in all, I thoroughly enjoyed this game, warts and all, and if your interests are at all similar to mine I can definitely recommend it.","October 26, 2015","true","16.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The controls for walking around are ridiculously clunky. Using items is a hassle as half the time you have to equip an item then click on something to use it, and the other half you can use the item automatically. Some times when you click an item or location, it doesn't even describe what the item is. The game is difficult, but often for the wrong reasons and it's frustrating. I've heard good things about the Sherlock series, and hopefully the other games aren't like this.","December 20, 2015","false","13.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I am a Sherlock Holmes fan, a Lovecraft fan and deeply interested in Ripper-lore as well, and if I didn't know better I'd think that Frogwares are going out of their way to please me.\n\nThe games are by no means perfect, and this one is no exception, but if you are as into the protagonist and subject matter as I am, you'll forgive the flaws.\n\nThe pros:\n-The voice acting for the characters of Holmes and Watson are very close to how I have always imagined them from the stories\n-The story is very well researched; the developers have obviously spent a lot of time collecting materials and connecting them with the story as it unfolds. This also means that, like the other Holmes games from Frogwares, there are lots of documents to read. That may be a plus or minus, based on your preference.\n-It feels like you are actually solving the crime in a good whodunnit\n-The conclusion is far from the worst take I have seen. And for the most part, I think the game treats the evidence astutely.\n-The puzzles related to the murders (decuctions, conclusions etc.) are fun, if rather easy.\n\nThe cons:\n-The game is very linear and holds your hand a lot of the time. When you need to check out a new location, Holmes will tell you precisely that, whether it was obvious or not. And you can't leave locations until your work there is done ("No, I haven't discovered everything yet"), nor can you go back to locations where your work is already done ("I have no reason to go that way"). It would make the game a lot more challenging - and immersive - if you were allowed to go wherever you pleased. That would make the game a lot harder, of course, and the first play-through would certainly take a lot longer.\n-The puzzles in this game are for the most part arbitrary and irrelevant to the case (fix a gas leak, fixing an electric winch by connecting wires , fishing out a necklace from between floorboards in a slide puzzle etc.), though challenging and entertaining enough\n-Some puzzles are just... odd ("Oy vey, I would lend you my mask, but unfortunately it is in that cobra cage for some reason, so you will have to figure out a way to get the snake out first"). Brings a bit of levity to the game, though.\n-Tedious errands ("I will tell you what I know if you do such and such for me")\n-The quality of the voice acting varies.\n\nStill, all in all, I thoroughly enjoyed this game, warts and all, and if your interests are at all similar to mine I can definitely recommend it.","October 26, 2015","true","16.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I just lost 2 hours of gameplay (I assumed autosave was a thing...) due to a major crash of the software. The mouse stutters and lags a lot at certain points. At this time, the mouse failed, I had to swipe the mouse over the pad three to four times to reach the requested marker in the game, and then it crashed.\n\nIt's a very nice story and I enjoy the enviroment a lot, but it's a ♥♥♥♥ing crash fest. Now I remember why I uninstalled the game in June 2014 (which was my last save, that I had to come back to, since the game crashed...).

Twice I just couldn't pick up the objects needed to complete a puzzle or an investigation (even if they were highlighted by pressing the space key) so -at the end of my rope- I have been forced to use downloaded saved games to override those points. These bugs seem to be related somehow to widescreen video resolutions so be aware of that before buying (or just grab saved games from the internet and enjoy the game).","December 19, 2015","true","18.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's as close to the ripper murders of 1888 as you will find. The puzzles were a tough challange, but the game was fun. The artwork was outstanding as well as the voice acting and music. I had one problem with my resolution, which through my own investigation was solved. When I got to the second murder scene, I could not click on all of the evidence hot buttons, and could find no answers from the internet discussions and no reply from Frogwares, the developer. If  no resolution is found, you can't proceed. If this happens to you, do the following:\nGo to your steam games folder under Common/sherlock holmes vs. jack the ripper/Game folder. Scroll down in the Game folder untill you see Render/fixed_aspect_ratio = false    Change the false to true, and save. You should now be able to enjoy the game after restarting.
