I had to check it out and see if it lived up to these claims and came away more than impressed.\n\nVibrant and neon minimalist structures sprawled out before you, seemingly endless. The expansive and cluttered glitchy landscapes of Black Ice call for some serious exploration with the promise of great discovery and rewards.\n\nThe more you hack, the deeper into the thick of the mainframe you get and the more colorful buildings of various size and level will be found.\n\nYou'll start off fighting smaller building you find in order not to overwhelm yourself with hordes of high leveled enemies and your puny starting weapons. As you fight, you'll level. As you level you'll find better loot, and damn does it feel good when you locate that one super rare rainbow rifle with insane DPS.\n\nThe amount of randomized loot is massive with stat modifications to each one creating a near infinite array. It seems to scale with your level making the progression feel great, keeping you constantly hunting for that next sweet piece of destruction.\n\nThe music from artist V-Axys is rad and it befits the cybernetic nature of the atmosphere perfectly. There's a really good variety of track already with some serious quality and you'll come across different pulse-pounding rhythms with each new structure you hack and battle your way into, keeping the encounters fresh and intense each time.\n\nThe addition of these new tracks is one that wasn't in the game last I played and just shows the dedication that will be going into making the game into the most engrossing experience possible, it's already looking fantastic.\n\nBlack Ice is just a hell of a lot of fun, especially with a friend. With the amount of procedurally generated cyber-land to scour and the increasingly awesome and empowering loot held within the hackable towers players just won't want to stop playing\n\nYou'll always spot something in the distance to check out, some new piece of equipment you'll want to keep leveling a bit more just to try out, and every time you feel like you're about to stop playing you'll get just one more reason to keep going. It's very hard to put down.\n\nDue to the quick, addictive pacing and progressive nature of the game it's the perfect title to pick up for quick hacking sessions as well as to get immersed in the deep leveling and loot system for hours with a friend.\n\nBlack Ice comes highly recommended to anyone who's a fan of Shooters, Co-op, craploads of meaningful loot, or retro and cyberpunk aesthetics in general.","July 9, 2014","true","21.3"," 79 of 91 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","79","91","0","4"

And it's made by such a handsome developer, too!\n\nEdit: All joking aside, here's a real review. It's biased because I made the game, but then, all reviews are subjective anyway\n\nI made Black Ice because I wanted to experience hacking as described in Neuromancer and Snow Crash. I also wanted to play Diablo 2 and Quake 3 at the same time. You'll be compelled to hack, excited to find your next piece of loot, but hesitant, filled with a moment of dread, because you know that if you make one mistake, you're dead.\n\nYou want customization? All the abilities are items you find. All the items are procedurally generated - billions of 'em. Want to fill your bar with 8 guns and a jetpack? Fine by me. Want to stock up on healing items and be an unkillable tank? Do it!\n\nYou can take your character from the demo to the full version single player to multiplayer. You can (and people have) spend hundreds of hours jacked in, finding the best loot, hacking ever bigger servers.  The enemies (and the loot) scale with difficulty level, which up quite a bit. The game is a complete experience right now, but I'm still adding stuff. I'm adding new enemies soon, but even now, enemies can come with powerups or in different combinations that ensure every hack is different.\n\nIt basically boils down to this - do you like blowing things up in first person, but you also love action RPGs that you can really chew on - with approachable but deep mechanics? And then you also love cyberpunk and bright colors? Buy my game. Or at least try the demo!  Where else are you going to find a game with a really responsive developer, no DRM, no microtransactions, great multiplayer, and tons of depth to explore?","July 8, 2014","true","99.4"," 178 of 249 people (71%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","71","178","249","15","31"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/geemersteamer/recommended/311800/","geemersteamer","dur&al","http://steamcommunity.com/id/geemersteamer/","6 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI'm something of a gameplay purist & this is one of the purest a gaming experiences I've ever had. It's probably the only truly 3D FPS game out here, where you're forced by the design to watch your six at all times. It makes for one heck of an experience; an excellent throwback to adrenaline-spiking 80s arcade games like Robotron. Only thing missing is a big neon score-counter at the top center that whizzes off digits as you rack up kills.\n\nWhen the hacking starts, you'd better move like you're on fire or you'll find yourself staring at the gameover menu faster than an AIMbot beam. My ADHD levels are pretty steep, which means I get bored quickly if I'm not constantly reminded of why I need to not be daydreaming. Black Ice is like chess on speed. The line between stimulus and response becomes so blurred so as to be nonexistent: how am I gonna get that rare item over there without breaking the hack? I could probably make it if I just slot a teleport mod and -- OH ♥♥♥♥ THERE'S A DOZEN SPIDERS RIGHT BEHIND ME (and while you're whipping around to take care of this turn of events WHAM, you're rammed right outta the ring by like, 3 taRAMtulas who spawned while you were debating your next move 3 seconds ago).\n\nThe only break you get is when you ain't hacking. Otherwise there isn't a single moment where you're not fighting for your life with angry, colorful threats coming from every direction. If you hack more than one server the game will approach hyperactive levels of frantic panic faster than you can figure out which minion to spawn. With all the bright colors, pixel explosions, and naturally intimidating sharp objects, it gets pretty freakin' intense. Add to it the slick, hallucinogenic, in-your-face minimalistic style interface that puts in you in a whole 'nother kind of space and you have an experience that sucks you in from the moment you hack the first spam server. Also, the dynamic BGM is all kinds of radical, pumping out infectious tunes that get'n your head and stay there.\n\nI'm a rediculously jaded old-school gamer. I can tell whether I'll like a game before I'm even done with the training level. But I've been following this game for more than a year now and I always find myself playing it for much longer than I'd planned. It's truly a Game in every sense of the word; a unique design that's as simple as it is effective. There's literally nothing but a reticle between you and cyberspace (which may soon be aimed by a powerglove), so it's hard not to get sucked into this abstract realm for minutes, nay, hours on end.\n\nFinal rating: 5/5. Note: This review is of the *single player* experience only.","June 1, 2015","true","373.7"," 24 of 26 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","24","26","0","5"

This game has a lot of potential, like many early access games do.  But as it stands, I'm not gonna recommend it.  Why?  Because all it really has is potential.  Potential, and a lot of circle-strafing.\n\nI can see so many ways this could go that would add depth to the game.  Servers could spawn out terrain chunks or static defenses or semi-random combat puzzle elements.  Hacking tools could provide weird options and recontexualization of combat, like letting you set up warp gates or turn off gravity Matrix-Style, or trade the ability to escape for faster hacking time or something.  Your weapons and programs could let you lock down enemies, subvert control of enemy ICE, or maybe even force a swarm of those little crawlers to merge into a big boss that's paradoxically easier to fight.  Hell, maybe a weapon that targets an enemy, and instead of shooting them, it spawns little target points around it, and does massive damage when you hit all of those.  Challenge vs damage output sorta thing. These are just ideas off the top of my head, mind you, and I'm sure the creator has more than a few of them in mind already.\n\nBut none of these things are in it.  Instead, it's just a shooter where the only real way to fight is circle around and shoot anything that moves.  It's a bit like Doom, if Doom took place on a flat open space, and your guns didn't feel like Thor punching through drywall.  Moving feels clunky when you get stuck on enemies.  Which is bizarre, since there's no other things to get stuck on.  The whole game feels like that.  Empty.  Waiting for something to happen.\n\nAnd I really do want something to happen.  I paid for this game because I love where it could go.  But right now?  Right now, I wouldn't tell my friends to buy this.\n\nI'll revisit this review in a few months, and at least after the full version comes out.  I know a lot will be added and updated.  But I'm not going to say it's a good game yet, just because of what it could be.","August 8, 2015","false","1.7"," 31 of 40 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","31","40","0","4"

The dev is super dedicated, super involved with the playerbase, and super nice. If you're like me, and a good loot system will get you into a game, then I'd highly reccomend picking it up. It's not perfect, but then again, I think you should know that buying an early access game.\n\nThe good:\n-Really good visuals and audio. Very Tron-esque vibe.\n-It's very generous with its rewards. You're leveling up and finding loot very frequently. No complaints about that- I think we all prefer that to when you've got to grind it out for ten minutes just to get one or two guns.\n-It's obvious this is a labor of love. The dev is very active online promoting this game and getting feedback from people.\n-The weaponry has a lot of variations. It really does a good job of encouraging you to mess around with different strategies and loadouts.\n-Did I mention it's only ten bucks? It's a hell of a lot of game for that price.\n\nThe bad:\n-The user interface needs some work. Sorting through your inventory and picking the best stuff is kind of a chore. Also, the menus are kind of small; a lot of them only use up between a third and a half of the space available.\n-The economy needs balancing. Anytime I came across a shop, I had enough money to buy whatever I wanted, and then some, even before I unloaded my extra loot.\n-The stat bonuses you get when you level up also could use some balancing. An extra 1% to accuracy isn't nearly as enticing to me as getting another 15% bonus to loot for the same value.\n-The world feels kinda empty. It's just you, buildings and enemies (which, aside from one spot, only spawn when you're trying to hack buildings.) Some little environmental differences would make a big impact.\n\nOverall, I think it's easily worth the purchase. I feel like I've already gotten my money's worth out of this game, and I'll still keep playing.","December 10, 2014","true","1.3"," 22 of 25 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","22","25","0","1"

What can I say about this game?  For starters, it's a great game just to ♥♥♥♥ around in.  There's no story, no annoying dialogue or bad voice-overs, no character animations, no gun models, no buildings or invisible walls.  "What's so great about that?" you ask?  Well, it's this-- you ever want to kill a spider in your house with a laser but couldn't get your national Government to give you the funds to research and produce a laser that could kill that spider?  Have you ever thought a flying/hovering shark that flung fireballs at you would be a cool thing?  What about neon colored everything?\n\nBlack Ice has all that and more.  Think the randomized gazillions of loot of Borderlands, the action-rpg feel of Diablo and the trippy neon-grid of TRON all had a three-some and somehow all gave birth at once to this game.  You go around hacking systems and killing off bots that appear to prevent you from stealing the precious data from those systems.  Wanna shoot rainbow stars at a giant Scorpion?  Go ahead!  Feel like throwing hammers from a machine gun?  You can find em.  How about Equipping nothing else but server hacking tools, laser and a couple of bots to help you fight and take on 5 different servers at a time?  Yes, you can do that.\n\nPros:\n+ Graphics are beautiful and simple\n+ There's nothing really grindy about leveling up\n+ It's not really tedious, you can take on whatever server and how ever many you want at a time\n+ Loot is plentiful and never hard to come by\n\nCons:\n- Button configuration can get a little cluttered depending what you have equipped where\n- Store menu and inventory menu can be a little tricky to navigate and is probably more tedious than the actual game itself\n\nRating: 207/7, would play cool Cyberpunk-esque game again and shoot spiders with lasers.","September 2, 2015","true","7.0"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","9","9","3","1"

The developer hosts a community stream every Monday (sometimes Tuesdays, when things don't go to plan) and we talk about whatever. We discuss things within Black Ice, things going on with our lives, and more. +1 for interactive developer.\n\nThe game is very detailed, maybe not visually, as it's mainly just low poly meshes and such, but the loot system and statistic area of the game is unbelievable.

You can upgrade and customize almost every aspect of your character, including your attacks, traps, and even your jumps and dashes. Almost every aspect of the toon is upgradable. The game draws inspiration from others like Borderlands  or Diablo, and the loot system reflects this. There is a giant plethora of items and abilities to collect and upgrade, with various rarity and random stats, and modifiers. It's arguable that Black Ice's robust random loot system is already on par with the game's inspirations, which is saying a lot considering that this is still in early access. I can not praise the progression system of this game enough. It is incredibly addictive.\n\nThe aesthetics of the game are striking, and very eye catching, with a pile of visual interest. With that said, it's not perfect and there are room for improvement. The architecture of the digital city is bland, with mostly rectangles with neon outlines. I understand that the game is trying to keep the visuals simple, but that doesn't mean that's an excuse for ignoring all the little details. Bridges, window frames, interesting shaped buildings, street lights, wires, signs, etc, all these sort of accents you would find in any cyber punk city would go a long way for Black Ice, if it wants to keep gamers in awe at it's visuals. The game is not ugly, but once you're past the visual impact of the game, it can get boring to stare at after a while.\n\nAs far as game play is concerned, the shooting itself is fairly par. This could also be said about Boarderlands, but like Boarderlands, it's really the progression system, and the loot grind that will keep players interested. It's certainly my main reason to keep playing. Once in combat, out side of a few random boss encounters, you'll run into mostly the same mobs over and over again. This is probably this game's weakest point at the moment. The game does lack a degree of enemy variety, and because of that, also combat variety, and hopefully this will be resolved in the future.\n\nOverall Black Ice is a very strong foundation that features a very well fleshed out progression system, with tons of potential for custom character builds. The loot random generation is some of the best I've ever seen, and will more than likely be your main reason to keep playing. Though not perfect, Black Ice is a great game, that is already a lot of fun, even at it's early stages.\n\nPros:\n- Fantastic progression system\n- Excellent random loot generation\n- Addictive gameplay\n- Eye catching visuals\n- Great music\n\nCon:\n- Enemy variety is lacking\n- Visuals could use some refining with better detailing\n- Those sensitive to grinds need to be aware this is fairly grindy (in a good way imo)","July 29, 2014","true","13.8"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/the_baka/recommended/311800/","the_baka","Powersocke","http://steamcommunity.com/id/the_baka/","227 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis game is a mix of bright, flashy colours, a ton of loot, a bunch of shooting and a whole lot of eye cancer. And this is why I like it. If you wanna skip the lengthy part of my review and wanna go straight to the pros and cons, you can find them below.\n\nLet's start, shall we?\nAlthough this is an early access game, I bought it. I rarely ever buy early access games and to be frank, it looked boring as hell on the screenshots. But after reading so many positive reviews and watching a video provided by the dev I wanted to try it for myself. So, what is it about?\n\nWell, you're a hacker and you move in a virtual city (you could probably guess from all the wireframe yourself). That city is full of corporations you gott hack in order to level up your mad skillz. Your ultimate goal is to hack the biggest company in town, Finality Corp. This is not only the biggest building but also the most difficult to hack. So your primary objective is to hack as many buildings as you can to level up, get stronger and ultimately face the big-♥♥♥ cybershark, the end boss and dangerous protection software of Finality Corp.\n\nSo, how does the hacking work? You stand in front of a building and press either H or 1 on your keyboard (default controls). Then the hack will begin. Upon hacking enemies will spawn. The higher the skill level required to hack something, the longer the hack will take and the stronger the enemies will be. You get XP by successfully hacking a company's building and defeating the enemies. Be careful though, because as soon as the hack starts, you will be forced to move in a limited area of the hack. Leaving that area causes the hack to be cancelled.\nUpon successfully hacking a building, it will get transparent and you will get loot which you can incorporate into your software to get stronger. The loot that drops is based on your own level.  Also, better hacking devices mean better hacking, keep that in mind.\n\nWhat kind of loot is there?\nA lot. There is a whole bunch of weapons, from machine guns to shotguns, sniper rifles, ice blasts, fire balls, rainbowlasers, laser beam weapons, bombs and so on and so forth. It looks all pretty cool tbh. Then there are minions you can conjure to help you out, additional malware, so to speak. And also there are better hacking devices for you to pick up and a lot of other stuff. A lot of the items will give you passive bonuses on your stats and effectively boost your mad skillz.\n\nWhat can you do with all the loot you don't need? Visit a shop! In a shop, you can sell your unwanted loot for bitcreds and buy better items with bitcreds. But I gotta say, after an hour of playing you'll acquire so many bitcreds that you can buy almost anything in a shop which means the stuff could be a bit more balanced imo. Also, enemies do not drop loot, they only give XP.\n\nSpeaking of enemies, what types of enemies are there?\nWell, there are a few. Stationary towers, a lot of moving enemies, little spiders, big boss spiders, enemies with and without cannons, shields and lasers, scorpions and the like. Looks pretty cool but the enemies lack a bit of variety, there aren't all that many in the game as it is right now.\nLuckily there is a ton of different weapons and skills to defeat them with. The only gripe I've got with it though is the fact that the game's got no weapons models which means you won't see your super cool laser cannon but that's okay I guess.\n\nThe game's got other neat details though.\nFor instance: When you walk up to a company's building you can look for its entrance door and click on it. This door will give you some info on the company you are about to hack and to be honest, it's humorous and I like it. You can also find that humour with a lot of items, for example the "Ghost In The Shellfish"-minion or the "Downloadable RAM"-upgrade. It's pretty nice and it made me smile more than once. Good job.\n\nFrom the technical side of things the game runs well without any performance issues. The only issue being that things can get extremely bright and you will get eye cancer after a few hours of playing. Also some very bright spots can prevent you from seeing the last enemy to defeat to end the hack.\n\nAnd what other game mechanics does this game have?\nWell, you can shoot, walk, run, sprint, jump, use a jetpack to fly, teleport a few meters away and most importantly: hack.\nBut be careful, because everything you do will cost you RAM. You can increase your RAM by leveling up and assigning skill points or by items which give passive bonuses. A jetpack, for instance, needs to heat up which costs a bunch of RAM and the flying itself also costs a big bunch of RAM. And when you're completely out of RAM you cannot jump, fly or shoot or even hack. So keep an eye on your RAM meter.\n\nTo wrap this up, what are the pros and cons of the game?\n\n+ Huge, open world with the option of an ever generating world, making the game endless\n+ Flashy and colourful visuals and nice reflections\n+ Big variety of weapons to choose from\n+ Cool soundtrack\n+ Great character stat customization and fast leveling up\n+ Great challenge with higher tier hacks\n+ A big bunch of cool upgrades for you to use\n+ Achievements to go after\n+ Nice humour and little details in the game as well as a couple of funny references\n+ Bunch of loot\n+ A nice dev\n+ Highly addictive gameplay\n\n- Lacking enemy variety\n- Danger of eye cancer (srsly, dat shizz is BRIGHT)\n- No visible weapon models\n- The amount of bitcreds you get is unproportional to the amount of useful things in the shops or: too much creds\n- Although the colours are nice, the game's look can get pretty monotonous\n- As soon as you approach Finality Corp. the boss will spawn so you can't hack anything near that building\n- The amount of possible songs playing during combat is a bit small\n- The uge world can get demotivating, even on the lowest setting\n- No story (can be a good thing or a bad thing, for me it is a con)\n\nAnd, finally, what I'd like to see in the game:\n\n* Fixing all the cons I just listed\n* To have your very own house or company in the world as a base of operations where you can store your inventory and which you can decorate and such\n* That hacked companies don't get transparent but instead get added to your company, changing colour rather than getting transparent\n* Optional colour filters for the game to change up the look a bit (for instance a filter that paints all the black squares rainbow-ish with flashing colours and the like)\n* A couple new game modes, for instance a survival mode or an arcade mode where you hack only one building but it takes longer with each level and such (or something that has something to do with music and flashing colours)\n* Visible and customizable player model when going to your inventory and/or your base of operations as mentioned above\n* You can equip two weapons at a time, would be cool if the right-click weapon was right and the left-click-weapon was left, I am currently shooting with two lasguns and it's kinda disappointing to only have one beam\n* Make the city more alive with visible data streams and little critters running around or even NPC players doing stuff, combine this with the idea of houses you can go in and the shops and such will get more awesome\n\nI guess I could rant on and on of what kind of stuff I'd like to see in the game if I just thought about it hard enough but I guess I'll stop now.\nSo, that's it.\n\nWould I recommend this game? Absolutely.\nAt 10 bucks? You bet! It can get highly addictive and is a bunch of fun, even in this early state. There is a lot of room for improvement but the way I see it, the dev will sort that out.","January 26, 2015","true","3.3"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","2"

When my friend first approached me about playing it with him, I was skeptical, I admit. I'm not one for FPS games. But Black Ice manages to make weapon collecting a game within itself, and using the weapons is fun and enjoyable. The ideas behind this game are spectacular, and the visuals and graphics can be changed to various styles. Additionally, the soundtrack is phenomenal, always making hackers feel on edge in a world that can sometimes feel very lonely when playing singleplayer. When playing multiplayer, getting better weapons and having the highest DPS feels like trophies in a rivalry with friends. This game makes any player feel like levelling up is worth it and is not just a number.","August 10, 2014","true","22.7"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Black Ice involves you hacking into buildings of various levels which can be indicated by its size. You can hack into multiple buildings at once allowing the user to create a much more challenging experience if they please. For an early access I am very pleased with the results of this game so far and the developer seems to know what he wants to achieve for in the future, and how to get there.\n\n*These are subject to change as the game continues*\n\nPros:\n- Colourful graphics that will not age at all.\n- Fast paced shooter\n- Grinding that doesn't feel like a chore.\n- Several types of gear for you to grind, with unlimited variation resulting in endless possibilities.\n- Large customization to your character through skill points, and different types of items.\n- Rewarding gameplay to those who are good at the game.\n- Options menu has a large amount of aesthetical value to the game\n- Is a pleasing game to the hardcore players, and also casual players.\n- Very stable gameplay with minor glitches\n- Adjustable difficulty allowing you to have an easy time, or extremely hard time\n- Sandbox game with a way to finish the game\n\nCons:\n- The only thing to do in the game right now is hack buildings, and then kill. Could use more depth in that\n- Some guns (including shotgun class) the special effects are extremely hard to see.\n- The UI is a slight letdown, but is getting updated next patch according to the developer\n\nSo as we can see this game is extremely polished for an early access, with fun gameplay.\nI would definately recommend buying the game now, since on full release it will be $20 and not $10, and it will help support this game grow larger much faster in is Early Access stage.","July 14, 2014","true","16.8"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/edgarallanwoah/recommended/311800/","edgarallanwoah","Edgarallanwoah","http://steamcommunity.com/id/edgarallanwoah/","1326 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nDisclaimer:\n\nThis review is done based on a key provided by the developer.\n\nThis game is great.\n\nAlright, so with that nonsense out of the way, let me explain to you why that is the case with this game.\n\nDo you like Tron? Do you like Borderlands? There’s a good chance of that because it compares itself to those two at the tippy top of the store page and you’re here, reading this. So you’re interested.\nThey also aren’t lying by comparing the two and I'm glad they did it.\n\nIf those two had a baby, minus the witty dialogue being shoved in your face, and instead make your own as you swear and soar, you have this game.\nCouple that with a fantastic selection of music that sometimes nearly borders on industrial lite (during combat) and peaceful waltz through cyberland (when not in combat) it’s one of the best indie experiences I’ve managed to have as of late.\n\nThe game can also be compared to old school twitch based shooters such as Quake and Unreal in terms of the speed of gameplay. Sometimes it’s nuts how many things are attacking you on the screen at once and 90% of the time you have direct control of how many things that might be.\n\nThe reason is that the big part of this game is you’re in “The Grid” my words, not devs, and you are hacking the servers that are scattered about, each with it’s own level. And as young cocky me, being new to the game said ‘Oh, I can take on 4 servers that are level 8’.\n\nFun fact: I didn’t.\n\nI was killed quick like a bunny. But I learned, and slowly the game gripped me. I found myself saying ‘One more hack’ or ‘I’ll gain one more level, and I’ll go eat’. Many times I was using a jet-pack to stay away from an enemy for just a few seconds longer so I could use a healing item and not die.\n\nAnd you’ll feel that way too, mostly because that server you were just hacking gets more powerful and a higher level if it manages to smear you all over the circuit board. On top of that it gives you a friendly reminder of your failure by having a big ‘ol skull up on top of it.\n\nThat rightI also said levels way up there. Those are in there for you RPG people. With each kill you get closer to a new level where you get to spend a neat point to make something about you better. If only real life worked that way. There are also perks, but you need to pay attention to what you are using and plan for what you think you want to use as well.\n\nThere’s a story, that I honestly haven’t touched yet. But it’s there, and I plan to do so.\nHonestly, even playing single player I found that it was super easy to drop into my game for 10-15 minutes and then go about my day if needed.\n\nThe game also has some rogue-like elements to it, but despite that, dying never really feels like a return to null. You learn and you move forward, it never felt like it was more difficult than it should be.\n\nYou can enable/disable various visual options as well that give it a nice retro throwback look. Or if you miss when you wanted to dig your eyes out of your head with a spoon because you were staring at a CRT for hours.\n\nI’ve played the game for about 4 hours now, at the time of writing this I am level 15 in the game.\n\nI fully intend to invest a lot more into it as well as try and talk people into buying it. Oh yeah, it has co-op and PVP. So if you want to run around with your BFFs you can while rocking out to Daft Punk and talking like robots. While you’re at it shoot the crap out of that scorpion thing and make it explode into pixel-y confetti and then take whatever it drops to make you stronger. You winner you.\n\nThe devs are also easy to approach and involved. I started live streaming at 0730 and they were in my stream for a while! How cool is that?\n\nSuper Duper Garrett Cooper has managed to take a formula that, to me, has become dry and without flair and injected into it a much needed  boost .\n\nIs the game perfect? No. No game really is, there are bugs (ahaha) But those bugs don't take away from the game at all. If anything they remind you that you're in a big circuit-y neon wonderland.\n\n\n01000010 01110101 01111001 00100000 01110100 01101000 01101001 01110011 00100000 01100111 01100001 01101101 01100101 00100000 01101110 01101111 01110111 00100001\n\n01001100 01101001 01110110 01100101 00100000 01101001 01110100 00101100 00100000 01101100 01101111 01110110 01100101 00100000 01101001 01110100 00101100 00100000 01100010 01101111 01110000 00100000 01101001 01110100 00101110 00100000 00001010 00001010 01000100 01100001 01101110 01100011 01100101 00100000 01100011 01101111 01101101 01101101 01100001 01101110 01100100 01100101 01110010 00100000 01101111 01110101 01110100 00101110","August 18, 2015","true","4.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","5","5","2","1"

The more you hack, the more powerful you get with “software” upgrades that stack up and make more powerful attacks. And you’ll need them to defeat all the crawlers, aimbots and pop-ups that protect the servers. Everytime you try to hack a server they appear and a ring is formed around you. Leave the circle and you have to start over. You can also hack digital shops to buy and sell upgrades.\n\nThere is an almost limitless costumization of your character trough upgrades, getting a lot of different attacks like shotgun, lasers, landmines, companion bots and even a jetpack. This is simultaneously a good and a bad thing, since although it’s addictive you also spend a lot of time choosing between upgrades instead of actually playing, breaking the flow of the game. So many options get too overwhelming, which adds to the confusion of having a billion attackers from every direction of the screen.\n\nIt’s fun but also exhausting and repetitive.

You jump into a procedurally generated "city" of servers (resemble buildings) and must hack them while defending yourself from the various enemies it spawns. Higher level servers will throw more and deadlier enemies at you, but will offer more experience and better rewards. As you level up, you earn point that you can spend on "Talents", which offer a variety of permanent passive bonuses (health, damage, rare loot chance, etc). There are also a myriad of procedurally generated weapons and assorted "pets" (AI drones) that you can summon to fight for you, each with various bonuses and strengths.\n\nFor weapons, there is everything from basic shotguns and machine guns to railguns, beam cannons, disco balls, and TRON-style throwing discs (which return to you like a boomerang). Each of these procedurally generated wepaons can feature all sorts of properties, including drunk-flight, piercing, freeze, slow, burn, zigzag, richochet, explosion (area of effect), bounce, knockback, and more. Want an explosive rocket machinegun with bouncy shots that "colorizes" anything it hits? How about a railgun that pierces through ANYTHING ('buildings' included) that freezes enemies solid? THese and more are just a taste of some of the crazy weapons you will acquire.\n\nVisually, the game has a very Tron-style presentation, with intense neon lighting and a hewalthy amount of bloom. It makes for a visual festival while battling AI minions as they explode into a shower of lights and particles. I also find it easy to spot and track enemies due to the contrast provided by the "neon wireframe" graphics style.\n\nAudio seems to be retro styled, although I feel that this fits the game perfectly. Lasers and bolts have that distinctive "pew pew" to them, while wepaons with explosive properties leave a satisfying boom on impact. Also, the music is catchy, and I often find myself inadvertantly bobbing my head in rythm to the combat tracks. Also, if you find the 'miniboss'. the music shifts to a track that, in all honesty, gave me shivers the first time I heard it (before he obliterated me).\n\nThis is a fantastic game that shows great promise. The developer has been making frequent updates, and also has a separate "in development" branch available (in Betas), with some significant changes to both gameplay and the overall interface (including rebinding all controls). I look forward to future updates and the eventual release of this gem.\n\n","June 21, 2015","true","38.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","1"

A simple shooting game with a tron-like art style. Powering up enough makes you a tank when dealing with entire groups of servers at once, but be careful, not watching your health against harder servers can leave you iced.\n\nDon't complain about the bugs here and there. Should they be notified to the creator? most certainly, and in time they will be smoothed out. The multiplayer servers are not quite stable yet, but singleplayer runs very fluidly. Sometimes jumping wont activate right away depending on where you are standing in respects to a building as well as holding down the charge jump for too long (it is necessary for access to some areas but can easly be abused).\n\nI anticipate more updates and more features as I'm already enthralled by this game.\nHighly recommended.","March 16, 2015","true","23.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

For a game with a simplistic design and mission it is very addicting. I had the pleasure of talking with the dev at RTX  in Austin this past weekend and he was so enthusiastic. It's truly refreshing to see a dev so invested and excited about his game.\n\nThat part aside, I sat down to play it and instantly fell in love. I don't buy that many indie titles but Black Ice is well worth the $15 dollars.  I bought myself and my wife a copy, and 3 friends a copy as well.\n\nAlthough single player is a great way to play, the moment you add in multiple people into the mix over either in-game chat windows or a teamspeak it becomes exponentially more fun.

The art style is cool. Gameplay is tight. Hacking of the servers is pretty original in my experience, and the "get stronger and get better loot to hit harder" gives me the "one more hack... then ill go to bed" kind of denial on how much im enjoying myself. Multiplayer is a blast! Tag teaming servers that are far above both of you and somehow comming out on top feels like youve just co-op'd the 300.\nFirst time i ever hacked a swarm server and saw enemies just pouring over the top of the building i was after actually made me challenge my spray and pray strategy for a moment. I ended up having to turn and bolt as they overtook me. Dropping a mine as i fell back, it smeared those foremost to me that were already full of holes, and bruised up the ones i hadnt tagged yet. After disappearing behind a red building in my hack range, i patiently popped heals and jumped back out, only to come face to face with a lot of digital spiders and some creepy flying monoliths. I Sprinted right past them, turning and blasting as I dropped the speed increase, shotgun and machine gun blasting away and chewing up their digital pixels like candy. They didnt even touch me. Backpeddaling and sighting in on the monoliths as the last of the spiders disappeared, i strafed left to right, dodging what they throw at me as theyve been consistently tagging me the whole time. Near death, I pop heals again, barely saving myself from the Game Over screen. Behind another building i see that only one remains. A quick pop out and he blows into pixels. Yay me :)\nAnyway,that was an epic fight. Ive had plenty of those, even considering the games whopping 2 different enemy types. Enough talk, let me get back to playing this... 85/100. 14 points for repetitive combat and the same 2 enemies. (wait, 3 with the flying shark thing). 1 point because i have already restarted 3 times due to updates.Thank you for God Mode guys!

Played it with him and another friend for a bit, and we all got bored very quickly. Think we got to like level 10.\n\nIt got very repetitive, very quickly, was my main problem. Enemies seemed to have very little variety, other than being big or small versions of themselves. Most unique enemy I saw was a giant flying hammerhead shark that (by the time we saw it) did no damage, but took forever to kill regardless because it had over 57,000 health.\n\nIf you're playing with friends, you're never really gonna be in any danger as long as you stick to things your level, even things about 4 levels above you only present a slight threat when being hounded by multiple people at the same time. And even if you do die, you don't lose anything (or if you do I never noticed), so it's not like you have to actually worry about it.\n\nHonestly, the most entertaining part for me was when I started hacking one of the shops while my friend was buying stuff and then backed up while he got killed. But that was me making my own fun because the game itself had failed to provide me with any.\n\nNot worth $15 to me. Maybe $5.

Like they say, the loot is a lot like borderlands. Seemingly endless build possibilities, quick leveling, and interesting gear make an otherwise monotonous game fun. I say monotonous because at this time there is really no story line or goals (besides taking down corporations). So if you love a grind that stays fairly interesting and challenging (via a very useful difficulty slider) you will probably like this game. Add to all that the fact that since it is a pretty simple game graphically it runs very smoothly. I can't wait to see what features are added in the near future.

You start with nothing more than a basic hacking machine and a pea-shooter. Within about two minutes of playing, you're already too overpowered for Level 3 Hacks.\n\nThis game is simple and easy, but by no means short. There are hundreds upon hundreds of hackable buildings for players to get into, not to mention the very final hack is extremely difficult and you will have to work for it.\n\nOverall, this game is quite nice. The graphics are nice and it runs well on my dinosaur of a rig, getting 53 FPS at the minimum. Also includes different visual effects allowing the user to change between modern visuals and retro pixels. The only downside is that I feel somewhat limited by the abilities I can get.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mcdux0r/recommended/311800/","mcdux0r","dux0r","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mcdux0r/","1067 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis is a game that absolutely gets the most out of procedural generation and random loot generation, and when combined with simple but nice graphics and style, and throw-back hacker feel, you get one hell of a game. The fun in this game comes from slowly progressing and increasing your character as you hack new servers and find ever better ways to combine your abilities, minions and damage.\n\nHighlights\nBlack Ice is a simple game at heart which means it doesn't suffer from many of the annoying problems seen in mechanically similar games. In The Binding of Isaac, Ziggurat and Paranautical Activity, for example, you'll often find yourself tracking through multiple rooms to find something you forgot about, or travel back to get access to a new area. In Black Ice, the radiating positioning of terminals eliminates backtracking, and the jetpack later reduces travel time further. In Borderlands you're often becomes a pain in the butt not being able to hold everything in your inventory and figuring out what you want to throw away, and to then cart it all back to a shop and sell it all, whereas in Black Ice there are actually more drops, but they never get annoying, and are a small reward after each server because after slotting in what you want, you can completely forget about them until you find a shop and one-click to sell all.\n\nThese simple but effective gameplay designs solve small annoyances seen in other titles and really add to the quick pace and play.\n\nThe other half of what makes this title so enjoyable is the fantastic atmosphere and feel. Any fan of Johnny Mneumonic or Hackers who loved that 90s unbreached and new world of computer technology feel will know what I'm talking about and feel subtle instances of connection and nostalgia here.\n\n* There's great mod support and open settings and configuration in general, which is a delight. There is mod functionality and great technical customization out of the box.\n* The progressive, customizable and balanced level up system is done very well and combines with weapons and abilities to make for a depth of strategy in combat approach.\n* The music is wide and plentiful and while it's mostly mild or bland, none of it is bad and some tracks do stand out.\n* While it's hardly worth mentioning, it's so rare that I have to commend the On/Off Switch buttons on the UI showing which state they're currently in, and switching to. For whatever reason this annoys me when it's missing and I click Yes and end up with No.\n\nEarly Access Specific\nMost of my Early Access Specific sections in reviews come with warnings and reasons to be careful, but with Black Ice the developer constantly surpasses expectations and obligations and is clearly comited to making the game better and more immersive in any way he can find. The main planned features which don't exist at the time of review are quests and some level of plot, melee weapons and multiplayer item trading. None of these can reasonably be expected to negatively impact the game, especially in the hands of clearly intelligent and intent developer and other than the niggling possibility of multiplayer introducing a shallow trade-to-win feel, there shouldn't be anything to make you think twice here.\n\nYou can currently pick up Black Ice for £6.99/9.99€/$9.99 and the developer has stated “The game will slowly increase in price up to the full version price of $20 as I add more features. This way, the game will always be a good deal and I'm not punishing people for buying early.” This provides an incentive to buy earlier if you trust in the developer and as a result, the only comment I can pass is that if you were on the fence because of Early Access on this title, you really shouldn't be and now is a great time to buy an already fairly complete game.\n\nMistakes\nDespite the fantastic user rating on Steam and the developers dedication to community feedback improvement, there are still issues and problems worth pointing out here, and they're mostly down to the same thing that makes it great; the simplicity. It helps keep many problems at bay but also results in a lack of variety and it's very easy to get bored with the world as a whole and to become mindlessly numb after repeatedly churning the process of fighting enemies, cycling through loot, bumping up stats, repeat ad infinitum. However, the developer seems to be open to the idea of mini-bosses and side objectives and this may very well be implemented at some later stage which would add some level of variety.\n\n* The difficulty curve is perhaps far too shallow at first and doesn't pick up for a while. It's easy to go 30 or 40 levels without running into many difficult situations if you spend time customizing yourself in the right ways.\n* Multiplayer is likely to change a lot over Early Access, but it's currently very basic and doesn't add much over single player other than being able to approach some enemies slightly differently and trade items.\n\nRecommendations\nCurrently priced at £6.99/9.99€/$9.99 make this cheaper than The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth, but more expensive than The Binding of Isaac Collection or Dungeons of Dredmor Complete, and price matches it with Paranautical Activity, all of which are similar in terms of play time value. So overall the price feels fair just now. There's also a 4-Pack option which brings down the price by somewhere around 25% if you have friends to group buy with.\n\nSince the price is set to eventually double the current price and arrive at $19.99, albeit with a plot, more enemies, abilities, weapons, trading and functionality, it's worth mentioning that I feel it may well be overpriced at that stage, and that waiting for a sale after then may very well be a better choice.\n\n* There's a list of retailers included on the bottom of the website[www.superdupergc.com] and shopping around is advised since the single and 4-Pack options were both slightly cheaper for me from Humble Bundle.\n* There's a free demo available on the website and Steam store page.\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/311800","July 29, 2015","true","10.8"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","2"

(THIS ISN'T EVEN MY FINAL FORM)”\nWill the game be priced differently during and after Early Access?\n“The game will slowly increase in price up to the full version price of $20 as I add more features.

I especially love the dark Earthbound ambience music that plays, but some new battle tunes would be nice, maybe even a dubstep kinda number. Also, it would be nice if the game provided detailed information about each skill, because I did have to go on the Wiki for two of them.

Black ice starts up very quiclky  and has very simply controlls to it. Graphics are ok and gameplay is kinda fun. You can hack many severs at a time and battle waves of enemys . Also when you hack into different severs at the same time the bots battle each other as a result you can see they put some intelligence into the bots. You can use different weapons at the same time when you are in a battle . Also leveling up is very easy in fact, I only play about 6 hours to 7 hours of gameplay and i am almost level 100 .

The environment is pretty simple right now and could use some more diversity or maybe just some more platforming opportunities. There are only a couple types of enemies but the different building types keep it interesting. The weapons are pretty cool with most of them having some fun special properties. There is a pretty nice variety of weapons and the effects almost always make them unique, however, due to the small size of the hack radius, weapons designed for long range single targets seem pretty ineffective. Being able to choose the size and difficulty of the city is nice, but it's almost impossible to become strong enough to hack the higher level structures in smaller cities. The cities also are not saved when exiting the game. Each time you start back up, you have to start a city completely over.

A love letter to the cyberpunk genre enthusiast. The visuals in this game are straight out of the pages of Neuromancer, Snow Crash, and imagery out of Tron and System Shock.

Busting through petty corporate ICE, plundering their data stores while moving onto the next score.\n\nSimple refined gameplay, aim, shoot, move. Statistic customization and different weapon types only enhance a time tested classic style of play; The more you get involved in your character, the more options you have in combat.\n\nFor ten dollars, not too shabby.\n\nHowever, gameplay could get stale after a few hours.

I first heard about the game when it was posted on the Game Development sub-reddit for their "Feedback Friday" thread where developers could post their games and get feedback from other developers on how to make it better.\n\nWhen it first started there, it sucked. I am happy to say that that is no longer the case, and it has come a long way since then. It no longer sucks!\n\nBlack Ice is a great brightly colored FPS shooter with some engaging multiplayer. If you're a fan of cyberpunk, weird aliens and brightly colored pixels exploding everywhere then you'll probably be rather interested in Black Ice. Those who are a fan of randomly generated levels and random item drops would probably also find that this game has a good choice of drops and lots of ways to customize the way you play.","May 16, 2015","true","29.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

'Hack' lesser servers until you level up enough to take on the main server. And how do you do this? With a myriad of lasers. And you'll have lots of time to find your favorite lasers.\n\nProgressing through this game is basically like being a dehyrated slug in the middle of the Austrialian summer in a busy blacktopped walmart parking lot at noon. But they try to keep it fun by adding in a few servers that operate differenly than the usual, and it works.\n\nBear in mind this not the kind of 'hacking' you'll expect. Go to hacknet for actual hacking.\nGo here to spit lasers at bugs and stuff.\n\nShort review as there's not much to say.\nThat also means it lacks a bit contentwise; so let me put it to you this way.\n\nTry the demo. If you like the demo; there's tons to do.\nIf you disliked the demo, you won't see much else.\nCut and dry.\n8/10","September 6, 2015","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That's some kind of an answer. RPG shooter about hacking things - sounds weird, but pretty fun overall. And it works, I played for some time! Might get some kind of a repetitive though, so you might consider bringing your friends into the session. But beware, the thing is still under development!","January 16","true","3.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
