It's very grindy like a cell phone game though. You need coins to buy upgrades and if you're lucky you'll get about 50 - 100 coins per stage after stage 10 with most upgrades costing hundreds of coins.\n\nThings you should know before buying this:\n\n- Controls are very clunky and it has an auto targetting system that can actually screw you up and put you in danger.\n\n- Character / object hit detection is horrible, I've been snagged on some debris and it seems the bottom of the screen is really bad for your character getting stuck on invisible walls.\n\n- Upgrade your attack power as soon as possible, this game is meant for you to NOT get hit during stages as you have to keep a score multiplyer running to get 3 star rankings on each stage.\n\n- Fistnado (the first special you unlock) is the most OP attack in the game, it makes you invulnerable to all damage, attacks foes with a D.O.T. the longer you stand on top of them, and once fully upgraded it lasts 8 seconds... With enough luck you can use it on every screen and clear a stage without incident.\n\nPros:\n\n+ Cool retro references, not just limited to beat 'em up games.\n+ Addicting and casual game play.\n+ Upgrade system is fun.\n+ Star rating system makes you want to perfect levels.\n\nCons:\n\n- Need to replay levels without getting hit and keeping a high multiplier, can get frustrating at times.\n- Not enough variety in battle mechanics. Punch, Uppercut, Roll and Throw... that's it.\n- Clunky game design, lots of hit detection bugs.\n- Too simple, challenge and mechanics wise, not enough depth to the upgrades / game play.\n- Redundent roulette system implemented as a money sink.\n- Gets boring quickly, almost seems like too long of a game for such a simple design.\n\nIt's a quick cash grab for the developer who's objective was to target a niche, dead genre and target those individuals craving this style of game. It's not a bad game, it's just not very innovative or worth your money / time. There's far better beat 'em up games on horizon, it just seems like the timing of this was perfect. It came out right before the release of some really killer beat 'em up games such as RCRU and Mother Russia Bleeds. It worked on me, I'm here to warn you not to fall in to the trap.\n\nIf you must play it, wait for it to go on sale for a dollar or buy it in a humble bundle pack. Again, not a bad game, just really mediocre over all.","January 14","false","5.1"," 25 of 30 people (83%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","83","25","30","3","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SamuraiVader/recommended/357120/","SamuraiVader","Samurai Vader","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SamuraiVader/","4009 products in account","Big Action Mega Fight! is a debut brawler game made by Double Stallion Games. The story revolves around a group of gym friends of which one gets kidnapped... and guess what are you gonna do. Since it has a sonorous name, let's split it into parts:\n\nAction and Fight: It's a brawler without any proper innovation, using the good old formula you already know from games like Golden Axe. You can punch, uppercut or throw enemies, you can roll to dodge enemy attacks (you are even invincible while you are rolling). While it doesn't do many things wrong, some objects has weird hitboxes and you'll notice that your character will weirdly teleport between if they are close to each other and you just keep punching without movement.\n\nBig and Mega: It's a small indie game, with 35 2-minutes long levels. You can count how much playtime you get, if you consider lower difficulty (really low for the two thirds of the game). With this level of (big and mega) exaggeration, maybe you are at least expecting a modest amount of jokes and gags. They are there, but there are only few of them. Also, there's a boundary between jokes and lame references, showing the lazy ideas of developers. Seriously, if you name some enemies after Breaking Bad (TV series) characters, it isn't funny, it's just lazy.\n\n!: For every level you'll get a special ability that you can use after you kill few enemies. Those abilities are always randomly picked (though you can reroll for coins) but you probably won't care - there are few of those all every skill has almost lethal effect. As I mentioned coins, you'll use those to upgrade health, damage, boost drops and special skills.\n\nBig Action Mega Fight could be an average brawler but it ends up short and it gets boring pretty fast, since you'll face about 5 types of repeating enemies, who just get stronger over time. If you aren't fancy for every reference and meme you can see (the game is never gonna give you up), don't buy this. It's not that bad but it's not worth buying, there are many better beat 'em ups.\n\nI believe the developers, Double Stallion Games, can do better, this is a good beginning as the game feels pretty much polished. Just let go some smartphone game habits (concepts) and make something more original and complex.\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: My copy of the game was obtained for free - I won it in a giveaway that might have been sponsored by the developer. This fact hasn't changed my opinion about the game (and the review) in any way.\n\nFor more reviews, join Samurai Vader's Point of View group and follow my curator page, I'm always happy to see feedback about my reviews.","February 26","false","5.8"," 25 of 31 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","25","31","0","0"

Is a linear beat-em up game where you play as a character called ‘Brick’ who has to rescue his friend who got beat up and kidnapped from the Gym.  You will be beating down many enemies who try and beat you down.\n\nPositives:\n+ Lot's of achievements\n+ Lot's of perks and powers to choose and upgrade\n+ Graphics are really good\n+ Lots of humour sprinkled in\n\nNegatives:\n- No windowed support\n- No volume sliders\n- Only one character to play\n- Short stages\n\nI personally enjoyed the game and played it for a few hours. The game revolves around keeping up your multiplier to get a high score to then three star the levels. The game has an abundance of achievements to keep you going through and a lot of levels. My only complaint is some of the stages feel very short and for two hours I have three stared roughly 26/35 levels.\n\nI would’ve loved windowed support as I like to chat on Skype whilst I play games. You only get to play as one character; more characters would’ve been amazing.\n\nOverall though, I had a great time and would recommend this game to most people. I am not a big fan of beat-em ups as I normally suck at them but found this game playable and easy to beat.\n\nScore: Buy.\n","January 12","true","6.7"," 18 of 24 people (75%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","75","18","24","3","0"

Also you will find here a 5 different enemies, for each one you should use a bit different tactic and combat, your charter also can use a some special skills. While you are completing a leves, you can pick up a coins, what you can spend later to upgrade your  health, damage, boost drop, special skill . Beating the levels shouldn´t take to much time from you, avarege you can complete each one in a 3 minute and because this a game enough short, but can be addicting.\n\nThe game graphic is cartoon styled and looks nice. The sound are nice and a music well bring a 90s atmosphere.\n\nSo my verdict:\n\n+nice music\n+steam cards and achievements\n+addicting gameplay\n+good controls\n\n-short\n-no coop\n-only two game modes\n\nSo i think this game really can bring for you a couple hours fun if you play it, however you can complete a game enough fast. The biggest minus of the game  that: you will not find here coop or leaderboard feature, it really can be a good addition for a game. Anyway i think if you like this kind of games you should try this out, especially if its get a bigger discount .","March 11","true","5.0"," 17 of 24 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","17","24","0","0"

It gets way too repetitive, the voices are annoying as hell, and in my opinion, mobile games should stay on mobile (unless they're really good). I just can't see me playing this game, any further.

The controls feel very fluid and responsive (very important is a brawler).  Game runs very smooth for a port and all on screen icons matched my controller's buttons (so no tap this or swipe that icon instructions).\n\nThe Bad: Some levels artificially increase the difficulty by limiting the player's view by having foreground objects (like trees) take up 75% - 80% of the screen.

But if you're looking for a casual beat em up, or want to be introduced to the genre, then Big Action Mega Fight will fill that need for you. The simple mechanics of gameplay are easy to pick up, and easy to play out with simple dodging and a special meter that may charge a little too fast, but allows for you to throw specials around willy nilly. The game gets repetitive quickly, as there's not a good amount of variety in the gameplay. But from a simple visual standpoint, the game works as great characters and animation bring life to battles. The sound design in particular is nice, which was unexpected from a PC port. The difficulty is too easy for my tastes as I prefer games like Phantom Breaker and Double Dragon Neon, but for those who want something a little more simple, a 5 dollar price tag seems to fit the game in question.\n\nVideo Review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oC7KwSpMFU\n\nLists:\n+:\nSimple gameplay with changes that help new players in the genre and makes it easy for them.\nScore chasing elements  are fun, as ridiculous multipliers can be gotten if you play perfectly.\nStrong stylized character design highlights a strong cartoon aesthetic.\nSurprising good game audio for a mobile port. Isolating the sound by turning it off, it's clear you miss it with the missing sound effects of explosions and punches, and the music complements the action rather well.\nPerformance is strong with rare exceptions. 60 FPS with no dips 99% of the time.\nGood references to old games here, obviously pays respect to old, and some new games as well.\nThere's exploding chickens. Who doesn't love exploding chickens? Well, except the chickens them selves. But for them, I don't give a cluck. (I'll see my ♥♥♥♥♥♥ humor out the door)\n-:\nThe game is easy, even for people who may not play a lot of the genre. If you're expecting a challenge, you won't get it here unless you do score chasing.\nLack of variety on a lot of fronts. While the game attempts to ramp up difficulty with more, you'll be fighting the same enemies over and over again. Some of that is the genre, but I feel this is on the wrong side of the tracks on this one.\nLack of enemy variety. When I mean basic gameplay here in the beat em up genre, I mean basic gameplay.\nThe game can be beat in about 2 hours. 35 stages which are really short in several cases (under a minute).\nLack of options from a Mobile port. Basic sound sliders and resolution I would expect as minimums for the PC platform.","January 12","true","3.1"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","56","9","16","2","0"

It has it's charms though. Nice animation, polished flash aesthetics, a pretty good sense of humor, and it's fairly priced. It's not a terribly put together little beat'em up.\n\nSo why didn't I enjoy my short experience? It's too simple. There's not much depth to it's mechanics or it's combat.

The short story is that it’s actually pretty good, and I can recommend the pickup, though there are some design decisions that were made for the smart phone that don’t translate well on PC.\n\nThe combat is pretty good; it has a Guacamelee feel with the throwing of units into other units, while mixing it up with some power-ups that include magical uppercuts, spin to win and more. The problem comes from the level design, levels are incredibly short (1—2minutes) and this at times leaves you feeling unsatisfied at times.\n\nThe game has some RPG elements, at the end of levels you collect money and you can use it to upgrade your brawler. Very basic stuff, increase HP, increase dmg, increase skill damage, it seems pretty balanced for the PC version, I never felt I had to ‘grind’ to get any levels up. One of the poorer elements copied over from the smart phone is how you choose your abilities. You are only allowed one awesome ability per a level, but instead of choosing what you want it goes to a random roll system, now you can reroll it but it cost you money, money that can (and should) be used to upgrade your character.\n\nNow it may sound like I’m bashing the game a lot, but really I had a lot of fun with the game. It has funny pop culture humour, a nice looking art style, solid gameplay and good replay value through a score system. It’s just a shame there’s small things, which were obviously intended for smart phone that don’t translate well to PC. It’s a great first PC game for ‘Double Stallion Games’, and hopefully we see them bring more titles catered towards PC gamers.\n\nGameplay, about half an hour in -  https://youtu.be/48lJLKLtnD0","January 12","true","4.3"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","44","4","9","2","0"

In fact, there will come a day when I recommend a game you hate, or dislike one that you love. I can't promise that I'll always be right, or never be wrong, but I need you to do one thing for me.\n\nI need you to believe me. I need you to trust me. This review can't continue until I make it absolutely, positively, 100,000% clear that I am not a robot. I am not a soul-less husk of computer chips, wires, and circuit-boards. I am a flesh & blood human that is worried about the future. With every passing day, humans are building more robots. These robots are being programmed to take our jobs, drive our cars, and eventually replace us in every way imaginable. You thought it was bad when your spouse discovered Hitachi? In a few years, she's going to have her own robo-Jude Law. That's right, you'll come home one day to find Gigolo Joe himself in your bed.\n\nTo combat this new and overwhelming loneliness, you turn back to videogames. However, due to rapid advances in AI programming, robots will be the ones making all of them. Human game-developers are... too inefficient... too costly. For one thing, humans require sleep, and no matter how poorly this industry treats its workers, most of them still manage to get a few hours of rest each day. With robot workers, we get new videogames every minute. Unfortunately, they're all shameless, effortless, pointless wastes of time. Big Action Mega Fight! is best described as a taste of the future.\n\nThe first warning sign that this is probably going to be a lousy game, is the number of enemy-types. Beatemups are known for repetitive enemies, and every low-life somehow manages to have thirty twin brothers, all with different-colored jackets. However, almost all beatemups have more than five types of enemies. The first stage in the genre classic Streets of Rage 2 has more enemy-types than this game. The bad-guys in SoR 2 also manage to have more than one move. Now that's just crazy isn't it? Robots don't even have a fundamental understanding of how a beatemup should work. All of the enemies have one move each, and they all have the reaction time of a dead skunk.\n\nThe problem with robots is that they don't understand the details. They look at bullet-points. They calculate that if their videogames have all of the features, then they will be considered enjoyable to human-beings. Now let's look at a few of these features. Big Action Mega Fight! has meaningless grinding. In order to strengthen your stats and power-ups, you need money. When you have the money, you can level-up. Leveling up is good, it's like getting a pat on the head, or a nice little treat. That's right human! Listen to this "ding"! Doesn't it sound so very pleasant? A videogame should feel rewarding to play. You're not supposed to get rewarded just because you play it, and certainly not with ridiculous upgrades like +40% damage to power-up that has a random chance of appearing.\n\nBig Action Mega Fight! also has randomness. Apparently we enjoy being surprised. Before each stage, your special ability is randomly selected, and that's supposed to be awesome. If you don't like the power you recieve, you can choose to spin the wheel again for a mere 10 coins. You could also just back out of the level and restart it, but you'd miss out on the opportunity to throw money away. Sometimes the game also randomly decides what enemy you should be punching. Sometimes, you'll just slide into a position in front of the enemy. It's disorienting and doesn't make any sense, which makes it a fantastic idea for this game.\n\nDo you know what else humans love? REFERENCES! Do you love any or all of the following: Back to the Future, Breaking Bad, Rick Astley, Final Fight, Streets of Rage, Street Fighter 2, The Legend of Zelda, and videogames? If your answer is yes, yes, or hell freakin' yes then you are 100% guaranteed to love this game. BAMF! has MEMES as well! Jokes as old as the Internet will never not refuse to be unfunny. Highly advanced robot processors have already determined that you are supposed to like this game, because it makes jokes about Zelda, and it's designed to mimic those old beatemups you're always nostalgic for. Still, I want you to consider this.\n\nHow can a game mimic beatemups of the past, if it doesn't even have boss-fights? There aren't any in this game. Even if the game had a few bosses that were cheap and laughably-programmed, they'd still lend a sliver of variety to keep things somewhat interesting. Instead, the game just ends at level 38.\n\nUnfortunately, robots are incapable of making a fun videogame. When it comes to designing all of the elements that make up a game, they're exceedingly proficient. However, if BAMF! is any indication, a robot's idea of fun is mashing through 38 stages of boring one-dimensional enemies, using one of three moves, and spending a perfectly good weekend leveling a completely useless power-up, just because it's there. There's no challenge, no replay-value, nothing that could draw somebody's attention for more than 10 minutes.\n\nThis is the future Isaac Asimov didn't predict. The robots might not be allowed to kill us, but they can design videogames that are so bland, so boring, so by-the-numbers and predictable, that humanity will lose hope. Big Action Mega Fight! is a perfect example of everything that's wrong with game-design. It's a product focus-tested and overly-designed to the point where only other robots could find it enjoyable.","March 19","false","4.5"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","3","8","0","0"

Excellent sound with some of the tracks taking obvious inspiration from the 16bit god himself Yuzo Koshiro! With the artwork as a cartoon style and similar enemies from the Streets of Rage series, even those dirt bikers from SoRII!\n\nWhile there are 38 levels, they were very short, it is a mobile port, so I can see why. But it plays wonderful letting me complete it in two short stints. Through the first 10-20 stages I was aiming for 3 stars each level, but as the swarms of chickens approach it became very frustrating, something I will look to try on my second play through.\n\nOverall, an enjoyable game, but it could have had a little bit more, still a thumbs up from me, for the nostalgia!\n","March 21","true","3.7"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

I even took a funny screenshot of an upsidedown chicken.\n- One achievement (Yo Dawg) seems to be bugged, so no 100% for this game.\n- Every stage has a score to be beat, in order to get 3 stars. But the score is messed up, cause sometimes it says 600k, and even if you get 2~3 millions you won't get 3 stars.\n- No multiplayer.\n- It doesn't have anything special. It is just a mediocre beat'em up.\n\n+ Controls are ok.\n+ Nice power ups and easy to get coins to upgrade.\n+ Art style is ok, not great, just ok.\n\n\nI would give it a medium review, if we had that.\nIf the bugs were all fixed, it would be a good beat'em up to pass the time.\nBut if you want a serious beat'em up, go buy Double Dragon Neon.","May 14","false","13.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
