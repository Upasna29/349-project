It's basicaly a direct port of Earthworm jim on the PC and DOS. From that you can expect all the problems that come with a port like this. No controller support, complicated keyboard settings, audio issues, slow down and many other things. Personally, you are MUCH..MUCH better off playing the Super Nintendo and Genesis originals, or the Wii virtual console version.\nIf you can't get those then I would suggest Earthworm jim HD for the Xbox live arcade and Playstation network.\nEven if you're a hardcore PC gamer, you deserve alot better ports for a game like Earthworm jim.\n\nDO NOT BUY THIS GAME.","March 11, 2014","false","0.5"," 70 of 87 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","70","87","2","0"

Excellent gameplay, responsive controls, outrageous humor, terrific song and music, and fair difficulty. It's everything you want in a game, something that doesn't take itself too seriously and if you screwed up it wasn't the game's fault it's because you weren't good enough.\n\nSome are present here, however the port wasn't a clean one.\n\nHit detection can be dodgy, missing levels, sounds that just aren't plumb there. Even among the poor ports out there this is probably the worst of the bunch.\n\nIf you want to get Earthworm Jim, I'd recommend the SNES/Sega/SegaCD ports. You're missing out by getting this even if you are a fan of Earthworm Jim.","January 13, 2014","false","0.2"," 31 of 44 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","31","44","0","1"

Buy this game. You can barely control Jim. It's like a normal game, but you have chopped off several random fingers, and struggle to do even the easiest things by squirming and contorting your body in an attempt to do so. This was nothing but a cash grab. The smallest amount of time was put into this version.

Infact it has a bit of everything from many ports of the EWJ games! Heck its using Special Editions soundtrack and revamps the Dos version to something completely different. Sure it may sound like this game is a monstrosity to mankind but Its the best port of Earthworm Jim that is still being distributed. Be thankful that this game can still be purchased to this day!\n\nIn conclusion this port isn't perfect but its probably the best you can get right now at the moment, until interplay/shiny desides to re-release the special edition in all of its glory.\n\nI'd suggest getting this game/collection its well worth your time and money.","December 4, 2015","true","16.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

It's the exact same dos version. Game runs surprisingly smooth and fluid, controls are easy and responsive, graphics and animations look great.\n\nAs for the actual game, this should be a no brainer. I have yet to ever meet someone that dislikes this game. if they havent heard of it, I show them it and they become instantly hooked. Simple, fun, addictive gameplay. Platforming 2D greatness at its finest.\nThe music is also amazing.\nFor me this game has a ton of nostalgia, it consumed most of my childhood along with Doom, Blood, Turok, Sonic, and Spiderman games.\n\nGive it a shot, if you can get it on a super nintendo or a sega genesis that would be a better bet.\nbut this one isn't bad at all, and works perfectly fine. and again I have no clue why the reviews are bad. This one works better than the gog version even! which is rare bc usually gog has the better support.\nThe gog version works the same but the controls get unresponsive if more than 1 button is pressed at a time, some of the animations chop off, and it has a lag that makes it a pain in the ♥♥♥ to control.\nSo if you're trying to pick between the gog version and this one; I'd say give this one a go.\n","January 17","true","0.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Srriously?? What worm wouldn't want to be this guy?  Ne way ...... I didn't have issues running it on my Windows XP system.  It has CD-Quality music, and the controls and gameplay were responsive when I used keyboard or joystick and I completed several challenging levels.  Fullscreen is broken, however (I checked and I couldn't fix it with dosbox).  You will need to use an external zoom app to view it larger.  Also, I found one glitch: at the beginning of the game when you need to launch a cow, make sure the cow is on-screen when you do so, or you'll be stuck, requiring a game restart.  Also, I bought the EJ 1, 2, and 3D bundle.  Although Steam lists the games separately in the library, Interestlingly, when I installed the first game, Steam downloaded the files for all 3 games.  When I installed the others, Steam quickly did a "discovering existing files."","December 20, 2014","true","1.8"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Until the day this review was writen, I've never played an Earthworm Jim game and I haven't sat down to a full run of the cartoon (At least not yet), but for years, Jim here has been a major curiosity to me. It wasn't until recently when I finally decided to get the game. The game itself is great once you find a comfortable enough configuration of the keyboard. The only real nitpick I have with it is that there's no full screen feature! Other than that, the choice is yours if you want to listen to the Negative side of the reviews. I didn't, and if I DID, I wouldn't be here leaving this review, now would I? I may be years late to the party for Earthworm Jim Mania (Much like I was for Sam & Max Mania), but I would sooner spend my entire fortune on a laboratory in the wilderness, swap hands with a demon and call a giant space eel to Earth before I let another year go by without adding him to my growing list of fandoms!","December 24, 2014","true","18.6"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"
