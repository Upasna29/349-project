I do recommend it, but you need to know that it is very simplistic. GA, at it's core, is an arcade game. There are 3 weapons and 3 sub-weapons and that's it. No other mech customization that  I can find.The controls are decent but not super tight and there is no mouse support. The resolution is pretty small and the window in Windowed mode is tiny at 1920x1080. The Story just seems to be the same as arcade but with a wall of text before the level. This is much closer to the NES games it claims influence from than Front Mission: Gun Hazard... which is one of my favorite 2D games of all time.\n\nWith all that said, I still think GA is fun. It's just not deep. The sprites are cool, the 6 guns are quite different, the bosses are huge... It's worth your time, just probably not going to last for a ton of it.","March 6, 2014","true","1.4"," 79 of 94 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","79","94","0","9"

Game's legit.  A few key differences are in how the game controls: unlike Cybernator, while you hold down the fire button your aiming is locked.  Might be an improvement, but it's up to you.  The "dash" move is just a short dash forward, rather than a continuous smooth glide on robo-skates.  That aside, this ought to feel familiar if you're fond of the mech action platformers on the SNES.  I would say most of those games (Metal Warriors, Front Mission: Gun Hazard, etc.) are better and deeper than this, but Giant Army is a fine homage with some slick pixel art and nicely animated sprites.","June 20, 2014","true","0.3"," 26 of 29 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","26","29","0","0"

This might be before your time, but have you ever heard of Cybernator? Target Earth? Gigantic Army is designed much the same way. This is a mech shooter, but not that flashy Gundam Wing crap. The kind where all the mechs fly around looking beautiful, while J-POP plays in the background. This is more along the lines of The 08th MS Team. The best words to describe it are a mixture of CRUNCHY and CLUNKY. Let's call it CRULUNCHAKY.\n\nUsually an action game being called CRULUNCHAKY is a bad thing, not so with Gigantic Army. All the mechs in this game have weight. Within seconds of starting the game you really gain an understanding of how the MECHanics work. Every movement in this game is calculated, and playing effectively is knowing when to "lead" enemy fire away. Raw reflexes are fine, but your mech is a bit too slow, heavy, and bulky to make those tight dodges. For the most part, enemies aim their guns at you when they fire, and larger mechs have a plethora of weapons they cycle through. Truly understanding this game requires predicting every possible attack, and then moving into position to do the full amount of damage. The nice thing about all that I just said, is that it's alot easier to figure out in-game. Gigantic Army has a natural level of difficulty. If you play smart and don't rush things, you'll get far.\n\nUpon starting the game you get to choose your primary and limited secondary weapons. What you choose decides your style of play. Do you want good crowd control, don't mind long mini-boss fights, but want to finish end-bosses quickly? Go with the spread shot and laser cannon. For anything that gets too close you've got a pile-bunker. Expect the jump, hover, and dash abilities to see a lot of use as well. When all else fails, bring up the shield to block enemy bullets. An important thing to keep in mind, is that you can't block while jumping. Think of it as a commitment, choose one that suits the current situation.\n\nUnlike Target Earth aka Assault Suits Leynos, the missions in Gigantic Army don't have any real objectives. There's no escorting, protecting, or any of that nonsense. Reach the end of the stage, and destroy everything in your path. There's a time-limit to keep you focused, power-ups along the way, and occasionally there are mines. The bosses are well-designed. Some move around a lot, others rely on their superior firepower, and there are even a couple unique fights. This game moves and ends very quickly. If all you want to see is the ending, this game will last about as long as the average 16-bit action game.\n\nBut that would be too easy wouldn't it? Upon completing the normal difficulty you'll unlock hard, and eventually insane. Enemies pack more firepower, you'll run into some new mechs, and the action gets hotter and heavier. Also you're expected to bring your SSS game if you want to get those high-score achievements. Move fast, don't take any damage(NONE), and kill everything. Sure it might be what you've been doing since you started the game, but you've got to do even better.\n\nGigantic Army is a very solid game. I highly recommend it to fans of the aforementioned mech-shooters, but really anyone can enjoy it.","November 15, 2014","true","1.8"," 30 of 37 people (81%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","81","30","37","3","0"

Though I did enjoy some aspects of this game, and I really would want to like this game as a mecha fanatic, I just can't recommend it due to some bad game mechanics:\n\n1) TIME LIMIT - You control a slow moving mech and you start off with little time. The ONLY way to add time is to find containers with T powerups around the stage, but you're not encouraged to explore since you already start off with little time. Enemies don't even drop powerups, so if you took too long against that sub-boss and took too much damage well then good luck with the rest of the stage.\n\n2) NO CHECKPOINTS - When you die, you only have 3 continues. And when you continue, you start at the way back at beginning of the stage.\n\n3) DAMAGE CARRIES OVER THE NEXT STAGE - Although you do get healed at the end of a stage, the amount of healing however depends on your score. So not only do you need to watch out for the time, you're also going to worry about taking as little damage as possible while worrying about killing as much enemies as possible to increase your score and increase your healing for the next stage.\n\n4) MOVEMENT PROBLEMS - Yes I know you're controlling a mech, so it makes sense it moves slow. But in Gigantic Army's case, it's a bit too slow because of the time limit. You can dash, but it's very short and it's inputted via tapping forward twice that doesn't respond well. And no, there's no dash hotkey. There's no double-jump, but instead there's a booster to let you fly for a few seconds as long as you have fuel. Fuel regenerates quickly, but its tank capacity could be higher. Some platforms can't be reached unless you have a full tank, which means you'll have to wait for a while for it to fill up before you jump. If you make a mistake and failed to reach a platform, you'll fall and have to wait for the fuel tank to replenish before you try again so that's precious seconds wasted. And finally there's no "jump down" from platforms. So if you see some powerup boxes below a platform, you'll have to walk all the way to the edge to fall down then walk underneath the platform. And it sucks if those boxes didn't have any Time powerups, so that's time wasted.\n\n5) CANNOT CHANGE WEAPONS IN BETWEEN MISSIONS - When you start a game, you get to select 1 main weapon out of 3, and 1 special weapon out of 3. That's the only time you get to select a weapon. It could have been nice if it was like some space shooters that allow you to change weapons after a mission.\n\n6) SPECIAL WEAPONS HAVE LIMITED AMMO - You get to chose among 3 back weapons: Cluster Bomb with 12 ammo, Missile Barrage with 6 ammo, and a Beam Cannon with 2. Unfortunately you cannot pickup ammo for them, so you'll have to save them for bosses or large enemies. And if you miss, too bad. They do replenish at the beginning of the mission though.\n\nLike I said I really would want to like this game, but these game mechanic problems just prevent me from doing so.","February 14, 2015","false","1.3"," 43 of 61 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","43","61","0","2"

I do, because back then I lived in a house. Apparently almost every indie developer remembers the 90's as well, but I digress. But unlike most of those games that look like a strange pixely butchery of what SNES and Genesis games actually looked like, Gigantic army looks like something you could actually get in cartridge form, which is neat.\n\nGigantic Army starts in the year 2009, the same year I found out who my real dad is, and then regretted finding out who my real dad is. Humanity, having discovered warp travel at the turn of the 21st century, goes about it's business doing what humanity does best. That is to say tenderly loving any other species that happens to get in our way.\n\nYou are a pilot of an MCR, that's a fancy name for giant robot that may or may not be a VOTOM. Your duty as the ground pounders of the Terran Defense Force is to drop on the home planet of the Romulans,  I mean the Ramulons, I mean the Klingons, no wait I got it the second time.\nI think.\n\nAt the start of the game you choose a main weapon and a special weapon before going about your business of killing everyone that doesn't look like you. And what you get for this is a pretty sweet side scrolling mech game that should probably be on a MS-DOS PC or a Super Nintendo.\nSeriously, they even got that whole Mode-7 thing going on, it's really cool.\n\nI'm told the game plays like Cybernator or Assault Suits Valken, two games I've never actually played before because I live behind a convenience store and yell at passerby's. What do you want from me?\nBut like a SNES game, it's short but kind of challenging. It can be beaten in around an hour or so if you don't constantly get your teeth smashed in by one of the few cool bosses that out class you in every way but still get punched into mulch by your MCR's giant piston wang.\n\nYour MCR, the Saladin  At least I think it's the Saladin, I only got the name from a trading card and it's on the game's cover , moves like a giant battle robot should. It's clunky, heavy, and makes a satisfying BOOM whenever it lands on the ground. It's also slow and only has a short quick-dash to get from place to place a tad quicker.\nYour weapons can include an assault rifle, a shotgun (called the riot gun), and a grenade launcher as well as your choice of missile spam to ruin someone's day.\n\nBut should you play Large Posse?\n\nFor 6 dollars? It's not that bad, I'd say get it on sale though. If you're hankering for some good ol fashion 90's mech shooting, then here you go. It's a SNES game in PC form, the story is simple, the gameplay is easy to pick up, and the bosses are pretty cool. It's a time waster if anything.\n\nGrand Gang get's 5 VOTOM's out of 6 Robotechs.\n\nJohn Cena is probably going to win Wrestlemania again.\n\nThe Curator: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Dickbuttexperience#curation\n","March 8, 2015","true","1.3"," 29 of 38 people (76%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","76","29","38","18","0"

I'm shooting for a 1CC so I'm denying myself continues and am getting about half-way through level 4 on Normal mode.  Given that I've only put ~2 hours in to it this game appears pretty easy for a shooter but I've still got two difficulty levels to unlock and get smacked by and if the game is anything like Satazius the differences in difficulty levels should be pretty extreme (Satazius has extra bosses for example).  The mechanics are rock solid and the control is tight.  Music is ok but nothing to write home about and the game isn't exactly overflowing with extras but you get the main game, four difficulty levels, a practice mode to refine your skills, and 3 main weapon choices along with 3 subweapon choices.  If you, like me, decide to shoot for a 1CC and work your way through the ranks the game will probably give you about ~200 hours of gameplay but if you, like so many others, credit feed (you are locked in to the starting credit plus 3 extras and I'm unsure if there is a way to add more) and then plan on whining about the games length you won't have a good time but this game wasn't made for the latter anyways.  Shmup fans rejoice, 7.5/10 (Rating primarily determined by fun factor with a 10 being Battle Garegga, Rayforce, or Raiden DX and a 1 being any of the Exceed games or Sol Divide)\n\nEdit: I must not have been in the zone earlier and I was certainly out of my element playing on my 10 inch Asus T100 tablet with the docked keyboard but when I jumped on my desktop with my 360 controller in hand I dominated.  Then, I further dominated when I tried the one primary weapon I had yet to test, the grenade one, which happens to be way overpowered.  Now, being overpowered isn't a bad thing necessarily for two reasons: 1. I'd prefer the game to be built with one weapon in mind, the selection was actually an annoyance for me so from now on, unless I want to intentionally increase the difficulty, I'll just use my setup and not give the setup screen a second thought;  and 2. these games tend to be considered very difficult so perhaps me finding the game easier will be a plus for many out there who are unfamiliar with run and guns or simply want a more accessible one.  But, I still feel the edit is necessary because these changes drastically affect my estimated play time which I will attempt to update with concrete fact as I approach my 1CC's.  I plan on not editing the original posted body of the review in order to maintain a standard of accuracy and provide full disclosure of any mistakes that I may have made.\n\nEdit 2: I finished my 1CC of Normal after about two hours of play that amounted to maybe six attempts.  I find that to be way too easy for my liking but I'll still move on to Hard next and give it a go.  My all clear was done with the Grenade Launcher and the Missiles (whichever the middle option is) for a score of 4,738,644 which I've posted to the Community Hub.","March 6, 2014","true","2.0"," 31 of 44 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","31","44","0","3"

This is not exactly the most inspired of concepts, but the execution here is intelligent and crisp, with intuitive aiming and strafing mechanics that make for a much more skill-focused game than you might expect.\n\nCarrying the old-school action theme even further, each level is timed. You can (and really should) pick up Timer extension power ups along the way, along with health and damage boosters, but even so, between the enemy forces and ticking timer, you're gonna die more than a few times. Completing a stage merely gives you a tiny health boost, not a full heal, so it's strongly recommended you not let any items pass. You only get three continues per game, an absolutely archaic system to include in a game released in 2014, but it fits well enough and feels natural. Stranger still, while the story blurbs you receive between levels are painfully low-budget, the actual story and writing they throw at you is honestly pretty enjoyable. Regardless, Gigantic Army is a game that'll hit you with a few Game Overs before you manage to take out the final challenge (particularly on the brutal higher difficulties), but you'll enjoy every boss pattern learned and inch of progress acquired. If you're a fan of the old-school, this one's been whipped up just for you.","August 10, 2014","true","3.7"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","13","14","0","0"

It’s a bit frustrating when you have to spend a minute getting yourself killed so you can quit.\n\nNext is the fact that you are timed. Now I know its ok with some other games, like metal slug 3 (a great game by the way) but in this your mech is very slow and having a time limit doesn’t really mix. Also they have a time booster that adds 1 second.\nI really don't see the point of this as you probably used 3 seconds collecting it.\n\nNext are the controls (note I’m reviewing these based on using a 360 pad/controller) which are bindable but not to every button. For example I wanted to set the shoot function to the left trigger but it just did not work. It also does a pretty bad job at telling you what stuff does, like how instead of saying shoot, jump etc. it just says button 1, button 2 and so on.\n\nAnother thing that's done a bit poorly is, that there is no saving your game. Or if there ever was a way, the game doesn’t tell you about it. And if you can't save, you’re going to have to beat the whole game in one go.\n\nAlso, judging by the steam page the game is not that long at all, as I beat 2 levels out of 6 in 6 or 8 minutes. I know this because of the timer counting down.\n\nSo in the end, even though I enjoyed it, I am not recommending it , as steam has waay cheaper games that are more fun, longer and better in my opinion(since it’s an opinion, feel free to make up your own mind, if you buy the game). And even though I got over the game’s faults, I think a lot of people will just get way too frustrated to make it worthwhile.

The sound design is pretty bad, There is no audio in the "story" bits, the main menu or company screens. UI lacks some sounds as well.\n\nThe game has bad visual design for everything but the main robot you play, the partical effects and the explosions.

The time limit is strict and makes you rush the level making mistakes. So rather then actually designing enemies or bodded to be hard; they used a clock to create artifical difficulty.\n\nThe weapons are unbalanced.

Unfortunatly it doesn't really live up to some of my favorites like Metal Warriors, and Cybernator since the controls seem a bit clunky. The 'robo-skates' is only a quick dash move instead of a smooth glide, you can't change your angle of fire unless you stop shooting (which makes it nearly useless against moving targets), and some of the weapons (both regular, and special) are pretty worthless.\n\nAll that having been said, I do like the graphics, chip-tune soundtrack, and how smooth most of the animations are. The melee attack is interesting in that it auto-activates when something is near enough to be hit, and the gauges showing health, shield health, and your jumpjet fuel are all well placed. I think I will try waiting a bit to see if they smooth this out a bit more in the near future and go from there.","March 6, 2014","false","0.4"," 41 of 76 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","41","76","0","9"

Your jumps too,  also feel heavy and weighed down, even with your jetpack which allows you to continuously ascend further upward by holding down the jump button. All your weapons (including the proximity based melee attack) are balanced in some way too to be more methodical in use, some having brief reload times or requiring to be precisely fired with your 360 degree aim. You also have a ground dash, but it has quite some acceleration and must be used carefully. Lastly,  there's the shield which can block enemy fire, but using it requires careful timing and planning as it cannot be brought up mid air, or immediately after landing or firing.\n\nDo these limitations make Gigantic Army feel slow paced? Not at all. GA shows that player move speed and pacing are two completely different things, and that seemingly cumbersome controls can feel profoundly smooth once fully mastered. While your mech may at first seem like a big clunky hunk of junk, mastering the subtle physics and techniques of jet packing, landing, and dashing will allow you to pull off rad dodges and close calls as you blast enemies.\n\nThe level and boss design is also quite solid, with the bosses being a major highlight and the most enjoyable part of the game. The levels offer great variety, making up for your slow move speed by being tailored around quick dashes, jumps, and fending off enemies from both sides. They also do a great job of mixing things up with frequent mini boss encounters. The bosses, especially the later ones, are the real show stealers though. Each of them has a number of attacks which are tricky to dodge whether on the ground or in the air, and will have you weighing the strategic benefits of attempting to out space them on the ground or out maneuver them in the air, two options that require very different technique but are both challenging and rewarding.\n\nThe game does a good job in terms of replayability, too. There are two extra difficulties, which feature much more challenging bullet dodging action, and the game has a scoring system in which you are rewarded a bonus for how fast you can speed run stages. Each of the three available weapons also causes you to use a slightly different playstyle, so attempting to master the game with all three should add a lot of replay value for anyone who enjoys the game enough to do so.\n\nI generally prefer more nimble, ninja like controls for my action games, but Gigantic Army shows that a methodical, heavy metal shooter can provide an awesome change of pace.","August 23, 2014","true","13.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","4"

I played a lot of Cybernator and Metal Warriors back in the day on my SNES, and those two rank up there as some of my most favorite games.  I played Gun Hazard when I discovered emulation in the late 90s (I had previously played through Front Mission 3 for the PS1).  I tried Assault Suits Leynos (Target Earth in the US) on a Genesis emulator once, but couldn't really get into it.\n\nSimply put, this game delivers, especially for the price point.  I don't think I'd pay ten bucks for it unless it had more content, but at six, it's just right.  And a Steam sale would make it even more attractive.  You get exactly what it says on the box - old-school mecha blasting action that scratches that 16-bit itch.  It just doesn't do anything to innovate or move the genre forward in any meaningful way.  But that's OK because hey, bargain bin entertainment.\n\nThe action is non-stop.  This is partly due to a timer, which forces the player to move forward or risk losing the mission.  But there are also "reinforcements."  Enemies might respawn forever, but it's not worth finding out as time continually is running out.\n\nPlayers choose one of three primary weapons, and one of three special weapons.  The primary weapons feature five upgradable power levels and unlimited ammo.  The secondary weapons are ammo limited based on the primary weapon.  So for instance, if one chooses the assault rifle primary and the beam cannon secondary, there will be three shots of the beam cannon.  If one picks the grenade launcher primary, the beam cannon will only have one shot.  I found this balances the weapons rather nicely, and was pleasantly surprised it was balanced so well, given that there only appear to be two people invovled in making the game, with maybe two additional play testers.  There is no one "best" option, as all choices seem to be suited to particular styles of play.  I've found, for instance, that the shotgun and missile pack are the easiest for me to use.  The downside is the player is stuck with one loadout for the entire game.  It would've been nice to switch it up between missions.\n\nThe graphics look nice and fit with the 16-bit aesthetic the team was going for.  I think in this day and age the explosions could look a little less like they were cut-and-pasted from an explosion generator app, but they get the job done.  The backgrounds are especially well done, with the first few levels even having some cool battles happening in them.  Some of the enemies do look a little rough, though, as if the artist was rushed and didn't have as much time to polish them as much as others.  As a result there are times where the graphics do not look coherent, and it can be rather unsettling.  I noticed this in Satazius, too.  I also am not a fan of animating the sprites using rotation, rather than an actual animation sheet.  I can't quite put my finger on it, but it just looks strange to me, almost like really bad CGI in low-budget SyFy Channel movies.  I understand why the developers do it this way, I just wish they had the resources to build traditional animations.  The game would look so much better.\n\nThe sound effects are a mixed bag as well.  Most of them are well done and fit with the aesthetic, however there are some sound effects that seem really out of place and tend to break the coherence of the aesthetic.  The music, on the other hand, is great.  It's energetic without being overwhelming.  It blends in well with most of the sound effects and never seems to swell out of control or get annoying.  It's a little more advanced than the standard MIDI-type music of the SNES, but I'll let that slide as it does such a great job of setting the mood in each stage.\n\nControls are very reminiscent of Cybernator.  They are fairly easy to learn, but like that game it takes some time to master them.  The character responds well to input and even though there is some clunkiness built in to help simulate moving a large hunk of metal, it is still easy to get around the enviroment, dodge bullets, and maneuver around enemies.  The only real complaint I have is the double-tap to dash mechanic.  This seems like a terrible move on the part of Astro Port, considering Cybernator and Metal Warriors both used one of the face buttons to activate the dash.  Given that there are only six actions (fire, jump, shield, switch weapons, pause, and screenshot), and modern controllers have plenty of buttons, they certainly could've put the dash on a button.  I don't like it when basic controls involve some kind of skill.  The double tap is kind of finicky and difficult to time correctly, and almost impossible with the analog stick.  If they do a sequel, I hope they fix that.\n\nThe length of the game is just right.  Once you get good at it, it takes a little over a half hour to 1CC the game.  I know we live in the age where everything is supposed to take 40-60 hours to complete, but as a dad with two kids, I just don't have that kind of time anymore.  Sometimes I just want to sit down and blow stuff up for a few minutes after dinner.  The old 16-bit games were all like that anyway.  Plus for six bucks, you shouldn't be expecting Final Fantasy-length engagements anyway.\n\nLike Satazius, there are four difficulty levels (Easy, Normal, Hard, and Insane), with Hard and Insane being unlocked upon completion of Normal and Hard, respectively.  The difficulty ramps up nicely, with enemies firing more aggressively and environmental hazards increasing.  I never felt like it was unfair or overly difficult.  Careful and skillful gaming will get one through, as well as choosing the weapon loadout that works best for your playstyle.\n\nOverall I really like this game.  I like Satazius, too, and I hope Astro Port continues to make these great homages to the classic 16-bit era.  I would even be willing to pay more, say $10-$15, if they would incorporate some modern touches like unlockable extras, more weapon choices, longer stages, maybe a progression system, and alternate endings.  I mean even the old school games tended to change the ending based on difficulty.  If you're fan of the old school, especially the 16-bit era games, you owe it to yourself to pick this up.  I don't think you'll be disappointed.","March 16, 2014","true","9.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

(But you can simply continue a few times and that second issue becomes largely irrelevant.)\n\nWould be nice if you could set it to run at your native screen resolution, and it would just scale things, too. Also don't really see the point of having a screenshot button on my gamepad.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/reaperlord/recommended/278930/","reaperlord","ReaperLord","http://steamcommunity.com/id/reaperlord/","156 products in account","What could have been a great mech game has been dragged down by baffling design decisions. Aiming your main weapon is a pain since it moves so slowly. Mouse control aiming really would be a much better idea than keyboard aiming, because the mouse can be far more precise. Your mech is so big and slow, that even though it looks like a tank it has the durability of a tin can. Health pickups are available, but they only give a tiny amount of health for the big "H" pickups and a trace amount of health from the small "H" pickups. On beating a level a portion of your health is replenished, determined by your score. Your shield takes a bit of time to bring into position and while it can take some hits each level, its hit points are only replenished (to 100%) after you beat a level.\n\nWhile your special weapons can be powerful, they have a tiny ammo supply. There are no special weapon ammo pickups in the game. This is made worse since the main weapon determines how much special ammo you can carry, with the assault rifle giving a mabye tolerable amount of ammo, while the grenade launcher gives next to nothing. On top of that, each special weapon has a different ammo capacity, even with the same main weapon.\n\nWhile there is a short range dash for your mech, sometimes it will work, but quite often it just doesn't. There is also no key mapped for the dash, compounding the problem. You have less than 5 minutes to start out with each level, and if you go over the time limit, you quickly die, and have to use a continue (of which there are only 3), taking you back to the very start of the start of the level you died in, but at least they have the decency to refill your shield, health, and special weapons ammo. There are 2 pickups to increase your time limit, but they only add 30 and 15 seconds to your timer. The time limit is simply too little for such a slow mech and a spotty dash mechanic. This strict time limit encourages you to go as fast as possibly through each level, maximizing how much health gets replenished on beating a level.\n\nYour mech is equipped with hoverjets, which allow VERY brief flights. While the jets' recharge rate is decent, the fuel capacity is pathetic. Platforms will occasionally have boxes containing health, time, or a weapon powerup, but given the strict time constraints, you'll barely have the time to make opening said boxes worth it. Speaking of pickups/powerups, enemies will NEVER drop them, even bosses. One stage requires a bit of exploration, but that it makes no sense when paired with said strict time limit.\n\nThe music is quite forgettable, there are no voiceovers, the story is told through a scrolling text pad before each level, and there is no level select.\n\nToo long didn't read version: The time limit is way too strict, your mech is as slow as molasses in an igloo, pickups are few in number and weak in effect, and you barely have enough health to ever finish a level. There's difficult, and then there's unforgiving. This game is the latter.\n\nFinal score: 25/100 Avoid this game","December 24, 2015","false","2.7"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/recommended/278930/","Maxmetpt","Maxmetpt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/","704 products in account","Gigantic Army is a 2D sidescrolling shooter that stays very true to the old NES style of games, not just in its presentation, but also in principle. While it doesn't do anything innovative, it's very competent at what it tries to do, and will certainly satisfy you if you're into this "retro" movement.\n\nThis game rewards flawless play and is very punishing if you don't pay attention to what you're doing. As it is a Mech game, movement is slow and methodical, and you need to think before acting, since you can't quickly move or stop any action.\n\n\nPresentation.\nTo be honest, while I recognize that it's trying to look "retro", I don't like the way this looks at all. It's very colorless, the low resolution doesn't scale at all and it's very rough around the edges. It was made by only two people, if I'm not mistaken, but overall, I think it looks pretty poor. The enemies and Bosses look pretty cool, though, but the backgrounds' color and textures leave a lot to be desired...\nBut hey, it does look old, if that's what they were going for. Instrusion 2, for example, looked much tighter. Or Bleed(even though I didn't like the aesthetic very much), for example.\nThere's too much green/brown to my taste.\n\nThe Music is an interesting aspect. While I don't think it's very good, I think it totally fits the balls to the wall mech combat typical of the 90s. Very strong bass, actually! It sounds a bit amateur and doesn't really pack a punch, but I still appreciate it a lot for simply being there, weirdly enough, mostly for the feeling it manages to convey.\nThe SoundEffects, I found awful. They were very generic and repetitive, louder than everything else, and ended up being very annoying. There are sound options, but the sound-effects seemed to ignore the scale, and the only noticeable difference was between 0 and the rest.\n\n\nNow, let's talk about the game itself and Mechanics.\nThere are 5 levels, and it wouldn't be an old-school game if you didn't have to beat all 5 of them with 3 continues, in one sitting. Oh yes. And you have a time limit per level! Granted, it's not a very long game (30-45 minutes, maybe?), but it's pretty challenging to do it nonetheless. Also, each time you die and use a continue, you'll start from the beginning of the level, with your score reset and lose all the power-ups (but regenerate life and shield).\nYou first start with 2 difficulties unlocked, Easy and Normal. You can unlock Hard by beating Normal, and Insane by beating Hard. I'll talk more about the difficulty changes later.\n\nAside from difficulty unlocking, each run is self contained. There's no progression at all outside each run. And inside them it's just tied to weapon power-ups and score.\nWhen you start a game, you pick your difficulty, and then have a choice for a primary and secondary weapon. There are 3 of each, one of each tier. The primary weapon has infinite ammo, but the higher tier you pick, the less ammo you'll have for your secondary weapon. PW are an Assault Rifle, and Spread Shotgun, and a Grenade Launcher. SW include a Frag Grenade, a Missile Barrage, or a Single Laser Beam from freakin' Hell. No bias towards the beam at all, here.\n\nFor example, with the Assault Rifle you'll have 3 Beams, with the Spread Gun you'll have 2 Beams, and with the Grenade launcher you'll only get one Beam. This number is per level. When you beat a stage, your weapon will recharge.\nOnce you pick them, you'll have to stick with these weapons.\n\nYour mech has an Health Bar, a Shield Bar and an Energy Bar. You can use the shield only when not moving/shooting, and each time you defend against something, the bar lowers. If it reaches its limit, you'll lose the shield for the remainder of the stage. Your Energy is consumed when you use the jetpack, but it recharges quickly. These two aspects are essential for you to plan whether to dodge and keep shooting, or simply defend, playing safely.\nKilling enemies simply grants you Score, but there are crates throughout the stages that drop Health, Time, and Power. Power upgrades your main weapon (more damage, rate of fire, etc.), but you'll lose it when you get hit. Remember when I said it punished you? Yeah. Not getting hit will make you even more powerful, making this a very methodical game.\n\nAside from this, it's a basic shooter. Enemy variety is pretty good, and there are 1-2 mini Bosses per level, with a bigger Boss at the end. Everything has a pattern that you have to learn to master this game. And if you're into this kinds of games, you'll certainly enjoy beating the game several times with different loadouts and difficulties. The achievements are here to reward you for beating the game with high scores, without using continues and so on. It also encourages trying different weapons, and hints at secrets, so I have nothing to complain there.\n\nNow, about the difficulty. What I wanted to say, and it is something I highly appreciate, is that difficulty isn't tied to numbers, in Gigantic Army. Higher difficulties change enemy behaviors, and even introduce new enemies. This is really good design, in my opinion, and something that I rarely see. Playing on Hard doesn't just make you be more careful, but actually changes your strategy, since the patterns are harder.\n\nPersonally, I enjoy these games a lot, but I prefer faster gameplay, rather than the slow mech. This isn't a fault of the game, though, as it achieves exactly what it sets out to do, but I think it's worth mentioning. If you like fast gameplay, you won't find it in here. The game is sluggish, intentionally so.\n\nAlso, the game feels a bit dated, from a design standpoint. It's designed with the old-school mindset, and while it worked before, it doesn't stand quite as well, nowadays. This is regarding the lack of progression, and there being only 6 weapons in total. The game Bleed did things differently, in which you could get upgrades, and more weapons (that were VERY different from one another) outside of the levels, and thus gave it more replayability. The game also focused more on reflexes, and movement had more depth to it, in my opinion. But I digress.\nThose weapons only hold my attention for so long, it would be cool to have more, and even unlock some. Another issue, it tied to beating the game with limit continues, and in one go. I think the developers should give players the option to save. Keep the achievements for beating it without continues and perhaps without saving, but not everyone is into that. So just put that option in there, why not?\nI believe the game would benefit from these more "modern" option, especially for audiences who aren't that familiar or fond of old games. And options wouldn't hurt, would they? Well, this is just my view, but it's not a very big issue at all.\n\n\nI think I've covered everything I wanted to talk about. Even though it didn't hold me for too long, I think this game is pretty good. Limited, sure, but I think it does exactly what it wants to do, and it does that very well. It's not a game of mass appeal, but if it seems like your kind of game, give it a go, you won't be disappointed!","November 23, 2014","true","4.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It is pretty hard but with some practice I rapidly managed to get deeper and deeper in the game. Three different main weapons and three different special weapons allow you to use what you prefer. You can't change weapons mid game though so the pickups only give you time, health or upgrade your main weapon.\n\nIf you have to continue you lose all your power ups and so the game get harder but not impossible since there are usually a lot of pickups in each stage. Stages are long enough and they all feels a bit different and fresh with a good number of different enemies sprites.\n\nI was playing with a xbox controller and it feels good. The hardest part is to remember that you can't aim while shooting. May be better to wait for a sale if you are not the biggest fan of this kind of game but it's worth a try.","August 7, 2014","true","0.5"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

The game style itself lends itself strongly to a homage of Cybernator.\n\nAnd this is where the good points end, the gameplay is too reminisent of Cybernator, which I would not count against it if the controls were good, they are not.\n\nThe dash mechanic in the game is very short and does not have a dedicated button to engage on it's own.  This is a minor point  compared to a more glaring one is that your forward momentium is NOT preserved when jumping in the middle of a dash.\n\nyou can aim your main weapon to pretty much any angle you need, but it's tied to your movement and is held ONLY when firing, not a great setup when trying to setup a shot.\n\nwhile another minor point, I feel it's still worth mentioning that if you get too close to an enemy, the game defaults to a melee attack against said enemy, which is fine until you're trying to prioritize something further away.  Given the style of play feels like it'd be better just not being there.\n\nJumpjets in a game are always welcome to see.  Again though, makes no sense if I can't dash and feather them for an extended glide at a good speed!\n\nAs someone who enjoyed the original Cybernator game back in the days of the SNES, I cannot recommend it to others as it just feels like the game was gutted of some of the more critical controls that made that game so fun to play. If you came  here with it's description stating that it evokes the older games like Cybernator and Metal Warriors, you are better off not getting this game. It's definitely cheap and not a big loss if you don't enjoy it.\n","August 12, 2014","false","0.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

If you're intrigued by the screen shots and video, you'll probably like this game. There are some odd quirks here and there, like how your gun will only aim in the direction you're moving or the limited selection of weapons, but none of these things really destroys the gameplay. There is a story told in text, but there's no reason to pay it any mind.\nMy only issue with this game stems from how much it feels like a barebones port of something from an arcade cabnet. When the game starts, you're asked whether you want to play in fullscreen; that's the entirety of your graphics and display options. The fullscreen appears to be 4x3.\nAdditionally, there is no level select or saving, only a set number of continues. Granted, six levels isn't quite enough for either (the only reason I'm recommending this game instead of not), but I'm starting to get annoyed with the number of games on Steam that do the whole "hardcore 4 life, better not need to leave or do other things for a while derp" bs while not saying a single thing about it on the store page. Metal Slug allows level select, and Broforce has saving. Is it really so hard?","May 5, 2014","true","0.7"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hotbullet8/recommended/278930/","hotbullet8","Hot Bullet 8","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hotbullet8/","320 products in account","4/5 Great game !\n\nOVERALL First of all I must say this game was meant to be played with a gamepad, it might be just me but it feels so much organic than on keyboard (mouse is not supported). It’s a hard game, but if you chose the casual route (playing on easy) it has a decent amount of difficulty and you may finish the games 6 levels in about 3h, even on easy you might die quite frequently and need to restart, and I had a lot of fun. All in all if you like mechs and action 2d scrollers you will like this game, I think that $6 are fair but you can get it for $3 on sale if you are hesitant.\n\nREPLAYABILITY As I said, if you are a fan of action 2D scrollers then you will be replaying this game a lot, either you will die a lot and need to replay the game while getting better or you will ace it and will keep augmenting the difficulty setting. This is why I think this game is above average, it has that old school ruthlessness that Japanese developers love to keep alive, if you are a challenge lover then you’ll be right at home at Normal (or harder), but if you like to actually make some progress through the many mini bosses and bosses without seeing your mech exploding countless times then Easy is the place to be, and I feel no shame in that since it is "old school kind of easy”… god bless Japanese quality standards.\n\nGAMEPLAY You’re the pilot of a mech, you chose between 3 main weapons and 3 special weapons according your play style and you only have 3 lives, good luck! 333… either Half Life 3 is confirmed or this game is half satanic *ba dum psss*. Either way the gameplay is pretty straight forward, you will meet a mini boss and a main boss during each level, on harder difficulties the final stage will present you a different boss; also I have to note that your score also depends on how much shields, HP and time you have left at the end of each level, there are no recharging shield on this game so even if you block enemy fire your shield might break once depleted. Even on Easy it was a pain in the ♥♥♥ being able to finish the first level without a single scratch, that’s an achievement that took me around 20min to get… after that I started my Normal run and got to half of the game, I was happy enough with that and decided to move on to another game.\n\nAESTHETIC This game looks a SNES game or a 90s arcade, I find that pretty nostalgic and cool, you even have to destroy some kind of chests to get small powerups such as health, shields and more time. What you see in the screenshots is what you get.\n\nSTORY Actually I didn’t care about this and most of you won’t either. Here’s a mech, go shoot everything in sight!\n\nMUSIC The score on this game is pretty good, again a nostalgic reminiscent of 90s sci fi games, I liked it a lot and immersed me pretty well.","August 19, 2014","true","3.4"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

On the first two levels I could over look it, but on the third level I was upset at the lack of quality control and on the fourth I outright ignored the story after the first paragraph. Its a game about jumpin' n' shootin' with nine different various weapon system combos (main::special) but when you put forth the effort of putting a story line that blends the American Army with Marines (yes, another major flaw) verbiage that conflicts what kind of branch the game's antagonist is supposed to be. It's also confusing to understand if the story line's main character is an Infantryman, Mechanic or Mech Pilot. Seriously between the first three chapters of reading I didn't know what specific job this particular individual is supposed to do. The boosting ability is clunky. While the weapon system seems slow and purposeful, its supposed too (please see Major perks). But when the boost system locks up and you have to wait for an in-game cool down due to a controlling issue (i.e. you can't perpetually double click), it makes the game feel more chuggy and less fluid and fast.\n\nMajor Perks: Its got that Mech-Warrior, Metal Slug, Mobile Suit Gundam, generic shoot'em up feel that many of those have come to enjoy. While moving as fast as you possibly can, you can do combat rushing while conserving your special weapon to take down the sub-boss(es) and main boss. It's fantastic and feel great to destroy the robots and other generic enemies. The sprites and general visual of the game is fantastic and have a split between retro and modern feel that gives the game that charming feel. You got to think on your toes so when you find a mine on the ground (or ceiling) you got to purposely learn how to control your mech while maintaining a certain level of comfortable speed. What got me really sold on the game after I downloaded it was the intro little animation of a mech gliding between the visual cone of another presumed mech firing rounds at the completely viewable mech. It's darn near straight port from one of my favorite SNES game series, the Mech-Warrior franchise. I greatly appreciated the sub-bosses past level 3 because they would (if you don't kill them fast enough) would fire miniature little rocket guided missiles that would hover around you and fire lasers at you. That’s a straight easter egg/nod/etc to Char Aznable's Sazabi!\n\nSo while I still don't recommend it, I do enjoy it. I have a good healthy challenge from gaining achievements, I like the visuals and sounds, the speed feels great when you over look the lack of continuous forward jet propulsion (you loss jet energy when you're hovering but don't lose it when you're gliding on the ground so why keep yourself from gliding continuously like the  MS-09 DOM in MS0079 anime) and fantastic inspiration pulled from all sorts of games/animes.","October 3, 2014","false","5.2"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

Has more in common with nintendo's contra then it has with Cybernator or Gun Hazard.\n-This will not pique your nostalgia.\n\nOn the plus side: It does have really neat graphics, and goes in directions those other games could not. For that the work is to be commended, unfortunately, the designers seemed to have lacked the vision the programmers of those old 16 bit games had.

I feel it was a step back mechanically from SNES.   Mainly the button mapping.  It's great that you want a retro feel and you allow button mapping, but we've had 6 button controllers since the 90's.....you don't need to bind melee with shoot.  I would also like to have a seperate hold button for my fire arc rather than holding down my shoot button to do that, forcing me to time my jumps and movements with my gun's rate of fire.   This makes me feel like I have less control of my mech.\nMovement of this game is very slow.   You are walking everywhere.  Yes, Mechs are slow, but every game usually adds something to help out.  I am not always boosting up, can't I boost forward in the air (like the SNES)?  Or something like the 'skates' from Heavy gear?  I have 8 more buttons on the 360 pad.  That won't happen, though, because the levels are very small and faster movement would reveal that.\nThese problems could actually be ignored if the story were less boring.   But it's a Japanese game, and that's clear with the timer.....It's all about the score.\n\nOverall, it's good.  $6 is a fair price.  It was worth skipping a Starbucks coffee.\n\n+ It hits the retro feel without being cheesy about it.\n+ Good character design.\n+ decent weapon variety (6)\n+ Score based for an arcade feel.\n\n- Sloooooow movement (not sluggish)\n- Music is alright, but nothing that I will be whistling on my way to work.\n- 6 actions tied to 4 buttons.\n- One mech, no customizing\n- Single Player\n\nIf you are looking at this game and haven't played Metal Warriors, I also suggest finding a copy of that.","January 1, 2015","true","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Thing is Cybernator is better but it was an awesome game just the same from that 16 bit era and Gigantic Army isn't bad in itself either. Tell the truth I wouldn't mind seeing Cybernator be one of those Retro games that gets remade but because that's not happening, Gigantic Army is the next best thing. This game does not aim for over the top but insteads focuses on what it does well. There's no wow factor given what games today can do but there are no eye sores here either. But as you play the game you can tell this game was made by a limited development staff... limited in manpower not imagination and they didn't shoot beyond what was possible for this small group. Smart, they made a very good game that couldn't become great because of their size and instead of trying to shoot for the top and making a bomb shell crap game everyone could rip apart, you get this gem that doesn't try to be great but plays nice instead. Could this game be better? Yea. Is there anything wrong with this game? No. The rest on weither you like it or no is tastes and not because the developers pushed out a piece of crap. As far as recommending this game? Yea, it didn't blow my doors off but I didn't turn around and lock the door because it was bad either. There's fun here and for this game's price, it's cheap too.","July 21, 2015","true","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

At it's core, it's a 16 bit inspired shoot em up that looks decent, plays decent, and does everything well enough that I enjoy playing it.  But the real issues are more technical than anything:\n\nThe game either runs as an incredibly small window, or an oversized full screen that cuts off portions of the screen (running on a 1080p display).  There aren't any options to change this, so you're either missing parts of the game or squinting to see everything well enough.  The controls work well enough, though firing seems to be locked at weirdly specific angles, rather than allowing any direction, and you can't adjust it while firing.\n\nThe difficulty is done well, however the one thing that threatens to ruin the game are the insane time limits.  Even with multiple drops to boost it, you'll still wind up dying solely because of the timer.  Combined with the fact that you move incredibly slow and have relatively underpowered weapons, it becomes fairly annoying, specifically during boss fights.  At the very least, a 0 time limited doesn't immediately end the game, but rather strips your health with each second over.\n\nGiven that it's fairly cheap, I can deal with it, as it still has the potential to be fun.","May 5, 2014","true","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's another indie game made with retro style graphics. Surely it's all style with little substance eh? Well.....actually no. This game is the real deal. Heck it doesn't even run in HD! That's right! This game runs in no higher than 480p, so you better pull out your CRT monitor because you're gonna be seeing some scan lines for sure. It's not only 480p, but it's 640X480 which is 4:3 ratio. Yeah, it's hardcore. Checkpoints? Won't find those here. You die, you go back to the beginning of the stage with your weapons dialed back to wimpy. 3 continues.....that's it. Use them all and it's a real "game over". However the developers seem to have mastered the art of making a game challenging, but amazingly fun. Even if you use all your continues and have to start over, you will have fun getting back to the place where you died. This game has more style than most throwbacks and also has killer game play than most throwbacks lack.\n\nI omitted the story at the beginning and in between levels because they're a pretty long read and there is no music to enjoy while reading. I won't lie, I made it about half way through the reading and just started skipping it because it really breaks the flow of the game. The story reading is WAY too long and boring along with having a TON of spelling and grammar errors. It really looks like the story was just thrown in at the last minute. Here is the actual story: You're a mech, and you shoot everything that moves! Gigantic Army is often compared to Cybernator or Metal Warriors on the SNES, but Gigantic Army is much faster pace. So much so that you have a time limit, which you must boost by picking up the time extenders. This was jarring at first as the first few times I played this game I died because I ran out of time. This is not a game where you want to hang around and shoot everything or backtrack like you do in Cybernator. You need to keep moving or you will not have enough time to fight bosses. Honestly once you learn to pick up the pace you won't even notice the time limit, and the fast pace keeps you on your toes. Other than that the game is very satisfying with it's excellent sound design, music, and glorious explosions. The game is very short, but you do unlock more difficulties when you beat the game which does put up a much better challenge than the first time around. This game is not very deep so leave your brain at the door and shoot things.\n\nI love the graphics in this game because they didn't go for the ultra smooth and cartoony look that modern raster graphics provide. Instead they chose the grit that you can only get from 16 bit color pallets and sprites. The game is not overly colorful or elaborate. Much like Shovel Knight, the developers seemed to have gone for a more authentic look from a time where there were actually hardware limitations. Though this game is nothing even close to the production values and excellence of Shovel Knight, it is still good cheap fun. The game normally sells for 6 bucks and goes on sale on every Steam sale for 3 bucks. No matter what price you pay you won't be disappointed.","January 2","true","5.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I just love how everything looks, basically. Even if you just like the whole Heavy Gear-style mech aesthetic with camera heads and wheeled feet and big gunz then this is definitely worth playing.

That's all I have to say, really. It's a great game, and if you liked any of those games, you'll probably like this one. It also has giant robots, and if that isn't a selling point to you, you're a communist.\n\nI do have a handful of problems with it, though. It's blisteringly difficult for a few reasons, but the arcade nature of the game makes me forgive them to some degree. There are also no graphics options, meaning you'll either have to play it full screen, where it's in the wrong aspect ratio and blurrier than someone smearing Vaseline on your screen, or in a very small 640x480 window. I'd say that's pretty inexcusable in friggin' 2016. On the positive side, this also means that the average toaster can run it.\n\nOn the whole, though, despite its flaws, Gigantic Army was a pleasent surprise that's filled with tons of arcadey fun and replayability.
