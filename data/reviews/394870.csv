"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/394870/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2819 products in account","Office Battle is a top down action game, set in an office where you play as one of the many workers who have just been told they are being made redundant. The game was released in December 2015, being developed by Black Lime Studio, who has previously had some not so popular releases on Steam.\n\nThe game play is a very simple idea. You are in control of one worker and your boss has come up with a great idea to let everyone fight for their jobs. You pick up the nearest weapon in the office, don on your keyboard as a shield and of course, reach for the cardboard box in the corner as you step out into the hall ready for battle with your co-workers. You are rewarded with experience and gold for taking down your foes, as well as completing the stage. There are a couple of different stage modes you can take part in, these are a last man standing mode, a domination mode, and a survival mode.  The game’s talent spending system is really easy to get your head around too, only two talent trees to learn, meaning you can pick and choose which ability to aid you in your current situation. The in game shop is where you will spend a lot of your time, as you try and buy the most recent new weapon or piece of armour to take into fight.\n\nVisually, Office Battle is again, very simple. No mind blowingly good graphics here, just your generic looking cartoony style game. It does look better than your standard game though, with it on part with I would say a few Sims games. The office furniture is well modelled as well as quite a few unique character models throughout.  The animation is where this game is let down slightly; the game’s hitboxes are a little bit off making positioning a little difficult at times. The UI in game is clean and easy to understand too.  A really cool addition to this game, is the sound track, some very high tempo upbeat club mix soundtrack is in the background as you run around the halls of the office. Whilst it doesn’t quite make sense totally, it does fit the game play really well as it keeps you on your toes without you realizing it.\n\nThe usual levels offer no real difficulty to get through, where Office Battle really shows some challenge, is on the bosses. The first boss is a real challenge and forced me to replay the last level probably about 10 times in order for me to grind up enough levels and gold in order to just overpower him. A mistake I made was making my character too defensibly minded; I think it would have proved a better move to go offensive right from the start with the talent points. Whilst I am not a huge fan of a game forcing you to replay previously completed content, I don’t feel so bad doing it here; I think it’s because the stages last no longer than 2 and a half minutes usually and the rewards are often worth the time it takes anyway.\n\nThere is a substantial amount of content on offer in Office Battle; I have been playing for almost two hours now and I am only about 1/3 of the way through the main game. There is a free roam style mode but this offers no real benefit other than “just for fun” as you don’t get any experience or rewards out of it. Whether there is much replay ability, remains to be seen. If things carry on the way they are so far, I don’t see there being any reason to play through this game more than once unfortunately.\n\nTechnically, there are a few issues here and there. Firstly the game will run at 1080p as a maximum. Whilst that is the PC standard at the moment, a 1440p or 4k option would of even better especially since they are becoming more popular formats.  Secondly, the game claims to have partial controller support, sadly neither my Xbox nor Steam controller worked at all. The keyboard controls are really weird too; you control your character with the directional arrow keys and you punch/kick with WASD. Personally this is completely wrong, it would be much better to control the character with WASD and attack with the mouse. It makes navigating the character very tricky at times and I got stuck behind office furniture more times than I would like to admit due to the controller problems.\n\nDespite the technical gripes I had with the game, I can’t really complain too much since it is priced ridiculously low at only 79p. If you want an evening’s worth of fun for less than a pound, then Office Battle will certainly do that.  Apart from fixing the controls, the only thing that stops this game being a hidden gem, is some form of local multiplayer option.\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Not Recommended\n3) Only recommended when on sale\n4) Recommended\n5) Highly recommended\n6) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs up.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/deadstanley/recommended/394870/","deadstanley","DeadStanley","http://steamcommunity.com/id/deadstanley/","142 products in account",""Office Battle" is a single-player free-for-all melee where you have to defeat all of your co-workers in order to stay employed during a round of layoffs. The ringleader of the contest is your boss, "Big B." If you win the contest, you essential survive the layoffs and become the next "Big B."\n\nThe idea is the same in each stage -- beat up your co-workers and be the last one standing. There is a small variety of game modes available to you to get this done, such as surviving for a fixed time period, holding enemies off from your office, or just knocking out everyone in the building. Every 10 stages you'll enter a boss fight against "Big B" and there are 60 stages in total.\n\nThe big problem I had with the game was that it's so repetitive that there's really no point in having 60 stages. If you complete the first 10 stages you've seen all that the game has to offer. Doing the next 50 is just a mindless grind, and requires you to gain plenty of experience levels and unlock/buy advanced weapons and armor. If you're the type of gamer who thrives on completing all achievements, then this is going to be a long and boring adventure.\n\nOn its surface the game appears to lack the need for strategy. While in the first 9 stages you can get by with spamming your action buttons repeatedly, you will soon quickly discover that in stage 10 "Big B" will thrash your ♥♥♥. So, in order to be successful moving forward you'll need to actually develop some strategies.\n\nIn terms of customization, there is very little. You can change your avatar's appearance, but I was unable to find any way to actually represent myself. Disappointingly, you aren't allowed to change the appearance of Big B either. Aside from that there's a level editor, but I didn't care for it. I don't think you can even share your creations.\n\nAt a really low price point, the game is worth playing. I picked it up for $1, but I couldn't really recommend it at anything more than $2.","January 21","true","11.5"," 24 of 33 people (73%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","73","24","33","6","0"

And what do you do? Pick up the nearest blunt weapon (yesterday's newspaper maybe), put a cardboard box on your head, and let's go beat everybody!\n\nOffice Battle offers, for less than a single euro, an ultimate experience of how to get bored in few minutes by doing something repeatedly that doesn't give you any motivation to progress further. There are few modes, passive skill trees, inventory system but... all you'll be doing is mashing the punch, uppercut and kick keys until everybody in the office lies down on the floor. Honestly, I don't get it how it gets so many positive reviews.\n\nThere's nothing else for you there, you can just try to get the best scores for the leaderboards - if you are the "score guy", you might like to lose your mind for a few minutes in Office Battle regularly. For others, it's not worth the low price - you might ignore a lost euro, but you won't get the spent minutes back.\n\nIt surprises me that Office Battle is made exclusively for PC players, I'd expect getting similar game more popular on mobile platforms like Android and iOS.\n\n\nFor more reviews, join Samurai Vader's Point of View group and follow my curator page, I'm always happy to see feedback about my reviews.","February 27","false","4.3"," 33 of 50 people (66%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","66","33","50","2","3"

It is the urban dream and this game tries to capture such a wonderful fantasy....\n\nThere are various modes in this game which generally consist of the generic capture the safe points, survive for XYZ amount of seconds and kill XYZ amount of enemies. Not that original if you ask me.\n\nThe weapons and armour are original to this game (cardoard box helmet YES PLEASE) although there is a small selection with the majority of them being unlocked later in the game. The more enemies you kill, the more experience to new levels you gain, and the more money you pick up.\n\nHOWEVER  - - - This game is boring as sin. It is interesting for the first few minutes until you realise everything is the same. The same enemies the same weapons the same layout. Some games benefit from repetition like Diablo or Minecraft. This game really really doesnt. There are limited rewards for your hard work, and most of the better content is locked behind several hours of mundane play.\n\nBuy it on sale, but its a dissapointing game for such a good premise.","May 5","false","1.9"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","10","13","0","2"

It has the same addictive quality you find in Clicker Hero’s and Timberman. This time the game unfolds as an office beat em' up! Last Man/Woman standing gets to keep their jobs! You’ll use trashcans for helmets, rulers for swords and the list goes on! Maps and overall game is pretty simple but the combat and diversity of objectives keep me coming back for more.\n\nThere are over 60 challenging levels with several different modes including last man standing, survival, bosses and more! Each level alternates missions so things stay fresh and exciting; this is a totally achievable 100% at around 15 hours? It requires A LOT of level farming/grinding but totally doable; I typically watch something on TV in conjunction to playing this with no sound. I won't 100% this, after completing the game I still have hours and hours left. It's fun... but not that fun.\n\nWell worth the $1!

It reminds me a bit of a super-simplified Dead Rising 2, though clearly nowhere near as gleefully gory, even if you buy the Brutal Mode DLC (which I still recommend if you don't want a full-blown "kiddie" game, albeit one with a somewhat blackly humorous and "adult" premise...hell, it's only an extra buck, for a grand total of two bucks, ya cheapskate)!  The controls are simple, you can customise your character with simple cosmetics and skill trees, a few different gameplay modes, etc etc.  It's probably precisely what some of you have been looking for, to perversely fill the lunch-breaks at your own dead-end office jobs which you justifiably hate oh-so-much.\n\nIn a Steam-y world chock-full of incompetent "devs" asking perfectly good money for crappy and/or chronically incomplete games, I find it hard to imagine anyone will have much to complain about with this one, though there's always bound to be a few (and just watch the feathers fly over the one dollar DLC...gamers are nothing if not ungrateful ♥♥♥♥ing turds positively OOZING first world problems, let's be honest here)!  It's all good clean and/or bloody fun, not personally my cup of tea to any great degree - hell, I didn't even care that much for Arkham Asylum, so beat-'em-ups clearly ain't my thang - but for some of you out there, you'll probably get endless hours of highly repetitive joy for the low, low price of two bucks or less.\n\nSo stop whinging already, and just buy it if it looks like your bag.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Borador/recommended/394870/","Borador","Borador","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Borador/","374 products in account","Introduction\nOffice Battle is an Indie Beat ‘em up, in which the goal is to defeat all coworkers in order to keep your Job.\nThe player can kick and punch with both arms and also use weapons and armor to achieve this goal. Unfortunately these are the only attack options which are presented. There are two kinds of items which can be found: protective items like shields and helmets and melee weapons. All of them are frequently dropped by enemies or can alternatively be bought at the store between levels using in-game currency. Although there is a large amount of different items, they are all functionally the same and only differ in the amount in which they boost the offensive or defensive stat. Additionally the skill tree also only offers passive power ups, the result of which is, that the the first level and all of the following are mechanically the same with only a minor sense of progression.\n\nAdditionally to the main campaign there is a level editor mode which is usable to create an office using all assets, which are in-game. Walls and floors have to be arranged around a grid, while items such as chairs, tables or decorations can be placed completely freely.\nWhile there is a way to play in the created levels there is no way to share them online and playing them is ultimately inconsequently since no experience or items can be earned while fighting in them.\n\nThere are five game modes: Survival, Office Capture, Last Man Standing and Big B as well as Empty Office. The last of which never appears during the main campaign and only exists to showcase own created levels.\nSurvival, Office Capture and Last Man Standing are all pretty straightforward in that the player has to fight several waves of enemies which spawn indefinitely until the matching conditions are met, which are passing of time limit, visiting certain points in the level for a certain amount of time and defeating a certain amount of enemies respectively. The last mode, Big B, is a Boss Mode, where one enemy is replaced by a slower, albeit much stronger foe. While this seems like a decent amount of variety at first the game modes are all pretty similar, since all of them involve defeating enemies in the same way and only one of the game modes actually differs depending on the layout of the level.\n\nAs mentioned previously,  there is little variety in the gameplay. While there are critical hits and it is possible to stun enemies when attacking with precise timing, there is little strategy involved, since there is no real way to start combos and all the attacks seem to be equally fast and powerful.\nThere is also no multiplayer mode, with the only online feature being a global leaderboard.\n\nAnother problem involving the gameplay is the frequency in which the player can get stuck on walls. While this isn’t a problem most of the time, it becomes one upon entering a doorway, which are sprinkled through the level design moderately common. This is especially hard if there is an assault of several enemies at the same time, so these make for effective traps and have to be watched out for.\n\nThe graphics are colorful and fitting, but nothing spectacular. They do the job, while not being too straining on the computer, assuring smooth gameplay.\nThe sound effects and music are fitting, but nothing unique or out of the ordinary.\n\nPros\n+ Easy to learn gameplay\n+ Good customization\n+ Global leaderboard\n\nCons\n- Repetitive\n- Easy to get stuck on walls\n- Limited online features\n- Minor grammatical errors in item and skill descriptions\n\nConclusion\nWhile the game can become repetitive after a while, due to lack of variety it still achieves to be what it aspires: A fun little brawler in an unusual setting. Which can be played from time to time. While not doing anything anything other than the minimum it is build competently and can provide at least some enjoyment for only a small asking price.\n\nRating: 6/10\n\nThis review was submitted for Elite Giveaways, check us out for more reviews ranging from Indie games to AAA games to F2P games.","February 21","true","7.9"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","6","9","0","1"

For a dollar we have a fun little game that we can play sometimes.\n\nThis is a beat'em up with a pretty good controlls, good music and nice graphics for a Unity game. What's weak is the fact that the game gets repetitive fast. Boss levels are insane - your character is low-levelled when you get around to level 10 boss. You get beaten fast and need to repeat previous levels in order to level up your character. That's tedious.\n\nPros:\n- really nice music\n- decent graphics\n- we get a decent amount of fun for a dollar\n- really original items - weapons, shields and helmets made from everyday use items\n- we have a levelling system in this game\n- controlls are good, especially on a gamepad\n\nCons:\n- gets repetitive in about half an hour\n- levelling pace is somewhat mediocre at first and gets slower with each level\n- items break really fast, boosting skills responsible for item durability helps little\n- boss levels are absurdly hard\n- no point in playing this game for too long - there is not really much to unlock\n- high end items are not really that powerful\n- items cost much, you gain little coins with every level\n\nFew words about DLC - I bought this Brutal Mode DLC and that was a waste of 0,45E. It adds blood effects and some SFX like big smoke explosion when you score a critical hit. This should be included as an option into the base game, not as a DLC.

You cannot defend enemy attacks. You cannot dodge enemy attacks. You cannot counter enemy attacks.\n\nGame dynamic: Stand still or go to a given spot ( the directional doesnt really matter as you will get hit anyway and cannot interact with the enviroment ),  smash the buttons to attack as the enemies runs towards you.  Pick a fewl coins from dead enemies and when you eventually die ( and you will! ) you can shop for weapons or items and start all over again.\n\nWhile there are different " missions " , they are all loose with no game story at all and the dynamic is the same ( in one of them you need to defend a spot , in another you need to beat you boss , but gameplay never changes )\n\nToo bad as with a few adjustments this game could have been awesome. The basic elements are there - controls respond well, decent graphics , rich enviroment ( I still cannot believe there is ZERO interaction with the enviroment - no hidding , no pushing furniture onto your enemies, no picking up stuff from the desks, etc... )\n\nI recommend avoiding this even at an extremely low price. And I cant help but wonder how this game got so many good reviews.","April 8","false","3.4"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Zerocera/recommended/394870/","Zerocera","Zerocera","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Zerocera/","220 products in account","Office Battle is a humouristic game in which you can abreact on virtual colleagues after a hard working day.\n\nIn Office Battle many workers will soon lose their jobs, because a layoff is happening. Your boss, named "Big B" (what's in a name?) organizes a (fighting) competition in which the winners get to keep their jobs. From time to time, the boss will test the worthy champion himself.\n\nThe controls of the game are simple: the player uses the arrow keys to move in all directions, while using the q, w and e keys to perform different fight moves. By leveling up, and gathering skill points, the player can upgrade different skills. Think of getting more health points, getting better at fighting or having a higher coin drop rate of beaten workers. Besides getting stronger because of using skillpoints the player can also (temporarily) make use of different items. These items are divided into three categories: hand weapons, shields and helmets. Hand weapons vary from a newspaper to a lamp or globe, shield vary from a bottle shield to a skateboard and helmets vary from a box to a plant pot. Weapons all have different stats, depending on which weapon it is. New weapons are unlocked at different character levels and can be bought in the store.\n\nThe game has more than 50 levels in its campaign. Every 10th level, the player gets to fight "Big B", which is a very powerful boss. For many, it will be hard to beat this boss, being forced to replay levels on and on, leveling up to gain skill points and to collect new weapons, in order to beat him.\n\nIn conclusion, I give Office Battle a 7/10, for it's humour, simple controls but tough gameplay (in boss battles, which is a real challenge) and wide variety of items and levels. Furthermore, the game has Steam achievements, which is an extra challenge for some players and card drops.","February 4","true","5.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It's a casual game through and through. There are three action buttons (left/right hook and kick) and the gameplay consists of finding a defensible bottleneck, turning to face incoming enemies and literally mashing those three buttons as quickly as possible. That's it. There are no special moves derived from special inputs. There are just under 60 levels of this and every tenth is a boss. All of it is extremely repetitive - the offices, the boss, everything.\n\nSo why the thumbs up? Because I enjoyed it quite a lot for some reason. No, I don't entirely understand why, but I had fun. The production values deserve mention as they are definitely above average for a title of this sort. Visuals, audio (all aspects: music, SFX, voice acting), interface/menus, performance... All of it is polished to a surprising degree, considering how shallow the game itself is. It's a stupid game, but pleasantly stupid.","March 31","true","18.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I've actually paid far more for action games with a similar concept that have far less than what this title offers. It's up there with games I can throw on, turn my brain off to, and just senselessly beat the ever-lovin' ♥♥♥♥ out of coworkers in with my favorite death metal album blaring in the background through an alternate player (though the game's score is pretty catchy as well). Essentially it's a beat 'em up with RPG elements and additional game modes in the campaign that keep the gameplay fresh.\n\nThe Brutal Mode DLC, however? Meh. Doesn't seem to offer anything more than random blood stains on the ground.

Fight to hold your place in the office. I'd say this is a top down puncher/brawler. As you kill your office mates, you can level up. Every level allows you to put points in different skills. You can collect and equip power ups like rulers for smaking people, and keyboards to use as a shield.\n\nThere are three 2 types of game when you play the campaign, hold the office and survival. Hold the office involves standing in a particular spot long enough to capture the area. Survival is self explanatory.\n\nControls are very good. After a while the combat becomes a bit bland.

This is Gamer Guy (In a Suit) from the Echo Army YouTube channel! Today I am bringing you a review of the Indie Action game Office Battle. Office Battle was brought to us on Steam on December 2, 2015 by Publisher/Developer Black Lime Studios.\n\n(NOTE: This game was reviewed using a key from my own Steam library and was NOT provided by the Developer/Publisher)\n\nVideo Review:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/YrhjJk5uVag\n\nThe "Too Long, Didn't Watch" Review:\n\nFor a buck, you can do worse. Good way to blow off steam. Controls can be wonky, though.\n2.5/5 cause it's a buck.\n\nThe "Meat & Potatoes" Review:\n\nWell, this is one of the better kinds of things you can find on Steam for a buck these days. That's for sure. Let's give you some pluses to look forward to. First off, this is a fun way to blow off some steam. Just go into an office and pound some co-workers. Add in the "Brutal" DLC (also a buck) and the extra-gory blood really can be a good release. You meander through the levels and meet the goal to move on. Usually the goal is something like "Survive the wave of Co-workers", etc. It's a Unity game. The graphics are decent as is the sound. The controls actually hold this one back a touch, as they get a little wonky at times. I had to mark it down .5 for that. It did not play any better with a controller, although if you take your time to re-map the entire control setup, it does get better. Honestly, for a buck, it is worth it and can be a fun way to let loose after a trying day. There are definitely MUCH worse games on Steam right now. This one, while just slightly above average right now, is a fun concept and is absolutely worth your dollar (or two if you go "Brutal") 2.5/5. Not too shabby.\n\nHappy Gaming!!!\n","December 9, 2015","true","1.0"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","5","12","0","0"

I was wrong. It uses the arrow keys (which I wasn't upset about) and Q, W, and E. I was upset, because I went into the game and I had no idea what I was doing.\n\nGraphics\nThe graphics are REALLY bad. Lemme show you a screenshow of what you are greeted with when you enter the game. http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=567302128 Yeah. It's bad.\n\nItems\nThey are all the same.\n\nTL;DR Version.\nIt's a bad game and not worth the 1 dollar out of your pocket.","December 2, 2015","false","0.1"," 16 of 54 people (30%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","30","16","54","5","9"
