As always, Her Interactive does a great job of creating an interesting mystery for you to solve, while weaving in several fun subplots and exploring the culture and atmosphere of an American harbor town. I would recommend this game to anyone who likes the other Nancy Drew games or who likes mystery point-and-click adventures.","April 27, 2014","true","9.3"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

The adventure revolves around an island and it's locales, an old harbortown bar, two skippers for whalewatching, an old lighthouse and... smuggling of course.\n\nThe story is, of course quite a normal Nancy Drew fare, besides that you might as well fail, there is always a second chance.  This game has also, as most Nancy Drew Games an infotainment value.\n\nDon't get me wrong, the game isn't bad, neither it's boring or too obvious, you can play this game with some fun, solving riddles, or geting clues. But somehow this game feels... different than some other episodes. I would say, it's mostly the suspense.\n\nPros:Graphics fit the game.Some characters are quite quirky - which is the only fun you'll gain out of the game.Cons:Lacking the suspense of other episodes.Sound, well... the music get's now a bit to repetetive.\nRecommended only to fans of the Series\nThis game is only a must have if you actually like to play the Nancy Drew games. It's not an outstanding game in the series, but it's neiter the total lemon. The only good is some of the quirky characters in the Game, for example Nancy's host, the bar tender, the sailor and... well... of course the other skipper that also has the museum.\n\nDon't grow too affectionate :Tools:","November 18, 2015","true","9.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

This was the first Nancy Drew game I ever played. My parents got this for me when I was a kid and I never finished it until now because the disk no longer runs on my computer.\n\nI enojyed the story and enjoyed the puzzles, although some of them required a bit of back and forth. I would recommend this game, despite its lack of replayability.","August 11, 2014","true","5.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","3"

I enjoyed the characters and usually I get bored of characters because I become disinterested and bored of them. The puzzles were chalenging but they  weren't insane challenging or anything. I also enjoyed the mini games as well. So do I recommend tis game? Absolutely.","January 13, 2015","true","38.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I feel as though these games are not recognized well enough in the gaming community. This title does not deliver, in terms of fear, as much as some of the other entries, however, I still am tense and on the edge of my seat through out. The ending delivers just like every Nancy Drew game does. I strongly recommend this game.","May 7, 2015","true","5.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
