Team Death Match, Capture the Flag, and King of the Hill, with a few variations of these.\n\nEveryone plays a bot, and there are a few to choose from. Each with their own little stats and weapons, although sadly customisation is very very minimal. You can select some active skills ( 2 ), and 4 passives. That's it.\n\nI would have liked if you could actually customise your bot's look and weapons more as it seems rather funky that the smallest one with smallest looking weapons is actually the heaviest with the largest rocket launchers around.\n\nThe game is entirely meant to be played online, which could be very very problematic as so few people are online. Then again the game is only Just out, so it might pick up online.\nIt would have been better if there was even a small little single player campaign, even if only for the tutorial; which at the moment is just text and some animations of bots and a generator.\nIt's not bad, and it gets the point across but I feel it could do with more there.\n\nIn regards to single player, at the moment all it is, is the online matches played against bots. Similar to games of old, if there aren't enough people online the teams get filled with Bots. Their A.I can be lacking at times, and I've seen my team flag runner often getting stuck on another friendly bot.\n\nGameplay wise it's rather fun, and I do like the music. It's not hard to pick up at all and that's partially due to familiar game modes, controls and limited customisation. You simply quickly select your perks and get in there blasting.\nAt any time during the match you can simply press T, which brings up the original Bot menu. Here you can select a new bot or change your actives and passives.\n\nThat's it really. It's kinda fun, but nothing stellar. Although like most online focused games will be substantially improved when playing with and against friends over Voice Comms.\n\nPC Gameplay\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXNmlrudZSQ","August 4, 2015","true","2.2"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","16","19","0","2"

There isn't much, but there is some.\n\nTournement Mode: It does not tell you how many games are in a tourny. I have been trying very hard to aquire the "Win a Tournement" achivement. I do not know if the mode is glitched or if there are more matches to be played, for there is no idicator of how many more matches are to come. On that note, if the tourny mode is not glithched and I have just not completed all the games, there are way to many matches (in my opinion) before the winner is selected.\n\nGlitches: I have not noticed any visual glitches in the game so far, but there are a few audio glitches that are quite noticable. During sequences with tons of audio clips going at the same time, there could be an absense of noise all together. This is most noticable when a bot overloads and goes into "Fire Rate Broken" (i do not remember the exact name) and all audio goes silent for a second or two. There are also a few instences that i saw AI robots stuck in a corners being brutally shot and destroyed.\n\nAI: the AI in this game is very easy to beat after you get a slight hang of the controls and mechanics. I have never come in lower then first places in a match with just AI robots. This makes it easy to achive very high scores on the leaderboards which will hopefully be reset after the full release of the title. If anything i would request that Bunnycopter create different levels of AI difficulty.\n\nTurret Secondary Ability: When you place a turret, it can become stuck on it for a second or so after placing it. It becomes farily annoying sometimes but is a minor problem.\n\nOh also gimme more maps plzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz. Game needs a little more map diversity.\n\nThe negetives might sounds like a lot, but don't let any of them deter you from aquiring this title. I have simply listed, in detail, the areas Bunnycopter could implove on. These minor areas effect little of the game's amazing gameplay.\n\nBroken Bots is a top down, team based online/offline shooter. You play as a broken bot, armed with cannons or flamethrowers (including different variations). There are a few different (but all fairly classic) gamemodes such as Deathmatch, Capture the Flag, King of the Hill, Crazy King (King of the Hill but with a moving "hill"), and a tournement mode. This is a limited amount of gamemodes, but is acceptable for an Early Access game.\n\nThe twist that this game pesents to this genre of video games is the "broken" aspect of the bots. These bots, after taking enough damage, will malfunction, inverting your aim, breaking the bot's movement speed or fire rate, ect.. These, as shown, can be positive or negitive effects (more likely to be negetive). This adds an exciting new aspect to the traditional kill everything idea. You could have grabbed the enemy flag and be halfway back to your base when an enemy, out of nowhere, gets that one hit to send you into 100% territory, inverting your driving, and sending your fingers scambling to conpensate for the change, all the while shooting back at your attacker and dodging his attacks. This mechanic puts a new spice into mid-combat, creating a sense of urgency.\n\nOverall Broken Bots is an overload of fun and will be well worth your $6.99.\n\nYou should also get it due to the fact we need more online players in the community","August 22, 2015","true","8.8"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

The bang for your buck is great, priced at the value of 2 beers and the fun you get from it is about a barrel worth. That's a good deal in my book.\nIf you have a LAN-party and are looking for a game to play with everyone, look no further.\nThe soundtrack is pretty cool, but after a couple of games it is best to turn it off to keep your sanity :)\nThe bots are completely customizable skill/perk-wise so everyone will find a botcombo that is his prefered playstyle.\n\nI would rate it 5/7\n","May 11","true","5.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This game gives me those same vibes.  Broken Bots is a top-down shooter in which you must complete objectives to keep your systems running or your bot will malfunction, giving you extra hurdles to overcome while fighting your enemies. Fight your way through the single player campaign or battle it out in Capture The Flag, Team Deathmatch & King Of The Hill. Learn to deal with the unexpected, capitalize on malfunctions that work to your advantage.
