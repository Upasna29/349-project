There are circumstances where you cannnot win, and those circumstances are in the very beginning of the game. The way I can only guess it works is that you drive on a road and stop in towns. Now, I have to assume this because these are completely and utterly impossible to reach. The problem is that you [/i cannot] actually get there without running out of fuel. Doesn't matter if you stock up on a full tank and drive in a straight line (cause I did that, four times to make sure I wasn't making mistakes) because you will still run out.   You can buy a fuel upgrade but there is nowhere near enough money to buy that in the first town.\nYou're ultimately left with the option of dying until RNGesus blesses you with fuel drops from killing cars.\n(Good luck, I only got one out of those four runs. In the process killing 30+.)","January 15","false","0.2"," 132 of 188 people (70%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","70","132","188","20","14"

The thing is it's not old and everything is just out of new designs, new scripting and everything really nice. The game looks really nice as you start it up, nothing really lacking of content pretty much, as you start the story mode you'll see the game actually does have really good looking design. As you start driving your way, you'll also get some humor involved. Also the upgrades capability and the stores themselves, do have a lot of options and a lot of stuff for you to work to get it :) Other than that the trailer, description and other reviews tell you all that's about, Guns Driving and Running :) I also wanna say its that the game looks really promising and does show from the first minutes of gameplay that your next minutes spend playing this game will be worth it. Also it really looks like the developers worked hard, and knowing their past, you'll know this is actually a game they've put work into and this is gonna be like the first stable game they will launch. Hail 16bit Nights!\nAnd btw it is worth it to get this game at 1 Buck, why not get it now while it's at 60 cents? :D ITS WORTH IT TRUST ME!","January 13","true","6.7"," 17 of 25 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","17","25","0","3"

Choose your upgrades carefully, many complain that running out of gas is the big issue, well..they must not have realised that the use of nitro is imperative, if you dont use your nitro profitiently you will run out of gas. The game is still plagued with bugs and A.I. issues, for example I left my vehicle to walk ahead and deal with a few baddies and when I turned back the road, my vehicle, and just about everything dissapeared. Some times baddies get stuck off the screen and you have to assume you are shooting them. Rage quitting is inevitable. I also worry the devs. will abandon this game or not make much a priority out of it considering they are Armenian and most complaints must be translated.

I mostly got it because I felt confident about spending for nearly anything after replenishing my steam wallet and that I really dig this kind of deserty wasteland theme.\n\nIt was alright enough. I haven't played for that long or gotten too far but, from what I've played so far, I'm pretty sure it's good enough for a 99₵ pricetag. It does what it's suppose to do thoroughly and it doesn't hold your hand. You have to really think and be cautious when progressing and to also be aware about all the variables that you have to take care of. I've noticed that most of these other reviewers are saying that they can't get to the 2nd town because "the game's unfair" when they probably didn't upgrade their vehicle (repair vehicle if below 60, fuel up, attach 2nd AK turret, and maybe buy some off-road tires) and keep their distance from enemy cars.\n\nThis game is more complicated than I anticipated and you need to plan out your journey so that you won't be relying only on the RNG. It does not have everything that it should. It should give you the ability to rebind some controls (the controls could take some getting used to), it's sort of luck based, the combat could be better and more built upon, and there's a major lack of toilets here.\n\nIt's alright, especially for it price, it's not garbage, it is challenging (like how old NES games were challenging), and it may be a good distraction in between of doing things or waiting for a bigger game of yours to get patched.\n\nI may have only played around a halfhour but I don't regret this small purchase. Heck, you could probably just get a refund if you don't like it after a few sessions or go for the trading cards and make a profit of the marketplace. I know that I'm gonna keep this one around.","February 13","true","0.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Borador/recommended/428950/","Borador","Borador","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Borador/","373 products in account","Introduction\nKivi, Toilet and shotgun is a classical top-down shooter with 16-bit graphics, in which the goal is simply for the main character Kivi to arrive at the end of the road while defeating enemies and and stopping by villages from time to time in order restock on supplies.\n\nThe game basically features two playstyles, shooting on foot and shooting while driving. The player constantly changes between both of them while traversing the wasteland. On foot Kivi can use multiple weapons in order to defeat foes and visit shops. Upon entering a car the player can also use nitro and run enemies over in addition to shooting at them.\nThe game is essentially split up into driving and on foot levels which freely flow into each other and in which all past upgrades are carried over.\n\nAs the game is split between driving and walking, the enemies are also divided along these lines. There are driving enemies and walking enemies which not only have different attack patterns but also different loot, since supplies are only dropped by vehicles.\nOtherwise supplies can only be purchased in one of three shops which are present in every village. This is a very crucial step as a lack of acquiring fuel ends the game prematurely and a lack of ammunition leaves no way of defending against armoured vehicles.\nThe other two shops provide upgrades to either Kivi or his car. The selection of upgrades is pretty sizeable, but nothing out of the ordinary with additional weapons and upgrades to all other parameters, like fuel or armour.\n\nIn addition to the story mode there is also a Drive Test. This game mode allows the player to choose any of the existing car models in game and upgrading them from the start. By defeating bosses or getting other in-game achievements you can unlock more starting money for this game mode. While it does not offer much it it atleast some additional content, supplementing the base game. It can also crash your game upon access, as this happened to me personally every time I tried to access this mode after playing the main story.\n\nThe visuals are pretty bland with mostly orange, brown and grey hues dominating the wasteland. While this is fitting for the setting, which is very reminiscent of the 80’s classic Mad Max, the transitions between night and day augment this problem. By nighttime most of the screen is barely visible with only a small portion of the screen illuminated by the players flashlight or by the car's headlights. While there is a way to upgrade the nightly visibility on foot, this problem hinders gameplay while driving significantly, since the cones of the car’s headlights are pretty small and there is no way to improve upon them, which results in either deliberately sluggish driving at night or collisions with objects or enemies.\n\nThe music is pretty repetitive with only one track playing throughout the whole game. While it is not bad per se it can get annoying on longer play sessions. There is also an issue with the volume. If it is not set to the maximum setting the game will automatically play the music at that volume after it loops once, which is unfortunate since there is no way to access the option menu without exiting the game and losing some progress.\n\nPros\n+Challenging gameplay\n+Competent shooting mechanics\n+Variety in boss design\n\nCons\n-Repetitive music\n-Can be buggy sometimes\n-Bland visuals\n\nConclusion\nWhile the game has it’s shortcomings it still delivers a challenging gameplay which requires a little bit of strategy and planning to master it. With the low asking price in mind the game can be recommended to play in short sittings.\n\nRating: 6,2/10\n\nThis review was submitted for Elite Giveaways, check us out for more reviews ranging from Indie games to AAA games to F2P games.","February 25","true","3.3"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","1"

The first time you pay this game you will fail, it'll be a learning experience. However, for a £0.79 game what else can you expect? And since it's such a cheap game I am going to recommend this game. It has a nice concept to it with some nice graphics and other things that kinda bring this game up. I feel like it still needs a lot of work on it even though it's a full game.\n\nGame PlayThis game has a few issues with the controls and the way what they tell you the controls. First off the controls that they tell you are WSAD to move your character/car, Q to enter the car and E to use your nitrous when your in your car. You can also shoot while pressing U. Excuse me? So I have to move with WSAD, press U to shoot and move the mouse to aim? Why didn't you just say that the left mouse button is to shoot as well... It kinda fails to tell you the basic controls. That and to enter shops and stuff you have to press Q, which you aren't told. There are then also no way to change the controls which would've been helpful. Sometimes the game can be a little bit too difficult, with the limited life you have with your car and yourself as your character can sometimes feel like there isn't really much balance in the game. Say that you where playing the game for the first time and you drove past the town after defeating all the enemies there and then you just realised that you had money to spend. So possibly you can go back to the town and buy some things? No you can't, the game forces you to keep on driving forward, this shouldn't be. You must be able to go back to where you just came from to buy some stuff. Despite all the bad things I have just said there are a few things that make this game great. There is a nice variety of gadget upgrades for your car, these can help you get better weapons for your car so that you can dispose of the enemies cars more quickly and efficiently. This provides to be very useful as the enemies can kind of gang up on you and destroy your car pretty quickly, this then results in a instant game over. It's a nice game if you're playing it in short sessions and want to kill some time. I felt playing it in long sessions made the game just seem boring and repetitive. So to eliminate this play it in shorter sessions to increase the amount of fun you can get out of this game. There is a real nice way of how this game makes you think about how to spend your money. You could, if you wanted, spend it all on your characters weapons. But then you run out of fuel and then it's a instant game over again. It really makes you think and plan your journey ahead on what you need to prioritise about your car or character, otherwise you won't get very far.\nScore (Out Of 10): 6 - Doesn't tell you everything you need to know for the controls, would like to see a option to change the controls, I don't understand why you made it so you can't drive back on yourself.\n\nGraphics/Art StyleSo to start of, your game loads up in windowed mode which isn't much of a problem as you can change it to full screen in the options menu but would've been nice if you could've started the game in full screen. You also can't change the music setting while in game, I am unsure why they would do this but they did. Make sure that you change the music and sounds volume to your desired volume before playing the game. As for the graphics of this game, I really like the retro kind of feel you get from the game. There isn't much variation when it comes to the colours of the game, and that it's just a constant road the goes forward. A nice little feature about this game is the lighting when it turns to night or day. I really like that transaction between the night and day cycle.\nScore (Out Of 10): 7 - Nice Day/Night lighting effect, but the game needs more variation to it's colours and the environment itself.\n\nMusic & SoundsAs for the music and sound there isn't really that much to talk about. The music that plays in the background just constantly goes on, even when you die and go onto the main menu it's just constantly on. Would've liked some more variation when it comes to the Music. The sounds are pretty basic and generic, but they really missed out on some of the basic sounds such as the car driving, there's no sound of that at all.\nScore (Out Of 10): 4 - Needs more variation for Music, and need more Sounds for car and possibly your character walking and such.\n\nConclusionSo, taking into consideration that this game only costs £0.79, I do still recommend this game to people who like a retro, difficult kind of game. Just don't expect a lot of variety when it comes to music and the sound. Play it shorter sessions to get the most enjoyment out of this game, as this game is really just a time killer.\n\nFor more reviews on a wide range of games, go and follow Lot's O Giveaway's curator group here.","February 14","true","1.9"," 14 of 25 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","14","25","0","1"

When all you know about a game is that it has to do with toilets and guns, there is much to be skeptical about. However, shortly after getting into the game I was pleasantly surprised by a simple, fun concept that provided what I would say was a good value, for a 99 cent game.\n\nSoon after reaching the first checkpoint, I experienced my first death. Restarting was no big deal, since I had made progress and I was okay with having to go back a few steps once a lesson was learned. What I did not expect (or enjoy) was the many, many deaths it took me to reach the next few checkpoints. I rethought my strategy several times, buying many different upgrades and never forgetting to refill on health and supplies. But checkpoints were few and far between, and dying became tedious and very unpleasant.\n\nOnce, after barely cruising into a checkpoint, I dismounted my vehicle, weary and ready for another fight. However, instead of aiming for me, a resudial enemy from the road came in and destroyed my car, leaving me without a vehicle. Not built to handle this phenomenon, the game then had me walk for miles with no vehicle enemy spawns. Once I had reached the end of the road and arrived at the next town, I braced myself for the foot soldier attacks that would come before I could claim my checkpoint. However, they never did come. Since I had never dismounted my vehicle, the game had never been signaled to spawn the enemies for my battle!\n\nUnable to save and stuck with no action, I left to the main menu to try Test Drive mode, which had worked bug-free for me prior to my little dilemma. Upon entering of the Test Drive section, the game promptly crashed (which I suspect had something to do with my previous bug).\n\nThat said, Kivi, Toilet and Shotgun is a great game for the price it's at. It's pretty fun, with a moderate replay value. However, the difficulty slant in this game along with the many bugs I have experienced make this review a downvote.","June 5","false","1.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

(You will barely take a scratch from the first boss, but regular enemies can drain your hp within seconds.) There is a lot of wasted potential and it feels like the devs abandoned it when they were halfway through.\n\nThe items drop randomly, so if you are not really carefully how and when you speed up while driving and keep your distance to enemies, you will have a hard time to survive, because HP-Packs won't drop at all sometimes. Some of the items are not explained, so you have to figure it out on your own, what exactly they do.\n\nThere are a few upgrades that doesn't make sense, since it would make the game harder. Why should i buy a pistol for my car, when it has an automatic rifle by default? You can beat the entire game with the automatic rifles (for the Car and Char). You won't need anything else.\n\nThe balancing for the boss battles would really need some improvements and changes. The second boss is probably the hardest, while every other boss is rather too easy. You can even hit them, when they can't hit you and some of them are stationary.\n\nGraphics are okay for such a simple game and have some fine details.\n\nIt could have a few more sounds. You don't even hear your car while driving.\n\nBut beside all of that you can get fun out of it, when you like games of this kind and if you want a challenge that can be frustrating from time to time. The concept is good, but it has much wasted potential.

On route you will encounter enemy vehicles which can be destroyed with on board weaponry and you shall stop at each village/checkpoint to endure a wave of enemies in order to liberate them so you can purchase your vehicle and personal upgrades there.\n\n\nGameplayThis game is difficult, very difficult, even unbalanced maybe? I'm able to reach the first village without problems but the rest depends on RNGesus and which enemies he spawns. I've had times I barely made it to the next, other times I got killed early on cause I either ran out of fuel or didn't have enough armor to protect my health. In all those scenarios I had around the same amount of cash, just a different upgrade.\n\nYou could say that you need to find which upgrade is best at which checkpoint and dependent on the amount of cash you have. While this is true, I must admit the gameplay is rather repetitive if you die many times. Therefore finding the commitment/motivation to try a next time decreases drastically with each death on the record.\n\n\nPersonal Purchase AdviceI bought the game while on a -40% sale resulting in a price of € 0,59. Even though the full price is € 0,99, which is not that much, my opinion is the following:\n\nIf you're a person who likes a challenge and who won't give up easily then:\nEssential | Recommended | Average | Bad | Avoid\n\nFor all the others:\nEssential | Recommended | Average | Bad | Avoid","January 18","false","2.7"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","1"

There are bugs in the game that sometimes dont even let you pass a level. There is a bug that doesn't let me buy anything from the shop unless i click it ALOT of times. You run out of fuel way too fast. Its just a little tiny bit hard because its pretty easy to die in your car. I guess the game is sorta worth it if you get it on sale because you could probably make more money than you bought the game for by selling the trading cards but the gameplay is bad and pretty boring.","January 17","false","2.0"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","1"

Take your car town to town for kill all bad guy.\nGet in the car, destroy others cars, get in the town, kill all the bad guys, buy gaz/upgrades, get in the car,...\nNo big mistake here.\nYou die few times understanding that "the most important is having gaz" but you always continue thanks to the check point in every town.\nIt's something close to be a decent game.\n\nSo why it's fall short? I can identify 4 things:\n-Repetitive gameplay. (kill and course in straight line. Always have to buy fuel. Who's the guy who put gaz in his car only good for be able to go to next town?)\n-Basic sound.\n-No so good graphic.\n-It's take 2 hours of gameplay to get your first steam card! That make me fell that people who do this game are greed. They impose they own rules and it's not really what the player look for.\n\nIt's basicly what this game make me feel like : good concept, not what the player look for.","January 17","false","2.5"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","1"

I hope they add more music instead of just the one song that seems to play on a loop, but something is better than nothing.\n-The game does have more balance, although the foot enemies in between villages feel really over-powered.\n-I've changed my recommendation to a "Yes" because the developers appear to be actively listening to the feed back, and, after playing it for a little bit longer, I've started to find myself enjoying the frustratingly difficult gameplay. I've wanted to quit playing many times, but getting to that next village just feels so good.\n\nThis is a pretty challenging game, but the negative aspects of the game make very difficult to enjoy.\n-The sound design is extremely basic, with only a few gun shot noises, a delayed car revving, and a constant, headache-inducing wind blowing.\n\n-The gameplay, although challenging, is can be very repetitive. Drive from village to village, while fighting enemies in between. Sometimes face a few waves of enemies at a village, and sometimes face a boss.\n\nWatch the first 15 minutes of game-play here (the gameplay is from a previous version): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZIan0RCjEw","January 16","true","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","4"

Now, if you play the game reasonably well, you should be able to encounter more of the content. This is still a budget game, but far closer to my original expectations.\n\nOriginal Review:\n\nFor $0.50, it fell into my "cheap as free" gaming addiction. However, the game itself is really, really basic. There appears to be fundamental game design issues: after the first town, you fight cars for a while that drop fuel, but eventually enemies stopped spawning (along with the critical fuel they drop).\n\nI tried six times and suffered two crash to desktops and four rounds where the enemies just stopped showing up for work.","January 17","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"
