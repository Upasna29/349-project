Diabolically difficult puzzler. Your little grey cells will be tested to the max from the very beginning of the game. Escaping is not so hard.... but collecting those bonus starfish certainly is. You MUST use both fish as a team to achieve your goals and be ready to think way outside the box here. If you like to be challenged then you will appreciate this game. There is pretty much one solution to any given puzzle and you need to find it to succeed. Thankfully there is a seemingly infinite undo system or you can simply restart when you feel beyond recovery. This is well worth the money as the challenges will baffle you for a worthwhile amount of time.","September 15, 2014","true","1.4"," 28 of 30 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","28","30","0","0"

If you are looking for something to tease your braincells with, look no more.

If you get stuck, you can always go and try solve another room, or you can go back to one of the older ones, and complete it while also collecting up to three stars, which in turn will give you access to other rooms.

Your job is to push different objects around using two fish characters to meet some final objective (usually getting out of a room). The puzzles do get quite challenging and can be frustrating at times. The sheer number of puzzles and special objectives should keep anyone busy for hours on end. It's a great workout for the mind.","August 22, 2012","true","10.2"," 14 of 21 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","14","21","0","0"

It offers a proper logical challenge on a reasonable curve. You quickly get obsessed with solving the rooms and collecting bonus stars that can raise the difficulty incredibly high.\n\nCompared to the original Fish Fillets, the humour got somewhat tuned down, the rooms are more uneventful (no more talking heads and dancing crabs) and the game is generally less silly. However, it is still funny and lively, as there are more active characters and plenty of dialogue. The 3D videos are not of great quality and look like someone needed to check them off a list, but the in-game 3D graphics is surprisingly good-looking and not too distracting.\n\nThe rest is only praise. The game got incredibly improved with completely new and original mechanics. Apart from a big and small fish, you work with crawling crabs, sticky snails, items that float and rise up, deadly lasers and radiation. The authors also cleverly introduced bonus starfish that can be collected for an extra challenge. That way, the puzzles can be impossibly hard for those who want to, but the player does not get stuck in the story progress. Solving the puzzles is also made more efficient with the save and undo system, and you can unlock a square-grid feature that is really helpful. There is a great number of rooms to solve, to many of which you will return to solve them again, but this time collecting starfish on your way out.\n\nThe game does not aim to keep up with the current visual trends and may seem mediocre at first sight. However, it has a very catchy and cleverly designed gameplay. It is one the best logical games I have ever played, and you should definitely give it a try.","November 7, 2015","true","76.1"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

I'm not sure why. It's not for the corny and awkward dialogue, or the forced X-Files tie-in. It's not for annoying banter while you're trying to concentrate on a puzzle (although to be fair, this can usually be turned off). And it's not for the sometimes frustratingly opaque puzzles.\n\nI think it's the completionist in me that keeps playing it. Getting through the levels isn't a terrible challenge, but to get all the starfish as well is incredibly difficult sometimes. But the satisfaction of getting them all is worth it for me, I guess.\n\nIn short, if you like push-the-blocks-around type puzzlers with difficult extra challenges, give this one a try.","June 16, 2015","true","67.2"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

There were so many complicated rules for moving and carrying objects and one wrong move would result in instant death, this might have been mitigated by its generous save system if not for so many levels having a solution that involved doing some unintutive thing right at the beginning, or everything you worked for would be for naught.\n\nThis game FIXES EVERYTHING.  I've never seen such a spectacular upgrade of everything frustrating between titles.  The complicated positioning rules are gone, allowing you to concentrate on solving the puzzles rather than carefully avoiding wrong moves.  Somehow they've managed to make their save system even better, with it constantly autosaving after every slight move you make.  Add to this a host of new characters with fun rules of their own, clever bonus stars to find, English voice acting that let's you solve puzzles while listening to the dialogue (why don't more games let you play while listening to the cut scene).  It's pretty much a perfect (hard) puzzle game.  And the best of this sort I've played after the two Toki Tori games.  The plots are cute too. :-)","October 18, 2015","true","17.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

While the premise of the game is nothing special, it does support both the Steam Overlay and widescreen modes.  The graphics are sub-par compared to other modern puzzle titles, with cinematics in particular looking very blurry and dated.  However, the game is well carried by good voice acting from the fish who constantly banter throughout the gameplay.  The music is also somewhat below average tropical adult contemporary that adds little value to the game.

I thought I was going to get some cheeky little silly game to make fun of while I streamed it to some friends.  Just some subpar kid's game to have some laughs over.\n\nI could not have been more wrong.\n\nBeneath this deceiving layer of paint lies, quite literally, one of the hardest puzzle games I have ever played in my life.  I got completely stumped on the very first real level and I was completely mindblown when I looked up the guide to complete it.  I saw the second level in action and I just quit.  That was too much for me.  These videos included how to get the "starfish" or the little bonus objective in each level, but still I concluded that this was way out of my league of effort and patience.\n\nEverything just requires -pinpoint- precision, and if you make one mistake... well, for starters you don't know where you went wrong, or even IF you went wrong.  But if you did go wrong, you don't know where.  In the end that means you made zero progress and have to start over.\n\nEverything about this game is absolutely confusing.  Even the BONUS UNLOCKABLES ARE PUZZLES, which the first one I tried was a jigsaw puzzle of the main characters, yet the pieces MELTED TOGETHER and you could only SWAP pieces, so you could effectively render solving it impossible if you melted the wrong pieces together because you could only swap pieces and not move them around freely.\n\nBuy at your own risk.

The game has some very 'interesting' mechanics- it incorporates the use of not one, but TWO fish. Each of these 'fish' are extremely similar, yet uniquely different. The fat one can move heavier objects, whilst the thin one cannot. Having two fish is somewhat confusing at times, yet after some experimentation one can always find their way through the challenging levels. The interaction between the fish is inspired and the dialogue well thought out. The story is uniquely driven by emotion and the level design is articulate, it often feels as if each level was designed in a completely different way. The developers have gone to even greater heights than in previous titles, and although the game is difficult to run on most high end machines, it is definitely worth the effort.\nWell worth the $2 my friend spent.\n\n10/10 You will often find yourself being crushed repeatedly by coke cans... And want it to continue.\n\n*Edit* Still being crushed by coke cans.","May 30, 2014","true","0.2"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

The voluptuous voice acting combined with the sheer brilliance of the star developer, Ivo Danihelka, is the most beautiful creation seen before my eyes in my short lived 15 year lifespan.

I am highly anticipating the MMORPG Fish Fillets 3:Revenge of Max flounder Jr. that is currently being developed by the the one true star of this gaming franchise, Kris Bherri.

Where do i even start? The voluptuous voice acting combined with the sheer brilliance of the star developer, Ivo Danihelka, is the most beautiful creation seen before my eyes in my short lived 15 year lifespan. I HIGHLY recommend this game and what better time to get it than in the steam summer sale? I am highly anticipating the MMORPG Fish Fillets 3:Revenge of Max flounder Jr. that is currently being developed by the the one true star of this gaming franchise, Kris Bherri. Unfortunately i cannot make comparisons to other games because that would be like spitting straight on a baby.\n\nBut yeah, the game is bad.","June 24, 2014","false","1.1"," 3 of 27 people (11%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","11","3","27","2","0"
