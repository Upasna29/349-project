Like all the Anno games, it can be a little bit micro-managerial, but it's delightful nonetheless.  A good sound track and lovely graphics are definite good points, and the trade system is one of the best around.  If I had a complaint it would be that the computer players/NPCs natter at you constantly.  That could really be toned down but it's easy to handle by adjusting sound settings, too.  But it's completely possible to just get lost in this game and spend hours upon hours enjoying it.","August 5, 2014","true","4.7"," 36 of 40 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","36","40","2","0"

First even though the game is relatively old (2010) the graphics are still beautiful but even more than that, what truly shines in this game is the attention to detail. Watching your workers roll barrels, or some peasants celebrating at a tavern or even the performers at the juggler's camp is highly entertaining. The gameplay is extremely satisfying with excellent depths however it's simple enough and the campaign does a good job of introducing the gameplay elements. The storyline is meh, but the campaign is still enjoyable with varied scenarios and objectives like all good strategy games. The scenarios will also add decent amount of gameplay hours after the main campaign is clocked and the continous mode will further still add more gameplay hours.\n\nIf you do buy this game and enjoy it then the Venice addon is higly recommended as it essentially add more content is an already excellent game.","November 15, 2015","true","90.1"," 21 of 21 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","21","21","0","0"

The premise of the game is that you need to fulfil the demands of your population. You harvest resources to build houses; you build houses to increase your population and secure taxes; as your population increases, their demands for other resources increase; and as you fulfil those demands, you garner greater taxes and unlock the rest of the tech tree. It's hard for me to recommend this game over Anno 1701, this plays more like an expansion than a sequel (they both use the same engine), but I can assure you you can sink many hours into this game.","January 25, 2011","true",""," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Weaver2/recommended/33210/","Weaver2","Weaver","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Weaver2/","540 products in account","The best way I can describe this game is one part tropico and one part dwarf fortress.  It's a city builder, trade management and hapiness management game.  I love nearly every bit of this game, with the exception of it's moderatley boring combat.\nLuckily, combat is a relatively minor point of the game and, even though not very exciting, still works and is quite easy to grasp.\n\nAnother strong point in this games favour is it's gentle learning curve.  Dawn of Discovery introduces game ideas throughout the well crafted campaign.  It could even be said that the Campaign almost functions as a tutorial for the enormity of the game.\n\nAnd enormity is what you get!  Like in Dwarf Fortress, you don't just make items.  For instance, if you want to supply your nobles with lether jerkins then you first build a farm for the cows, then a skinner, then a tanner, then ship them to the clothes maker, etc.  It is luckily somewhat more simple than DF.

It's difficult to understand why you aren't allowed to build such-and-such a structure.

Couldn't launch it for few weeks, before i found a solution (non latin characters in a game folder path) and shared it with everyone else on forums. Meanwhile ubisoft didn't reply on forums or tickets and introduced a fix TWO month's later. Disgusting.\n\nThe game itself is good enough though - graphics are pretty, music is nice... gameplay however is slow, especially multiplayer since you can't speed it up.\n\nI can't recommend it since Anno 2070 has been out for a year and its basically the same game with different graphics. But it instead if you want classical chain production strategy game.","February 12, 2014","false","11.2"," 18 of 67 people (27%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","27","18","67","2","0"

First played the game on Wii then realized Steam had this game in its library. Love the history and lore behind the game and the diplomacy measures added. Trading with the Orient is fun and trying to avoid the pirates of the sea the Corsairs. Also enjoy the free choices of the continuous mode to build your metropolis to your liking, while taxing your subjects. In the end I am aware that the game was made in 2009, however the graphics for the time are incredible and so far the game has had no noticeable bugs. Points to not having it to connect to the faulty Uplay launcher like Anno 2070.","January 19, 2015","true","7.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The campaing kind of explains a bit, but i quickly started playing the continuous mode, which is insane. Most campaign levels are 4-5hours long, and continuous never stops.
