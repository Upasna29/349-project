I realy enjoyed the humor and art style. Sometimes walking within the game can be a bit tedious. It is also quite a short game currently. Although, the soundtrack almost makes it worth the purchase alone... Well worth it if you get it now for just over 4 US dollars. But the original asking price seems to be a bit steep with the current ammount of features.\n\nTL;DR: worth it if you can buy it on sale.","April 2, 2015","true","1.9"," 28 of 30 people (93%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","93","28","30","2","1"

I have a lot of time for games that actually include voice acting in point and click adventures, as they really make it a better experience, and Bertram Fiddle's dialog is extra special with the witty English humour, puns and plenty of pop-culture references.\n\nStory is well presented. The game starts out with your characters wife (I assume it's his wife) ordering you to get a proper job, but first she sends you on an errand, to get her dog groomed! This is when the plot starts! This is the first part of what I assume to be three or four more games.\n\nControls, these are pretty much a formality. Point and click with your mouse to interact with objects. There is standard inventory system too. I didn’t like how some of the item combinations were really random, and it took me looking up one or two of the answers in order for me to progress\n\nThis episode took me roughly an hour and a half to complete, which is standard it seems for an episodic type game.

However, due to the double entendres throughout the game, I question whether it would be suitable for them either.\n\nAs each chapter progresses, the inventory becomes empty each time, making the puzzles extremely straight forward and linear. If the items were more obscure, It would encourage the user to think a bit more for themselves. It would definitely help one to engage with the story. I like a challenge!\n\nDue to the short length of the game, I didn't feel like I got to 'know' the characters enough to really like or connect with them. Bertram's voice was like nails on a chalk board but I could put up with his whines if the murder investigation had more twists and turns, allowing his 'hoity toity', humourous personality to shine through.\n\nIf the sequel encapsulated more of the above, I would definitely give the franchise another chance because the potential is there for a good game.\n","June 30, 2015","false","2.7"," 22 of 32 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","22","32","0","0"

The art style is what interested me in the first place and it didn't disappoint me. The art style and the characters are all very charming to watch and listen to. The huge amount of terrible puns are very amusing to me, but I can understand if that's something you'd find to be annoying and grating. The story is mildly interesting, but it's the way it's portrayed that was very good, or at the least laughably bad, depending on your taste. Not many different mechanics are used, mostly just pointing and clicking and at one point you're forced to do a chase sequence which I really didn't see coming.\nWhilst playing I noticed only one bug, heads that didn't move with the body, and at one point my game froze, but that was very easy to fix. I didn't notice anything else.\nThis game doesn't have very high system requirements. Settings you can choose on the other hand are very limited; music on/off, subtitles on/off, a few screen resolutions options and some not very clear graphics quality options. There are only two problems I have with this game. Why is the frame rate locked at 60 fps? Also, this game is very short two and a halve hours at the most. (If you really suck, or your house catches fire or something)\nHonestly, I'm going to recommend this game, but I'd wait for a sale. I think there just not enough game to warrant the price at which it is sold. If there's a sale or it's sold in a bundle with the other episodes, than I'd fully recommend The Adventures of Bertram Fiddle.","May 16, 2015","true","1.8"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","9","9","0","0"

Filled with puns, pop culture references, and all sorts of silliness, the game brings a kind of humour I haven't seen in a point and click before. You play as Bertram Fiddle, professional adventurer, hobbyist sleuth, and full-time pun enthusiast.\nBest detective of all time.\nAdventures of Bertram Fiddle is a 2D point and click story-driven game from Deck13 Interactive. The game offers a charming take on Victorian-era England's gritty, smog filled streets. You solve clues, combine items, and force your Peruvian/Cyclopsian manservant to do all your heavy lifting for you. Bumbling your way through the cobblestone paved roads you find yourself tossed into an adventure and murder mystery when you least expect it. While short, episode 1 offers more than enough puns and adventure for anyone looking for two to three hours worth of entertainment.\n\nGAMEPLAY\n\nAdventures of Bertram Fiddle is a traditional point and click. The game has some action sequences where you have to dodge incoming objects either to run away from or chase after something, and while these action sequences are easy, it offers a clear break in the sleuthing, and really ramps up the pace of the narrative.\nWHAT'S IN THE BAG?\nThe game isn't very hard, but it's entertaining, and in a point and click I think that's mostly what matters. I only was stumped once, and it's because I didn't quite go far enough in a room for the camera to pan over to the object I needed. To get through the game you mostly have to click on everything, but Bertram is humorous enough in his commentary that you want to click on everything. I found myself laughing aloud at some of his funnier puns, although I was slightly disgusted with myself when I did. The mechanic of using your manservant Gavin to assist you with strength based puzzles is also quite clever, although I think it's a little too obvious when you need Gavin to help you.\nGavin has my goal body.\nLike any good point and click, you run into roadblocks, but what makes Adventures of Bertram Fiddle so great is that you don't really mind when you run into them. Since you want to click on everything, and since everything you click offers such entertaining dialogue, you won't mind when you're stuck, and if you do ever get stuck, it won't be for long. The more you explore and the more you experiment with items, the easier the game becomes.\nClick an item to use it, then click on the object.\nThe combination of incredibly funny dialogue mixed with interesting puzzles to solve really brings out Adventures of Bertram's charm.\n\nSTORY\n\nThe story is written well, and the voice acting is pretty spot on. The clues placed aren't obvious enough to make the story ridiculously easy, but easy enough not to spend hours searching for that one damn clue. The pacing of the narrative is good, and the action sequences help pump your adrenaline for when Bertram is in danger. Comedy is the main focal point of the story, as every other line or click has a joke intermixed with the dialogue. I thought the non-stop jokes would get tiresome, but the game is short enough and fast paced enough that you're still laughing by the end. Bertram is an endearing character, and you really want him to beat Sherlock Holmes in the race to find the identity of Geoff the Murderer.\nEver attentive, our Bertram.\nUSER INTERFACE AND ART STYLE\n\nThe interface for Adventures of Bertram is incredibly simple. You click to move anywhere on the screen, and clickable objects form a small circle when you hover over them. There are only ever two visible buttons on the screen; the pause button (a godsend when you need to pause but don't want to miss any story), and the inventory tab.\nThe inventory is simple and nice to look at. Also yes, that is a nose.\nThe inventory tab is easy to maneuver, and you just click and drag to combine any items. The art style is charmingly drawn, and the characters are goofy looking but not ridiculous. I figured out quite quickly that you could double click the next room arrow and you could skip the lengthy walk animation to the next room. This increased the speed of the games drastically, and combined with the skippable dialogue, you can breeze through the game no problem.\nSuch artistry. See how he captures the pain and suffering of the dodo?\nFLAWS\n\nAdventures of Bertram Fiddle doesn't have a great many flaws. Since this is a game for "casuals" listed on steam, you can't complain that it's too easy. It's a game for people who just want to experience a short story, or movie. Although, since it's episodic, I'm assuming there's going to be an $11.00 price point for each episode, which is too much. The game is fun, and entertaining, but I think its 40% off sale price of $6.59 is much more accurate as to what you are going to get. For an $11.00 game I expect more than two and a half hours of content. With being a point and click, there isn't much replayability, so that one experience through the story is all you're getting for that $11.00.  Besides the price, there isn't much I can think in the way of flaws. You know what you're going to get when it comes to Adventures of Bertram Fiddle, and it's a mostly fun experience.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nI had fun. It didn't last crazy long, but that's almost a plus in my book. I paid less money than a movie rental, and got more entertainment time than one too. Bertram's love of puns and adventure really create a world that I want to dive into, and I can't wait for the next installment. An incredibly self-aware game, that doesn't take itself seriously at all, offers a fun and relaxing experience. If you are looking to spend your next couple hours laughing and solving mysteries, Adventures of Bertram Fiddle Episode 1: A Dreadly Business is the game for you.\n\n8/10","April 6, 2015","true","3.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","1"

I enjoyed the art style and general design of the world, and the voice acting, especially, was quite well done.  A lot of games try to be funny, but really aren't; Dreadly Business manages to succeed in actually being amusing, and some of the humor is Monty Python-esque.  There are a number of innuendos that an older crowd will catch, but nothing explicit, so I do not believe it would be too inappropriate for a younger set, either.\n\nPuzzles are intuitive and simple without being insulting; if you are looking for a challenge, however, you will not find it here: few, if any, of the puzzles will force you to think too much.  The pacing is good, and while there will be a bit of backtracking in any game of this genre, Dreadly Business keeps it to a minimum.\n\nMany other reviewers have mentioned the length, and while it is somewhat short (Steam clocks my playthrough at about 3 hours, and there was a bit of idle time in that - many others put it at around 2 hours), I believe the quality makes it easily worth the current $5.99 price tag.  It is an enjoyable romp that can be played in a sitting.","May 20","true","3.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

They’re not exactly a dynamic duo, but unlike a certain French detective they’re at least not bumbling through the case.

It's filled with silly little puns that match the style of the game and the whimsical voice acting. While it looks fun for kids I wouldn't necessarily recommend it as there's mild innuendo.

A lot of the puzzles are solved with a step back, but some do require you to think about it a little more. As a lover of story based games, especially in a comic art style, this really floats my bath- I mean boat.  You'll get that if you play the game.  I can't wait for the second episode, if it truly is as good as the first. A little snippet of Ye Olde London, with a little Sherlock thrown in, this game will have you scratching your head as you piece together someone else's.\n\nThough it is a little short (finishable in under 2 hours) it still is as charming as they come, and if you spent time in the locations, you would truly feel the sense of Olde London, as it is so well conveyed. As mentioned, the art is wonderful, and though occasionally grim, the story will continue to bring a smile to your face, as will Bertram's dialogue.","October 18, 2015","true","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But still i hope for some changes in episode 2\nHeres what i liked and disliked:\n+funny puns and double entendres\n+the vitorian london settings\n+ overall really neat voice acting(exept the main protagonist)\n\n- way to easy "puzzles"\n-Very straight puzzles ( and in this case straight mean, you dont have to search for anything, you will find just the right object in the next room)\n-Very short (2 h max)\n- Bertrams voice ( It's one of these you have to get used to it for some time)\nThis game was on sale approx 1 and a half week ago so i bought it for arround 4 euro i think.\nI played it till the and at this very evening and i really enjoyed the game till the end. But after i realised this was supposed to be the end i was quite disappointed to be honest. I just expected the game to be way longer and the puzzles to get harder along the way. All puzzles for me had a " tutorial" feel for me, even afte the first hour it felt like i still had this "easy and smooth start of an point and click adventure " puzzles. And i was really suprised of this beeing the end of the episode.\nBut still, even if the puzzles were a piece of cake, i still liked the journey till the end. I enjoyed the setting, the weird people and the funny mini games. And the (for me) best part all the puns and double entendres. For example the part in the Ladys Secret Garden. Its clearly made for adults even if the puzzles say different.\nI get that they didn't had enough money and time(because it was funded on kikstarter they had to hurry to show results i guess) but i still think the fun suffers  due to the puzzles.\nThe developers promised to make the next one a little harder so im definitley down for episode two, hoping for the game to be longer and a little more sophisticated\n\n","April 3","true","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

They are called into action when, as Bertram is taking his imperious wife’s dog to the groomers, he is bumped into by a dark and mysterious figure leading to a mix-up of the two’s bags, resulting in the sinister assailant making off with Mrs. Fiddle’s precious pooch and leaving the muddled detective with something far less cute and cuddly… a severed head.\n\nPros:\n\nBoth the graphics and voice acting are top-notch.\n\nThe delightfully simple animation and art style is a joy with the cartoonishly grotesque character designs creating a wonderfully weird and memorable cast.\n\nMost of the humour manages to hit its target, although admittedly isn’t for everyone as the gags venture greatly into the realm of toilet humour and innuendo\n\nThis style of humour compliments the grungy victorian setting whilst also feeling inherently british- the writing didn’t feel too dissimilar to british film studio Aardman Animation, albeit on a much cruder level. This comparison is hardly surprising considering creative director and animator Joe Wood previously worked for the claymation giants, as part of the Flash team.\n\nIts very refreshing to have a point-and-click game that emulates the older classics, where the focus remained on puzzle solving. Lately Telltale Games have set a trend with The Walking Dead series that brings the genre to resemble interactive films, emphasising dialogue trees in cutscenes and action dependent on the player's choices. Whilst a lot of these games are no doubt exceptional, it is still nice to see that the joyous roots of the adventure game have not been forgotten.\n\nA small mechanic that was very much appreciated however was the instant transition to a scene by double clicking on the doorway, thus eliminating the laborious task of watching your character slowly walk from one end of the screen to another when traversing back through the locations- something that is unfortunately present in a lot of old point-and-clicks.\n\nThe brisk pace that I was able to progress through the game at helped the entertaining flow of the story.\n\n\nCons:\n\nThe puzzles themselves, in this first episode at least, are all very simple. There was not one point where I felt particularly challenged or had that magic “ah-ha!” moment when finally figuring out the solution to a head-scratching problem. This will be beneficial for making the game appeal to casual gamers but for veteran fans of the genre the lack of difficulty will prove disappointing.\n\nThe simple layout of the game, whilst aesthetically pleasing, doesn’t leave a whole lot of things to click on so it is never really that challenging to decide what needs to be used with what.\n\nThe episode was very short, taking roughy two hours to complete. This seems a little on the short side to justify the price of £5.99 that it's going for on Steam, and some players will inevitably feel like they haven’t got their money’s worth. That said, it was at least a very pleasurable two hours, and the player may want to revisit to make sure they didn’t miss any of the witty one-liners.\n\n\nBottom Line:\n\nThe Adventures of Bertram Fiddle: Episode 1: A Dreadly Business is a highly amusing way to spend a couple of hours. It thrives on humour and style more than it does in-depth gameplay, which is likely to leave non-causal adventure gamers dissatisfied with its brief length and lack of intricate puzzles. The delightfully grimy story and characters, however, carry the game on their own, and personally I am looking forward to spending more time in this world with episode 2.\n\n\n","August 19, 2015","true","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
