Players would take turns setting down the first four pieces in the center of the board. Because of this, either player could force the “parallel” starting configuration (White White Black Black), rather than the predetermined Othello starting configuration (White Black Black White).\n2- In Reversi, the game is over as soon as either player could not make a move. In Othello and this game, the player without a move simply passes, and the other player makes as many moves as needed before the first player can make a move again. The game is only over once neither player can make a move.","March 20, 2015","true","7.4"," 59 of 64 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","59","64","0","2"

This game is "Othello", not "Reversi" (yes, they are two separate games).  Reversi starts with a blank board whereas Othello starts a game off with four pieces in the center.  The game ends in Reversi when a player can't make a move...in Othello, that player passes.  Based on the way this game plays, it should have been called Othello (though perhaps there were legal reasons for not doing so).  With that said, this isn't a bad game.  It features both offline and online multiplayer, as well as single player against the AI via multiple difficulty levels.  I'd grab it for 40% if you plan to pick this up as $10 might be asking a bit much for how simple this game is (games take 2-3 minutes, if that).\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uu9KEasqIFM","March 19, 2015","true","0.3"," 21 of 30 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","21","30","0","4"

Found the person I talked with polite and friendly and taking my concerns seriously.  (I believe it took them less than a week to fix the problem.)  Good job!\n\nSecond:  This game is very simple... and EXTREMELY difficult.  Each game takes about 5-10 minutes to play so is good for entertaining yourself when have a little break.  I pride myself on being very good with turn-based boardgames but this simulator had me gnashing my teeth a few times.  ;P\n\nIt a very simple game to learn... I gifted an extra copy to a friend and we were challenging each other within 5 minutes of install... but challenging the computer at "Hardest Level" is QUITE another matter.  You may think you winning but the board can change quickly!\n\nTo be honest... I can think ahead about 5-6 moves in chess.  But this game has so fewer variables for the computer to keep track of (in terms of possible moves) that the computer can think ahead maybe 10-12 moves on the more difficult settings.\n\nMy recomendation?  Begin at the easiest level and then increase difficulty as you improve your skill.\n\nBUT BE PREPARED TO BE HUMBLED!\n*Giggle*\n\nPersonal note:  If someone has beaten this on the Hardest difficulty I would *LOVE* to see some sort of guide or strategy-hints.  :D\n\n","August 6, 2015","true","24.1"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","82","9","11","3","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/silversuriv/recommended/307430/","silversuriv","silversuriv","http://steamcommunity.com/id/silversuriv/","1360 products in account","==== Should You Buy This Game? ====The game succeeds in allowing you to play Reversi on Steam utilizing different match parameters including local/online coop and solo play with various difficulty levels. Although I enjoyed playing this game, the UI and graphics along with minimal personalization options leave a desire for more. If you like Reversi at all or want to add another (strategy) board game to your collection, I definitely recommend getting this game.\n\n==== Review ====Reversi is a classic board game, and this Steam game with the same name manages to bring back the old school nostalgia without hampering the gameplay. For those that have never played Reversi before, your objective is to have the majority of stones "flipped" when there are no moves available. Your opponent's stones are flipped when you place an adjacent stone, assuming that a line is created in which your opponent's stones are bounded by yours.\n\nIn this game you have the ability to: play against AI with multiple difficulty levels, pass and play for local coop, or play online against other users. The online feature provides a game browser with custom matches including ranked play. You even have the ability to utilize asynchronous play - you can quit the game and receive a notification when it's your turn. The online community seems to be hanging on by a thread, though it's possible I looked at the browser list at unpopular times.\n\nRegarding solo play, the AI is fairly difficult on Hard and above difficulty levels (Beginner < Easy < Medium < Hard < Harder < Hardest). As a casual player, I get crushed almost every time playing the higher difficulties. Due to this, I really would have liked an easy Restart button. There is also no save feature against the AI for those that like to play at a slower pace or come back at another time.\n\n==== Score ====Good\n- 7/10","May 20","true","2.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I've been playing Reversi/Othello for a long time, as well as have been researching board and card games, and I have never encountered a version that didn't start with four pieces in the center, and I've always found "Reversi" and "Othello" used interchangeably.  But games like this are old and acquire many rules over time.  Who can really say, and does it really matter that much?\n\nNow, as for the game itself, don't buy it unless it's on a pretty heavy sale.  I waited until it fell down to about $3, and had I paid a dime more than that I'd have been pretty upset.  While functional it lacks polish.  Only two varieties of pieces, no varieties of boards or backgrounds.  The background music is annoying with no other options.  The sound effects are grating.  Seems like small stuff, but they are all things that should be present for $10 whole wing-wangs.  In 3-D mode the pieces flip over in a very satisfying way, but if you make a large capture the computer goes immediately after while your pieces are still flipping.  And if you make a large capture, and the computer makes a large capture, your first pieces could be flipping back before your captured pieces are finished turning over.  I find it to be incredibly annoying.\n\nAll of these seems like small complaints and they are, but to be charging $10 I'd expect a lot more.  I'd expect a lot more especially when you can just google "Reversi" or "Othello" and find a low tech flash version on a website and play for free.  So save your $10 and put it towards a real Othello/Reversi board you can buy at any Toys'R'us.","May 29, 2015","false","0.2"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","1"

I don't mean this actual game, I mean othello or whatever people refer to it as. It wasn't my cup of tea, to say the least.\n\nThe AI is great and actually offers a challenge, or it could be that I was so bad that even the low level AI's were better than me. Regardless, if you can't play against people online for some reason, the computer seems to be plenty good enough to challenge you. It also allows you to play versus your friend through couch co op, it looks like.\n\nOverall, this game is smooth and worth your time, if you like reversi/othello to begin with. I didn't enjoy it but that's not the developer's fault or anything so don't blame him. Also, the developer was responding to just about every thread in the discussion forum so that is pretty phenomenal.\n\nGet this game if you like reversi/othello and you won't be disappointed.

However, beware.  The computer player?... this is just ludicrously difficult.  I don't believe you can win on the harder levels without absolutely perfect play.  I started on Medium, because that's what I'd normally do with a game I know this well, and it's just unbelievably difficult.  I went back to Beginner - aced that.  Easy - aced that.  Medium?  I played 20-30 games and the closest I got was a 4-point loss where the computer held every corner.\n\nThis isn't a "fun" game against the computer, it's totally unbalanced.  Good for online, maybe, and the pass-and-play mode, but it's just a basic game at the core with a computer player that's not levelled properly whatsoever.\n\nThose people with the achievement for beating the Hardest level?  Yeah, I don't believe it.  Either they used an achievement manager, or they just sheer played one computer off against another.  There's no way 2% of players can beat Hardest level.","August 7, 2015","true","4.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"
