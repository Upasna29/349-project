"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dragoonsz/recommended/470760/","dragoonsz","¬± Roger","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dragoonsz/","4394 products in account","Product received for free\n\nAntiflux\nDISCLAIMER: I received this product for no cost for the purpose of reviewing.\n\nAntiflux is a game about making it to the end of the stage and progressing to newer stages using the abilities you come across, as well as solving puzzles that are in your way. This 2D puzzle-platformer also falls under a metroidvainia category, which means that there's quite a bit of exploring and backtracking that can be done with the discovery of new abilities. This also means that there are different ways to complete puzzles depending on what abilities you choose to use.\n\n--------\n\nGraphics: 6 / 10\n\nThe art assets are fine. Though nothing really stuck out as "amazing" to me, there is a lot of nice background scenes and terrains that look pretty cool. The art-style is suitable for the theme of the game, and there are nice visuals when using skills and abilities. The background and foreground are not cluttered, which is a good thing. This allows the player to focus on the objects that are needed to progress, like; which teleporter to take, or which platforms to jump on. The game's graphics are not that demanding, meaning that most cards and CPUs should run the game smoothly.\n\n--------\n\nSound: 6 / 10\n\nThe Antiflux soundtrack is quite nice. The melodies range from calming and soothing ambient sounds to more intense or upbeat tracks. You can listen to the OST for free on the developer's Soundcloud page. The sound assets are fine and none of the sound effects or background music get repetitive unless you spend a prolonged period of time within the stage. Although none of the music in the game really grabbed me, it still wasn't bad.\n\n--------\n\nMechanics: 7 / 10\n\nThe mechanics of the game are really solid, and this is where the game shines. Like many games in this genre, you start off with no real abilities, and as you progress, you gain new skills. Using these skills, you can progress even further and overcome obstacles. There are many obstacles such as enemy robots that move in a certain way, portals you and the enemy can use, different platforms/boxes, jump pads, teleporters and lasers. I\'m sure there are more challenges and objects as the game continues on.\n\nThe puzzle element of the game gets more and more difficult as you progress and really makes you think hard sometimes. You instantly die if you''re hit by a laser or enemy so you have to plan your moves carefully. There are also some obstacles that change the level permanently (until you die or reset the level of course). The puzzles are designed well and give you a satisfying feeling once you complete them.\n\n--------\n\nPersonal Final Remarks:\n\nAntiflux is one of those games that I feel like; if you try it, and then complete a puzzle, you'll continue to crave that satisfying feeling of accomplishment. It could keep you playing for longer than you expect. Despite this, puzzle-platformers are not games that I enjoy very much. Probably since I'm awful at puzzle games in general and I get frustrated easily. So although this game might not be for me, I could see how many others would enjoy it. It also keeps track of the time it took you to complete certain stages within the game itself, so it's also a game for speed runners to take part in.\n\nThanks to the Devs for giving me the opportunity to review the game, as well as anyone who took this review into consideration, I hope it helped.","May 31","true","2.6"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

The puzzles are challenging and force you to think, but are still fun. The game is a little buggy, the visuals aren't the best, and I had trouble understanding the story. Still though, its a fun game that's worth checking out, especially when its on sale.","May 19","true","0.7"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"
