If you want to look at this way, you could definitely say that it is very similar to TF2, but that's not necessarily bad - in fact, it's great! Wild Warfare is almost like the alternative we've been looking for. Put a cone on your bear and shoot a bunch of raccoons with your mini gun - family-friendly! You won't find blood and gore in the game, it is definitely something I wouldn't show your 5 year old, most likely an "Everyone 10 and up" game.\n\nUnfortunately, the game is very inactive now. Not lots of players anymore, not lots of maps, barely any classes, only four game modes, two of which are pretty much the same. However, the game is still in beta mode, so you have to give it time. UNFORTUNATELY, the devs are focusing on games that are making them the most money. So for now, the game is pretty dead... regardless of this, however, I will give it a positive review and recommend it, in hopes that the developers will notice it again, and because, well, it is a good game that has lots of potential.","July 21, 2015","true","212.9"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","14","14","0","0"

Simple vanilla combat, 3 classes (to date) and no complicated combat system that most modern shooters tend to have. Just straightfoward combat/objective based gameplay. But the player base isn't even in the tens. Hell I even switched to an asian server so I could play with players.

I'll be honest, this game is fun, but very limited. In terms of mechanics, it's extremely limited. The game consists with 3 classes, 2 of which are played by most users because the last one is usless. It's like Team Fortress 2 except with only the heavy and the scout. Graphics wise, this game looks half decent. The cartoony feel is great and all, but the textures don't seem to make me very interested. Other than that, this game is fun if you have friends to play with. If you don't, then it'll be total boredom. Over all, it's extremely limited, but if you wanna have a quick laugh with your buddys, or are interested with a nice concept, I'll recommend this.\n\nI'll give it a 6.5/10","February 2, 2015","true","0.2"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","42"

I have one word for this game. Addictive. Oh, and fun. So I guess it's two words... Anyways, the game is very simple to understand and very classy for a FPS. Right now, the game features 3 classes. Striker, Engineer, and the Heavy. My favorite class as of right now is the Engineer.\n\nThe Engineer has the ability to double jump, as well as move very quickly. The Engineer attacks with a monkey wrench, which does a ton of damage. The game also features Vehicles. The one vehicle that is available right now, is the Raptor. When you are controlling it, you have the ability to fire rockets which does massive damage. In all, Wild Warfare is a fantastic little game that is just getting started. With more maps, classes, items, vehicles, modes, and MORE on the way, this game is definitely worth the price of $7.\n\nFight. Focus. Win.

Wild Warfare is a neat fps, you play one of three classes in a variety of game modes. The classes are all anthropomorphic animals, so that is one of the games draws for alot of people. There are a good amount of customizations as well, that you earn through progress in the game. You get the crates through killing enemys and you get the keys through leveling up. I find this method a pretty effective one in the long term.\n\nThe game has only 2 drawbacks in my opinion. One is that there is not a whole lot of content, and two is that there is a low playerbase. These go hand in hand in my opinion, the more players the more content you generally get. Overall though Wild Warfare is a simple shooter, and I like it the way it is.

It's simple, and it's executed well given the context of this game. Plus, for once, this game IS NOT pay-to-win. You earn crates and keys by playing the game, and as such the better you do, the more crates and keys you obtain. I LOVE this type of system. I wish this model were used for more games, as it makes you feel like you're getting somewhere when you get those crates and keys.

This review is based on only two games that I've played in, so people who have played Wild Warfare for a lot longer than I have will probably be able to form a better review than the one you're reading right now.\n\nThis review has been slightly edited in regards to the game now being free to play but many of the issues still stand currently.\n\nI've found Wild Warfare heavily reminding me of arena-shooters such as Unreal tournament, and that in itself brings back many happy memories, memories that I hope to make in Wild Warfare. Unfortunately there are a few issues in the current version of this game that prevent me from outright recommending it to anyone, and I hope these issues get fixed soon (or at the very least tweaked to be a little more bearable then they are now).\n\nStarting with some of the pros I found in my short playthrough:\n\nMap selection in Wild Warfare is small, but the maps do feel nice and and are well-designed (for the most part, there is one exception with the current CTF map with jump-pads at the back of each base, which makes for relatively quick captures and seems to be very infuriating to players, going off by what I see in their discussion board). The maps aren't too large as to make finding other players impossible and there are several jump-pads around the maps, which speeds up travelling around these maps significantly, so you shouldn't be without someone to shoot at for long in a game.\n\nThe music in the game sounds nice, the artwork in the game is cute and inviting. Not much more to say here (mostly because I know next to nothing about music and art).\n\nOne of the things I especially liked was the fact that when you level up, you can get keys to open crates, which makes a huge difference (to me, anyway). I really hope this stays, as it offers some customization options for free to play players, which this game is supposedly going to be, though I don't see the option for free to play on steam yet (Though it seems you can play a browser-based version for free at Hyperhippo.ca).\n\nOne thing to note to parents looking at this game: Yes, there is no blood and gore or foul language, so if for some reason you want to introduce a young one to shooters, then you probably want to pick this up. Bear in mind though that this isn't accounting for any foul words that may come from strangers online.\n\nHas a decent variety of game modes with another on the way it seems.\n\nSeems to perform well on computers that have low specs (I have one terrible rig, so finding games that run on it is a blessing).\n\nOnto some cons I found while playing:\n\nWhat you see is what you get on your class. There are currently three classes in the game, and each has a different weapon; The engineer has a wrench, the heavy has a minigun, and the striker has a burst assault rifle. That's it. That's all they got. Weapon selection is not very big at this moment in time, though it does make it relatively simple to easily glance at a furry critter's hands (paws, for those that want to get technical with it) and look at the only weapon they have.\n\nBullet speed is slow, which slows down the pace of the game quite a bit for the firearms at anything beyond 'medium-range', which may not be a particularly bad thing as it encourages you to get closer to land shots easier, but a slight increase in bullet speed would be welcome.\n\nThere's no way to crouch in the game, which I didn't find as too big a deal since weapons don't have any recoil at all, but it's something to be noted.\n\nYou can't make your own servers at this time.\n\nThere are exploitable bugs and glitches that can seriously break the flow of a game (there appears to be an auto-firing bug, which happened quite a bit for me), which I hope are fixed soon.\n\nServers aren't the best, you'll see players floating in the sky and you can get hit by the engineer's wrench when they're a few feet away and nowhere near melee range. You won't have to worry about the servers, however, unless you can find a game with people. Not many people are currently online at a time, so it'll take awhile for you to find a server with people playing on it sometimes. However, with the game now being free to play, I expect a few servers with people in them, so perhaps the game population will increase in due time.\n\nClasses aren't balanced at this time, with the heavy being underpowered, the striker being balanced, and the engineer being overpowered (at least, when it came to CTF, unsure of how the engineer performs in the other modes).\n\nWhile not a con, something I'd like to bring up is competition from other games. When reading about the game it sounds quite a bit like Team Fortress two, doesn't it? It even has hats. Yes, I'm aware Team Fortress two doesn't have vehicles but otherwise it seems like it'll be very much the same. Wild Warfare also references Team Fortress two through an achievement, so it's safe to say that they are at least aware of Team fortress two (then again you'd have to be under a rock not to). While I don't expect it to ever overtake Team Fortress two in terms of popularity, I do think it'll at least get a stable community of players, especially since it's also a free to play game that has a slight Team Fortress two vibe at first glance. I'm looking forward to how things will turn out!\n\nWell, that's about all I can say from my two games worth of experience. As stated earlier I cannot recommend the game in its current state, however I do enjoy playing it and would like to in the future. I can't give a definite answer to if you should buy this game or not, but currently, I am content with most of the things I see, and I only hope this game gets better.","July 22, 2014","false","1.3"," 26 of 48 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","26","48","0","0"

(An all around class, a speedy class with weaker stats, and a slow class with better stats) This game has improved and has lots of potential for being a fun FPS. If you aren't into gore, real blood, and real weapons, this is a good example of an alternative. It has a variety of gamemodes including CTF and what some people might call "Team Deathmatch" and "Free for all".

It's an odd mix, and a fresh feeling to play something so different. I expected it to be a silly, 30 minute game that I'd regret installing... Instead, I played until my hands hurt. That doesn't happen often.\n\nThree classes might seem small to those of you who have played TF2, but don't dismiss this game because of the low character selection. You've gotta give it a shot first! You'd be surprised how much fun it is to play as either a squirrel, a bunny, or a big, fat bear with a gigantic machine gun. It resembles TF2 in a lot of ways, sure, but not enough to feel the EXACT same. It has its own definite combat touch to it, and yet, it's still under-developed thus far.\n\nYes, dearest review readers. At this time, it's buggy. The loadout boxes and key thing is weird, and almost seems rushed. The CPU plant enemies don't exactly play nice, nor do they act as they should, (I doubt they're supposed to move that fast,) and finally, the lag is ridiculous! But, all in all, excellent gaming experience in my opinion!\n\nIt's got potential; a lot more potential than certain games lurking around Steam, and for what it's worth, I can already tell that this is gonna be one addicting game later on down the road. How could it not? You get beaten to death by bunnies, shoot at roadents, capture flags, and go wild!\n\n...

Don't look at the playtime, I got more playtime, like 5 hours, due the fact i was playing via web version. First you got 3 unique classes which totally difference from each other, the levels are not many, still early access, but they are quite fun. You have many obstacles as some berry like creatures to chase and eat you, exploding crates which you can use to blow the enemy, power ups, hot streams which shoot you up, similar to jumps on quake 3 which makes game pretty fun.\n\nDeathmatch is fun, because of the neutral enemies, those are quite nasty and hard to run from, but they gives you points too, so if you are having skills, you can win the game counting on them.\n\nCapture the flag, there you have yuge robot to control which helps you to support the team or guard your flag, you have speed ups many places to barricade yourself  and guard, many place to stuck enemy into a trap between exploding crates.\n\nTeam Deathmatch, again differs from usual gameplay, you should just check the game and see that it looks more fun than the videos.\n\nWhat is expected.\nAs far as i know new classes, maps, customizations and friend invitations are planned. So I'm expecting good stuff from the game now.\n\nBad things here.\nThe only drawbacks, the game crashes at me somehow before joining, happened several times. No clan-tags and avatar support and nothing was mentioned for those. Needs more perks, double damage, double health, etc, which will really make the gameplay more intensive.\nNo LAN support or dedicated server announced.\n\nPay to play - pay to win?\nNah, the game at it's current stage is free to play and has no microtrasactions, they stated that they are planning to add payment methods and I hope that will not overpower some players compared to another when product is finished in the future, because it will disbalance it greatly which is not cool thing for shooter.\n\nGameplay goes well!\nThe game plays smooth, characters are not lagging out or glitching into objects despite the edgy areas, it has nice dynamics, movements are good, aiming is very nicely done. Sometimes it takes quite much of skills to bring down your enemy as they dodges your shooting pretty good too.\nThe only thing that nagged me about shooting from higher place is that your shooting hits the ground so you should expose yourself from your cover to kill someone, still that is not something bad, you should just pay more caution on your cover then.\n\nI recommend the game, especially because lack of pay to joy, it is pretty fun in the current state and I really hope they to keep it that way.\n\n","September 15, 2014","true","1.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

One which said something about if you think this game is for kids and cute animals they were saying you are wrong.... really? How many games has that person even played? All this game is, is something that wants to be the new TF2. That's what this game feels like. As if all it wants to be is the new TF2. Why am I recommending it with a thumbs up? It's not invalid for what it advertises itself to be. It's a shooting game. A bunch of animals running around. It is what it offers. If you go into this game expecting anything else... well. that's on you. Do I believe it is worth spending my time on? No, not really. It reminds me of that older game with the same concept, called small arms I think it was. This game itself be it in early access or not. It's not bad, it's not good. It's just little animal figures running around shooting.... With toon like level graphics in a way. If you are into that sort of thing. Then you should like this. If you want some hardcore FPS with tiny cute animal slaughter... This isn't that. The game is legit for what it advertises. That's why it recieves the thumbs up vote.","September 8, 2014","true","0.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

(i dont know if it is me or what) when playing a game, you'll suddenly get kicked out of a game, even if your number 1 in that lobby, you'll get kicked, and wont gain XP when you can ride a vehical at lvl 5. but you'll get kicked out and will never get a single expericene point...\n2.) collecting items on the map, just goes to customizeing your character you might use, but thats just it as far as customizeing your character.\n3.) only 3 game modes, and three characters, and the Solider is very over power, with the Heavy oddly being the most worthless character to play as. did i mention it borrows from TF2. with the Solider having Unlimited Ammo. and the engineer having nothing but a wrench, but iv seen other plays go Ham and Cheese with Engineer.\n4.) if it hasnt been said once, then it'll be said again, it is an empty game, with hardly anyone online on the servers with about a lobby open with barely any players.\n\ni wouldnt really recommend the game, until the game can get itself fixed and can get its own id, because i feel like its a TF2 clone, but replaced with furrys. not that there is anything wrong with furrys, i am one (just not the ones who take it a step further) but it is not a good game to be playing, until they can fix what is wrong with the game, then this is not a recommended game to be playing. dispite the game getting postive reviews its not recommended","November 5, 2014","false","1.9"," 10 of 20 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","10","20","0","0"

Maybe, little kids would like to play it.  Looks like a mobile device port.    I would say this game needs a lot more work before it can get a yes.  Has no hacker sensors,  Low population of players.  Game is too simplified.  I don't like, rather play TF2.\n\n3 classes: Striker raccoon with assault rifle,  Heavy bear with minigun, engineer rabbit with melee wrench.  Health is like a small number, so i guess each shot does 1 damage.  1 weapon only on each class.  At level 5, you can drive the big Mecha, with its heavy armor and guns.

And the game is currently mostly empty, BUT, for being so early a early access, it has a LOT of potential(And open to your ideas), and on a full server, things get rather chaotic and fun. The game is similar to TF2 but with animals, and mechs. There isn't much to it now, but it can be fun and plays smoothly enough, I would recommend playing this and dropping some feed back, even if you just play it for a few minutes. If this ends up popular enough, and gets money on kickstarter, we just may get a game that might even rival that of TF2.

Players seem to lag switch  ( if you dont know what that is it's when a bad player lags them selves so it looks like they  are in one spot when they are not)\n5. THE ENGINEER  this class is down right  cheap I.E. they can leave the map to hide  from those using guns  like in snail hunt  at times they can hit you when they are not even close to you.    I THINK THIS CLASS SHOULD BE REMOVED  Or this the double jump so have a cool down for them.\n6.

TO MANY PLAYERS USING THE AUTO FIRE GLITCH FOR THE STIKER (who can only do three round brust not full auto)\n2. Players floating in the air at times\n3. Some players seem to have way more HP then the class should (how do I know maybe cause I shoot them in the back like 15 times an they are still alive)\n4. Players seem to lag switch  ( if you dont know what that is it's when a bad player lags them selves so it looks like they  are in one spot when they are not)\n5. THE ENGINEER  this class is down right  cheap I.E. they can leave the map to hide  from those using guns  like in snail hunt  at times they can hit you when they are not even close to you.    I THINK THIS CLASS SHOULD BE REMOVED  Or this the double jump so have a cool down for them.\n6.  At times it seems players are using a auto aim bot  on you\n\nit's not a bad game an it is fun when player dont   cheat  using the glitches  as if you have to cheat in a PVP  game it just proves to me an other how bad you  really are at games","August 3, 2014","true","33.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

With aspects similar to tf2 and a REALLY good soundtrack, this game currently has me at a love hate relationship with it. You get to choose to play as the Striker ( an assault rifle toting racoon (guardians of the galaxy, anyone??)), a heavy (well... the heavy.) and the engineer (a bunny that runs around whacking people with a wrench, so demoknight...?) Anyway, the combat is surprisingly fun, and the fighting seems balanced. The only thing that makes this game bad is the fact that players who make use of the bunny hop (and some people LITERALLY doing the bunny hop as a bunny) make the combat seem broken, and some aspects of the game like opening crates or trying to get into that amazing looking Titanfall mech are just broken. Other than that, this game is pretty good and should, as always, only be played by people who are used to early access.","September 6, 2014","true","3.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Like TF2 dumbed down, basically. Each class has one weapon, raccoon 'striker' shoots 3 shots 1 damage each and can aim down sights 4 hp, rabbit 'engineer' has a wrench and whacks people with it for 2 damage each and has 3 hp may or may not run fast, bear 'heavy' that has a minigun that can overheat with bullets that deal 1 damage each moves slowly and has 8 hp.\n\nThere are different modes but you can't mode select, it choses for you. FFA, team deathmatch, and capture the flag from what I saw. Vehicles are 'level locked' which basically means if you didn't play enough matches before entering the match with a vehicle you can't use it. The game feels floaty, I could barely hit someone going up a ramp in a straight line.\n\nIn the capture the flag mode, people can pick up a speed power up before picking the flag up to get it away faster, but not with the flag equipped. You can't drop things either, as far as I can tell from the 'rebindable keys.' There is no chat, may have removed it? In FFA mode there was a snail I picked up as far as I could tell did nothing, and since I couldn't drop it, I threw myself into the lava.\n\nThe AI in the game is dumb, and if you sneak up behind them you have a 50 50 they won't turn around and attack you back, but since most of this game is killing people by sneaking up behind them (3 shot burst for quick kill as a striker, hitting them with the wrench as the bunny, doing a quick gun down as a heavy) there's rarely a time to pick a fair fight by going up in front about it due to low HP and high damage.\n\nThe only redeeming factor I could see is the cosmetics, which you randomly got per level some keys to open crates that dropped from enemies. I didn't see a cash shop other than the DLC they had on the store, which wasn't too highly priced either. I guess the main reason this hasn't been updated in 2 years is due to no money and being FTP, but still isn't worth playing imo.","February 22, 2015","false","0.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Players participate in team-based objectives and large maps, with multiple game modes and a different animal for every class type.\n\nThis game is a diamond in the rough that REALLY shines. It could do with a few more updates like new maps, gamemodes and maybe characters even though they are pretty perfect already. They are well balanced and each have their strong suits. The customization options are absolutely brilliant. Facepaint, bow ties, top hats and many more and they're pretty easy to unlock to! Wild Warfare isn't without flaws, (which game isn't?) but the satisfaction of killing another player is immense and pays off really well. It nails that one more go feeling and can get quite intense in certain gamemodes.\nTalking about gamemodes, some of them could be improved. The worst is the Snail Gamemode where a player can collect the snail which gives them one point per second. This can be quite an annoying mode because people always win by a landslide. So watch out for that.\n\nOverall this unusual and unique FPS game is a great game to spice up your free time. It's nowhere near a P2W either. You'll be on the edge of your seats in the intense battles. What are you waiting for? Go download that game!\n\n(╯°□°)╯   9/10","August 1, 2015","true","3.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Players participate in team-based objectives and large maps, with multiple game modes and a different animal for every class type.\n\nThis game is a diamond in the rough that REALLY shines. It could do with a few more updates like new maps, gamemodes and maybe characters even though they are pretty perfect already. They are well balanced and each have their strong suits. The customization options are absolutely brilliant. Facepaint, bow ties, top hats and many more and they're pretty easy to unlock to! Wild Warfare isn't without flaws, (which game isn't?) but the satisfaction of killing another player is immense and pays off really well. It nails that one more go feeling and can get quite intense in certain gamemodes.\nTalking about gamemodes, some of them could be improved. The worst is the Snail Gamemode where a player can collect the snail which gives them one point per second. This can be quite an annoying mode because people always win by a landslide. So watch out for that.\n\nOverall this unusual and unique FPS game is a great game to spice up your free time. It's nowhere near a P2W either. You'll be on the edge of your seats in the intense battles. What are you waiting for? Go download that game!\n\n(╯°□°)╯   9/10","August 1, 2015","true","3.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

If you want to look at this way, you could definitely say that it is very similar to TF2, but that's not necessarily bad - in fact, it's great! Wild Warfare is almost like the alternative we've been looking for. Put a cone on your bear and shoot a bunch of raccoons with your mini gun - family-friendly! You won't find blood and gore in the game, it is definitely something I wouldn't show your 5 year old, most likely an "Everyone 10 and up" game.\n\nUnfortunately, the game is very inactive now. Not lots of players anymore, not lots of maps, barely any classes, only four game modes, two of which are pretty much the same. However, the game is still in beta mode, so you have to give it time. UNFORTUNATELY, the devs are focusing on games that are making them the most money. So for now, the game is pretty dead... regardless of this, however, I will give it a positive review and recommend it, in hopes that the developers will notice it again, and because, well, it is a good game that has lots of potential.","July 21, 2015","true","212.9"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","14","14","0","0"

What about when someone Hijacks you Name and literally steals your XPs ...AS YOU ARE PLAYING!! My last 2 screenshots for this incident would not even post to the Games Forum Pics on Steam so that i could show this CHEAT! and many excuses issued for outright blatent cheating was instantly answered for my complaints and they claimed this was not a real player STEALING my XP's ...YET this same player appears throught the game as a player through years of screenshots Soooo my only conclusion this is deliberate and I dare say it is Creators using unfair means to keep GOOD players from excelling ,If i signed up and Paid for their premium service I bet this would not happen!\nLet real players play free to play people ,and keep the cheating a PAYING customers play THEMSELVES or dont even bother calling a game FREE 2 PLAY...otherwise your just using people as cannon fodder for Elitists who can afford the privledges of winning (at the expense of others) what a waste of time cannot even enjoy a game by peoples actual gaming Merrits! :(  How truly sad for you people who think you deserve to win ALL the time!","March 24, 2015","false","1.5"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

This game. THIS GAME. It sucks.\n\nIt's a Team Fortress 2 clone, but it doesn't even deserve to be called that. You have a choice of 3 characters, with no good explanation of what they are great at. The rabbit is so useless. As far as I have played, I can't even figure out if I can choose a different gun or build something.\n\nNodody plays the game at all. I went on an official server and only 6 PEOPLE were on there.\n\nHowever, Team Fortress 2 is an excellent game. You have more characters, more weapons to choose from, more people to play with, and more maps. Play that instead. Think it is too violent?

I'll be honest, this game is fun, but very limited. In terms of mechanics, it's extremely limited. The game consists with 3 classes, 2 of which are played by most users because the last one is usless. It's like Team Fortress 2 except with only the heavy and the scout. Graphics wise, this game looks half decent. The cartoony feel is great and all, but the textures don't seem to make me very interested. Other than that, this game is fun if you have friends to play with. If you don't, then it'll be total boredom. Over all, it's extremely limited, but if you wanna have a quick laugh with your buddys, or are interested with a nice concept, I'll recommend this.\n\nI'll give it a 6.5/10","February 2, 2015","true","0.2"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","42"

I have one word for this game. Addictive. Oh, and fun. So I guess it's two words... Anyways, the game is very simple to understand and very classy for a FPS. Right now, the game features 3 classes. Striker, Engineer, and the Heavy. My favorite class as of right now is the Engineer.\n\nThe Engineer has the ability to double jump, as well as move very quickly. The Engineer attacks with a monkey wrench, which does a ton of damage. The game also features Vehicles. The one vehicle that is available right now, is the Raptor. When you are controlling it, you have the ability to fire rockets which does massive damage. In all, Wild Warfare is a fantastic little game that is just getting started.

Wild Warfare is a neat fps, you play one of three classes in a variety of game modes. The classes are all anthropomorphic animals, so that is one of the games draws for alot of people. There are a good amount of customizations as well, that you earn through progress in the game. You get the crates through killing enemys and you get the keys through leveling up. I find this method a pretty effective one in the long term.\n\nThe game has only 2 drawbacks in my opinion. One is that there is not a whole lot of content, and two is that there is a low playerbase. These go hand in hand in my opinion, the more players the more content you generally get. Overall though Wild Warfare is a simple shooter, and I like it the way it is.

The game is simple; You take the role as one of three cute animals with guns and a wrench, collectively, and are tasked with capture the flag, hold the snail, team deathmatcand free-for-all. It's simple, and it's executed well given the context of this game. Plus, for once, this game IS NOT pay-to-win. You earn crates and keys by playing the game, and as such the better you do, the more crates and keys you obtain. I LOVE this type of system. I wish this model were used for more games, as it makes you feel like you're getting somewhere when you get those crates and keys.

This review is based on only two games that I've played in, so people who have played Wild Warfare for a lot longer than I have will probably be able to form a better review than the one you're reading right now.\n\nThis review has been slightly edited in regards to the game now being free to play but many of the issues still stand currently.\n\nI've found Wild Warfare heavily reminding me of arena-shooters such as Unreal tournament, and that in itself brings back many happy memories, memories that I hope to make in Wild Warfare. Unfortunately there are a few issues in the current version of this game that prevent me from outright recommending it to anyone, and I hope these issues get fixed soon (or at the very least tweaked to be a little more bearable then they are now).\n\nStarting with some of the pros I found in my short playthrough:\n\nMap selection in Wild Warfare is small, but the maps do feel nice and and are well-designed (for the most part, there is one exception with the current CTF map with jump-pads at the back of each base, which makes for relatively quick captures and seems to be very infuriating to players, going off by what I see in their discussion board). The maps aren't too large as to make finding other players impossible and there are several jump-pads around the maps, which speeds up travelling around these maps significantly, so you shouldn't be without someone to shoot at for long in a game.\n\nThe music in the game sounds nice, the artwork in the game is cute and inviting. Not much more to say here (mostly because I know next to nothing about music and art).\n\nOne of the things I especially liked was the fact that when you level up, you can get keys to open crates, which makes a huge difference (to me, anyway). I really hope this stays, as it offers some customization options for free to play players, which this game is supposedly going to be, though I don't see the option for free to play on steam yet (Though it seems you can play a browser-based version for free at Hyperhippo.ca).\n\nOne thing to note to parents looking at this game: Yes, there is no blood and gore or foul language, so if for some reason you want to introduce a young one to shooters, then you probably want to pick this up. Bear in mind though that this isn't accounting for any foul words that may come from strangers online.\n\nHas a decent variety of game modes with another on the way it seems.\n\nSeems to perform well on computers that have low specs (I have one terrible rig, so finding games that run on it is a blessing).\n\nOnto some cons I found while playing:\n\nWhat you see is what you get on your class. There are currently three classes in the game, and each has a different weapon; The engineer has a wrench, the heavy has a minigun, and the striker has a burst assault rifle. That's it. That's all they got. Weapon selection is not very big at this moment in time, though it does make it relatively simple to easily glance at a furry critter's hands (paws, for those that want to get technical with it) and look at the only weapon they have.\n\nBullet speed is slow, which slows down the pace of the game quite a bit for the firearms at anything beyond 'medium-range', which may not be a particularly bad thing as it encourages you to get closer to land shots easier, but a slight increase in bullet speed would be welcome.\n\nThere's no way to crouch in the game, which I didn't find as too big a deal since weapons don't have any recoil at all, but it's something to be noted.\n\nYou can't make your own servers at this time.\n\nThere are exploitable bugs and glitches that can seriously break the flow of a game (there appears to be an auto-firing bug, which happened quite a bit for me), which I hope are fixed soon.\n\nServers aren't the best, you'll see players floating in the sky and you can get hit by the engineer's wrench when they're a few feet away and nowhere near melee range. You won't have to worry about the servers, however, unless you can find a game with people. Not many people are currently online at a time, so it'll take awhile for you to find a server with people playing on it sometimes. However, with the game now being free to play, I expect a few servers with people in them, so perhaps the game population will increase in due time.\n\nClasses aren't balanced at this time, with the heavy being underpowered, the striker being balanced, and the engineer being overpowered (at least, when it came to CTF, unsure of how the engineer performs in the other modes).\n\nWhile not a con, something I'd like to bring up is competition from other games. When reading about the game it sounds quite a bit like Team Fortress two, doesn't it? It even has hats. Yes, I'm aware Team Fortress two doesn't have vehicles but otherwise it seems like it'll be very much the same. Wild Warfare also references Team Fortress two through an achievement, so it's safe to say that they are at least aware of Team fortress two (then again you'd have to be under a rock not to). While I don't expect it to ever overtake Team Fortress two in terms of popularity, I do think it'll at least get a stable community of players, especially since it's also a free to play game that has a slight Team Fortress two vibe at first glance. I'm looking forward to how things will turn out!\n\nWell, that's about all I can say from my two games worth of experience. As stated earlier I cannot recommend the game in its current state, however I do enjoy playing it and would like to in the future. I can't give a definite answer to if you should buy this game or not, but currently, I am content with most of the things I see, and I only hope this game gets better.","July 22, 2014","false","1.3"," 26 of 48 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","26","48","0","0"

If you aren't into gore, real blood, and real weapons, this is a good example of an alternative. It has a variety of gamemodes including CTF and what some people might call "Team Deathmatch" and "Free for all".

The content is too bare to really call it a game. Thankfully it is free to play, otherwise I would've just dismissed this game and called it a waste of money. Instead, I see it as a waste of time. There is very little content in this game, and it's in very early alpha. I find it a poor choice to release a public access to such a tile that has yet to offer anything really meaningful.\n\nThe combat is boring and has an identity crisis of what it truly wants to be. It's part Quake/Unreal Tournament, part Class-based warfare, but it doesn't do justice to either of the two. It isn't as fast based as Quake/Unreal Tournament and it doesn't offer enough diversity between the 3 current classes to really feel like a new experience each time you select a class.\n\nThe map design is plain and offers the basic jump-pads of an arena style shooter, as well as the med-kits. However, it lacks any extra weapons to pick up so you are stuck with the only weapon your class possesses.\n\nI would like to see this game evolve into something greater, but as it stands now, it isn't even worth the download.","January 7, 2015","false","0.2"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

It's an odd mix, and a fresh feeling to play something so different. I expected it to be a silly, 30 minute game that I'd regret installing... Instead, I played until my hands hurt. That doesn't happen often.\n\nThree classes might seem small to those of you who have played TF2, but don't dismiss this game because of the low character selection. You've gotta give it a shot first! You'd be surprised how much fun it is to play as either a squirrel, a bunny, or a big, fat bear with a gigantic machine gun. It resembles TF2 in a lot of ways, sure, but not enough to feel the EXACT same. It has its own definite combat touch to it, and yet, it's still under-developed thus far.\n\nYes, dearest review readers. At this time, it's buggy. The loadout boxes and key thing is weird, and almost seems rushed. The CPU plant enemies don't exactly play nice, nor do they act as they should, (I doubt they're supposed to move that fast,) and finally, the lag is ridiculous! But, all in all, excellent gaming experience in my opinion!\n\nIt's got potential; a lot more potential than certain games lurking around Steam, and for what it's worth, I can already tell that this is gonna be one addicting game later on down the road. How could it not? You get beaten to death by bunnies, shoot at roadents, capture flags, and go wild!\n\n...

Don't look at the playtime, I got more playtime, like 5 hours, due the fact i was playing via web version. First you got 3 unique classes which totally difference from each other, the levels are not many, still early access, but they are quite fun. You have many obstacles as some berry like creatures to chase and eat you, exploding crates which you can use to blow the enemy, power ups, hot streams which shoot you up, similar to jumps on quake 3 which makes game pretty fun.\n\nDeathmatch is fun, because of the neutral enemies, those are quite nasty and hard to run from, but they gives you points too, so if you are having skills, you can win the game counting on them.\n\nCapture the flag, there you have yuge robot to control which helps you to support the team or guard your flag, you have speed ups many places to barricade yourself  and guard, many place to stuck enemy into a trap between exploding crates.\n\nTeam Deathmatch, again differs from usual gameplay, you should just check the game and see that it looks more fun than the videos.\n\nWhat is expected.\nAs far as i know new classes, maps, customizations and friend invitations are planned. So I'm expecting good stuff from the game now.\n\nBad things here.\nThe only drawbacks, the game crashes at me somehow before joining, happened several times. No clan-tags and avatar support and nothing was mentioned for those. Needs more perks, double damage, double health, etc, which will really make the gameplay more intensive.\nNo LAN support or dedicated server announced.\n\nPay to play - pay to win?\nNah, the game at it's current stage is free to play and has no microtrasactions, they stated that they are planning to add payment methods and I hope that will not overpower some players compared to another when product is finished in the future, because it will disbalance it greatly which is not cool thing for shooter.\n\nGameplay goes well!\nThe game plays smooth, characters are not lagging out or glitching into objects despite the edgy areas, it has nice dynamics, movements are good, aiming is very nicely done. Sometimes it takes quite much of skills to bring down your enemy as they dodges your shooting pretty good too.\nThe only thing that nagged me about shooting from higher place is that your shooting hits the ground so you should expose yourself from your cover to kill someone, still that is not something bad, you should just pay more caution on your cover then.\n\nI recommend the game, especially because lack of pay to joy, it is pretty fun in the current state and I really hope they to keep it that way.\n\n","September 15, 2014","true","1.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game is fun to play but there are big balancing issues such as team balancing (once I was on a game that was 3 against 6) and also only 2 of the 3 classes are actualy useful. The game features a system where you can get items to decorate you character by unlocking crates. You get keys by getting XP and sometimes when you kill some one they drop a crate. If the game cost money, than I would tell you to stay away from it, but it's fun enough to be acceptable as a REAL F2P game with no microtransactions for once.","November 23, 2014","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has so much potential and I think it can live up to its potential with a little more things added.\n\nSuch as\n\n-More classes (maybe a Wolf?Or human)\n-Add a small story (Like insects vs mammals? Would be cool to play as a giant spider or bee)\n-More weapons and meele weapons for different classes.\n-Promote it more\n-Add more dlcs\n-Make the enviroment more active. Like if it was insects vs mammals add like a bee hive so if a person shoots it by accident bees come out and start to damage the player, or whoever is closer to the hive gets attacked.\n\nSo many ideas you can have with this game with just more effort and dedication.\n\nGame is addictive, fun and really good.\n\nPs.

That's how terrible this game was, I was in and out in a jiffy.\nLiterally ZERO people in the servers. The only things I had my sights locked on were crates and these weird plant creatures. Yes, you have to worry about players and plants. Not like there are players around.\nNot only is there no one around, the weapons are terrible! Well, weapon cause each class only has 1 weapon!! You don't even get a knife or anything like that. You get to have equipments such as hats as design im guessing or maybe like in TF2 where it gives you bonus stats. But that's just it, you only have ONE weapon.\nI can't even rate a game that had me fighting plants the whole time and has no freaking players.\nThey should rename it to "Plant Warfare with Zero Players".\nIt is also buggy, the guns just shoot on its on without you even firing.\n\nWell, I thought the game was good enough since at first look it got me to try it out. Controls are basic, WASD, LMB, RMB, Spacebar, Tab for scoreboard.The character designs are good. Maps are meh.

The game is fun to play but there are big balancing issues such as team balancing (once I was on a game that was 3 against 6) and also only 2 of the 3 classes are actualy useful. The game features a system where you can get items to decorate you character by unlocking crates. You get keys by getting XP and sometimes when you kill some one they drop a crate.

One which said something about if you think this game is for kids and cute animals they were saying you are wrong.... really? How many games has that person even played? All this game is, is something that wants to be the new TF2. That's what this game feels like. As if all it wants to be is the new TF2. Why am I recommending it with a thumbs up? It's not invalid for what it advertises itself to be. It's a shooting game. A bunch of animals running around. It is what it offers. If you go into this game expecting anything else... well. that's on you. Do I believe it is worth spending my time on? No, not really. It reminds me of that older game with the same concept, called small arms I think it was. This game itself be it in early access or not. It's not bad, it's not good. It's just little animal figures running around shooting.... With toon like level graphics in a way. If you are into that sort of thing. Then you should like this. If you want some hardcore FPS with tiny cute animal slaughter... This isn't that. The game is legit for what it advertises.

That lofty goal is however still aways off.  What you'll find at this early stage in development is some fairly crude stuff.  Notwithstanding, I've had fun with what I've played.\n\nAs with every Early Access game, however, what you're paying for is potential (paying if you buy the DLC, that is).  Right now I have to ask myself whether the devs aren't perhaps wasting a lot of effort with this game.  After all, we already have Team Fortress 2.  Why do a clone?  I would suppose the simplest answer to this question being -- why not do a clone?  If one thing is successful, does that presuppose that someone else shouldn't try to do the same thing and try to beat the original at its own game?  I mean, that's the core of virtually all business, isn't it?  All businesses try to do something better which others are already doing.\n\nSince this is Early Access, prepare for some rough patches, including:\n\n- few players\n- few maps\n- maps are overly simplistic, crude and small\n- general lack of detail (and personality) with regards to character models\n- low resolution textures\n- gun models take up far too much visual space, blocking your view\n- only three playable classes\n- and they are horribly unbalanced\n- stock music which doesn't fit the theme or the action\n\nRight now, during Winter Sale 2014, the DLC pack is €0,41.  I've decided to buy a few and hand them out to friends to try and get the community going.  If the developers buck the Early Access trend and actually make this into a game worth playing, i.e. a product that rivals Team Fortress 2 for its polish and accessibility (while embracing the competitive edge lacking in TF2's model), then we'll be on to a winner.\n\nIn my opinion, there is a market for a competitive FPS starring cutesy animals wielding big guns (provided the guns don't block half the screen).  Now let's hope Hyper Hippo Prods. don't screw up their particular stab at that market.\n","December 21, 2014","true","4.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But things have changed quite a bit recently.\n\nLet's start off with a history lesson. Wild Warfare started off as a game called Mech Mice Academy (MMA). It was an interesting little FPS built off of a modded engine. As the game developed, more people started playing. But then something happened. The game went on kickstarter and transitioned into Wild Warfare. It launched on Steam Greenlight and then eventually released on steam. However, some of the MMA players didn't like the transition to Wild Warfare and left.\n\nThe player base has been very erratic over the past few months. Shortly after the game launched on Steam, there were 105 people playing this game at once. Since then, it has decreased. 105 was the most ever Steam players at one time Wild Warfare has ever seen, which is very sad, since this game had and still possibly has so much potential. The community is so small now that the developers have recently removed the server selection option to keep all the players together on the same servers. Sometimes this makes it very difficult to be on the same game as your friends.\n\nThere is no matchmaking whatsoever, which is a pro and a con at the same time. The pro: Since the community is so small, it helps keep the servers filled up. The con: You could be a level 1 playing on a server with 3 level 50s. There is a HUGE gap in the skill of players right now. Most players are either a complete noob or extremely skilled.\n\nI was informed recently that the developers are putting this game off to the side and we will recieve few, if any, updates unless more people start playing. Realistically, I doubt that this is going to happen. The player base has been dwindling at about the same rate it is growing, sometimes going up and sometimes going down. Sadly, the general trend of the player base is down. However, putting this game to the side is just going to kill it. Only the games that recieve regular patches keep a consistent player base. If the game isn't dead now, it's gonna be soon.\n\nThe direction Wild Warfare has gone is very sad, since it could have been real good. Maybe even the best. But as much as I like this game and continue to play it, I simply can't recommend it to new players. Not in its current state.","September 22, 2014","false","130.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

One is where when you shoot your gun it doesn't stop shooting until you purposely shoot again. The second one is that whenever one would  go to my loadout and head back to the main menu and can never get out of the racoon head spinning around loading sequence. Another thing would be to add more classes to the game or weapons. Maybe give the striker a sniper or add a new sniper class.It would also be good if you could add in a text option , but thats not really important.  It would also be nice to be able to choose what game mode you want. Anyways , the game itselfg has a pretty fun environmentg and the games are really fun to play.

This is an incredibly fun, addicting, and hilarious arena style first person shooter. Each animal is essentially a different class, the bear is a big lumbering enemy and has a heavy machine gun and lots of health. The raccoon (my personal favorite) is pretty quick and has a 3-shot burst rifle and half of the bear's health. The bunny (which is terrifying to run into) is the fastest of the classes, can double jump, has the least health, and is melee only. The classes play off one another really well and feel very balanced, the maps are well designed, movement and combat are very slick and feel very smooth... But now I have to talk about that asterisk.\n\nGetting into a game is next to impossible, you need to have friends who will buy and play this game with you or else you're going to have a tough time. Not only that, but my friends and I had issues joining the only server with players on it because every time we would try our games would freeze and crash. The game feels pretty bare-bones at this point in development, and if nothing else is done with it I find it kind of hard to recommend. However, if the developers keep on working on the game and actually finish it then I can't recommend the game enough. This game has insane potential, it's just good old fashioned FUN with a competitive edge.\n\nAnd a message to the developers, the game's options menu is kind of... Unfortunate. Particularly in the audio department. Rather than having an on/off switch for the in game sounds and music, a slider for each should be implemented. I loved playing with music, but when I had it on it was too loud for me to hear my friends so I had to turn it off.\n\nTL;DR - Very fun game, needs some work.","August 13, 2014","true","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

What does that mean?\n\nIt means that the premise is pretty solid: cartoony animals duke it out shooter style, with each animal being it's own class and filling certain niches on the team. There's even a big mech already, so that's good. And the guns looks more or elss like Nerf guns, which is the kind of hi-tech blocky look I can get behind. :)\n\nThe down side is, there are only three classes... and each class has exactly 1 weapon. Slow heavy badger(?) with a chaingun, middle-speed average-sized raccoon with a 3-round-burst rifle, and a rabbit with a wrench (he is called the engineer, but cannot build or repair things that I know of). So, the makings of some good class warfare here, but there are not yet enough thigns to differeniant them.\n\nPotential, though. Lots of that! You can already imagine in your mind what future classes they might add, and it's not as if there is a lack of inspiration for extra gear. There is a crate system, which as far as I can tell, is cosmetic-only items and I don't believe you can buy them: crates drop from players, and keys are given as you rank up (I could be mistaken, but that's where it seems to be right now, which is good).\n\nSo hey, this is a free-to-play early access game. That means you won't pay anything but your trime to give this a download and shoot some stuff up. I think that this game is worth following, as it has the potential to shape up into something really fun and relatively unique in the world of shooters. :)\n\nEdit: Commented on the aesthetics of the guns (I like it).","September 28, 2014","true","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I never really played TF2 so I have no say in what people are saying about the comparison of these games, but nonetheless Wild Warfare is a really fun game for being a free to play.  Although I do wish the fanbase would grow more there are a few flaws.\n\n\nThere are only 3 player classes, but on the wiki it states that there will be a few added in when the game is finished.\nDuring Snail Hunter mode, if you happen to fall into the lava from where the snail is (which should honestly be moved) then the snail remains in the lava and nobody can get to it until it respawns.\nGun sprites take up WAY too much of the screen and the heavy even blocks almost the whole left side.\nThe classes are way unbalanced which should be fixed.\n\n\nI really hope they finish making this game because it could turn out really well if they play their cards right.","April 25, 2015","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Nonetheless, here is a quick review, with alternating pros and cons.\n\n+Animals are pretty cute\n- Only play mode is quick match, throwing you in a random map with random players.\n+ Play modes are easy to understand: Capture the flag (with mechs!), team deathmatch, free for all deathmatch, and keepaway (with a snail!)\n+ Hats! Also warpaint, backpacks, armor, boots, etc.\n- The engineer class is awful. 3 heath and only melee attacks. The striker class is broken because nothing can hit it. I can 1v5 a team deathmatch as striker and win easily.\n+The announcer says "Cheese and crackers!" when you are dominating\n\nThis game is fun for a little while, but considering I can wear a monacle and snail backpack and still not play with friends (except for slowly cycling through quick match servers), it's questionable what development priorities are. Hopefully more functionality will come in the future, but as of now this game isn't worth too much of your time.\n\nThen again, I'll probably still play this somewhat frequently, as the gameplay that exists IS fun. Seriously, just try it since it's free.","February 8, 2015","true","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But things have changed quite a bit recently.\n\nLet's start off with a history lesson. Wild Warfare started off as a game called Mech Mice Academy (MMA). It was an interesting little FPS built off of a modded engine. As the game developed, more people started playing. But then something happened. The game went on kickstarter and transitioned into Wild Warfare. It launched on Steam Greenlight and then eventually released on steam. However, some of the MMA players didn't like the transition to Wild Warfare and left.\n\nThe player base has been very erratic over the past few months. Shortly after the game launched on Steam, there were 105 people playing this game at once. Since then, it has decreased. 105 was the most ever Steam players at one time Wild Warfare has ever seen, which is very sad, since this game had and still possibly has so much potential. The community is so small now that the developers have recently removed the server selection option to keep all the players together on the same servers. Sometimes this makes it very difficult to be on the same game as your friends.\n\nThere is no matchmaking whatsoever, which is a pro and a con at the same time. The pro: Since the community is so small, it helps keep the servers filled up. The con: You could be a level 1 playing on a server with 3 level 50s. There is a HUGE gap in the skill of players right now. Most players are either a complete noob or extremely skilled.\n\nI was informed recently that the developers are putting this game off to the side and we will recieve few, if any, updates unless more people start playing. Realistically, I doubt that this is going to happen. The player base has been dwindling at about the same rate it is growing, sometimes going up and sometimes going down. Sadly, the general trend of the player base is down. However, putting this game to the side is just going to kill it. Only the games that recieve regular patches keep a consistent player base. If the game isn't dead now, it's gonna be soon.\n\nThe direction Wild Warfare has gone is very sad, since it could have been real good. Maybe even the best. But as much as I like this game and continue to play it, I simply can't recommend it to new players. Not in its current state.","September 22, 2014","false","130.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has so much potential and I think it can live up to its potential with a little more things added.\n\nSuch as\n\n-More classes (maybe a Wolf?Or human)\n-Add a small story (Like insects vs mammals? Would be cool to play as a giant spider or bee)\n-More weapons and meele weapons for different classes.\n-Promote it more\n-Add more dlcs\n-Make the enviroment more active. Like if it was insects vs mammals add like a bee hive so if a person shoots it by accident bees come out and start to damage the player, or whoever is closer to the hive gets attacked.\n\nSo many ideas you can have with this game with just more effort and dedication.\n\nGame is addictive, fun and really good.\n\nPs. Love what you did with the plants, their the best friends and worse enemies of the game.","December 14, 2014","true","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game is fun to play but there are big balancing issues such as team balancing (once I was on a game that was 3 against 6) and also only 2 of the 3 classes are actualy useful. The game features a system where you can get items to decorate you character by unlocking crates. You get keys by getting XP and sometimes when you kill some one they drop a crate. If the game cost money, than I would tell you to stay away from it, but it's fun enough to be acceptable as a REAL F2P game with no microtransactions for once.","November 23, 2014","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LandScrape/recommended/312150/","LandScrape","LandScrape™","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LandScrape/","53 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nIf you would have asked me a while ago, I would have recommended Wild Warfare without hesitation. But things have changed quite a bit recently.\n\nLet's start off with a history lesson. Wild Warfare started off as a game called Mech Mice Academy (MMA). It was an interesting little FPS built off of a modded engine. As the game developed, more people started playing. But then something happened. The game went on kickstarter and transitioned into Wild Warfare. It launched on Steam Greenlight and then eventually released on steam. However, some of the MMA players didn't like the transition to Wild Warfare and left.\n\nThe player base has been very erratic over the past few months. Shortly after the game launched on Steam, there were 105 people playing this game at once. Since then, it has decreased. 105 was the most ever Steam players at one time Wild Warfare has ever seen, which is very sad, since this game had and still possibly has so much potential. The community is so small now that the developers have recently removed the server selection option to keep all the players together on the same servers. Sometimes this makes it very difficult to be on the same game as your friends.\n\nThere is no matchmaking whatsoever, which is a pro and a con at the same time. The pro: Since the community is so small, it helps keep the servers filled up. The con: You could be a level 1 playing on a server with 3 level 50s. There is a HUGE gap in the skill of players right now. Most players are either a complete noob or extremely skilled.\n\nI was informed recently that the developers are putting this game off to the side and we will recieve few, if any, updates unless more people start playing. Realistically, I doubt that this is going to happen. The player base has been dwindling at about the same rate it is growing, sometimes going up and sometimes going down. Sadly, the general trend of the player base is down. However, putting this game to the side is just going to kill it. Only the games that recieve regular patches keep a consistent player base. If the game isn't dead now, it's gonna be soon.\n\nThe direction Wild Warfare has gone is very sad, since it could have been real good. Maybe even the best. But as much as I like this game and continue to play it, I simply can't recommend it to new players. Not in its current state.","September 22, 2014","false","130.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Animals shooting each other\n2.  Some good maps\n3. When everyone  dose not out number another team\n4. Two good classes\n\nWHY IT"S NOT FUN.\n\n1. TO MANY PLAYERS USING THE AUTO FIRE GLITCH FOR THE STIKER (who can only do three round brust not full auto)\n2. Players floating in the air at times\n3. Some players seem to have way more HP then the class should (how do I know maybe cause I shoot them in the back like 15 times an they are still alive)\n4. Players seem to lag switch  ( if you dont know what that is it's when a bad player lags them selves so it looks like they  are in one spot when they are not)\n5. THE ENGINEER  this class is down right  cheap I.E. they can leave the map to hide  from those using guns  like in snail hunt  at times they can hit you when they are not even close to you.    I THINK THIS CLASS SHOULD BE REMOVED  Or this the double jump so have a cool down for them.\n6.  At times it seems players are using a auto aim bot  on you\n\nit's not a bad game an it is fun when player dont   cheat  using the glitches  as if you have to cheat in a PVP  game it just proves to me an other how bad you  really are at games","August 3, 2014","true","33.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

With aspects similar to tf2 and a REALLY good soundtrack, this game currently has me at a love hate relationship with it. You get to choose to play as the Striker ( an assault rifle toting racoon (guardians of the galaxy, anyone??)), a heavy (well... the heavy.) and the engineer (a bunny that runs around whacking people with a wrench, so demoknight...?) Anyway, the combat is surprisingly fun, and the fighting seems balanced. The only thing that makes this game bad is the fact that players who make use of the bunny hop (and some people LITERALLY doing the bunny hop as a bunny) make the combat seem broken, and some aspects of the game like opening crates or trying to get into that amazing looking Titanfall mech are just broken. Other than that, this game is pretty good and should, as always, only be played by people who are used to early access.","September 6, 2014","true","3.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Yes, you have to worry about players and plants. Not like there are players around.\nNot only is there no one around, the weapons are terrible! Well, weapon cause each class only has 1 weapon!! You don't even get a knife or anything like that. You get to have equipments such as hats as design im guessing or maybe like in TF2 where it gives you bonus stats. But that's just it, you only have ONE weapon.\nI can't even rate a game that had me fighting plants the whole time and has no freaking players.\nThey should rename it to "Plant Warfare with Zero Players".\nIt is also buggy, the guns just shoot on its on without you even firing.\n\nWell, I thought the game was good enough since at first look it got me to try it out.

Like TF2 dumbed down, basically. Each class has one weapon, raccoon 'striker' shoots 3 shots 1 damage each and can aim down sights 4 hp, rabbit 'engineer' has a wrench and whacks people with it for 2 damage each and has 3 hp may or may not run fast, bear 'heavy' that has a minigun that can overheat with bullets that deal 1 damage each moves slowly and has 8 hp.\n\nThere are different modes but you can't mode select, it choses for you. FFA, team deathmatch, and capture the flag from what I saw. Vehicles are 'level locked' which basically means if you didn't play enough matches before entering the match with a vehicle you can't use it. The game feels floaty, I could barely hit someone going up a ramp in a straight line.\n\nIn the capture the flag mode, people can pick up a speed power up before picking the flag up to get it away faster, but not with the flag equipped. You can't drop things either, as far as I can tell from the 'rebindable keys.' There is no chat, may have removed it? In FFA mode there was a snail I picked up as far as I could tell did nothing, and since I couldn't drop it, I threw myself into the lava.\n\nThe AI in the game is dumb, and if you sneak up behind them you have a 50 50 they won't turn around and attack you back, but since most of this game is killing people by sneaking up behind them (3 shot burst for quick kill as a striker, hitting them with the wrench as the bunny, doing a quick gun down as a heavy) there's rarely a time to pick a fair fight by going up in front about it due to low HP and high damage.\n\nThe only redeeming factor I could see is the cosmetics, which you randomly got per level some keys to open crates that dropped from enemies. I didn't see a cash shop other than the DLC they had on the store, which wasn't too highly priced either. I guess the main reason this hasn't been updated in 2 years is due to no money and being FTP, but still isn't worth playing imo.","February 22, 2015","false","0.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Probably one of the most fun first person shooter games i have played in a while. This game is great and all. . .but the resent changes that came this year caused more problems. I stopped playing for a while and will jump right back at the update to see if it is getting better.\n\nHowever this game is early access and although I might not agree with some of the updates put out so far, I beleive the game has great potential in the future.\n\nPros:\n- Fun gameplay that you can play for hours.\n- They got rid of the shrubs\n- Animals are awesome, adding guns. . . even better.\n- Different game modes\n- I have only seen one or two bugs, but they were fixed.\n- Not pay to win. (nothing to pay just have fun :) )\n- Nice Staff\n- Has the 3 essential classes in any fps, a rusher, defender, and a attacker. More is to come though :) .\nCons:\n- Hard to figure out chat after update , (I might be wrong I just havent found it)\n- Bright yellow light when picking up speed boots in CTF might give people headaches after a hour or two. (just my personal experience even on lowest brightness setting)\n- Not that big of a player base, (This can change #downloadwildwarfarenow or die)\n- Only a quickplay button, (They used to have a server list but this was a fix so we can get full games.)\n\nI know this game is early access and has its flaws, but it truly is the funnest FPS i have palyed in a long time. I would easily put in as much time i have spent playing other fps games on here once there is a update. Until then we just have to wait. As much as i love this game we just have to wait.\n\nThank you devlopers for giving me the most fun i have had in a while but maybe you can rethink some of the character updates that was put in to the game :).\n\nMy personal rating : 8/10 Even though i might not agree fully with some of the updates I know they have something greater in store for us :D.\n\nP.S. The gold guns are boss but we cant use them in team games only free for all modes <3.\nP.P.S.

Players participate in team-based objectives and large maps, with multiple game modes and a different animal for every class type.\n\nThis game is a diamond in the rough that REALLY shines. It could do with a few more updates like new maps, gamemodes and maybe characters even though they are pretty perfect already. They are well balanced and each have their strong suits. The customization options are absolutely brilliant. Facepaint, bow ties, top hats and many more and they're pretty easy to unlock to! Wild Warfare isn't without flaws, (which game isn't?) but the satisfaction of killing another player is immense and pays off really well. It nails that one more go feeling and can get quite intense in certain gamemodes.\nTalking about gamemodes, some of them could be improved. The worst is the Snail Gamemode where a player can collect the snail which gives them one point per second. This can be quite an annoying mode because people always win by a landslide. So watch out for that.\n\nOverall this unusual and unique FPS game is a great game to spice up your free time. It's nowhere near a P2W either. You'll be on the edge of your seats in the intense battles. What are you waiting for? Go download that game!\n\n(╯°□°)╯   9/10","August 1, 2015","true","3.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I did however have one problem when i first downloaded it, It connected me as a recruit rather than my steam name and when i left i lost all my stuff.. I reinstalled it and now it works. I join back and have all my stuff... So dispite the bug that happened when i first installed it, it's worth a try, Due to it being early access not many people play it, and it's sad because this game has alot of potential. Give it a try. You won't regret it.","June 23, 2015","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Add a balance to any new weapons; think of Team Fortress 2.)\n-Only three classes\n-The Engineer is more of a Scout than an engineer (Just cause he has a wrench doesn't mean he's an Engy)\n\n\nIt's... OK for what it is. It can be glitchy and boring, but the concept could have been okay and the game still ahs its moments.  Looking at some of the original WW images, it looks like it's gotten worse since the 'Spring Cleaning' update (When I started playing).\nI advise you wait a few months and see where it goes before downloading (That is, if it actually goes anywhere)","June 8, 2015","false","5.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The rabbit is so useless. As far as I have played, I can't even figure out if I can choose a different gun or build something.\n\nNodody plays the game at all. I went on an official server and only 6 PEOPLE were on there.\n\nHowever, Team Fortress 2 is an excellent game.

A lot of the time there aren't even any other players on the server you get sent to.\n\nIt definitely needs to have some kinks worked out, but at the same time the more people play the less of an issue theese things are.

The content is too bare to really call it a game. Thankfully it is free to play, otherwise I would've just dismissed this game and called it a waste of money. Instead, I see it as a waste of time. There is very little content in this game, and it's in very early alpha. I find it a poor choice to release a public access to such a tile that has yet to offer anything really meaningful.\n\nThe combat is boring and has an identity crisis of what it truly wants to be. It's part Quake/Unreal Tournament, part Class-based warfare, but it doesn't do justice to either of the two. It isn't as fast based as Quake/Unreal Tournament and it doesn't offer enough diversity between the 3 current classes to really feel like a new experience each time you select a class.\n\nThe map design is plain and offers the basic jump-pads of an arena style shooter, as well as the med-kits. However, it lacks any extra weapons to pick up so you are stuck with the only weapon your class possesses.\n\nI would like to see this game evolve into something greater, but as it stands now, it isn't even worth the download.","January 7, 2015","false","0.2"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

The game is fun to play but there are big balancing issues such as team balancing (once I was on a game that was 3 against 6) and also only 2 of the 3 classes are actualy useful. The game features a system where you can get items to decorate you character by unlocking crates. You get keys by getting XP and sometimes when you kill some one they drop a crate. If the game cost money, than I would tell you to stay away from it, but it's fun enough to be acceptable as a REAL F2P game with no microtransactions for once.","November 23, 2014","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That's how terrible this game was, I was in and out in a jiffy.\nLiterally ZERO people in the servers. The only things I had my sights locked on were crates and these weird plant creatures. Yes, you have to worry about players and plants. Not like there are players around.\nNot only is there no one around, the weapons are terrible! Well, weapon cause each class only has 1 weapon!! You don't even get a knife or anything like that. You get to have equipments such as hats as design im guessing or maybe like in TF2 where it gives you bonus stats. But that's just it, you only have ONE weapon.\nI can't even rate a game that had me fighting plants the whole time and has no freaking players.\nThey should rename it to "Plant Warfare with Zero Players".\nIt is also buggy, the guns just shoot on its on without you even firing.\n\nWell, I thought the game was good enough since at first look it got me to try it out. Controls are basic, WASD, LMB, RMB, Spacebar, Tab for scoreboard.The character designs are good. Maps are meh. Again, all pointless if there is no one to play against.","November 26, 2014","false","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Nonetheless, here is a quick review, with alternating pros and cons.\n\n+Animals are pretty cute\n- Only play mode is quick match, throwing you in a random map with random players.\n+ Play modes are easy to understand: Capture the flag (with mechs!), team deathmatch, free for all deathmatch, and keepaway (with a snail!)\n+ Hats! Also warpaint, backpacks, armor, boots, etc.\n- The engineer class is awful. 3 heath and only melee attacks. The striker class is broken because nothing can hit it. I can 1v5 a team deathmatch as striker and win easily.\n+The announcer says "Cheese and crackers!" when you are dominating\n\nThis game is fun for a little while, but considering I can wear a monacle and snail backpack and still not play with friends (except for slowly cycling through quick match servers), it's questionable what development priorities are. Hopefully more functionality will come in the future, but as of now this game isn't worth too much of your time.\n\nThen again, I'll probably still play this somewhat frequently, as the gameplay that exists IS fun. Seriously, just try it since it's free.","February 8, 2015","true","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The characters and ideas are all there, it just needs additions and refining for it become a great free to play title.\n\nFirstly, more weapons for each classes, I'm thinking a melee and long range weapon for each class at least. Just feels that each class is lacking, and doesnt have enough varity in gameplay.\n\nSecondly like the first, more classes. The game needs more varity, and having more additional classes will benifit the game greatly.\n\nFinally, new modes and improved animations. There is only a small amount of modes available right now, I would think some more which feel different, many a coop mode as well.

This game is all you can want in a game. Unlike other FPS games I play, this game has a rankup system. It is balanced so that the better you are, the higher you get. It doesn't matter who you are playing as long as you are better, or if you arent, can practice to get better. This silly game is actually very fun and addicting. To be honest, I know some people that have parents in which do not allow them to play M rated games such as most FPS games. This game doesn't have any factors that would make this game really that violent. Basically what I'm trying to say is that this game is incredible and enjoyable not to mention addicting, and is the perfect pick for those seeking another free FPS game. I do want to mention that I do not like the lack of players. If this game were much more popular this game would be epic. Some people have been claiming about bugs, but as far as i'm concerned, there really arent many. I do want to mention that if you are a fan of Team Fortress 2, take the 3 classes and match them with this:\n- Striker: Basically Scout - Runs Fast has a good gun\n- Heavy: Heavy from TF2 - Runs slowly with heavy weapon and is very fat\n- Engineer: Engineer from TF2 - Runs moderate speed although can't build sentries or anything - just carries a wrench\nBasically, if you are used to the gameplay of TF2, this game should be an easy adaptation. One other thing is that the gamemodes are sometimes too short to do what you want. I would much enjoy it if the folks at Hyper Hippo would make CTF maybe a round based game instead of a time based game. Same with Snail Hunter. One other thing is that you should consider the $4.99 DLC pack for this game to get you some cool cosmetics to make you look like a true Wild Warfare MLG Pro. Bottom line is, this is a great free to play FPS game that i'm sure you'll probably enjoy playing with other people on the game, and your friends!

This is part of a game's "feel" which is something that the devs should probably look a bit into.\n- The snail: In one map, (that was actually a pretty nice map, with a lot of verticallity and unique ideas) there was a snail, in the middle of the map- it was an item of some sort. And even though, if you check by pressing tab, holding the snail gives you points, the game tells you nothing about that. How am I supposed to play without a goal? also, you can't drop the damn snail :c\n- Class swapping is not immediate in your team's base.\n- Shooting sounds too repetitive-Note to devs: since I know this game is developed in Unity, or can assume so because of the launch screen, try to randomize the pitch a very slight bit, perhaps.\n- Shooting sounds are also too loud when a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of people are shooting\n- Some maps allow people to camp from spawn, in capture the flag game mode :/ which is pretty annoying\n- Geysers/Launch pads don't show the direction in which they'll launch you.\n- Couldn't enter mech because I was a bunny? that's racist brah\n- Also 2 out of 3 of the classes really seem like they are from TF2, but they work well so it's OK.\n- I haven't gotten any crates yet, which feels not that rewarding. Perhaps the crate system is uncomplete though.\n\nHowever, there are certain stuff that I liked:\n\n+ Has few classes that can be focused, unlike similar class-based-shooters.\n+ classes seem to be pretty balanced.\n+ fights are pretty fun, even though shooting is slightly feedbackless.\n+ Dem graphics\n+ Some maps are designed really well in my opinion (some aren't).\n+ No sprinting- which is unique and so far, I like it (even though I wouldn't want people to not be able to sprint in every game)\n\nSo, overall, I'd wait for the game to fix some bugs and actually feel somewhat more finished before playing it.\nHowever, I do think it has potential to be a pretty fun game to play- I could totally see me and a bunch of friends playing this together sometime.\n","May 24","false","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is part of a game's "feel" which is something that the devs should probably look a bit into.\n- The snail: In one map, (that was actually a pretty nice map, with a lot of verticallity and unique ideas) there was a snail, in the middle of the map- it was an item of some sort. And even though, if you check by pressing tab, holding the snail gives you points, the game tells you nothing about that. How am I supposed to play without a goal? also, you can't drop the damn snail :c\n- Class swapping is not immediate in your team's base.\n- Shooting sounds too repetitive-Note to devs: since I know this game is developed in Unity, or can assume so because of the launch screen, try to randomize the pitch a very slight bit, perhaps.\n- Shooting sounds are also too loud when a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of people are shooting\n- Some maps allow people to camp from spawn, in capture the flag game mode :/ which is pretty annoying\n- Geysers/Launch pads don't show the direction in which they'll launch you.\n- Couldn't enter mech because I was a bunny? that's racist brah\n- Also 2 out of 3 of the classes really seem like they are from TF2, but they work well so it's OK.\n- I haven't gotten any crates yet, which feels not that rewarding. Perhaps the crate system is uncomplete though.\n\nHowever, there are certain stuff that I liked:\n\n+ Has few classes that can be focused, unlike similar class-based-shooters.\n+ classes seem to be pretty balanced.\n+ fights are pretty fun, even though shooting is slightly feedbackless.\n+ Dem graphics\n+ Some maps are designed really well in my opinion (some aren't).\n+ No sprinting- which is unique and so far, I like it (even though I wouldn't want people to not be able to sprint in every game)\n\nSo, overall, I'd wait for the game to fix some bugs and actually feel somewhat more finished before playing it.\nHowever, I do think it has potential to be a pretty fun game to play- I could totally see me and a bunch of friends playing this together sometime.\n","May 24","false","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If this is showing a more in-depth version of the game available for pre-purchase (it's not now but at some point I assume it was) then it should be much longer to make it worthwhile. Otherwise, it should just be called a demo. It would be cool if there were a story mode where you actually get to go to new maps after you reach a certain level. It's nice for a free game, but this has been in Early Access for a while so there's no telling if work on this game will ever be resumed, but it's certainly something I'd put my money towards once finished.","June 5","true","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But only since I assume this is a very early stage in the provess. Allot of Textures need to be reworked. I mean they don't need to be necesarrily look more realistic but they don't fit the stile as well. There is also the lack of a practice mode and the controlling is more like an early FPS, but nether the less it is rock solid. I hope for far more characters. Expecially there should be a fox. Maybe a Badger or maybe something more Interesting like a snake or something. Well they have a Raccoon in it, whish proofs that this game is badass.^^ The music so far is great. First I thought it was okay but now I whish I had the soundtrack because it is kickass and I really love the style. So far I love the character costumization level. More than hats that is for sure. I gues that will solve as money maker when the game will arrive.\n\nI know there are allot better shooter out there but no Furry shooter.

I played for about 20 minutes, and enjoyed the experience thoroughly. However, there were perhaps 4 people total online, throughout the world, which was kind of disappointing.

But only since I assume this is a very early stage in the provess. Allot of Textures need to be reworked. I mean they don't need to be necesarrily look more realistic but they don't fit the stile as well. There is also the lack of a practice mode and the controlling is more like an early FPS, but nether the less it is rock solid. I hope for far more characters. Expecially there should be a fox. Maybe a Badger or maybe something more Interesting like a snake or something. Well they have a Raccoon in it, whish proofs that this game is badass.^^ The music so far is great. First I thought it was okay but now I whish I had the soundtrack because it is kickass and I really love the style. So far I love the character costumization level. More than hats that is for sure. I gues that will solve as money maker when the game will arrive.\n\nI know there are allot better shooter out there but no Furry shooter. I mean not even TF2 has some decent furry mods, and not so animal furry characters like them. I will recomend that to all my furry and non furry friends, because it is something.","September 28, 2014","true","4.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The weapons feel nice, the maps are pretty cool, and there's a few fun gamemodes to play on.  You're always getting new stuff thanks to the crates that occasionally drop from players (you only get cosmetics, though). However, the AI opponents that fill some lobbies are either incredibly stupid or way too hard (as in, teleport to your location hard).

The game is fun to play but there are big balancing issues such as team balancing (once I was on a game that was 3 against 6) and also only 2 of the 3 classes are actualy useful. The game features a system where you can get items to decorate you character by unlocking crates. You get keys by getting XP and sometimes when you kill some one they drop a crate. If the game cost money, than I would tell you to stay away from it, but it's fun enough to be acceptable as a REAL F2P game with no microtransactions for once.","November 23, 2014","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

One is where when you shoot your gun it doesn't stop shooting until you purposely shoot again. The second one is that whenever one would  go to my loadout and head back to the main menu and can never get out of the racoon head spinning around loading sequence. Another thing would be to add more classes to the game or weapons. Maybe give the striker a sniper or add a new sniper class.It would also be good if you could add in a text option , but thats not really important.  It would also be nice to be able to choose what game mode you want. Anyways , the game itselfg has a pretty fun environmentg and the games are really fun to play. The game is really fun so far!","March 12, 2015","true","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I never really played TF2 so I have no say in what people are saying about the comparison of these games, but nonetheless Wild Warfare is a really fun game for being a free to play.  Although I do wish the fanbase would grow more there are a few flaws.\n\n\nThere are only 3 player classes, but on the wiki it states that there will be a few added in when the game is finished.\nDuring Snail Hunter mode, if you happen to fall into the lava from where the snail is (which should honestly be moved) then the snail remains in the lava and nobody can get to it until it respawns.\nGun sprites take up WAY too much of the screen and the heavy even blocks almost the whole left side.\nThe classes are way unbalanced which should be fixed.\n\n\nI really hope they finish making this game because it could turn out really well if they play their cards right.","April 25, 2015","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Its not high tech, bug free, amazing maps, or tons of players yet. It does download fast and occasionally is super fun for about 20-30 minutes at a time. Also you can get crate drops for free and keys in game to open stuff and get new visuals. I just got a new cute little boater, and a hat that is a weapon crate so now my head is a box.

Not to mention that not many people play, so it's not unusual for you to find the game literaly empty.\nWell, it's to be expected since it's on "early access", right?\nWrong. It has been on "early access" for a long time now.\nThe game is dead, and the developers simply forgot about it. This is not a "developers take to long to update", no.

But only since I assume this is a very early stage in the provess. Allot of Textures need to be reworked. I mean they don't need to be necesarrily look more realistic but they don't fit the stile as well. There is also the lack of a practice mode and the controlling is more like an early FPS, but nether the less it is rock solid. I hope for far more characters. Expecially there should be a fox. Maybe a Badger or maybe something more Interesting like a snake or something. Well they have a Raccoon in it, whish proofs that this game is badass.^^ The music so far is great. First I thought it was okay but now I whish I had the soundtrack because it is kickass and I really love the style. So far I love the character costumization level. More than hats that is for sure. I gues that will solve as money maker when the game will arrive.\n\nI know there are allot better shooter out there but no Furry shooter. I mean not even TF2 has some decent furry mods, and not so animal furry characters like them. I will recomend that to all my furry and non furry friends, because it is something.","September 28, 2014","true","4.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Seriously. Everything about this game is actually amazing. It is such a blanaced game too! There are three classes. A raccoon, a rabbit, and a bear. The raccoon has a rifle and mid hp. The bear has a minigun and his slow with high hp. The rabbit has a wrench and is fast and has the lowest hp. Each hit reduces 1 hp. That may sound crazy but the characters have low hp. The rabbit has 3, the raccoon has four, and the bear has 6. That's it but it works so well. The simplicity of the game makes it much more difficult and skill based.I have only two comments for improvemnet. 1. More people need to play this game! 2.

However what I have to say isn't negative but rather some suggestions. I'm hoping they add more classes because the core 3 right now are cool but feel kinda limited with the play styles they offer. Another thing is I feel the charcters move too slow, and yes I know there is the powerup but I feel like at the speed they move normally it doesn't feel arcadey enough, to me at least.

This is part of a game's "feel" which is something that the devs should probably look a bit into.\n- The snail: In one map, (that was actually a pretty nice map, with a lot of verticallity and unique ideas) there was a snail, in the middle of the map- it was an item of some sort. And even though, if you check by pressing tab, holding the snail gives you points, the game tells you nothing about that. How am I supposed to play without a goal? also, you can't drop the damn snail :c\n- Class swapping is not immediate in your team's base.\n- Shooting sounds too repetitive-Note to devs: since I know this game is developed in Unity, or can assume so because of the launch screen, try to randomize the pitch a very slight bit, perhaps.\n- Shooting sounds are also too loud when a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of people are shooting\n- Some maps allow people to camp from spawn, in capture the flag game mode :/ which is pretty annoying\n- Geysers/Launch pads don't show the direction in which they'll launch you.\n- Couldn't enter mech because I was a bunny? that's racist brah\n- Also 2 out of 3 of the classes really seem like they are from TF2, but they work well so it's OK.\n- I haven't gotten any crates yet, which feels not that rewarding. Perhaps the crate system is uncomplete though.\n\nHowever, there are certain stuff that I liked:\n\n+ Has few classes that can be focused, unlike similar class-based-shooters.\n+ classes seem to be pretty balanced.\n+ fights are pretty fun, even though shooting is slightly feedbackless.\n+ Dem graphics\n+ Some maps are designed really well in my opinion (some aren't).\n+ No sprinting- which is unique and so far, I like it (even though I wouldn't want people to not be able to sprint in every game)\n\nSo, overall, I'd wait for the game to fix some bugs and actually feel somewhat more finished before playing it.\nHowever, I do think it has potential to be a pretty fun game to play- I could totally see me and a bunch of friends playing this together sometime.\n","May 24","false","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And even though, if you check by pressing tab, holding the snail gives you points, the game tells you nothing about that. How am I supposed to play without a goal? also, you can't drop the damn snail :c\n- Class swapping is not immediate in your team's base.\n- Shooting sounds too repetitive-Note to devs: since I know this game is developed in Unity, or can assume so because of the launch screen, try to randomize the pitch a very slight bit, perhaps.\n- Shooting sounds are also too loud when a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of people are shooting\n- Some maps allow people to camp from spawn, in capture the flag game mode :/ which is pretty annoying\n- Geysers/Launch pads don't show the direction in which they'll launch you.\n- Couldn't enter mech because I was a bunny? that's racist brah\n- Also 2 out of 3 of the classes really seem like they are from TF2, but they work well so it's OK.\n- I haven't gotten any crates yet, which feels not that rewarding. Perhaps the crate system is uncomplete though.\n\nHowever, there are certain stuff that I liked:\n\n+ Has few classes that can be focused, unlike similar class-based-shooters.\n+ classes seem to be pretty balanced.\n+ fights are pretty fun, even though shooting is slightly feedbackless.\n+ Dem graphics\n+ Some maps are designed really well in my opinion (some aren't).\n+ No sprinting- which is unique and so far, I like it (even though I wouldn't want people to not be able to sprint in every game)\n\nSo, overall, I'd wait for the game to fix some bugs and actually feel somewhat more finished before playing it.\nHowever, I do think it has potential to be a pretty fun game to play- I could totally see me and a bunch of friends playing this together sometime.\n","May 24","false","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/neenweenie/recommended/312150/","neenweenie","NeenWeenie","http://steamcommunity.com/id/neenweenie/","7 products in account","Early Access Review\n\npros:\n- really cute characters\n- casual yet competitive gameplay\n- easy to level up (I'm already level 9 after just an hour of gameplay)\n- each character has their own advantages and disadvantages\n- nice open maps\n- great graphics (played on max settings, beautiful and 1366 x 768)\n\ncons:\n- huge framerate drop/lag when too many people are shooting at once at the player\n- only 3 maps :(\n- crappy server connection system, which doesn't allow you to connect to specific friends in games\n- inconsistent server connections (after matches, my friend and I kept getting put on different servers in the same region)\n- inconsistent loading screens (after matches, you never know if you'll go back to the loadout screen or the main menu)\n- not enough U.S. players, all maps we found that were heavily populated were the EU servers\n- no chat feature in-game\n- all rounds are timed\n- no ability to set up a private server\n- quick game mode is the only playing mode\n\n\nOverall: This game is more so demo or proof of concept length than Early Access length. If this is showing a more in-depth version of the game available for pre-purchase (it's not now but at some point I assume it was) then it should be much longer to make it worthwhile. Otherwise, it should just be called a demo. It would be cool if there were a story mode where you actually get to go to new maps after you reach a certain level. It's nice for a free game, but this has been in Early Access for a while so there's no telling if work on this game will ever be resumed, but it's certainly something I'd put my money towards once finished.","June 5","true","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
