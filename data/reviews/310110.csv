"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gimmic/recommended/310110/","gimmic","{-o-} Gimmic","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gimmic/","309 products in account","BACKGROUND:\nThis game is essentially a much more polished version of the Natural Selection 1 and 2 'Combat mod', created by the same authors now under the name Faultline Games. It utilizes the engine, core gameplay elements and graphical elements of Natural Selection 2 but is not directly affiliated with Unknown Worlds. Essentially, this is a mod being sold as a standalone game at a 15$ price point. This isn't by itself a deal-breaker as long as ample content and quality is provided..\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nThe combat is fun, the leveling up elements seem well thought-out, the music is great, and the map design(albeit limited number of maps) seems to be excellent. This mod seems to 'fix' a lot of core elements of Natural Selection 2 which may have driven away more casual players. Since there's no Commander or resource metagame you're more free to play aggressively in more of an arena FPS environment. Teamplay gameplay is still rewarded but you're not entirely reliant on your team to have an enjoyable experience. I'm actually getting a lot of fun out of this fresh take on NS2 and while it does play exactly as advertised, it still feels like a mod of an existing game which I already own. With only 5 maps and the game's clearly reduced complexity compared to NS2 I am curious to see what player numbers look like in a month, or two months out.  Continual 'officially released content' will be very vital to sustaining any kind of player population.  Since this isn't a mod, the developers should not be relying on the modding community to provide for them.\n\nFaultline Games integrated a 'ranked' system for a lite form of skill-based matchmaking. You can still manually select servers but players have a skill value assigned based on their in-game performance. This is great. It allows for more intelligent team balance, if it were implemented. What's isn't great is the fact that rather than allow and enforce non-modded dedicated servers, server admins and gaming communities will be forced to rent ranked servers from a pre-selected list of server providers. No running your own (ranked) dedicated server on your own equipment. In my opinion this goes against the very roots of what makes PC gaming great.\n\nA Rock and a Hard Place:\nHad this been offered as a 5$ DLC to NS2, it would have made perfect sense. A price point of 10$ might have made more sense.  The game really is stuck between a rock and a hard place; by selling it for too little they risk not making any profit, but also since it is a stand alone game Faultline ends up alienating the existing NS2 customer base by 'making us buy NS2 again'.  Even a basic integration between the two games such as a launcher which has a server browser list that shows servers from both 'editions' would go a long way to stop this product from being such a dividing force in the NS2 community.  I know there's grand plans to continue to expand on NS2:Combat's features, effectively making it the CS:GO or 'CoD' of NS2, but currently it just isn't there yet. It would be entirely possible to put 95% of this game's content into the original NS2 as a mod.\n\nAs it stands, with zero integration to the NS2 ecosystem and at a price point more expensive than you can find the full NS2 game, I can't honestly recommend it.\n\nTLDR: What's different between this and NS2?\n1) There is NOT a commander or resource gathering metagame. There are no RTS components from NS2.\n2) There IS fast paced Human vs Alien combat set in a game with already well established abilities and technology.","October 31, 2014","false","24.6"," 591 of 718 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","591","718","0","30"

It is not the old Combat from NS1 that we all know and loved. I bought this game on a gamble becuase I figured, "how bad could it be?" Turns out I bought this just so I could tell the rest of you it's not worth it right now for this price. If it goes on sale for a noticable amount, then it might be worth something.\n\nThe only MOBA element is the fact that each team has their main HQ building and the objective is to destroy it. There are no creep waves, no item shops or items to buy. Sure you get your upgrades, but it just feels kinda shallow, like there just isnt enough variation or something in the upgrade paths you can pick.\n\nIn terms of relating this to the old NS1 combat, it simply just doesn't have the progression and variety that it had. It doesn't have the HMG, Heavy Armor, and it doesn't have the extensive amount of upgrades that Extra Levels plugin offered in the old NS1, which is what everyone used to play with. Everyone seems to forget that nobody liked the vanilla NS1 combat that came with the game, it was the Extra Levels plugin that made it more enjoyable.\n\nAnd right now, nobody plays this game. Why? Probably either becuase it just isn't fun enough to keep people interested and/or is way too pricey for the kind of game it is. Thus it probably isn't worth the price.","November 4, 2014","false","10.1"," 174 of 237 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","174","237","0","7"

Personally I don't have a problem with them charging extra for it, but that doesn't affect my review.\n\nSo here's where I'm coming from:  I've played Natural Selection since the release of the original mod for Half-Life, Combat for Natural Selection, and NS2, but not the Combat Mod for NS2.  I'll be comparing this to both NS1:Combat and NS2.\n\nMain Differences from NS2 and/or NS1:Combat:\n\nGood:\n1) No commanders.  Also in NS1:Combat, this is one of the main draws of the gametype.  You don't have to rely on anyone to get the weapons and upgrades you want.  You don't instantly lose because a first time commander is in the chair.  It sets up a more casual game that focuses on kills instead of a big strategic plan of attack.\n\n2) Buildings.  Yes, you can build stuff, unlike NS1:Combat.  A huge change.  Phase gates and Gorge tunnels help you control the map like you're playing a vanilla style NS2 game.  I like it.\n\nBad:\n1) XP Gain.  Another huge change from NS1:Combat is how hard it is to gain XP.  Leveling is much slower and gone is the "area xp" where everyone gets XP in the vicinity of the kill.  You get XP from kills, assists, and captures.  Also making XP gain difficult is that with such a small player base, 90% of the players are already very skilled NS2 players.  If you've never played NS, you will die alot and you will never get XP.\n\nOne of the things I really liked about NS1:Combat is it's more casual gameplay style.  Level gains were quick, if you fell behind, you'd get XP anyway.  Here, if you fall behind, you're done.  You can't really compete when you're low level against a bunch of people with armor, and the game doesn't help you out any.\n\nI've read the upgrade progression is very limiting as well, but I haven't been able to level up enough to run into that problem.\n\nIt's hard to recommend this game to anyone.  If you already have NS2, it's pretty much the same game.  If you don't have NS2, you're going to die a lot, get stuck at the bottom of the scoreboard, and never given any upgrades to help you compete.  A new player would actually have an easier time in standard NS2, as personal performance doesn't matter as much.","November 2, 2014","false","10.5"," 111 of 159 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","111","159","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/daytondoes/recommended/310110/","daytondoes","Dayton Does ¯\_( ͡°Ꮂ ͡°)_/¯","http://steamcommunity.com/id/daytondoes/","1247 products in account","I can hear them in the walls.  In the vents. They’re everywhere.  We need to keep the resources flowing to fund the glorious war effort.  The attacks are relentless.   Most of the time we’re fighting some dog-insect hybrid, helped out by squat little fat ones. It sounds bad enough but sometimes they come a lot larger, and with wings. Carpet bombing, as improved upon with poison. Sounds impossible, but I hadn’t told you about the gigantic horned fellas.  We got mechs to deal with them, but anyone outside one of the tin-cans usually ends up painting some wall.  If we could eliminate the hive, our boys might just stand a chance.\n\nI pick up the comm relay and attempt to call headquarters.  The radio is dead silent. “Commander, are you there? We’re taking heavy fire!”  I construct a turret near the armory to defend it from the horde of stealthy aliens that seems to have fabricated from nothing on the right flank.  The turret is almost complete. With our new turret spewing hot lead at the alien scum, I notice that the display on my rifle shows low ammo, time for a supply drop.  Used to be you’d have someone to do this sort of thing for you, but our commander seems to have gone MIA.  Oh my!  We forgot about the vents!!\n\nThat was only a part of my experience playing NS2: Combat, a MOBA-lite FPS shooter that takes place between aliens and human marines.  The combat feels tight, with every weapon functioning about as you’d expect.  Playing as the aliens is a whole different story, and has a bit of a learning curve as you learn that “Hydra” means “Turret”.  While you may be used to charging headlong into a fight as the marines, the aliens require a bit more finesse and stealth.  The aliens might lack some offensive power, but are much more mobile, with most being able to navigate the vents to flank the enemy.\n\nEventually you will get into the groove and begin stalking those marines via the vents with the best of ‘em.  The strategy used by each team is vastly different, and while it does allow for a taste of something else, you will inevitably find yourself drawn to one team over the other.  I personally prefer the offensive prowess of the marines over sneaky alien tactics.  As long as you keep a nice long line of sight, the marines are almost unstoppable. Just watch yourself while passing any dark corners, as there is bound to be an alien stalking you.\n\nThe gameplay is great, however radar dishes and teleport gates used to be built by your commander, now it’s all up to troops on the ground.  I’m not overly fond of opening menus during FPS combat, for obvious reasons. Skill points are awarded from combat or destroying enemy structures.  Damaging the enemy will reward some experience, while killing him outright means a pretty good chance for a level-up, and another skill-point.  These points can be assigned to a wide variety of perks, from healing faster to jetpacks, from cloaking devices to new weapons.\n\nSome are locked by level, which prevents the entire map from being overrun by the tank-like marine mechs or alien behemoths within the first 5 minutes.  Much like the original Natural Selection 2, with which I’ve logged about 30 hours on Steam, NS2 Combat has a decent pace most of the time.  Some matches can become locked in a stand-still for far too long, depending on the teams strategy, though I really hesitate to call turtling a strategy.  Leveling up can be a bit of a pain, since due to the small community, (about 2 servers worth) there are quite a few hardcore members.\n\nYou will encounter them a lot. Eventually you may be able to overcome them in combat. That day hasn’t come yet for me.  The music is decent, but doesn’t leave any sort of lasting impression, however the graphics and aesthetic are nice enough to keep you well-distracted from the unimpressive music.  There are a variety of graphics options, just in case you wanted your game to be widescreen or windowed.  Technical problems in this game are few, and during my hours of playing my only issue was a sole occurrence with my jetpack getting stuck inside a wall.\n\nI played this game with a mouse and keyboard.  Unfortunately NS2: Combat currently offers no gamepad support, but everything is able to have a new mouse/keyboard binding implemented.  Want to shoot your rifle with the spacebar, and jump with left click? Do it.  You can bind everything exactly as you please.  There are so many rebinding options, that some don’t even have a default key assigned, which is pretty impressive and allows for a large amount of customization. Steam Workshop support is also offered, which will allow you to alter the game even further.\n\nNS2: Combat is nice to pick up and play, but lack of a commander role leads to having to spend your hard-earned level up points on turret and teleport gate construction, which would be fine.  However, few people will actually take this step to help their team win. It’s considerably more entertaining to wield a shiny new flamethrower and jet pack combo.  The control points don’t seem to mean much anymore. So there is no objective other than rushing the enemy base and smashing things, and while that has its time and place, it limits the replayability and tactics that wrapped me up in the original Natural Selection 2.\n\nThe layouts remain much the same, though with a bit less height variation which I can’t disagree with, except that again, it drains any sort of tactics that could be implemented in combat.  NS2: Combat is a game that probably should’ve remained just a mod for the original Natural Selection 2.  It’s great fun, but only because of what the original offered.  NS2:Combat doesn’t really add any value of its own. If you’re in the mood for some straight-forward FPS action with a hint of MOBA and a dash of RTS, I’d suggest picking up the original.\n\nConclusion- Is it Worth Your Money?\n\nAs much as I love the original Natural Selection 2, I have to say NS2:Combat doesn’t offer enough bang to justify your buck.  Instead of adding to the gameplay, Faultline Games stripped away some key elements.  Without commander support, or trying to wrestle resource points away from the opponent, you’re looking at just another Aliens vs. Predator.\n\nSolid 5/10, but doesn't innovate. Get the original.\n\nFull text and photos: http://truepcgaming.com/2015/01/07/ns2-combat-review/","January 6, 2015","false","8.3"," 42 of 60 people (70%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","70","42","60","5","1"

Anything of actual fun in the game is gated behind "level requirements". Nevermind the fact you have the skillpoints to use these abilities, nope. Aliens are heavily affected by this basically rendering all their upper tier abilities a joke. Xenocide is a joke, by the time you get the ability you might as well go onos because you won't be getting those nice 6+ kills from the ns1 3.0 days.

You received experience proportional to how much damage you are doing, in addition to scoring kills. This is probably the largest overall improvment to the game. It allows newer players to keep up with the veterans instead of just getting snowballed in a long painful loss.\n\nCommand Structure armor now only blocks 90% of damage done. This means that you can effectively kill  the command structure as long as you keep attacking it. The motivation behind this tweak was to prevent long drawn out games where one team never leaves base.\n\nAdditionally most of the abilities and weapons have been fine tuned to make each of them a lot more useful. Before, certain abilities (babbler bomb and acid rocket) had no real purpose in the game. By fleshing out the abilities that were somewhat neglected at launch, the overall balance of the game has been much improved, and each build is a lot more fun to play.\n\nFor example, the end game of Combat used to always end up with the marines getting exo suits, and the aliens going onos and gorge to stop it. This made the end game of combat really boring, especially if you don't like playing exo, onos, or gorge.\n\nNow,  with imrovments to acid rocket, fades have a way to harrass exosuits, giving all other alien lifeforms a more pronounced role in the end game.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[[RESPONSE TO LOW PLAYER NUMBERS]] {9-19-15}\n\nThe last few months the game was pretty much dead while the devs and remaining community worked on building a better game. For several reasons, the release of this game was much rushed, and small greivences quickly became sticking points for why people would rather play other games.\n\nThe developers and community have spent the time since then building the game Combat should have been at launch. I'm hoping with price drop, prommotions, and much needed balance improvments, people will be willing to give Combat another chance.\n\nFor all of its problems at release, combat was (and still is) a really fun game, and it's only getting better. Now that the balance patch is out, the developers and community are focused on building the player base back up.\n\nI'm playing games every day, and invite you to come give combat a shot with me.

Not worth a peny, yet it's heavily overpriced. It's a single new gamemode, and for some reason devs decided to make it as an "stand alone" game that technically doesn't add much of new things to it for it to be "stand alone". Could be much better for everyone if the devs just released it as free update for actual NS2, or at least as additional DLC to NS2 that would cost like 10 times less than it does cost now, would made less hate and wouldn't show devs of NS2 as greedy scammers. Not to mention that initially, the "combat" gamemode in NS2 started as community mod project, and it was for free, still better than what we have now here. But in the current state of this "stand alone" game, it's so bad that you probably wouldn't play it even if it was for free.","December 9, 2015","false","12.8"," 15 of 21 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","15","21","0","0"

Yes, this is based on a mod. No, this is not *the same* as the mod. The developers put a good deal of work into it, and that should be rewarded. So please rate the game for how it actually *is*, and not based on some sense of entitlement.)\n\nFor background, I have over 1,100 hours of playtime in NS2 (the game this one is derived from). NS2 is a demanding, heavily team-based FPS/RTS hybrid. Well-performed maneuvers give great rewards, but at the same time, individual mistakes can quickly accumulate and lead to your team's defeat. This is part of what makes it so great - your individual decisions and fights matter. A lot.\n\nBut sometimes, you don't want that kind of pressure. You just want to kill some Aliens/Marines without that much complexity. Or you just have a few minutes to play, where an epic round of NS2 (easily 45+ mins) just won't fit. These are the situations where "NS2:Combat" shines. It retains all of the combat aspects of NS2, but removes the strategy/RTS layer, which greatly simplifies the game. Jump into a server and start fragging. Teamwork is still relevant (and highly recommended), but it is much more straight-forward than in NS2.\n\n\n== The good ==\n\n- Fast-paced gameplay\n- Fun and satisfying combat\n- Nice visuals (like NS2)\n- More opportunity to play advanced weapons/lifeforms than in NS2 - go wild with the Railgun Exosuit :)  <3\n\n== The mixed ==\n\n- Good maps, but only a few\n- "Retro" graphics in menus and loading screens - a matter of taste\n- Some upgrades are so good that they are basically a must-have, which limits build variety\n\n== The bad ==\n\n- Balance needs tweaking (Marines feel too strong early-to-mid game, Aliens are too strong in the end game)\n- Some things could be more self-explanatory (e.g. the upgrade system and "how to play Aliens")\n\n\n== The verdict (tl;dr) ==\n\nIs it fun to play? - yes\nIs it perfect? - not yet, but the issues can be fixed\n\nOverall: recommended\n","November 7, 2014","true","7.0"," 42 of 72 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","42","72","0","2"

I like to know whether I'm getting ripped off or not as it's happened more than once lately. Steam has been letting piles of crap be sold on their service the last several months.\n\nIt seems most of the negative reviews stem from people who already played NS2: Combat as a mod. I have the pleasure of not ever even hearing about this game until I saw it on the steam store. A lot of the negative reviewers seem to complain about miniscule changes to gameplay compared to the mod as well as the extremely low population right now. These are my thoughts ten hours in (yes I know not nearly as many as people would like, but I intend to continue to play this.\n\nGameplay: Having not played the mod, I enjoy the gameplay very much. It's a nice change of pace from the generic FPS flooding the market today. It's very assymetrical teamplay and I've seen it where skilled marines dominate the map, and where skilled aliens dominate the map. It just takes knowing how to play. That being said, the learning curve is *extremely* steep for newcomers.\nI can definitely understand the reviews about veterans making it difficult to jump into. However I can somewhat expect this from a game that was just released that most people have not heard of after being a mod. I've been frustrated several times because of how squishy I seemed. It literally seemed like no matter what side I was playing, I was being instagibbed just from a marine or alien looking at me the wrong way. I severely underestimated the power of armor in this game. Tip for newcomers: if you want to survive more than .5 seconds in sight of a group of marines, stack up that armor buff.\n\nLow population: This game is a relatively unknown game in the world of games. It has no advertising to speak of, was a mod of yet another little known game, and just released less than a week ago. The low population is still a valid statement for reviewers to be making right now. Playing Sunday there were really only 3, maybe 4 populated servers. Couldn't have been more than 70-80 folks at any given time?  Maybe it wasn't the games peak time. Hopefully more people purchase this game.\n\nIt took getting used to the game mechanics, and I'm still relatively noobish but at least I'm getting instagibbed less now. The gameplay is *extremely* fast paced in terms of movement around the environment, whether an alien or marine with a jetpack be-boppin all over the place. It takes getting used to. The game definitely favors those who work/stick together, most lone wolves will die. Often times the games go longer as each side fights the other trying to level up to get a powerful enough force to decimate the enemies base.\n\nThere are only 5 maps in the game, used twice for either control point (not well suited for this game) or what they call deathmatch but you're actually trying to destroy the enemies base. Most of the maps are though out well enough to accomodate both sides. I think there was one where one of the teams could easily trap you in your base and farm, which wasn't fun.\n\nHopefully they do expand the core content with some sort of update (maybe fix jumping so you don't become an invincible marine). More maps would be nice. The current lineup of playable lifeforms and marine upgrades is great. More would always be nice.\n\nTL:DR ("Too Long: Didn't Read" for the new folk): Negative reviews are based on prior biases of players who played the mod forever. The learning curve is very steep and the gameplay is fun and a great change of pace from traditional FPSs. Techncial performance is overall solid with only a couple of minor clipping issues and occasional lag hiccup, neither of which occur often. Bought this game on sale, and can safely say there are much worse games I've spent more money on than this, so I'm happy with my purchase.\n\n\n\n","November 4, 2014","true","132.8"," 66 of 117 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","66","117","0","3"

It was good as a HL1 mod. They spent years to make it a stand-alone. Too many years. The concept is amazing, the original was amazing. NS2 is still amazing but is past its time and the planners farted around too long to make the game whole as a sequel. Now we are faced with dismal community involvement and lack of developer ambition. The developers waited too long and were not financially preparred to meet the requirements of the community.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dmdrusty/recommended/310110/","dmdrusty","|-DMD-| Rusty","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dmdrusty/","512 products in account","Like so many videogames of this genre the aliens as real life creatures would be ludicrous. In Natural Selection II, things work with drama dialled right up, and it's amid this cute Moba of relentless peril that Faultline Games has taken the Natural Selection II Universe once again following in the intimidating footsteps of Unknown Worlds, and produced a fast paced version of the incredibly fun game: Natural Selection II.\n\nNS2: Combat takes the Gorge, Lerk, Fade, Onos, and Skulk back to its roots with a story set prior to the events.  On paper it sounds like a foolhardy idea to create this type of gameplay, however with a whole charisma of new technology and tech trees enabling gamers to define each alien or marine played has begged the question, could you have fun with NS2: Combat?  It is more of the same style as a Moba/RTS/FPS, but in the best way imaginable.\n\n"Boom! Level up!, "\nThe Combat narrative is pretty meaty stuff too, set in the heart of various outposts setup to defend planets from a hostile race, The hopes are to irradiate the humans from the invading forces, and from the other perspective to remove the Kharaa life forms from its facilities.  The game could have quite easily been a counter-strike romp from A to B, dispatching the same abilities for each character, but instead there's a strong levelling system allowing each player to uniquely identify and create their own style of gameplay using the new levelling system.\n\nThe cannon recently added in as the marine Super-weapon has the effect of the Quake 2 Rail-gun.  The largest alien - The Onos is written off as a freak; a bizarre creature, a menace. Chatter among aliens roaming the gloomy corridors and ventilation system reveals marine locations and working as a team can allow you to show up on the scene and prove that you are in fact all too real, that is; If you make your kill.  Being able to act as an alien to blow yourself up in hopes to take out the enemy is quite fun.  There are no "wave respawns" but yet cool down timers for each player individually.\n\nLike the first combat version of Natural Selection, the game is about tactics, map awareness, and lane blocking.  Adding thought into each potential engagement with your teammates is vitally important.  Although essentially the series' core game play mechanics remain untouched, with a few tweaked gadgets such as the welder adding the abilities to open and close areas on maps, allowing dynamic changing of strategies for both teams. The new additions of teleporters allow aliens to build up offensive structures behind such teleporters to ensnare marines immediately through passing thus removing again another lane.  Of course, sending a heavily armored  Chaingun/Railgun "Mech-Warrior" ( Exo Suit ) to blast away any structure to stand in their way can be helpful to the marines.\n\nNS2: Combat is still largely comprised of offensive exploration, free flow combat and teamwork:  Instead of familiarity breeding contempt, this game somehow feels fresh. Even when you bump into an alien you have seen a  million times before,  playing against that alien on a new map gets the blood flowing as you can quickly feel the need for retaliation thus you can run the same route over to show them who's boss.  There's nothing quite like getting the blood of vengeance into someone who's killed you over and over again.\n\nThe map "Kestrel" is an outpost caked in rust and decay, ruled by two opposing forces, the TSF marines, and the Kharaa aliens.   Utilizing Jetpacks, and regenerating armor allows more stealth play.  Aliens can also make themselves completely invisible and watch you as you drop a marine transporter in hopes to have everyone use it to eliminate the alien threat.   This game is a cauldron of deception in tactics, and as each team works hard in thwarting off each other, the more powerful each player gets.\n\nIf anything, late game, there are more large aliens the size of dinosaurs devouring one human after another, and yet they cower behind corners due to the sheer firepower of a marine-driven Exosuit.  If that wasn't bad enough, you have flying aliens releasing coarse gas which burns the lungs of any marine within it's AOE.   There is an abundant raft of upgrade options available to you as you reach the higher levels.\n\nOn top of all of this is an improved and more optimized set of source code in which Faultline Games(FLG) gets to prove their credentials, as the great and much-vaunted NS2: Combat offers better performance and scalability than ever before.  Constantly reviewing server data to tweak the balance of gameplay ensures you don't connect to a game and start from Level 1.  It will appropriately place you where it feels you would best fit in.  More features are being added in and NS2: Combat is fully moddable.\n\nNS2: Combat is not without its frustrations however, and some of the alien encounters and marine battles can prove trying at certain junctures. The balance needs a small overhaul which is set to be hotfixed November 11th, and  locating a server close to you can be difficult if you live overseas. As the game progresses in time, and as more gaming communities and players get on board after launch, there is no doubt that this game will continue increasing in sales.  The current result is entertaining and the ultimate outcome will be seeing more people create friendships in the Natural Selection II Universe..\n\nOn top of a generously multiplayable game labelled as "Natural Selection II"; I question myself: Is NS2: combat a unique enough proposition from Natural Selection II which can  stand out as its own game?  Yes.  The reason for this is simple.\nThe CEO for UnknownWorlds Entertainment said it perfectly.  " I wish to see people create their own games from Natural Selection II, just as I created Natural Selection from Half-Life.".    NS2: Combat was developed by an indie company start-up using their own personal funding to license from Unknown Worlds and create NS2: Combat.\n\nNS2: Combat - Another Moba/rts/fps combat style that demands to be played.\n","November 7, 2014","true","130.0"," 41 of 78 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","41","78","0","2"

I like this game/mod just as much as i like NS2, but i'm starting to think that i made a mistake in buying it. Not because i think it wasn't worth it! Far from it! But because the community is so small. It needs more players or it'll die before it even gets off the ground.\nAs far as i'm concerned, it's fun. It's no more a waste of money than buying CS:GO when you have CS:Source, as i know MANY people did and still do. But at the moment there is at least one server with players on it. That's right! One! So what i propose is that people buy it if you're curious and can splurge a little. If enough people do that then the community will grow and the game/mod will pay for itself easy. But if people don't buy it and play it, the small community it has will eventually die out.\nSo, all-in-all, yes, i recommend the game. It's fun, i enjoy it. I'd like to keep enjoying it. But it just needs more people. I'll update this review if the game every COMPLETELY dies out so you get a heads up. But, beyond that, this game gets a recommendation for people that don't mind the high learning curve or for people that liked Natural Selection 2 but would rather have a simpler experience (as in no commander).\nAlso, if the high learning curve is off-putting, you can probably ask someone to help you out. After all, it's in their best interests to keep a newbie from feeding exp to the enemy team.\n\nEDIT 1 DAY AFTER WRITING REVIEW\n\nI already can't recommend this game anymore. Just got on playing a 3v3 match and now i realize the REALLY big problem with these low population matches. THEY. ARE. SO. BORING! Ugh, i want my money back! Basically the whole game was just the marines hiding in their base with turrets up with my teammates and i running in, getting hurt, and getting healed to give the gorge exp. The only way we could push in was via Onos. That's it! With marines camping their ♥♥♥♥♥ spawn with turrets it took FOREVER for me to go from skulk to onos! That's a fundamental problem with the game that they really should do something about.\nIf only they advertized the game better and sold it at a wiser price, maybe it could have stood a chance. I see about 60 positive reviews about this game. so people need to GET ON AND PLAY IT. At the moment, there's no way I can, in all good conscience, recommend this game.\nI regret paying 15 bucks for it, i'ma just stick with NS2 unless Combat somehow bursts in popularity.","November 18, 2014","false","3.3"," 14 of 29 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","14","29","0","0"

Great quality FPS at an extremely affordable price.\n\nFull Review:\n\nWhen NS2: Combat was first discussed, I like most of the community was very upset that UWE made this decision. The result of which was that I wrote this game off completely due to the fact I would not pay for a mod that was a watered down version of the original NS2.\n\nMy friend invited me to a game and I told him I didn't have it and he gave me a key. I ended up playing for 6 hours straight and had a lot of fun. We had a full server together and there was a running joke that NS2 was actually a mod of this game.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I really enjoy the original NS2 and I would take a good game of NS2 over a game of NS2: Combat anyday, but this ended up shattering my expectations. I feel a little bad for just writing this game off as an outlet for UWE to make money from a mod since this actually ended up being a very good game that could stand toe to toe, and in some regards beats the original NS2.\n\nPlaying vanilla NS2, there was a steep learning curb. As one of the players that played NS1 back in the day, this wasn't an issue for me, but this was always demonstrated through steam sales where we would get an overwhelming amount of players in a server that were brand new to the game. Needless to say this led to some very frustrating situations of explaining minute details of things to new players that had no interest in specific mechanics and just wanted to get into a game and play.\n\nThis is where NS2: Combat beats the original NS2. It doesn't take very much effort to understand how to play the game, which some people might say that it's catering to casuals I would have to ask why that's such a bad thing. What UWE had done with the original game was tailor it for competitive play solely, many changes took place over the course of many updates which required even the most seasoned players to revise their playstyle for balancing competitive play. There was an outcry within the community of this design decision to balance the game in such a way and that there should be different game modes, and UWE's response was that they didn't want to make two different games. So apparently, if they were to balance two different modes it would be two different games entirely. So having a competitive mode and casual mode means two different games? Okay. I'm not going to get into specifics, but there were definitely some silly changes with other things being overlooked by UWE in this regard.\n\nThat aside. NS2: Combat is what it would imply. It's raw combat, where you control your upgrades and your playstyle, rather than having to rely on your commander's decisions. In comparison to the original mod I played, experience is earned by damage done to players now instead of killing players. It seems odd, but actually makes for pretty good play. I didn't really like playing combat for that reason, since it gutted a lot of strategy such as resource control, lost resources due to destroyed buildings, lost resources on resource towers and lost resources on time between resource towers being built.\n\nHowever, if you want to just get in and get into the fight of TSF versus the Kharra then this game is great for that! You can blare your music without fear of missing an important callout or missing a command your commander needed you to do.\n\nAll and all, this is a very good game. It caters to a variety of different playstyles and plays more like a MOBA than an RTS. I would much rather play the RTS version of NS2, but there is a lot of fun to be had in this game and it's definitely worth the price. Very easy for new players to get into the action. I will probably pick up a couple 4 packs so I can hand some keys out to friends to play.","September 22, 2015","true","18.3"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","8","17","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/diothorn/recommended/310110/","diothorn","Diothorn™","http://steamcommunity.com/id/diothorn/","966 products in account","NS 2: Combat Review by Dionysis Spinos (as seen on grabthegames.com)\n\nToday GrabtheGames and I are so excited that we have hands-on NS 2: Combat, a really anticipated game that I wanted to play since it got released on Steam.\n\n\nBut first things first, you will ask me what NS2: Combat is Dionysis? Great question, let me start by saying that it is a first-person team-oriented multiplayer shooter developed by Faultline Games (a small indie studio that formed from the Natural Selection 2 modding scene in 2012) and published by Unknown Worlds Entertainment (the company that brought you Natural Selection 2). The players in this game can choose between 2 sides the Trans-System Federations (TSF) Space Marines or the Alien species known as the “Kharaa”. I liked a lot of things in this game so…let’s start.\n\n\nThe very first thing that I liked in this game is the fact that the 2 sides of the war have completely different sets of life forms and abilities. If you choose to serve the Space Marines you will use heavy and efficient weapons, grenades, mechanized armors (ohh yeah you heard me right…mechanized armors) while the Alien species use more stealth, speed and strength and also the evolution system which lets you evolve from a small Alien (but deadly) to a bigger one …and even deadlier. I should also mention another positive aspect for me which is that the match only last around 15-20 minutes which means quicker matcher and more fun.\n\n\nFurthermore, as far as the music and the sound are concerned there are sooo good and the main menu music is still playing in my head….it really adds something extra while playing the game. What about the graphics Dionysis? The graphics are really good and enjoyable and you will get a pretty good game experience even if you run the game on the lower setting. Also, the devs have took care of the bad aspects of the Natural Selection 2 that caused a lot of FPS drops and other problems and with the spark engine installed the game is now smoother and more beautiful. I also loved in the game, the ready room…it is something really unique to be able to choose sides not simply by clicking a button but by jumping for example from a big height to a huge black hole and the fact that the members of all teams are present at the same time while waiting for the new match to begin is something really enjoyable and fun!\n\n\nLet’s talk about the upgrade/evolution system now. As an Alien and a Marine you will get in game XP by killing other players, fixing their armors etc. and level up (up to level 15). You will be able to use the skill points you get either to get another weapon or upgrade your abilities or even evolve if you are an Alien and kill the enemy team with even more fun ways. Are you bored of playing online? That is ok NS2: Combat has you covered. You can play with bots and practice and as a result you will get better in the multiplayer as well. There are also 2 game modes available capture the point and death match with more thing to come.\n\nNatural Selection 2 Combat first look\nNow time to state the negative aspects of the game, that there are not really negatives since the devs reassured me that they will be addressed soon with a new update and improvements. The first thing that I should mention is the “feeding” as a newbie player on the Alien side of the war you can easily feed the enemy team with a xp and that is sometimes really unfair because in that way Marines can easily gain the upper hand and win the game really quickly. Another negative aspect for me is that there are a few maps to play at this state of the game.\n\n\nI am sure the old players of Natural Selection 2 will ask me why buy it? Why it is not added as a DLC or a free mod? The Devs of NS2: Combat have worked really hard at fixing / creating / amending, source code for at least year, solving all the problems of Natural Selection 2 and creating a really unique experience for old and new player on the Natural Selection gaming Universe. Finally, NS2: Combat is a really good game with a lot of positive aspects and everyone should really try it. It is one of the most enjoyable and competitive games I have played this year, with a really friendly and helpful community. This title definitely deserves to give it a go with more awesome features coming in the near future.\n\nVerdict:\n8.5/10\n\nhttp://www.grabthegames.com/review-ns2-combat.html","November 17, 2014","true","8.1"," 17 of 36 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","17","36","0","0"

(and I many more to come)\n\nDISCLAIMER: I got my copy from the 96 hour mega stream for free, but before you think this swayed my opinion read  "THE TEST"\n\nTHE  GOOD:  The game play is crazy fun with a ton of intence down to the wire moments, and as a resualt people tend to put aside there differences and work  as a team leading to only more fun!\nThis "High Octane" combat mixed with the diversity of evolution buffs/ weapon upgrades can lead to a single player turning the tide for  finding a new  and effective stratage or a team working together to complement eachothers strengths to overwelm the enemy leading to crushing defeats or  jaw droping "in the nick of time" victorys\nIn other words everything it takes to make a fun and refreshing FPS/Moba title.\n\nTHE BAD:  There is a VERY low population in this game at the  moment (over time I have seen it slowly start to grow but at a snails crawl at best)  so unless more people  find out about this game and soon it will probably die before it  can get its own community  :(\nDo to this low population your fun can  sometimes be spoiled when a Very High skilled player(s) uses a weapon/evolution that is a little over powered i.e: gorge bile or Marine jetpack to Stop you over and over with no change from the stratage no diversity no fun the problem  only amplifys if his teamates start using it too.\nLack of content is another issue with the game  (one that I  have been told is in the works to be resolved) the gameplay can be a ton of fun and diverse like crazy, but seeing the same setting over and  over can make it a bit old.\n\nTHE TEST: An awful  lot of NS2  vets have been kindof  bashing this game with out giving new players a chance  to play the game and decide for them selfs if its good or not (to a lesser extent as time goes on, but at launch it was crazy) so  I decided to find out  if the lack of enjoyment was just trolls being trolls or if people were actualy not enjoying the game.\nso I decided I would test this theory out of my own pocket, and purchased 11 copys of the game and  sent them  to  people the split being below\n(4 of my IRL friends 1 Mill sim player 1 fps player and 2 casual gamers) (then to members of a small youtube group I\nam friends with 1 fps player 2 MMO players)(and then some random people on my friends list mostly\ntf2 players) for a totaly of 12 copys\n\nI then invited  them all to a small server with no other players (to prevent vet contamination) and we played a few games for roughly an hour than I  asked them all to leave the game and tell my if from that experience 11 people with little or no experience playing with eachother (out side of the groups they were in)  and 9 of the 11 players said they would love to buy the game  and  play it more\nwe continued to play together in that format with a few other players a  mix of vets and new players hopping in and agreed that aslong as the number of vets were small it was still a fun and balanced game.\n\n\nRECOMMENDATION: I whole hartedly suggest if you have the money/friends to play this game  fps player or not that you  get it as a 4-pack and play it as a group in bot games until you feel  comfortable with your skills than slowly start joining more and more populated servers.\n\nI DO NOT recommend playing this game ALONE (if you are new to NS/Twitch shooters like quake) you WILL be bad when you start playing and it can be draining to play with out friends to goof off with.","November 4, 2014","true","37.2"," 32 of 67 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","32","67","0","0"

Whoops. Sour grapes from people who don't want to pay...\n\nIf you want asymmetrical multiplayer deathmatch* you can't find anywhere else**: Buy it! (*It's not actually deathmatch.) (**You can find it in NS and NS2 mods)\n\nNatural Selection was always a neat game with a neat concept. But, to put the reason for its unpopularity kindly: it is too hardcore. Hour (or two) long games which require concentrated team work and leadership just isn't a popular thing,even if done perfectly. And it's not done perfectly in NS. But the core mechanics, the balance, the "combat" if you will, are excellent.\n\nTackling "commander mode" in NS was just too much for an indie developer which is already working on such an innovative asymmetrical multiplayer FPS design. If DICE can't make "commander mode" meaningful in Battlefield games, what are the chances a random indie will get it right? I don't blame Flayra & friends for anything except their hubris. They stayed with this flawed FPS+RTS design for too long.\n\nNS is a good concept. NS Combat is a good game.\n\nI recommend NS Combat to anyone. But I'm afraid it will die in the cradle. Right now there are 1-2 servers with players at any given time, and they're always the same loudmouth experts you see populating any old dead game. You know the type. The ragers and the complainers and the newbie-scarers. Classic "dead unpopular game" syndrome. Sad, but I am glad I bought it, and I'd buy it again. Warning: If you're the type of person who can't tolerate 30 deaths for every kill in your first week, this game is not for you.\n\nI'm also a fan of Section 8 by Timegate, and FEAR Combat by Monolith, if that tells you anything!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GhoulofGSG9/recommended/310110/","GhoulofGSG9","Ghoul","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GhoulofGSG9/","199 products in account","Ok before I start with this review I’m starting with a few words about myself\nI’m a NS2 Modder and member of the NS2 CDT[forums.unknownworlds.com] who spent up to this day over 1,5k hours modding NS2 and allready 50 h doing the same with NS2:Combat ( i won’t use the term NS2:C because for me that’s the NS2 mod NS2:Classic).\n\nSo my following review might be from a total different point of view than most other ppl have!\n\nTo honor the fact that ns2:combat is a stand-alone i’m trying to forget as much about ns2 first as possible.\n\nSo what is NS2:Combat?\nNS2:Combat is a Moba-FPS where two asymmetrically teams fight each other in currently two gamemode.\n\nThe two available teams are marines and aliens. Aliens are mostly focused on melee fight while marine are classically focused on ranged combat.\n\nWhile playing a round you get so experience points (exp) by killing enemies or assisting your teammates in some ways ( assist a kill, heal them etc. ).\n\nEvery x exp you level up with which you get a skill point you can use to unlock one of certain “skills”.\nThose are either upgrades (more damage, more health etc. ) or as marines new weapons and equipment (e.g. jetpacks or exosuits) or as alien you can evolve into another lifeform or unlock certain lifeform abilities.\n\nThe default game mode is basically known from other moba games: Both team have a main base building which each team has to destroy to win the game. Only the ai creeds and towers are missing.\n\nBut hey both teams have engineer abilities / lifeform which can build up towers if needed to defend a line.\n\nThe second gamemode is a capture points gamemode where each teams has to earn currently 500 tickets to win the round by holding certain points on the map.\n\nIs it any good?\nI would totally answer yes it is if you overall like MOBAs and fast paced action shooters. The "extra spice" ns2:combat has are certainly the two asymmetrically teams.\n\nBut with those we are already at the first issue this game like the parent game (ns2) has:\nThe learning curve.\n\nWhile new players manage to handle marines just fine (trained by most other FPS-games out there), they do struggle a lot with aliens. This leads towards that currently marines win a lot more rounds unless there is some ns2 veteran carrying the alien team (who knows how to handle his lifeform because of the 1k hours spent in ns2).\n\nSo combat would really need a good tutorial specially for aliens (beside the tutorial videos which are there already but i guess no new player ever watches) so those new players are aware how to handle aliens correctly ( e.g. never run directly towards a marine because yeah you are melee and he has a rifle or some other nasty gun with which he kills you before you can even reach him)\n\nBeside that NS2:Combat is certainly a lot fun once you get used to all those things.\n\nWhat i have to note here is that NS2:Combat suffers from the same performance issues as the parent game NS2:\n\nThis means long loading time at first load which they kind of cover up with playing a basic tutorial video at the first start and ofc fps hitches ( both FLG and the NS2 CDT are working at improving this all the time).\n\nSo those (including all the smaller not so critical bugs ) should disappear after a while.\n\nWhy is NS2:Combat so expensive?\nLooking at other reviews other steam users often bring up the point that this game is too similar to the parent game and therefore too expensive.\n\nI can’t deny that NS2:Combat is pretty similar to NS2 looking at everything beside the gameplay (excluding how the weapons and alien lifeforms get handled) but neither does FLG.\n\nThey even named this game Natural Selection 2:Combat and not just Combat. I guess not because of the franchise but because they wanted to make clear from where they are coming.\n\nFLG is a new gaming studio made by ns2 modders just like me. They decided to try to live from their work. And yeah i can totally see that they did a lot in that one year looking at the code (which is btw basically open for everyone who owes the game). So let me state here that another awesome fact is that the game is 100% moddable.\n\nSo why $15? I guess because FLG wants to get something out of it. Everyone familiar with publishing games via steam knows that game devs don’t make anything out of games with prizes lower than $10. And having that in mind the price is totally fair.\n\nConclusion:\nNS2:Combat is a small but decent game for all players who enjoy to play FPS- and MOBA-games. I would recommend it to anyone who is willing to try something new beside the standard framework of those two genres.\n\nYes NS2 and NS2:Combat are not totally revolutionary but they do mix up the given genres in a really good way (in case of NS2 FPS and RTS) and in case of NS2:Combat FPS and MOBA adding a “extra spice” by the asymmetrically teams of aliens and marines.\n\nSo overall if that sounds good for you go for it and buy NS2:Combat :D\n\nAlso by doing so you support a small new indie studio (FLG) and help them to reach their dream of living of making games.","November 2, 2014","true","123.9"," 69 of 146 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","69","146","0","1"

Also keep in mind that it was only two hours of gameplay, I might have not seen everything.\n\nThe game, a few days before it's release felt finished. In the multiplayer sessions, mostly 8vs8, I didn't see any major hiccups, besides the one map that was no finished... but we only played it after the dev asked if we want to.\n\nAs a noob I really was struggling with the different aspects of the game at first, but the more I played, I was riding the learning curve. That curve is something I really love about games like this. It’s everything but casual, yet I think it is still accessible to new players that are not familiar with the franchise at all. Still, my head got ripped off pretty often and only near the end of my last play I managed to level up fast enough to keep up with the experienced players on the server.\n\nThe game is very, very fast and requires good aiming skills. But not only that, you also need to think about what class you are playing and act accordingly. Sounds obvious, but once you played that little starter Alien and get blasted pretty much instantly, you’ll know what I am talking about. You need to think ahead, use different ways like wall-running and going through air ducts, to kill your better armoured and better equipped opponent. Same goes for the marine, that really needs distance between his guts and the “thing” that tries to rip them out.\n\nYou will realize very fast that teamplay is key. Otherwise forward base won’t last long and your base will get overrun. The game has, as many titles nowadays, built in VOIP, that worked very well with a good quality. Use it, communicate, team up and win!\n\nI had a lot of fun and many “omg I died again so quickly” moments, but it never felt unfair or unbalanced. So if you like a new challenge, go ahead and play this game! Bit one tip: maybe really watch the tutorial videos before jumping into the first game… I should have… ;-)\n\nIf you want to see my first impressions, I have a video uploaded here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyLeqXWqLjU\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_sgHYVvw9E\n\nThanks for reading,\nFitzZZ\n\nPS: If you miss the negative aspects, I didn’t hide any but I do NOT say there aren’t some! In the time I played I was so immersed that I didn't notice anything annoying or wrong with the game.

(Because it is their  own separate game, so they do deserve to be paid for it. Beware of misinformation about UWE simply being greedy and chopping up NS2.) There are some advantages to it being a standalone, too, chief among them being more creative freedom for mechanics and content, as well as increased performance due to being able to cut out a lot of the unused systems from the engine.\n\nI am very much looking forward to additional content, balancing, and other features, both from the Faultline team and the modding community at large. The sky is the limit when you have Steam Workshop support, full toolkits available, and a LUA-script based game.\n\nP.S. I don't view complaints about competitor skill as valid grounds for judging a game, but for those who are curious, I've seen an even distribution of marine and alien victories thus far. People love to QQ, but the fact is Natural Selection has always been a heavily skill-based game. Especially combat mode, where most strategic over-layers are stripped away. Instead of trying to bash the game with your shallow negative review and scare people away from trying it, why don't you check your ego and give an objective opinion? Because more players will result in what you want: a more even distribution of skill throughout servers/matches.","November 1, 2014","true","19.8"," 43 of 97 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","43","97","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DarkNintaku/recommended/310110/","DarkNintaku","Ooka","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DarkNintaku/","94 products in account","This game is literally a stand alone version of Faultline Games' mod to Natural Selection 2.  If you like Natural Selection 2 and enjoy playing it then you will enjoy this game.\n\nIf you have not played Natural Selection 2 then do not buy this game until the developers add a demo of some sort.  This is a multiplayer game akin to Team Fortress or tribes, there is no single player content aside from playing against extremely rudimentary bots.\n\nThis game is built on the premise of being a competitive asymmetrical pvp game that is fought between two factions: Marines and aliens called the Khara.  Marines are similar to playing an older FPS with contemporary mechanics.  The Khara are similar to playing a handful of different games.\n\nThere is a player leveling system based on experience points gained in game.  There is a character progression system in play sessions that levels up the player character to unlock things in the game.  On the Marine side this in-session leveling system is used to unlock guns and exosuits.  On the Khara side this system is used to unlock abilities and new classes.\n\nA general description of the game paints it as intruiging, which is true: the concept is interesting.  The execution is where most of the game's shortcoming come from.  There isn't enough to differentiate this game from Natural Selection 2, but instead it feels like the in-session progression system is a half-baked mechanic.\n\nThis game's success is dependent on it being different enough from Natural Selection 2 to draw players away from it, and yet it is not.  It is so similar to Natural Selection 2's mod called Combat that many players who like the series are staying there or boycotting this game.\n\nOn average there are 30 players playing this game, and those are mostly the holdouts who want the game to succeed.  On Octorber 30th the game had a large spike in players going up to 116, then increasing to 128 players by Nov 1st.  However, these numbers droped to 56 by Nov 4th, and have more or less been on a slow and steady decline.  It appears that new players join the game and then quit shortly after.\nThis should tell you the kind of game you are getting here.  If new players are joining and then quitting within a week then there are massive problems with the game itself.\n\nThis game's biggest problem is that it does nothing to retain new players.  The players who are already playing and have hundreds of hours in the game and love it will continue playing—they are the holdouts—but new players will play for a week or so and then quit to play something more accessable.  New players are pitted against experienced players and there are no mechanics to help new players win.  There are no first optimal strategies that have low skill and reward ceilings such as CoD's noob-tube, Street Fighter's thousand hand slap, or Unreal Tournament 99's rocket launcher.\n\nNew players are thrown into a meat grinder, and they quickly decide they do not want to play this game.  People who are enjoying it will tell them that it takes 50 - 200 hours to properly enjoy the game, but the problem is that there is nothing to ease new players into enjoying the game.  No lower skill strategies that evolve into higher skill strategies whereby noobs become pros.\n\nThe other primary problem with this game is the community.  The developers will ban people from the forums for "trolling" and then cite their rules instead of actually trying to find out what is wrong and why the player feels negatively about the game.  The community itself can be extremely toxic, and that just leads into negativity going all around.\n\nIf you live in the E.U. you can more or less try this game without risk since you can return it after playing it if you do not enjoy it.  If you live outside the E.U. where that law does not apply then buy at your own risk.\n\nIf you speak negatively about this game the developers will, instead of working towards making their product better, pursue you onto whatever social media they can find that you use and harass you there.  True professionals, though it is good for a laugh from time to time.\n\nThis will tell you how many people are playing the game before you buy it.\n\nhttp://steamcharts.com/app/310110\n\nI regret this purchase.  A great many other people also regret buying this.  Many of the posititve reviews are either from developers or people who absolutely loved the mod before it became a standalone.  The negative reviews come from people who are not pros at Natural Selection 2.","November 13, 2014","false","9.5"," 10 of 28 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","10","28","0","0"

If you enjoyed combat in the original Natural Selection or just like the idea of playing Aliens vs. Marines but can't be bothered with all the building and structure maintenance that comes with playing Natural Selection 2. You'll most likely enjoy Combat simply because there's only 1 objective, kill the enemy and level up. Unless of course you're looking for a CTF style of gameplay, which this game also offers. I can't really say anything bad about NS2: Combat, the developers are friendly hard working people dedicated to producing a top notch product and the 76 hour stream/Q&A showed just that.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/quintox/recommended/310110/","quintox","Quintox","http://steamcommunity.com/id/quintox/","90 products in account","What is going on..Let me start with this: NS2:Combat is an excellent game. And I don't really understand why people are complaining about the price, 15,- bucks is hardly worth mentioning. Give the developers some slack, they've put time and effort into creating this game and it has turned out much better then the mod could ever be. I remember paying money on CS:GO, arguably it's the exact same thing.\nDon't try to compare it with NS2 just because it uses the same assets, see the game as a combination of NS2/Quake/Ut/Dota. It's extremely fast paced, very hard to master but it's incredibly rewarding once you top the charts.\n\nI don't agree with people saying it's unbalanced, I've seen aliens and marines win in both rush games and long, tense turtle fights. Just today we lost the game as marines simply because we made 1 little mistake in our defense and the alien team was smart enough to exploit that weakness, we lost that game against all odds ( we were far superior the entire match ). Saying it is unbalanced just because you have a hard time catching up with the speed of the aliens, or because you're not used to the gameplay aliens have to offer isn't fair to the game.\nQuake3, Painkiller, UT99 were all hard games and you did get dominated and humiliated ALOT. It was simple "Get better, or simply die" and that was OK. Why is it a bad thing to have a steep learning curve and to actually see yourself grow ( and lose at first)? Isn't it that much more rewarding once you actually get better?\n\nAbout the community:People on the forums are saying the community is bad and elitism roams freely ( imo that is as usual the very vocal minority ). To those guys I say: Please, enlighten me, show me these unpleasant encounters. I've been playing on "The thirsty Onos" for a couple of days now, and I haven't seen a single negative comment or elitist punk hammer on others. What I do hear is laughter, people having fun,  voice communications, instructions, jokes and frankly people are having a blast on that server. Where do I find this terrible community you mention? I honestly can't share your experience. Check out the numerous Twitch streams ( MaxxPlays for example ) and decide for yourself what the community is like.\n\nThe game:As I said before, I love it, it's excellent! Well balanced, extremely fast paced and highly rewarding. You would expect a huge cluster♥♥♥♥ and bottleneck, which at times does occur yes, but the perks and upgrades have been well thought out to counter this and to move the game forward. If you're not that good of a shooter, please go ahead and pick one of the support/heal/build upgrades to support your team and still get XP for doing so. If you do know how to hit your target, you will definitely have a blast at this game. I mentioned before that it reminds me a lot of twitch arena shooters like Quake/UT with elements from MOBA/RPG games. If you're a fan of arena shooters with a certain RPG element, you're seeking a challenging FPS and don't want to get nurtured ( like CoD does ), then you'll most likely enjoy NS2:Combat.\n\nCon:\nIt still has a very tiny and fragile playerbase, it might not even survive and die fairly soon. Which would be a huge bummer because it's a great game. There are plenty of servers in the list, but only like 2, maybe 3 are populated. Those servers do have quite a few very skilled players, which for me isn't a bad thing ( I love it ), but I can imagine new players might get overwhelmed. Then again, there's no better motivation then wanting to beat skilled players right?\n\n\nGeneral thought:\nPeople saying elitism and flames are what destroying MP games. I disagree.. e.g. Counter-Strike lasted for 10 years and is still one of the best MP games ever produced. It had one of the worst and disrespectful communities out there, but still lasted a VERY long time. I think the complaining vocal minority that floods every forum ( not just NS2's or Combat's ) is the reason for games to expire prematurely these days. The non-stop complaining about everything. If only people wouldn't get upset or offended so easily, the world would've been a better place..","November 5, 2014","true","7.7"," 25 of 66 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","25","66","0","0"

The game doesn't give very much and it feels like you're playing normal NS2.

The players are free to do anything they want and which is a huge change: each player chooses his own upgrades/abilities.\n\nYou can join either aliens or marines. Both teams have specific upgrades, which you get by killing enemies or helping team. They are very diffrent, as a human you can choose to have grenade launcher, flamethrower, SMG, be a robot, have jetpack and other awesome things!

NS2 Combat should have optimized your settings to allow the games loading times to be a bit quicker. Not saying there a VAST improvement but they're much better then NS2.
