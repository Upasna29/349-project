The developers of SnowBird put a lot of effort\nto completely revamp the game and provide players with greatly enchanced experienced. Different than what players had expeirienced so far on this engine. Did they succed in that? Yes they did!\n(It's still the same game, but honestly there are some things I didn't even have idea they are possible on this engine. Mainly the missions.)\n\nAt the very first glance, player may think to himself that not that much has changed, but do not let that fool you. In just a couple of minutes you are guaranteed to get amazed with creativity and new possibilities.\n\nMy personal number one, would be the new taverns, where not only you can play BlackJack, or hit another guest with a chair, but also take on the... less legal missions. And the variety of these... is just amazing.\nWhile these I'll call them mini-missions are usually very hard, they are also just so much fun, you get to escort an individual and protect him form assasin attacks, or try and seize the control of a ship stationed in the docks, there are hold out missions, and even sabotage ones. With the time I spent in the game so far, I haven't had time to get bored with these.\n\nThere are also various interesting missions from the governors from other countires.\n\nNow I'd also like to talk about the capture system. Most likely most people assumed that new system for being captured is something they won't be using all that often, since they instantly re-load the game if they are defeated. But honestly, on the low levels if player is not careful it's quite easy to end up as a slave and the trasition is so fluent there is no time to load the game. Sure you can still do that a moment later, but honesetly I myslef haven't done so once. Getting ready for your uprising and finally trying to break out free is a lot of fun.\nHowever, you should remember that your goal is to escape throm the plantation or mine, not to kill all the guards. Even with huge uprising like 80 out of 107 prisoners, the plantation garrison is just very strong. So do not waste your chance trying to kill all of them - run for your life.\n\nThe Sea battles and feet management have been changesd slightly too. 1) You can now own several fleets stationed in different Bays or ports.\nYour ships not being currently used by a character can be always used to form a convoy and sell goods. Be wary of the pirates though! The Sea battles themselvs are now happening in a bit faster pace, and ships are slightly more responsive... Personally I liked it like it was, but this was popular complaint, so it was adressed. There is also a new mechanic, that allows to destroy cannon or cannons of enemy ship. The same may happen to you though!\n\nLast thing I will take note of, is there are a couple of new character skills, one allowing player to cheat in Blackjack more efficently, the other one allows player army to use more cannons, and makes canoneers more efficient. Ah right, about the cannons, they play a lot bigger role in\nsieges now, along with destructible defense structures.\n\nThere are many more new features, that I am planning on writing about, but I will add these later on, since I want to post this review as quickly as possible :P\n\nFor the Multiplayer gamemode, at this stage it's only a very early beta, so I will not include it in the review just yet. This aspect of the game will be updated according to player needs / requests, but it will take some more time. At the very moment it's only a bare skeleton. Hoping an update will come soon.\nAt this point I'm sure no one needs further proofs that developers will deliver on their promises if given enough time.","December 10, 2015","true","32.5"," 141 of 157 people (90%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","90","141","157","7","3"

If you like Mount and Blade styled games, you should definately pick this one up.  As of this writing, the game is still fairly unstable.  There are a plethora of bugs and glitches, however any real Mount and Blade fan is used to this kind of thing.  First time players of a M&B style game may find the bugs too much to handle.\n\nDespite those shortcomings, this game is still incredibly fun.  It has the one thing that defines all Mount and Blade games;  the ability to start as a worthless bum and work your way up to a king.  The game doesn't tell you what to do, you have to go out and take ports for yourself in any way that you wish.  This game is about raiding conveys is search of dat booty.  This game is about cheating at cards and then beating the daylights out of an entire tavern full of drunks.  This game is about starting a war that will end tens of thousands of promising young lives just so you can see all the towns on the world map have your faction color.  This game is about being defeating in battle and being sent to a prison camp where you try to organize a prisoner uprising and fail to such an extent that you injure your head and become permenantly dumber.  Can you really afford to not try this out?\n\nIn conclusion, whether you like to yo ho or prefer to diddly dee, you should find this game to be an exciting pirate adventure.","February 1","true","101.7"," 64 of 68 people (94%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","94","64","68","12","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ivantengu/recommended/413710/","ivantengu","Ivan Drago","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ivantengu/","46 products in account","I started as a small time pirate looting unfortunate enough small boats. Then I went on a quest in the far, far away town to find out governor's source of income. Plan was to seduce governor's daughter so she can tell me the dirty secret. She was reserved, but after few nice gestures and the night out in the inn, she opened up. Her father was arrested, but then we fell in love. so I became the new governor and formed my own faction. Suffice to say, England, my former ally, was bitter because of that.\n\nI tried to manage all this state affairs, but it wasn't easy. Economy was weak so I decided to go pirating and gather some cash. Few moment later, I spotted ongoing battle between my allies and new enemy, England. It was rather huge battle for me at the moment - lots of galleons while I had meager one-deck-of cannons boat. I said what the heck and went straight into the battle. I waited until both parties were exhausted, then grape-shoted one galleon and boarded it. Melee fight started, my heroes and well trained boarding party fought well. We got the ship!\n\nNow, after owning heavy galleon I started intercepting English trade convoys. I established my own trade routes. Money was flowing. My reputation grew. Then one day, while passing near the Spanish city, I saw huge English navy besieging the city. I could see fiercest ships - 1st,  2nd, 3rd ships of the line. And the Spanish city fell. So it was time for me to get hell out of there. But then I was small group of ships - 2nd and 3rd ship of line, breaking from rest of the attack force. It was time to do my vulture tactics again!\n\nI went into the battle - and there where two ships sailing straight into me. I started damaging the sails of the first ship, while cornering so second enemy ship didn't have the clear shot - first one was blocking her view. Then I switched to grapes, and decimated first ship's crew. Turned out tactic was good - crew count fell from 550 down to 50! Then I made a sharp turn and boarded the ship. After a quick battle one of the biggest ships were mine. I didn't have enough crew to sink the other enemy, so I managed to retreat. Some of my crew weren't happy, but hey, we won the jackpot!\n\nI wasn't home for quite some time. My relationship with my wife began to deteriorate. Meanwhile, she was fighting natives and protecting the land. So I headed to my land. In was at that moment I saw several English ship of the line convoys following me. They wanted a revenge. But hey, I can outrun then, right? So I was sailing across the Caribbean, while enemy was behind my feet. They were relentless. I reached my city, but the didn't stop. I went inland by foot, by they also did that! ♥♥♥♥, this was going to be bad. But then, I could somehow cover my tracks so they lost me. I returned to the town, got my wife, and boarded my new ship. I left the garrison in the city because enemy was still there somewhere. Maybe my only city will fall and I will lose my faction. Who knows?\n\n","January 23","true","56.7"," 42 of 46 people (91%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","91","42","46","6","0"

I was sorely unimpressed with the original project, and seriously considered filing for a refund. However, the devs promised to hammer out the bad, so I stuck with them. And then we received our copies of this beauty. And it has been all uphill from there. I love evey aspect of this game, from the classic, Pirates!-style combat, to the extremely in-depth story that you can develop for your character. It is less about who you were before the game started, and more about where you are headed. Fall in love with the Governor's daughter and start your own kingdom. Strike fear into the hearts of men pirate, merchant, and soldier alike. Toil in a mine while you plot your escape with fellow prisoners who are enslaved with you, The options are insanely varied. And entirely up to you. I'll edit this to add bullet points to it later, but I sincerely hope that more people decide to give this game a chance. It is really a diamond that fell out of a lump of coal. Also not sure if this counts as having received this product for free, as I paid for caribbean.","May 10","true","24.9"," 45 of 51 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","45","51","0","0"

I haven't read into it, but I'm pretty sure this is the game they care about now, and sort of just left Caribbean! in a dumpster after the prom.\n\nIf you have played Mount and Blade, it'll feel familiar, due to it using the same engine and whatever, so thats fun. The naval combat is comparable to Sid Meier's: Pirates!, though a little more blocky, and sometimes I don't quite get where my cannons are supposed to be firing, though overall its pretty good. The boarding party, ship-to-ship, trench combat is not the best. If you have a big crew/party, buckle up, especially if you or your enemy has a small ship, it gets very cramped very quick. Pretty certain I've killed more of my crew than the enemy has. If you and your foe have a big ship and big crews, it can be fun. Now for land battles, I haven't gotten far in that aspect. In Caribbean! I had cannons and the whole shabang, and that was great and all, though the mechanics were weird, and there was no friendly fire from cannon. I don't know if cannons work the same in this, but land battles are still fun, positioning units can be a little rough, but the maps are decent sized. I have helped siege a town, and those are gruesome. The enemy, in the city I attacked, had little cannons on the wall, shooting out at you as you stormed the beach. They said they would make sieging difficult, and they delivered, so well done there. The town only had 300 or so, and the people I was helping, and myself, had about 500-600 and we ended up limping away with 300 give or take. This was also near the beginning of the game, so elite troops were scarce, but even so.\n\nThe quest system is pretty neat, there is a variety of things you can do, from blowing up a mine, defending a mine, or even lighting ships on fire. The only downside to these is that you only have a finite number of troops, like 7 or so, and the enemy has 7 or so waves, consisting of 7 or so guys each. Just have to find a corner and let them come to you.\n\nIf you are a woman, and go do stuff with ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, you get reknown.\n\nI haven't yet experienced the prisoner side of life yet, but when I do I'll be sure to elaborate, but I've heard its great.\n\nMost of the other things in the game are pretty much like they were in Caribbean!, other than you need a clerk in a town to build, which is easy just annoying to do each town. I don't know how much this game is, like I said got it for free, but its pretty good. Watch out for the natives. They are crazy strong. 9/10","January 8","true","5.9"," 28 of 32 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","28","32","2","0"

The campaign maps includes all of the important towns in the Caribbean, where different factions vie for supremacy. Each city includes a tavern where subordinate leaders can be recruited, a shipbuilder for purchasing or repairing ships, a market for trade, a mansion for missions, and a town hall to purchase and manage factories. Party members gain experience and earn upgrades through combat, which can take place both on land and in the sea. Terrestrial battles mirror those found in Mount & Blade, while naval combat is fairly traditional: movement using the wind to position cannons towards the enemy, with different types of shot available and boarding actions once crews have been diminished. Blood & Gold: Caribbean! feels and plays like a somewhat substantial modification of Mount & Blade (which it is), with all of the pluses (freeform living world) and minuses (many rough edges) that particular game engine entails.","January 12","true","10.7"," 24 of 28 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","24","28","2","1"

Needs some work still, but they are putting out decent patches frequently. For now I will give it a thumbs up, but that may change.\n\nMostly because of this companies past with suddenly dropping a game like a bad habit. I.E. Mount and Blade with fire and sword. i LOVED that version of MB and they had a great thing goign with it, but just suddenly stopped working on it. It was one or two pacthes and content additions away from being truly epic. And dont give me that nonsense about mods, i generally do not do mods. If mod fixes a bunch of brokeness in a game, then the game makers should BUY that mod from the modder and incorperate it officially into the game, since the modder did their job for them.\n\nBut at any rate, this game so far is fun and worth the price. They seem to be fixing it up and it really will come down to the last few patches and if they manage to add any content to the game.

But now, I must erase that way of thinking, and even offer Snowbird Games an appology. This new game is quite astonishing. I would still consider it an early access game at this state, but even now it looks like it would be a fun and enjoyable game. And there's another factor to my support for this game, it isn't over yet! There are still many cool new features to come in the future! This is an example of excellent development. You can begin proper businesses (something Mount and Blade failed at), and there are many little changes that make me like the game even more. Example- getting to walk around your cabin when in the "camp" menu while sailing the seas. Also, the naval combat is quite nice. Not amazing, no. Could use a ton of work, but at this state I'd say it's a success there also. The introduction of artillery was also interesting, and even though I haven't had the chance to use it yet- I am really happy with the innovation. Keep up the good work Snowbird, I hope to see amazing results!","December 21, 2015","true","4.0"," 23 of 31 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","23","31","0","0"

A Remade Review.\n\nBlood & Gold Caribbean is an improvement over its original.  Many of the player suggestions have been addressed.  Much of the content, that the developers pulled from the M&B Engine, has been re-introduced.  Below is my Pro's and Con's.  Many pro's represent improvements over the original.\n\nPRO:\n-Taverns now feel more connected to the Caribbean, nice immersion\n-Classical use of the Battle Interface hot-key commands are well re-implemented\n-Re-introduction of the zoomable map\n-Quest content expanded in fun, cool, and immersive ways\n-Ship-boarding battle is well made\n-The plantation combat is a nice addition, with fields that hide soldiers\n-Dev provided this remake for free to original game owners, this  healthy show of respect for the player-base is noted, and should be counted\n-Devs-Active against bugs! (Less than a week after I posted this review with a bug listed, they fixed it!).\n\nCONS:\n-Whoever heard of a pirate ship full of non-combatants! Sailors are pacifists... and fighters are hard to come by... Serious? SERIOUSLY, the division of combatants vs sailors is very wierd and problematic\n-Pathfinding is pretty bad. Click on one place and be auto-navigated into an enemy port in the other direction\n-Lots of sword-swinging, with no connections (weapon coding or collision animation issues?) Watching mounted-swordsman fight for eternity without severely reduced ability to kill each other is sad\n-Ship cannonade, has no aim tool or overlay, and you often can't even see where your firing\n-Limited Blackjack Players - "Oh, wait, am I in the wrong crowded tavern? Oh, okay, I'll sail the other side of the Caribbean, there should be one over there... DANGIT, wrong one... ."\n-Walking around the town is purely cosmetic...\n\nVERDICT: The game is an improvement over the original, but that does not mean it is ready for play.  With some corrections, I feel this game could easily switch over to a positive review... but with BADLY done cannonades (you can't aim), and swords that frequently don't hit, and pirate crews that are programmed to be non-combatants... HUH?  It would be funny, if it didn't frequently lead to frustrating situations that shouldn't exist.  Maybe get it on sale, and hope the Devs fix these OLD issues.","December 11, 2015","false","4.5"," 58 of 94 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","58","94","0","13"

I followed the previous game "Caribbean" and hoped for a good release.\nWhen I saw that Caribbean was gone from the shop, I found, that the game got re-released with a new name etc.\nReading the user reviews and the blog I thought "Lets give it a try". I love the pirate scenario and I loved M&B.\n\nAfter some hours into the game I reconciled, that it is a bug infested, badly optimized and overpriced mod of the glorious game M&B:\n\n- every time when you go from navigation map to town/fight it lags horrible.\n- Often when trying to "go ashore" it crashed without a good explanation "Trying to find a solution".\n- (Pathfinding) Most of my fights on land with some indians (outside of missions) ended in a stalemate, because all the indians run into the void (big river, 2 bridges) and my guys tried to shoot em and got speared. Imagine that, trowing a spear from 50m stright up and killing a armored spanish soldier...\n- I dont know exactly how many music tracks this game has.. but I found it very repetitive and on other occasions the game was just mute.\n- Apparently enemy ships without crew will still shoot at you, maybe the tracking system is a bit off, because when I boarded there was all the time atleast one person fighting me and my crew.\n- When visiting a pirate town you get negative affection for a colonial power (very good spies perhaps?)\n\n+ The battles from quests were fine but you cant order your soldiers to stay put or follow.\n+ Naval fights were fun but I found my ships often shoot at ghost ships and you cant change ammunition of your fleet.\n\nI refunded this game, because I could and I did not have fun playing. I would not have done that for a early access title!\nUnfortunately the devs decided to release all the features without proper fixing, so I would say at the current stage it is a Beta version and not final. @Devs: Maybe take some time to fix all the problems, make adjustments and improvements.\n\ntl:dr\nGame is badly optimized, crashes alot, music stinks.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/loonyyy/recommended/413710/","loonyyy","Captain Awesome","http://steamcommunity.com/id/loonyyy/","316 products in account","Ok, so my review is basically a bug list that needs fixing from the devs:\n\nCrashes when trying to retreat during special missions. Being able to see the battle play out is ok, but your maps often mess up the pathing, and then it can take forever. There's no way back to the menu screen then.\n\nNot being able to control your men during special missions. If you ask me to do a 31 v 31 skirmish with native gear against armed enemies, then letting me use the basic mount and blade commands would be nice\n\nThe command and control system has gotten worse from Warband era Mount and Blade, I haven't played enough Fire and Sword to comment. There's a map, but it's unintuitive, didn't work for me while trying to move units, and it plays out in real time. I used to just ride my horse towards the nearest high point and tell infantry and archers to stay there. Now I have to sit on my horse and wait for them to get there. Not good.\n\nHorseman are worthless. Don't pick up any Harquesibiers if you plan on fighting on the land. You'll bury them the next day. If you get them to follow you, and make sure they hold off, and play a retreating action with them you can inflict some casualites, but they have really, really low survivability, even if you don't let them get mobbed. Often I'll steamroll an enemy, but lose most of my stupid horse gunners.\n\nArmour is key, but doesn't seem to scale up nicely. I'm still on a fairly easy difficulty, and the armour is tissue paper. Especially to guns. Taking 27p damage in a 32 head protection helmet when I can't even kill regular troops on every hit with a high end gun is infuriating. I guess it doesn't matter so much since the armour costs nothing once you start raiding convoys, but still.\n\nYou can't do anything to avoid a boarding. If the AI thinks it will win a boarding, it will charge you, if not, it will sail in circles firing it's cannons. It's really obvious, really quick. So if the enemy boat comes at you, fire on it with a broadside and run away. Use your chainshot and it'll stop. It's fine for now, but it's going to get old soon, which brings me to the next point.\n\nBoarding combat is really damn stupid. I don't seem to have any way of knowing how many men I'll field, how many combat troops I have on each boat, or assigning them, I can't order my men to stand grand, so if I'm outnumbered, there goes picking them off and using a local numerical advantage to inflict some casualties.\n\nTaverns are just annoying. Fix the layout. I don't want to climb stairs to do anything.\n\nEvery menu takes forever to load.\n\nYour ship will automatically land if it bumps into a port. This will cost you tax, and take a while, loading, more ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Sometimes pathing will do this for no reason.\n\nMultiple ship boardings aren't possible.\n\nI do really like this game. It shows a lot of promise, and a lot of people asked for it. But it needs serious patching, and probably some content updates. I just can't recommend it to you if you aren't willing to put up with the bugs. It's mount and blade on ships, and yeah, for the most part it works, even with the clunky, dated engine and combat limiting the boarding action. Like Mount and Blade, you can fall into a rhythm of progress and have a lot of fun. Just, look up a tutorial first. Recruiting is dumb, and you need to recruit heavily. There's a message board in towns for it. You advance a lot quicker in this game than the originals, or maybe I'm just better. The combat feels harder, and I played on fairly hard difficulties, full damage, full speed, full size, etc in Warband, which is good and bad. Getting better ships is based on "Rank" which is based on your reputation, which lags far behind what you can do combat wise. It's easier to steal better ships than buy them, which becomes more of a problem as you start looking at attacking Captains for their ships.  I've got a fleet of Light Galleons, still chasing down a medium or an even better ship and the best I can buy is a brig.\n\nUpgrading ships is expensive. Don't do it until you have a decent ship, otherwise you're wasting time. Don't be scared to sell ships and upgrade.","February 12","true","48.2"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","0"

I got this game early on when it was just Caribbean and it didn't live up to expecations, however this remastering has made it an overwhelming enjoyable game. It is your standard MB experience; start off with nothing, raid convoys, create a kingdom, etc. I like that they over hauled battles so in the begining you get a Total War feel as you setup your units, and there are even cosmetic units like drummers too. Combat is the same as MB, love it or hate it. Ship battles are decent with fast forward buttons to speed them up if you feel they are slow.\n\nFew nitpicks though that stop this from being Warband.\n\n-Dead online community. Tried Multiplayer twice, no servers.\n-Lack of mods. While there is a module system, I have yet to find any player made modules.\n-Limited flags. Only 8 compared to the dozens in Warband.\n\nand as a final nitpick, most of the companions hate it when you raid ships... in a game about pirates. Not going to count off for that, just found it strange that we didn't have more evil characters. I want to ♥♥♥♥ ships and pillage women, not be a trader (though you can do that).\n\nSo do I recommend the game? For $20 it is slightly more than I would prefer to pay for it (I would value the game at $10-$15), but it is still worth it expecially with the free DLC the devs give us.","May 17","true","34.0"," 18 of 25 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","18","25","0","1"

I did not see many of the things I'd wanted for the game, but I still played it, and I still loved it. I'd seen many posts declaring the game dead! Then, soon after I first purchased the game; the developers announced that a new game was coming out; so as to "restart." When this new game came out, I was thrilled! I started a new singleplayer campaign, and while it did not appear to contain many of the things I'd wanted, it was overall vastly enjoyable and spectacular in short. The multiplayer, too, while early in development; was amazing. I'd say more, but I'd like the reader to see for him/herself. It's worth the money, and you should try it if possible.

They could have taken the money and run like so many independant developers have before them, but they stuck with it. This is clearly a point of passion for the devs and their perseverance should be enough to warrant a purchase.\n\nWe need to support good business practices in the games industry, this is an example of that.\n\nOh, and the game is fun albeit more difficult than Mount and Blade. This isn't artifical difficulty either, it's because Blood and Gold has things that Mount and Blade doesn't that makes a lot more sense in a roleplaying environment.\n\nExample: You get captured by bandits, they take EVERYTHING (put your money in banks), then you have to manually escape by killing guards and making your way to the exit.\n\nMy main criticism would be that at the start of the game, there's very little direction. There's no merchant of Praven to set me on my first quest, showing me the extreme basics of the game. This can be offsetting for any new players to the Mount and Blade-style games.\n\nAlso, what happened to the pretty world map from the original release of Caribbean?

But the other day I opened my STEAM to see... low and behold.. THIS.\nIts the entire game basically redone. It adds everything they said the original would have, and it was fun to fire up long enough at this time to see how it goes..\nI wont say it will ever hold me for hours and hours right now.. I am just not in anything like Mount and Blade gameplay at the moment.. but here is why I write this now..\n\nIt was totally free. The company basically said.. ( not quoting, paraphrasing here... ) Hey that game we made and you bought.. it sucked.. we know it..

There are also missionsincluded, these missions can be obtained by a certain person who appears in every tavern. These missions include, assassination contracts, escorting contracts, beating up nobles, taking over mines or plantations, destroying mines or plantations amongst other things.\n\nA brand new feature is if you happen to be taken prisoner you are now sent to either a mine or a plantation were you are forced to work as a slave, you can recruit prisoners and start an uprising and if it is succesfull you can escape with the prisoners. This is a great feature as it adds realism and makes every battle stressfull as you know if you fail your going to end up as a slave.\n\nAs well as all that there is also a multiplayer that is extremely enjoyable just like any mount and blade game, so far the multiplayer has been the best part for me.\n\nALSO IT'S FREE IF YOU ALREADY OWN CARIBBEAN!","December 10, 2015","true","11.5"," 15 of 22 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","15","22","0","0"

At the end of the day I can only call Black Flag a decent pirate game, but it's too Assassin's Creedish for me.\n\nBlood & Gold gives you a brilliant boarding fight, interesting missions (even a stealth mission!), a good sea battle (it's pretty basic but I enjoy it).

This review takes in account the changes to the former version.\n\nThat being said, although there were many new changes and additions, I still wouldn't recommend the game. Sure, I enjoy my time in this game, but you have got to be a huge M&B fan and get a hardon from pirates in order to like Blood and Gold.\n\nThere are a lot of new mechanics since the game changed its name. For example, setting up an enterprise is made easier and more detailed, going ashore now leaves your boat in the harbor, so you have to go back there to sail again and there are all new sorts of missions.\n\nStill, even though there are many new additions, they all work as well as the main mechanics: not good! I wonder how this studio took everything M&B had, but made it worse. Really, the whole tactical part of battles is glitchy and some options are left out (like ordering your troops to stand closer to each other). Also, general performance, graphics, and small details in the item balance and economy are apparently downgraded. Not to mention the countless bugs.\nBut I can't stress enough how much fun this game is, if you're willing to look past the initial - mind I say, huge - flaws. It's M&B with pirates and a decent naval battlesystem, very surprising and diverse new missions and the overall feel of being a complete badass as a pirate.\n\nConclusion? This game or mod if you will, isn't worth twenty bugs due to all the downsides. Still, the mechanics are there and this game is promising. I just hope the developer keeps polishing the game and soon, I'll probably recommend it. For now, stay away from this game unless you know M&B and you know how crappy but incredibly fun the mods can be.

I got the game on sale at a reasonable price for what it delivered. Full price I would vote down because of glitches and bugs.\nSome reviewers have compared it to Sid Meirs Pirates. It is nothing like Pirates, it comes from Mount & Blade which it shows very clearly. Comparing the two is like looking at apples and oranges. They are both fruit, both round, both from a tree but nothing like each other.\nIt is a fun romp in the pirate world but basically a mod of Mount & Blade not something just using the same engine. Areas it does very well such as boarding an enemy ship. Ship to ship combat, not so much. Often I would close to fire a broadside and abruptly I was suddenly in a boarding action? Really? So if I can see the other ship on the screen to fire a broadside it can board me? So you need to fire blindly looking for a little marker that says the other ship is in range but not on the screen.\nGetting quests to chase outlaws or robbers on the islands is much harder than finding smugglers. Why? They disappear into towns, platations, or even coves never to be found. Since you can get on the island only at towns or coves, by the time you do, they are too close to what I mentioned so they are gone. Also when you leave your ships, you and your crew will be on horseback. Horses on a pirate ship? Makes sense only when you remember it is Mount & Blade not a game using the same engine.\nGliches are plenty as well. Walk around town and talk to anyone, their image superimposes on your own or blanks out completely. At the sale price this can be overlooked, at full price you left scratching your head what the devs were thinking. Didn\'t they test such basic items before release?\nThen there are the bugs. I accepted an assignment to go to a cove to protect a shipment for a governor, fought off some attackers, and returned the governor for my reward. Abruptly I am being attacked, the daughter I supposed rescued? was suddenly there, and we were all killed. I\'m going who, what, where? Game over.\nSo for all these reasons I suggest getting it on sale otherwise wait until it is for it is not worth the full price as it currently stands.","May 31","true","27.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

You see them trying to scale cliffs and they run through rivers to get to you, but it's no biggie, right? Nothing a few arrows can't handle to deal with it.\n\nIn this game, however, the maps are highly intricate and have a feeling of verticality to them. There's multiple story structures; debris on the ground... TL;DR there's a TON of stuff for the AI to get stuck on. And what's worse, sometimes they spawn in areas even you can't get to, thus making battles and missions sometimes utterly pointless.\n\nThere's a lot of issues with this game. I've only played it for roughly three hours--enough time to amass a fleet and capture/govern my own little corner of the carribean, but in those three hours I've had to alt-f4 and/or replay missions so many times just to get anything done.\n\nUntil there's serious patchwork done to the game I wouldn't recommend it irregardless of how much or how little they charge you for it.

New missions, such as bodyguard, sabotage and assassination missions, are available. You can now walk around the well designed cities, and also play as female characters.\nThe naval battles are still as fun as they were before in Caribbean! and I haven't had enough experience yet with land combat to offer a conclusive report on that.\n\nSo far, there's just an overwhelming amount to do. Snowbird have really stepped it up and given us the game that Caribbean! should have been from the start.

You keep visiting the same tavern and keep fighting in the same battlegrounds over and over again, which is very immersion breaking to me. Hope this is expanded upon.\n\nShip combat still seems too gamey, though it's a bit less clunky than before. Ship boarding action is much better, since not all troops spawn at once, so you get more running around the ship, climbing ropes, etc, which is a lot of fun.\n\nThe GUI is same ol' M&B, but when new bits were introduced they don't always work smoothly or are bugged. Renamed ships revert back to their original names everytime you go ashore, scrolling through your troops resets to bottom each time you click, etc.\n\nYour companions tend to just disappear sometimes, without you being told whether they were killed in combat, deserted, were captured or went down with a ship. Quests are just declared failed after you clicked on a couple conversation options without really knowing why. This feels unfinished and unintuitive.\n\nPerformance is quite terrible for me. I can run M&B Warband: Viking Conquest on max graphics and have battles with several hundred troops, but can only run Caribbean on the most basic graphic settings and still only get framerate of about 30 (not anymore, see Edit).\n\nI haven't yet given up on this game, because I am desperate for a good pirate game, so I'll keep hoping it improves, but still have to compare this game to the ancient game Pirates of the Caribbean with the New Horizons mod, which captured the same spirit, but just did it a lot more credibly (http://www.moddb.com/mods/new-horizons), particularly the sea combat.\n\nIf I gave the original Caribbean! 2/10, because it seemed just too broken, I give Blood&Gold: Caribbean! 5/10 (upped to 6/10 after Edit) and just barely recommend it as it just doesn't deliver the full potential of pirating fun it could.\n\nEdit:\nAfter manually adding the game in the NVidia panel, the performance is ok. 80fps at max graphics. Strange though that this game doesn't recognise the graphics card, while M&B Warband does automatically.\n\nI guess I can bump the score to 6/10 and will likely increase more once they fix the bugs, the gamey feeling of sea combat and other loose ends.","December 12, 2015","true","29.0"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","3"

They have changed a lot since my last one. But is it for good or for worse..?\n\n-You can play as female now and even get married (quest) but do not do this cause, your wife will hate you and there is no way to gain her favor after marriage...it steadily declines over the weeks. Giving her a town to rule, might boost it a bit, but giving her the world is not really in the marriage deal is it..? And all the ladies look a like my first fat ex girlfriend, no matter which way you slide the bars or change the skins or eye colour.\n\n- You can still use R look at your mast during seabattles! Superb!\n\n- They have added mountains, coves and lagoons. And you will leave your ship(s) behind now on the place where you disembarked. So no more crosscountry toiling with your ships in your backpack. They also use supply trains and explain it very nice... with a wall of text... which disappears not only when you press backspace...but also within 2 seconds...you can look it up at gameconcepts so it's a minor irritation, but one that nags me, why they bothered to summon that wall of text anyway...\n\n-Changing your weapons, takes about a second, while your oponent fires his gun at you, switches to melee in a blink an eye, parries and attacks, before  switching back to his newly reloaded gun to fire it again...in that freaking second you just switched yours...and you are up against 20 of them!\n\n- They removed the icons for the siege ladders and you can scale them now on your own....if you get through the murderous cannonfire. And hey! you guessed it right, the cannons you own are not there...really handy...no siege weapons during a siege... On the other way around you have no guns on your fort during a siege while they have theirs placed nicely outside your walls! Best way to win a siege is now is getting a fluyt with the extra cargo, load it with grain and wait about 3 months and hope they surrender(Honestly I had never seen them surrender and still had to fight after the siege was concluded, what use is a siege if you going to assault it anyway?) Ohw you can also assault them by boat now...perfect! If you like dripfeeding your men to the slaughter!\n\n- They added some quests, some which are very funny, like killing a few officers as native but most are very frustrating: Like the one to set 8 boats on fire: They allow you, your own sword but not your guns...so as shooter you are proper f*cked. Ok, they give you some lousy thugs with guns, which they not use and start dancing behind the other thugs but fire no shots at all. Then an army of guards arrives to stop you...on horses and with guns.(you cannot mount or pick up the horses or the guns the guards drop) Best way to do this is take a high athletics and run for it..once in the 3 or 4 tries and you'll make it.\nThen there is a battery under assault quest, if you just started the game and you still have colonists in your army...your are f*cked...then every shot have to count...4 waves with 75 elites against your 40 colonists...you can do the math. But once you killed around 250 of them, your art. skill has leveled from zero to 300+ Still you need those last 50(which I managed by riding circles around the ramparts and killed them one by one...)\n\n- Still...the commanding/map(backspace) are on a battlemap but are not there while you need them the most... on the ships, sieges or quests...so again or still your soldiers march up the masts through a larger group of pikemen to get to whatever they never going to be...\n\n- You have put the J**k *ff from the siege ladders icons on the pathfinding didn't you? Cause he f*cked it up! On the world map I see several ships trying to get lose from a bay or cove. And the "move here"  will get you stuck on small(invisible) corners. On the battlemaps soldiers get stuck on whatever they can find to get stuck on with...tents, campfires, cannons and even horses. And for the glacing on the cake ...only your soldiers will get stuck!\n\n-You can walk around in towns now, but infrastructure all look the same and you cannot talk with the inhabitants(yet?) But at least I can lordly ride around my town now.\n\n-Upgrades on your ship are still not shown, nor cannons(and still you can not change cannons between ships) Also there is not difference between a battle or normal version of a ship, only stats...\n\n- All your men still talking English whatever your men are Spanish, Dutch, French or not...again GoT mod for M&B had even dolthraki screaming... And they never going to be rich...not now not ever, they get killed before that if you do not take a high surgery.\n\n-Then I found a new one...a huge one imo. Historical accurancy...fire an arquebus on a horse, arque means hook...You have to place a stick upright in the ground to use it properly. Yes there were sadle versions or better hookahs used on camels and elephants... but not on horses, you aren't able to pivot it around the horse it's head.)\nMatchlocks fire with a greater accurancy and in the rain then flintlocks(faster reloading too)\nAxeguns and maces were very very very rare while a swordgun was very common. And you do not have to switch between firing mode. They worked very well, you put the pointy end in some agressive person, didn't he died from it, you pulled the tricker...thats how they worked. Please do some research on the weapons...\n\nThen the characters, while the famous Michiel de Ruyter was working for the WiC he never went to the carribean, his son  Engel did but Michiel died when his son was an infant...\n\nBut it's getting better...still not good enough...","April 5","false","33.3"," 26 of 48 people (54%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","54","26","48","9","3"

Ive been playing M&B variations for years and this is the first on that i am forever alt+tabbing to google. Seriously! Is wood & timber the same thing ? If it is not why the hell would you put timber & wood in the same game! If it is then why is my quest not being accepted. Considering this is their second release I really expected more.\n\n*Turns out they have... They included timber & wood in the same game, smh...\n\nSomehow they've managed to make the combat even clunkier than Warband, not sure if i should be impressed or not...\n\nIf you like to control you troops, turn away from this game. You cant hold down the F1 key to tell your troops where to go, you cant tell them to stand closer, which is much needed for pikeman. Formations simply do not exist. The only improvement is being able to control you men on the battle view map but its highly inaccurate. You try getting you men up on a hill with that screen! Seriously could of been a great game... Why take away the basic features from Warband by all means add but dont take away important features!\n\nOn the plus side the missions are actualy enjoyable unlike Warband and ever other variation there has been, so well done on that front just sort the combat out!!!!\n\nThe biggest problem the dev has, is implenting new features before old ones are fixed. The combat should be your first priority in any M&B game period. It appears to be laziness but the truth is the dev's aren't lazy, they are simply over committing. As soon as the dev's sort the combat out, all of the other issues become very minor and I would be more than happy to change my review.\n\n\nTLDR:\nPros\nMissions are fun (astonishing for a M&B game!)\nBoarding ships is awesome\nNot like any mod of M&B ive played before\nAny ship boarded you can keep\nIm not much of the trading type but that looks a lot more interesting than normal M&B's\n\nCons\nTaken out very important features\nStill feels like an Alpha\nCommanding your troops is futile\nAfter alot of naval combat, I still don't know when your ship will fire. I end spamming the space key until the ship shoots\nLimited troop variation\nHave to hunt the governors/lords down\nYou don't keep weapons/horses picked up in combat\nEnterprises dont auto pay, you have to pick the goods up a sell them yourself (this could be a pro for some, but a pain for me)\nBayonetted weapons swing rather than stab (COME ON NW has alreadly done this for you!!)\nMP nothing needed to be said on this just WOW\nIf you jump & attack at the same time your man just holds his sword in the air\nTrying to get to another page in the trade menu is another nightmare, think my mouse will run out of clicks!\n\nI hope they solve the issues above because it does have potential, being the second release im not so sure.

Have you ever played as a merchant, then decided to raid instead of trade. If you answered yes to these questions, then play this. Is $20 so much of a a cost in a world of $60 games with $29.00 season passes?? I enjoy this game as a fun pirate simulator, trade simulation and a good time to relax after work. Is it 100% finished and polished, no, is it better than most of the greenlight, early access that never get updated titles steam is full of, yes. If you enjoy being able to build your own strategy for dominating the Caribbean, buy the game and enjoy.

It's like Port Royal mixed with total war and RPG style games. Be Good, bad or a bit a both. You are in charge of your own destiny in this game.

They've added multiplayer, new quests, new characters, and much more. Although it's not 100% historically accurate, the game does look quite nice!\n\nWhat I would suggest for a future update is:\n-to allow for the female character customization (nothing works with that)\n-more options for customization (hairstyles/beards, faces, etc.) + more realistic features\n-possibly add back in the backstory shpiel (when deciding the stats for your character)\n-add back a beginning quest\n-Perhaps even chosing a starting date?

Because it happen to loose fights in warband and of course there is consequences, But in this game you loose a fight you loose everything. Stripped of every possession you have. Kind of realistic but kind of break the gameplay if you made 1 slight bad judgement. I bought this on the Hype that it remind me of a game i use to play that involve trade and boats fights 15 years ago. Called pirate of the carribean. That combined with warband made me bought it without even watching video on youtube. It's not a bad game. Yet it is not exelent either. The character customisation is ♥♥♥♥. You want to have a pirate looking guy. There is just haircut you can go with. Maybe this game will have mods eventually... I certainly would love to. Also the recruiting system. I'm not quite sure how it works yet it ain't you go to a village and you recruit like warband.. Can't seems to find people to hire in tavern either. for now I do not recommend the game but I will keep playing to see if it was me or the game","January 13","false","24.2"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","0"

Save your cash and get a free mod to play for your M&B. Better yet, just wait for Bannerlords II like the rest of us. Maybe one day someone will make a decent pirate game, but I can tell you this isn't the day and sure as hell isn't the game. Sid's Pirates was a work of art for its time and for the misleading reviews that dared to say this game lives up to it, I hope you can live with yourselves... I'd say how bout you walk the plank in your crappy pirate fantasy land, but it will probably crash before you get to the end of the board.\n\nUpdate: 2016 01 13; So I decided to put another hour in at least... ended up being about 1.4 to be exact and I've still came to the same conclusion. If the game is working, it lags horribly at times where it kills the moment and although some of the missions are well written, the scripts often fail to work. Example, my last mission was to secretly win over a governors daughter so that I can fail his regime later on in the mission. I ended up saying something stupid (as expected of many men) and we ended up in a fight.... I guess? She tells me to surrender or die and than my character threatens her but we just stand in her room with no interaction.. can't leave, can't kill her, can't do anything. So I have to start over because I play every game realistic saves.... Not willing to start over. Comparable to Sid's Pirates.... hell no. Comparable to someone's first attempt at a mod for Mount and Blade... right on the damn nose.","January 12","false","2.4"," 13 of 24 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","13","24","0","0"

A couple of things ive noticed though, like there is no villages, or cities for the natives, i think it would be nice to engage there cities and raid them, but also some other suggestions. Also maybe a bounty board for notorius pirates with the pirates having high level ships and good men to make it a challenge. Also speaking of which, maybe adding a way to build your own base with resources and money, and a way to get settlers to them and establish your own faction without taking over a city. And maybe within that city you can have a Inventor, who can invent new weapons for you and different types of stuff. Like for example, an axe that is a part musket, similar to your creation the mace pistol, maybe he cant invent explosive tipped arrows but they will be highly costly and come in low quantities. And those are jsut my ideas, hopefully this will get liked enough for you all to see it. Thank you for your time and this amazing game, you all are doing a very great job.","January 22","true","19.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Although it runs rather slow on potato systems, the graphics are a great improvement over Mount and Blade.\n\nIf Caribbean was getting some mount and blade in Port Royale, this iteration is getting more mount and blade in Port Royale.  Tons of missions, more sandbox features like blackjack and barroom brawls.  There are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s if you're into micro-♥♥♥♥♥ style roleplay.  And there are guns and swords.  Really big ones.\n\nThe mission varieties here are much greater than the original game, with more mount and blade styled quests.  But to call them Mount and Bladeish quests is doing this game somewhat of a disservice.  It's still weird as you're completely unable to swim (Mount and Blade's engine is to blame for that, I'm afraid.), but they've pulled off some interesting missions here.\n\nIn short, if you didn't like Caribbean, you may not change your mind for this game.  Watch let's plays, look at other reviews and the feature list to decide if this game is for you before buying.  And ignore the minimum specs listed, the game may not run so well on them.  I can run it just barely at a steady 13 fps on my potato, but I don't know, your mileage may vary.  I wouldn't recommend this game as an impulse buy, as many pirate-styled games can be.

Newly captained and ready for anything she sets off, and is instantly attacked by pirates. Now, of course this is no issue for No-Beard, and she quickly managed to board the ship and get instantly knocked out by a musketeer. Luckily her crew was slightly less bullet-prone and captured the ship without her help.\nThis happened a few more times and she gained quite a bit of money, so she decided to put it into the bank... because that sounded like a good idea, and she spent the money that wasn't in the bank on repairs for the ships. Upon leaving the city for the open ocean, No-Beard spotted a group of smugglers, and that's pretty easy money. This time, however, something seemed off. The cannons weren't loading for some reason; I can't imagine why... Oh wait! I have no crew! How did that happen? Maybe all that grape shot.\nObviously, it's difficult to kill the entire crew by yourself without a counter button, so No-Beard is captured by the smugglers and sold into slavery on a plantation, which sorta sucks. Naturally she attempts to escape by herself, and is run over by a horse. After she convinces evey other slave to join her escape, two at a time, she sucesfully manages to escape with only twenty of the slaves being killed by the guards.\nPennieless and without a ship, she carefully heads back to a city to look for a job to make enough money to buy another ship, but the only job available is helping the french army cause panic for an excuse to wipe out the indigenous peoples. Meh, I have no morals. What I wasn't told is that the village me and an army will need to terrorize is on a different island, which sort of ruins my plan to use the money from the quest to buy a ship. But I have a bank account, don't I? Thank goodness I trusted most of my money with this random person I just met! Unfortunately I'm still about a hundred dollars short, so I end up literally selling the clothes off my back in order to afford the cheapest ship there is.\nAfter setting off and avoiding contact with every other ship like a navy run by reddit, No-Beard makes it to the camp near the village to prepare for a not-even-slightly morally grey murder romp. Fully prepped and dressed in a grass dress, I realize that they probably wanted me to bring the army myself to take out the town, considering I'm the only one there. Well I suppose I can just run awa... oh, I was shot. ♥♥♥♥.\nApparantly, getting nearly killed made my realtionship with the ♥♥♥♥ who gave me the job go way down. Naturally I'm on another ship on the way to another plantation, and either luckily, or un, Windows decided that this would be a great time to tell me to activate my key, and crash the unsaved game.\n\nI'd like to think I grew as a person from this experience, and being a slave gave me a new perspective on pixelated life.

B&G throws-in a lot of new concepts but there is very little in the way of content (so far). Factions feel less personalized: you can't interact with them as much. Troop trees take a little getting used to, all troops end up in either British, French, or Spanish.\nAs of writing this I have spent less then 10hrs playing because I couldn't find anything else to do but this game shows a lot of promie and I hope the Developers continue to work on it.\nP.S It is kinda buggy but nothing game breaking.","February 28","true","10.1"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Thank you developers....\n\n{Im truly a fan of the Mount & Blade.. but ive never seen such a patch job like this in the series. The game tries to have a theme like sid meier pirates with a copy and paste of the Mount and Blade engine. The bugs..even in this "new" version are  many...pathfinding of both troops movement on battlefield and movement on the world map is horrible. You click and point to move ahead and the pathfinding will have you enter a city not targeted...There is no transaction with any towns people but those in buildings and even half of them are just back drops...Im not sure what this game is trying to be... a cross between warband and Fire and Sword...(remember that follow up)...\nThose who purchased the first installment before this revision was burned by a game riddle with bugs...now with this new installment and those old reviews wiped clean...the developers are starting fresh with all new bugs in this latest version...\nYes fans who purchased the original say this is far bettter..but geeze...if this is better the other must have been unplayable....}\n\nEDIT: Okay people....I must revised this Review and give it a thumbs up....Why? Because these devlopers have been hard at work fixing this game (although this is there second time around and far out of beta). A new patch has been launched every 2-3 weeks and they have been making a huge impact on the game play... Pathfinding working closer to perfection and the they are working on the balance and eco. of the game....Keep up the good work..\nMy first review reversal im proud to change because of the fixes.....Thanks developers...\n\nUpdate Edit: I usually dont take time to revisit reviews Ive made in past unless a game is released beta..but this game has become truly a gem! The improvements and dedication to this game by its developers should be a bench mark to all developers of bring a game from just ok to excellent! Since my last edit in 2015 of decemeber which was a thumps up when I saw improvements,,,have become outstanding. I highly recommend this game to anyone who like Mount and Blade series or even a good pirate game like Sid Mirs....Great Job!","December 12, 2015","true","28.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","5"

M&B handles land combat wonderfully, but the ship battles are still extremely lacking. I wanted nothing more than for this game to take the place of Age of Pirates 2 (which has it's own flaws) but even being given this "updated" version for free for buying the original, I still regret buying the original. More specifically:\n\nShip handling is just awkward and unsmooth. It works fine at speed, but when moving slow, the ships twitch and jerk while turning. Visual feedback during combat is lacking. Unless on top of the other ship, it is almost impossible to tell if the shots hit (except for when chain knocks down a sail.)\n\nThe ship interfaces are awkward at best and was clearly scabbed onto the existing M&B interface. The town overviews are a nice attempt, but are bland and generic.\n\nAs in the M&B games, the ground combat excels and is good fun. Unfortunately ship decks are extremely cramped. While it may be realistic, it leads to fairly frustrating battles of just watching the crews fight because there is no way to get through the mobs to actually do anything.\n\nThe overworld map again falls short. Trying to move between locations often left my ship travelling at right angles. Instead of travelling in a straight line to the target, the letter "L" became a common occurance. I haven't moved like that in a game since the old NES days. To make it worse, the times it happened seemed to be frequent and random, but not every time, making it difficult to navigate. On top of that, the overworld map is just ugly. It's stuck in between two worlds. One being a high resolution, high color map, the other being really low quality ship and town icons. They completely clash against the map and the clash is visually hard to stare at.\n\nThere are many other issues and the game is unfortunately just fundamentally flawed. I apprecaite their attempt at trying to correct some of the major issues with the original version, this one still isn't really an improvement. Caribbean should have been it's very own game and not built on top of an engine that simply was not designed for it.","December 16, 2015","false","0.7"," 10 of 21 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","10","21","0","4"

First is the acknowledgement that, for someone who is accustomed to the Mount & Blade engine, it may be a completely different experience.  Second is the fact that, like all of us, I've been playing games for years now and generally know how they work.\n\nOk, so on to my experience.  So I start playing this game, and all seems well aside from the fairly steep learning curve.  I get a mission to relieve a besieged fort, which seems pretty basic at least in outline: go in, figure out how to kill the natives, and as an added bonus try not to die while doing it.\n\nThat's when things get bizarre.  First, there doesn't seem to be any way to control anything but my character.   That's fine, I think; given time I can figure out how that works.  There have to be tutorials somewhere, right?  Maybe there even are, but I didn't get that far because I got knocked unconscious by some native or other who was probably feeling slightly resentful about everything that was going on.\n\nKnow what happens next?  Nothing.  That's right, nothing, unless I had a stroke (which was unlikely since there was no smell of toast or facial numbness, but I still mention anyway in the interest of fairness).  I sat there and watched nothing because the battle moved on.  I controlled nothing because I was unconscious.  Unconsciousness implied the thoroughly mistaken hope that one day I would regain consciousness and maybe rejoin the battle, but that didn't happen either.\n\nThen it got even better.  There's no way to reload the game in battle... unless it's just THIS battle, which would put me square into the "get cancer twice then struck by lightning" unlucky zone.  Fine, hardcore whatever... but there's also no way to stop the game.  Seriously, there's no end game button, no return to main menu, no quit to desktop, no accessible game menu that changes anything but video/audio options,\n\nPlease, think about that for a second.  Your character is lying there.  There's no way to take control of anything else (I even employed desperation measures, which means looking at the keybind list one by one and seeing what each button does), no way to do anything at all in game, and no way to get out of the game except the nuclear option  of task manager.\n\nThe event was frustrating.  Google didn't help, nor did checking the official forums.  For me, it was a game breaking experience... although as always your mileage may vary... and one I don't care to repeat.\n\nThe game has a lot of potential, a very interesting premise, and for other people it sounds like it can be pretty fun.  For me, though, as soon as I hit post I'm heading to the hospital just to make sure it wasn't a stroke, because this seems like a pretty significant design flaw.\n\n\n\n\n","May 28","false","2.1"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","47","7","15","3","2"

I deleted saved games, checked integrity of files, but can't seem to fix it.  Help! [I just changed my review to negative based on this bug until it is fixed and I can play the game again.]\n- All the major pieces are here, however there are some pieces left out from Warband, such as sieging cities/forts, you can only assault them.\n- The menus get a bit tideous at times, e.g., it would be nice to be able to move troops you purchase from the garrison directly to the fort and not have to transport them back and forth through the main character's company.\n- I have to redistribute crews before reaching port and I can fill my ships from the other ships easily. I understand there should be a certain minium sized prize crew to sail a ship (one is laughable, but you allow it), but the others I should be able to more easily move to my depleted crews on my core ships.\n- the little plus sign doesn't show up on the list of crew when you click their button on the Party screen, this is annoying, having to search through each to find which ones advanced during battles, and who is the screen so small? Why not just use the regular crew/party screen?\n- Another item basic to all mount and blade games that is missing is that you can't choose which "captives" you freed to bring into your company, it automatically chooses the weakest captives, from what I can tell. I could understand certain nationalities based on faction not joining, but... this sucks as it currently stands.\n- If you play as a pirate it would be fun after sea battles to be able to recruit sailors from defeated crews) or impress them if you are British, etc.).\n- The sea battles seem a little simplistic, they never seem to vary from head on encounters. And there is no way to command your other ships other than to anchor them. Needs work.\n- There is a very minor bug that caused a crash right after start up before I did anything (happened twice, no negative effect either time).\n- The game seems to be a little laggier than latest Warband.","February 14","false","48.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I have never played a War Band game because from the quick glances I had seen of it, it looked dated frankly. I was wrong. Im a big fan of Pirate/Sailing/RPG games so I bought this on a whim and it has blown me away. The developers have put so much care into crafting the world and adding so many little details and activities to do. The game feels so vast and bigger than your avatar and I constantly find new details, missions, and areas. There is a deffinite sense of exploration and adventure captured here.\n\nMy only complaint would be that I have played it so much that I wish their where more combat maps, partincularly for the capturing of cities. However this is obviously something they are working on and just today they released a free DLC contianing more city maps. It is a fantasticly detailed game and snowbirdgames is updating it continually, plus the steam workshop is now open for it. It is fantastic now, I cant wait to see how much better it is a month and a year from now.","March 12","true","49.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

You have no idea how hungry I am for a good pirate game. But this isn't it. If you've never played Mount & Blade before, you're just screwed from square one, because this game doesn't have a tutorial for how it works on a basic level. If I hadn't played a bit of Warband I would have been lost right from the get-go, instead of lost shortly after the get-go.\n\nThe interface is a nightmare, with zero polish of any kind. Nothing makes sense. The UI presentation is total amateur hour, though I'm not sure how much of that is the fault of the shoddy Mount & Blade engine. The few text boxes of explanation that the player does get disappear before I had time to even read half of them, and I am a fast reader.\n\nEven the quickest jaunt into the game world makes it feel dead. There's no interaction with townspeople, so far as I can tell, making them the sparse window dressing to an already sparse design.\n\nThere might be some kind of quality game underneath the mountains of crap, and maybe some may find it worthwhile to dig through it all, but the average person will simply not enjoy this game.","January 3","false","1.6"," 14 of 30 people (47%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","47","14","30","2","0"

We all know that shallows were very important for the pirates as they were one of the ways that they could escape from warships. The sloops, especially the bigger ones, are underestimated. Sloops were the primary ships of pirates, and the way they are represented in the game, unless you have a sloop yourself or a cutter, you have nothing to fear as a merchant from the pirates with that kind of ship in this game. Sloops are fast, maneuverable, have decent amount of cannons for their size and are quite dangerous in the hands of pirates. Also, they can go where no warships can go making it easy for them to sail away.\n\nWhen you are boarding a ship or you are being boarded, the ships should be a bit bigger, and the amount of masts you have on each ships should reflect the amount of mast you have on each ship, not a default arena where people kill each other. If my ship has only one big mast, then there should be only one big mast. There is lots of work to be done here. Also, I want the ships to be as big as the ship I am boarding with, if I am using a sloop, then it is as big as a sloop with one mast, if I am boarding with a trimast corvette or three-decker then three mast plus big deck. I also want to have my entire load of men to attack not just a dozen or twenty. If I have a 100 men on board, I want a 100 men to assault the other ship. Otherwise I lose men uselessly by doing that silly 20 vs 20. I want a gauge like in Mount & Blade that tells the game how many guys I want on the map for each side.\n\nTaking the Mount & Blade system into the Carribean is a good idea, but the designers should have put more time into research of the period and what made a pirate good at what he does as well as putting more time into coding. Graphics are unimportant as you have seen in Mount & Blade. M&B's graphics were ordinary, but the game was awesome. So build on that.\n\nOh yeah, add shallows where warships cannot enter without taking damage.\n\nAlso, I've noticed that no matter what the shape of your ships are in your fleet, you do not slow down on the world map. Sorry but that makes no sense. I captured a ship that had basically no masts or sails left and I was still moving at top speed on the the world map. In reality, a fleet moves at the speed of the slowest ship you have in it.\n\nAnother thing, when you sell a ship you should be able to keep and transfer its crew to your remaining ships, it's silly to always buy the damn guys over and over again because you sent some onto ships you have captured for sailing it back to port.\n\nTrading is possible, although there should be like a logbook that your character writes into when he finds a milk run so that you can remember easily. But you would need to discover it. Like buy rum in town A and sell it in town E. Or maybe some guy in port that you can pay and he tells you where you can sell for a profit the merchandise found in this town. Or do like the old Mount & Blade and assess the market by using time instead of money and it would be evaluated according to your merchant skill.\n\nI like the game, and recommend buying it for people who likes pirate/sea games and Mount & Blade. But it requires lots of tweaking still.","February 10","true","6.3"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","1"

I'm a M&B fan and looking forward to bannerlord. But this one is pure crap. I mean seriously, they can't even get the rules right for for stupid blackjack minigame. Ace's count for 11 OR 1 how freaking hard is that to figure out?\n\nThe missions you can do they attempted to balance by forcing weapon loadouts and ignoring the equipment and troops what you've spent your money on. Even then they are terribly balanced, in most cases success comes down to pure luck of how well the thugs it gives you survive.\n\nThere is no way to escape from sea combat, so if you get pulled into it early on with the beginner ship then you might as well surrender. But worse then that was the fact there were no connon sounds the first time I got into one, none at all unless the volume for those sounds is about 300% less then regular sound levels.\n\nThe devs did well with M&B and I hope 2 is even better, but this game they don't deserve any money for.

Somthing about the balence of solid battles and interesting devolpment(if not time consuming). Fire and Sword, also great game, awesome mods, too many random headshots IMHO, but still good. Napoleon? I will be the best battle flautest you have ever seen. Vikings, say no more, I'm sold.\n\nSo imagine my excitement about another addition to the game I have readily spent so much time on.  I like the new systems brought about in Caribbean(keep in mind this was before the new moniker Blood & Gold), building and growing your favorite habours is nice for a strat-buff like me. The new-ish skills fit the theme, although it had alot of personal skills(hard to make a jack-of-all-trades). So, starting out after my introduction to the world, I hop in my boat and charge at the first enemy I see. One boat, only 7 men, this is going to be easy.  We started pretty far away from one another so I speed up the most I can and sally forth! As I start making some angle changes my my ship starts listing to the side, I figured I was going too fast so I slow down.  That seemed to make things worse, as I continue to turn, my ship goes lower and lower into the water until I end up under. Now I think my crews all dead, BUT WAIT! HERE COMES MY SHIP AGAIN! ITS ALIVE! Wait...no....there it goes again. Eventually I end up spinning so fast it just stops moving forward. weeeee!\n\n\nI tried it a few more times but the same thing happened, and you know what? Thats ok, some time there are bugs, I'll wait.\n\nSix months pass.\n\nI saw B&G pop up on my list of owned games, and found out what it was. Started it up with hopes of long and enjoyable pirate adventure. Made my easy warrior char, read the new info, bought myself and expensive pistol and bullets.  I shoot off attacking the first ship again as is my MO.  Ships and set up look familiar, lets shoot us some pirates.  I move towards the foe, speeding up the ship, start to adjust to fire at him angle looks good, FIRE! I think I got him but I'm not sure its hard to tell what happens to my cannon balls after they leave my ship. change my angle again so I can flank him and try to blast him away.....and there goes my ship under the water again.....and again.... and wait....no....no now I can't move.\n\n\nI would love to play this game, really I would. But it won't let me. I would recommend it, but it won't let me. Good luck to those it works for.","February 26","false","0.7"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

Played 64 minute and i tryed to play as a merchant. So all i can say is merchant is badly implemented. Intro is confusing, it say that you purchased stuff to sell in hispaniola, look on map there is no area named that, go in quest tab and see that there is a tab with town listing and see no town named that. So you think that maybe it's a faction so you check faction name still no luck. So i finally sold the stuff to a random town without knowing what they usually go for. Tryed to find a way to assess the market but found no way. So i tough ok i will try a bit of fight to see how it goes. Fought a ship and we turned around each other for 15 minute firing at random (Dont think my shot was landing but it was night and i had merchant skill and ship build so that might explain it.)\n\nSo in short: Game is not built for trading. Might be good for fighting but i like to build an empire in those kind of game so if merchant part is screwed it's not fun for me.","April 1","false","1.1"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","0","0","3","2","0"

Character creation menus have no back and forth option, and while assigning skill points you can't take away ones you put on. Only reset the entire thing. Character appearance options are severally limited, control options are limited. I can't even turn the vibrate off on my xbox controller which is always hooked up to my pc. The quests are either poorly guided or just poorly implemented. Went to burn down some ships in a wharf. Throw torches on the deck, no fire. Tried to throw them on the bags of ammo, no fire. Ran around the ship looking for a "push f to light" nothing.\n\nI'm sure there's a very simple way to complete it. But you either need to tell your player base how to do it, or make the game more accepting of simple solutions like throwing a torch. The merchant menu is difficult to use if you aren't buying hundreds of items at once. It's a slider bar instead of an arrow click, or numerical input or the combination of both an arrow push/slider bar for precision. Obviously it's usable but not user friendly.\n\nSome pluses for the game. The combat system is fun. Probably funner than the original mount and blade. The ship combat is very well done. It's not a slow and tedious chasing of ships like other ship games. The combat options also give you the option of firing cannons from the starboard or port sides or from the stern independantly. Boarding ships is the same combat as regular mount and blades melee.\n\nAll in all the game has potential as I said in the start. But severally lacks user friendly polish. Unless your really dedicated to this type of gameplay I'd wait.","December 28, 2015","false","1.0"," 4 of 12 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","4","12","0","3"

Sounds awesome in theory, but in practice, not so much.  Most of the combat happens on ships, which are too confined and claustrophobic to do any of the fun Mount and Blade stuff like ride your horse through ranks of archers.  This is a more unpleasant shortcoming than it might sound like, because tons of seemingly cool ideas like the ability to climb up riggings to the crow\'s nests just turns into unmanageable blocking and failed swings in the elbow-room-ranges you constantly find yourself in.  Even the handguns aren\'t that great because you really have to be careful not to hit your own troops.  (The ship-to-ship combat is fun enough--but also way too similar to the Sid Meier\'s Pirates remake.)\n\nSo, a thumbs down and I\'m sad to say it.  The sad fact is that if you want piratey goodness, the Sid Meier\'s Pirates remake is still a ton of fun for the sawbuck gamer and Assassin\'s Creed 4 is great for the top-shelf folks.  And if you just want more Mount and Blade of any kind (which, there\'s already tons) you can buy Victory at Sea or even just play the Star Wars: Conquest mod for free on the first game.","May 31","false","3.2"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

So close to being decent.\n\nI really enjoy a lot of the ideas and mechanics in this game much more so than just the original Caribbean! Which has apparently been removed from the Steam store, which is a slightly sad sight to see that instead of trying to make one good game, they just removed the bad one and placed a new one on the market in hopes of removing all the negative feedback from the first interation.\n\nAs I said, although there are plenty of RPG mechanics that I like. I like the town system, I like upgrading ships, I like making choices, conquering towns. It's all great. But this leads me to the things I hate.\n\nIncredibly long load times between places. Sometimes the game will just freeze because you're just trying to load your next spot. I really don't know how the game can have such light graphics and relatively small rooms but has such long load times. This is really a barrier to enjoying the game because you will constantly be switching from place to place just to do one thing and to be halted by a 10 second load time between each 30 seconds of gameplay you do. This is the reason why I currently do not recommend this game.\n\n*Update* I just read a list of things they want to add to the game, and they didn't even mention anything about character design. One of the most barebone parts of the game.\n\n*Update 2* I got a comment saying that maybe the problem is my computer, I initially laughed at the idea because all of the other mount and blade games and mods run just fine on this same computer but to be fair I decided I would give them a chance. I reduced all options down to their lowest settings and the same exact  problems are still there. The only positive thing I can say is that the load times went from 10 seconds to 6 seconds. So I guess the tagline for this game should be "40% better on low settings!"","December 11, 2015","false","3.1"," 15 of 36 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","15","36","0","1"

I look to the forums for help to find that many others had this but no solution was found. I went to the link the Devs suggested in one of there post. Took me to a forum page that has been around as long as windows 98!! Come on this game supposely was released end last year.\nOk so only thing in the forums I found was that I am not the only one with the issue. No it is not my rig it is more than enough for this game by 5x's over. Turns out that playing in windows mode solves this. Not bad if you dont mind that.\nSo I get in game finally and it looks so much like what I think is Port Royal with outdated graphics (all settings as high as I can get them)\nIts not over!!!
