The collision feels sketchy at best, there's no key remapping or controller support, and I've had to reload saves from inadvertently breaking the story just from exploring places I "wasn't supposed to go" and in a genre about exploration that is a pretty big flaw.\n\nIt has nice art and an OK soundtrack though, someone obviously cared a lot about the art style which is a hell of a lot more than I can say for most indie devs but in this instance, it isn't enough to abate frustration.\n\nIncidentally, this isn't the only platformer I've played that was designed in MMF2 and it actually has a lot of similar collision issues with several other games. I suspect the reason is because they all pull from the same tutorial and resources which I have personally investigated and found lacking in any capacity besides education because you cannot build an engine with the popular platformer tutorials in MMF2 or CF2.5 that has more advanced terrain than squares and I would advice anyone trying to make a platformer in MMF2 to either broaden their search for education or consult with veterans on engine polish.","April 27, 2015","false","0.8"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","17","20","0","0"

Which is not a bad thing, but, honestly I was intrigued by the concept of a 70s distopia, only to find that this is more a case of not using the word correctly. This game *is* quite a good example of "zeerust" though, (the particular kind of datedness which afflicts things that were originally designed to look futuristic) but not distopia.\n\nThe big problem with this game is that it's an action-puzzle-platformer that just doesn't have enough action, puzzles, or platforms. It's just not engaging enough. Mostly, the game involves walking, jumping, and doing obvious actions to obvious objects. The story-line is bare-bones, which would be fine, if the rest of it was strong, but it's not. In a lot of ways, it reminds me of Teslagrad, but Teslagrad does everything better.\n\nILIKESCIFI, if you read this, you've shown that you can make a professional-level game. I'm not sure I would have released this as a commercial product, despite the love you've put into it. But I do hope that you try again. Watch Extra Credits, and try again. :)","December 9, 2014","false","6.8"," 23 of 33 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","23","33","0","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrluchador/recommended/305740/","mrluchador","Chris","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrluchador/","1587 products in account","Pitiri 1977 is a fun, little platform game that mashes together the love for retro gaming, scifi and metroid.\n\nIn short, you run and jump, and gain powers to use to solve basic puzzles to advance through the story. Perhaps I'm writing this too soon after finishing the game, as I did enjoy what I played but it was over far too quickly. I think I must have done it in 90 minutes or so without really trying.\n\nThere isn't much to explore within the maps, so even when I went back to see if I had missed something it didn't appear as though I had. However... I still enjoyed it. It has a certain level of charm that can only be achieved by the developer's love for what they're doing.\nAll the art assets have been hand-drawn and put into the game, the animation reminds me of some of the cartoons I watched growing up, and there's just a sense of 'Child's Dream' to it all. It might not be for all, but it worked for me; mixed together with the soundtrack and the sci-fi references, I found myself smiling.\n\nThe controls are very basic, and exclusively use the keyboard's arrow keys for movement. So at times it can feel a little 'old school' by nature (and maybe by design). There are no option settings too, so you'll have to make do with the default volume levels (or change them in your control panel setup if too loud).\n\nOnce you complete the game you get to unlock Sandbox mode, which allows you to create your own levels - so I look forward to those in the future.\n\nI think I preferred the Alternative Ending.\n\nIn shorter short: Short game with a high degree of charm.","November 12, 2014","true","2.7"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","14","18","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/305740/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","There's something to be said for "big" twists being a lot harder to pull off than they're given credit for.\n\nIt's easy to see them as easy narrative devices to attempt to shock the audience into thinking something is smarter than it may actually be by completely disproving what they thought to be true and being a convenient focus point to write towards. But that's only because they're so often done poorly or telegraphed so well that they're no longer fit to be called twists at all. Pitiri 1977 goes in a somewhat different but no less flawed direction and simply writes its entire plot as a series of twists.\n\nEvery event save the mundane and far too long encounters with random robots is setup as something that's intended to be revelatory, but comes off as dull and meaningless. There's so little in the way of word building or character that a narrative almost doesn't exist until it wants to be in your face trying to blow your mind, when all I wanted was for it to go away and quit pretending it was so much more interesting than it was. The tonal differences in its writing also makes it hard to feel even the smallest bit connected to the world you're in, full of references that fall flat and the running joke that everything just reminds your character of a sci-fi movie they saw which was tiring the first time I heard it.\n\nThere's also the issue of how badly gameplay mechanics are attempted to be integrated into the game, gaining items at access point inexplicably placed around the ship for who knows what reason and solving bizarre puzzles that border on complete incomprehensibility. It's definitely a video game and it wants you to know, but it's also a pretty rubbish one, clunky and tedious with no sense of pacing and some really weird technical issues.\n\nI wasn't sure what to make of Pitiri 1977 for most of the hour I spent with it, but there's very little to make anything out of that isn't immediately forgettable in all its monotonous glory. It's an odd experience with no direction that somehow manages to feel at least three times as long as it is, which I guess is its one saving grace: that it's over before it becomes truly exhausting, though it's a close call at that.","January 21, 2015","false","2.2"," 22 of 36 people (61%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","61","22","36","2","0"

The plot, is pretty much on par with what I would expect from a side scroller. It's not too shabby, in fact if this were a star rating system I would give it 2 and a half....maybe 3 out of 5.\n\nUnfortunately, the game doesn't feel finished. There's no settings, so you can't adjust music/sound, you can't remap keyboard controls, which sucks cause it uses arrow keys instead of ASWD. No controller or mouse support. It just lacks WAY to much for a finished product to actually "Recommend".","July 19, 2015","false","1.1"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

So, that and music and art created a nice overall impression.\n\nPitiri is a lovely game suitable both for adults and children. It inspired me and showed me a lot of good things that could be done with its engine. And I'm glad that I have another game to offer to my little goddaughter.\n\nOverall rating: 8/10","June 25, 2015","true","4.0"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

It has quite a unique art style, and the environments look great.\n\n- The text speed is really slow. You will quickly get impatient waiting for characters to finish talking. Pressing buttons doesn't speed up text, it just skips entire lines of dialog, so that isn't really an option\n- The platforming is really clumsy. Even if you've played a lot of platformer games in the past, you'll fall off ledges, miss jumps, and generally get very annoyed at the controls.\n- Not much happens in the first 30 minutes. You get few characters to talk to, a few signs to read, a few powerups and some frustrating platforming action.\n\nI'm sure there's an interesting story underneath, but I just can't get past the annoying gameplay.","January 11, 2015","false","0.5"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","9","15","0","0"

The lovely visual style and music integrate well with the retro theme portrayed in the story and you can feel all the love and hard work that went into this indie game. Although the story is not incredibly innovative it sufficiently rounds off the neatly designed levels with their enjoyable puzzles. I liked the open design of the world (although it confused me a little on two occasions) because it puts the games focus towards character progression. Since you will continously unlock new abilities the game never gets boring and being a completionist I did my best to collect all the triangles...although I never found out what they actually do.

The devs have said they have no time, since October of 14... Perhaps sooner, I didn't dig enough into the forums to see how long ago people were complaining about it.\nThey added windowed support... after a fashion. I can't move the window. It's stuck in the center of my screen. Might as well have left it full screen.\n\nThere is little instruction on how your various powers work, and sometimes you can get lost in spots if you don't see something, but overall, the game is highly entertaining for an hour, till you beat it.\n\nThere is also a sandbox mode so you can create your own levels, but that seemed to be more effort than it was worth... at least for me.\n\nWhere I have issues is the price. I know they just dropped the price to $4, and I understand that they spent a lot of time, working on the beautiful levels, and the music, but the game is extremely short. I'd recommend this game for a lower price personally.\n\nOh, and the game DOES have trading cards, even though the store page doesn't list them. 3 card drops. Devs never updated it?\n\nOverall, I'd still give the game an 7 out of 10.\nSeeing as how short it is, you can last without controller support, but it does make it less fun.","August 9, 2015","true","2.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Why do so many developers neglect to include volume control?! It's a simple thing that makes ALL THE DIFFERENCE.\n\nAhem. The first time you pick up one of those triangle things, the game doesn't even attempt to give you time to read what your character says about it. The text bubbles just whisk right on by. The controls are pretty simplistic and don't allow very tight control of your character.","December 27, 2014","false","1.0"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","2","8","0","2"

This was after several hours of play. Even when I restarted from my saved game, the bug persisted, preventing me from progressing. Uninstalled.

I did enjoy playing the game.\n2. Sci-fi setting was good but not great\n3. The puzzles were very simple but decent enough\n4. The ending was cool but nothing amazing\n\nCons:\n1. Swimming was horrendous\n2. Gameplay was very clunky\n3. Art style wasn't very special\n4. Very short\n5. Very easy, almost to the point of feeling useless\n\nI'm not sure why I enjoyed this game, despite its many flaws. It was probably because it was so short that I didn't have to put up with all its shortcomings. Don't expect too much from this one.","November 6, 2015","true","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
