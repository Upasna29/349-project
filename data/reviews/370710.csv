That previous sentence essentially summarizes everything you will expect to experience from this game. The combat, the map, the controls, the menus and even the story seem like your standard fare that anyone with moderate competence in RPGmaker could put together. The options are limited to nonexistent and the depth or personalization or "role playing" is limited as well. Normally I abstain from incorporating price into a review for a game, however I feel for this game it is appropriate, even despite its cookie cutter appearance and a story which lacks originality, the game can still be an enjoyable experience, and it is served up as a cheap/budget title that runs the price of around a cheap hamburger. Relative to that, it is much more filling, it offers a story, that will offer some entertainment from its experience, that is why I recommend it.\n\nNotes:\nI played more of the game in offline mode,  hours tracked only when online.\nAlso for those who don't know Alt + Enter brings the game to fullscreen, worth mentioning.","November 13, 2015","true","8.2"," 43 of 54 people (80%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","80","43","54","7","0"

Standard RPG story, world threatened by crazy person you have to stop it by collecting item with powers.  Dialogue isn't the best there are spelling and grammar errors, that are pretty obvious.  At times conversations just comes off as clunky and to forced for a game that trys to act as serious as this one does.\n\nCharacter wise i find myself not connecting to much with any of them.  There is little moments at the start where you play as each but not much in it makes me CARE about them or get much of a backstory to why they are who they are.  3 hours in and I would like to have a favorite character but really I don't.  If any of them killed over at this point I don't think I would really care all that much.  King is a good guy whose morally sound but very little is fleshed out with him other than his reluctance to be king.  Rough around the edges woman who likes to fight, likes to fight. Deadbeat theif and a girl raised in a small town who can use magic round out my party at this point.  There are little things here and there to give a little more backstory but I can't for the life of me say they made me grow attach to them.\n\nGrinding up your level is difficult because once you clear the dungeon you have to leave completely for it to reset, no leaving a room and coming back to reset it.  I did have to grind for the first boss I encountered and it was a pain seeing as there are no over world encounters either.\n\nI get this is an rpg maker game that sells normally for $1.99, and thus not a high budget game, thus i shouldn't be that hard on it. Still the fact that they just seem to use recycled sprites and those points listed above, leaves me with the feeling they just didn't CARE about this world or the story they were crafting. It's obvious they have made other games just from reading the discription to this one, so it can't be said that they are new to this. There is very little creativity put into the area's you travel and other than hunting down treasure chest, there is very little incentive to explore the world and form any kind of attachment to it.  Perhaps if i played it a bit longer I would change my mind but honestly I just don't feel the need to put the effort into leveling characters in a world that I feel no attachment too at this point.\n\nIf your going to buy it, pick it up on sale like I did i wouldn't drop the normal purchase price for it.","December 2, 2015","false","3.1"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","14","16","0","0"

The king's brother is angry he wasn't crowned king and now wants to take control of four powerful relics so that he can rule the world. Your "unlikely" group of peope - the king, a magician, a thief, and a knight - will journey through dungeons trying to retrieve said relics before the angry brother can.\n\nThe title is fairly short (3-5 hours), and the dungeons all feel the same (perhaps because the majority of the dungeons in the game you go through twice). Enemies don't respawn, meaning you can't grind. Some enemies drop orbs so that you can buff stats, but since enemies don't respawn, you can't grind them. Not all of the chests refill when you make your return visits either.\n\nI have a hard time finding a reason to recommend Last Heroes. The game is plagued with spelling and grammar errors, and there are some really cheap strategies you can use to beat all of the bosses (including the final boss). There are better RPGMaker titles out there, so unless you really want something that is short and basic, then give this game a pass.","January 4","false","7.4"," 14 of 21 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","14","21","0","0"

One brother is the game's hero (Viktor) and king of the land, another (Viper) has nefarious plans to unseat the hero by finding 4 relics that will give him the power he needs, and the third is reluctantly in the middle of the conflict.\nThere are other characters rounding out Viktor's group as they set out to find the relics first so the land will be safe. A simple enough beginning to a story that expands as you go. And you do go to many places to hunt down the relics ---- all with their treasures to find, secrets to discover, and enemies to battle.\nEnemies do not reappear, so you can't level up by repeatedly fighting ---- instead, you have to carefully manage the money, items, weapons, spells, etc. that you gather along the way.\nAnd, as you let the story unfold, it draws you in bit by bit.\n\nOriginally released some time ago, the graphics and music hold up nicely, and you will soon enough find yourself absorbed in the task of seeing what happens next, who is allied with who and why, and finding out about the different characters' individual backstories. I'm happy to see this one arrive on Steam, and believe it to be an excellent addition to my rpg game library.","January 18","true","11.4"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

I found myself completing the game in around 3 hours of ingame time, mainly because I found an exploit. I won't say what the exploit is. I'll let you figure that out. I recommend that you pick this game up if you have a lot of free time and you need something to do. ;)","December 20, 2015","true","2.2"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

Yes, twice EACH.\nThe castle, OH THE CASTLE. You come back to it a hundred thousand times. You NEED to come back to it after every each mission as the main heroes.\nThen there's the dialogues. Pretty standard RPG dialogues go to along with the "fetch the relics to save the world" story.\nNot impressed at all, specially coming from Warfare and Aldorlea.\nI just played to the end, in the hopes the sequels are a bit better so I can give them a positive review...","May 28","false","7.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
