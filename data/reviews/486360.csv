I loved it, but it had its few flaws, but they can easily be overlooked. First off, its a short 30 minute game. This may seem bad to some, but I liked the experience, and I think it was worth the 5 dollars. The game relies on the unknown and jumpscares to scare you. For example, you are walking around, there is a weird little doll sitting out in the open, you approach, it dissapears. You turn around, and theres a creepy 2 legged "mouth" sprinting at you, as well as the alarming screen and noise effects. Many people dont like the jumpscare parts because they think it is "cheap." I disagree. The jumpscares keep you on your toes and keep the suspense throughout the game. Also, the game is unique. The "avant-garde" art style environments just make the game even more unique and scary! The game isnt "♥♥♥♥ your pants" scary, just, you know, scary. Its not a bad thing though, it was fun and thats what matters. Plus you get an axe! (I'm tired of running) In the end, the game is worth it, and a unique indie game.","June 4","true","0.2"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","8"

At the price point it is I do recommend.\n\nIt does gives a few jump scares, but if you are after any sort of story or depth to the game I would probably keep looking as I found myself asking wtf is going on pretty much from start to end.\n\nThe game does play well and it is what you would expect from any indie horror game. The graphics are pretty average and animations are sort of weird. For $5 though its hard to complain as I didnt encounter any bugs and did get a few scares.\n\nI have posted a full walk through above (or so I believe) as it doesnt really tell you if you have finished the game or not.","June 2","true","0.4"," 3 of 38 people (8%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","8","3","38","0","0"

YAY! haha\n\nPretty nice indie horror game. At first some of the mechanics in the game looked a bit weird (especially the way that axe moves) but oh well, it's an indie game and I'm happy that more and more indie developers get a chance to sell their production on steam.\n\noverall 7/10, but as it costs only 5 euro, I'd say it has good enough content for the price.","June 2","true","0.9"," 4 of 48 people (8%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","8","4","48","3","4"
