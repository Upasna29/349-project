Most of the time you're adventuring with punctuated periods of Hidden Object finding. The Hidden Object stuff is better than pixel-hunting as things are usually out in the open. When they're not, it's because you have to perform a series of actions to create the necessary object. (e.g. load a pistol with a bullet to fire it at a target so that you can pick up a "target with a bullet hole".)\n\nPerhaps the most interesting aspect is that some of the objects you find are important parts of the plot. This is MUCH more satisfying than your classic pixel-hunt nonsense that ultimately made adventure games so unpopular.\n\nThe story is chick-flick/romance clap-trap for teenage girls and lonely women, but if you can look past it you'll have some fun. You start in a space setting (fun!) but eventually move to a medieval setting after you "crash land". Again, just chillax, don't take it too seriously, and you'll have a good time.\n\nI got this game on sale and thought it was a fun way to waste five hours. You will probably enjoy this game if you're a huge fan of adventure games, hidden object games, a casual player trying to relax, or if you fit within the target female demographic. Anyone looking for an epic story or hardcore action should probably pass.","November 30, 2014","true","5.1"," 27 of 30 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","27","30","0","0"

It has a interesting sci-fi setting, some exploration of a derelict city and the difficulty is a little higher then typical for these kinds of games, which is refreshing. So far so good, a solid hidden object game.\n\nWhere the game however fails at is at the end or the lack of it. The story jumps all over the place and then the game just rolls the credits. A 3 second outro is all you get and plenty of questions stay unanswered. The game doesn't even do a good job of explaining the problem you are trying to solve in the first place. I don't expect a great story from a hidden object game, but this one really could have used some polish.\n\nSo overall, it was ok, but it left me with far to much of a "WTF, that's it?!" at the end.\n","April 19, 2015","false","4.5"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","14","15","0","0"

When something bad happened to her lover Steve, she's forced to espace into space where she crashes on another planet. And well, now, the countdown is activated because... a comet is coming straight at her.\n\nThe story is full of twists. I never expected to crash on the planet that was supposed to be destroyed soon. Also, while there are some plotholes, I can't complain. I mean, you're in an advanced base, then into a town that looks like being in a steampunk environnmenent, yet looking more like medieval and then in a destroyed city that is similar to a human city. So, I can't say that there is a problem in the graphics.\n\nThe problem lies in the fact that you don't know where to go. I mean, you know what to find but you don't know where. Despite the map, in casual, showing you where you have to go, sometimes, there is no indication. NO INDICATION! Because every scene isn't shown on the map, that's why! The kitchen or the princess's room aren't shown for example.\n\nAnd while I could do the majority of the puzzles, I've to skip some. Or I didn't understood what it needed from me, or I didn't see something because it wasn't clear or it was too "huge" like the scale in the tower with all these weights. And I found a terrible problem with the mold puzzle. I mean, I tried to put the item needed on it but it didn't work. I had to zoom on the chest in reality to find some mold on the wall like on the main screen. Why zooming when you can already do the work like that? The HO scenes aren't difficult, though it would have been great to have a better idea than put the text in black with effects. I had an hard time to read.\n\nSpace Legends isn't bad. It's just suffering from the puzzles. Only recommended to the hardcore gamers. I wish you had a middle ground button, because the game is barely passing the positive review (I enjoyed it - that's why I put a thumb up).","August 21, 2015","true","3.1"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

It won't hurt you or anything, but you might want to prepare a walkthrough to help you when you're stumped.\n\nThe game isn't that bad, it has very positive features, but the bad parts are just too bad.\nDecent voice-acting (instead of none) would improve it so much...\n\nThe ending sequence is VERY quick - I think there is a travelling scene that takes longer than the whole ending.\n\nThe story is not exactly epic either, it's nice and if you view it as a "not everyone is a hero that battles unimaginable monsters", it's OK.\nIt got better after the research station, IMO. At first it was too much "Oh no, I can't do that. That was Steves job." all the time. (Which I'd accept as realistic - if one is a medic/botanist, one doesn't necessarily tinker around in engine rooms. But reading it every few clicks gets annoying. Besides, in the end she is doing all that stuff anyway.)\n\nA very positive feature of this game is the map which shows you which "rooms" you have been or can go to, and even indicates where you still have work to do. Very handy - instead of clicking half a dozen times to retract your steps, you open the map and are instantly in the other room.\nToo bad it sometimes doesn't indicate rooms where you have things to find.\n\nThe biggest problem is that many of the puzzles are - at least to me - ungraspable. I have no idea how I should have come to these conclusions, or why I would do that in the first place.\nAt least once I ended up in a puzzle without knowing why - I wanted to click something different, suddenly I'm in a puzzle getting a quest item as reward. Where from? Why? No idea. I guess the character bet against an NPC, but we're not shown.\n\nA few times the character knows more than it should - saying things like "This is on the list" when we don't yet have the list.\nFortunately, all the puzzles and games can be skipped.\n\nThe music is nice and the graphics are quite pretty - they're creating an interesting environment, too bad you don't know much about it.\n\nSo, as I said - when cheap, grab it. At worst you waste a few hours, but all in all I found it quite enjoyable.","April 25, 2015","true","3.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

You escape find their princess is ill, you enter the castle to heal her. Once you do you warn them there is a astroid going to wipe them out.

This game has far more variety of puzzles than just hidden objects, most of which I quite enjoyed.  (I had to skip one due to a very poor control scheme.)  Hints were available frequently enough that I didn't keep beating my head against a wall waiting for them, but also weren't often necessary.  And if you try to use a hint and there's nothing left to do in the room, it'll just point you out without using up the hint (I completely missed one exit towards the end of the game until a hint pointed the way).\n\nThe plot is surprisingly complex for a game of this type, although if you're coming from most other genres you'll probably find it lacking.  Part 1 is a pretty straightforward "get off the planet" story, with some really weird headscratchers (why would you hide a piece of your ride's keys inside a dangerous fan?).  Shortly after you fly off, you land on a medieval planet, get captured... and soon find a piece of high technology.  Figuring out why the discrepancy exists is quite intriguing.  Parts 2, 3, and 4 all take place on this second planet, and are distinguished by having some of the old rooms shut off and gaining access to new parts.  The overlap between each part ensures a nice continuity.  Again, this is all in comparison to other puzzle games - if I was playing a RPG or a classic point-and-click adventure, I'd have given up long since.\n\n\nHowever, it's clear that the game was translated by someone for whom English is not a native language.  Some of the hidden object clues were entirely obscure (when you want a "comb", you have to find a hairbrush, for example), some of the dialog was awkward, and there are places where sentences run together.  It's never impossible to figure out what was meant, but it's jarring.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed the ~3 hours I spent beating this, and I don't regret buying the bundle that I bought it in.","May 31, 2015","true","4.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

After a storm severly damages the station, the base, it's up to the main character to stabilize her love interest's injuries, gather their data, and fly back to Earth for medical assistance. This section is fairly solid - a logical threat bearing down on the player in an interesting and novel setting. Then the player blasts off and crash lands on a medieval planet, and everything goes straight to hell.\n\nFor reasons I can't fathom, the developers take the one unique thing that the game had going for it - a non-standard setting, and then decided to throw that away. By moving the action to a standard fantasy kingdom, complete with magic swords to repair and stricken princesses to cure, they make the game far less interesting by degrees - especially since the fact that the main character is from a far more technologically advanced civilization doesn't factor into the majority of her interactions once she arrives on the planet. What's worse, the one interesting mystery that the kingdom has to offer - why does a low-tech world have robot bartenders and industrial lasers lying around - has its solution spoiled by the game's map, of all things. Just minutes after arriving on the medieval world, the player gets access to a fast-travel map that depicts not only the castle they're trapped in and the surrounding village, but a secret monorail beneath it which leads to a futuristic city destroyed by a cataclysm sometime in the past. This is not how you build a curiosity, developers.\n\nNow, on to the HOG criteria!\n\nCriteria 1: To what degree do the puzzle screens look like a thrift store vomited on my monitor?\n\nThis is absolutely a problem, especially since the game has such a paltry number of Hidden Object Screens, most of which need to be visited twice. Absolutely no thought was put into the logic of what might items might be found in a particular location. The main character's closet on the research base is absolutely overflowing with the kind of random tchotchkes that one would expect to find in another game's haunted mansion. This raises the question of why someone would cart all of this junk halfway across the galaxy space. Naturally, the answer is 'the developers couldn't be bothered to conceptualize the type of junk that would be in a space closet, so they just went with cliched items'. Even worse is a subsequent scene in which a jail cell has a shelf in it fulled to bursting with random junk, much of which proves useful in planning an escape.\n\nCriteria 2: Are the searches justified by the premise/story?\n\nOnly in the most basic sense. From time to time the player will need to find an item to unlock something, and then a standard HOS will pop up, allowing them to look for it, as well as fifteen other items that they don't need. Space Legends tries to make things a little more interesting by having items which require assembly,  and while that livens things up a little, it can't cover for the fact that the main character has no use for a target with a bullethole in it, so taking the time to load and fire a flintlock pistol at a piece of paper seems like something of a waste of time. Just once the game attempts to colour outside the lines and offers a multi-stage HOS, in which the player has to find items and use them right there on the screen to unlock the next set of items and task, but the objectives are so poorly explained that it proves more frustrating than innovative.\n\nCriteria 3: How well do the various puzzles and object searches meld together to form a coherent whole?\n\nTry as the game might, it can't make the puzzles and searches feel like a part of the story. Not that it tries especially hard. Most of the puzzles on display are of the most generic type imaginable - move blocks to slide a crate to the other end of a hall; spin knobs, but doing so causes the other knobs to spin as well. Most egregious is the cloaking device the player is asked to turn on by doing a jigsaw puzzle. It's hard to get more thematically irrelevant than that.\n\nIn addition to all of the design failures, the game's presentation is inexcusably sloppy. While I'm aware that the game wasn't developed by English-speaking people, I can't let translation that affects gameplay slide. A brush is not a 'comb'. A lightbulb is not a 'lamp'. An hourglass is not a 'clock'. There are another dozen examples I'm not going to list here. Beyond the bad translation, some of the puzzles are just poorly explained. At one point I was asked to brew a potion by following the steps in a recipe - except three of the ingredients I'd been told to gather didn't appear in said recipe. Which forced me to resort to trial and error to figure out when they were supposed to be used. That's just sloppy.\n\nHere's a puzzle that perfectly illustrates the nonsense players are expected to put up with in Space Legends: The main character must use a crossbow grappling hook to snag a rope bridge so that she can cross it. But she's so bad at shooting that she hits the ceiling instead, knocking down some rocks, as well as the thing that was hidden behind them - the key to a cabinet in the princess' bedroom which contains insulating tape she can just to build a brace to allow her to fire the crossbow more accurately. Why was a key lodged in the ceiling of a secret cave that no one ever goes to? Why does a medieval princess have a roll of insulating tape? Did I seriously just have to go through a series of puzzle steps because the character I'm playing as doesn't know to fire a crossbow at the thing she wants to hit, rather than straight up?\n\nWith contrived nonsense, terrible presentation and generic settings ruining all of the goodwill built up in the game's full hour, Space Legends is a nearly-unplayable mess. In a sad final note, the game's end credits offer a possible explanation for its shoddiness. They start with an 'in memorium' photograph of a man who the credits quickly identify as the game's designer and scriptwriter. So it's entirely possible that all of Space Legends' problems owe to it being partially unfinished at the time of its release. That's tragic, but maybe they would have been better off simply dropping the project rather than releasing something this bad.","January 22","false","5.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Has map to aid getting around, highlighting where you are and highlighting areas you need to go in the storyline.\n\nStill, a negative vote for the way the hidden object peeve listed above.","April 18","false","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
