You will add their technological distinctiveness to your own.

It's a very interesting idea that captured my interest and I'll definitely be exploring all the possibilities.\nI had fun building my vehicle and mining resources for my little base.\nWIth the little time I played, I build my first little vehicle, fought a couple of vehicles I encountered on this planet and used their parts to upgrade my own vehicle into something more powerful.\nIt is easy to learn how to build and scavenge, so it is not a tough game to play. Even the controls and physics are nice and straight-forward. Not much complications to get in the way of your creativity.\nAnyone can simply jump in and immediately have fun with it.\n\nI am yet to try the multiplayer game modes...\nWe'll see where this project goes, but it earned my support for now.","August 23, 2014","true","15.6"," 281 of 320 people (88%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","88","281","320","13","21"

Roll around, kill enemies, snap their parts to your vehicle, rinse and repeat. The difference is that instead of a top-down, Asteroids style game, TerraTech is a 3D, physics based game, with some extra resource gathering and crafting elements.\n\nYou also have a base to protect, bring resources too, and craft from. Resources come in the form of trees, rocks, and various precious minerals, and you collect them by shooting at them, attatching drills or other tools to your vehicle, or even by just getting a big enough car to plow through them. Resources are not stored in any sort of inventory screen, but instead get added to a "stuff blob" that floats above tractor beams in your base or attatched to your car.\n\nThe game is still in fairly early development, and any problems I have with it at the moment have to do with the unfinished parts, which will be cleaned up as development progresses. I'm really excited to see where this game goes.\n\nIf you want to see the game in action, I've recorded a bit of it for my channel, which you can check out here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zz3pda_N_3E&list=UUBo9F0FU148NjZOJFN7rrGQ","August 30, 2014","true","4.3"," 226 of 269 people (84%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","84","226","269","11","2"

Last year we had some of the most wretched and weak indie early access games I've ever seen and you turn around and give us not only a good year of gaming but a good year for indies?! Oh my god I've found 5 back to back indies that I'm in love with. And this jumped up to my number one spot.\n\nWhat do you get for this one? A challenge. You don't respawn with all your blocks when you die, you get to earn the right to get those blocks back. There's a complex resource system of harvesting, refining, transporting and sending out. You get to set up complex conveyor systems to transfer your hordes of resources over to the cannons to shoot them into orbit to what I assume is a fleet.\nThe construction in this game smacks a little of minecraft and a LOT of robocraft. Which is a good thing! If you're going to take inspiration from something make it a good thing. THis game is still early access so there's a lot missing and still a TON present. You can make speedy road warriors that run off hit and run attacks or you can build these GIANT bulldozers to just grind over the resources and suck them up into your hoppers for transport back to base. OR DO WHAT I DID AND MAKE MY ENTIRE REFINING SECTION ON MY BACK. You think sloth's carry algae on their back? Nah man I carry an entire industry on my back.\nSo for the music its extremely limited so far, but its definitely an irish themed tune so far with the sort of jaunty cheer you'd expect from irish music. Its fun its happy and there's so much color that the music simply brings it all together.\n8/10 so far with the possibility of becoming a 9 or even a ten. Try the demo then buy the game because it gets even better.","July 27, 2015","true","8.8"," 133 of 148 people (90%) found this review helpful 53 people found this review funny","90","133","148","53","6"

It crashed whenever you made it through an hour of the game whithout coming across any of the other abundant gamebreaking glitches. I was about to get a refund when I remembered: I can't get a refund, steam doesn't let you. So I reported every bug I found and put the game on the shelf for a while.\nWhen I decided to give it another chance, the bugs were gone, the game had so much new content, and you could actually have a save file for more than an hour whithout it corrupting or one of the main missions breaking. It's a very good game now that everything is tidied up and rid of bugs, so I reccomend you get it.","March 21","true","18.9"," 89 of 103 people (86%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","86","89","103","14","7"

I have to say that even thoush this is an early access game, this is a $40 to $45 dollar game if i were the one to monetize it, with a huge amount of room to expand further and further. i can only imagine what the devs and the possible future steam workshop will deliver in added content. This game hints at the game spore. with some of its art styles and even a similarity in the storyline, fighting, searching for parts, and then getting resources in order to use those parts, like spore. This game is very original though, at a first glance it might seem a bit used, BUT when you get into it and start playing, youll see just how wide and varied the game mechanics are. i was even a little intimidated by its depth at first. I have not spent a huge amount of time playing this game yet, so i will add a new comment by the end of the week. This game looks insanely promising and im glad i can be, if even a small one, a part of its growth.

The only way to explain how far it has come is to look back at my original let's play videos, but this is not about looking back, it's about looking forward to what is, potentially, on the horizon for us.\n\nImagine an progressive open world vehicle and structure block building game with moving parts allowing you to build just about any vehicle or structure you can imagine and have it instantly functional WITHOUT the necessity of a "garage" or "build mode". Everything you do in TerraTech is "on the fly" and does not require you to stop playing so that you can build or customize your vehicles and structures. This feature alone makes this completely unique from any other vehicle combat game currently in existence. Include the ability to create flying vehicles, fully customize bases, harvest resources, and activate an army of AI controlled minions to do your bidding, TerraTech then has the potential to be the best combat based block building game ever.\n\nThe game is not finished obviously, and there is much to be done for it to accomplish all of the above really well, but it s still playable and fun. Even after messing around with the newest version, there is a number of things that need to get ironed out right away. So, if you are picking this up now, be aware that you will experience all manner of minor and major bugs. Not to mention, the sounds are still very 8-bit casual, and the soundtrack, although enjoyable,  has only one track so far and it can become a little... repetitive.\n\nMultiplayer is absent here, but it is a promised feature and I would not consider this a finish product until that becomes a reality, so I am crossing my fingers on that one. In the mean time there is a way to "invade" other people’s games with your creations via twitter, but it is not a directly interactive way to play with other players yet...\n\nI would highly recommend picking up the Early Access version of TerraTech if you wish to support the development process. If you want all of those features now, perhaps wait a while, but I do believe in the Payload Studios team simply based on their passion and current rate of game development.\n\nI am in no way affiliated with Payload Studios and I have not been given anything. I personally purchased the product in October 2014.\n\nThanks for reading!\nCheck out my channel for more videos.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/DeluksGaming\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0di7oNLhQc","February 6, 2015","true","63.5"," 99 of 119 people (83%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","83","99","119","7","0"

My four year old son also was watching me and wanted to play.  So finally I purchased a copy for him as well on his steam account.  here is a video of him playing. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMfiGLLnASw&feature=youtu.be Because of the way the developer adding instructions of how to play as very easy to read words he is learning to read while playing.  He has some trouble with the camera angles but he was blowing up bad guys in minutes.  He keeps starting over and loves creating and visiting his home base.  Thank you so much for building such a great game.  DEV: contact me for more info about children playing games.  Your game would work well in this arena and could do well in the homeschooling world.\nThe game is very engagement and I look forward to maybe a multiplayer in the future.  I have a few screen shots on my mega robot with 8 sheilds and 6 healing bubbles that has never died.  It can harvest $1000BB in less than 30 seconds and only looses the same five pieces in every fight.  I sectioned off there bays resources for cash creation and one bay for fuel to never need to recharge and one bay for resource development to craft new items.  (All on one mega bot)  I also really enjoy seeing the creations of other people when they INVADE my system.\nI highly suggest this game for any minecraft fan or robocraft fan.  The ability to take the parts from another robot and add it to your own mid fight is awesome and really elevates this game over many others.","June 24, 2015","true","132.6"," 81 of 93 people (87%) found this review helpful 44 people found this review funny","87","81","93","44","12"

But the developers are sub par. They keep focusing on new features instead of fixing the show stopping bugs that make it crash constantly and corrupt your save file so you have to start from the beginning after 15 minutes of play.  How hard is it to write data to a save file? What? do you have multiple threads hitting it at once with out any locking? pretty newb stuff right there. My suggestion , so that you don't tank a really good idea for a game, do a feature freeze until you done what ever refactoring necessary to address the issues so you get a playable game instead of what I assume are band-aid fixes all over the place.","October 31, 2015","true","30.2"," 81 of 99 people (82%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","82","81","99","11","0"

You build a base, destroy enemies, and use their parts to upgrade your stuff. You explore the world and gather resources to make yourself bigger and badder, and the enemies just scale along for the ride. You can build an amazing plethora of machines. Giant harvesting/refining rigs? Check. Tiny, speedy buggies and planes? Check. Huge monstrosities devoted to flipping enemy machines and laughing at them? Yup. Crazy machines with shields, self-healing armor...all well within your grasp if you're willing to dream them up. Even in early access, the game already has an amazing amount of content, only compounded by the community interaction. Remember in Spore how your creation could appear in other people's games, and theirs in yours? Yep, TerraTech does that. Enemy contraptions can 'invade' your world, forcing you to face off against other machines similar in size and power to your own, crafted by mad scientists and explorers the world over. 10/10 experience, highly recommended.

Take note, other developers.\n\nIf you are reading reviews you already know what kind of game this is.  If you don't then watch the videos or check out others on YouTube.  This review is more about the developers, the state of the alpha, and the general experience of TerraTech.\n\nEarly Access is a crapshoot.  Every developer makes promises of awesome features, steady updates, listening to player feedback, etc.  Most of them fall short of these goals, some fall far shorter than others.  In my experience there are three types of Early Access developer:\n\nGroup 1: The Real Deal.  These people make promises that they know they can keep, or have a very reasonable, educated expectation that they can keep them.  These are the developers who know what they are doing, have a plan, and know how to make it all work.  They have the drive and motivation to get their game out there and they look forward to feedback from the community.  They are skilled game designers and passionate gamers and they exemplify what Early Access is meant to be. This is like the big holiday dinner at your grandmother's house when you were a kid.  The food is great, its prepared with care and skill, and you feel welcomed and wanted.\n\nGroup 2: MEDIOCRE. This group of Early Access developer has some skill, but no soul.  They usually fail to meet some of the stated goals and they almost never involve the community in the decision making process.  They might end up with a playable game or they might not, but the process is often painful for everyone involved.  Updates come slowly and fans don't really feel involved in the process in any meaningful way. Sometimes they make sweeping changes to the structure of the game that result in an experience very different from what the fans paid for. This is like cheap fast food.  It was made by someone who doesn't care about the food, doesn't care about you, and will almost certainly "forget" the extra pickles you asked for.\n\nGroup 3: The Snake Oil Salesmen. These developers are one step above criminals.  They are the bottom of the barrel, the worst that Early Access has to offer.  They grossly oversell their game often with little or no idea how to live up to the promises.  They gladly collect the money, release a few half-hearted updates, then disappear into the night.  They often treat upset fans with unwarranted hostility and they usually leave the game totally unfinished. These developers can be criminal or incompetent...or more likely, a lot of both. This is like a street vendor in a shady part of town.  They are selling burritos filled with meat of indeterminate origin and they only take small bills. You might get a decent meal, or you might spend the next 12 hours doing a reenactment of "The Exorcist," but from both ends. Either way, when you return to the spot where you found the food cart you will see only a deserted lot.\n\nTerraTech is at the top of Group 1.  The developers are active in the community, they listen to public opinion and let it gently guide their decision making process, and they are very, very active with updating the game.  When I first started playing this game I found the tutorials a little hard to follow and the world was a little too harsh.  Within a day or two an update was released that clarified the starting quests and made starting out a touch easier.  After getting a feel for the game I found that over time the game slows down due to an excessive amount of spare parts floating around the map.  The very day I went to the forums to complain I see that a new update was released that adds a new block that sucks up all the spare bits and keeps the map clean.  Today I get on and see that they released yet another update that fixes some other minor issues the community has been complaining about.\n\nIf you browse the discussions you will see the developers out there talking to people, answering questions, taking suggestions, and engaging the public.  They don't just shake hands and kiss babies, they are there to work with the fans to make the game better.","March 23","true","66.5"," 56 of 65 people (86%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","86","56","65","12","0"

I am still loving it.\nThe game so far is an open world mode, With enemies all over and a few objectives to complete and follow.\nKill the other robots to harvest their gear and tech or whatever, and to keep on upgrading yourself further and further, And you can use special techs to turn materials into money and other useful stuff.\n\nNote worthy update 1# 3/31/2015\nA few bugs were fixed among the journey, Added a few more content, and a few balances.\nBut it seems that the game still suffers from bad optimization, It seems that I keep getting fps drops every now and then.\n\n7 Challenges, I like the flying challenge, you create an aircraft and see how long and high you can go, Keep beating highscores and try to reach for the highest rank.\nAnd also a racing challenge which is fun and others.\n\nI also own the dlc, And its really cool because it is a huge white room with unlimited techs to create WHATEVER you want, And also it gives you exclusive access to the experimental techs the devs are currently developing, And a few rams and stuff to test it on.\n\nYou can make your robot move by adding wheels, just thought i'd say this if you think you can give it legs and make it walk normally, This game reminds me so much of that battlebots combat competition where they create a small remote controlled robot and battle each other.\n\nI have a lot of time spent on The dlc mode and the challenges over 5 hours on them alone but since my internet goes off a lot steam did not record it all but yeah you will spend a great deal of time if you like that type of thing.\n\nSharing my creations with People on Twitter is not really my cup of tea, but others might like it, you can load their creations and use it in the challenges or the Dlc mode and they can use yours.\n\nSimilar to dark souls you get invaded by other player's character's except they are not controlling it, its an asynchronous multiplayer type, so they are controller by AI, which brings me to the point of AI being very clever and tough in this game their movement are really good you cant drop your guard down next to them.\n\nThe world is really colorful the music is similar to bastion (  Just 1 soundtrack from bastion not all ), The animations and ointment are also great, I also have a feeling that with the more progress they go with the game will be a bit more demanding on your Pc ( Its not currently demanding at all , was able to run it at my corei5 4gb gt635m Laptop nicely)\n\nPros :\n1 - An open world filled with colors and enemies, although its not that done yet but it is pretty great.\n2 - Great music, animation, ai, design and all is looking good so far.\n3 - Unlimited creativity to create what you please.\n4 - Unlimited fun at the DLC and the challenges.\n5 - Very promising roadmap not too big for them from what it seems, and once they reach it , the game will be soo good.\n\nCons :\n1 - While driving in reverse the control changes a bit unlike any other driving game, I mean its no biggie but still.\n2 - Though its still on its early stages, it already has a 16$ ->  now its 9,99$ ] Dlc that should be included with the game itself because its actually fun.\n\n\nYou might expect me to write more cons thinking ( The game is still early )\nWell yeah but please think of it this way, If you buy an early access game and get bothered with the little content it has thats your fault because you should know what you are getting before you get it, and this is the point of all my reviews, Is to help the buyer to see what they are getting themselves into to avoid the Buyer's Regret\n\n\nSaying it again.\nIf you buy this game expecting a fully polished experienced you will get disappointed.\nbut if you are an early access type of guy and wants to support devs you'd like this game if you are into sandbox robot tech building, this game sure has it good on that side.\n\nSo recommending it for he/she who meets the requirements I just said.\n\n\nThis review was written while i was a part of the original traders group OTG, however you can trust that the review was not effected by that fact, I was not forced to lie or anything, you can read it and judge for yourself, all my reviews are honest and I am no longer a part of the group.","February 16, 2015","true","8.4"," 42 of 52 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","42","52","0","11"

I liked Minecraft, but the game did not run very well on my computer; I liked robocraft, but I wanted something that was more survival based; I liked Unturned, but I wanted something more customizable. I started up the game and was met with a pretty neat introduction; but it was not long before I got killed and had to *attempt* to destroy my attacker with my meager rent-a-bot and retrieve all my items. Notwithstanding, I attached a payload rocket to my bot and began the tedious routine of harvesting materials and having them be automatically launched into the sky. I would buy new items through the payload terminal, but yet again, I would be destroyed and I would have given up and restarted. Additionally, finding anything was tricky, as I got lost very easily. I waited to play another day as it was in early access and I had already given the money that I could have given to pay for this game; I hoped my spending was not in vain.\n\nI left the game; it gathered dust sitting in my library for a few months; but today (4 December, 2015) I picked the game up again, after a day of work, and played it; it was an astonishing improvement: there wasa radar\nan objective log\nmany starting materials provided at the beginning, very easy to findIt may have been just my attitude at the time; but I found these made the game much more streamlined; of course, after the beginning, the game was less straightforward, but with every objective there was a new discovery that lead to another goal and so on and so forth. It made the game much easier; I now feel very proud of my bot.

Not to mention that I've watched more TerraTech Livestreams than probably anyone in the community- the reason being I love the game, I love the community, and I have very little negative comments about this game.\n\nThe idea is something I have been looking for for years- building and battling on the go, build your own bases, even make a mobile battle fortress! I have the R&D DLC, and I can recommend this to absolutely anyone. This game can test you to the limits with it's building- what sort of beastly battle machine can you build? Or do you want light and fast? Even a flying machine! Send your vehicles into other people's world and attack their vehicle and base. Adapt to different scenarios, battle mini colonies. The sky is the limit!\n\nObviously, as an early access, you will find bugs, but as a Canary (what they call the bug testers), I've grown used to bugs. They are in most games, don't expect the game to be bug-free and complete. That's pretty much my only negative. Bugs, and the bugs aren't even game breaking.\n\nTrust me on this one, this game is worth every penny, and if you want the best experience, attend the livestreams, and say ThunderCodes' review sent you, not that I won't be there! ;)\nLivestream link:\ntwitch.tv/terratechgame\n\nSo PLEASE, buy this game, and waste your life on it.\n\nTrust me, I've played way more than 30.7 hours.

With how much of a failed experiment this EAG trend has become, we have to assume any EAG is bad, unfinished and not worth the price they ask.\n\nThat's why this game gets a negative review. If reviews could work with points I would give it 0.5/10 or 1/10.\nThe game is still bad, unfinished and not worth the price they ask at all. To make it even worse they have already added DLC to the game. DLC before the game is even released. thisissparta.jpg\nTheir reasoning for the DLC is to give people an option to feel part of the development by letting you test blocks before they put them in the testgame... Payload Studios we are already paying for that. That is what EAG is for. You're trying to sell a beta for the beta so we can beta test while we beta test. NO. NO NO NO NO NO.\n\nAnd what's wrong with the game?\nImagine as a basis of comparison Spore the creature stage. But in TT there is no dancing, social activities, diverse biomes, helpful AI or any of the other things to do but fight.\nAlso after every fight (even if you win), you have to go back into the editor and rebuild your creature every time. Every freaking time. All the freaking time. Over and over and over and over and over again.\nAnd after every fight having to use the editor also isn't a super user-friendly UI to do it in. There's a camera rotate and tons of small ancher points that make it impossible to place anything under or inside your structures without losing your sanity.\n\nThe fighting isn't interesting at all. It's steering your vehicle's weapons in the direction of the enemy and holding your space bar until either you or he explodes.\nTalking about steering, after all this time they still have a game where cars reverse in the opposite direction. It's like not a single person at Payload Studios has ever driven a car before.\n\nI fear TT will never reach the epicness that the idea of it contains.\nAuto-rebuild your vehicles with the parts laying around you. A build mode that lets you seperate layers for better block placing. Friendly AI that you can select or program a series of action points and actions so they can harvest for you. Friendly AI that flies around you and that you can send to enemies like a drone army.","February 17, 2015","false","5.3"," 214 of 356 people (60%) found this review helpful 24 people found this review funny","60","214","356","24","13"

I can build machines for hours and hours. Machines that fly, machines that race. Machines that are particularly good at murder. Why then must i pay another $10 on top of my $20 just to get a little sandbox map. It seems like something that should just be in the vanilla game, not a whole different thing. Anyway, I'm getting off track. If you want story, progression, cool item drops, or anything else cool, you will not like this game. It is equivalent to the relatively early days of Minecraft before all this Ender Dragon nonsense where all you could do is run around and punch animals. This game has enormous potential, it is a blank slate for hundreds of fun ideas to be slathered all over it. It could be an MMO/Action RPG with awesome special items and weapons with different buffs and debuffs to snap onto your vehicle. It could be a singleplayer/co-op Pikmin-esque "gather pieces of your spaceship so you can fly back home" kind of game. But before anyone gets excited, this game has been in development for over a year and a half and there is still almost nothing too it. This is most of the reason why I hate Early Access and Kickstarter, because I could have experienced this awesome game way in the future when it had actually been finished, instead of now in its extremely unfinished state, where I am begging for something that will come when I have forgotten the game completely. I am really hoping this game disappears from my memory so I can come back in 3 years and be amazed at all the new awesome stuff. But for now, sure you can go hunting for special items and make loads of dosh but in the end it doesn't mean anything. There is no goal. For me that is an almost deal breaker. But luckily the many hours I've played of this game have been some of the most enjoyable of my life. And that is why I am desperately hanging on to my faith that the developers can do it, that they can complete the game and make it something truly outstanding. This game needs determined developers if it hopes to go anywhere. Don't fail me now payload studios. Also make that damn multiplayer already I need to get my friends into this game.","December 28, 2015","true","35.7"," 25 of 30 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","25","30","2","0"

Haven't had this much fun in a long while.  Since I was enjoying the demo so much I bought into the game.  The gameplay in the main game didn't let me down either.  Nonstop fun right from the start.  3 days into the game and 27 hrs to show for it.  The time just flew by.  The game can be real intense at times.  Especially when it comes to combat with much larger enemies. LOL I used my little starter vehicle (after my big one died) and managed to kill it , though I did die about 4 times in the process.  didn't take long to learn how to build the base and start collecting the resources.  Found just about all I needed on the forums.  I think the learning curce is fine just takes some effort to learn how things work. I already knew that some aspects of the game were not working, but I'm confident those things will be done.  Making games like this doesn't come easy.  Great job to the Devs.\n\nNow I did encounter some issues while playing, then again this is early stage developement and feedback is important.  I would just like to point out that the frame rate dropped considerably many times. Mostly when engaged in franctic combat with the enemies in large vehicles.  Though I think you may already know this.  Is there a way to inprove this performance on my end.  My computer system is well above the recommended system requirements.  Also I would like to know if you intend on fixing the sound, it only has one track of music.  That doesn't stop me from enjoying the game, but it would be great if I could only turn off the music and not lose the environment sound as well.  Great original concept.  For those who keep losing your resources while moving about, try using the slower wheels. The venture fast wheels make the vehicle to fast and that is why things keep dropping out (personal experience.\n\nI hope to hear back from the developers, you have a very good game here so I hope you polish the contents.  As far as multiplayer goes it's another milestone.  You need to bear in mind that the game does lag under the stress test and multipayer would not be a fun experience.  Oh one last thing do you have a timeset when the AI modules will actually play a part in the game and ability to craft the fabricators, I am looking for this to work.\n\nI'll give the game a 8.5/10 because it is not finished but the elements are there\nKeep up the good work and have a great day\n\nAce","February 14","true","80.4"," 25 of 31 people (81%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","81","25","31","6","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/EdenStarGazer/recommended/285920/","EdenStarGazer","EdenStarGazer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/EdenStarGazer/","429 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nTerratech is a well-drawn, lego style sandbox, mechanical design game that provides parts for kids to build and test cars, planes, and mechs. It has an open survival story mode; as well as individual challenge arenas. The pieces are designed exceptionally well, and are easy to snap together with no instructions. The availability of pieces in the challenge modes is self-explanatory and doesn’t require a manual for players to jump right in and begin building.\n\nCurrently Terratech is enjoying a boom in interest for the crowd that plays Minecraft. (There are a lot of Minecraft wannabes out there like Elvis impersonators.) Terratech is not Minecraft. But, like a similar sandbox mechanic game called Scrap Mechanic, or even Kerbal Space Program, Terratech expands on a niche component from Minecraft and goes where no miner has gone before. After playing Terratech, I found them to be very different games. Scrap Mechanic is more of a tool-based construction game, also in an open world. Like many people, I love Minecraft, and many of the newer games are learning from that game. While Terratech and SM both deliver aspects that Minecraft stopped short of, each one veers in a different direction.\n\nFor Terratech, that direction is automotive mechanics. It does have open world exploration, but that's not what the kids (& adults) are there for. Most Terratechies are there for the Combat aspect. They build cars to race, planes & rockets to out thrust, & mechs to shove other mechs around. Yes, it is extremely fun and exciting to build and then trash a design in a competition. It is similar to Besiege, but it improves on the idea by providing platforms and arenas for you to pit creations against each other.\n\nI explored the story mode, and like many others, I found the survival aspect of the open world to be counterintuitive to my efforts at actually constructing a vehicle while trying to defend my base. So I ended up in the challenges mode, where I discovered the sharing options.\n\nThe camera icon on-screen is not just for screenshots as it appeared at first glance. It actually saves a copy of the tech you've built to reload after crashing and trashing in competitions. It also allows you to share the tech via Twitter, a feature that I found cumbersome and unwieldy. You are unable to share techs without connecting to Twitter every time you log in to the game’s server. Then, you have the game search all Tweets for techs built and shared by the public. I most often came up with nothing. In the Mechs mode I found about 9 techs, while only 2 in ground vehicles, and none in wings or rockets.\n\nPersonally, I don’t believe too many kids playing Terratech have Twitter accounts. I hope they plan to expand sharing and connection options, as in being able to play with Steam friends. On the other hand, Scrap Mechanics has no options for sharing creations, while you can invite other friends to join you in game. But, one advantage perhaps to the current Terratech system is that while kids may not always be able to share techs, at least they will be inspired to build their own creations, which is a big part of this game.\n\nAfter exploring the racing, wings, rockets, and sumo mechs challenges, I was sucked into the world of the R&D dlc, and I was very glad I got that. It turns out the R&D mode is where not only many more fun building pieces are, along with the more colorful cosmetic pieces; but it is the only open sandbox/ lab in the game thus far. There is talk of such a sandbox to come.\nSome have complained about “day one dlc,” but the official word is that the dlc is for experimental users who want to try pieces out before they are actually put into the game. It does seem that techs designed within this R&D Lab are not available in the menu to access while in other modes. Likewise, techs designed in story mode are not accessible in one of the challenges. Each mode houses its own techs.\n\nTerratech is extremely playable with minimum demands from your pc, where Scrap Mechanic is not so friendly with high demands. SM also not only will take a learning curve, but places a manual in the hotbar for reference. That is cumbersome. And, in KSP of course, I’m sure that will take a learning curve for younger kids. I think not needing a handbook is great in Terratech, meaning the game is more accessible from the start, for a wider range of gamers. (They are all very well-designed games. Each game has its positives.)\n\nTerratech is early access, and anyone considering buying the game needs to keep that in mind. The developers are open to suggestions, and even include an email address for contacting them with ideas. The game is being updated regularly with patches, and you can expect a lot of big changes over time.\n\nPros:\nEasy snap-type building blocks\nClear linear directed goals with arenas and modes\nBright, colorful art and graphics with a western style of music\nActive and energetic playstyle\nStreamlined interface with no reading required, but the parts are labeled for reference\nNo parent ever stepped on a Terratech tech with barefeet (unlike legos)\n\nCons:\nTwitter sharing feature is not designed with young children in mind.\nVery early access\n\nI recommend Terratech for gamers who like building mechanical vehicles with a combat aspect. It is a game that is enjoying popular status for a very good reason, and I can only imagine what the future holds for kids who grow up learning to use mechanics from games like Terratech.","March 29","true","17.0"," 30 of 40 people (75%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","75","30","40","3","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/shadowsdarkness/recommended/285920/","shadowsdarkness","shadows_soul","http://steamcommunity.com/id/shadowsdarkness/","269 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI'm really enjoying this game. If you were ever a Lego person, this is the game for you!\n\nPros:\n1) Huge amounts of customization. You can build pretty much anything you can dream up given the pieces currently available. Seeing as it's early access, I'm sure they'll have more toys for us to play with eventually; at the moment there are still plenty of fun things you can build. The only thing that lacks much variety, in my opinion, are the weapons. Again, this is likely just a symptom of early access, and the weapons are still fun to use!\n\n2) Core gameplay is enjoyable. Basically, you start out with almost nothing and you need to gather resources to sell so that you can earn enough money to upgrade your tech. Along the way, you'll randomly encounter tons of different enemy AI techs that will attempt to destroy you. Trying to avoid them to gather safely, or all out engaging them for the hopeful returns of scavenging their parts is something you have to consider. My playstyle has me going in for the kill more often, but as I've continued playing and have more valuable tech that I don't want to lose, I've ended up taking more time to consider my actions. If you run out of power for your shields, you run the risk of losing your tech in a bad engagement.\n\n3) Combat. This can be pretty stressfull. As you see your enemies come into view, you'll probably come to a full stop. Many of these enemies can be behemoths compared to you with dozens of guns ready to blow you to bits (literally). Taking a moment to figure out your enemies capabilities is a good strategy. Maybe you'll have better luck if you come up quickly behind them. Maybe their broadside is weak, so you should focus your positioning there. Eventually, as you earn enough money and scavenge pieces off of your victims you'll end up as one of these behemoths yourself! Come this time, you may want to make sure you have countermeasures for the smaller, faster enemies as they'll tear you apart from your weak points that lack firepower.\n\n4) Destruction. All tech is built from smaller pieces. You place cubes together, just like with legos, and then put wheels, guns, and harvesting equipment on top of that (around, under, inside, whatever you want!). Enemies are made up just the same. When you fight in this game, you and your opponent will be trying to blow the blocks and weapons off of each other to reveal the cockpit; once the cockpit is destroyed, you win (or lose, if it's yours!). Many pieces also just explode if you do enough damage, causing damage to other parts around it; this also translates to blocks that are blown off and then explode later on the ground, so you have to be careful of what debri you roll over as it may turn into a kind of IED!\n\nCons:\n1) Optimization. First off, if you're expecting it to be optimized in early access, you may need to reconsider your viewpoint on early access games. For the most part this game runs pretty good right now; it's definitely playable. The worst part comes when you build large techs with lots of weapons. Firing all of those weapons at once TANKS your framerate to be nearly unplayable, and since typically you're firing to destroy other techs, their bullets just add on to that frame rate drop. Build lots of shields for complete protections, and have 360 degree weapon coverage because you'll need it. I'd expect this to get better later on in development.\n(Note: I'm running a very powerful PC and it still can't handle it. SLI 980s, 6-core Intel i7 5930k, 16GB DDR4 3000 Ripjaws, Asus x99 Deluxe MB. Haven't tried CPU or GPU overclocking to test performance there, but I doubt any OC I can achieve will fix the current amount of framerate drop).\n\n2) Unlocking new tech. It appears the developer has plans to change how this works, but at the time of this writing it's kind of a pain to unlock new tech to build with. Right now, you mostly rely on finding enemies, blowing them up, and scavenging their parts. Once you scavenge a part, you unlock it in the shop. There are also "levels" of a sort that you can achieve based on some beginning missions, and those unlock a few items for you. Again, I'm pretty sure the dev plans on cleaning this up. The hardest part is the fact that so many of the items explode very easily, so when you end up defeating an enemy you won't be able to salvage any of the parts that detonated early on (batteries, boosters, etc). Sometimes you'll get lucky, and that's mostly what you have to hope for. Again, I'll chalk this up to the progression system being new and since the game is in early access, I can't expect them to have finished it yet.\n\n3) Flying. It's possible to make flying tech in this game, but I wouldn't recommend it. pretty early on you can encounter and "abandoned" flying tech that the game will instruct you to reclaim, You'd assume that this thing will work well since it's pre-built by the dev, but it really doesn't. Maybe it's just bugs that need worked out, but I'm not sure. The controls are HORRIBLE for flying. You have to hold the SHIFT key and that keeps your engines at maximum; there needs to be a way to set your speed (add a throttle mechanism to the game please!). Also, the pilot must be drunk because if I do nothing but hold the SHIFT key, the aircraft continues to climb (as if it wants to do a loop). Not sure what that's all about. Additionally, turning is huge pain. As soon as start banking, your aircraft pretty much starts to plummet out of the sky. At the moment, the most you can really do with a flying tech is scout around for resources or nearby enemy bases to raid.\nAdditionally, it either needs to be made clearer through at tutorial or some kind of in-game mechanic whether or not a tech you're building will be capable of flight. Unlike land techs that can be in most any configuration, trying to build a flying tech is a chore. I've yet to be able to make my own flight-capable tech, and only the one given to me seems to be operable. Maybe I'm just incompetent, but my attempt at making a large-scale bomber type tech ended with a really fast land unit with weapons that shot the ground below it and no ability to turn (this thing have 5 props on it and still couldn't take off; I think it may just be that you can't get a large enough wing span to achieve the appropriate amount of lift.\n\nTl;dr: This game is super fun! I'm not a real reviewer or journalist or anything, but I'd give it a 9/10 as-is (for what that's worth). I can see this game being top-notch assuming the fix the things above, and add in more blocks/weapons/items to build with.\n\nAlso:\nAdding in multiplayer capabilties so you can play legos...I mean TerraTech...with your friends would be awesome, but by no means do I think it's required. You can't deny that it'd be fun to set up a private server and enjoy this game with your friends, though.\n\nThanks for reading!\n","October 15, 2015","true","19.7"," 22 of 29 people (76%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","76","22","29","4","0"

I've had to restart several games to get around progression-breaking bugs (eg, quest enemies spawning underground).\n\nHOWEVER, it's fun to play if you don't mind rebuilding your vehicle constantly and possibly losing your vehicle periodically if you underestimate a fight or get stuck.\n\nI enjoyed it a lot, it's come a long way since the demo I played the week it was released. There's a strange mix of very-well-polished features sitting right next to a barely implemented features. There's also some very odd progression choices, like I didn't have a refinery until I had the huge yellow tractor wheels. That sort of thing you should get early so you can start to build the bigger parts - refining / harvesting shouldn't be an end game feature.\n\nAnyway, I'm just conflicted. There's a lot to love about the game, but a lot that is infuriating because the game isn't finished.

The building is awkward but fun to do and quite easy since it is just drag and drop and play. The fighting elements are unique, you choose how to approach your enemy, from the air, from a flank attack or even just blast them out of history using 20 cannons. There's tons of parts to make an excellent plane or car out of (really, I mean alot. I dare to you to use all of them) which can make for some spectacular designs instead of the ag-old ♥♥♥♥-plane! There's resource farming which is quite tedious but dangerous since you can run into enemies  everywhere , but is worth the risk if you have found something work 70 or more  BB  (BB is the games' currency, it can be used to buy new parts) to obliterate your foes with unless you realize you have just bought one terrible wheel worth 2K BB which you could've simply got off an enemy. That being said, you can destroy enemies and then use all of their parts onto your bot! This makes the game feel more balanced but also a ton easier for players so we don't have to sell all of the enemies' drops to buy our own parts. The texturing is quite basic, however the SFX are the opposite. There's more content to come and I can't wait!\n\nGraphics\n\nTextures are basic and feel out of date because of that. This is something to be expected since the game is only Early Access and will most likely improve. Otherwise, the SFX are a ton better. The lens flares look as if they would be out of a AAA game, the lazer beams look awesome and aren't just 100% sprites, the building blocks look as if they wouldn't break in 0.5 nano-seconds. But there's not too much to be said other than this, I'll probably update this section once TerraTech becomes a nicer-to-look-at game.\n\nGameplay\n\nThe gameplay is awesomely fun! It reminds me of some older arcade games, there was one 2D game that you had to kill enemy planes to place onto your ship. This game reminds me of that classic. There's just too much parts to even try and find, so you will not get bored with having too much BB, oh no. There's many activities to do too, from simply mining for resources and selling them for fortune , to upgrading your warmachine, to making new ideas for you killer, to working out how certain parts work, to anything else. I could go on making a few paragraphs explaining why you should buy this game soon or on release, but I'm just going to sum it up quickly in the:\n\nPros and Cons\n\nPros:\n\nLow hardware requirements\nTons of parts to use\nArcadish genre game\nSimplistic graphics improve FPS\nTons of FPS\nFast paced battles\nFarming for resources (if you like it)\nDifferent vehicle combinations\nLow price\nReplayability\nAction-packed game\n\nCons:\nOther than building and resource gathering, the game is a little bit shallow\n\nI have been gifted the key by the kind developers of the game. They make my review about games like this possible.\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow   Game Related Universe\nCheck out the group.

Wheels, one gun, one drill.\n\nAs you kill enemies and do some of the starter quests you get parts from the actual robots you fight, they explode into bits and you put the bits... well on yourself! The starter quests get you some essentials like a battery ( for powering up shields, and heal bubbles ) and the game leads you through with a basic quest system on refining ores in a refinery, and selling items.\n\nCould use a little more in-game info on the crafting of blocks seeing as its a "wiki game" when it comes to crafting things.\n\nCombat is great, you blast away at robots firing all your guns at once, then steal the parts either to take them away to sell - or use them on your bot. The area where you build your base becomes a wasteland of parts from dead robots and there are ways to break down items ( the scrapping module ) and ways to make money other than selling parts at the stores.... by mining / taking down trees. There are various blocks that allow you to pick up items, make your own basic conveyor systems to either break down weapons/armor, or refine ores/wood to have them automatically sell things... power up generators ( which power batteries )\n\nIts very fun playing this game fresh from the start again because as a small bot the real challenge is there, you think "OH WHAT IS THAT!" at every part you can't recognize.\n\nEventually you snowball out of control either into a fortress of death with shield/heal bubbles, or into a mining maniac.\n\nYou can even man things you build with AI modules that mine or fight in combat, but the AI is very derpy.\n\nThe one thing I'll say is a con is performance is very bad in the later game when you have 50+ weapons firing all at once. GPU usage drops to 0, the game locks up when your bot fires and it makes it a bit troubling to play at that point.\n\nIts early access so pricing of parts needs to be adjusted for sure. I've seen earlier videos where things were priced higher, but as for now things are so cheap it lets you build ANYTHING you want with a blanket price of 100 for most higher end parts.\n\nThis is one of the better early access games worth playing and putting feedback on. I really have enjoyed the bit I have played, I hope for more parts - and performance tweaks so that the game doesn't lock up on super-mega-huge builds!\n\nThere is also a non-mandatory twitter integration feature I used with a dummy twitter account. It allows you to upload your bots as a tweet so they appear in other peoples games ( at the expense of losing that robot once its sent out as an "invader" ) which I think was well done and amazing.\n\nI look forward to this games completion! For a 20$ price point I'll say if you like vehicle based combat, open ended games ( this game is procedurally generated in its maps/store locations ) then its a shoe in. Just needs the rest of its content and some polish - the core gameplay is great!","February 14","true","24.8"," 17 of 22 people (77%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","77","17","22","4","0"

If you're a fan of Early Access, pre-alpha, alpha, and beta games, and supporting the developers by purchasing a game when it is in these stages of development, then by all means purchase TerraTech. Like any other game, I suggest you watch some Let's Play videos on YouTube, or watch a few Twitch streams to see if it looks like something you'd be interested in.\n\nTerraTech is a game about building bots, or "techs" as they're called. You can build both land-based and flying techs, or a combination of both. The game has wheeled vehicles, from slow and rugged to very fast and fragile. It has hovercraft, conventional flight, and VTOL/STOL. It's up to you how you build your tech. You can also build a base, gather and refine resources, craft objects, as well as sell them (or sell the refined resources).\n\nThe price, admittedly, is a little on the high side for a non-AAA game in this stage of development, but not so high that I consider it a deal-breaker. It was on sale recently for 30% off, so if money is tight, I suggest you add it to your wishlist and check your e-mail daily. It's difficult to say what is and what isn't a "fair price" for an Early Access game, since we have no way of knowing what the developer's costs and overhead are. I recently purchased a game on Steam for $5 that I felt could easily have sold for $20. The reason for the low price? It was being developed by one guy, which meant very low overhead. What it really boils down to, I suppose, is "will you get $20 worth of enjoyment from the game?". I think you will. And don't forget, you can always come back to Early Access games 6 months, a year, or two years down the road and play again.\n\nWith the price of AAA games still on the rise, it's up to us as gamers to support the independent developers and purchase pre-release games that we think we'll enjoy playing. The more small companies that turn into larger companies, the more competition the huge companies will have, which is always a good thing.","May 17","true","99.9"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","12","13","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeeJaxOff/recommended/285920/","TeeJaxOff","TeeJax <3","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeeJaxOff/","3936 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nTerraTech is a wonderful sandbox robot-building game for kids and adults alike!\nTerraTech is currently in very Early Access but still has hours of gameplay content, many different building pieces and a handful of game modes.\n\nTerraTech is the perfect game for those who like games that give you a lot of freedom in what you do. I was a big fan of Robocraft for a long time but after a while I found there was nothing to keep me interested and very little production actually happening with the game. TerraTech, however, is keeping me occupied and happy for countless hours even in it's Early Access state.\n\nI focused mainly on Story Mode whilst I was playing. The game starts you off with a simple yet in-depth tutorial that walks you through building your first Tech with the basic blocks supplied with you. It teaches you a little about movement, combat, resources and trading which is everything you need to get yourself started, then it's up to you how you play. The world seems nice and large with varying biomes which leaves you free to enjoy the open world and explore a little whilst doing whatever you like.\nYou will come across randomly spawned enemies whilst you play which can be destroyed and then the blocks you find collected for later use or you can add them to your tech right on the spot.\nIn fact I got completely distracting during the tutorial because of the freedom to craft my ship as I was playing! I ended up spending a large chunk of time just destroying enemies to build the biggest and best tech I could, and to be honest, I was pretty proud of my invention at the end of my first play session.\nTerraTech doesn't focus only on ground Techs though, you wanna be a pilot? Go ahead, you're free to build flying techs also though in my opinion this particular element is a little harder. After many attempts though I was successful and managed to build a tech I was happy with...before flying it straight into a tree and subsequently the ground.\n\nThere are challenge modes but I won't comment on these as I have not tried them in full detail. I am much more focused on the building/exploring elements of the game.\n\nI am mostly excited for the multiplayer features of this game as I can see myself playing a lot with friends which I think will make the game much more re-playable but also more fleshed out. Right now, despite the fact I am enjoying the game, I would love to face off against others in building challenges and combat. Multiplayer is on the road-map though so it's just a matter of when not if.\n\nIf you've ever played Robocraft you'll find some of the mechanics similar in TerraTech yet TerraTech seems a lot more polished even in it's Early Access state. Whilst Robocraft is very pay-to-win (this is my own personal opinion) TerraTech feels accessible and it's a nice piece of mind knowing that the direction the game is headed in is one that'll allow all players to play on equal ground with equal blocks, not being able to throw cash at the screen for pre-built techs to destroy the competition.\n\nThe graphics in TerraTech are really beautiful (I played on the highest settings) and I found myself immersed in the game world and actually enjoyed what I was looking at whilst exploring. I really hope the developers put more into the worlds though as there is a fair amount of empty landscape. This makes it easier to have room for combat and building, but can make the travelling seem a little lacklustre.\n\nI do have my gripes with TerraTech though but I feel that the developers will fix them overtime so that isn't worrying me to much. The main glitch/bug I have an issue with is one within the tutorial itself. I had to start my tutorial multiple times due to it glitching out and not knowing which point I was at. I had it TWICE when it started me halfway through the tutorial (get your battery from this tree) before it'd even given me the blocks to build my tech. When I finally was able to get it working it froze on one of the objectives despite me completeing it. Another issue i've had is where the map seems to be fragmented. There will be a huge open gap in the ground that you can see through (just endless blue). I've no idea what happens when/if you drive into it though as I really didn't want my tech destroyed. Another issue is twitter integration. In my opinion it's poorly done and wasn't thought through very well at all. Steam has it's own Workshop to make integrating community features easy so why do the developers feel the need to make me connect my Twitter account to be able to access community creations. I feel that the game is targeted towards a younger audience as it is, and most young people DO NOT own a Twitter, nor will they want to make one for the sake of one game. I finally took the hit and linked my account against my better judgement and found that there was in fact NO content for me to use anyway so it was a complete waste of time.\nMy last gripe is one that the developers have addressed but honestly I don't feel happy with the answer. I don't like the R&D DLC idea and I do feel there's a huge lack of integrity in releasing it. When a person purchases into Early Access they are paying to play and test the game. I do not expect that once I have paid for that right to then be told that if I want access to all the Early content I must in fact pay more. I thought that's what I was doing by participating in the Early Access in the first place. I understand fully that it was a kickstarter tier and that's why they felt like they needed to charge but in making the choice to put it on Steam, you should also find a way to respect those who are giving you money after kickstarter.\n\nAll in all TerraTech is a wonderful game with a simplistic, beautiful interface, many many blocks and easy-to-learn building. I recommend this to anyone who is a fan of the building genre and to those who are looking for a game they can one day enjoy with friends and family alike. I can see TerraTech being the next big thing in this genre and the developers seem very interested in making a game that can be enjoyed by everyone with frequent and detailed updates. For all those creative folk out there, this is something I believe you'll enjoy a lot and I can only see this game getting bigger and better!","March 31","true","8.5"," 19 of 26 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","19","26","0","6"

It is in alpha and that really sums it up. So I will just break down this down to a fancy short list of pros and cons that I find with the same.\n\nPros:\nThere are different corporations to find and build your vehicles off.\nThere are many types of locomotion for you to pick from, Land and air mostly.\nIt have hover pads, jets, giant fans, tons of wheels.\nEach faction specializes in something, so every block has its pros and cons which is really nice.\nIt has base building and defenses blocks\nYou can build a ship to your play style and it will not ruin the game\nCons:\nBase building, has no garage or slanted blocks for you make an “inside” in yet\nThe weapons are very limited, and very frustrating.\nA lack of biomes\nLack of things to do\nIts alpha atm.\nLimited engine capabilities\n\nRight now, I see this game going in a few directions, and we will just really have to wait and see what the updates bring. For an alpha game, its doing amazing. It plays smooth, weight is a factor, and it feels a lot of the core mechanics behind the game are set. I am excited to what comes of this game, and I will update this once their 1.0 big update hits, since that should change the game, and give every a good idea of where this will go.\n","January 4","true","4.6"," 18 of 25 people (72%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","72","18","25","3","0"

Had to reload my save a bunch of times till this issue dissapated, then again when it randomly appeared again.\n-Enemies spawn either on top of you or beside you randomly, making the radar block useless and it impossible to modify your build since build mode is in real time\n-AI is minecraft wolf tier with sprinkles bad fps tactics, friendly AI constantly gets stuck on Any obstruction, it's always behind you so the second you need to back up in a skirmish you're either completely flipped or on your side since the friendly AI will attempt to drive through you to get at an enemy.  Not to mention you have to back track constantly to find them when they've buggered off to do something else.  With all the open source AI pathfinding coding out there, you'd think they could've found something better.\n-The only way to reliably view the stats of a block is to pull it off your vehicle and leave your mouse over it for 5 seconds, which is made more annoying with the phsyics constantly fighting the wheel/map collision which makes the overbearing camera move taking your cursor with it.\n-No enemy bases spawn after the single one from the tutorial, too bad that wasn't mentioned wasted a bit over an hour of driving in a straight line while panning the horizon.","February 12, 2015","false","7.3"," 62 of 109 people (57%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","57","62","109","9","8"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Helias/recommended/285920/","Helias","Black Puppet","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Helias/","222 products in account","Early Access Review\n\n=[Early Acces Review]=\n\n[Heads up]\nThis review will be different to my newer other ones as i do this mainly to give the game the upvote it deserves. Therefore i wont go on with many different point on the game and rules set to the review. If you dislike my review: You know what to do.\n\n[Review]\nThis game is amazing. Now that i got that out of the way i will tell you why. First of all i want to let you know that all blocks that are in the game are available to you no matter what. You will have to unlock them over time by exploring the world around you and thats it. The DLC of the game mainly gives you acces for Blocks in development which is a nice addition but not needed to play the game.\n\n[Sidenote] - If i wouldnt have bought "SOMA" i wouldve bought it with DLC.\n\nBut what actually is in the game. What do you have to do? What are other players doing around you? Well the game is Singleplayer and to be honest at the current state that is the best decision. I dont even know if it will become a Multiplayergame at some point even though i would say that it would affect the game negativly. And why? Well the game is at the beginning very hard. You got your usual Tutorial which is very helpfull in my opinion and you slowly but surely learn how the game works. But there are still enemies and the controlls are not as easy as you can understand them.\n\n[Enemies] The enemies are NPCs. They are just like you tiny Robots or big Robots. It depends on how far you got into the game. At the beginning you will find tiny robots or medium sized ones. Over time they get bigger and stronger just like you. But if you loose to an enemy you can find yourself back at the beginning with a tiny Robot. And that makes the game slightly unforgiving. You can always go back and grab your stuff back as it stays on the ground if it wasnt destroyed but there is also a possibility of the enemy still being there. In that case a good defended base with shields and repair units can come in very handy which you can build just as well from the very beginning as the Tutorial tells you how to do so as well. But not only the enemy at your stuff can be a problem. I will mention a plane robot you can use further down and as it happened with me i crashed but was fully intact. The problem i had though is that a hostile robot attacked the plane and therefore destroyed it. That didnt bug out the tutorial though but it wouldve been nice to have it.\n\n[Controls] The controls are easy to understand but not as easy to master. Sure driving around is easy and to shoot you gotta hold space. But if you want to move around it can get weird. Sometimes you try to move to the left but instead of doing the wished for 50° you do a 360°. Of course this depends on your vehicle size but as the vehicle goes bigger, and this only at the very beginning, it can get very difficult to do anything with the current gen of wheels. As you progress through the game though you can unlock better wheels which make it much more enjoyable of course. But you have to get to that point first. Going on to the next part of the tutorial there is always a part with a plane. And that is where i would like to say that the controls werent as nice as for the robots on the ground. I mean you can fly normaly but if you turn right for to long you crash down. And as said above my plane was killed by another robot.\n\n[Sidenote] For building the controlls are as simple as the Tutorial said. But one thing they didnt say is how to rotate a block. As you attach a block you can still hold down the button before putting it down and then rightclick to switch it to a new side.\n\n[Building a Base] Building a Base that functions and where you can hide is probably the most interesting thing. Sure you can build your mighty robot but that one can be destroyed. At your base you can charge batteries that over time deplet as you can also use shield and repair units for you base to be secure. But you can only charge them with a generator or Solar Panels. I myself like the Solar Panels more, but hey, to each its own. Going on from powering your base you can also build a refinery which then lead refined ressources to a cannon that shoots things to earth for you to gain money. And that money can be used at the ingame shop location to buy more parts to build your base. Or you buy yourself a fabricator that can create blocks from ressources which is just as amazing. You can be as creative as you want with your base but make sure that it is secure. And from that moment on you can even stick a repair or shield Unit onto your robot plus a few batteries to go on and attack other robots without having to fearthat you might die and have to start over with a robot.\n\n[Ending]\nThe game is about exploration at the moment but has a lot to it. You can easily build a base and a powerfull robot but to unlock new pieces to work with you have to find them first or destroy robots that use them. You can then collect them and unlock them like that.\n\nAnd that has been it. Would i recommend the game at its current state? Yes. it is nice and easy to understand. But dont expect it to be very very easy.","October 2, 2015","true","9.5"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","10","14","0","0"

I usually cannot even finish the tutorial, before the game chooses not to let me go on any further.

At least not, until lots of issues get fixed.\nBut I would recommend keeping an eye on the game, as it has a lot of potential and could soon be worth the money.

Uploading your designs to twitter, apparently telling a steam user that the process of sharing a tech design can be easier if you use some social media is just a down right crappy idea. What could the developers be thinking when they added the option to share a tech design on a populor social media site thats soul purpose is to share information to people about what the user is doing right now. What I'm trying to say is people are complaining that they can't share their designs without using social media! Thats like me telling a cashier that he/she is a complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ for giving me the option of putting my items into a bag or a sack instead of walking out of the store with all my items in my arms. Anyway the whole twitter thing is optional and although I'm not sure you need to upload it to twitter to have your design invade other players, I do know that you don't need to use twitter to share your design with people. Just go into your C: drive click Program Files (x86), then Steam, now SteamApps, common, last the TerraTech Beta file. There you should find a PNG file titled the same as what you're design is called, next you just take that picture and share it to anyone you want.\n\nOverall at the curant state of the game I give it an 8.7/10 and hope to see more inprovment as it developes (most of all a Co-op option).","October 1, 2015","true","21.2"," 13 of 20 people (65%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","65","13","20","4","2"

While it did lack content and there were just a very few modules to build with initially, the Game has become quite playable already. There have been implemented 3 different "companys" (styles of components), the Mainbase, ressurce-management and Production.  In Sandbox you start out assembling a very basic vehicle and have to fight your first opponent right away. After defeating him you can assimilate the Blocks of that destroyed vehicle and already improove your ride. After discovering your Base you are told how the Shild (Baseprotection) works and how to collect ressurces, how to make money and how to research/build new Parts to further improove your carthingy. While you collect away and improove your ride, the enemies also become increasingly complex and more challenging - yet providing new, better and FREE Parts for you. Lateron it will be possible to command a whole Fleet of fighting-thingies to do stuff.\n\nPros:atractive graphics, that are fun to watch and "feel" good with the content they represent.\ncreative and interessting game concept\nlosts of different Building-components with more to come\nalso Planes\nvery determined and active Developers\na lot of ways to build your ride and even more aspects of how it will handle\nhas already some different game-modes including sandbox and challenges\nhuge potential for more features\nseems to be pretty stable already, had not a single crash\n\nCons:Camera is a bit hard to handle/hard to get adjusted to\nIn my games I had a flood of enemy vehicles besiegening my Base, more than i could handle at some point.\ntutorial seems to be repeating itself sometimes and leaves a good portion of the game "to be discovered"\nneeds more content for longer sessions and longer term motivation.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zorder/recommended/285920/","zorder","Zorder","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zorder/","2002 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nTerraTech is a sandbox game in which you build your own Techs (vehicles) by snapping different pieces and modules into the sides of your Tech. The game has a story survival mode and 3 different challenge modes, Racing, Flying and Sumo Showdown.\n\nStory mode & main mechanics:In story mode you crash on a planet (randomly generated) and you start by learning the very basics with a very detailed tutorial. You’ll eventually be able to check out the Mission Log to find diferent key parts for your Tech. If you click on one of the various missions, it will activate a waypoint that indicates where the missing piece is at. You can also guess where these parts have crash landed by looking for smoke on the horizon. One of the first items that you can find is your Radar and as soon as you install this one distances will become a lot more clearer,\n\nThe thing that sets TerraTech apart from other games of this genre, is the fact that you can modify your vehicle on the fly. You destroyed an enemy weapon and have a spare slot? Feel free to activate the build beam and install that weapon while the enemy is still hunting you. This created the oportunity for some hectic moments during battle while I was struggling to stay alive and improve myself at the same time. Building is pretty simple and straightforward. You press the build beam keybind and that will lift your Tech in the air. After that, you just click and drag parts to your Tech and they will snap into place, pretty much like legos.\n\nSoon after starting the story mode, you’ll find a generator that you can place on the ground. You can attach other blocks to it, such as a repair block that creates a dome and if you’re inside of it you’ll be repaired. If you attach a battery cell to a generator it will recharge, then you can use it to power up repair and shield modules on your Tech while you’re exploring.\n\nAnother earlier mission will introduce you to some kind of structure that you can deploy that opens a black hole and sucks every nearby part. These will then be stored on your offworld storage, which you can access by activating your build beam. Be careful though, because if you die you’ll respawn with the starting Tech, all the parts and modules that you previously had would have dropped in the place where you died, assuming they didn’t blow up. Don’t worry though, your starting Tech includes a semi-automatic turret that fires in the general direction of the enemies.\n\nAfter that, if I’m not mistaken, the game will introduce you to Trading Stations. If you have a tractor pad, you can harvest resources from rocks and other sources. You can then sell these resources to buy new modules at the Trading Station. Be careful though, sometimes “Trolls” camp these places waiting for some of that delicious booty you’re so carefully carrying.\n\nStill, even though there are missions, from what I’ve seen so far, they only serve to introduce you to the main mechanics of the game thus serving both as a tutorial and a story mode simultaneously. The way I see it, your overall goal is to get bigger, that is to increase the size of your Tech so you can overcome every and any foe in battle.\n\nChallenge modes:On these challenge modes you must first build your own vehicle from a selection of given parts, and you can use as many as you want. Then, on Racing and Flying mode, you need to reach every single checkpoint as fast as you can. On Sumo Showdown, you have a Versus mode in which you have to build a mech and you can then choose from 2 up to 4 different mechs to fight each other. This can be done automatically or you, and someone else, can control each of the mechs. There is also a ranked mode which I haven’t tried yet, but from the only mech slot it has, I figure this is PvP.\n\nFear not! If you’re not a creative person or if you just can’t be bothered spending your precious time building the perfect Tech, like myself, you can always import ones that other players have built - this requires a Twitter account. I believe that this is a key selling point for a type of game like this, some people just don’t want to spend their time building things, they just want to get into the game and start “playing” right away and that is absolutely fine and so I applaud the developers for making this feature already available, even though the game is still in Early Access.\n\nOther thoughts:From the moment I first started playing the first thing I noticed was the music, which is pretty damn good: I don’t know what genre it is but it has some sort of Wild/Old West vibe to it. One thing I also noticed was the lack of sound effects for your vehicle, such as the motor and also other background and ambient noises. So the game can get very quiet when you are driving around if for some reason the music isn’t playing.\n\nInitially I was having some trouble with maneuvering accurately but I guess it was due to my lack of vehicle engineering skills. Once I managed to build a solid Tech everything was good and I quickly got a hang of the controls. The game now feels very responsive and it is fun to hunt down little enemies so I can use their parts to make my Tech even more bigger and deadlier.\n\nVerdict:Great potential with workshop and user created content\nSimple, clean and colourful aesthetic\nA few framerate hiccups while driving around - perhaps map loading needs optimization\nEasy and intuitive construction, with tons of different parts to choose from´\nThe intuitive construction along with a very well made tutorial, which blends into the story mode,  makes the game very friendly to newcomers. This really surprised me and made me enjoy the game more than I was hoping, since I'm not a very creative individual.\n\nTerraTech is very easy to recommended if you’re a fan of games that let you build your own vehicles and machines of war. It requires thought and careful planning on how you should build up your Tech in order to defeat harder and harder enemies. I figure that in the future with more content added the game will only get richer and richer.","March 29","true","5.7"," 15 of 24 people (63%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","63","15","24","3","5"

First of all, i absolutely love the game, it is one of my favorite games i have . There are a few problems though, when you get pretty far into the game, say 10 plus hours on one save, the block number gets really high, especially if you decide to make a base. This in turn causes some lag, and under extreme conditions, freezing. While this type of problem makes sense, it limits the ammount that can be done in "end game". Another problem is that occasionally any base that you set up can sometimes teleport pieces of it a couple feet, this can cause different pieces to mesh together and making you spend the next half hour fixing it. This is a very annoying, but not very concerning as it only happens whenever you load an old save (note this glitch happens gradually, not quickly). These types of problems are to be expected in early access games, so i believe, and hope, that these will be fixed soon. This game has a ton of potential and is extremely fun to play and mess around in, especially since there is no one strategy that is good. You could be nomadic, set up a base, or even create and army of small bots controlled by AI. There are many cool possibilities and a ton of ways to have fun, i would strongly reccomend this game to annyone who enjoys free roam building games.","August 16, 2015","true","43.8"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","0"

While I agree early access is expected to come with a good amount of issues, I have to yet to experience one with such major failures. I spent about 10 hours the first game, building my base and exploring, only to have it all vanish into the ground, forcing me to restart because I had no way of acquiring a new payload terminal.\n\nThe second game went a little better and lasted around 13 hours before, guess what, everything disappeared again, at this point, I started this thread and learned about the saving my game file method, which wouldn't have been too bad and I could have dealt with.\n\nThen comes the third game, logging about 20-25 solid hours of base building and unlocking every possible block I could, saving periodically so I don't have to experience the loss of base again. So I continue to play for awhile, save, play, save, etc.\n\nTHEN: I load up the game, which I just saved, click continue annnnnd BLACK SCREEN OF NOTHING.

Creativity, ingenuity, planning, and knowing when to be bold or be careful are key, as this world is relentlessly relentless. It even has a good combat system that rewards those who plan their tactics and vehicle out in relation to their foe(s)!\n\n-Graphics\nGoing into the game, the graphics were good enough for me, but yet I always found myself using the fastest setting due to how resource intensive big bases can be. Besides, I never focus as much on the eye candy so much as the actual, playable content.\n\n-Audio\nSimple, and still lacking sounds for many aspects of the game, with only two tracks I know of that I nickname "Cowboy" and "Drunken Cowboy Broken Beer Bottle Brawl". I don't mind too much, as they're probably focusing on bugs instead for the time being, this game itself being early access.\n\n-Controls\nForward, backward, left, right, shift for hover pads/rockets, click'n'drag, and double click another of your vehicles to switch to it. 'Bout it. When it comes to how your vehicle controls, it's all on you and how you design it.\n\nAs for the stability of this game, I'd say it's best to relax, have some patience, or wait for them to fix up what's going on in the background. Early access and all that. Regardless, I've found a fun platform for unleashing all my little, devilish vehicles upon all the unsuspecting victims, "Invaders" included, as they get flipped right over by creations half their size, then have their bellies gutted so I can mount their 'parts' on my car. Who knew a game appropriate for kids could be so wonderfully vicious?\n\nI find this game thoroughly fun, and quite replayable. Also, why does the yes recommendation have only a one thumb option? Oh well, I give it two thumbs up anyway.","April 9, 2015","true","363.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I would be playing this game so much more if it werent for one thing.\n\nThe lag\n\nEven if you have a great gaming computer, this game will start lagging ♥♥♥♥-less after getting advanced in the game. I get around 5 fps at best with one of my farther games. The thing is, blocks dont despawn, and if you don't clean up with your SCU storage (which trust me, is a chore) then your game will start to become unplayable. Even cleaning stuff up with your SCU storage doesn't fix the lag. All the AIs that spawn, whether they be enemies or your own, will lag the hell out of the game as well. And don't even try lowering your graphics, it does ABSOLUTELY nothing.\n\nThis game is just poorly optimized and i reccomend people buy it after the lag has been fixed.

For everybody complaining about the DLC being a waste, do you actually know all of its atributes? Not only does it provide you with a workshop to build vehicles that would be hard to build in the main game; but it also provides you with forum access to private sections of the TerraTech forum where you can suggest ideas direcly to the Developers. Now that's not at all a waste of money.\n\nAlso, to the people complaining about bases being attacked, just build your base on the grass lands, it's simple. Grasslands are safe havens where you only enounter a couple of ememies and not the waves of enemies that you're complaining about.\n\nTerra Tech is a great game with huge potential, but before you start criticizing aspects of gameplay, make sure you understand the mechanics. Many of your problems aren't 'problems'. A great source of helpful information on the game can be found either on the TT forum or Wiki.\n\nTL;DR: It's a great game! :)","June 20, 2015","true","13.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I will admit though, the first 3 to 4 hours where not very fun. I wanted to see if I could get my money back but I stuck with it and now this is one of my top games! It just takes some time to learn what to do, that is all. I really like how it is based upon how strong your tech is for the invaders and how other techs spawn, this makes for a fair fight. Also, I really like the idea that you can't buy a specific item unless you discover it or craft it, this makes you have to explore the world and find the Tech that has what you need and take him out.

It's been years since I've had a game that completely cripples my system during a crash to the point where I need to perform a hard reset.  Bravo!\n\nThat being said, let's get into the meat and bones of TerraTech.\n\nAt the heart of it, this game is Mad Max meets Mechwarrior.   The gameplay reminds me of some older DOS games I used to play, and it's a genre that I haven't seen done right in a vehicle game in a while.    A lot of these games had fixed hardpoints, and fixed body types.  TerraTech's building system let's you build pretty much anything the wheels can support.\n\nYou initially start out with what's called a "Cab".  You get a starter gun and some wheels, now you're off to rebuild your war machine.  Initially the game starts you off on small, equal opponents.  You pick their parts after defeating them, attatching them and increasing the firepower (and weight) of your vehicle.   Parts come from various manufacturers, each avaliable after leveling up.\n\nEventually you find the singularity unit, and the store.  Now the real fun begins.  You mine some resources, and make enough to start building a base.  Drop your singularity by some destroyed enemy parts, and it sucks it into your inventory. (I like leading them back to it) The base blocks are very functional, and there is a pretty easy to use conveyor system for moving things to parts of your base.   Several blocks chained together can increase the value of your mined resources by refining them, then using the refined materials to make new blocks that you can sell.\n\nThrough refinement or purchase, you gain additional "Ai" units.  (Protip.. Use wheels that keep them slow.) Now you plop one of these on your first creation, and start working on a second, or you can just let the little Ai cabs run around your feet with their pew pew shots.  Your choice.\n\nGood game design has a few elements.  It has to reward the player into playing the game correctly, and Terratech does.  At some point your best car will have slow wheels (so minerals don't drop) a battery to keep a shield and repair bubble charged, and some tractor blocks in a t shape with a generator in the middle.  This way you just have to mine the oil, or knock down a tree to keep your shields charged.  Now you can really start dishing out the damage.\n\n*Pros*\nGreat concept based on an older genre.  Could easily be called "The most flexible" of this genre\nIntuitive gameplay that leads a player towards playing the game right.  Great design.\nGreat physics and mechanics\n\nCons\nOther than the crashes that need a hard reset, none.  Can't wait for it to get stable.\n\nConclusion:  As with many early access games, this one has bugs but from what I can tell about the dedication of the developers, I think these issues will be fixed.   If they can ever make this work multiplayer, it's going to be amazing.  Get it now while it's cheap.","April 18","true","55.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

Spent five hours wandering aimlessly, with no radar and apparently no enemies that spawn with a radar to take. The first half hour of the aimless wandering was pretty fun because there were random items scattered around and it became an interesting game of throwing together a hodge podge vehicle. After that, the random items stopped showing up. Four and a half hours later, no radar, no base, no items, and the only thread of sanity that I have left is the knowledge that one day, we will all die.","June 23, 2015","false","15.0"," 26 of 53 people (49%) found this review helpful 27 people found this review funny","49","26","53","27","2"

Basically at some point you encounter a bug or glitch or something that will corrupt your save game and make it unplayable. It may happen early, it may happen late, doesn't matter. So then you have to start over and after a few times starting over the game is boring. It may take you 2 hours, 20 hours, doesn't matter. With no mid-game and end-game goals or scenarios there is no reason to play. So if you are cool spending $$ on something to get 5-10 hours of play out of it, go for it. My opinion remains that this game is in a pre-alpha state, not alpha and no where close to beta.\n\n**** Original ****\nI thought I'd come back and try the game out, see if this update has made any major changes to impact my previous reviews for the better. Sadly, no. This game is in a bad state right now. Many of the blocks are not functioning properly, i.e. the refinery doesn't work at all. When key blocks don't work that just makes the game pointless really. There are plenty of other posts about other things, such as the aiming of guns and lasers being terribad now, which it is, and more posts on progress lost because previous saves won't work anymore, which they don't and does suck. So my review is don't buy this game, at least not until they release, as there is no point in playing.","October 27, 2015","false","113.7"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","46","6","13","2","18"

It has many things that the game needs regardless(like building and SAVING creations), so making people pay $30 for the full-fledged game is kinda stupid. In competing with Besiege at $10, that is probably a safer, more complete buy.\n-More bugs than can be counted. Not even full stable, let alone half-built.\n\n\nBOTTOM LINE:\n\nVery fun, has a lot to it. I can play for a few hours without getting bored. If you have a decent to strong tolerance of bugs, glitches, and stuff like that, this will be the best game you ever buy. If you don't, I would wait a few months. At the time of this review, the game is in version 5.1.9, which is VERY buggy for me, but is enjoyable enough that it isn't a complete fail, and I am sure the team will continue to update and improve the game.","November 11, 2015","true","52.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Building , or rebuilding a vehicle takes way too long. It is also annoying to connect  blocks together. You hold the block up next to what you want to connect it to, and it won't click on. Last thing, the accuracy of the guns we have connected to our vehicles have extremely low accuracy, but when an AI enemy is attacking, its like they have smart targeting or aimbot, which doesnt make sense because we can't really aim our guns so why are the accuracies different? But other than these, its a developing game that isn't doing that bad, but it begins to get redundant and boring at times.

Building , or rebuilding a vehicle takes way too long. It is also annoying to connect  blocks together. You hold the block up next to what you want to connect it to, and it won't click on. Last thing, the accuracy of the guns we have connected to our vehicles have extremely low accuracy, but when an AI enemy is attacking, its like they have smart targeting or aimbot, which doesnt make sense because we can't really aim our guns so why are the accuracies different?

It shares problems with many other building games:\n1. Blocks choices are artificially limited to prolong gameplay.\n2. Re-building is pretty tedious, especially if nothing dropped the part you need.\n3. The best designs just end up being bricks with as many forward facing guns as possible.\n\nI bought the DLC, and if the developer is reading then yes that's exactly what it is. If it were a barrier to entry for determined testers then you wouldn't sell a "Deluxe Version". The DLC seems pretty pointless.\n\nI should mention at this point that this is a Unity game, this is relevant because if you've played other games using this engine then you'll know that when developers say they'll optimize something, they pretty much cant, afterall they don't really have access to or knowledge about the low level aspects of the game.\n\nThe real problem with this, as with many games is that the core part of the game (battling vehicles) just isn't fun. There's not really been enough thought on how it could or should work and as such the best vehicle simply has a large mass and a lot of guns. It'll be next to impossible to fix that this far into development, so it's unlikely to really improve from where it's at.\n\nThe physics is pretty bad, but if you've played any of these games before that's expected. Objects will intersect and then either stay stuck or fly apart ridculously fast, and this will happen often.\n\nThere are other bugs and niggles, but nothing that's really a dealbreaker.\n\nIf this game cost £3 ($5) then I'd say it was well worth it, but at the current price it just isn't.","January 27","false","18.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It has many things that the game needs regardless(like building and SAVING creations), so making people pay $30 for the full-fledged game is kinda stupid. In competing with Besiege at $10, that is probably a safer, more complete buy.\n-More bugs than can be counted. Not even full stable, let alone half-built.\n\n\nBOTTOM LINE:\n\nVery fun, has a lot to it. I can play for a few hours without getting bored. If you have a decent to strong tolerance of bugs, glitches, and stuff like that, this will be the best game you ever buy. If you don't, I would wait a few months. At the time of this review, the game is in version 5.1.9, which is VERY buggy for me, but is enjoyable enough that it isn't a complete fail, and I am sure the team will continue to update and improve the game.","November 11, 2015","true","52.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AC-Gamer/recommended/285920/","AC-Gamer","AC-Gamer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AC-Gamer/","185 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nTerraTech is an open world block based combat game that puts you in the role of a free lance opportunist upon an alien planet. You crash land upon the surface in your cab, the first piece you get to set you on your way to a bigger and better bot. You can acquire blocks that can connect to each other in any way you can dream of, each enemy you destroy makes your stronger as their parts go flying about for you to gather and attach to your bot. Three corporations vie for your assistance, GSO the all around average blocks that are tough but have decent weight to them, the venture blocks, speedy light weight but weak against attack and the Geo Corp blocks, large heavy but extremely strong blocks that can dominate the landscape with sheer size.\n\nGrow your fleet as you build new and exciting designs but don’t forget to explore the base building as with the raw resources scattered across the three biomes you can craft and create your own blocks rather than resort to finding them from attacks, or if you prefer buy them from the shop to build the perfect creations.\n\nPros:\n\n-	A rather unique style of game play that will pull you in and keep you coming back for more.\n-	Build defensively or battle your way to victory, the choice is left in your hands\n-	A crafting system that promises to be quite in depth and enjoyable\n-	The combat is light and fun, leaving you wanting to risk it all for that next new piece you have yet to discover.\n-	The sound is amazing, both music and the battle sound effects all serve to pull you into the game and immerse you deeply in your new world.\n-	The graphics are great and will stop you in your tracks as you sit and watch the sun come up over the ridge or simply go out for a bit of night driving to see all the head lights of enemies off in the distance.\n-	A great deal of updates each adding a number of new and exciting elements as well as fixing bugs.\n-	A dev team that both cares about its players and listens to what they want.\n\nCons:\n\n-	The game is still in development and so bugs and crashes that can end your adventure and save game can happen from time to time. (this of course will change once the game is finished)\n-	A lot of changes with each patch that you won’t have access to unless you restart your game. (This is more of an inconvenience then anything as you will want to experiment with more costly designs and may find it hard to do so and restart all the time.)\n-	The more blocks you create and find the more lag you will see (this of course depends on your computer specs and the better the computer the less lag you will have but at some point even the most advanced computers will lag and become unplayable) quick note, if you drive away from the area with all the blocks your lag will clear up so may not wish to build everything in one location for now.\n\nIn conclusion, TerraTech is a great game in which you, the player gets to explore all the things you always wanted to build as a kid but never had the chance to. Lego’s meets battle bots in this fun romp through combat, building and crafting. 4.5 out of 5.\nAC-Gamer\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTyGAG_geVh4bHUZR29rqqNApaGLjAOdO\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=On28m6XxUn4&index=45&list=PLTyGAG_geVh4bHUZR29rqqNApaGLjAOdO\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wM81t0jWb3U&index=48&list=PLTyGAG_geVh4bHUZR29rqqNApaGLjAOdO\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iIv0-yKh5s&index=64&list=PLTyGAG_geVh4bHUZR29rqqNApaGLjAOdO\n","March 27","true","112.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","1"

This game is more unstable than the Eifle Tower standing on its tip.  This is not even in a state of pre-alpha.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Frostfinding/recommended/285920/","Frostfinding","Thesis Admiral Frost","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Frostfinding/","25 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nREALLY ♥♥♥♥ING AWESOME GAME! the fact that its always a new update with good and new features,i have 8 ideas for ai and new blocks, the first one is a rocket pod, a old age favorite, it has reappeared in the favorites of prospectors, although it doesnt have any homing capabilities, however it has only 1 place for a rocket, this old time favorite would decimate smaller targets and punch a hole in larger targets (Found In GSO territory). the second idea is mainly a ai idea, wouldnt it be cool to have a ai that scavenges the bits off of enemy vehicles and will constantly follow you and pick up the stuff of your enemies to take back to your base? so do i, so this idea is to have a ai module that has a built in thimble tractor pad that is just set to "Scavenger" and if it has a weapon, will use the weapon to defend itself, and its tractor pads will pick up blocks and other bits of stuff (found in GSO territory). Ai idea: combat drone. wont you like a ai that effiecently works with your scavengers to hunt down enemies and gather their parts, depending on how the ai thinks of its size, it will act differently in combat according to its size, Small will make them move fast and want to strike fast, Medium will make them manuver at some times if a weapon that can easily kill them, but if the weapon is nearly unable to harm them, they will stand there and try to kill them, a large sized one will try to take all the damage, and wont care if it dies by a devestating weapon, it might as well try to deal some serious damage (found in GSO territory). of course, early access harvesters might not work for pro prospectors (players) so a module made for complete harvesting is needed, it will use everything nessicery to harvest, even if it has no weapons, it will ram itself against something to try to harvest, but any weapons it has will be directed to harvesting. Detacher Tractor Beam, the ultimate grinder, will detach all your enemies into nothing but a almost easy to kill cab, perfect for scavengers and prospectors who enjoy watching their enemies humiluation, has a cooldown per enemy it disassembles (Found in EXP territory). AI module, Turret, do you want a effiecent turret that will take down any thing that is not classafied as "Ally" this thing is perfect for you, with a built in flashlight with twin machine guns, it is going to look at enemies and shoot them down before they get a change to raid your equipment (found in GSO territory). wouldnt you want some ai module that looks around, updates your minimap with things they found? the scout module is the thing just for you, it has 2 wheels and a built in radar made for scouting out a area, will run away and attempt to fire at enemies while retreating to a ai that has a combat module or guardian module for protection. dont you want something that actually looks for enemy that invades your tech, look no further then a guardian module, with a built in small minimortar that rotates, its made for protection as it will chase its enemies that come near it or where reported to it, it will idlely patrol the permimiter of your equipment and ai (found in GSO territory). thats all i have, the developers can make their own recipes for these if they actually implment it in, have a really good day :D","November 27, 2015","true","62.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It has the potential for hours of fun if you like this sort of game, but at the moment there is still a lot they can do with it.  It has quite a learning curve and is very difficult if you do not know what you are doing. While this means that, with patience, players can eventually build giant flying death machines to rain terror on their enemies, it also means that the lack of a proper tutorial level will severely hurt progress.You do have the R&D pack, but that costs extra money and is still a little overwhelming if you don't know what you are doing.\n\nAnother problem is that every time you die, you are back to a very weak, tiny tank and have to either go back and miraculusly defeat the enemy that killed you or start over from scratch, and neither option is a good one. This can lead to and endless cycle where you can never get to the point where the game really shines: when you already have all the parts you could ever need and get to create anything that comes to mind. There could be a solution to this: have an option to buy your old designs from the trade station. This would allow you to quickly get back to where you were, while still providing a punishment for death (having to pay for all the parts.) Speaking of which, another good addition would be the ability to sell off excess parts.\n\nI personally requested a refund for my copy, but if this game ends up meeting its potential I would happily buy it back.\n\nAll in all, it has the potential for being a great game, but at the moment only people willing to risk it never panning out should get it. After all, that is what early access means, right?","December 29, 2015","true","1.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You wouldn't get far because you'd have raiders and enemies attacking your base while you build, so get ready to build your torrents!\n\non the lines of building your vechical you can never tell when your wheels are over-loaded and how it does on hills and that the real struggle on the game but they should add a function to allow you to see the weight on the parts you add and the total weight based on the amount of wheels and supporters you have!

The big turn off of this game is the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t factor of building your vehicles while fighting the enemy, I want to build in peace with what I have so I can screw around and make whatever, games like from the depths do this and it encourages trial and error, hell, I even built a fully developed navy and an airforce to fight other armies in said game, why can't I do the same on here? I didn't pick up the dlc because it's even more money poured into a game that settles off as average as is. I like the game because it's an easy pick up game that I can screw around in for some time. I just wish I could build in peace because on numerous occasions I have been ambushed by the AI to either have my working piece of art destroyed, or a random vehicle like the plane you find missing a wing because the AI decided that anything you're around should be gone too.\n\nI give this game a 7/10 , it's in the works so I have hope.","March 17","true","3.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Fun factor: 10 (nothing better than destroying your opponent then using his pieces to strengthen yourself)\n\n2. Creative factor: 9 (it becomes a 10 with the R&D pack as you can save your creations then purchase them in story mode)\n\n3. Challenge factor: 7 (fights can be challenging but once you learn the nuances of certain techs and the corporations that they are using you can adapt relatively easily.  It can be heartbreaking losing your tech that you've spent hours on building, especially if you didn't save it and is the reason I didn't rate this aspect of the game lower)\n\n4. Graphics factor: 8 (this is a personal preference I'm sure, but I like the sort of cartoonish graphics and the bright color range that is present.  Also, the nights are dark, and sort of longish... and winter may be coming... though the lights make everything look pretty!)\n\n5. Music factor: 7 (I enjoy the couple of tracks that are present in the game.  I enjoy the calming strum of the track that plays during peaceful times, and I like the battle track decently enough as well.  I hold music as a very important aspect to experiencing a game)\n\n6. Cinematics factor: 5 (the only cinematic sequence is in the very beginning when you witness your pod crash landing to the planet, though it looks great!)\n\n7. Story factor: 6 (there are story aspects that are in the game right now through the item descriptions on the various blocks/weapons that are available.  Could end up being pretty good for this type of game however)\n\n8. Content factor: 8 (4 biomes, 5 corporations with more to be added I believe, and tons of blocks per corporation)\n\n9. Control factor: 8 (the only issue I've had was reversing a tech.  There is an option to switch the direction you must press in order to move that way.  e.g. moving forward and turning to the right, to reverse you can have it set to either moving backwards and turning to the left OR remain turning to the right.  I keep the latter option on as it feels more natural to this game, but is opposite of what most other games do with their turning while moving forward or reverse)\n\n10. Gameplay factor: 10 (its pure fun from the outset, with the possibility of soul crushing loss if you lose your giant tech you've spent hours on building.  That feeling goes away quickly however as you begin building up your tech from scratch again.  Chicago wouldn't be as great of a city as it is if not for the fire)\n\nIssues:\n\n1. Some crashing still though not nearly as much as I experienced from early builds.  Mechanically speaking I've witnessed great improvements in the last few updates.  The game handles large vehicles and lots of blocks admirably at this point.\n\n2. Story quests still need more fleshing out.  Some still hang up and will not complete but the system itself is working great.\n\n3.  Flying techs, while fun, don't really mesh too well with the game right now.  Sure you can make them but they are really only useful for exploration purposes.\n\nSpeaking of flight I have made a smaller fighter type flying tech that is propelled upwards by mini guns.  The only issue with this is when I get close enough to another tech to attack it, the mini guns auto aim and throw off the vertical thrust needed to maintain level flight.  It also isn't capable of sustained fire on a single target.  I have yet to see a combat worthy flying tech.  This is a very minor gripe however.\n\nIt is easy to lose hours upon hours tinkering in the R&D section.  It is equally as easy to lose that much and more to the story mode.  I like having to explore for new parts and each part augments what you can do by quite a bit.  There is little redundancy amongst the block types available.  Speaking to this as well is the fact that I really don't mind starting new games and each patch has refined the starting process more and more.\n\nTerraTech is a great example of a fun sandbox game where you're left to your own devices.  Though I wish there were more purpose in designing some of your techs with the available corporations, there is still time for all that to be fleshed out at a later date and the present amount of content is absolutely worth the money, especially with the R&D DLC.\n\nI give TerraTech in its current state a 7.8/10 rating and it gets better with every patch.  The dev team is passionate and great at communication, and the community is very helpful as well.\n","March 14","true","126.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's buggy which is totally acceptable for an early access. This far I've only gotten to level 3 out of 5. Devs are active, the game even lets you know when they're steaming, which is fairly often.

I think it's because you can do whatever  you want, and whatever you do, it's going to be pretty cool.\n\nSure, there are bugs, and the game structure is skeletal, but this is a highly immersive experience.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Frostfinding/recommended/285920/","Frostfinding","Thesis Admiral Frost","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Frostfinding/","25 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nREALLY ♥♥♥♥ING AWESOME GAME! the fact that its always a new update with good and new features,i have 8 ideas for ai and new blocks, the first one is a rocket pod, a old age favorite, it has reappeared in the favorites of prospectors, although it doesnt have any homing capabilities, however it has only 1 place for a rocket, this old time favorite would decimate smaller targets and punch a hole in larger targets (Found In GSO territory). the second idea is mainly a ai idea, wouldnt it be cool to have a ai that scavenges the bits off of enemy vehicles and will constantly follow you and pick up the stuff of your enemies to take back to your base? so do i, so this idea is to have a ai module that has a built in thimble tractor pad that is just set to "Scavenger" and if it has a weapon, will use the weapon to defend itself, and its tractor pads will pick up blocks and other bits of stuff (found in GSO territory). Ai idea: combat drone. wont you like a ai that effiecently works with your scavengers to hunt down enemies and gather their parts, depending on how the ai thinks of its size, it will act differently in combat according to its size, Small will make them move fast and want to strike fast, Medium will make them manuver at some times if a weapon that can easily kill them, but if the weapon is nearly unable to harm them, they will stand there and try to kill them, a large sized one will try to take all the damage, and wont care if it dies by a devestating weapon, it might as well try to deal some serious damage (found in GSO territory). of course, early access harvesters might not work for pro prospectors (players) so a module made for complete harvesting is needed, it will use everything nessicery to harvest, even if it has no weapons, it will ram itself against something to try to harvest, but any weapons it has will be directed to harvesting. Detacher Tractor Beam, the ultimate grinder, will detach all your enemies into nothing but a almost easy to kill cab, perfect for scavengers and prospectors who enjoy watching their enemies humiluation, has a cooldown per enemy it disassembles (Found in EXP territory). AI module, Turret, do you want a effiecent turret that will take down any thing that is not classafied as "Ally" this thing is perfect for you, with a built in flashlight with twin machine guns, it is going to look at enemies and shoot them down before they get a change to raid your equipment (found in GSO territory). wouldnt you want some ai module that looks around, updates your minimap with things they found? the scout module is the thing just for you, it has 2 wheels and a built in radar made for scouting out a area, will run away and attempt to fire at enemies while retreating to a ai that has a combat module or guardian module for protection. dont you want something that actually looks for enemy that invades your tech, look no further then a guardian module, with a built in small minimortar that rotates, its made for protection as it will chase its enemies that come near it or where reported to it, it will idlely patrol the permimiter of your equipment and ai (found in GSO territory). thats all i have, the developers can make their own recipes for these if they actually implment it in, have a really good day :D","November 27, 2015","true","62.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The propeller on the default plane broke due to crashing before I could actually comprehend the controls.\n\nNow before I get yelled at. It definately can be fun, and it has major potential.

Fuththermore the games story is non existent to a brand new player such as i. i think it shoulld be new enimies invading not just random ones and they have coloured and specific to each biome so they are adapted to it. the enimies should als fight each other only have a slightly higher chance of attacking a player over another ai.\nthis game is alright but it is way to over priced. my advice is to make the game cheaper and improve on the issues stated in this and  all the comments its alright and control can become odd.\n\nconsider i bought the game by accedent but it used to be on my wishlist anyway","July 26, 2015","false","0.2"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","42","5","12","0","0"

I would and wouldn't recommend this game, Its great but it lacks so much stuff that it could be doing, like multiplayer for instance. It also lacks a workshop to my knowledge, and you can only send your stuff to attack other people via twitter,You cant just send it out to attack some one without twitter. But all of these things are eclipsed by there being no multiplayer. yes i recommend it for how fun it is but i hate that I've had to start over multiple times because after every update either i want to try it out and can't or i'm forced to because my buy block dissapears for no reason. No i don't recommend it because of the stuff you just read a few seconds ago. No multiplayer either, I was expecting a survival based multiplayer or something similar and fun, So far no luck I really hope this is on the devs mind or agenda. perhaps if its not going to be "fun" with a ton of people playing together how about spreading them out over a huge map? making it if 10s of people were on one map or even hundreds with the release of multiplayer, encounters with other people would make it only 1-2 per 4-5 minutes.

I don't see why your story progression limits your level. Atleast allowing us to level would compensate for a bug such as BUT NOT LIMITED TO:\n--The quest item required to proceed simply does not spawn. Delivery cannon, for example will not spawn occasionally, forcing to restart the games entire story, not to mention stopping your progression ENTIRELY, which stops you from simply killing other techs to get the level and money to buy a delivery cannon.\n--The quest will tell you to do the wrong objective. The only way to progress would be to accidentally do the (real) objective, or know from previous playthroughs what to do next (this is how i found this problem, it was telling me to do something i knew i had already done, so i did the next objective i remembered, and the story continued as normal.)\n--Poor objective descriptions. And when i say poor, i mean very, very cut-and-dry. Adding some better instructions for the UI might help mask this problem, as you can use the UI to navigate much often better then reading the instructions given.\n\nNo "Adventure" or "Survival" mode.\nThe options are challenges, story, or buy DLC to play creatively.\nI'd like to start fresh, level up at my own pace, build a base, get a fleet, so on and so forth, but the story is continually breaking, forcing me to restart my progress.\n\nThere is also no option to 'save' my veicle even as a stencil, so if i build something i like and it gets destroyed in battle and i forget how i built it, there is no way to get it back, even if i have WAY more resources then needed.\nI think saving a vehicle should be implemented in the trading posts somehow, you save vehicles and they show up in  the 'techs' tab. you buy them with an amount determined by the vehicles size, weapons, etc..\n\nI'll change my review when i can freely progress in the game, without being stopped or slowed down by a quest line i may or may not even want or need to complete (its basically a tutorial mode, not a story mode,)","October 12, 2015","false","10.5"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","1"

There is none.\n\nAnother shining example of why you should stay away from early access.\n\nEdit:  Harsh criticisim can be difficult to swallow and the Dev spam cometh.

Considering this review is not even two months old she apparently gets paid to spam my review or has nothing better to do while sitting in her cubical.\n\nTattooKitty/KattStrike/CopyKatt: 3 She seems to prefer to come in immediately after a different dev has posted and so far she has only copy and pasted what the previous dev replied with.\n\nButthurt Fanboys: 5 Every game has them.\n\nSaiwun and and another dev or two have replied a couple times as well but their name escapes me.","December 4, 2015","false","172.4"," 3 of 13 people (23%) found this review helpful","23","3","13","0","2"

This game is a waste of money! To start off I want to say that the camera is near to impossible to control. It was a game in itself trying to figure out what was going on.

Great. 1-2 hours of your life wasted. Now time to mine. Oh boy. I literaly had to watch people play because I just couldn't stand it. Why would you want to do this?!

You can also mine ores and gather resources to either craft new stuff or sell for a profit.  You can use these profits to get more items and make your robot even better.\n\nBefore, I did not like this game because you were required to rebuild yourself every time you fought and I really had no idea what I was doing.  Now, the creators have updated the game so it is more balanced and there is a good starting tutorial.  With this new update, rebuilding isn't a big deal at all and I enjoy this game a lot.\n\nMy only issues with the current version is the AI doesn't really work and there are one or two crafting paradoxes (you need the item you are trying to craft to craft the item you are trying to craft).

However, the other vehicles are trying to destroy you. If they succeed, you have to start all over again.\nPros:\nThis game has a cool, futuristic stetting,\nIt has multiple types of weapons, all of which can be used in different, creative ways to ward off attackers,\nIt has an epic opening scene (on the real thing, not the demo),\nYOU CAN FLY! Of course, after you get to a point in the game when you find a flying machine,\nYou can build whatever you want (as long as you feel up to it).\nCons:\nThis game is kind of laggy if you do not have a good computer,\nIt is very challenging, and it can get really hard to control your emotions if your vehicle goes boom,\nSome enemies spawn more powerful than you are,\nYou need to find a flying gimmick before you can fly, and the takeoff is really complicated,\nAnd some enemies are annoying if you are just innocently salviging the parts from another vehicle, and they attack.\nNeither:\nThe game is hard to learn.\nOverall, I rate four stars.","February 22","true","22.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

All and all my view of this game is positive!\n\nThings I wish the Early Access Version had?  The ability to spawn items!  The game crashes (for me) a lot, normally when I'm some hours into the game, just when (for me) it starts to get really fun, I've got into the habit of using the save feature a lot not that it helps very much, the black screen of death haunts my dreams! :P\n\nI like this game, but I've had to start over at least 5 times and I'm about to start a new game right after this review!  The building is fun, the exploring for new items is fun and building up my base is a lot of fun as well and I would enjoy this game far more if it was stable or at least provided something like (item spawn) so you didn't have to spend 3 more hours recovering from the crashes.","July 15, 2015","true","162.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game itself has great graphics and the whole idea is just so good. What you do in the game is you start with a little car (they call it a tech) in which you drive off with and start to recover fragments of your Base Bomb which you also came in and have to fight off enemies with extremely good AI so that you can get parts. Once you have being playing the game for a while you will need to build a base to progress more or you can just keep on venturing until you find one but then you will have to fight off gaurdians.If you do get Terra Tech watch out because once you start playing time is like fluid from than on.

Very nice art style, lovely soundtrack, intuitive controls and building mechanics and really good progression. You start off with a tiny little vehicle (or Tech) and you smash up other techs to get more parts and possibly new parts. There is also a crafting system to create bits and bobs. Exploration is quite a big part of the game because this is how you find different resources for crafting and there are different bioms/environments around the world that have different techs driving around with new parts.\n\nThis game is already great and there's still loads to come.

The game itself has great graphics and the whole idea is just so good. What you do in the game is you start with a little car (they call it a tech) in which you drive off with and start to recover fragments of your Base Bomb which you also came in and have to fight off enemies with extremely good AI so that you can get parts. Once you have being playing the game for a while you will need to build a base to progress more or you can just keep on venturing until you find one but then you will have to fight off gaurdians.If you do get Terra Tech watch out because once you start playing time is like fluid from than on.

Resources are overabundant, as you only use the sun + solar generators.\n\nYou can get fuel tanks, but they regenerate without having to get any resources. Lame.\n\nYou need to defend yourself a lot, but making some solar generators with turrets and shields can fend off most anything.\nIf you don't make a shielded vehicle you'll spend too much time rebuilding it. Barely giving enough time to progress. Forces a specific type of gameplay.\n\nThe enemy AI doesn't use shields, yet they carry them, and also empty batteries.\n\nThe controls are messy when flying, holding S to lift off is also the break button for the wheels. You can imagine.\n\n\nAnyways, this game has immense potential, it could become huge. But as it is now, it's nothing more than a great idea.\n\n\nThere's a LOT of potential, this could really become big, but yeah, they need to sit down, listen to the community, and fix a few things, and add a lot more.\n\n\nAlpha, yes, I know.

I recommend it to everyone who enjoyed playing robocraft, and other games like this. I dont know why a lot of people say it's bugged. I have found some bugs in tutorial missions, but most of them you can fix by Save+ Exit and then load your save again.\n\nGood things:\n-You can do whatever you want (following missions at the beggining of game gives you bigger chances to survive)\n-Robots are good matched, if you build a big ♥♥♥ rtech, there wont be that much of small enemies, and vice versa.\n-You can harvest resources and sell them, or be a hunter, kill other techs and sell their parts.\n-You can build a plane, or a car, or tank on wheels, or whatever you want (except from boats). I think some people build helicpoters too, but it's quite hard.\n-If you want to change your robot you dont have to rebiuld everything, just buy another cab (of course from in game money) and bild other want, if you want to change between them, just click on them.\n-No microtransactions\n-Devs care about this game\n-Nice and helpfull comunity\n-Easy to learn, hard to master\n\nBad things:\n-Some bugs\n-Beggining of the game maybe hard if you play first time, my tip: before you go to trading station kill some techs, and make your tech stronger, at the trading stations there may be powerfull enemies.\n-It took me 1 hour to understand how to build good things, and why my wheels are sparkling (overweight)\n-Sometimes when you rebuild your tech, for example you take all of your guns and wheels down to put them better, game throws enemies at you, so you have to be carefull at building, and always have some defence\n-Price is a bit to high, anyway this game is good so if price would be lower I'd donate them\n\nGood luck at playing!

There have been some complaints about Twitter integration, however that is optional. I have played several hours and have never linked my Twitter account to the game. The sandbox aspect of the game is very nicely put together and reasonably intuitive. The ability to make aircraft for in-air dogfights is downright spectacular.\n\nPros: Easy to learn, with the advanced stuff still being complex enough to be entertaining. Nice variation of AI opponents, which scale nicely with your advancement level. Lastly: PLANES!\n\nCons: At this point there is no multiplayer beyond basic sharing of vehicle designs through Twitter. Unless they add some PvP this game will get boring once you've played with most of the pieces. Also, the turning controls are a little counterintuitive, as instead of the realistic turning while backing up (where it switches which direction is which) we have where it turns in the same direction regardless of which direction you're travelling.\n\nWould I recommend? At this point unless you want to get involved with the development side of things (feedback on blocks and such) or the game is on sale, I would say wait until there's more content and/or multiplayer. I don't regret buying it, but I doubt I will play much more until the game is better developed. However, the direction development is going leads me to believe that this will be one of the better sandbox games out there once it is finished, and I will update this review when I start playing again.","September 23, 2015","false","11.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I do recommend this game for everyone.\n\nPlease Fix\n- TOO MUCH LAG (even with a good pc)\n- over night in the game, it gets boring and if it was shorter I would be happier\n- I kinda hate the concept of having to level up because if you played for hours, you would only get 2 or more levels :(\n- Way to many trees :P\n\nPlease add\n- more blocks (mostly the plane blocks)\n- Boats and seas\n- Structures to explore and maybe secured by techs\n- More weapons\n\nThis is overall a good game but I would be happy to see atleast 1 change from my list going to happen. I mostly want leveling up to be faster and night to be faster but good job on the game!\n","September 25, 2015","true","8.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Or make a giant flying tank hybrid armed to the teeth. It's your choice. Rebuild and improve your vehicle after every fight, or just ignore the parts laying around and continue on your way. Progressing through the game is plenty fun while you unlock more parts and fight stronger enemies.\n\nThe build mode is a unique feature allowing you to edit your vehicle anytime, anywhere. Combined with the vast diversity in parts and the chance to find a new part in every fight, you'll often happily be adjusting and perfecting your crafts.\n\nI only just redeemed my steam key, but I bought the game long ago and I've seen some steady improvements since then. In fact, it was a horrible lagfest with plenty of bugs, none of which I encountered again. I feel like the devs are on top of things and I trust they will finish this game properly, and not let this turn into "just another EA debacle story".","October 8, 2015","true","13.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You build your own robot and fight other Techs to survive in these wild lands, your Tech gets better in Fighting and Harvesting everytime you kill enemies and decide to loot them, The combat is relatively easy however sometimes it gets a bit too easy with Invaders, whos' AI seems to be just "Stop in one place and fire continuously and wait until an enemy gets in range" and with a bit of manual aiming you can easily destroy them with laser fire, this is particularly ironic as Invaders are supposed to be the Techs which are most bustling with firepower and the hardest to beat. Also Suspension on all wheels seems to be made out of diamond rods instead of actual springs, which makes small ruts and ridges annoying to get over when driving with anything but GeoCorp wheels as you'll bottom out many times. which completely negates your mobility.\n\nHowever, the gameplay overall is quite good and as I said, It's an early access game, so no doubt that the developers will improve on it in the future.\n\n7/10 for now.","October 4, 2015","true","39.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That's not to say that they aren't out there, but I've never played something like this before.  It was enjoyable.  I had fun.  However, that hit the wall pretty damn hard after a certain point.\n\nYou see, the game doesn't ever stop unless you're paused.  Even when you're building your vehicle.  If you find that you need to do some major restructuring, then all it takes is one enemy to completely ruin your day.  This happened many times over the amount of time that I have played, which either says something about me or about the game.  In addition, there is absolutely no concept of taking a breather.  Anything you build is doomed to a slow destruction.  You just got through with a boss?  Invasion on your base before you can repair.  Dealt with that invasion?  Swarm of little guys.  Barely finish them off and in the middle of completely restructuring your tech because of damage?  Missed one that pegs your cab before you can do anything even remotely similar to fighting back.\n\nIt's a novel concept, and it has a lot of potential.  Think it needs a bit of a break between fights.  Maybe enemy techs leave you alone while the build beam is active, and actively run from you after you finish a boss or an invasion.  Maybe a co-op mode, so someone can at least watch your back while you're doing your thing.  Until then, I can't recommend it.","October 3, 2015","false","16.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Lame.\n\nYou need to defend yourself a lot, but making some solar generators with turrets and shields can fend off most anything.\nIf you don't make a shielded vehicle you'll spend too much time rebuilding it.

Stop trying to sell your game with ♥♥♥♥ tactics and just make a good game and let it sell itself ESPECIALLY for how much this one costs)\n*Reduce the price. (WAAAAAAAY too expensive for the content you get)\n*2 words (1 word?): Quick save!  Seriously, why isnt this a thing?\n","October 11, 2015","false","19.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
