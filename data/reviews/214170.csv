I’m only writing this because I want to say that I was having a lot of fun with this game. It is really a meaningful RPG filled with excellent ideas mixed with a good story and nice music. What else would we need? The problem is: this game gives you so much freedom (or maybe it is just poorly designed) that you can easily break your quests, even the important ones related to the main story. You can make such a mess that the game turns itself unbeatable. I broke a lot of quests because I’ve done things that ruined them. After that, I sought in the web trying to discover why such quests were broken, then I found these must-read-advices:\n\n•	Don't enter Commander Ralph's room. He'll kick you out and lock the door breaking a quest. A big one!\n•	Don't use the key for the Gardens on the Graveyard first. It causes a break by not then working for the Gardens!\n•	Don't open any one of the four tombs in the holy weapon secret room. It breaks a very hard to complete quest!\n•	Don't kill the assassin before finding the clues (corpses) at the burning wagon and the secret hideaway there; you'll bust the quest!\n•	Don't get the Sword from the Stone and then leave the Dark woods, when you return almost every living thing, including the elves will be dead!\n•	Don't hit the gong before finishing all your open quests, you won't be able to go back after that!\n\nPlease, don’t take me wrong, I like old school RPGs, I’ve played lots of old titles since the SNES, but I never got a game so easily breakable as this one.","October 27, 2015","false","89.4"," 372 of 475 people (78%) found this review helpful 29 people found this review funny","78","372","475","29","27"

"$2.00" it whispered into my ears and I was sold - I knew I had to get this; boy was I delighted with the treat I found in stored for me.\n\nMany claim they can see the end of times upon them with this coming era but I stayed vigilant. I gave hope to the fallen kings of men and entered a realm unknownst to any before me. It was this day that I found out what it meant to be the Chosen.\n\nMy journey started like any other - I was weak, heedful of my surroundings, aware that any danger I find may soon be my very last. Destiny called however, and I knew my place was among the Gods. I stepped forward into a brave new world and accepted the very fate thrusted on me.\n\nOrcs struck, evil mages lashed out with their foul magicks, knights that knew no loyalty saw fit to bring me to their knees; yet I stood firmed. I slayed everyone and everything - from friends to tyrants. None shall stand before my blade and see the light of day again.\n\n"Monster!", they yelled at me. "♥♥♥♥  you", I said in return as I stuck the tip end of my weapon up their haughty buttocks. Tyrants and dragons alike would fall to my sleight of hand as I became the all-powerful, omniscient being the prophets themselves had called to pass.\n\nIn my final hour I would lay waste to the Lord of Chaos. His reign was over and my destiny, fulfilled. Men shall not know the end times again as long as I breathe. With one final sigh I gazed back behind me...\n\nWhat have I done.\n\nIn my wake, nothing was left. I had saved the world but at the cost of the world itself. I was but a lone God overseeing a world with no one - how could I ever be the Chosen when there's nothing left to protect? I fell to my knees and cried; there was only one thing left to do. I pulled out my trusted blade that had been by my side this entire time and made some potions out of the nearby red mushrooms.","January 16, 2014","true","53.9"," 112 of 135 people (83%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","83","112","135","7","7"

Not an easy game though.  Right from the start you will be very easy to kill.  Fair warning, the first few hours can be very difficult and quite frankly, a little boring.  There are ememies you'll be better off avoiding than fighting (and coming back to slaughter them later is pretty damn satisfying).  Upon completing that first dungeon, the game opens up and you can go pretty much wherever you want.  It doesn't get any easier though, so staying too far from the story, right off the bat, is a good way to die.  That story is pretty interesting and evolves over the course of the subsequent games, but I wouldn't go in expecting a story on the level of Baldur's gate 1 or 2.  If you want a solid action RPG that requires a bit of tact and is more Neverwinter Nights than Diablo, this is a solid choice","December 22, 2013","true","12.1"," 63 of 69 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","63","69","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Menycet/recommended/214170/","Menycet","Menycet","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Menycet/","246 products in account","They say that old is gold and I find that this proverb rings particularly true with the hack and slash fantasy role playing game Divine Divinity that was released in 2002.\n\nI'm not sure why I didn't get my hands on this game until now. And I probably wouldn't have played it still for years to come if I hadn't received it as a gift from a dear friend of mine. The best way to describe Divine Divinity is that it's a mix between Baldur's Gate, Diablo and Skyrim. Chances are that you'll love this game if you've played any of them, or better yet, all of them. However, one thing that you should know before diving into this game, is that it's pretty hard and requires quite a bit of dedication and perseverance. There will definitely be moments when you might want to give up and ragequit but try to hang in there and give it a chance because otherwise you'll miss out on a fantastic RPG experience.\n\nYou can play as either a male or a female human and there are three classes - survivor, warrior and wizard - that you can choose from. Depending on which gender you pick, you receive certain starting attribute bonuses, for example, the male character has more strength and the female character is more agile.\n\nAt the beginning of the game, your character wakes up in the cellar of a house in the small town called Aleroth that's home to several healers. Before long, s/he finds out that the leader of the healers has gone insane and s/he is, as might be expected, asked to find a solution to this problem. The story begins to unfold from there.\n\nPros:\n- Divine Divinity has definitely aged well, although I believe that the art style that's been used in the game is pretty much ageless anyway. Furthermore, various patches have enabled DD to be played in widescreen and higher resolutions. The textures are crisp and spell effects still look pretty damn cool. All in all, as far as graphics go, I believe that DD could easily measure up to any point & click action RPG that's been released in recent years.\n- The soundtrack fits the eerie atmosphere of the game down to a tee.\n- The storyline is gripping and cohesive. It sure kept me glued to my screen for several hours at a time!\n- Odd, yet welcome, comical bits that pop up here and there. When I first encountered one of these random humorous encounters I felt slightly confused because up to that point I'd been under the impression that the game was very dark and serious. As I progressed through the game and started seeing these goofy bits more often I just got used to it and dealt with it, so to speak.\n- Lots and lots of sidequests. Some of them are pretty straightforward, others require you to do a bit of thinking, solve some puzzles or do a bit of research.\n- Familiar fantasy setting with various races like elves, dwarves, orcs, etc., that makes it easy for any RPG fan to immerse themselves in the world and maybe even grow to care about the characters that they meet.\n- Although the game has three classes to choose from, you can learn almost any skill that you want. For example, if you've picked the wizard class because you love to use magic but you really want to use a bow as your main weapon, then you can totally do that!\n\nCons:\n- Overdramatic and cringeworthy voice acting.\n- Some very difficult boss fights that might seem impossible to win if you haven't levelled your character properly.\n- The font becomes very small with bigger resolutions and it's hard to read books, manuscripts, etc., unless you're sitting very close to the screen. To fix this, download a font enlargement patch.\n- The interface isn't very player friendly and it's quite awkward to use until you grow used to it. I think that it could have probably been handled a bit better. You can only map spells/skills/potions to the F-keys which means that you've only got 12 keys for all the stuff that you wish to map, and it isn't exactly natural to press those instead of the usual 1 to 0 buttons.\n- There's no button to make your character stand and attack on the spot during combat, so if you prefer to use ranged attacks and you misclick, then you can accidentally run into a horde of enemies and get yourself killed.\n\nIn conclusion I'd say that if you're an RPG fan who hasn't played Divine Divinity yet, you should definitely give this game a go. Perseverance will be rewarded!","July 8, 2014","true","34.8"," 56 of 62 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","56","62","0","3"

Each level offers a unique atmosphere, creative quests, humorous dialogues and vast amounts of different (and sometimes pretty though) enemies. The exploration of the various dungeons with all the loot, treasure chests and secrets will definitely keep you motivated to check every corner.\n\nAnother strength of this game is the character development, which offers plenty of flexibility and freedom in terms of skill selection. Once you have reached a certain level, you can basically pick and increase any kind of ability. For example, a warrior swinging a two handed hammer while casting a freeze spell and throwing deadly scorpion traps is just one of many possible (and very effective) builds.\n\nThe limited voice acting and repetitive (sometimes uninspiring) music should be mentioned as the disadvantages of this classic RPG.\n\nOverall, Divine Divinity can be considered as a rough diamond within the role-playing game genre, although there are some rough edges that would have needed more attention, in order to give it the finishing touch.\n\nAmusing quotes:\n\n“You have a near invulnerability to lightning-based attacks. You can wear a copper helmet and stand in a vat of water on top of a church steeple during a storm, shouting ‘All gods are bloody ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s!’ with impunity.”\n\nTrivia:\n\nDo not attack a cat! Otherwise every other cat will try to tear out your eyes! Must be some kind of telepathic link of demonic nature between them.\n\nAchievements:\n\nWhile the game has no Steam achievements, a useful guide can be found on the link below.\n\nhttp://www.gamebanshee.com/divinedivinity/locations/drelrathshouse.php\n\nChronology:\n\nDivine: Original Sin (PC)\nTurn-based role-playing game\n(Dark Fantasy) – 2014\n\nDivinity 2: Developer’s Cut (PC)\nAction role-playing game + hack & slash\n(Dark Fantasy) – 2012\n\nBeyond Divinity (PC)\nAction role-playing game + hack & slash\n(Dark Fantasy) – 2004\n\nDivine Divinity (PC)\nAction role-playing game + hack & slash\n(Dark Fantasy) – 2002","October 8, 2014","true","48.4"," 61 of 70 people (87%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","87","61","70","10","2"

Beneath the now dated graphics lies a sound game with a complex world, rich lore and funny little gameplay gimmicks that made me smile a lot.\n\nThe good:\n- Rich lore, decent story (if a bit cliché by now)\n- Plenty of content (Took me appr. 70 hours to finish)\n- Pretty extensive and flexible RPG elements (create whatever character you like as you go)\n- Easy to get into, but challenges along the way\n- Lot's of little tricks and secrets hidden in the world\n\nThe bad:\n- A couple of the dungeons look mostly the same\n- Some rare and random game crashes\n- No tutorial in the beginning (some actions in the game could use explanation)\n- Addicitive\n- Rare side-quest breaking bugs (hint: keep a walkthrough at hand)\n\nDivine Divinity is a RPG that is focussed around hack-and-slashing and that is something you do a lot.\nThe world is littered with all kinds of different enemies and dungeons and all have something special. That is mostly because of the lore and quests that even challenges you in small ways you could easily miss. For example: there are many books to find and read, some of them contain hints for quests and how to complete them.\n\nIn roleplaying terms the modern gamer will find various ways to develop his or her character. The game starts with the choice of three classes: Warrior (Fighter), Survivor (Rogue) and Mage (Wizard). But don't worry, once the game is underway, all skills are available for the choosing so you can create any character you wish. For example, I created a powerful mage with great bow skills because I like to keep my distance in combat.\n\nIn terms of loot and interactivity in the world this game surprised me. Pretty much every object that is not stuck to something can be picked up or interacted with. Haven't got lockpicks with you? Just drag the closed container to your inventory and open it later. Found a closed door you can't pick? There could be a switch hidden behind some stacked boxes. Looking for a hidden dungeon? Try under some barrels. Are you out of potions? Use your alchemy skills to create a potion from a plant, etc, etc. There is also plenty of loot. There are the usual magical weapons and armor, but also item-upgrade runes, may different potions, spellbooks, and countless miscellaneous items.\n\nThe game's difficulty level was okay. If you stick to the story, especially in the beginning, you get balanced combat situations and will have plenty of opportunity to find your own style. Enemies don't scale with your level, but have fixed levels and are found in fixed places in the world. If you stray from the path as a level 10 character, get ready to be insta-killed. But don't worry, as you develop your character you get to kick more and more ♥♥♥.\nNote: most of the game you are a lone wolf. The only companions you get are the ones you magicaly spawn yourself. In many a situation I found that some tactical thinking is required to get through combat as a wave of 10 or more enemies at once is not that rare.\n\nLastly I would like to mention the technical aspects of this game. What surprised me is that I was able to play this game instantly after installing it. Believe me, older games often have trouble on a powerful 64bit machine.\nI found the graphics to be charming and 'oldschool' and the sound decent for it's age. I also liked the voicework that was both fitting and refreshing at times (you have to read a lot).\nI only had a few crashes but when you save often that is only a minor problem.\nWarning: this game requires manual saving! No automatic checkpoint system that holds your hand as you play!\n\nI hope you found this review helpful. Have fun with this awesome game!","March 10, 2015","true","74.5"," 43 of 44 people (98%) found this review helpful","98","43","44","0","0"

Don't be mislead by my playing time, it says 16 hrs but I played a lot in offline mode and it doesn't show, I think it's 70hrs more or less and I havent finished all sidequests.\n\nLet's now talk about specific stuff, shall we?\n***Graphics -  9/10 Considering the game age I'd say. Your character's equipment is pretty detailed and so is the environment, you almost never have the feeling of visiting a place already seen, not a single room is like the other, the only exception is for cave dungeons, these have always the same dark rock tiles and walls, and it gets boring after 15 mins, also it's so dark that you have trouble finding levers to open the doors.\n***Sound - 10/10 The music is just perfect, calm and sweet when you're travelling the forest but dark and deep when you're facing demons in the depths of the earth. Voice acting reminds me of theatre plays and maybe someone could dislike it, however it's really good. I had just one problem with sound, which I couldn't get rid of, it was like a scratch sound that played randomly at times, hopefully not too often, I guess it's some conflict due to the game being played on modern machines, but still, nothing to worry about.\n***Story - 10/10 Main quests and sidequests are pretty awesome, there is everything, from monster slaying to the only-talking quests. Some of them are very VERY long and sometimes you find out that completing a quest helps you in another one. There is even room for humor which is quite nice, and this is everywhere in the game, from dialogue answers to stats description, try reading then when values are low. Just once or twice I found myself baffled by the deus ex machina that comes at the right moment to save your skin without a serious explanation.\n***Gameplay & mechanics - 10/10 (unless you break it on purpose) Apart from the chaos of the menus, which is scary at the beginning, everything is just fine, you can build your character the way you like, pick up one of the classes (rogue, mage, warrior) and do whatever you want. The only problem is that there are 2 skill that are game breaking, one is frost and the other one is trap: steel scorpion. The first one makes you godlike by freezing your enemies for a lot of time and the latter one lets you summon minions that inflict an amount of damage that is simply unbelievable, if you also have the ability to charm them so that the scorpions follow you, then you can sit down and let them kill everything. So, don't do that and enjoy the game without these 2 skills, you have many others.\n***Replayable -YES. First playthrough I built a rougue-warrior, but I'm curious to see what a mage looks like. So this is a plus in the overall score.\n*** BONUS *** Steam version allows you to modify the resolution, otherwise you end up losing your eyes.\n\n\nTL, DR  it's 1,69€ on sale and 5€  full price. Just buy it and shut up.\n\nI said SHUT UP !!! BUY IT !!!","December 26, 2013","true","17.3"," 34 of 38 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","34","38","0","1"

As a top-down action roleplaying game it is along the same lines as Diablo; However, it seems to have a more comprehensive conversation system in place, allowing for branched conversation trees. You can also develop your character according to your own personal play style regardless of the class you choose. This is actually not a concept found in many earlier RPG's, which gives Divine Divinity an added layer of appeal. All in All I thought it was fairly well done. It is an older game, so the visuals are not what you have probably come to expect, but the game still has charm and is still interesting and has a well thought out storyline. The background ambience is a nice touch, as is the changing music depending on where you go. I think if you are a fan of old school RPG's you will like Divine Divinity.

Well, they're right.

Destiny places our protagonist in the wrong place in the wrong time, entangling him/her in fight for sirvival, initially for his/hers own life, but eventually for the sake of whole world. And the world is really BIG in this game. You will visit villiges, big cities, wander forests and impenetrable darknses of dungeons. In that time You will meet many interesting NPCs which You can speak, trade and fight, accomplish about 80 side quests not necessarily involving fighting, and even solve puzzles, some involving the physic engine implemented in the game! Did I told the player can even make a camp or decorate his/hers home? No problem with that in Divine Divinity.\n\nI could write a whole article about this game, but instead I encourage to play it on Your own. The best two recomendations I can give are that Divine Divinity was listed among the "Top 100 PC Games Of All Time" by PC GAMER in 2012. The second one is telling You to listen to the game soundtrack composed by Kirill Pokrovsky, especially the "Drunk with dwarven mirth".\n\nHave a nice game ;)","January 3, 2015","true","78.6"," 20 of 22 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","20","22","0","0"

Save it often, else when you die you have to redo all the things.\nThe game will not help you on how to play it. Go read some guides and forums to figure out how the game works. Even if that's not "doing it right," it is how YOU will have more fun. You like solving puzzles and quests; not puzzling out how your stats work.\nYes, I know you like playing blaster mages, but you'll soon learn that you like playing blaster mages when you have another player acting as a tank to keep the enemies from all rushing you. You will be terrified of everything and die a lot.\nWhile Survivor and Wizard look like cool classes, they are harder to play. You have no strategy yet. Go play a warrior.\nWhile the female warrior is off putting in a chainmail bikini, you will soon pick up more armor and therefore be clothed.\nIn reference to the above point, it is in your best interest to steal everything you can get ahold of when no one is looking. There are no negative consequences to stealing if you don't get caught.\nIt is okay to go outside of the village without having finished everything there. In fact do so, kill some orcs, level up, and then go back to the catacombs.\nYour fears about the graphics looking bad are baseless, since you've barely played any computer games in the past decade and this is still what you expect computer games to look like.All in all I'm greatly enjoying myself. I love exploring everywhere I possibly can and this game greatly encourages that.","December 26, 2015","true","5.9"," 20 of 23 people (87%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","87","20","23","4","0"

This very freedom may be impairing for the newcomers to the genre. Namely, investing in utility skills, very early on, could make the combat tiring and the game less enjoyable. That said, you are highly likely to focus on developing your playstyle during the early part of the game.

Play with guides listed below to avoid them.Divine Divinity was released in 2002 and the massive popularity of Diablo II around those times was probably what blocked its possible rise to the fame it deserves. Both games are focused on hack and slash combat with similar systems, like isometric camera, random loot generation or skill trees, though Divine Divinity being a singleplayer game allowed for its world to be built much larger than Blizzard's game's. And Larian Studios did just that.\n\n---\n\nIntroduction to the story (spoilers for the beginning part of the game):\nThe game tells the story of a man without memories who awakens in Aleroth, a town of healers, the leader of which, Mardaneus, has gone crazy and the player is asked for help with finding a source of his madness deep in the catacombs below. The main plot starts after Aleroth, once the player levels up and is able to leave without being in significant danger from nearby monsters. Saved from a dragon riding assailant by a wizard Zandalor, the player learns he is one of the three Marked Ones and they're the only people being able to stop the Black Ring organisation from summoning the Lord of Chaos to their world. To do so, they must gather the Council of Seven - most worthy representatives of all races, who together could help defend the land of Rivellon.\n\n---\n\nPositives:\nWhile the main plot itself might not be the most original out there, the world of Divine Divinity is huge and well detailed and its questlines are amazing, especially when compared to what games usually have nowadays. Players aren't held by their hand at all times, they will receive quests wanting them to enter areas filled with higher level monsters, they often have almost nothing to follow and must complete puzzles in order to advance. Some quests also feature more than one ending. There's also a lot of secrets in the maps, which might reveal great treasures to people keeping their eyes open.\n\nPlayers aren't restricted to any classes. In the beginning you get to choose your model - a warrior, a mage, a rogue (available in both male and female form), with each of them having some different stats and starting skills, but from now on you're not restricted in the slightest - want to be a sneaky thief summoner who wields a greatsword? Go for it.\n\nPersonally I love both the game's art design as well as the soundtrack, both being pleasant to look at or hear. Give the Main Theme a listen!\n\nBonus points to the game for Larian Studios' sense of humour - little jokes are placed here and there through the game, be it in notes, quests or animations. I'd love to share a few of them, but that would mean spoiling the fun and surprise.\n\n---\n\nNegatives:\nThe main problem with this game are bugs. There's a bunch of situations during which you can accidently break many quests, including the main ones, simply by forgetting to do something or even denying a side mission. Fortunately, there are guides which list said quest breakers and let you know how to avoid them, such as the spoiler-light "Avoiding Quest Breakers" by Xendarii.\n\nAnother thing players have to watch out for are the skills. Some of them either don't work at all or are useless compared to others. For that we have the "Skills" guide by Sir Percival.\n\nFor an overall guide (with spoilers) featuring maps, quests, character building information and so on, I can recommend GameBanshee's one.[www.gamebanshee.com]","April 30","true","57.7"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","13","13","0","0"

I enjoyed working my way through the quests while roaming around the land.  Quests in the main story line must be completed in order but the game doesn't push you to complete the main quest (although you will want to do so, of course).\n\nBy the time I really attacked the main quest line I had uncovered the entire map and completing almost all the side quests.  Most of these are found by speaking to NPCs.  "My son has been kidnapped, please help me find him", for example.  Sometimes a clue is given to lead you to the right area; sometimes you stumble upon the area in your travels.  This brings up the only negative aspect I'll mention.  You can break quests by clearing areas before  you get the quest for that area.  Since these are aways specifc locations (cave, house, tree, person, etc.) all you have to do is to avoid a location that looks like it may hold a quest item/person.  Find a spider cave in the woods -- leave it until someone gives you a quest that involves a spider cave.\n\nNice character development aspects as well.

While the game is similar to Diablo in its isometric, hack-and-slash type mechanics, there's a lot more to the game than meets the eye. There's a lot of dialogue, RPG elements, quests and non-linear story progression that you can find in the game.\n\nYou can pick between three (technically six) classes: Warrior, Mage, and Survivor (aka thief). You can play as male or female, and each gender starts off with different abilities. Despite the class system, you can build your character any way you want through attribute and skill points. If you want to be a warrior that uses two-handed swords and casts spells, you can do that. If you want to be a character that's balanced in all three aspects, you can do that as well.\n\nThe story, for the most part, is told well and written well, but it's not particularly gripping. You play as an adventurer who wakes up in a basement in Aleroth, a village full of healers. The town's leader, Mardaneus, has been afflicted with Alzheimer's -- I mean, he's been possessed by an undead mage and he's gone crazy. After braving the village's catacombs to kill the jerk that bewitched Mardaneus, the player can explore outside of the village. The story has pretty cliche elements: an army of orcs is going to attack the human kingdom, dwarves don't get along with elves, evil wizards plotting in the background, etc. That being said, there's a lot of easter eggs in the world, and the game can at least be light-hearted and make fun of itself.\n\nCombat is straightforward, but it can be exhausting at times; you'll be literally clearing through dozens and dozens of mobs in order to get to a single objective, and then you'll have to backtrack all the way through a dungeon to get to the next part of a quest (This is magnified tenfold in the final stages of the game). In addition, the game sometimes struggles with enemy balancing. For example, when you leave Aleroth, you will occasionally run into an orc that is at least ten levels higher than you. After a while, enemy level does not become an issue, but the problem is still prevalent early on in the game.\n\nDespite a few quest-breaking bugs and sometimes repetitive gameplay, I liked Divine Divinity. It's a good game for a cheap price, and it's a refreshing change of pace from the AAA crap that is spewed out in 2016.

Instead of attempting to ride on its mindless, shoddy combat Divnity manages to keep itself at least somewhat fresh with a healthy amount of non-combat activities and quests.\n\nThis doesn't excuse the combat, a repetitive near-grind of slaughtering the same few enemies wearing different skins with auto-attacking clicks and the odd skill, but it does make it somewhat palatable. Biggest gameplay issues is that the skill system, while open, requires an absurd amount of investment in order to be useful while still expecting and demanding experimentation.\n\nI'd half recommend keeping a save editor around, just because to hell with that one quest requiring Telekinesis 2.\n\nEvery point to make in Divine Divinity's favour comes with a matching caveat, a con that pushes it towards mediocrity.\n\nIt's open world (moderately, very large maps to say the least), but with the wholesale reuse of assets and utter lack of interests mean that being open world adds absolutely nothing, quite a bit less than conventional tight level design would.\n\nWandering, indistinguishable mooks that may as well be the same enemy with different skins and stats don't help. There's hidden chests and barrels in the dungeon that contain items, but all the equipment is randomly generated along with shopkeep inventories, meaning that you just statcheck against your current gear, then sell or move on.\n\n"Diablo with heart" - me, 10 seconds ago\n\nPulling the Diablo-popularized "single evolving sprite" of character progression may solve aesthetic problems, but not when the lack of variety highlights every unfavourable aspect of the sprite itself. A giant grey great helm does not mesh with brown plate armour and itty bitty hands. Art design itself is fine - nothing exciting, somewhat gritty, but the 3D rendered models blend in with 2D scenery seamlessly.\n\nCharacter progression focused RPGs are the ultimate in escapism. Ultimately Divine Divinity achieves this, character progression being palpable without being ridiculous and reasonable without being misers with power.\n\nWriting is what drives this game, not the one-note gameplay - and the writing in Divine Divinity, from the questlines to dialogue to the story, is wholly satisfying. The setting, while entirely Tolkien and not winning any points for being so, manages to stay engaging through a novel amount of lore and a healthy dollap of political chaos. Comedy, notably, is tasteful as it is comically relieving from the mind-numbing gameplay.\n\nDivinity has quests, adventures, stories, instead of just a series of thinly veiled errands. But after clearing out the umpteenth corners of empty open world maps, fighting mooks and watching that EXP bar grow as my tired eyes clamored for that Skinner Box feedback loop, the writing mattered very little. During brief periods of lucidity, maybe.\n\nThe one wholesale positive point of the game, washed out by the rest of it.\n\nUltimately, Divine Divinity is a lukewarm recommendation to a very specific - or somewhat desperate - niche, but a recommendation nonetheless.\n\nIf you're clamouring for escapism, to ignore your horrible life for a few days and just exist while wanting a product that's more ambitious than the norm, then Divine: Divinity is what you want. Don't expect it to change your life, but do expect it to help you forget your life.","April 2","true","62.0"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

At first I thought it looked like a Diablo clone, but it differentiates itself from Diablo in many areas.  My playtime clocked in at 40 hours. I ended up skipping a lot of content not because I wanted to but because my character had become practically invincible by Act 3 and that the game simply does not care whether you fail a side quest.\n\nI played the game on a 1024x768 resolution that was stretched to fit my monitor with black borders in the left and right.  Text does not scale well to a 1920x1080 resolution.  This is an artifact from the time the game was created.  The text for dialogue and item descriptions on higher resolutions was not unreadable or blurry, but it was annoyingly small.  Another reason for using the smaller resolution is that the game uses a sight range statistic. This mechanic means that enemies out side of your sight range are not visible even if you can 'see' that area of the map around yourself. Enemies pop up practically next to you when your sight range is low.  This was jarring for me and the problem was fixed with the lower resolution.\n\nWhy would you play a game like this? Because it offers so many different ways to play.  Abilities are not set to any particular class. Every ability can be used by any class and can be leveled up five times.  You gain one skill point per level and every five level you gain an additional skill point.  This system  forces one to make deliberate choices in what skills to acquire and upgrade to create a powerful and versatile character, but there are many successful paths to take.  A lot of the fun in playing an RPG is discovering skill sets and items that work well together.  Divine Divinity succeeds in providing customization.\n\nThere are mechanics in the game that are not explained well.  I highly suggest reading the manual before playing because I stumbled a few times. Items in the environment can be moved by left clicking and dragging it away from its initial position.  I believe that there is check against the strength statistic and the weight of the item to see if you can move it. There are many secret passages and items that are found behind piles of crates, barrels, rocks and haystacks so keep an eye out.  In order to equip runes to gear that has 'charm x' quality, you need to skill up an enchant weapon skill in the warrior tree.  Runes are key to improving resistances and stats your character is deficient in.\n\nCombat is simple hack and slash and provides ample opportunity to kite tougher enemies.  Left click on an enemy and auto attacks happen until it either it dies or you die. Abilities and spells are performed with right clicks.  The game lets you hotkey spells, items, and potions to the function keys F1, F2, etc.  I used these to toggle between melee weapons and ranged weapons and to change my spells.  Selecting a spell through a hotkey sets it for use on a right click.  The game also has a pause function that allows you to change your spell at your leisure.  There is a lot of combat and it is mediocre at best.  The game throws different enemies at you that require different strategies to be effective against and some of the bosses are brutal without preparation.\n\nThe graphics for outdoor environments are highly detailed a nice to look at.  As you explore the musical score fades in an out so you can traverse the wilderness listening to background noises of the forest, fields and cities.  Dungeons are darker and blander.  There are four large overland maps that are littered with quests, monsters and new places to discover.  A few multilevel dungeons give the game its Diablo like feel.  It is a good mix of overland exploration and dungeoneering.\n\nVoice acting is limited  and what exists is woefully terrible.  Despite that, I could not get enough of my character yelling “Fantastic!” every time she leveled up.  The game throws you into a hornets nest at the beginning.  You are level one and the entirety of the starting area is surrounded by level 9-20 enemies.  Discovery of the first dungeon and figuring out how to navigate it efficiently is a key facet to understanding how the game's exploration is supposed to play out.  Progressing to the point of being able to destroy enemies that gave you a hard time is always satisfying.\n\nThe final dungeon was not enjoyable.  It was too long and had too many enemies.  When the time comes, you can run through most of it to get to the ending.\n\nThere is a lot more I could say about Divine Divinity but if I did this review would end up being a tome.  I hope that the review has shown a slice of the depth there is to Divine Divinity.  I can not give the game a blanket recommendation for everyone even though I had fun playing through significant portions of it.","May 15, 2014","true","40.3"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

I was satisfied with my gameplay experience.\n\nIf you like isometric aRPGs, exploring a lore- and loot-heavy world, and fantasy elements, then you will enjoy this game. It reminded me a lot of the Diablo franchise (1 and 2), 2 being the game that I still have played for the longest in my entire life (2 entire summers).\n\nThe aesthetics are good - the amount of detail in the massive game world is very nice. The different effects for spells and skills is numerous enough to keep things interesting. Extra lore is provided in the form of readable text like books and pages, adding to the well-written story. I liked that the characters in the selection screen actually speak out their bios (and that they were actually different for each hero, even though they were simple male/female variants of the mage, warrior, and rogue/survivor). The music and sounds are good, adding to the fantasy atmosphere.\n\nControls are easy to familiarize yourself with, but may take some time if you are not experienced with aRPGs. There is no tutorial, so a new player's start may progress slowly at first. The learning curve is minimal to moderate depending on your familiarity with aRPGs - because the skill tree allows you to select from all three heroes' routes, it is possible to roll/develop a character that is horribly underlevelled/underpowered. I strongly recommend you save often, and in multiple slots.\n\nGameplay consists of you moving around the game world, with attacks hotkeyed to your left- and right-mouse click. For example, I can have a weapon (dagger) assigned to my left-click and a spell (fireball) assigned to my right-click when using my mage. Before you begin your game, you will be able to select a character from 6 options - male or female mage, warrior, or rogue. You cannot customize how they look, but you can change the character portrait. Each character starts with different stats (ex: warrior is combat oriented and has more health than the other heroes), however, you have access to the entire skill network, so it is possible to select abilities from the mage and rogue trees when you level up and are playing a warrior. This allows you to experiment with different character combinations to suit your playstyle. The heroes also have different special attacks (ex: mage can teleport a short distance). When you level up, you can also allocate skill points to your base stats like constitution and strength.\n\nThe game world is fairly expansive, and there are plenty of opportunities to explore hidden areas and dungeons if you are thorough enough. These extra locations are great for farming levels and loot, however, be sure to bring a lot of potions. There is a minimap that you can toggle to help with navigation.\n\nCombat is typical of your standard aRPG - spam your attacks and spells/abilities until your opponents are dead. Enemies will sometimes drop loot like gold and weapons. Feedback is given whenever you hit or are hit, indicating how much damage is traded; experience gain is also shown.\n\nOverall, the game is a very good aRPG, and anyone interested in the genre should definitely give it a try.\n\nRecommend!\n\nCheers,\nDJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews\n","April 30, 2015","true","2.5"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","77","10","13","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aseliot/recommended/214170/","aseliot","Aseliot","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aseliot/","133 products in account","The game looks a bit like Diablo 2 but plays different, instead of holding the mouse to attack you can just click once. You can pause the whole game to relax and take a look at your potions and health (and stats in general) don't increase as so dramatically on higher levels. Also the whole world is not infested by demons and you will meet a lot of friendly NPC's.\n\nIt's a lot bigger than you would think judging by a first glance as there are also caves and underground areas and there are always people around to talk with that can give you something to do despite some of them having trivial problems. I'm level 23 for god sake and slaughter orcs in almost two hits, I don't care about your lost kitty little girl!\n\nThe game does not give you any visual hints of where to go and what to do regarding quests, you should just read the note in the quest-log. The main plot also gets lots a little bit lost when you are running around trying to get quests and level up so you might end up not really knowing where to go and just wander into uncharted territory hoping to get something useful. At least that is how I got through it.\n\nDo however note that the game gets very cryptic at the end you might just wander past stuff you were supposed to be doing something and by pressing alt (to see items etc.) you can't find everything you need all the time. It had me search stuff in the internet otherwise I would've just been stuck a whole lot more times.\n\nOverall it's a really fun game despite the flaws, worth the price if you like to play isometric RPGs. I also have to say that I find the combat in this more satisfying than for example titan quest. Though it does sometimes send enemies at you that are way too strong which you could just defeat later.","January 14, 2014","true","43.9"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/xendarii/recommended/214170/","xendarii","Xendarii","http://steamcommunity.com/id/xendarii/","116 products in account","You can find a comprehensive review of the game below the pros and cons, as well as a summarizing conclusion right at the end.\n\nPros\n+ Overall nice main plot\n+ Up to 60-70 hours play time\n+ Great and varying quests\n+ A vast number of weapons and items\n+ Mostly coherent atmosphere\n+ Good soundtrack\n\nCons\n- Outdated graphics\n- A bunch of bugs and technical issues\n- Weak last story chapter\n- Some world design inconsistencies\n\nGameplay\nDivine Divinity has intuitive controls, a clear user interface (although this does not apply for the inventory) and offers some comfort features like hotkeys, a minimap and a great quest log. The battles are simple, but can get a little bit confusing when you're surrounded by many enemies or have to fight behind obstacles. Also, there's not much tactic needed (and possible) - you either end up clicking opponent after opponent to smash them to bits or do the same thing from the distance with arrows or spells. The game's pretty challenging especially at the beginning though, when you're low on health and don't deal much damage, but gets a lot easier once you've got good armor and a powerful weapon (or spells, if you're playing as a mage). Divine Divinity perfectly evokes your drive for more and better items and constantly satisfies it, since enemies often drop useful things and there are chests full of great loot around every corner.\nThe huge downside of this game is that it's got a pretty weak technology. I experienced regular crashes or hang-ups - sometimes without an accountable reason, sometimes when I tried to open a book or pick up an item. That's annoying, but can be compensated by saving often and on different savegames. What's worse is that some core mechanics are either buggy or completely inoperative. There are some skills that don't have an effect on battles even if they're expected to, others are extremely overpowered and you can break several quests by entering certain areas earlier than intended by the developers or using the (unapparantly) wrong speech options. This worsens the overall impression and tempers the gaming experience constantly.\n\nStory & Quests\nThe storyline is key to every good role-playing game, and while you certainly cannot expect Divine Divinity to have the greatest plot ever seen in the gaming industry, its golden thread is enjoyable and sometimes even a bit exciting. The presentation isn't always perfectly well-made, however - some dialogs seem clumsy, some core parts of the story are treated too hasty and the last (and fortunately short) part of the game is pretty boring and doesn't match up to the rest of the game.\nA huge strong point of Divine Divinity are its quests. They are almost always specific in one way or the other - be it because of an unexpected turn, very bizarre characters or a good portion of humour. The game keeps the typical "Bring me 25 red flowers" or "Kill 20 orcs" quests within a limit, but provides lots of side quests to stop you from following the main quest nevertheless.\nWhile the game's general atmosphere is quite nice and consistent, particularly in certain areas like Aleroth, the village in which you get started, or a huge forest in the south of the game's main region, there are a few things that sometimes take you out of the illusion to be a part of an authentic and comprehensible world. The bettermost example for this issue are the elves, one of Rivellon's most important races, who can get very old, and therefore could be expected to reach wisdom and calmness in the process, but instead mostly act like pubescent humans. Things like these may be dependent on personal preferences, but are one reason why Divine Divinity can not quite match up to the real RPG greats.\n\nGraphics & Sound\nIf the graphics are the or at least one of the most important parts of a game for you, you definitely should beware of even thinking about playing Divine Divinity. I mostly liked its style and wasn't bothered about that it doesn't even look exceptionally good for a twelve years old game, but that's something every player has to decide for himself by looking at screenshots or watching videos.\nThe situation is different with the sound, which is some kind of a two-edged sword. On the one hand, the effects aren't anything to speak of and I experienced a very disturbing and loud noise interference on some rare occasions. The music, however, is always enjoyable and the score has got some outstanding pieces that are capable of adding a lot more atmosphere to the situations they accompany.\n\nConclusion\nDivine Divinity might not be one of the greatest games in history, but it offers many hours of an unfeigend and nostalgic adventure that will make you want to come back to the lands of Rivellon whenever possible and stay as long as you can. The game offers a good mix of story elements and battles to make sure that both Hack and Slay as well as RPG fans will get their money worth and will entertain you with around 60 hours of fun (given you take your time to discover every corner of the world and solve all the side quests). There are some flaws, and some of them aren't negligible, but if you aren't addicted to amazing graphics and don't get frustrated by games with some rough edges, you certainly should not miss out on an exciting journes to this fantastic world.","March 3, 2014","true","102.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The game, even though it's pretty old, boasts a number of features not commonly found back in the day when it came out. One of which has to be the insane amount of environment interactivity that enables you to pick up, take with you or move/throw pretty much anything that's not nailed to the floor.\n\nStory-wise, it's a classic good vs. evil theme where you play a role of one of the chosen ones (yup, you're not a lone... well, not in the beginning at least :)) and you need to help a wizard stop the crazy Black ring cult from summoning the Lord of Chaos.\n\nFor all you Diablo fans out there - Divine Divinity pretty much takes whatever made Diablo II great and implements it perfectly within it's own concepts with a few extra tweaks to make the game unique. There are lots of armors and weapons and the vast palette of skills ensures you to craft the character to your liking. Wanna be a magic wielding warrior? Or a two-hander fighting mage? Not a problem in Divinity.\n\nSteam version of this game is actually a re-release with enhanced graphics and fullHD resolution support (16:10 formats included!) so the game looks awesome, packed with details bursting out of your screen. I'm a sucker for 2D graphics but Divine Divinity really looks and feels warm'n'cousy all the time. Especially while visiting taverns with lots of NPCs to talk to, warm fire flickering in the corner while a local drunkard is trying to woo some poor waitress...\n\nThe game is packed with side quests and tiny details like NPC dialog that help you finish or find more quests which are never set in a way that holds your hand. Instead - You need to explore, ask around and find out for yourself everything that has to do with the current mission that you're on.\n\nUnfortunately, the game has some bug issues most of which are patched or easily avoidable - but there are a few game breaking bugs you might run into. For example - looting an item way before gaining a quest that tells you that the same item belongs to a person and you need to return it. If you've sold it - you can't finish the quest. Or a specific NPC that's vital to the main story that bugs and disables you from teleporting further.\n\nLuckily, the Divinity community is still very active and actually all bugs have a way of "un-bugging" them either by workarounds or simple "cheats".\n\nAs a huge RPG fan, this game is probably somewhere in my top 3 RPGs I've ever played.","May 8","true","32.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","2"

Distracted by the farmer’s dog he didn’t stand a chance, I pounced. The blade of my dagger slid across his fat green throat and he squealed like a stuck pig. I couldn’t help but smirk at the carelessness of this buffoon as I looted his overfed corpse, another victim to my insatiable desire for blood and gold. I wasn’t able to admire my handiwork for very long though, just then the brush began to rustle up ahead prompting me to make my escape. Barely avoiding a confrontation with his friends who had heard his scream, I watched them howl in anger and grief as they suck out whoever had slayed their friend. But alas I had eluded them.

It's a very open world ARPG without a terrible amount of guidance or quest markers. The only handholding this game will do is the occasional place mark of interest on automap if something is mentioned in dialogue thing. Quests are usually straightforward enough, but some require some critical thinking, exploring, and secret finding.\n\nYou can choose between 3 classes (Warrior, Mage, Survivor) with male and female variants, both starting with slightly different innate skills. You can also mix and match your character with other classes' abilities, and make a warrior-battlemage-paladin-thief if you so desire.\n\n\nCombat:\n\nYou got your standard left click on enemy physical attack, character auto-attacks it until it dies. Your spells: Shove lightning bolts up enemies asses until they die. Then you got your Stealth: Lay traps, sneak around, backstab, and poison enemies until they die.\n\n\nExploration:\n\nBeing an open world game, there's a lot of land to cover, but what I didn't expect this game to have is some RTS elements, like fog of war, and being able to pan your camera anywhere in the current level by holding shift, and you can even pause the game to piddle about your inventory to take a potion or whatever. There's also several large overworlds connecting to the main one, and the way you enter them is you walk up to the black-wall-of-nothingness-end-of-level and it asks you whether to proceed to the next area or stay in the current one, reminds me of S.T.A.L.K.E.R, speaking of marked one...\n\nThen there's the teleport stones and teleporters. Teleporters are much like waypoints in D2, in that you just find them and click on them to activate them. However, in this game its not that simple, you need specific teleporter activation scrolls to enable them. Like a couple of waypoints will require a human scroll, and some will require a dwarf scroll, etc. These scrolls don't expire and are simply needed to activate the teleporters, and can be found in various parts of the world, mainly from NPCs that will give them to you if they trust you enough.\n\nThe teleporter pyramid stones are much like a Farore's Wind, except they work anywhere. Lay one down one place, and lay the other one down another place to make a two way portal. You can also just use the one in your inventory to make a one way teleport. Ideally, you lay one down in an area with merchants (like a town), bring the other one with you, and use it to go back and forth to offload your loot and get supplies and the like. You can lose one or the other pretty easily if you don't remember to pick up the one you travel with back up after teleporting back. Man, talk about being anal about using a town portal. I love it.\n\nOther: There's a metric ton of containers to loot, deposit items, and even put in your inventory to bring back with you to make a little home-made stash in your town of choice. As well as a lot of books and manuscripts to read, some being lore, or an illustration, a recipe, something completely random and silly, or something important to a quest.\n\nThere be tons of baddies everywhere to kill, and like a true RPG, some are incredibly overleveled and OP near the earlier areas, until you get swole and take revenge on their never respawning sorry asses. Yeah, it seems enemies never respawn, at least for the most part. This game remembers literally EVERYTHING. So if you're an elite OCD person, you could kill every enemy, merchant, guard, civilian, defenseless forest critter, loot every item, lift every rock (literally), and stuff every container down your trousers, and the game remembers it all. Save files got absolutely huge near the end of the game, somewhere around 50-70 MBs a save, that's pretty insane.\n\nThere's quite a lot of sidequests to take on, aside from the main quest, and at least most of them are pretty interesting and fun to solve.\n\nTechnical:\n\nThe game runs well enough on a modern OS (Windows 7), but it did crash a couple times, and then even worse, a large handful of times a random burst of static played, then after several seconds the game looped the last .3 seconds of sound over and over like it froze, but the game continued playing fine until several more seconds passed in which the game slowed to a crawl and held my CPU hostage constantly using 50% until I ctrl+alt+delete ♥♥♥♥♥smacked the process down. It's like the game's sound gets confused, and randomly holds my CPU at gunpoint. Quicksaving and quickloading after the burst of static seems to prevent it from hanging, preventing a reboot of the game.\n\nOverall I give this an 8/10, an overlooked gem I wish I had discovered much earlier.","May 19","true","47.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Nearly anything and everything in the game can be used, sold, bartered for, or combined. That goes for jugs, barrels, mushrooms, and so forth.

The storyline is actually quite short, but very difficult if you don't sidequest a little. A downside to the game is that some bosses are almost unbeatable if you do not use the skill deadly gift. So somewhere around level 30 you should spend a skillpoint there. While most people argue that warrior is the best class to play, mine is the wizard, since earlygame it provides with a little edge towards levelling, you'll have to find out how to yourself.\n\nThe sidequests are a great addition, sometimes you have to delay finishing one until you have explored some more territories. Some sidequests give hints to main quests, for which you might otherwise have to consider a walkthrough. Using a walkthrough on your first go would be a shame, since there is so much fun to be had finding everything out for yourself.\n\nI rate this 9/10 since even though there is only one campaign, there still is a lot of replay value to be had.","January 16","true","42.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

First off, the world is fairly large, with open areas to explore and an impressive number of side quests to complete. Dungeons are typically expansive as well - the first major dungeon being at least 3 spawling levels with some sub-areas thrown in too. A number of environment pieces can actually be moved (if it has a weight noted, it can be picked up), which allowed for a nice way to hide items/areas without resorting to locked/secret/illusionary entrances all the time.\n\nDD has you choose a class at the start, but you can select spells/skills from anywhere as you progress, allowing you to hybrid to your heart's content. One of DD's strengths is customization - between charms, stats and skills you have a lot of control over how you want to play your character. That said, there are a few skills that are strong enough to warrant including in any build (and a couple that are required later on to finish some quests), which somewhat detracts from the mix-n-match customization as a whole. One rank each of Repair and Polymorph can let you handle almost anything, and one rank of Pickpocket is needed to pass an initiation test later.\n\nFor the most part, the game is non-linear so you can complete and explore as you desire, but you'll find that many locations are way above what you can handle at lower levels. At one point I scoured the countryside killing mobs basically to farm a few levels, which ended up being about 2 nights of gameplay. It was a little annoying that I wasn't working on any major quests at the time, but the map features tons of little interesting areas (most with a small quest/story of their own) which broke up the monotony of level grinding.\n\nThere's a fairly large amount of history/lore to back up the main storyline which was adequate and heroic, but I was disappointed with the game's ending (assuming there's only one) as it was a little vague... though I guess that was intentional to allow for sequel potential (which seems to be the case).\n\nOverall Divine Divinity is a solid title in the genre and provides many hours of open-exploration, quest-completing, monster-slaying, loot-obtaining RPG goodness.","January 7, 2015","true","73.6"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

I've I first played this game when it was in a Games Magazine in October 2005. I've loved it ever since, and It's still my favourite game. Being released in 2002, it obviously can't hold a candle to any new game in terms of graphics, but I STILL love it's looks. I've played it through 4 times before, and just had the urge to play it again, and thought "I might as well get it on steam" and am now writing this review while it downloads ^^\n\nThere are two main aspects that make Divinity to my favourite Game of all times:\nThe First is the incredibly deep World and characters it provides, the quests you receive tell you about their lives, be it the soldier who asks you for a feign death potion, to go home to his fiancé, the Orc who tries to right his people's wrongs, or the ♥♥♥♥ing Brat who asks you to do whatever ♥♥♥♥ he can't be bothered to. All of these define the characters more than Skyrim for example did. Also the two Skeletons that explode upon Philosophizing about how they're held together without any flesh or muscles.\n\nThe second aspect is the Music. In Divine Divinity, as well as Divinity 2: Ego Draconis, the music (composed by Kirill Pokrovsky)  fills you with excitement and tension, always fitting the Area you're in. In fact, my most played song on Itunes it "On the Brink of Defeat" from Divine Divinity.\n\nI can only say that Divine Divinity is a game you HAVE to play, if you're a fan of RPGs in which the focus lies in the story and characters.","February 8, 2014","true","47.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Just like in Elder Scrolls sometimes you will be find random talking animal who needs your help and so on .\n\nGameplay is very similar to Elder Scrools (just in 2D). You can pick almost any object and build you character in many ways. Its one of those games that rewards exploration .\n\nHowever this game is a little confusing and does not exactly tell you what you need to be doing . The puzzles in this game are never easy, you have to use your brain and peace things together .\n\nUnlike more mainstream classics like DIablo2 this game is mechanicly different . You will need to be patient and learn how to play this game right which may be a little hard at first .","December 4, 2013","true","0.9"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

Yeah it doesn't aged well.\nBattles too are similar to Diablo 2. You can only control 1 character and you don't have companions following you everywhere you go. Sad.\nYou also have tactical pause too. Like in Baldur's Gate. In case you need some time to think and analyze the flow of battle.\nThe role playing aspect is pretty good with a lot of meaningful choices that you can make as you travel the world.\nThe world itself is pretty big with lots of secret and side quest in every nooks and cranny.\n\nOverall the game is very enjoyable even though it's a decade old and has lots of bug.\nFYI, most of the time i ended my playing session with the game forced close on me.\nThough this can be remedied by playing the game wihtout steam (straight from the .exe file) and set the game to use only one core.\n\nPersonally i really recommend this game. It's very solid, fun and has decent replayability value.\nIf you are a fan of isometric rpg (and don't mind old graphics), you should play this game at least once in your lifetime.","February 14","true","22.8"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

Now I'm almost 20, and I'm still playing it.\nIt's also (without any of my nostalgic feelings) simply a great game - even today. As long as you don't mind the 2D graphics and the fact that you have to read nearly any dialogues in this game.\nIn Divine Divinity, you play a lost and wounded wanderer, who finds himself in a great battle. A mysterious organisation, named The Black Ring, wants to evoke the Lord of Chaos, an evil and abandonded existence, to surpress the whole country an its population.\nIn fact, the plot is quite exciting and does have many turns. You can visit four great areas and a lot of dungeons as well. You can act very detached from the main quest and spend as much time as you want with side quests or many easter eggs. Also you can feel free to kill almost everyone in the game, as long as you don't mind to be hunted down by the local militia.\nFights are turn-based and you are able to pause the game, which is highly recommended in some of the harder fights of the game. Many bosses do have resistances against special kinds of weapons or magic, so you have to be prepared, otherwise, especially in higher difficulties, you will die very often. Every difficulty is possible and the game is, in my opinion well balanced.\nThe graphics are, in fact, not quite good. Even for 2002, there were games with better graphics.\nSome of the dialogues are spoken, but you will have to read most of them.\nThe soundtrack is a great piece of art by the russian componist Kirill Pokrovsky.

In the way of story and side-quests this has a lot to offer and is well worth the price for the amount of time you'll spend. Unless of course you prefer the high priced games that are over in a day.\n\nThere a few awesome features to this game. The first one I can think of is the ability to choose skills from other classes. I enjoy having my Thief/Mage/Warrior. The second has got to be how entertaining the game's dialog/descriptions are. When it tells me that old ladies could beat me up, just makes me laugh.\n\n","February 1, 2015","true","3.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thorgram92/recommended/214170/","thorgram92","Thorgram","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thorgram92/","354 products in account","Overall, a really solid and enjoyable game; great world, great story, and lots and lots of quests, secrets, and odds and ends to explore, basically everything that makes an amazing classic RPG. That being said, if you don't like the elements of a classic RPG (slower pace, character building, lots of text, running around and, of course, older graphics), this probably isn't your game, but if you do, get this game right now.\n\nI do have two warnings though. First, the magic system is subpar, or at least the combat spells are. They do little damage, but don't cost too much and cast as quick as you click, so as a mage you just end up spamming your right mouse button until things fall over... consider fighter instead.\n\nSecond, the game has a few ridiculously hard bosses. I never actually managed to finish the game as the second-last boss was immune to all my spells, could always blind me (I think it bypasses all resistances), and could insta-kill me and all my maxed-out summoned minions. Getting to a high enough level isn't enough, you pretty much have to be following a guide to stand a chance of finishing, and being forced to min/max really spoils the experience for me.\n\nStill, those are the only things I found wrong. Even at full price, you really can't go wrong with such a gem; just stick with it through the first quest (it'll feel like a bit of a slog at first), make sure you are following some form of guidance for leveling, and you're in for a great time.","December 21, 2014","true","30.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Terrible graphics even for 2002 standards. Can't zoom in/out or rotate the camera. Steam overlay doesn't work which is annoying. As usual for old games, gives you terrible directions about what to do. All completed and unfinished quests are clumped together and some you still have to do will be at the bottom of the  page. The quests don't give you good directions.....some mark where to go but there are many markings on the map and some are for quests, others for landmarks, and it doesn't tell whether the marking is for a quest or not and  for what quest. The story is alright but get into the habit of skipping the long written paragraphs. There is a lot of loot but much of the loot I found was for way later in the game and didn't help me. For this reaosn I did not upgrade much. There are rarities but they don't explain which is which and it is hard to tell, because many times blue items are better than most others even though you see them more often than other colors. There is also little difference in how the equipment looks, maybe because they didn't program for many looks or because your guy is soo tiny. All I know is that I equipped totally different things and my character never changed. There were many quests, but not wanting to mess with the annoying system I had to do a lot of grinding for levels. The play time for teh (intentional Poops) game is very long which is nice. The lack of load times are also appreciated. There are lots of spells and you can mix and match from different classes. Why they even need 3 clases to choose from makes little sense as if you can pick any spells from all three classes, the only difference the starting stats and you can fix that later in the game from leveling.

It is the type of game that you would spend hours playing and lose track of time in doing so. Similar to Diablo and Diablo II in many ways, this is a highly addictive and impressive game overall. There are unfortunately numerous dialogue issues, specifically being those of poor grammar, spelling errors, and even missing responses from NPC's. In addition, the cinematics have very low-quality graphics, which is strange considering how that's usually where you find the best. I have found a couple bugs as well, but they are minor problems and don't really affect the gameplay. Outside of that, this is definitely a game worth buying and playing.

The game also fail to explain its mechanics (Diablo at least had the good Arreat Summit site).\nIf you already played Diablo and/or Arcanum this game will add almost nothing, you can skip it.\nIf you never played any of them, Arcanum is IMHO the best, storywise and gameplay-wise.\nI can imagine the only way to put this game to good use is having an old pc that match the requirements and younglings that never played such games.\nAre there better alternatives in 2016?\nIf you want a vintage rpg go for Arcanum.\nIf you want a dungeon crawler with lots of grinding and theorycraft go for Path of exile.\nIf you want multiplayer action with a lot of skill/knowledge involved go for Dota2.\nIf you want single player action with a lot of skill/grind involved go for the Dark Souls.\nIf you want a fantasy sandbox go for Skyrim and his million mods.","April 16","false","39.7"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

It shows how well thought out it is compared to other RPG games out there, for example in the starter town, you come across a lizardfolk healer, skittering about his shop, worried. you are quickly prompted with about 5 different options to first approach him, each with a unique branching dialouge. In his backyard he has a sentient fountain that is upset it can only heal one of the 2 sick soldiers in town. After exploring an anbondoned house at the edge of town, I found a magic mirror, and a manual hidden under a box beside it. I placed the mirror in a small pond, and tossed the fountain's healing gem inside the pool. The Gem was cloned, and the mirror gone, I used the items to save the soldiers instead of to ensure my own survival as a solo squishy mage. During this whole experience thus far, never once was I corralled into "the right choice" or the "♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ evil choice" that games these days leave you to experience. I wasn't given a maker on where an item I needed was, my choices didn't have clear consequences, and I didn't automatically absorb knowledge from a book simply by tossing it into my bag.\n\n\n9/10","June 23, 2014","true","9.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/recommended/214170/","nerdhouse","Nerd House","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/","2628 products in account","Everyone knows the big-name role playing games: Dragon Age, Oblivion, Final Fantasy, etc. And believe me, I've played them all.\n\nHowever, one of the greatest role playing games I've ever played isn't one of them. In fact, I'll bet you've never heard of it. Even if you did hear about it, you probably never bothered to look at it due to the game's wacky title: Divine Divinity. Divinity is a PC role playing game developed by Larian Studios, released in 2002. The game has everything you could want in an epic RPG: solid graphics (at least for the time), excellent storytelling, engaging gameplay & combat, and incredible immersion. A sequel was released in 2009 which I have yet to try, though I am very much looking forward to doing so.\n\nThe story of the game is probably one of its greatest assets; never have I played a game so deep and involving. Divine Divinity takes on a relatively dark tone, in which the world is experiencing a lot of instability and turmoil. It's typical fantasy fare, but it contains a lot of twists, epic adventures, and dangerous enemies. You'll really start to invest yourself in the characters and the setting.\n\nThe game world is absolutely massive, spanning many thousands of screens. Traveling through the world is also very exciting -- there is no simple "fast travel" system like their is in Oblivion so you actually feel like you're journeying through the lands. There are teleporter scrolls and stones you can unlock, but you'll have to complete some hefty side quests to obtain them. I actually like this design, since it forces you to earn any form of fast travel (I didn't enjoy fast travel in Oblivion since it kind of spoiled me and brought me out of the world in a way).\n\nBut the main appeal of this game is that the world it takes place in simply feels alive. Not only is it large, there is so much going on in it, too, and Divinity does an excellent job of creating one hell of an immersive atmosphere that you can almost feel like a part of. One of the ways the game accomplishes this is by sprinkling little events throughout the game world. For example, in the middle of one of the forests there is a series of gold coins laid out in a "trail" that leads off the main path; if you choose to follow the trail of gold, you'll eventually end up into a clearing where a large group of orcs will ambush (and likely kill) you. Another example -- there is a random human army outpost in the middle of the woods that seems friendly enough -- that is, until you enter. Once you enter, a mage from the Black Ring cult (your chief antagonists in the game) magically appears and casts a mind control spell on everyone, turning them all against you. Little things like this really serve to immerse you in the instability and danger that permeates the land. Immersion and narrative are the chief things I value in a video game, and Divinity delivers in spades.\n\nThere is SO much to see, do, and explore in this game -- I barely scratched the surface of this game...you can easily put 300 hours into this game on a single playthrough if you are thorough. There are tons and tons of side quests, and the game almost requires you to do several of them (since they give you much needed experience points). But do not fear - side quests in Divine Divinity are rarely menial, like the typical fetch quests of other RPGs (gather 10 pieces of wood, kill 20 wolves, etc.). Instead, side quests are like mini storylines with several chapters, and they tell compelling narratives on their own. For example, one side quest involved finding the source of a poison that was infecting a town's population; another had me investigating political corruption within another town. These side quests are meaningful and important, and increase your stake in the game world and its inhabitants. Also, most side quests also have multiple endings, meaning that your choices actually impact the game world. This is another example of how immersive the game world is.\n\nAdding to this is the game's "population"; there are hundreds of NPC's populating the game world, and each one of them has a unique personality to match. They all go about their lives in an organic way, waking up in the morning and going to bed at night (yes, the game has a realistic day/night cycle) Dialogue in the game is more free-form (a la Mass Effect), meaning you can interact with them in many ways.\n\nProbably one of the only issues with the design of Divine Divinity is that the pacing is a bit off, especially in the beginning of the game. This is partly because, since the entire game world is open to exploration right from the start (save for a few areas) and this world is so enthralling, it gives you the itch to start exploring right away despite the fact that you start the game ill equipped to handle some of the game's tougher foes. I remember the first time I played the game, I opted to leave the village of Aleroth (the game's starting point) since I wanted to see the game's vast sights; however, outside the walls of town, I kept dying easily at the hands of any and all enemies I encountered.\n\nFinally, the music score of the game is absolutely awesome; it does an incredible job of setting the darker mood of the game and adds a lot to the immersion factor.\n\nOverall, if you are a fan of games similar to Diablo/Diablo II, you will feel right at home with Divine Divinity.\n\nRecommended\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","August 24, 2013","true","27.4"," 7 of 22 people (32%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","32","7","22","0","2"

In the middle of a battle this slowness really gets in the way and holds the game back. The final nail in the coffin was how tedious the game itself got.

After getting it to work properly, I have to change my review.\n\nI pretty quickly realized that this game is basically a Diablo clone. I quit after about halfway through the first dungeon. It literally consisted of nothing but endless waves of skeletons, other than one short and unsatisfying puzzle. In a game where there is nothing but endless violence, there is no point to playing a rogue or wizard. Wizard skills, for example, other than ones that deal damage are useless in a game that is entirely focused around repetive combat. And even then, you're just a hyped-up warrior who has a limit of attacks (limited by your magic points). Rogues are utter garbage when stealth doesn't even work properly. No, really, enemies spot you immediately and backstabs are impossible.\n\nOh and another thing. You don't get to customize anything about your character. You just choose from 6 options: 3 classes, each with a male or female version. Yes, you heard me right. No alignment, ability scores, races, nothing. You do get to pick new skills and assign stat points when you level up, but obviously this makes the game more focused around XP grinding than actual roleplaying.\n\nYou can talk, but talking is pretty much limited to "Hey, wanna do a quest?" And your responses are yes, no, or to ask for more information. What a complex social interaction, right?\n\nI would be hesitant to call this an RPG. I would probably call it a beat-em-up fighting game.  So if you're looking for the latter, it's a great game. If you like the former then pass on this.","October 19, 2014","false","3.3"," 7 of 28 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","7","28","0","0"

Someone said DD is a mix of Diablo combat and Baldur's Gate questing, which is not a bad description. The quests are mostly "fetch me an item", though, and forgettable. As for the "depth and story", I'd like to know what drugs people played this on, since I could probably get 50 hours of gameplay from a match box with that stuff. The actual story is a bit bad, the dialogue is seriously bad, and some of the voice acting is so bad you'll think it's a joke.\n\nOverall it's a decent example of a late 90's type of action-heavy RPG, but the combat kind of turns into an endless grind and the story/writing is clumsy, so it's difficult to really recommend.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/unsignedint/recommended/214170/","unsignedint","Reptilian","http://steamcommunity.com/id/unsignedint/","245 products in account","First off I have to mention that this game is incredibly buggy or at least the Steam version is, since it's apparently lacking a major patch. There are a ton of quests that don't work at all or are partially broken. Some people even said that they can't finish the game because of some major bugs. Also, avoid exploring an area before you have a quest that requires you to go there, MANY quests can be broken by doing stuff before you're asked to.\n\nI've played this game many years before but I returned to it now after about 10 years.\n\nCombat: You click on enemies once and you also have to spam potions. Spamming potions is mandatory since the developers found it very fun and innovative to not give you health OR mana regen. This doesn't add anything to the game, it only makes it tedious. You only have to spend a few hundred gold coins on mana potions and then you can spam spam spam. Basically, thanks to the game trying to be "tactical" and ♥♥♥♥ by forcing you to use potions, you have infinite health and mana.\n\nAs you can imagine the mage class is probably very fun to play.\nActually it ain't. There are 2-3 spells that are worth your time and they look like crap. Also, you're going to have to rely on melee/ranged a lot since you don't want to waste mana on the easy mobs.\nThe starting spell of the mage called "meteor strike" is a yellow football followed by an ugly looking smoke effect. That's what you're gonna have to use for the first 20-30 levels because most of the other spells are pathetic. The spells aren't satisfying to use AT ALL, it's depressing. The effects are boring to look at, they lack power, and the sound effects don't make you feel like you're actually a powerful mage. You can also cheese the game with Freeze and frost weapons.\n\nThe quests are actually the best part of the game, they're rarely fetch quests or "kill 10 sewer rats" quests but even after you've done them all you feel like you had little impact on the world besides getting special responses from unnamed NPCs based on your reputation level. The reputation system, however, is broken, some quests give you +0 rep and some substract reputation when they shouldn't (you saved that ♥♥♥♥♥ from the zombie? -4 rep for you). Again, more and more bugs.\n\nThe music is great as well, it makes the game atmospheric, too bad the game itself is lacking in substance.\n\nThe storyline is simple and boring, you have to kill a cult that wants to destroy the world. The dialogue is so bad it's as if it was written by a 12 year old, they try too hard to make it sound funny and most of the time it's not. The animations are bugged when you play it on a modern system, most animations are running at very high speed and look odd.\n\n\nOnly play this game if you just want to waste time playing an isometric RPG just for the sake of doing it. It's literally a big pile of ♥♥♥♥, it even has the bugs. It's not even a good Diablo clone, there are better clones out there, like the Sacred series, Titan Quest, Torchlight, Path of Exile, etc. Some people compared this game to the Ultima series so try out those games instead of  torturing yourself with this crap.","December 30, 2014","false","22.8"," 1 of 15 people (7%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","7","1","15","2","0"

All the items blend into the background. It took me 30 minutes to figure out how to progress in one level even though all you had to do was push a lever right in front of your face but it blended into the background so well. They really need something to highlight all interactive objects like some other games have. As it is all you can highlight is stuff you can pick up like loot mostly.\n\nOther than those major gripes, the story seems good enough, the lore seems like it might have some depth to it. The class system seems lacking and generic. Can't really recommend this when there are plenty of better action rpg types like Torchlight 2 or Diablo 3 and plenty of better rpg types like Dragon Age that are just more fun.

You can only restart the game and hope that you will not encounter that bug in the future.\n\nSecond: the last part of the game is really boring and flat, like the 'Hell' part of the first Diablo.\n\nThird: you will face an enemy that is VERY stressing to fight (Josephine). Why want you to stress yourself that much for a game? And if you don't have the right quantities of potions, and the right skills, you will be just STUCK; not a nice way to present an RPG.\n\nBugged and sometimes badly designed.

The coloring and drawing of the areas is really pretty and one of the better looking isometric games out there but the color palette also works against itsself because you can't see many important things that you need to pick up and this leads to back-tracking which is never fun.\n\nThe biggest problem is that the game just isn't compelling at all and the quests are the most stereotypical RPG fodder that turns me off from the whole genre.","December 29, 2014","false","25.6"," 1 of 16 people (6%) found this review helpful","6","1","16","0","0"

Not all bad, but beyond the early game and music, it's mostly bad.\n\nMind-numbing and repetitive gameplay.\nThe spellcasting system is just bad: the faster the button is clicked the faster the spell is cast.\nConstitution is almost a worthless stat.\nI haven't upgraded my gear much since about level 10.\nMore robbery than Monaco and fewer guards.\nThere are some completely overpowered abilities.  Without them, parts of the game cannot be beaten on Hard.\nThe dialog choices are stupid: pressing '1' is correct.  Usually, the other choices will allow you to redo the dialog until you press '1'.\n\nInterface needs more hotkeys.  I have to use AutoHotkey to automate clicking some of the confirm dialogs.\n\nAt least two significant bugs:\nsaving a game when holding more than the character's maximum weight (from buffs expiring) causes the save to be unloadable, crashing each time.\nClicking on a piece of equipment while the game is paused often causes that item to permanently disappear.","June 5, 2014","false","36.8"," 3 of 22 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","3","22","0","0"

The entire premise of the first 10-12 hours of the game is that Healing Magic doesn't work because the "Source" is tainted. Well... I can still go up to EVERY SINGLE NPC IN THE FIRST TOWN, and ask for healing. Fwoosh, flash of light, instantly healed--- that's a spell, boys and girls. The fundamental problem of the story is simple not true. That bothers me a lot.\n\nI'm playing this game from start to finish for a review for my youtube show, but my god. The first town consists of 6 people. All of them are either openly racist, drug addicts, crazy or just casual thieves. And its supposed to be a community of light-blessed healers. What the heck is wrong with all these people?!\n\nThat aside, there's a bizarre sexism in the game. I didn't see a female character until about 10 hours in. Also, in the character selection screen all of the female characters make a rather bizarre "because I'm a woman, X" statement. I don't really care for the underlying sexism about female adventurers.\n\nAlso, if you level up DO NOT SAVE and quit. Your skill points will disappear and you can't get them back. You have to assign them, confirm them, THEN save and quit if you like. The game will eat your new skill points if not. That's a huge oversight, 2002 or not!\n\nIn addition, the bosses I've encountered so far have been PATHETIC for any gamer to come across.\nBoss #1- stands still so you can one shot him.\nBoss #2- one-shots you so that an NPC can save your sorry behind and one-shot him dead while you lay there.\nBoss #3- you can pay him 1000gp and he'll be "at peace" (undead) and not fight you, though you still get the XP.\n\nThere are simply too many problems for me to even give this a passing grade.

Divine Divinity gives the player the freedom to go about the land of Rivellon however they choose and customize their character however they want.

You will do some "fetch" quests and some monster-slaying quests for the local people, who will reward you with experience points, cash, and equipment.  You will spend a lot of time fighting monster mobs looking for experience to level-up, and you will be checking corpses and containers for health potions and bigger/badder weapons.  You have a choice of male or female from the classic character archetypes (rogue, fighter, wizard) and each of them has some utility.  The fighter can carry high weight and do big damage from swords and axes... makes the beginning of the game easier.  The mage obviously can cast some devastating spells to wipe out the enemy, but has low survivability and really is harder in the beginning and easier in the late stages of the game.  The rogue uses lighter weapons and armor, combined with speed... good with a bow.  I have not yet played as the rogue though so I won't say anything about how easy or hard it is.  One thing I don't like about this one and its sequel is that once you kill something or open a box it stays dead or opened.  So you are very limited in opportunities to get experience/level-ups and items.  Other than that, this game is lots of fun if you're into dungeon-crawler RPG.\n\nUnlike Diablo, you actually travel considerably in this game.  You start in a small village, which has a "baby dungeon" below it.  From there, you travel through a forest (inhabited by a bunch of Orcs) and across a bridge (which of course is guarded by Trolls) to reach the part of the world where you will do most of your adventuring.  You have to survive in the wilderness as you travel between several towns and castles, as well as into the sewers and a few other types of dungeons below them.  The story behind the game is pretty interesting, although it's not really great... typical plot for RPG's of the time:  you are "the chosen one" and you have to bring the various races together (elf, orc, dwarf, human) to fight against a greater evil.  You'll be aided by a crazy wizard named Zandalor among other characters.  The side-quests are actually more interesting than the main story, although several of them have you running halfway around the world two or three times in order to complete them.","November 28, 2013","true","151.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Yeah, you have been chosen, but you can pretty much do as you please, without being compelled to be some goody two shoes quest monkey.  Thank Goodness the intro isn't "Only you can save Mankind/Elfkind/society from the effect of violent TV shows" crap that you are faced with before you have even gotten to slay something in most games :D\n\nI played this the first time when it came out, I was young, rolled a warrior, good thing too as this game is hard.  Warriors seem to me to have the easiest time surviving.\n\nThis time I rolled a survivor, and I played like the theiving backstabbing little minx I am.  Justified the fact I like to see what is in every chest , I might not take it, I am just nosey :P\n\nWARNING - the non linear aspect is great, but you can break a quest or even the game if you discover x before y.  And sometimes you don't realise a quest is unsolvable (broken) until much later. I am on the fence about whether this is OK or not.  I mean on the one hand, for example, you nosed around Bad guy's lair and scared him off, so when bad guy's neighbour complains about bad guy you can't take action, 'cos he is long gone (serves you right for trepassing and breaking and entering without due cause, right? :P) but on the othe rhand.. when it breaks the game (main quest line).. Well I would not like to re-roll and glad to say this hasn't happened yet, but if the small quests can still be broken I guess teh main ones can too?\n\nSOME CONS\n\nI have lots more pros, but if you are thinking of buying the game, you probably already know these so... on the flip side\n\nRESOLUTION - The game has not been fully configured for higher resolutions.  I played quite happily on 1600 x ? for some time before realising that all the issues I was having with the quests were due to the map being clipped, I was missing the lower portion of the map.  Also whislt the game looked great even with buffed character vision I was only using a tiny portion of the centre of my screen, basically the mobs only appeared when right next to my character, despite the fact I could supposedly see half a mile away.  FIX - I changed the resolution 1280 x 1204.  This made the game look like it used to and fixed all the maps.  (Right click on DD in steam menu and select configure). WARNING - You may feel older (I did :P)\n\nBUGGY- A shame that this hasn't been fixed, I mean I know this game isn't expensive, but a few of the old problems should have been fixed.  Some are just annoying (CRASHES), others kinda ruin the game experience.  (Got a weapon with a broken enchantment now everything dies with no effort, yes I should destroy said weapon, but my money grabbing survivor wont let me.. grahhh!)\n\nThere are very few cons to this baby, she is old, but she is good.  I am going to replay her and the sequels before husband and I shell out for DDBeyond.\n\nThis was my first review so apologies if I missed something pertinent.\n\nRegards","August 14, 2014","true","69.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not only do they hold true to the genre, hack and slash gameplay in grimdark settings, but they also innovated. Witty and campy dialogue combine in side quests throughout the largely open world. A free form class system ensures you won't be stuck with the same boring archetypes. Puzzles and movable objects break up the grind. A lot of people dismissed this as just another clone when it came up, but it's so much more. If you're burnt out on Diablo 3 and looking for something a little more old school, look no further.

I haven't gotten to playing this game much but this was one of the best and most underrated RPG classics back then. Divine Divinity gives the player the freedom to go about the land of Rivellon however they choose and customize their character however they want. This game was a contender and a survivor seeing how it was able to set the foundations of the Divinity series. If you're into classic RPGs with a good story, flexible customization, a unique sense of humor, and good action then give this game a try; you won't regret it!","December 13, 2014","true","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You will do some "fetch" quests and some monster-slaying quests for the local people, who will reward you with experience points, cash, and equipment.  You will spend a lot of time fighting monster mobs looking for experience to level-up, and you will be checking corpses and containers for health potions and bigger/badder weapons.  You have a choice of male or female from the classic character archetypes (rogue, fighter, wizard) and each of them has some utility.  The fighter can carry high weight and do big damage from swords and axes... makes the beginning of the game easier.  The mage obviously can cast some devastating spells to wipe out the enemy, but has low survivability and really is harder in the beginning and easier in the late stages of the game.  The rogue uses lighter weapons and armor, combined with speed... good with a bow.  I have not yet played as the rogue though so I won't say anything about how easy or hard it is.  One thing I don't like about this one and its sequel is that once you kill something or open a box it stays dead or opened.  So you are very limited in opportunities to get experience/level-ups and items.  Other than that, this game is lots of fun if you're into dungeon-crawler RPG.\n\nUnlike Diablo, you actually travel considerably in this game.  You start in a small village, which has a "baby dungeon" below it.  From there, you travel through a forest (inhabited by a bunch of Orcs) and across a bridge (which of course is guarded by Trolls) to reach the part of the world where you will do most of your adventuring.  You have to survive in the wilderness as you travel between several towns and castles, as well as into the sewers and a few other types of dungeons below them.  The story behind the game is pretty interesting, although it's not really great... typical plot for RPG's of the time:  you are "the chosen one" and you have to bring the various races together (elf, orc, dwarf, human) to fight against a greater evil.  You'll be aided by a crazy wizard named Zandalor among other characters.  The side-quests are actually more interesting than the main story, although several of them have you running halfway around the world two or three times in order to complete them.","November 28, 2013","true","151.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Don't go in expecting the same kind of straight forward clickfest, though, it's a fair amount more complex and there are a lot of mechanics it takes some time (and maybe a little googling) to figure out - such as maybe don't hit barrels with your weapon if you want it to last long durability-wise.\n\nI probably won't finish it (being honest with myself) but I've enjoyed the time I put in. It surprised me right off by having more of a lifelike world than I expected  - day turning to night, hunting rabbits for very useful meat, NPCs aware of me pillaging their goods or failing their quests - and who don't just sit in one place. They put a huge amount of work into this. Since the resolution goes all the way up to my 2560, it actually looks really great. I think it stands up a lot better than Dungeon Siege or Diablo 2, to be honest.\n\nIt's not all amazing - the voice acting, especially for your character, can be pretty weak. The action doesn't feel as intuitive or enjoyable as some other rpgs of the era. The UI overalll hasn't aged quite as well. But overall, especially since you can find this game for 1-2 dollars, it's totally worth checking out.","June 24, 2014","true","7.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A free form class system ensures you won't be stuck with the same boring archetypes. Puzzles and movable objects break up the grind. A lot of people dismissed this as just another clone when it came up, but it's so much more. If you're burnt out on Diablo 3 and looking for something a little more old school, look no further.

Huge game, lots of exploration and details to tiny things that are often ignored by modern RPG games (or for that matter, any game out there)!\n2. Lots of good loots: you will find good loots and even better ones as you progress, not downgraded loots that you see in games like...say...Diablo 3. *angry face*\n3. Very detailed quests. Some of them will make you think about what you need to do, instead of just "go-there-get-that-bring-them-back-to-person" type of quests that you see now. Some quests are very detailed and requires careful backtracking, which may or may not please you; but it shows great immersion to the story telling that it has to offer.\n4. Funny characters all over the map.\nNEGATIVES:\n1. Old school game, don't expect gfx to be like Skyrims (obviously)!\n2. Save a lot. Many quests can be done different ways to get more or less XP or rewards. So try to think before you do them.

The storyline is interesting, character development is open-ended and gameplay keeps you interested and entertained.\n\nBut perhaps what's made me a new Larian Studios fan for life is the Customer Support they offer here on Steam. Their representative, Raze, is always on the forum, ready to help fix any problem you have, if it's in his power... and it usually is. If you have trouble and post your problem to the forum, Raze will answer you within a very short time, offering solutions, including even fixing your bugged character (if you email him your character file).

Don't go in expecting the same kind of straight forward clickfest, though, it's a fair amount more complex and there are a lot of mechanics it takes some time (and maybe a little googling) to figure out - such as maybe don't hit barrels with your weapon if you want it to last long durability-wise.\n\nI probably won't finish it (being honest with myself) but I've enjoyed the time I put in. It surprised me right off by having more of a lifelike world than I expected  - day turning to night, hunting rabbits for very useful meat, NPCs aware of me pillaging their goods or failing their quests - and who don't just sit in one place. They put a huge amount of work into this. Since the resolution goes all the way up to my 2560, it actually looks really great. I think it stands up a lot better than Dungeon Siege or Diablo 2, to be honest.\n\nIt's not all amazing - the voice acting, especially for your character, can be pretty weak. The action doesn't feel as intuitive or enjoyable as some other rpgs of the era. The UI overalll hasn't aged quite as well. But overall, especially since you can find this game for 1-2 dollars, it's totally worth checking out.","June 24, 2014","true","7.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Their representative, Raze, is always on the forum, ready to help fix any problem you have, if it's in his power... and it usually is. If you have trouble and post your problem to the forum, Raze will answer you within a very short time, offering solutions, including even fixing your bugged character (if you email him your character file).

It is the prove that choosing a class for your character in an rpg doesn't need to limit your further character development. It is the prove that you can have story, the freedom of choice, open world AND action in one game. And it is the prove that mad magicians can invent words even imps can't pronounce properly...\n\nWell, Divine Divinity is a 2D game with isometric view where you controll a single character. The game lets you interact with almost any object in the game, has some kind of crafting system, a story, hack&slay-like battles, a character system where your class only defines your starting skills but everything else is completely open to you. You have moral choices, influence on other characters depending on your choices, different possibilities to solve (or not solve) quests, guilds that you can join, conflicts to solve and a world to save from a great plot of ancient evil powers.\n\nIt is a game from 2003, so don't expect too much from the graphics, but everything else can compete against most recent games. Divine Divinity was the first part of the Divinity-series (followed by Beyond Divinity, Divinity II (which was obviously the third part) and Divinity: Original Sin and the Spin-Off Divinity: Dragon Commander) and still I think it was the best part of the series.\n\nWhat you can await from this game? Well, at least around 30 hours of gameplay if you only go for the main story. Some very hard and frustrating fights in the beginning of the game, a lot possibilities to break quests or even the game by doing stupid things you are not supposed to do (so keep some different save-files...) and some mad humor when you are least awaiting it. The game requires a bit of skill and intelligent planning. If you have difficulties, it is no shame to rely on a guide on for example which are the skills that are worth upgrading or which things you definitly should not do to not break important quests, but it is also much fun strolling around and experiment.\n\nDo I recommend the game? Yes, if you have some frustration tolerance. The price tag is always worth it.","December 9, 2015","true","53.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

(Though, this can also be viewed as a con, because the total freedom can lead to actions which break quests)\n-Complete control over the build of your character, starting classes only determine your appearance and starting stats/skills.\n-Great humor.\n-Quests and choices have an impact on the way to world reacts to you, and sometimes the events that unfold, because of your choices, are chaotic fun.\n-Skills are varied, some useless, but most serving their purpose well. (Telekinesis allows you to steal so much stuff)\n-Non-leveled gameplay. Some areas are hard as hell for a reason, dummy.\n-Bad memes and Broken Dreams\n\nCons-Sometimes the only solution is violence. What if I wanna be a pacifist??\n-Bosses become swish cheese, easily. If you know what you're doing.\n-Story's outcome is not affected by how much people hate you.

It is the prove that choosing a class for your character in an rpg doesn't need to limit your further character development. It is the prove that you can have story, the freedom of choice, open world AND action in one game. And it is the prove that mad magicians can invent words even imps can't pronounce properly...\n\nWell, Divine Divinity is a 2D game with isometric view where you controll a single character. The game lets you interact with almost any object in the game, has some kind of crafting system, a story, hack&slay-like battles, a character system where your class only defines your starting skills but everything else is completely open to you. You have moral choices, influence on other characters depending on your choices, different possibilities to solve (or not solve) quests, guilds that you can join, conflicts to solve and a world to save from a great plot of ancient evil powers.\n\nIt is a game from 2003, so don't expect too much from the graphics, but everything else can compete against most recent games. Divine Divinity was the first part of the Divinity-series (followed by Beyond Divinity, Divinity II (which was obviously the third part) and Divinity: Original Sin and the Spin-Off Divinity: Dragon Commander) and still I think it was the best part of the series.\n\nWhat you can await from this game? Well, at least around 30 hours of gameplay if you only go for the main story. Some very hard and frustrating fights in the beginning of the game, a lot possibilities to break quests or even the game by doing stupid things you are not supposed to do (so keep some different save-files...) and some mad humor when you are least awaiting it.

But it's so much better than it sounds.\n\nThe world is huge and full of quests and weirdos and choices and consequences. There are multiple ways to solve nearly every quest, most of the dialogues have good snarky options and the whole game drips with enthusiasm. It may be flawed, it may be ugly in places, it may be silly beyond all get out, but it was obviously made by people who wanted to make it. Larian are probably my favorite developer; I don't know that anyone else is as passionate about the games they make as those guys.\n\nTheir games aren't the best. They're often uneven. Sometimes they're even complete messes. Divine Divinity is no different. But it's got a lot of character. It's got a lot of soul, and it set the stage for all the fun stuff Larian's made since.\n\nThere are games with better combat, with more coherent worlds, with more fleshed-out characters, with more memorable plots, but few games exude the joy and excitement that Larian games do.

A game that still beats the original Diablo in Blizzard's Diablo franchise, this game is quite a bit unique. You can attack anyone you want to, with dire consquences. Move anything you want to, but don't expect to pick it up and put it in your inventory if it's ridiculous. You can do so many amazing things in this game for what it is, you'll forget that any other game remotely like it existed. I love this game because it really has a gritty feel to it at times, a feeling of being lost. You get to make your own choices in conversations, theft, and wherever you go. This game is also very challenging and makes you mad to the brink of insanity, but it's part of the charm. I highly recommend this game even if you'd rather play something newer, because I'll be honest with you, this game just proves my logic: The older it is, the better the story.","May 2, 2013","true","27.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/heath_jeffrey/recommended/214170/","heath_jeffrey","Beyond Malachi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/heath_jeffrey/","23 products in account","A game that would've been great 15 years ago, and was surprisingly okay for nowadays.  The game play is a bit like the old Ultima games.  The world is pretty vast.  There are enough different abilities to keep it interesting.  And the plots and sidequests are intriguing.  It still has some of that old world adventuring - looking for hidden entrances and solving mysteries in addition to the more typical 'get me some herbs' adventuring that's overdone nowadays.  If you don't mind the older graphics and style, it'll be well worth playing.\n\nAlso, don't get too turned off at first.  I found the first 15-20% to be much less interesting than the last 80%.  Give it time to get going!\n\nAdditionally, if you love Divinity: Original Sin, you might enjoy this anyway: although neither is essential to the other, they are set in the same world, and you get loads of backstory here.  The only caveat: Beyond Divinity, the middle section of story, is much less playable.  I'd suggest playing Divine Divinity, then reading about what happens in Beyond Divinity, then playing (or replaying) Divinity: Original Sin.\n","June 2","true","76.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
