Everything is superb:\n* The story stands head and shoulders above what gaming usually offers us these days. Whereas I wasn't going out of my way advertising Dead Man's Switch with all its pitfalls to my friends, in Dragonfall's case the story was my main selling point in word of mouth propaganda campaign I unleashed on acquaintances. The case where main plot is an awesome gripping action thriller that doesn't involve saving the world. Lord knows I'm tired of messianic melodramas.\n* Solid RPG experience with alternate ways to complete runs and extensive use of skill checks.\n* Gorgeous art by Unity engine's standards, cyberpunk eye-candy. The environments are crafted with care and  meticulous attention to details.\n* Top-notch diverse music, fitting the setting perfectly.\n* And now with Director's Cut - finally crisp and utterly enjoyable combat.\n\nOne major caveat is the delivery. The game has no voice-over or cutscenes. It uses text to a great effect. But it uses A LOT of text, so much so sometimes it almost feels like reading a novel. If that is not your thing... you're missing out. :)\n\n10/10","November 15, 2014","true","80.5"," 241 of 254 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","241","254","0","0"

If you are already familiar with the DLC version, skip to the end for my initial thoughts on the new features.\n\nWhen Shadowrun Returns came out there were numerous complaints. Rather than ignore them, HBS listened to the fans and fixed many of them when they released Dragonfall. That wasn't enough for them, wanting to better address the players suggestions they re-released it as a stand alone game and freely upgraded everyone's existing copy.\n\nIn Dragonfall you are the newest member of an established runner team in Berlin. Through the course of events you end up leading the team and hunting a dragon. I could go into more detail, but the story is so well presented you are better off experiencing it for yourself.\n\nRather than repeat the linearity of the Dead Man’s Switch campaign, Dragonfall uses a hub approach. There are a series of missions which advance the plot, but in order to unlock them you need to earn nuyen from other sources. You have a computer which lists all available jobs and its up to you if you accept them or not. Do you do every mission possible and postpone the final battle? Or do you rush through to complete it as quickly as possible?\n\nI recommend taking your time since this is a campaign which focuses on setting. Each of your team members has a strong back story and distinct personality. I spent much of the campaign trying to learn what drove Glory to use such ancient cybertech and trying to get Eiger to stop questioning my leadership. I helped Blitz with his relationship problems and helped Dietrich find his path. You also get to know the community. The hub is not simply a collection of vendors and quest givers, each character has their own personality and needs. The depth of detail means you actually care what happens to the hub, its more than a means to an end (unless you want to role play a heartless mercenary).\n\nOn top of the strong story, Dragonfall is currently the definitive source for official modding assets. It includes all the assets from Dead Man's Switch/Seattle, the Berlin DLC, and more newly added for the Director's Cut. All the props can be used together yet have a distinctly different flavor. The prop selection is strong enough that I can recommend Dragonfall over Dead Man's Switch on their merit alone. Enjoy working with exploding barrels, drakes, new portraits and much more. My only complaints are that the Dragon prop is limited in its re-usability and existing fan made content will need to be migrated to the new workshop.\n\nIf you enjoyed Dead Man's Switch, you will be amazed by Dragonfall. If you were disappointed by DMS, Dragonfall fixes a lot of the common complaints people had. If you haven't played DMS, but like cyberpunk and turn based strategy, Dragonfall is an excellent place to start. I strongly suggest giving the game a try!\n\nEdit - 5 hours in - DLC vs Directors Cut\nBased on my initial impression, I am pleased with the enhancements.The combat interface has noticeably changed, making combat much easier to understand. The weapon interface is much better than the up/down scroll list in SRR and you can easily see what each attack does. Items and 'ware are equally clear.\n\nAs for the flow of combat, I now know exactly when I am in cover and when I have an exposed enemy. Each successful attack tells how much damage was dealt and why. We are told if we have flanking, if cover blocked an attack, and probably more information that I haven't realized yet. I am not yet sure how I feel about the new armor system though.\n\nThe new content seems to be carefully worked in, I am not actually sure what is an addition and what I simply missed in my previous play-through (with the exception of the new face I've met). I look forward to seeing what else is there and will update this review when I have more to say!\n\nLastly there is the new NPC advancement system. I'm very happy with this and hope it is easy to incorporate in my own mods! Yes, we only get two choices per level, but it is easy to understand and use, and seems to provide distinct tactics options. It also makes it clear exactly how they level up when previously it was a bit of a mystery.","September 17, 2014","true","187.4"," 287 of 315 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","287","315","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/brutaljones/recommended/300550/","brutaljones","Brutal Jones","http://steamcommunity.com/id/brutaljones/","178 products in account","I greatly enjoy tactical RPGs when they're done right. I'm a big fan of the Tactics Ogre and Final Fantasy Tactics series, and that plus an affinity for cyberpunk novels are mainly what drew me to Shadowrun despite never playing the original SNES or the tabletop RPG.\n\nI played Shadowrun Returns and enjoyed my time with it save for a few key complaints, mostly around the pacing, shallow combat, and characterization. I'm pleased to say that all of those issues are cleared up with this game, and that it's an utterly fantastic title. I went so far as to recommend that people skip Returns completely in my review of that game and proceed onto this one instead. It's that much of an improvement.\n\nThe pacing problems I had with Returns often caused me to lose interest in the game and stop playing it for weeks at a time. Those issues are completely alleviated here. The game seems to have taken some inspiration from the Mass Effect series, as missions are structured in a similar manner in Dragonfall. Something happens in the first mission of the game that creates an overarching plot, and you're gradually working towards the solution of that by taking odd jobs to build up your bankroll. You're also conversing with your regular allies--something else that Returns lacked that I disliked--and completing missions specifically regarding their background. It worked excellently in Mass Effect, and it really works well here.\n\nThe combat has taken even more inspiration from XCOM: Enemy Unknown, and it now feels far more fleshed out than it did in Returns. Each class has far more depth than it did in Returns, and there are more opportunities to utilize the environment in interesting ways. Some of my favorite missions in the game involved the opportunity to have your computer hacker operate in the Matrix, simultaneously fighting a tactical battle in a cyber world with the aims of unlocking doors and disabling or even turning the security systems to your teams side while they proceed with a battle in the real world. There are some incredibly compelling race-against-time type missions in this game that require that sort of thing. It creates a ton of suspense and allows you to take combat in exponentially more directions than the first game did.\n\nThe characters and the story in this game is the largest improvement over Returns, though. Your squadmates have obviously been crafted with a caring touch, and they feel like well-rounded human beings (or metahuman beings), which is a far departure from the hire-a-mannekin system that Returns did. They've got their own motivations and their own reasons for being there, and they're not always going to agree with the path you're taking. I even feel like I got a deeper roleplaying experience out of my player character than in Returns. I felt like I had more opportunity to inject my own desired personality into him, which I hadn't realized I was missing in Returns until playing this game. Even the minor characters are compelling, from the civilian engineer dwarf roped into a job she has no interest in doing to the loving Grandfather who works as an accountant but also moonlights as an assassin for a loanshark named Meat Grinder, who he hilariously refers to as "Mr. Grinder". Writing is the strength of this game, and it would have compelled me to continue onward and finish even if I didn't really like the combat.\n\nI should also mention the music, which was of quality in Returns but seems improved here. I read somewhere that the composer for the music in the original SNES game did this one as well, which was interesting to me. It's very good, and it properly encompasses the mood of a world that's caringly built as an homage to William Gibson's in the Sprawl Trilogy.\n\nGibson, for those who have never heard of him, is to cyberpunk what Tolkien is to fantasy. His novel Neuromancer, released in 1981, inspired a great many of the ideas included in this game, particularly the Matrix, which is nearly unchanged from those novels. I'd highly recommend the fans of this game pick up a copy of Neuromancer and immerse themselves in the grassroots of the cyberpunk subgenre.\n\nThe only real gripe I can think of is the way the game depicts corporations. It's utterly cliche, uninteresting, and tiresome. Look, I'm no fan of stodgy, bureaucratic, inhuman multinational corporations. But not every company is Comcast. Literally every corporation in this game is depicted as maliciously evil and self-serving to the point where the player is dealing with atrocity after atrocity. The one "good" CEO in the game is promptly fired for not putting the bottom line first. That's just boring storytelling. There's great value in turning the cliche on its head, and it would have been nice to see a depiction differing from norm since the writers did such a good job of that otherwise.\n\nIn conclusion, this is an excellent tactical RPG set in a well-crafted world. It's beautifully presented, beautifully written, and just a hell of a lot of fun. Hairbrained Schemes has met all of the potential set forth by Shadowrun Returns, as this is probably the best RPG I played in all of 2014.","January 3, 2015","true","49.5"," 124 of 131 people (95%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","95","124","131","7","6"

During very thorough game scenario they even improved the weakest segment of the whole reincarnated Shadowrun game base - a decking process. As I played Dead Man's Switch, I felt ripped 'cause of absolutely intolerable concoction of the decking (hacking) part, which was made as simple shootout almost on the same terms as other fights in the game.\nIn Dragonfall, though, I felt much more decking stuff because of many themed situations, dialogs, skill checks and so on.\nAnother ray of light shines above magic part of the setting, which was also improved, by good scenario and thorough paperwork.\n\nAs of the combat part, surprise! - it improved as well! While I've made it through all the Dead Man's Switch on the very hard without even dying once, in the Dragonfall battles became more complicated, to the point when I needed a reload sometimes! Although in general game's still not able to rough you good, even in the way that modern XCom does.\n\nSo! Let's summarise:\nPros:\n- Decent cyberpunk story, fitted in the Shadowrun world as a sock fit to leg. Just as the Dead Man's Switch, Dragonfall is much like a good book you'll be enjoyed reading\n- More than just a story, this scenario based in the 2054 anarchic Berlin, with broth from politics, corporations, dragons, loosen AI, street gangs and syndicates... I can not vouch for the taste, but it will be hot!\n- Get me right: it is not an animated story, it's a solid party rpg, one to be memorized after finishing and catching all the way through\n-Team-based gameplay improved a lot after Dead Man's Switch, as you get your own crew of anarchists. Your decisions will be questioned every now and then, and the more trust you gain, the more powerful your team will be.\n- Comparing to the first game, all the game aspects were noticeably improved, that includes visuals, audio, game mechanics and general logic. No one can calculate fun-from-the-game, but my guess, they improved that too.\n\nContras:\n- game become more unstable, it freezes sometimes, and more you play, more you facing an interference (I don't remember stability issues playing Shadowrun Returns)\n- even with all improvements,\n1) shootouts still not too hard (I've played only on the hardest, and only two times was forced to reload). AI behavior not amazing, to say it politely. Good level design and scripts helping, but not completely fixing an issue.\n2) elves is such an imbalanced gap, which obscures every other races! They got more dexterity (and the best way of fighting is still a bigger rifle). They got more charisma - and that means - more etiquette (more successful skill checks). To put it shortly - if you want the best shadowrunner - get an elf!\nI'd added more race-connected quests and perks next time, if you ask me.\n3) "Matrix runs" still not fitting such a great otherwise cyberpunk game one bit. Good decker should be flowing over the network unnoticed, and not shooting the ices and bringing buddies to cover flanks. That feels like a bull in a china shop every time I'm switching...\n\nOverall: it's the best Shadowrun game on the PC at moment. And one of the best cyberpunk games in existence. And pretty solid Party-RPG. My score 8.1/10","July 2, 2015","true","84.2"," 155 of 175 people (89%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","89","155","175","4","16"

I can quickly and confidently reply: YES, CHUMMER. I beat Dragonfall about a month and half before Director's Cut released. Other than Earthbound or some Elder Scrolls games, I have never replayed an RPG all the way through again. That won't be an issue here.\n\nThe devs have added some pretty awesome new missions that serve to flesh out Berlin even more. New characters have been added and now you may learn more about your party members past. Speaking of your fellow Runners, they can now pick new abilities and level along with you. (choose between 2 advancements a level) This was something I found to be missing from the original.\n\nThere is also the matter of the music. The new music is amazing. The achievements help add more goals to draw you into another play through, but that is just a bonus. There is enough here to bring any fan back. Rare thing for a dev to make a "Director's Cut" with so many improvements and features. Rarer still, one that doesn't charge for existing owners.\n\nNew Players: If you are a CRPG fan or Shadowrun fan, please skip the original release until AFTER Dragonfall. Think of that as a treat or really good UGC. This really is one of the best games of the year and turn based rpg fans deserve a great game like this.

It's improved on every level from UI and mechanics to character development, soundtrack, plot, and mission design, plus a whole horde of improvements in between.\n\nI said Dragonfall was worth it at full price, and it is. Director's Cut would be worth it at full price again, but it's free to all owners of Dragonfall; a classy move from HBS.\n\nThere are a couple scripting bugs which need to get ironed out but I wouldn't let that stop you. Almost all the new content is excellent stacked on top of a full campaign's worth of excellent content. I can't think of a single part of Director's Cut which is a step backwards; HBS did an excellent job identifying "where can we make this even stronger?" and then doing it.\n\nThere's just one flaw: Still can't steal that vase. >:[","September 22, 2014","true","38.9"," 85 of 91 people (93%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","93","85","91","4","6"

Setting presents elves, orcs, trolls and even dragons among humans. But not consider this setting as a high fantasy. All these creatures live in our world and they adapted well to the cold, rigid future of this cyberpunk world.\n\nFor those not played the Shadowrun Returns, Dragonfall is a old-school looking RPG and it presents a tactical turn based  battle system, similar to the X-COM, but less detailed.\n\nAnd for those who played the Returns, Dragonfall campaign is great way ahaed of Shadowrun Returns' campaing, Dead Man's Switch.\n\nGame is much longer, it took my 30+ hours in the hardest difficulty. Story is much more interesting and the free flux state of Berlin is surely a cool place to be in. Dialogs and the descriptions are fantastic once again, and it makes you feel like you are reading a well-written cyberpunk novel.\n\nWhen I played the DMS, I felt the short comings of a kickstarter game. Dragonfall is at it's best to make you feel that the game is developed by a more experienced team, and being a product of a hard and detailed work.\n\nSo, I know the developers will go for a third game. They are much more experienced now. And from my  humble point of view, I would like to write the issues that should make the game better:\n\n- Soundeffects: Unfortunately, both DMS and Dragonfall have very weak soundeffects. The sound of guns are poorly. When it comes to RPGs, I think the environmental sound effects add a great deal of atmosphere to the game. Look at the old Bioware and Black Isle games. When it rains, put a proper raining sound effect. Also when it snows, when it is windy. Add many other exterior sound effects. The sirens of police or security cars outside the kiez, the flames of a barrel, gunshots of a distant gang war... These are minor and not expensive features, but they will greatly add to the game.\n\n- Battle System: For the third installment, I think a much more detailed battle system is requiered. Without any changes to the current system, game's success may be undermined.\n\n- Magic system: Somehow, magic system needs a lot more work.\n\n- Matrix system: Even in the Dragonfall, the matrix sequences were dull. This system clearly needs to be shined.\n\nSo, this is my review about this wonderfull game. Dragonfall is a very good experience. Most of the game, I felt like a I was reading an interactive cyberpunk comic book, and that is wonderfull thing.\n\n","November 23, 2014","true","34.5"," 89 of 99 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","89","99","0","0"

Dragonfall as an enhanced standalone, with a much sexier interface? Shut up and take my mo--... Wait, I already own it. Hats off Harebrained Schemes. I've only just started playing, but the fact that you gave  copies of this to the folks who'd already bought this title potentially makes you the coolest company on the face of the planet. You already had a solid fan in me, but now it's cemented.\n\nNow that the licking is over, on to the game! I'll probably add more to this review when I actually finish it, but I played for a spell, and having already beaten DF as a DLC I can see it is a remake, but very well done. The UI is much less clunky and there's far less guess work involved. The combat flows a lot more smoothly and the status effects (Eg Bleed) are much more evident from the word go. They have done a graphical polish as well, and everything looks a lot more smooth. I'm also looking forward to seeing if they've fixed some of the minor graphical issues from SR:R, but assume that they have on the grounds of awesomeness.\n\nFor those of you who've never played this title, it's a definite buy. When in DLC form it was already a much more comprehensive and enhanced game than the basic adventure (Which was still enjoyable) and has a lot more to offer in terms of plot, depth of characters and a general feel of the universe. After playing this title obsessively I was actually able to walk into Shadowrun, the RPG and actually know the world a lot better, making me seem like less of a N00b, so it is true to the IP.\n\nAs a game? Tactical and awesome. Is it mutable? YES. You COULD hardcharge the door... But honestly my character is a high charisma hacker and I make out like a bandit. Does it actually have a story and character development? Yes, Yes, YES. And apparently even that had some additions in the stand alone. Totally worth it.

Lots of twists, sidequests, and alternative emdings. Make sure to talk to your companions! (for instance, Gloria has an awesome sidequest.) At one point I rescued an enslaved cyborg troll who had an ax and a chain gun for hands.\n\n-The combat is very well done turn-based style. The diversity of spells, guns, body modifications, classes, and companions allows for many styles of gameplay. Also, the inclusion of spirits makes for really fun battles when the enemy is deeply entrenched.\n\n-Runs fast, even on bad computers. On my 2010 macbook I managed to pull 55-60 fps consistently without overheating.\n\n-Good graphics. Definitely not top of the line, but it works well for the cyberpunk atmosphere and isometric view.\n\n-Doesn't hold your hand very much. You have to figure out the puzzles and where to go. But not as open world as Wasteland 2 or Divinity Original Sin.\n\n-Steam Workshop has amazing alternate campaigns and add-ons. Seriously, a few of them are better than DMS which was the original campaign for Shadowrun Returns.\n\n-Console is easy to use and gives opportunities to play with the game to your liking. Big Heads, movespeed, changing sprites, free money, etc.\n\n-World editor is very intuitive. If you want to mess around with making new content, it is pretty simple to understand and grants a lot of depth and freedom.\n\nCons:\n\n-Map for Kruezbar is annoying. Trying to find all the available merchants and running around took me a few hours to get used to and I still can't find the damn cybernetic place sometimes.\n\n-A few freezing bugs. At one point I had to restart a level because the combat system got stuck on an enemy turn. Not a common occurence but definitely frustrating when it does happen.\n\n-Fighting in The Matrix isn't nearly as cool as I was hoping for.

I wholly concur. This is an incredible game with a great story, wonderful attention to detail, and meaningful choices. There are very few other games that offer such an excellent experience, and at 15 dollars for my approximately 30 hours of gameplay, it is quite cheap.\n\nGameplay simply works. Think XCOM: Enemy Unknown and you've essentially got everything you need to know. It's a small squad strategy game with quite a bit of RPG elements. I would have preferred a first person shooter with tactical elements, but I would also have preferred that the developers had a billion dollar budget and a 300 man team, as they would have made it damn near perfect. What we got, though, is a mean and lean game that runs on an engine which allows the developers to create assets and missions efficiently on a tight budget.\n\nI loved the aesthetics and even enjoyed the techno-magic setting, which I thought would be somewhat silly, it is pulled off quite well here. Much of the setting seems to be taken from the novel Neuromancer, although this could be partly because I focused so much on being a decker (hacker) and dealt quite a bit with a certain artificial intelligence.\n\nAll in all I really do love this game, and I recommend to anyone intrigued by this review as well as to the people who like a good story in their games.

HBS masterfully provide a myriad of ways to complete each quests, connecting each story and welcoming you to its lore, embracing you with its universe, slowly and without force. It makes you care about it and you will not realize it until its too late.\n\nThis is a prime example of a simple story done right. Instead of giving you explosions, supernatural powers or meteor showers, Dragonfall gives you emotions, it gives you a sense of ownership, a sense of belonging, a sense of dread, a sense of anger and a sense of exhilaration. Now if you read this and think that this is not for you, then this game is simply not for you. As for me, a true RPG comes from the heart, where your emotions are subtly affected each moment you progress and are deeply affected by it so much so that it makes you think beyond and perhaps your own life. I have never played a game where the companions are so extraordinarily done - these are characters with flaws and grey morality, these are people, these are your friends, this is your team.\n\nNo I did not feel this 5 minutes after I started the game, in fact, I have no recollection of when I start caring, sometimes, having played numerous games, I treat games as it is, just. Games. I played and I played and I care and this game succeeded and that's what matters.\n\nAt the end of the game, I chatted with my friends and we have a good discussion towards the game. We were all surprised that despite the similar journey that we tread, all of us do it for very different purposes. Though we have our differences, each one of us agreed that this is one hell of a game.\n\nDespite its brilliance, no game is perfect, and so I am obliged to tell you the negative points in the game:\n- Camera Options: There is simply no way to rotate the camera in any shape of form, this can sometimes be very frustrating: from not knowing where to go and the miss clicks which do happen more often that you thought.\n- Weak Enemy AI: The AI does not make the best move possible, in fact, it usually does the worst move ever with the exception of the occasional throw of a grenade when your team is too bunched up together.\n\nIt is a blasphemy that some RPG players do not own such a high quality game with very minor flaws and a small price tag. If you consider yourself one, please get a copy immediately.\n\nTLDR: A must-have for any mature RPG players who wants the real deal.","July 29, 2015","true","35.6"," 54 of 58 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","54","58","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lesalanos/recommended/300550/","lesalanos","Trip Hazard","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lesalanos/","382 products in account","Bit of a cautious review, this one. I'm only ten hours deep into a game that I've heard can take upwards of thirty hours to beat, and my appreciation of it hinges heavily on how the story plays out.\n\nSo far, though, I'm very optimistic.\n\nBasic info first. Dragonfall is the expansion for Shadowrun Returns, and this Director's Cut is completely standalone. The game takes place in Berlin, in a cyberpunk future where humans, elves, trolls, and some other races, share roughly equivalent status and co-exist peacefully, at least notionally. Naturally, there are factors - indeed, there are factions - which threaten to destabilise what could potentially grow into a decent world for all, and your merry band of shadowrunners will be at the centre of it all.\n\nCombat is turn based, and during normal play you can only control "your" character, with the other party members following along behind you. It would have been nice to be able to direct them independently, to get a tactical advantage when you know a fight is brewing, but c'est la vie, one can't have it all. You'll use guns, wield knives and swords, cast spells and summon spirits in order to defeat your many and varied foes. To level up you use Karma points, which are earned as they are in every RPG ever: by completing quests. There aren't enough that you can be a jack-of-all-trades, so try to pick a class you enjoy and go with it.\n\nThe combat system is robust, with actions playing out on a tile (or hex) based grid, and plenty of cover to make use of, simply by moving next to it. Flanking bonuses are available, and critical hits are possible on exposed enemies (or on your own team, if you fail to take cover), so it's important to find a decent place and use your action points, or AP, judiciously. You don't want to run out of them and end up stranded in the middle of the room, where everyone can take pot-shots at you. Your team can be equipped with items, such as grenades or medpacks, which can be used at an AP cost and could tilt a fight in your favour. Don't think you can just hoard loads of grenades, though, as inventory space is quite limited. Certain characters will also be able to "jack into" computers and fight in virtual reality, which comes with its own set of abilites, but I've not done much of that yet. It's all turn based and on a grid, though, so probably not that different.\n\nOne issue I've had with the combat is that it isn't always possible to tell whether moving to a particular space will let you flank an enemy. I've had to chance a move on a couple of occasions, and I wasn't always able to flank even though the situation seemed very similar. I think a visual indicator before you make your move would have been a great help - perhaps as a toggle so more experience players could disable it?\n\nThe real meat of this game, though, is the story. Now, as I say, I'm just dipping my toes in really, but so far it has been very impressive. Shortly after the start, there are some jaw-dropping twists which I didn't see coming, and there haven't been any missions so far which felt like filler, or which took place in boring locations or with boring NPCs. The writing is strong, and the beautiful portrait artwork for different characters does a lot more to inspire my imagination that some plastic-faced polygonal goon ever would. There have been quite a few spelling and grammar errors in the script, though. Not enough to ruin the experience, certainly, but enough to stand out and jolt me out of the experience.\n\nWith an interesting world, lovely art, very strong writing and some decent, if not particulaly inventive, combat, Shadowrun: Dragonfall is well worth your time. Jack me off I mean IN, jack me in.","November 28, 2014","true","9.1"," 68 of 80 people (85%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","85","68","80","15","4"

Berlin.  The Flux State.  It's a world of magic, technology, metahumans, megacorporations, and dragons.  You are a Shadowrunner, a criminal who does the dirty work for clients who can pay for your skills.  But things aren't always as they seem, as you'll soon find out.\n\nAs the story unfolds, you'll find yourself faced with some hard choices.  Your clients can't or won't give you the whole story, and moral ambiguity will cloud the decisions you make.  Not only that, the way you lead your team can have repercussions on how they view you.  As you progress through the story, they may open up to you, giving you information about their lives.  I felt like this was really well done.  Your teammates have back stories, character flaws, and even side quests.  It's up to you to say and do the right things to gain their trust.\n\nSince this game is very much story driven, be prepared to do a lot of reading.  It's not voice acted at all.  You are given dialog choices in response to things that characters say, and sometimes it's not possible to know where the conversation may be heading.  Sometimes you have choices based on your character's skill stats and "etiquettes."  Unless you use a guide, you won't know ahead of time whether you'll gain an edge in the conversation or not.  Not to worry, though, since the stat based choices generally are there to make the game easier.  You may gain "karma," which is used to level your abilities, or you might find a way to avoid a fight by finding an alternative solution to the problem at hand.\n\nNevertheless, sometimes you'll have to fight.  The combat system is pretty straightforward.  With a mix of magic, technology, and various kinds of weapon-based & unarmed combat skills, you direct your team to act through careful positioning, defense, and attacks.  How much you can do in your turn depends on your action points (AP).  You can use any character in any order during your turn to fight until all of them have used up their available AP.  Then the enemy AI will have a turn.  Outcomes are determined by your character stats and a "role of the dice," so to speak.  That RNG factor adds a bit of uncertainty, but I never found it to be unfair.  It affects the enemies as well.\n\nIn a late game mission, I was having a blast letting some of the enemies fight each other.  It got a bit hectic, since my team got spread out.  Sometimes I moved a team member around a corner and straight into enemies I couldn't see before.  Depending on how you handle it, some fights can become rather drawn out affairs.  If things don't go as planned, you may have to repeat the fight from the last save point.  The game does have an autosave feature that puts you back at the last point before most battles.  Of course, it never hurts to manually save after a battle either.\n\nSometimes the fights happen in cyberspace.  If one of your team members has the Decking skill, you can explore and fight in the matrix by "jacking in," as the game puts it, at specially marked terminals.  By hacking nodes in cyberspace, you can find information to earn money, unlock doors to find loot, and gain control of security cameras in order to possibly avoid fights. Fighting is a fun challenge, often necessary, but not a requirement for leveling your character.  I recall one mission where my character, a Decker, entered the place, did the job alone, and exited without killing anyone in "meat space."\n\nAs I said before, there is no voice acting.  However, I thought that the musical tracks set the tone for the different areas rather well.  Likewise, the top down graphics are simple, yet effective.  No complaints from me there.  Occasionally, though, the game engine has issues.  While it's possible for your team to escape from a fight if the exit is nearby, I experienced a bug in one of the early missions where all of my team had left, yet the enemy turn went into an infinite loop.  I wound up repeating part of that mission from the last save point.  Another issue I experienced from time to time was a temporary inability to control my character in cyberspace.  I could pan around the scene, but I wasn't able to do anything with my character during my turn.  After a short time, though, it would become responsive once again.  I didn't experience it myself, but many have reported a serious bug that prevents progression in the "APEX Rising" mission.\n\nBugs aside, there are some things that I wish the game had.  Many cRPGs have text logs of all the conversations that you've had in the game, including the dialog choices that you've made.  This feature is sorely lacking in Shadowrun:  Dragonfall.  There were times when I wanted to review the conversation I just had for clues that I might have missed on the first go.  Or I might have accidentally clicked too fast and missed something that was said in part of the dialog.  Another thing I noticed is that equipping an extra weapon to my player character wasn't very user friendly.  For example, my Decker had three slots.  I equipped an SMG, a cyberdeck, and a drone.  During a mission, if I picked up another gun as loot, it was available for me to use during fights and later sell for profit.  However, if I sold that weapon, I wasn't able to equip another weapon that I purchased in its place.  The purchased weapon would be in my stash, but I couldn't equip it without swapping out my SMG, cyberdeck, or drone.\n\nI should also mention that it's possible to customize the equipment for your team to some extent, but only your main character is fully under your control when it comes to equipment and upgrades.  After certain missions, you are also given a choice for each team member as far as upgraded skills or items are concerned.  If, for some reason, you're not happy with the skills available from your base team members, you are also given the option of hiring people at the start of the main missions.  You still get the skill upgrades for the base team members even if you don't use them in missions, though.\n\nI recommend Shadowrun:  Dragonfall.  Minor issues aside, it features a great story and fun gameplay.","November 10, 2015","true","92.5"," 58 of 69 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","58","69","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/positron_/recommended/300550/","positron_","ρоѕιтяои_","http://steamcommunity.com/id/positron_/","291 products in account","Shadowrun: DragonFall is a cyberpunk themed turn based strategy game/R.P.G. developed by Harebrained Schemes and published by Harebrained Holdings. In 2012, magic returned to our world, awakening powerful creatures of myth and legend. Among them was the Great Dragon Feuerschwinge, who emerged without warning from the mountains of Germany, unleashing fire, death, and untold destruction across the countryside. It took German forces nearly four months to finally shoot her down and when they did, their victory became known as The Dragonfall. 42 years later in 2054 a new threat is rising, one that soon has you and your team on the wrong side of a deadly conspiracy just as whispers of the Dragonfall hint that the great dragon Feuerschwinge may still be alive and waiting for the right moment to return. Dragonfall is the next chapter in the Shadowrun series featuring a new story, a new location and a revamped combat system as well as a host of other significant changes. Harebrained Schemes has taken everything that made the first game, Shadowrun Returns, so great and improved on it in every way which should be the goal of a worthwhile sequel. Featuring a unique cast of playable characters and highly memorable NPC's, I really enjoyed Dragonfall's intriguing storyline even more so than Shadowrun Returns.\n\nLike any terrific R.P.G., there are a number of available classes, attributes and skill sets to choose from which allow you to build the type of character that you want to have. For example, the Street Samurai uses combat skills to dominate the battlefield while Shamans and Mages summon powerful allies and cast deadly spells. If hacking is your bailiwick then a Rigger or Decker would be your character of choice. As your player levels up, you earn experience points that you can then use to upgrade a number of abilities for not only you but your team as well. When it comes to the customization of your character Shadowrun: Dragonfall does not dissapoint and this deep level of customization also immensely adds to the replayability of the game.\n\nGraphically, this title is very pleasing to the eye as it's filled with beautiful colors and smooth animation. I've always been a big fan of the isometric turn based role playing games. I like to pick apart the backgrounds and see how many details the developers can squeeze into them and this game has some superb environments and set pieces. For example, with this being a cyberpunk themed game, I can almost guarantee that I spotted an homage to Kaneda's bike from "Akira" and that's just one of the many awesome items to keep an eye out for.\n\nMy favorite thing about Shadowrun has always been the strategic turn based combat and Dragonfall definitely takes what made the previous title Shadowrun Returns combat so great and polishes it to a beautiful shine. The battles are just as fun and even more challenging while the user interface is now much more refined and easier to use.\n\nWhile not quite as cinematic as XCOM: Enemy Unknown, another fantastic title in this same genre, Shadowrun: Dragonfall does rank among the top tier of turn based strategy games in my opinion. If you're looking for a title with a compelling story, thrilling combat, high replayability and who doesn't love cyberpunk then you can't miss with this game...highly recommended!","May 29","true","44.3"," 39 of 40 people (98%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","98","39","40","0","10"

Why, you may ask? Well, let me ask YOU a question, what do you want out of an RPG?\n\nLet's say you want plot. A setting. Dragonfall has you covered. This takes place in the world of Shadowrun BEFORE the tabletop. You're about forty years past the 'Awakening', an event that rocked our modern world and brought forces and creatures of magic back into it. Chief among those were the great dragons,  whom loom over both the setting and this campaign from on high. Along with magic, technology has surged forward, resulting in a cyberpunk fantasy mish-mash where your shamanistic mage can have an artificial eye, your hackers summon digital minions within the virtual world, and your drone-controlling medics can choose to fight with sword rather than gun. This strange mash of the cynical and fantastic makes a setting that is neither too grimdark nor too silly. A proper Shadowrun setting sets a perfect balance of moods and themes, and Dragonfall, fortunately, is no exception. I won't spoil the actual plot proper past what I've already said, but just know that it's full of twists and turns and has a wonderful depth.\n\nLet's say you want party members. A good party can make or break an RPG, and Dragonfall's definitely 'makes' it. You have the dark, distant Glory, wielder of two terrifying cybernetic arms and skilled field medic. There's the aging Dietrich, a middle-aged punk-rocker shaman slightly past his prime, driven by his idol to keep seeking 'the good fight' until death. You have the professional, rigid troll marks-woman Eiger, with whom you will butt heads until you can win her respect. Aside from them, you also have Monika, team leader, local hero, and skilled decker, and Blitz, a former gang member decker/rigger who may or may not be more trouble than he's worth. Oh, yeah, and you also have a dog. No team is complete without a dog.\n\nEach party member comes with their own backstory to explore, along with personal quests. The only thing missing is a love interest, but that's refreshing, in a way. You come to care about these characters because they're members of your team, not just because you want to get into their digital knickers.\n\nFinally, let's say that you're willing to play literally any RPG as long as it actually plays well. Well, then I've got good news for you. Dragonfall's engine has been tooled up to be better than the one that was used with Shadowrun Returns, and there's a deep selection of character skillsets to invest in. Combat is fair and, for the most part, only punishing when you make a mistake. There was only one mission in this game that I felt was unfair, and it was mercifully brief. Levels are well designed and hold a plethora of options that are available to you if you invest in certain skills. The only real complain I have on this end is that you're rewarded experience not for combat, but for resolving quests/dialogue paths. However, this also adds a refreshing twist; this is finally an RPG where you don't have to murder everything to get ahead. At the same time, if you choose to pursue optional combat encounters, there's often a little bit of loot hidden in the area to reward you.\n\nSo, in the end, we have a game that's balanced on plot, characters, and gameplay. Not only do you have those three pillars of quality, but they're complimented by fantastic art and an atmospheric soundtrack. Dragonfall is the RPG of the year for me, and it left me feeling inspired to write and create worlds that are as deep and complex as this. If I had to recommend only one RPG on Steam, it'd be this one. That's how good it is.\n\n... Oh, and that's only the core campaign. Took me thirty-five hours. If you'll excuse me, I think I'll be heading back to try out some of the community-made fare...","October 23, 2014","true","46.4"," 36 of 38 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","36","38","0","0"

People who already played Vanilla Dragonfall should definitely give it another playthrough for stuff like the party member missions and anyone else just needs to get this. (Though I suggest getting Shadowrun Returns first, its good, but Dragonfall is such a huge improvement that it would be hard to play them in reverse order. Also Returns introduces you more to the world if you're unfamiliar with Shadowrun.)

It was a nice introduction to the Shadowrun world and gave me a positive impression, as well as instilling the hope for future campaigns that could expand on the fascinating material(official or otherwise).\n\nDragonfall is amazing. The writing is absolutely top notch, from the characters, to the main story and even the side-quests. The personal character arcs in particular are solid; it did feel a touch predictable that they would all have a kind of tragic backstory to explain why they became shadowrunners but a couple were really well written, and despite all that you're still given the potential to engage in intriguing side-missions.\n\nThe biggest improvement between the two campaigns are the significant amount of options that are available to the player in completing missions. Everything from your stats, skills, race and even class can open up a plethora of special dialogue or interaction options which can not only influence how you get to mission objectives but even the outcomes! It's implemented incredibly well and I had an absolute blast exploring the options at my disposal.\n\nMy only gripe with Dragonfall would have to be the combat. It's well designed, very slick and easy to control with some light tactical touches that give it enough depth and challenge without being over-bearing. However I found myself getting very tired of it about half way through the game: I fell into a particular strategy that was obscenely good and thus combat played out the same way everytime. I often tried to incorporate different characters or explore other spells and combinations but there's just not enough to work with. Again the combat is very well designed, but there's just so little to work with in terms of unique spells or special abilities.\n\nOtherwise this is a great campaign and worth every cent.","October 18, 2014","true","22.7"," 29 of 31 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","29","31","0","0"

Your actions also have consequences that are far more than getting different dialogue lines later in the game and almost all quests present you with choices to affect the game. The downside however is that none of that is big enough to warrant a replay.\n\nCompared to Shadowrun Returns' railroaded progression the game also sees improvement in a form of hub from which you embark on quests, which itself has quite a few interactions with the local populace.\n\nOverall it's almost a proper fantasy-cyberpunk RPG and I've enjoyed it a lot more than its RPG "competition" - Wasteland 2 and Pillars of Eternity.","June 23, 2015","true","30.5"," 30 of 33 people (91%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","91","30","33","2","0"

The story is engaging, the characters are done well, and the gamplay excellent.  I liked the variety of ways you could play through the game as the main character and there is a ton of different weapons, items, spells, etc to keep yourself occupied with.  In fact, I have three new games that are in various stages just so I could play around with things.  Then I hit the brick wall.\n\nI was having a blast with the game on my most advanced playthrough until I came across the "infamous" (news to me) Apex Rising bug.  It happened just as I wrapped up the purge cycle and was hitting the final button.  OK, whatever, I'll just restart.  Five minutes in on the restart and bam, bug time.  I then hit the net to figure things out and find that this bug is famous.  Now comes the five more tries using suggestions from various forums and such.  Still bugged.  I then take one of my less advanced playthroughs to the Apex Rising mission.  Again, the game glitches.  Every time it glitched I was in a different spot and doing different things.\n\nWhat frustrates me the most though, is the copy-paste response from the developers themselves on the Steam forums with still no fix.

Contrast that with the inane "party chatter"  and epic stories in most modern RPGs and Dragonfall feels like a game from another time. You'll learn a lot about each member of your team, and their stories don't feel contrived as they open up over the course of the game.\n\nThere are quite a few side missions, too, for a game of this length. You're given some room to pursue side goals, and your team members might ask you for help with personal problems sort of like Mass Effect but less goofy. This is the kind of game you feel sad about completing because you won't see any more of the characters you've grown close to in such a brief amount of time.\n\nAs for the combat, well, it's a bit simplistic. If you're looking for a tactics game with the complexity of Disgaea or Final Fantasy Tactics you'll be disappointed. Combat revolves around cover, basically. You'll want to keep enemies in clear view while positioning your team to not be shot in the face, outside of special cases like spell casters and ley lines. A friendly or enemy caster standing in a major ley line is a terror.\n\nIn terms of progression, rather than leveling up and numbers everywhere you gain Karma for completing objectives and your team members gain perks every few missions. You can choose one of two perks per "level" for your team to specialize them further, such as having your soldier Eiger focus on sniping skills rather than shotguns. For yourself, you've got more choice with a full spectrum of stats and skills based on which stats you increase. As far as I can tell any sort of build for the player character is viable as long as you focus on one or two things and don't spread everything out.\n\nI ran into a couple buggy situations requiring me to rewind my save a bit, but nothing truly game ruining cropped up in my 20 hours or so of play.\n\nSo yeah, if the game is still on sale when you read this buy it. If it's not on sale buy it anyways, it's the best RPG to come out in years.\n\n","December 28, 2014","true","26.7"," 54 of 73 people (74%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","74","54","73","10","0"

It's called a "Director's Cut". What does it mean? Is it really a full game? As good as the original Shadowrun Returns? Worth a purchase?\n\nYES!\n\nIt would have deserved to be called "Shadowrun Returns 2"! It's better in all regards. I played the original for 20 hours and spend a couple more hours with fanmade campaigns from the workshop. Now, the Dragonfall director's cut campaign took me 36 hours! And I enjoyed every minute. No game in years has managed to captivate me like Dragonfall did. It's not everyones taste, I'm sure, but for me it's the game of the year!\n\nWill it be for you too? You have to like reading lots of text, a large part of Dragonfall is like reading a "gamebook" like they were popular in the 80s and 90s. Then there's this weird scify/fantasy mashup that the Shadowrun universe is: Cyberpunk with Dragons, Elves and Orcs, magic and shamanism. You need to like that, too. But if you do the story is excellent and as deep and well written as you'd expect it from a good cyberpunk novel but rarely find in a game. The choices you're about to make are interesting and mostly tough. It's rarely black and white as it is in so many other RPGs - everything is gray. Morale is a comodity. And even for an opportunist the best choices are rarely obvious.\n\nThe game has it's flaws. The combat mechanics are kinda opaque. A lot of items and cyberware lack the detailed descriptions you'd wish for. So sometimes it's impossible to make an educated decision whether a particular option really is what you want to purchase. I often tabbed out and tried to google additional info but usually to no avail. So even now after 36 hours I've still not figured everything out completely. The flanking and cover system is a little intransparent - oftentimes you make your move and then watch in horror how the follow up situation is totally different then what you anticipated. But it doesn't hurt the game too much. Yes, combat is a bit messy and the UI is a little confusing too but when you end up doing things that you never wanted to do it's frustrating but also supports the atmosphere and storyline of the game quite well. You struggle to survive and try your best to react to the chain of events that unfold mostly outside of your control... you might think you are in control (this being a turnbased game after all with all the time in the world to plan) but in the end that's just an illusion!\n\nNow that I've finished the game there are quite a few decisions I made that I regret. Not only in combat but also story-wise or regarding how I build my character or the suboptimal group-setup I chose for a couple of missions. But those are a bunch of micro-failures that did hurt but didn't require me to reload and in their sum add to the impression that my palythrough was really unique. It feels like my experience was not so much canned and predertermined as in other games but evolved out of my decisions and actions in a complex environment quite naturally. This feeling of having real choices that actually matter is what makes an RPG great and Dragonfall excells in providing that. It also excells in providing NPCs characters that are interesting and that you care about. This game does not spend tons of money on mocap animations, actors and voice acting but employs your imagination to fill in the blanks and that works very, very well!","October 13, 2014","true","36.5"," 23 of 25 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","23","25","0","0"

For example, a minor detail - companions don't give you control over their loadout and to some degree even leveling progression - is genius, minmaxing trinkets on silent slaves, as it usually is, doesn't come close.\nNo stupid "balance", where there is a specific carefully laid out way for every archetype and build, so everybody feels like a winner. Lack of said way for some skills only contributes to overall role-playing experience: for instance i took "etiquette: socialite" and used it exactly once, because i mostly dealt with gangs and security (seriously, what did i expect?).

I very much enjoyed it then. With the free Directors Cut upgrade for previous owners, I thought it would be a good excuse to play it again. I'm glad I did. I spent about 40 hours on y DC playthrough. I thought it was even better the second time around. The new missions were cool, and I think the game improved quite a bit with the upgrade.  The Runners being able to level up along with your character was pretty cool. They get a more XCOM style of upgrade rather than the direct point expenditure of your main character for upgrades. The distinction is cool and works well. Speaking of your fellow runners, they all have stories that you can learn throughout the playthrough that incorporate quests into them. Those were all quite fun I thought.\nThe graphics all look a bit more polished, and everything tends to look better now than it did before (at least it does to me). The UI is significantly better as well.\n\nAnyway, story wise, I thought it was better than Dead Mans Switch overall (although I think the ending of DMS was better).

All are vying for power and any individuals that could try to oppose them are waaaay over their heads. But there is hope: as a Shadowrunner, you will take jobs from these mammoths and decide which one gets to keep their superweapons and which one will have their secrets leaked. It is a bleak setting where life is cheap and everyone is out to get you, but you can make a difference. Just think carefully about who you want to make an enemy of and who you choose to trust.\n\nYou have many, many options to customize your character and your companions will cover your blind spots so you are free to play pretty much anything you want without having to worry about missing out on content. You can also influence how your companions specialize their builds, though you don't get total control over their builds, and some of the most important choices will depend on how you help them resolve their own personal sidequests. By the way, your companions are all very well written, having many memorable lines and moments each. Going into this more would mean spoilers, so you'll have to trust me there.\n\nBetween the variety of character/party customization  and the many, many plot choices you can make through the story the game has enough replay value to go through it at least twice.\n\nAlso Harebrained Schemes gave this out for free to everyone who already had the Dragonfall DLC of Shadowrun Returns and that's a serious show of goodwill when most companies would have, at most, given their previous customers just a discount.

In 2012, magic returned to the world as well as monsters, the elder races of Dwarves, Elves, Orcs and Trolls and of course, the mighty Dragons. This combination of worlds makes for an incredibly rich universe rife with lore and mystery, which can gradually be uncovered by playing through the story and interacting with your fellow residents in the slums. Creating your character is a dull, confusing process as swathes of information are thrown at you with little explanation. There are some pre-defined classes to choose from but these may feel too restrictive for some. Immediately after you are thrown into your first mission; here you are introduced to your crew as well as given a brief introduction to some of the game’s mechanics such as Decking (hacking into the matrix) as well as a crash course in combat. The events of this run will ultimately lead your team down a path of revenge and a search for the truth and it will be your job to lead them. Dragonfall does a great job of telling an emotional, mature story for those willing to read into it, and not simply through the main plot; each party member has their own developed personality and backstory with plenty of dialogue and associated side quests which can also provide them with new combat abilities.\n\nDragonfall’s strongest suit is, by far, its writing. There is an awful lot of reading involved in this game, and even more if you plan to explore all the available conversation options and backstories of your crew. This may put off some people, and indeed at times Shadowrun feels more like an interactive novel than an RPG, but this is merely a testament to how engrossing the writing truly is. Dialogue is consistently engaging, never dips in quality and is frequently accented by multiple skill checks which can affect how the conversation will play out. Etiquettes are another factor which can affect how conversation pan out with different types of people – specialise in street lingo, corporate jargon, academic discourse etc. to better communicate with your team and talk your way out of dangerous situations. There is also plenty of information to extract from the environment if you pay close enough attention. PC databases can be interacted with to search for keywords, open files and hack to access data which provides backstory or could prove valuable in the right hands. Often, finding a crucial piece of information can completely change the way a mission will play out which simultaneously rewards exploration and incentivises multiple playthroughs.\n\nCombat in Shadowrun consists of turn based, strategic battles which offer a fair challenge. All actions, including movement, require AP which regenerates each round. This simple formula is embellished by a cover mechanic, a wide array of abilities; offensive and supportive, varying weapon types and the ability to deal AP damage to enemies, restricting their actions at the cost of less HP damage. For the majority of the game you begin each turn with 2 AP which really doesn’t feel like enough; oftentimes you’ll open a door to find an enemy squad staring you down and combat will begin immediately forcing you to scramble for cover -  as a result, combat can feel sluggish at times as you require a number of turns to correctly position and apply buffs/debuffs. Even then, the low accuracy of attacks is a constant annoyance and results in a wasted turn and an even longer battle. There are a lot of great concepts at play here, Shaman abilities in particular seem to allow for a more tactical approach with powers that can manipulate the battlefield to hinder foes and aid allies. The pace of combat picks up a little late on in the game as more options becoma available and AP per turn is increased, however, when examined as a whole, the combat system leaves a lot to be desired, and is certainly (in my opinion) not the focal point of the game\n\nGraphically, Shadowrun Dragonfall is nothing to boast about. Pre-rendered stage backgrounds benefit from a somewhat  hand drawn look but can often look sparse with limited diversity and in some areas while character models look boxy and underdeveloped. This isn’t a huge problem as most of the game takes place from a zoomed out isometric perspective, but when examined up close, there’s not much to praise. Artistically, the game is pretty consistent and does a solid job of conveying the cyberpunk vibes. This is a grim, dark future where the dereliction and dirt of the slums act in stark contrast to the clinical glass paned walkways of corporate Berlin. The hand drawn character portraits in particular look terrific and it would have been nice if this art style leaked over into the graphics a little more. In terms of sound design, Dragonfall features a predominantly techno-heavy, Bladerunner-esque soundtrack which perfectly matches the melancholic atmosphere and environs of future berlin. The music does a decent job of blending into the background, often merging with the ambient sounds of the mission maps – but listen closely and there are some solid tracks on offer here.\n\nDeveloper Harebrained Schemes have successfully managed to condense the depth and complexity of a table top RPG into a standalone campaign. With open ended character progression, meaningful decisions, exceptional writing and a competent battle system, Shadowrun Dragonfall cements itself as one of the finest cyberpunk adventures available and a terrific RPG in its own right. Well written, endearing NPC’s and plenty of upgrades and progressive side quests drive the experience and keep the player gripped as well as a good novel. While movement can be clunky, text often too faint to see against the background and some issues with freezing later on in the game, the breadth of gameplay available more than makes up for these gripes. Barring a few technical annoyances, Shadowrun Dragonfall is consistently entertaining, challenging and engaging, and definitely worth your time.\n\nPros:\n+Exceptional Writing\n+Fantastic game world\n+Frequent, impactive skill checks\n+Rewards exploration and investigation\n\nCons:\n-Combat can be sluggish\n-Character creation and skill trees can be daunting at first\n-Occasional freezes/breaks\n\nScore: 8.5\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","September 6, 2015","true","29.8"," 38 of 61 people (62%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","62","38","61","5","0"

I discovered after I played and beaten this game that this is a stand-alone DLC to Shadowrun Returns, so this review is also focused on having zero experience with Shadowrun Returns before playing and completing this game.\n\nThe biggest positive for me was the story. The story was well told, gripping, and satisfying. There are some elements about the ending I didn't understand, due to lack of knowledge of the Shadowrun universe (for most of the game I assumed when they referred to "dragons" that they referred to some sort of augmented superperson.. not actual dragons themselves). The core characters are supremely polished and satisfying.\n\nThe world is realized very well with fun and immersive environments. There were a lot of options on how to finish each mission and I really felt my choices had an impact on the story, even at the mission level.\n\nI'm generally not a fan of tactical combat. The combat is in this game, while not amazing, is pretty good. I realized pretty quickly that there is no "RPG" benefit to combat, and if you could it was generally best to avoid it. The game gives you lots of (sometime subtle) options on avoiding combat.\n\nI ran as a Decker: a character who jacks into systems to control them. One flaw in the game was that I'm sure I went 10-15 hours into it before the first time I could jack into something, so my character was kinda underpowered otherwise as most of his skill was in decking.\n\nThis game is a great value. A great story with fascinating characters (you often delve into their backstories quite a bit) and an immersive world that you feel like you actually have an impact in.\n\nHighly recommend.","December 27, 2014","true","28.9"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","14","18","0","0"

The layout of the weapons and items/spells is all out on the bottom screen so it's a little bit easier for you to access them and a little bit quicker so it's a plus.

A lot.\n●▬▬▬▬ஜ۩۞۩ஜ▬▬▬▬●\n×°×★Summary Review★×°×\nOverall Rating: ★★★★☆ [4/5]\nStory: ★★★★★\nGameplay: ★★★☆☆\nSound: ★★★★★\n●▬▬▬▬ஜ۩۞۩ஜ▬▬▬▬●\n★OVERALL★\nReminiscent of expansion packs in the 1990's, Dragonfall is a standalone story staying true to the already established world within the previously released Shadowrun Returns. With over 30 hours of content, Harebrained Schemes has given us an entirely new game, instead of some ill-developed cash-grab DLC that's all too popular these days. A small studio that started out as a kickstarter has achieved something that other, much larger developers repeatably fail to do: make a great video game. It's immersive. It's authentic. And most importantly, it's fun!\n\n★STORY★\nYou start out as a shadowrunner set in a futuristic Berlin. The year is 2054. Unlike towns such as Seattle, Washington, the Flux-State is a home to anarchists. It’s a place where power is constantly shifting, poverty and profit go hand-in-hand, and the only law around is dog eat dog. It's a gangsters paradise. But it's not all paydays and parties. Rumors have been spreading across the message boards about the long dead Feuerschwinge’s return. One of the meanest, most powerful Great Dragons that ever existed. The aptly named "Firewing" nearly destroyed Germany 42 years ago when her rampage killed hundreds of thousands. But her hubris was her downfall. And if she survived, she'll be back with avengeance for her day of defeat, forever known as "Dragonfall."\n\nWith top-notch writing, interesting and complex characters, Shadowrun: Dragonfall boasts an immersive, compelling story that is disturbing one minute, then humorous the next. Drama, romance, and betrayal. Dragonfall has it all and then some.\n\n★GAMEPLAY★\nListed as a "tactical turn-based role-playing" game, you might be a little surprised at what you find. I've come to think of the Shadowrun Returns series more as an interactive virtual novel with tactical and roleplaying elements. Because the true lure of this game is not the gameplay, but the story. I'm not saying that it's bad, it's just not what makes the game entertaining. While you're able to change some elements of the story to your own unique perspective, the main storyline arc remains similar. And customizing your character has little impact on how the story develops, instead offering a different perspective on the same events.\n\nAt best, the combat is a distracting requirement to continue the story. At worst, it will make you want to pull your hair out. In the end, this is not a great tactical turn-based shooter. It is, however, one of the best stories you'll ever experience in a video game.\n\n★SOUND & MUSIC★\nOnce again we're treated to the talents of Jon Everist, who was one of the three original composers for Shadowrun Returns. The music is so perfectly in tune with the world's futuristic, steampunk backdrop that it fits in seamlessly with the first game's soundtrack. It's so good that I bought the Director's Cut version of Shadowrun: Dragonfall just to own the music.\n\nAside from the music, the sound effects for the game are satisfying. The wet meaty crunch as your enemy is dismembered by a close-range shotgun blast. The ominous tribal drumbeat that fills the air as your mage summons an elemental. And the cyberistic chirps of IC attacks within the Matrix. It's all very well done.\n\n★BUGS & BOTHERS★\nIt's been over a year since Dragonfall's release, but sadly, there are still a number of bothersome bugs and irksome annoyances that keep this game from being a perfect 5 out of 5.\n\nMost notably of which is "the Apex" bug. Which refers to a game-breaking bug that occurs during the main storyline mission, "Apex Rising." You must complete this mission in order to finish the game, and therein lies the problem. The developers have acknowledged that this is a serious issue and they're still working on a fix to this very day. However, we've been given a work around: Don't save during the mission. I know, it sounds counter-intuitive, but a lot of players have confirmed that it works.\n\nAnother annoyance is the multiple layers of RNG (Random Number Generator). Since Shadowrun began as a pen & paper RPG, similar to D&D, random numbers rule the game in the form of dice rolls. Then came along Shadowrun Returns (the video game) and its tactical turn-based RPG model. The problem is that the game has multiple layers of RNG stacked upon each other. Combine this with a lack of combat information to tell you whether or not you missed, hit, or the target dodged you're left with a rather misleading percent chance to hit marker. And since the Dodge skill is calculated *after* the attack, even a 99% chance to hit (the highest possible within the game) can be completely false.\n\nBut if you can move past this flaw, you'll find a rich story within a unique, futuristic fantasy world. And I firmly believe that the Shadowrun: Dragonfall is a much improved addition to the Shadowrun Returns trilogy.","December 14, 2015","true","40.9"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","11","13","0","0"

The world is beautiful as it is deadly.\n\nThe writing is excellent. Only in few other RPG's has a few lines of text set the mood so perfectly. Goes to show you don't need to spend truckloads of money on motion capture and voice over talent to create a good game.\n\nThe few issues I have is that combat can be rather boring. Certain skills outperform others and combat has a tendency to drag on needlessly sometimes what with enemies hiding in heavy cover. I also take issue with the fact that enemies seem to have an endless supply of grenades. Flashbangs in particular.\n\nThe interaction cursor is rather wonky at times. I've lost track of the times I wanted to pick something up but my character just moves over to the spot and stands there.\n\nCertain classes are also a lot better than others, the balance between them isn't really that good.\n\nAll in all, this is a great game. If you are a Pen-and-paper old schooler like myself you'll love this game. If you're not and are simply looking for a good RPG, then pick this up. You will not regret it.\n\nFinal verdict: 8/10.

Thankfully, if you own Shadowrun Returns, it's very easy to copy the relevant files over, and play the older campaign with all the system perks of the re-launch.\n\nAbsolutely recommended if you like CRPGS, Shadowrun or Cyberpunk in general.

You don't need a Triple-A budget, voice acting, or sandbox world to create a compelling and emotional journey.\n\nLet's be clear on one thing - Dragonfall is the kind of game nearly anyone would describe as "old school". It's based on a pen-and-paper RPG system, it has no voice acting and thus relies on oodles of text to breathe life into its' world, and combat is slower than what many would like. Add to this that the game's bugs can be aggravating at times and you got a bit of an underwhelming first impression.\n\nWhat makes Dragonfall a strong game is that it has a beating heart and soul underneath that bulky exterior. There is no attempt to flash and dazzle you - the story is a slow-burning powder keg that builds tension, filling itself with wonderful and memorable characters who feel more like people than RPG archetypes. From your companions, to the allies you meet, to the antagonistic forces at play everyone feels like they're following agendas fueled by motive and goals. The world is bleak and sometimes empty, but the prose employed and the dialogue you partake in paints a vivid picture in the same way reading a sharply written novel might evoke form and feeling.\n\nThe story and characters all avoid becoming trope-filled messes, instead raising themselves head and shoulders above many of its' peers. Hours faded away as I became engrossed in discovering more about them, while the thoughtful and well-executed pacing kept me from even so much as thinking about putting the game down to do anything else until I was done.\n\nThe combat will not be the most incredible tactical action you'll ever play in your life, but it will be consistenly rewarding and challenging and it will never steal from you your time with unnecessary warfare. You will not be fighting hundreds of battles, room after room, as you slog towards your goals. Everything you see and do has substance to it, a clear purpose.\n\nIf only I could say that everyone should play it, but we all know there isn't a game for which that's true. But if you want to play an RPG that really delivers on the narrative front - that will make you forget your life for a brief while and actually believe you're a part of someone else's lives, that you're part of something frightening and important - then this is a story worth giving a chance to.\n\n\nTL;DR Great gameplay. Fulfilling character progression. Wonderful music. Amazing writing. A new favorite without a doubt.","September 19, 2015","true","31.2"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","0"

Returns had a game breaking bug in iOS which was never resolved.  Even on the PC, it looks like Dragonfall: DC follows their trend of poor quality testing.  At the end one particularly long and difficult quest, a hacked door could not be interacted with - resulting in a failure of the quest and going back to an old save and slogging through it all over again.  Now another quest will let you try but mysteriously removes the one item you need to actually solve it ... again wasting time and making the quest unbeatable.\n\nConsidering how long this game has been on the shelf it seems like HBS has no real interest in fixing these game breaking bugs.  I'm not holding my breath and certainly never giving them my money again.\n\nSo no, I don't recommend Dragonfall or any other HBS game ever again.

Rarely have I been more thankful that I went back to a game, it is now one of my favourite RPG's!\n\nThe game has some design quirks that can initially frustrate, you will get over these and may even like the simplistic streamlining of your team members level progression by it's end. Combat is mostly solid but I did find it was at it's best when I played as a mage/shaman, though it was probably easier in the early sections as a samurai with the opposite being true in the game's latter stages.\n\nSome will tell of the APEX quest crash which thankfully did not happen in either of my two play throughs. I did what the devs said, no quick saves in this quest, regular save as little as possible, and make a back up before you embark as an extra precaution.\n\nThe story is good with many well thought out moral dilemmas that give your character a fully fledged selection of well fitting choices for the situation that they are in. One of the places where Fallout 4(which on the whole I enjoyed a great deal!) seemed to get things a little bit wrong.\n\nIt has several endings, one of which stands out as possibly my favourite of any RPG ever.

Basically, it takes place in a cyberpunk future where magic (specifically, dungeons and dragons style magic) has entered the world.  Think if William Gibson and Gary Gygaxes imaginations had a baby.  Lil' Willgar Gibgax.\nThe game itself is an RPG with turn based combat, with real time exploration smoothly (for the most part) transitioning to turn based when the combat starts.\nThe campaign that came with the initial release showed a lot of the potential in the engine they have created, but fell flat when it came to delivering a decent game experience.  Technical issues like not being able to save your game except at the end of "chapters" and overall lack of polish and development really made it feel like a module more than a completed game.  Which, to be fair, it technically was exactly that, and the campaign creation software is included in the game.  But personally I'd rather have a polished, complete feeling game than a toolkit.\nThe release of the Dragonfall campaign delivered everything that was missing; a real, fully fleshed out game with a well written and detailed story.  After a rocky start it feels good to wholeheartedly recommend Shadowrun, especially in a time when this particular genre has fallen by the wayside.\nFrom what I can tell after playing through the "Director's Cut", it includes improvements to the combat UI, more control over how your NPC buddies level up, adds more equipment, and a few missions which develop a few NPC characters further.

I'm also not much of a fan of turn-based combat but there is plenty of variety to kill your enemies with lots of guns and spells to use if you invest your karma points wisely (There is a fairly robust skill tree and you'll have to think hard about where to spend your points as there is a limited amount of them).\nThe matrix is basically just turn-based combat in virtual reality and since there are a lot less enemies and ways to deal with them this is the weakest aspect of the gameplay.\n\nVisually the game is pleasing with a nice variety of environments to explore and plenty of little details strewn around, combat also looks satisfying with occasional dismemberment when you kill an enemy along with special effects when you use spells.

While the entire "indie" industry has shown games this for a while, this game in particular stands out as a paragon of this message.\n\nThe Story:\nThe story arc that is set out for the character to play through is ingeniously and meticulously designed to capture the essense of a universe that is so wide in scope and details that packaging it into a small game makes the game more obviously golden. At no point in the game should you feel like you need to go buy a sourcebook for the tabletop RPG Shadowrun (from which this game is based) in order to understand what is going on. Further, despite not needing to, I found myself digging through articles online to digest the rich history behind various events that you "run" through. You are effortlessly immeresed into what "running the shadows" is like. From the perspective of someone who has played other tabletop RPGs, I can tell you that this game is one of two games I have ever played that does a system designed to be played on tabletop does justice to said game.\nThe story isn't one dimensional. Every character or class you play draws out anther element of the game. Even simply thinking about elements of various "runs" you perform, you discover the web of conspiracies and lies that line the seams of the Shadowrun universe. BUT! again, you don't have to do these things or spend time philosophising to enjoy the game. The main story by itself is terrific. For fear of spoilers, I will move on.\n\nThe Characters:\nThis is an aspect of games that I feel so few games do even remotely well. Even developers like Bethesda--for all the impressive things they spit out--have never made a game where I remember a single character's name for all the time I put into them and interacting with them. I understand many peoples' tastes on this matter in particular will vary. I feel that one thing that is most likely to make a game re-playable for me is remarkable characters. I will not get into the various characters in the game for fear of spoilers, but as bad with names as I am, I could probably name off all the main characters that you run with in the game. I get this deep feeling that despite the text medium with no voice over that I *know* these characters--that I have had conversations with them. *THAT,* from where I stand, is an incredible feat. The characters have various personalities and avoid "cardboard" stereotypes. They feel fleshed out as opposed to the long list of games I could rattle off with characters so hollow, you could cook a meal in the middle of a flash fire warning zone without the slightest fear of setting fire to the forest you were in.\n\nStyle / System:\nThis game is a top-down / isometric rpg design. When I saw screenshots of this, I decided to wait--I wasn't familiar enough with the Shadowrun tabletop game at the time to be a backer and I found that I rarely enjoyed isometric games. That fear was unfounded. When I began playing, the first comparison in my mind was the only other top-down game I had really enjoyed: Fallout (1). I don't enjoy that style, but this game streamlined it down (further in the director's cut) to a place where the story and the characters could shine. A bad system can overshadow and ruin the best of stories. Hairbrained took a style that I didn't enjoy and made a game that I both enjoyed and could easily put on my top 10 favorite games list. Are there things that could still be streamlined? Yeah--that's a loaded question though, because if you're honest, there aren't very many games that couldn't be streamlined. In this case, there might be one or MAYBE two things that could be streamlined more, but Hairbrained found a magical balance where this simple style allowed them to draw out elements of the universe that--for example--a first person shooter could have NEVER ever done.\n\n\nIf you enjoy RPG games for the story or for the characters, I have very little doubt that you would enjoy this game. Of course there's always the possiblility, but I find it unlikely at best.\n\nStop reading this and go run the shadows, already.","September 29, 2014","true","21.9"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

In a dystopian future, where dormant elf, orc and troll genes reemerged in the population and immortal dragons run mega-corporations that control the world, you join a crew of mercenaries known as Shadowrunners out of the Anarchy Flux-State of Berlin while attempting to survive a conspiration surrounding the possible return of Feuerschwinge, the most deadly of dragons.\n\nPros: This is a much improved standalone version of the Dragonfall DLC for Shadowrun Returns. The story and setting is just as compelling as the original, but with almost twice as many quests, including character-specific side-quests for each of your crew members, more creatures to fight, and additional equipment and cyberware. Now, as your crew levels up, you can direct the path they chose which will impact their equipment, as well as their skills, spells or special attributes. More than ever, choices matter as every dialog will have a variety of options, some only available with certain skills, which can dramatically change the end game with multiple very different endings. The music is just as immersive as it was before.\n\nCons: As with Shadowrun Returns, the graphics aren't on par with the AAA industry, mostly sprites and objects, and the game requires you to read to remain interested as there is no voice acting. The original game was created as a tool for the modding community, but that hasn't carried over as much with this standalone expansion as the Steam Workshop has little additional content. The tactical combat still lacks the dynamic environment found in other games of the genre.\n\nVerdict: ★★★★☆ - Next on your list!\n\nThis still comes off as highly recommended. But beware: if you buy this, you buy it for the incredibly well-written story, not for the tactical combat (although it isn't without its charm). If you like cyberpunk and fantasy, you will enjoy Shadowrun Dragonfall - Director`s Cut!\n\n—————————————————————————\nThis was just my opinion.\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated) reviews.","August 18, 2015","true","26.9"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

Coming into the game, I was just expecting a solid turn-based RPG in a unique cyberpunk/fantasy setting. It certainly delivers there, but all the care and thought put into the details elevates it into a great game I would recommend to all RPG fans, not just those that clap gleefully at the idea of troll mercenaries sniping corporate mages.\n\nOne of the primary elements that sets Dragonfall apart is how well it embraces player choice. The levels are carefully designed so that whatever your character's specialty, (s)he'll have a time to shine. Maybe you can hack some turrets to fire on the security guards, or maybe you're a smooth enough talker to convince them to let you in. If you've got a drone with you, there might be a vent you can send it through to explore. Some levels will feature ley lines which empower your mages' spells or maybe there's a restless spirit just waiting for your shaman to bind him.\n\nThese aren't just one-off examples, every mission has this kind of care put into it, letting your character do whatever awesome thing he or she can do.\n\nCombat is similarly diverse, with different skill sets gaining access to different spells and weaponry, each with their own benefits and shortcomings. You run a missions with your character and three additional characters of your choosing. While the game doesn't force you to do so, I would highly recommend switching up your party makeup some, as seeing different abilities and developing strategies around them is one of the fun aspects of the game. Tragically, only a subset of the available characters have in-mission dialogue lines. They're just a few flavor bits here and there, but I still resented missing out on them whenever I took a mercenary instead.\n\nThe second huge success of Dragonfall is the story. I was expecting the writing to mostly revel in smashing cyberpunk and fantasy tropes together, but it goes well beyond that, forging the disparate elements into an engaging mystery and quest. Of particular note are some of the moral choices your character can make, where conflicting agendas and imprecise information will leave you wondering what the "right" choice was even after you've seen the consequences. Thematically, the story definitely leans a bit more towards cyberpunk, with elements of class disparity and technological progress outpacing morality.\n\nI would be remiss to not mention that this game was developed on a budget much smaller than most modern RPGs, and it shows. There's no voice acting, no cinematics. The character models, while solid enough to not break immersion, look low poly/low texture resolution if you stop and focus on them. VFX and animation are similarly limited; most spells don't end up looking as awesome as you would expect. These shortcomings never took me out of the experience, but it did feel like the game relied more on my imagination to fill in gaps than most modern games.\n\nProvided you can get past the lack of AAA gloss, I would recommend this game to anyone who loves RPGs. It's got best-in-class diversity of characters paired with excellent level design and a great story with some of the best moral choices I've seen in games.","November 27, 2014","true","25.2"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

Just about everything in it is much improved upon and makes for a more enjoyable experience.  The UI in combat is easier to navigate; the story is deeper and better written; characters are fleshed out; more missions to do and people to talk to.\n\nEven though it was enjoyable, there still isn't enough here for me to want to play through it again.  There are plenty of other dialogue options I could go back and see, new builds to try, but the story and missions are too limited to make it worth it to me.  Had there been more optional missions, or randomly generated missions that kept the game fresh, I would consider it.  The framework of this game is ripped straight out of any BioWare game from the last 10 years.  You have a hub with some NPCs, your crew that slowly reveals more about themselves after each mission; you hit a point of no return, and the game wraps up.\n\nThat is probably the weakest part of the game.  It needs more things to do, missions to go on, items to use, equipment.  There is a really solid base here and with some more time to flesh things out, I think they could have a much better result.  Shadowrun is based on a pen and paper RPG like Dungeons & Dragons, it's biggest strength is how deep the gameplay and player choices go, and that's more what the devs should be aiming for.\n\nStill, this was a nice adventure, limited as it was, so I will recommend it. If anyone is looking to try Shadowrun, start with this, not Returns.","October 8, 2015","true","30.2"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Director's Cut goes above and beyond what the original Dragonfall did. For one, a completely revamped combat system. It made the game both easier and harder. Harder because if you're out of cover or something, you will be mince meat. The same can be said about your opponents, and some AI have a tendency to sit in the open. Another point is that there are some new missions. They shed light on your fellow runners. Storyline is amazing in my opinion. There are moral greys as well as black and white, but the game doesn't really beat you over the head with what's the right choice at the time, more what may or may not be reasonable. The characters are great, your followers and the Kreuzbasar's residence all have life to them, you get to see them change as the story goes on, both subtly and in ways that you can affect. I really have no gripes, just future ideas for future games, which is what that would turn the review into.

Biggest pros are the multi-dimensional characters, the correct pace of the main story and the atmospheric writing which makes it hard not to take just another mission or spend just one more hour in-game. You feel the price of your decisions more often than not, and that's a cool thing to give weight to these situations.\n\nAnother big pro is the studio behind the game - HBS - itself. Making Dragonfall - Director's Cut available to all DLC purchasers and backers for free wasn't something I'd have expected (not a common attitude nowadays when even a skinpack of two new textures or 'upgrades' between versions with almost no differences have their pricetags) and it speaks volumes about how the guys in HBS intends to handle their relationship towards their players. That builds trust towards both them and the games they create for me.\n\nCons are nuisances. Since you have an own team with rich backstory and personality, you barely need to hire random runners so that part seems a bit neglected. Custom builds for street samurai is still a weak point due to the over-simplied essence and cyber/bioware slot system. The engine has its flaws, but not to the point it would ruin atmosphere.  Voice-acting could have served great (still, I never felt they used up their limited budget unwisely).\n\nDragonfall is a great deal for anyone who likes futuristic fantasy/cyperpunk hybrids set in Europe for a change and don't get intimidated by a rich, written narrative (yes, you need to read a lot).","November 8, 2014","true","43.5"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

I was very pleasantly surprised with the game after starting it up.\n\nShadowrun: Dragonfall is a standalone expansion to Shadowrun Returns.  It's a tactical RPG with a deep and engrossing cyberpunk story that offers a lot of choice to the player.  The conversation and interaction system in place I found to be one of the most entertaining aspects of the game.  No matter what skills you choose to build you'll have options available to you that change one or more aspects of your current encounter and/or mission.  For example, someone with high decking would be able to hack into a facility's security system while someone with high strength would be able to just break down a wall.\n\nThe leveling system itself is well done.  There are your main stats (strength, quickness, intelligence, etc.) which each have a tree of their own to build on.  Strength, for example, has specialization branches for melee weapons, unarmed combat, and throwing weapons.  For your main character you choose where each individual point (called Karma in-game) goes, while for your allies you're given the option of choosing between two upgrades, similar to XCOM: Enemy Unknown.\n\nThe turn-based combat, in my opinion, is something of XCOM-Lite, though it is very fun and enjoyable all the same.  The story and RPG elements are deep, however, and that's where this game truly shines and makes its mark on the genre.\n\nI highly recommend this game to all fans of cyberpunk, tactical RPGs, and deep storytelling.","January 4, 2015","true","29.8"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

As for the audio, they could not have made anything better then what they offered. The character creation is pretty straightforward.\n\nAs this was their first attempt at Shadowrun, there are a few improvements they could bring forth in the future: a rotational camera (unless I missed that), perhaps an option to make the enemy characters "redder", as well as better character creation and ingame enemies (often times, the avatars do not like like the characters. Also, the way you create your character is limited). Lastly, I wish that options ingame truly had an impact - your dialogue choices make practically no difference, except in a few instances where the outcomes isn't all that different anyhow.\n\nDespite its flaws, the game developers gave it their all as they offered us a game with utmost professionalism.

The story is simply amazing, the side missions are intense, each character involved have unique backstory, and there are a lot of moments where morals and desires coming clashing together. The new interface makes life a little easier, the home hub is busy with things to do, there are a lot more uses of particular karma skills in dialogue than in the previous game, and each teammate have unique upgrades when leveling up. A drek-ton of twists and turns makes you want to know and see more. If you like conspiracies, corporate espionage, sabotage, assassinations, spiritual underworlds, gang turf wars, illegal experiments, magically attuned tech junkies, murders, mysteries, betrayals, and of course, a damn good story - should definitely give this a go.","September 20, 2014","true","29.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Graphics and art style are really well-made, with vibrant colors even for a game that takes place in the "shadows". The soundtrack is a pleasure to ears 100% of the time. Story and character development are trully engaging. One of the few games that actually manages to make you care for your team outside combat situations. Also one of the few games that makes you NOT mash on the <next> button of a dialogue, since it has no voice acting and feels like a session of pen and paper goodness. Leveling (karma) system is done right and also makes you feel that your character actually gets better not by just getting a +1 on his Level counter, but for gaining "actual" experience from the situations he faces. Combat mechanics are pretty decent as well. - could use a better aiming system though, since I missed plenty of times with 85%+ chance to hit and at one point I missed 3 times in a row with 99% chance to hit... Maybe it was the difficulty setting though, since I played the game at max difficulty level. Anyway, this isn't even an issue that downgrades your experience or one that would stop you from playing it. I highly recommend it if you love story driven, turn-based rpgs and a big plus is that you don't have to be a hardcore Shadowrun fan to enjoy the game","November 9, 2014","true","39.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

The story is well written and the dialogues are interesting while being limited (pretty much always branch out to the same final choice).\n\nGameplay (6/10): As you may have read in other reviews, the combat in this game plays a bit like X-Com: EU but with less strategic elements. I was expecting a challenging AI with challenging combat, both of which I didn't get. You can do pretty much whatever you want and win easily each time.\n\nReplayability (4/10): I can't see any reason to play through the game a second time. The story is too linear and the roleplaying elements aren't  implemented well enough so that you want to experiment the game with another type of character.  Also, I would have prefered a lot more items (secret weapons, secret armors, etc).\n\nGraphics (7/10): The graphics in this game are pretty (considering it's an isometric RPG  indie game). The environments are well detailed. The biggest letdown for me is that you can't rotate the camera like in XCOM:EU. Also, I noticed stuterring while the character moves and you move the camera at the same time.\n\nOverall (7/10) : I must admit that I had high expectations for S:D. I bought it because of the reviews on steam, where most people seemed to have really enjoyed the game. I would say that if you want a good story and don't mind for a very linear game with limited loot, you might enjoy the game. Stay away if you expect a RPG with lots of choices and consequences and want freedom of exploration like in Fallout 1/2 or Planescape:Torment.\n\nIn short\n\nGood:\n- Story\n- Setting and ambiance\n- Music\n\nBad :\n- Very linear (can be good if you like very linear games)\n- Combat not challenging enough (poor AI)\n- Too short\n- Not enough items to be discovered\n- Not enough RPG elements\n- No replayability ( for the single player of S:D only)","December 28, 2014","false","9.2"," 64 of 120 people (53%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","53","64","120","6","4"

The difference is not so much in the game engine, although some minor user-friendly UI tweaks in the Director's Cut are most welcome, as in the design of the content. Where the Shadowrun Returns adventure (The Dead Man's Switch) was heavy-handedly linear, almost completely lacking in opportunities to simply explore the landscape and run missions unrelated to the main plot, Dragonfall has some minor characters with interests and concerns (and missions) that have little or nothing to do with the fall of a dragon. It's almost like a rebirth of the brilliant world of the Sega Genesis entry in the Shadowrun video game franchise.\n\nMy one complaint is that it is most unsatisfying to try to play a Decker, which is my favourite class. Few missions require decking skills, and even when they are of use it is often simply a question of: "Do you have a party member with a Decker of at least level whatever?" If so, you can use this terminal, bypass this security, etc. ... without having to actually *do* anything.\n\nThat aside, I like this game a LOT. If you like to sandbox and take a leisurely look around, you can do that (some). If you want to stick to the main story and get to the end as quickly as possible, you can do that (mostly). And if you're a crusty old pedant like me, you'll be pleased to know that when the big story segments are presented, this time around the story is told with proper attention to spelling, grammar and punctuation.","September 30, 2014","true","426.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Not for gamers with ADHD.\nThis is a great game that hearkens back to the old-styled western RPG. The sort of game you would have played to death in the mid-nineties. But with much better graphics. The plot is full of character and soul, moreso than most games you see on the market as AAA titles.\n\nIt takes patience. Yes. There are main two elements: tactical turn-based combat and text driven story. Combat is not fast, nor is it encouraged. You gain XP by revealing the plotline, and not by killing.\n\nWhen solving puzzles you'll sometimes need a pen and paper to one side to (e.g.) jot down names or codes from a journal entry; as you may need that information to hack into a network later on.\n\nShadowrun Returns: Dragonfall is a love song to an older generation of gamers. It will appeal to people that want to read, and engage in, a story more than they want flashy graphics every time they open a door.\n\nHowever. Don't play this in a hurry, or if your comprehension of written English is below par. Reading is central to the experience here.\n\nIf you like isometric RPGs, the X-COM genre and Cyberpunk you'll love this. If you don't, or you have ADHD then you won't.","October 10, 2014","true","45.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Great story, interesting characters and a fun combat system. Dialogue that varies depending on how you build your character that can alter different missions and change the outcome in multiple ways. Tons of weapons and spells that make combat fun and engaging. I also have a bias towards cyberpunk settings. If you love cRPGS and like turn based combat this is a game you may want to check out.\n\nThe Bad:\n\nThis also happens to be one of the most unstable games on Steam that I have ever played. Glitches, game will crash, save files will fail to load, hang-ups for a minute before you can play. Near the end, one mission makes it impossible to save or else you will corrupt the save file... These are not isolated instances, many others seem to be having the exact same problems and what worse the developer don't seem to big in a hurry to fix any of this.\n\n\nConclusion:\n\nI could easily not recommend this game as many other have but the game itself is fantastic, of course, your enjoyment of the game depends on how much frustration you are willing to put up with. I say if you are a fan of the genre, jump in and enjoy the ride, everybody else should avoid this game until it becomes more stable.\n","February 25","true","40.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/berserk-smurf/recommended/300550/","berserk-smurf","Berserk Smurf","http://steamcommunity.com/id/berserk-smurf/","199 products in account","Isometric RPG in a weird German cyberpunk setting with decent turn-based combat, good implementation of the ruleset and an enjoyable storyline. You don't need to know the other games or the setting to enjoy this, but you do need to be prepared to read a bit.\n\nSolid 7.5-8/10 - the only real failing of this game is when you hit bugs, and you probably will at some point, so be warned.\n\nThere are ample reviews of this game already, I'll include a few things I haven't seen mentioned much in the other ones.\n\n\nWriting:\n\nCyberpunk setting, but don't you let that put you off - I'm not a fan of cyberpunk stuff, but the story holds my interest and the game is enjoyable anyway. Accessible, interesting and worth enjoying as a story in its own right.\n\nThe writing is passable if not stunningly good, there is a fairly dry narrative style throughout but it is concise enough not to matter, and the actual story told is great. Story arcs are sane in structure, characters are ok, motivation is created to continue and there is nothing infuriating for the story junkie, assuming you can cope with the natural level of cheesiness you get in this kind of setting.\n\n\nRP:\n\nDialogue *often* presupposes what the Player-Character's disposition will be towards a given NPC or event, offering a choice of different spins on the same thing that are obviously calculated to get different responses from the NPCs. As such, you won't be weaving a deep RP experience with your own character, picking to do the right or wrong thing, to love or hate this faction or that, throughout this game.\n\nSo in terms of RP, slightly more of an adventure than an RPG - but really good enough to play anyway, and you do get to build your own char properly in the mechanical sense.\n\n\nCombat:\n\nTurn-based not pause and play, but isometric RPG combat is here and well-implemented, with various classes that cast/melee/use guns, positioning is important (flanking, cover, proximity) and you can cast your party members in different roles and get a "game plan" going on that leverages their strengths.\n\nThere is a whiff of both XCOM and the infinity engine games about the combat, and although I can't promise you will enjoy Dragonfall's gameplay as much as either of those, it is fairly solid and holds up well if you are an old hand.\n\n\nProduction values/aesthetics:\n\nThe game is simple and perhaps inexpensive in art style and graphics, but is done in a way that looks and feels complete and consistent, neat and tidy - it will not make your eyes bleed. You may occasionally wince at the cheesiness of drawn/painted things, which have a whiff of fan art about them (the title screen being a great example) but I think this actually fits the cyberpunk aesthetic really well.\n\nSound is OK to good, with a nice 80s sci fi feel to the music which is again quite in keeping with the game's setting and tone - but again will not rock your socks off or anything.\n\n\nImplementation of ruleset:\n\nNot an expert on this ruleset, but at face value this seems to be a satisfactory implementation in spirit, indeed quite good considering how light the game seems at first. You can build a character as you wish using one of the predefined classes, or create your own from scratch, and everything that should be there for the purposes of gameplay, seems to be there.\n\n\nTouch controls (for the very few people who are interested :) ):\n\nObviously, mainly you will want to play this on a PC. With that said, should you switch to your Surface/other windows tablet for a relaxing session away from your PC, the game switches to touch controls and works excellently, which is a nice aspect of many top-down RPGS.\n\nIt could do with a toggle for touch controls rather than detection, however, because streaming to a tablet (which is otherwise awesome) means no touch controls - as a mouse-driven game you have almost everything working fine except mouse drag clicks somewhere random when you stop dragging (which makes combat very difficult/unplayable). That said, isometric RPGers who do this probably already own Gestureworks - I uploaded a profile for Shadowrun: Dragonfall which just adds a pad for mouse drag, so if you grab that the game is *mostly* fine. For hover, I guess you can switch the game to "double click" in the settings, although I didn't really find this necessary.\n\n\nBugs:\n\nThis is the only real downfall of the game. There are bugs, you can trigger them easily, you will find them. It's not such a nightmarish bugfest that I would give it a thumbs down, but it feels pretty bad to experience problems during a long and difficult fight (you can't save during combat) and patches don't seem to be forthcoming - the game can be something of a nightmare if you get caught up in the worst of these bugs, so be warned.","November 11, 2015","true","11.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brigand231/recommended/300550/","Brigand231","Brigand231","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brigand231/","135 products in account","I've been asked by many friends what the difference is between the Shadowrun Returns DLC for Dragonfall and the Director's Cut.  I'm going to write from that perspective; there's already plenty of reviews telling about the game itself and I will be using spoilers.  Let the reader beware.\n\nFirst off, the overall plot reminded me a  lot of Baldur's Gate II.  Divine being-type entity split from its divinity and that problem becomes the player's problem, the player is required to raise a ridiculous amount of money to chase their adversary, along the way the player gets to know their companions better if they care to, and the player is offered side missions for each of their companions that gives each of them a slight boost.  Despite all the similarities, I very much enjoyed the Shadowrun take on the story idea; enough to play it through several times and grab every achievement - as there are many "hidden" achievements tied to how the game ends, that's saying something.\n\nWhere the Director's Cut differs from the DLC is mostly the inclusion of the companion missions, the Black Lodge audition, and missions on behalf of some of the Kreusbazar vendors [the majority of these are in both games, but I know the mission for Ezkibel was missing from the DLC for sure].  There are some other noticeable, but minor differences like less dialog options when dealing with Doctor Ezkibel after taking care of the sewers, but they do not really impact the game at all.\n\nEdit:  playing the DLC after the Director's Cut allowed me to notice that for some reason there are some dialog triggers and conversations that somehow failed to fire in the Director's Cut.  For example, meeting Audran for the first time in the Director's Cut he just starts shooting when you meet him.  Playing the DLC, he actually explained why the player's intrusion could not be forgiven and finally some companion lines made more sense as they reference that later.\n\nI found that the missions and dialog included in the Director's Cut greatly enhanced the story and gave it a lot of depth that the player wouldn't know was missing until they experienced it as the DLC is not incomplete without it - it's just more complete with it.\n\nThe display and inteface is also slightly different between Dragonfall Director's Cut and the base Shadowrun Returns.  While both games made use of keyboard shortcuts for things like inventory items, spells, and personal skills only in Dragonfall are they labeled on the display - playing the base game I never even knew those shortcuts existed and they enable the player to enjoy a quicker and smoother combat experience.\n\nI also like how the weapon display was laid out in Dragonfall over the base game with all the information made available at a glance and number hot keys to switch to specific weapons.  The only thing I would consider missing from Dragonfall that was present in the base game was the "F" key to cycle through weapons when my attention was too focused on the scene to look up what number would correspond to whatever weapon, especially for a character whose loadout changes or an unfamiliar character.\n\nAnother item that is an improvement in Dragonfall in my opinion is the ability to lend not just consumable items to your team, but also weapons.  In my first playthrough, for example, I made use of rifles and shotguns so whenever I could afford to upgrade my own gear I was able to lend my previous weapons to Eiger as they were better than her in built gear for a while.

So if you enjoy the tabletop RPG, i would imagine you would love this game; If you hate Shadowrun or tabletop RPGs in general, you might not like this game.\n\nthe combat feels very similar to Xcom, as you control a team of generally 4 characters, each with their own particular skills and abilities, and all the characters have a limited number of action points they use to perform actions. although honestly I think I find Shadowrun's combat a bit more satisfying than Xcom, both do to an increased level of variety of skills and customization, and because of the roleplaying elements inherint in the gameplay.\n\nI get the feeling this won't be a game for everyone. If you need the shiniest graphics, or lack the patience to read pages of text (there is a lot of talking and exposition in this game and no voiceacting), or you simply don't care about story and just want to get into combat, then you might want to skip this game. But if you don't mind that, and are a fan of story based RPGs, then you will probably enjoy it.\n\nOne bonus to the poor graphics and lack of voice acting, I'm willing to bet that means mods are a lot easier to seamlessly make into the game, and I look forward to the mods and campaigns that the community creates\n\n\n\nOverall, 8.5/10. If you enjoy RPGs or tabletop RPGs you will likely enjoy this game.","September 24, 2014","true","83.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Now a disclaimer here: I was playing in OSX on a laptop, so the three minute loading times and stuttering are probably not as likely in windows, but they were there for me.\n\nNow what is it that makes this game good you ask? Well for one the writing takes the cake, and there are a lot of interesting characters with history to explore and many of them aren't completely static in terms of character developement. You get to know them and directors cut added a few missions which completely sates your desire for closure.\n\nAs you learn about the plot and setting the game leaves you wanting to know more, and there are a lot of places to read between the lines for the story. It plays out a lot like a book,  and you'll find your self reloading your game to explore different conversation options just to learn what might happen if...\n\nAs far as gameplay mechanics go it was a lot of fun, not too difficult but still offered a bit of variety. But it's not all roses, there was a pretty bad experience I had where I was pursuing my dream of being a rigger/summoner hybrid, which turned out to be a complete waste as you can't summon spirits when you have a drone. Big downer, as some combinations of skills are arbitrarily useless together. This is probably the biggest flaw of all, and was a bit turn off for me. In addition to this there are character builds where you can have up to 15 strength with trolls and whatnot. Well I'm sorry, but you are never going to get your strength that high because there just isn't enough karma that the game provides to justify it, and that was another disappointment. Throwing weapons are useless only because there are only two (yes, only two) throwing weapons in the game which is not at all apparent or even reasonable considering how many types of other weapons there are- Which also foiled my plan of having a character who only had strength and throwing weapons like a badass ninja.\n\nDid I mention the game is glitchy? Bugs with enemies not moving or attacking at all, the screen staying black after talking to shopkeepers, sluggish performance in OSX, lack of control options for key rebinding, three minute loading times, often clicking on things or loading menues took on average 5-10 seconds to perform... It didn't stop me from completing the game, but it'll probably stop me from replaying it. A sad thing to have to admit, as I really wanted to explore the mechanics more.\n\nAll things considered, I would still recommend this game. Good stories seem dead in the water in many mainstream titles, and you would do your self well to play through this at least once so long as you can digest some text and get lost in the world. The variety of endings really ticked my fancy, and there is plenty of good stuff to keep you interested in playing this title all the way through. At the price point of 15$ it really is a great deal for something that'll kick your imagination in to gear and deliver a satisfying story that you aren't likely to forget.","September 25, 2014","true","25.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Characters feel real, like they've been lived in for a while, not just plopped all one-dimensional and tabula rasa into the story. They have motivations, interesting origins, disagreements, and so on. They feel like actual people. And those people breathe life into the story -- a conspiracy yarn full of magic, intrigue, and high-tech low-lives. Choices are difficult. There's often a clear division between the morally right and wrong choices, but the consequences muddy it up. Is it better to spare some schlub for the sake of conscience if missing a payday means you can't stop far greater evil down the line?\n\nCombat is kind of a stripped-down X-Com affair with turnbased isometric squad stuff.

So if you enjoy the tabletop RPG, i would imagine you would love this game; If you hate Shadowrun or tabletop RPGs in general, you might not like this game.\n\nthe combat feels very similar to Xcom, as you control a team of generally 4 characters, each with their own particular skills and abilities, and all the characters have a limited number of action points they use to perform actions. although honestly I think I find Shadowrun's combat a bit more satisfying than Xcom, both do to an increased level of variety of skills and customization, and because of the roleplaying elements inherint in the gameplay.\n\nI get the feeling this won't be a game for everyone. If you need the shiniest graphics, or lack the patience to read pages of text (there is a lot of talking and exposition in this game and no voiceacting), or you simply don't care about story and just want to get into combat, then you might want to skip this game. But if you don't mind that, and are a fan of story based RPGs, then you will probably enjoy it.\n\nOne bonus to the poor graphics and lack of voice acting, I'm willing to bet that means mods are a lot easier to seamlessly make into the game, and I look forward to the mods and campaigns that the community creates\n\n\n\nOverall, 8.5/10. If you enjoy RPGs or tabletop RPGs you will likely enjoy this game.","September 24, 2014","true","83.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Now a disclaimer here: I was playing in OSX on a laptop, so the three minute loading times and stuttering are probably not as likely in windows, but they were there for me.\n\nNow what is it that makes this game good you ask? Well for one the writing takes the cake, and there are a lot of interesting characters with history to explore and many of them aren't completely static in terms of character developement. You get to know them and directors cut added a few missions which completely sates your desire for closure.\n\nAs you learn about the plot and setting the game leaves you wanting to know more, and there are a lot of places to read between the lines for the story. It plays out a lot like a book,  and you'll find your self reloading your game to explore different conversation options just to learn what might happen if...\n\nAs far as gameplay mechanics go it was a lot of fun, not too difficult but still offered a bit of variety. But it's not all roses, there was a pretty bad experience I had where I was pursuing my dream of being a rigger/summoner hybrid, which turned out to be a complete waste as you can't summon spirits when you have a drone. Big downer, as some combinations of skills are arbitrarily useless together. This is probably the biggest flaw of all, and was a bit turn off for me. In addition to this there are character builds where you can have up to 15 strength with trolls and whatnot. Well I'm sorry, but you are never going to get your strength that high because there just isn't enough karma that the game provides to justify it, and that was another disappointment. Throwing weapons are useless only because there are only two (yes, only two) throwing weapons in the game which is not at all apparent or even reasonable considering how many types of other weapons there are- Which also foiled my plan of having a character who only had strength and throwing weapons like a badass ninja.\n\nDid I mention the game is glitchy? Bugs with enemies not moving or attacking at all, the screen staying black after talking to shopkeepers, sluggish performance in OSX, lack of control options for key rebinding, three minute loading times, often clicking on things or loading menues took on average 5-10 seconds to perform... It didn't stop me from completing the game, but it'll probably stop me from replaying it. A sad thing to have to admit, as I really wanted to explore the mechanics more.\n\nAll things considered, I would still recommend this game. Good stories seem dead in the water in many mainstream titles, and you would do your self well to play through this at least once so long as you can digest some text and get lost in the world. The variety of endings really ticked my fancy, and there is plenty of good stuff to keep you interested in playing this title all the way through. At the price point of 15$ it really is a great deal for something that'll kick your imagination in to gear and deliver a satisfying story that you aren't likely to forget.","September 25, 2014","true","25.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

But the improvements for this standalone release make it by and large, far better then Returns. One is that you feel more connected with your team-mates and they level up as you do with a branching skill tree depending on how you want them to develop. And unlike Returns, I can actually remember my team-mates names. The hub mission system is also far funner to do then the straight line that Returns makes you run through. Not that you shouldn't play Shadowrun Returns if you've never played a game like this, it's a great introduction and makes understanding the mechanics for this game far easier. And they finally made your skills important for the game if you want to get into certain areas or not do too much combat. And the atmosphere is amazing as well, they really nailed the feeling of the Shadowrun universe.\n\nI also have to really put a little spotlight on the developer for upgrading everyone who got the DLC to also get the standalone game. It really want to support the company in their future releases if this is how they treat their customers. But seriously, this game is what I remember old expansion packs being, an entire second campaign with tons of new content to enjoy!","September 25, 2014","true","4.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

What do you get, when you call your mutant hellhound while subconsciously scratching right below the smartlink implant to steady the aim of your pistol, which shoots shotgun rounds, activating you spirit guide for a movement buff while your at it - to assist the female former special ops member in your party - who is also a troll? Hint. Asking the Dragonslayer shaman behind her wont get you much closer to the answer, but most likely make you chuckle at his response. He was the lead singer in a band once...\n\nIf you haven't deduced it yet - the setting is superb. The characters well written. The story meaningful and gripping.\n\nThe best fables use magic and archetyping as set up, not to self referentially glorify the ingenuity behind it and Shadowrun: Dragonfall is a tremendous fable in that vain. The time it takes the game to draw you into the world behind the shadows - is five minutes, and it wont let you out of its grasp anytime soon.\n\nGameplay wise it is a round based, tactical, strategy game with a limited set of party members - in the tradition of an XCOM game, but with the added benefit of character arcs and backstories you will care about. Its accessible even for genre beginners but at the same time incredibly rewarding to master at the later stages.\n\nThe developers were able to address most criticisms of the older Shadowrun Returns release. The UI was overhauled, saving is now possible at every stage of the game and gameplay systems improved.\n\nDragonfall is a 12-15 hours standalone game (derived from a former DLC within Shadowrun Returns) with a unique story and a fantastical setting, whose biggest problem was the lack of marketing money to launch it into a broader market. It got niche recognition and well deserved critical acclaim - but only a few people ever played it.

The story was way better, everything felt more polished and finished, and it scratched a Shadowrun wargaming  itch I've had ever since picking up the Shadowrun DMZ box set many years ago. I always had trouble persuading people to try out DMZ because it's a complicated setting with a lot of tactical possibilities and the rules involve quite a lot of random number generation and book-keeping, the kind of thing that's really more suited to some kind of mechanical calculator..\n\nAnyway, this is an updated version of Shadowrun Dragonfall with a much better engine, loads of cool new gear, NPCs and sidequests. You can finally choose how to upgrade your party and resolve their personal ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t side-missions. There's a new UI. The story and setting are still satisfyingly Shadowrun.\n\nOn the whole it was well worth the zero pounds sterling the upgrade cost me. If you also got it for free (seriously, you should check) then I would recommend playing it.

Actually it's because the RP base isn't as developed as in US or EU. Most of the knowledge of Shadowrun's universe came from watching Spoony Experiment videos on shadowrun. It sounded like fun and when Dragonfall popped up on sale — I took my bet into playing it. I'd say it's worth the money.\n\nThe idea, the look, the type of game play — it hooked me up, I like those type of games. The techno&magic mix made me go nostalgia about Arcanum... what a treat that was... I most likely will be comparing those two in the review quite a few times.\n\nAnyway, you play as a shadowrunner, a person doing jobs, or should I even say "shady" jobs, hoho, for the profits! Yeah, that's about it actually. Yes, you're just a "mercenary" going to do jobs to profit from. Killing, hacking, sabotaging, blowing sheit up — you name it. And you don't work alone, you got a bunch of fellow shadowrunners at your side helping you out. I assume that can go out solo by not picking any mates on the mission screen but the mechanics of the game don't have stealth elements in it, so you'll just end up eating a bullet in the end anyway.\n\nSo your first mission is to break into an old estate of some guy. Simple enough. You go in, rumble around and... sheits get real! Yeah, you don't fool around in here. Sheit gets real fast and you need to work your way through up till the end.\n\nNot going to spoil more so let's go more into technical stuff:\n\n1)The graphics are ok. I mean it looks like neverwinter in future (no surprise) so you shouldn't be expecting hotzors 3d female forms popping out on you and having blast process of your nvid cards blow your mind. You're not here for the graphics. Good games don't need graphics (they do actually, "cough").\n\n2)The skills and rp elements are where they are. You get a big tree of skills which helps your character to go through his hardships of shadowrunning. Be that gunfight, hacking, casting spells — it's all here for you. Want to be a ninja with a sword and a rifle - sure thing. A pro-hacking mage — not a problem. Want to be a dwarf that hits people in the shins — go right ahead, do it! There are a bunch of races to pick from: dwarfs, humans, elfs, trolls... I assume it just gives partial boost to stats and limits to your skill tree. Just pick an elf and you can be good at pretty much everything! You even get to choose the skills of your fellow group runners, but the choices are quite limited. Actually they are limited to just 2. Yeah, bummer.\n\n3)Action. Well, this where the game takes a moderate blow. Your acting on the field is pretty limited. You just walk around, point and click stuff to work/pick up and when enemies pop up you go into the attack mode which did disappoint me. The combat is turn based which provides each of the character with limited amount of action points. That is 2 for most of the game and 3 at the end of it. Those can be boost by certain items for a period of round, but it's not a big thing. It all falls down to finding the biggest rock/table/cover on the screen, get behind it and start shooting. Going out with your fists and swords is possible as well, which actually isn't such a bad choice, but I dismissed the idea of becoming  a bullet-cushion. To spice the combat a bit there where added a few things to mage it a tad more interesting, like leylines for the casters (specific points on the map which glow and add some bonuses to casting) and explosive barrels (which there aren't a whole lot throughout the game, but hey, I guess it would look even more rtarded if the goons where hanging around explosive materials. There can also be found some turrets which can be hacked to from certain terminals, but they aren't all that groundbreaking.\n\nThe hacking UI is pretty similar to the combat one, except that you're limited to specific "program" actions that you buy and the linear maps are even more linear. Not much to say about that, except that getting killed in the virtual land just makes your eyes bleed a little, not killing you on the spot (most of the times).\n\nControls aren't spectacular. Misclicking is sometimes a point of frustration, when it leads to cancel your attack action forcing your az out of cover up to your enemies face. For the weapon selected you have a bunch of skills to use (depending on how you level them) which consume different amount of action points and ammo. Yeah, while you have ammo, you don't have its count, as in - you don't need to buy it. It's stocked up so you just need to reload your gun when you need to, spending a point or two to do so. Mana for the casters doesn't seem to be running out as well. You just get counters on your skills and magic which usually takes about 1-2 rounds of cool down.\n\nThe first thing in combat I went to was my numpad. In Arcanum you could pick the part of the body to make your attack to but in here... no, you can't do that. It could've added possibilities though, as in — shoot the gun/arm of the foe and then talk some sense into him... but nope, murder that fker!\n\nThere's also no stealth element in here. No crouching, getting past people, etc. At a certain mission you'll try to go past a patrolling guard without detection, but most likely you'll fail a few times like me, crossing out stealth completely.\n\nWhile not on the missions you get to hang around a sector of town named Kreuzbasar. It got all ya need — weapons, hacking tools, medical supplies, magic, all natural coffee. I should note though, that the stocks are rather poor. There isn't much of variation on guns, spells or other tools. It's just a item with a level 1 at start and later items and spells of 2 and 3rd levels. You also get to have some robo and bio implants injected into your body, but there isn't a big variety of those as well and you'll need quite the coin to get jacked all over with those. Not to mention that they decrease your "humanity" points or w/e, which decreases the amount of spell-slots of yours.\n\n4)Socials. As an RP game about 30-40% of the game you'll be talking. Talking to people, machines, your dog, etc. Same to interactions with terminals and computers. You get certain lines of dialog each time which are fun to read and decide on whether you're a good guy, ok guy, not care a lot guy or an azhole. The responses will come out in the similar line to your dialog options. There are a few specific lines that pop up from time to time and if you have the required skills (charisma, decking, etc...) — you can pick those. They mostly just give additional options of solving your verbal problems together with giving some neat text to read and a few karma (skill) points.\n\n5)Characters. The game actually works a bit strange with that. You have a set of runners with you, ones that are close colleagues of yours and others hired for cash. But picking certain classes as your own to play, such as a caster or decker makes certain chars obsolete. You can only go in a set of 4 to runs but for some reason the absent member of your crew seem to have a dialog later of how difficult it was doing this or that, how good you where on a mission and stuff. Creepy. Or lazy? The socials in your crew aren't really gained, in the end you still can talk everyone up to their best and get their special missions. At certain point you it ruins the feel of completing stuff for them.\n\n6)Overall. The game is satisfying, but leaves a feel that it's raw. The potential of such game is huge, like that of Arcanum, but this one is shallow. I do though understand that this one is just a start for the setting. At some point I hope that it will stand up to Arcanum standards, will turn from an enthusiast based table game into an epic adventure. Right now it's a onetime game.","December 15, 2014","true","40.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I made a point of playing an aƨƨhole character, which I would never do by the way, interested whether or not the writing was baby-banging-to-the-wall bad. It was not! I enjoyed piƨƨing off the troll and being a bit of a diↄk to everyone in a loving, shadowrunnery sort of way. Even to a dragon. There is a dragon in it! Hope I didn't spoil it for you.\n\nBack to the game: combat starts weird but gets enjoyable later on as your options open up. I was playing a rigger/decker, and I will most probably play this game again as a mage. Inventory management is utter ƨhite, and while not being able to manage your story-companion character's gear, it is quite understandable from the context: they are all running the shadows. No way some dwarf in cool shades can just fancy-prancy-magic-dancy into their hole - err, home - and tell them what to wear and what to kill people with.\n\nMy biggest complaint would be the UI. I hope it got better in later titles, because not being able to manage inventory and seeing stats like HP on the same page is bad design. Also, the rotating between party members' inventories and character screens when trying to heal them outside of combat is just stupid too. It gets bearable once you get the logic of it, mind you there is little to it. Maybe there are mods for that? I have not checked, quite frankly.\n\nStory is good, interesting, lots of choices. It also taught me, as someone interested in game mastering shadowrun and other, a good lesson: always have mechanically different solutions to problems. As a rigger and decker, I had plenty opportunity to get around obstacles: make fights easier by turning automatic weaponry against their owners, hack matrix defences and get access to cameras thus avoiding conflict where unnecessary, as well as a lot of additional information during missions that would not have been available to me had I played a charismatic mage character. Though those can be deckers too! Though you pay with magical capabilities due to the essence loss associated with cyberware implants, but hey, make an interesting character, not one that is a cookie-cutter powerhouse. You are here to have fun, after all.\n\nDifficulty-wise, I played it on hard, had no issue. I would recommend playing on hard because if normal is any more easy, anyone who has played strategic games like this will be bored quick. Whenever I rewinded a mission, during which you cannot save so you have to start again, I did it to see different conversational choices' effects on the narrative. Some differed to greater degree than others.\n\nOverall, this is a good game. I do recommend it to folks, whether you like Shadowrun as a tabletop rpg, or not.","April 8","true","46.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It breathes cyberpunk.\n+ The sounds in it are very atmospheric, both environmental sounds and the great soundtrack.\n+ The gameplay itself is very solid, nice amount of depth. Basically XCOM:EU-lite.\n+ Nice pacing, no unnecessary filler. My first playthrough took me 30 hours, and not a second was I bored.\n\n- Team inventory is only accessible at the start of a mission, not during.\n- Some fights take too long, like "in X rounds Y will happen". I didn't like that.\n\n\n~ 2054, Berlin. Welcome to the Flux State. ~\nThe Good\nShadowrun: Dragonfall - a game that has been on my radar for a while, but due to circumstances I never really got around to that. I've recently decided to give it a try, and it only took half an hour for me to get hooked. After a short but intense tutorial, you find yourself in a beautifully designed, atmosphere and futuristic Berlin. At times it can feel overwhelming, especially if it's your first cRPG experience. Which is what it was for me. The world is absolutely packed with lore, and the best thing about it is they don't force feed it to you. It's only there for people who want to know about it, it's completely optional. A lot of those little pieces of information can be put together and it really helps make Berlin feel alive. It all contributes to the amazing experience of the main story. An excellent story filled with mystery and plot twists. I'm also very positive about the characters. Each one of them has different stories to them, and they're fully fleshed out that make all of them very memorable.\n\nAnother thing I really liked - or even liked the most - was the insane amount of player freedom. There are many situations that can be solved in more than one way, in a handful of ways, and frequently even more than that. You can be smooth and talk your way through (or into) trouble, or you can be as subtle as a brick to the teeth and let the bullets do the talking. Or, I don't know, smash a wall and make yourself an entrance if you're into that. Or are you the type of guy that likes to bribe people? Intimate them? Or use different skills to pass through? There's a lot you can do to solve encounters, and that amount of player freedom gets even better if you factor that most of the stuff you choose to reach your objectives have their own set of consequences.\n\nThe not so Good\nAre there any flaws? Well, actually there aren't. At least not in a way that really bothered me. However, there are two things I'd consider unfortunate, but not actually flaws themselves. But still. The biggest one (and probably even the only one) is that you can access your team mates' inventory during missions. It's only available at the start. After that it's not possible any more to change their inventory, only yours. Also, some fights can take a little while. Especially the ones with time pressure ("in X rounds Y will happen") felt like they could have ended sooner.\n\nAnd that's all she wrote. This is the first "traditional" cRPG I have played, and it has set the bar extremely high. Even for newcomers, it can maybe feel a little overwhelming at times, but stick with it like I do, and if you like narrative-heavy cyberpunk experiences, this will be right up your alley.","May 6","true","31.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

What was great about the original - beautiful 2D isometric artwork, modability, variety in character builds, good combat with some tactical depth, and an OK story - has been double downed on in Dragonfall.\n\nThe story's easily the most talked about strength of this game.  Where other games will rush to establish most of the characters you meet the moment you meet them (looking at you, Borderlands), Dragonfall takes its time to let characters develop over time.  There's plnety of opportunity to establish your own protagonist too throughout dialogue, which doesn't reward the nice guy choice every single time.  In a way, the game is sort of like what would happen if Telltale decided to ditch their amazing voice talent to do an isometric tactical RPG.\n\nCombat is notably stepped up.  While the original Shadowrun Returns had massive balance issues that made the game way too easy, in Dragonfall there's considerably more care put into crafting tense firefights.  Very Hard difficult is actually fairly difficult, with massive shootouts being hard enough to justify sometimes avoiding them by using your skills.\n\nCharacter building in particular is a lot more rewarding.  There's a lot of skill checks in the game that expand on the story or give you something extra or allow you to tackle a mission in a completely different way.  You could of course look up a guide to figure out the exact point totals you need to succeed every check, but the result is a spread out character that might have some trouble getting through the game.\n\nAnd, of course, there's plenty of beautiful artwork to go around.  Character portraits and backgrounds are as great as they were before, evoking the tropes of the cyberpunk setting.  The only complaint to be had is the low-poly character models.  The less you zoom in on them, the better.\n\nOnce you finish the main game, there's plenty of high quality user-made campaigns waiting for you.  There's plenty of junk, sure, but stuff like From the Shadows, Run are worthwhile in their own right.\n\nFor $6, it's a steal.  There's a version on Android for the same price right now, but from what I recall it lacks modidng support.  The game isn't exactly graphically intensive, so if you don't care much for user generated content or if Harebrained Schemes brings in modding support for it later, the mobile version should be just as good and way more portable.","December 28, 2014","true","12.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Where other games will rush to establish most of the characters you meet the moment you meet them (looking at you, Borderlands), Dragonfall takes its time to let characters develop over time.  There's plnety of opportunity to establish your own protagonist too throughout dialogue, which doesn't reward the nice guy choice every single time.  In a way, the game is sort of like what would happen if Telltale decided to ditch their amazing voice talent to do an isometric tactical RPG.\n\nCombat is notably stepped up.  While the original Shadowrun Returns had massive balance issues that made the game way too easy, in Dragonfall there's considerably more care put into crafting tense firefights.  Very Hard difficult is actually fairly difficult, with massive shootouts being hard enough to justify sometimes avoiding them by using your skills.\n\nCharacter building in particular is a lot more rewarding.  There's a lot of skill checks in the game that expand on the story or give you something extra or allow you to tackle a mission in a completely different way.  You could of course look up a guide to figure out the exact point totals you need to succeed every check, but the result is a spread out character that might have some trouble getting through the game.\n\nAnd, of course, there's plenty of beautiful artwork to go around.  Character portraits and backgrounds are as great as they were before, evoking the tropes of the cyberpunk setting.  The only complaint to be had is the low-poly character models.  The less you zoom in on them, the better.\n\nOnce you finish the main game, there's plenty of high quality user-made campaigns waiting for you.  There's plenty of junk, sure, but stuff like From the Shadows, Run are worthwhile in their own right.\n\nFor $6, it's a steal.  There's a version on Android for the same price right now, but from what I recall it lacks modidng support.  The game isn't exactly graphically intensive, so if you don't care much for user generated content or if Harebrained Schemes brings in modding support for it later, the mobile version should be just as good and way more portable.","December 28, 2014","true","12.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Now a standalone entry, Dragonfall is my recommended place to start for those interested in trying out Shadowrun.  It takes the solid infrastructure created for Shadowrun Returns and builds upon in expertly, with a new focus on growing a core group of characters as much as a single protagonist.  The gameplay retains its fun turn-based tactical combat, new equipment and spells add increased options, and an expanded matrix system makes hacking more relevant and rewarding than before.\n\nBut perhaps just as important in my estimation, it’s not just that is Dragonfall a good game, it’s good Shadowrun.  It successfully devotes itself to maintaining both the engrossing setting and the experience of running the shadows with a crew.  While playing I felt like I was playing through a fantastic module for the tabletop version.  It hits all the right notes: a colorful group of criminals and exiles, machinations of powerful corporate juggernauts, terrifying magical and technological advancements, and an ending that manages to feel both triumphant and bleak.\n\nWith its character-focused storyline and emphasis on leading and growing a team of Runners, Dragonfall is Shadowrun done right.","November 9, 2015","true","31.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Not only that, but there's actual characters with arcs, choices, and a plot that's more than 'a bad guy wants to do bad stuff because he's evil, go stop him.' Likewise, the setting and its unique aspects are actually interwoven and integral to the characters, events and choices in the game, rather than serving as a convenient backdrop for a bog-standard save-the-world story populated by stock characters and stereotypes, as in its predecessor.\n\nThe combat has a lot more depth, too.

Best I can do is analogise --\n\nDead Man's Switch is to Dragonfall .. as The Hobbit is to The Lord of the Rings.\n\nMeaning a lesser (but still fun) work that came before a much grander work.\n\nThe characters and situations in Dragonfall are just beautifully written.

Such is the case with Shadowrun: Dragonfall so let's waste no more time and just dig into it, chummers.\n\nDeveloper Harebrained Schemes has most certainly demonstrated to have learned a lot from Shadowrun Returns and applied it to this game; ranging from basic UI improvements which are this time not hampered by game's tablet release as well as various tweaks and plain structural changes in order to make it more of a traditional RPG as opposed to a highly linear affair. For starters, game actually has more-than-token hub area you'll keep coming back to for more than just recruiting characters because hey, while you CAN recruit some unrelated Fixers in good old Shadowrun tradition, game is obviously built with an already existing cast of characters and it behooves you to stick with them in order to get their input during missions as well solving their own sidequests and gaining approval in the process. Cast is varied, both personality and archetype-wise, so you'll definitely find staple characters befitting your character build.\n\nBut the most important change compared to the original is, as mentioned above, a purely structural one. Dragonfall is a grander game on pretty much every level. Ranging from more involved story to more missions as well as the real show stopper – healthy sprinkling of choices and consequences you'll get to handle throughout the game. They range from depending on your etiquette and minor ones to major decisions affecting the main story in drastic ways you may want to replay certain sections to fully witness. Definite step up.\n\nTo close up game is not perfect, but most of those issues are my own preferences. I'm a fan of low-key Shadowrun and Returns' story was more along those lines as opposed to affecting the state of the Flux-State to such a degree in Dragonfall and you could argue game loses some of its tight narrative by giving you missions you only do in order to get the funds you need to progress further, but I think those would largely be dishonest complaints to hold against the game in the end.","September 30, 2015","true","26.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","2"

Neither the first nor this one has really produced a gripping story. Combat options are limited. I HATE HATE HATE the hacking sequences. There are a lot of flaws in this series.\n\nYet I play these and have a great time with them. The exploration is good. The world of Shadowrun is so compelling that you just have to see what's around the next corner. The art style is simply one of my favorites in any game, ever.  The gameplay is cool - you will not have the skills to solve every issue and you have to learn how to deal with it. That might be maddening to some, but it makes it all the sweeter when you do have the right skills to take advantage of the situation.\n\nPlus, the dev is awesome. Not only do they release a good game at release, but they've gone in and added real content as a "thank you" to their customers. Who else really does this? Which is why I backed their latest kickstarter.\n\nThis won't be your GOTY, but you will get 20 hours or so of great enjoyment from it if you like the subject matter. Plus you're supporting one of the "good guys" in gaming development.\n\nNow that is all said, let's talk about Drgonfall. Shadowrun Dragonfall is the highlight of the series. With very similar gameplay mechanics between the three different games n this series it boils down to which game has the best and most comprehensive story. Dragonfall's story is - IMO - the most memorable of the bunch. It's interesting, it's complex and it's there are some very good NPC characters in this game world. It's not the most brilliantly written RPG but Dragonfall is above average (while the other two are fairly average). Combat options have been improved from the first game and the Director's Cut additions do a much-needed job of fleshing out the game world.\n\nThus I recommend this to RPG fans. If you're going to play all 3 Shadowrun games then I suggest you do so in order they were released. If you're going to buy just one, this is the one to buy.","March 24, 2015","true","27.3"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

If you've played Shadowrun Returns, and you felt there was this *one* thing that if they changed, it'd be better, or if only it had this little tweak, you'll love Shadowrun: Dragonfall.\n\nSeriously, that's the highlight of what makes this game great. Play through the first one, see the potential of the system and its shortcomings, and those are mostly gone here. While it still has room for improvement, I trust that the developers will iterate on an already repolished system with the upcoming China campaign.","January 7, 2015","true","39.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

So far the environment is pretty immersive and I don't generally get immersed. There are multiple ways to succeed in missions depending on character strengths and despite the basic classes you seem to be able to move across and create your own mix. I'd say worth a trip to the movies in price and maybe more depending on how high level combat works and how deep the story goes.","December 14, 2014","true","47.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But enjoying those games and enjoying this isometric old-school CRPG with turn based combat is *not* mutually exclusive.\n\nIn short: Combat oriented (but with lots of possibilities to avoid combat) tactical squad (4) and turned based combat CRPG with great depth, atmosphere, characters, lore, consequences, multiple paths to success, etc etc. Combat is similar to XCom: Enemy Unknown, but easier (without being easy at all). Building on "Shaduwrun: Returns", but with more personality, a fixed squad/team (but still the possiblity to "hire" "externals"), overhaulded combat interface, less bugs (but sill some bugs, nothing to worry about though), and more content (spent almost twice the amount of time on this one, though a fair share of that time was spent doubting how to build and balance my character using XP, cyber&bio-ware, weapons, drugs and armor).\n\nI also want to re-itterate that this game is text based (no voiced dialogs, no cut scenes,...) . At first, it's a little bit difficult to focus on, but after a while, I read every word. It's amazing what good written text can achieve. In AAA games heavy (in engine or not) cut scenes would be used which would require great effort to create and voice act (which don't always work out that well in the end, thinking about silly face expressions and sex scenes in Dragon Age 2 - for example), while a few paragraphs of text can and WILL achieve great engagement. Wonderful.\n\nFYI. Played on Hard. In Shadowrun Returns played Chi Casting and melee fighting female Orc. In Dragonfall - Directors Cut, played a Street Samurai (Elve, female once more): A riffle weapons specialist without any magic at all. This allows you not to worry about your character's essence (required for magic and quick spell cooldowns), which allows you in turn to go crazy with cyber&bio-ware. Focussed on Quickness and Dodge, as well on Charm and Etiquettes.\n\nFun fun fun.\n\n(*) Not that there is anything wrong with that ... :-)","December 15, 2014","true","44.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Dragonfall is a tactical rpg with different difficulty levels. Combat is relatively easy when approached with some common sense at least up to hard difficulty and you can't customize much outside your main character.\n\nWhat made me like this game? It's very descriptive with its dialogue. Normal conversations between characters are expressed with narrations and loading screens are used for expressing the situation further. Your party members each have a character arc that is rather intriguing, however, they don't last the whole game.\n\nShadowruns setting is interesting to me since it's cyberbunk meeting fantasy. Elves, dwarves, orcs and trolls running around using magic within futuristic Berlin alongside hackers and gunslingers. You can be something among these running around Kreuzbasar, one of the safe havens for unsavory types.\n\nKreuzbasar has certain charm to it. It's a slum full of different people whose dialogue is refreshed after each mission. It's used as a base of operations for our protagonist. I could delve more into characters but I think I'll leave that for you to find out.\n\nWho should I recommend this to? Well, people that like to immerse themselves into the settings and people that like western role-playing games in general, like Baldur's Gate.\n","December 29, 2014","true","31.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Smooth combat, lots of options, extremely flexible character creation model. Recommended, particularly for RPG and tactics gamers.\n\nThe Director's Cut of Shadowrun: Dragonfall is a lighthearted, fun, and extremely playable RPG.  While visual effects are a little on the sparse side (no between-act cinematics a la Diablo here!), the world nevertheless feels like a living thing, and it's a pleasure to explore. The game's writing does an excellent job of keeping a player engaged, and develops a very solid, likeable, and extremely replayable setting. Hacking ('decking'), close combat, guns, and magic all mix together into a variety of player strategies, providing a broad set of options to get past each mission's obstacles.\n\nThe gameplay feels smooth and solid, particularly with the Director's Cut revamp of the user interface. Everything is presented in an intuitive and easy-to-navigate manner, and the combat feels similar to other successes like XCOM, Fire Emblem, and other grid-based tactical games.\n\nThe real advantage of Shadowrun Returns, as always, is the potential for user-created content. Shadowrun Returns is more of a foundation than anything else--with a handy, built-in campaign to show what it's capable of. The original Shadowrun Returns had a handful of extremely popular user-created campaigns available in short order, and I have high hopes for the Director's Cut content to come from Shadowrun's fan base. With these, the possibilities are endless. Although I have high hopes for future campaigns coming out of Harebrained Schemes, I'm sure that the game's fanbase will provide more than enough content to keep me occupied for a long, long time.","October 5, 2014","true","1.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Each character has a unique personality. There are different dialogue options and approaches to each battle. There are unique classes and you can customize your character the way you want it. The hacking system is also very cool and unique compared to other games. The story itself is intriguing and will draw you in.\n\nOne of the things I like about this game a lot is the karma/skill system. Everytime you complete a mission or side mission you will get karma. Karma is used to upgrade your character's skills. There is a lot of customization for this and the race you choose will even impact this. You don't get anything for killing enemies in the game. This is a fresh way to go about it since I feel like some games reward the players too much. Complete the mission first to get the reward, not during the mission. It also means when reinforcements are coming you won't be inclined to want to kill them just for extra loot/xp.\n\nAll in all, I would give this game a 8.5/10.

This is something Harebrained tackled head-on with the Dragonfall DLC, later released as a stand-alone product. While it doesn't hold a candle to some of the behemoth open world CRPGs out there, there's a great deal more optional interaction to be discovered in Dragonfall versus the original Dead Man's Switch campaign.\n\nMore than the breadth of the world, Dragonfall really adds to its depth as well. The characters and dialog are uncommonly good. If you take the time to get to know the runners on your crew, you'll find a wealth of well-thought-out backstories doled out throughout the game in well-measured helpings. I would venture that this game performs well when viewed in the light of gender equality, as well. While the Sixth World can be an exploitive place, the game empowers you to do something about that. Dragonfall features a number of meaningful major roles for women, and their roles and backgrounds perform well against with-a-pink-bow and bechdel examinations. This game isn't making a statement about gender equality (because it's in no way "about" that), but I applaud it for executing its goals well while demonstrating that a quality title doesn't need to play into shallow tropes.\n\nI've been reading the Shadowrun core rulebook for the pen & paper game to get a group started with some friends, many of whom are newbies to P&P RPGs, let alone Shadowrun. I've recommended this game to get them familiar with the universe.

Shadowrun has truly returned and this game has done much to reinvigorate the fandom that's been dedicated to the setting for decades now.\n\nShadowrun comes with one campaign, Seattle and it's a lovely campaign. I loved the story and really loved the gameplay. The difficulty curve is difficult to gauge, but since so much of the challenge is in unraveling the story, it tends to vary from player to player. All in all, it's about an 8-12 hour campaign depending on your personal pacing and you'll love being immersed in the shadows of this particular fantasy.\n\nThe real glory of the game for me is the editor it comes with which allows players to create their own campaigns. It's very powerful and easy to learn. At the time of this writing there are already dozens of player content out there, a lot of which is great stuff. Because of the editor, there's a solid community of engaged players to interact with and really enjoy the game. This is a must buy for gamers who love story driven games and especially those who love the world of Shadowrun.","October 12, 2014","true","7.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I dare say, even better.\n\nYou see, nostalgia would have you say that Baldur's Gate is superior, but the truth is that like the cartoons we watched when young, the plots and characters aren't as good as our nostalgia-ridden memories would suggest. Shadowrun: Dragonfall raises the bar and gives us believeable characters and really interesting choices in the game. The ending can be VERY different depending on what your choices where during the game, putting triple A titles like Mass Effect to shame.\n\nBottom line, if you are into good storytelling, and even if you aren't familiar with the world of Shadowrun (I wasn't), you'll find Dragonfall to be a delightful game. It's the kind of game that makes you afraid of finishing it, because you know you'll miss it's characters and setting.\n\nThe game clocks at around 20+ hours and there's an editor included. Though it isn't as user friendly as - say - the NWN2 editor, there's some really talented (and patient) people out there producing UGC (User Generated Content) that can extend the life-time of this game for at least another 20 hours or more.\n\nThank you Harebrained Games for a great experience, hope to see more of you soon.\n\nPD: Did I mention these guys released the Director's Cut version FOR FREE to owners of the original version? FREE DLC? And it's not hats or some other stupid prop that nobody cares about but ACTUAL game content?

That much should be evident from the amount I've written here.\n\nWhile I don't wish to draw too strong a comparison between this and Shadowrun Returns (bearer of the infamously mediocre 'Dead Man's Switch' story), I believe it's worth mentioning that this particular installment of the franchise will, at the very least, pleasantly surprise both veterans of 'Returns' and those completely new to Shadowrun. In short, the system works, and while I'm sure they exist, I have yet to find any obvious game-breaking features that can either severely screw or enable the player. In all, while maybe not as brutally unforgiving as some players might wish, the gameplay is varied enough and detailed enough to provide both a challenge and entertainment.\n\nFor those not knowing what to expect, combat is a turn-based affair where the player's team slugs it out with various shady individuals, gang members, insane mages and fantastical creatures. Here you'll find lots of different guns, melee weapons, special attacks and spells, all of which can be helped along by shiny cyberware, drones, and various performance-enhancing drugs. It's pretty great, and the tactical options are relatively detailed. That said, you don't have to run 'n gun your way through every encounter. Don't expect to be able to use much stealth throughout the game, but a lot of fights can be circumnavigated with proper exploration, use of etiquette in negotiation, hacking various environmental features, or just plain picking the right dialogue options. After all, it IS a role-playing game.\n\nWhich brings me to where I'm really genuinely impressed with Dragonfall. Here you have a well written story, with choices that will dramatically affect you - if not so much the game (few cause repercussions beyond a serious heart-to-heart with your team). Like a lot of good RPGs are wont to do, Dragonfall offers up a buttload of non-binary morality and forces you to pick a side in a game where every side is just as bad as another. It's not all A+ in terms of originality, but it sure seems to matter at the time. The prominent characters of the game are also written relatively well, and their designs are certainly awe-inspiring at times.\n\nIt's impossible to summarise all the positive and negative qualities of this game, but also deserving of a mention is the soundtrack - which continues to be fantastic at creating the right atmosphere - and the quality of the background art, which uses some kind of devil-magic to work perfectly with the 3D character models. Finally, I should say that along with the main campaign (which in itself is around 20 hours of quality gameplay) you'll be getting access to community-made campaigns and a toolset which, as far as I've seen so far, is surprisingly easy to use.\n\nThus, and in conclusion, I heartily recommend Shadowrun: Dragonfall; it finally does what Harebrained Schemes so nearly achieved with Shadowrun Returns, and is ultimately an exemplary addition to the existing Shadowrun canon.","October 28, 2014","true","21.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The graphics are neat, the sound appropriate, gameplay is about 25h, but the best thing is the story telling and the world it is set in. The Director's Cut adds a few more missions than the original Dragonfall, notably ones which dig deepter into your teammates' past. You also get a slightly improved combat interface, well done!\n\n\n\nThere are some technical issues on Linux:\n\n- Every time you start Steam, the game tries to sync, preventing playing or installing anything else for about a minute.\n\n- Every time you start the game, you need to change the screen resolution and then cancel that action for the previously configured resolution to have an effect.\n\n- You cannot exit the game, it needs to be killed manually.","October 6, 2014","true","23.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Dragonfall moves beyond the tropes, it is set in a fictionalized Berlin, where quaint German/  European names become a post modern simulicrum that vaguely echoes Wagners Neibelungen. Some of the scenes in the game are a kind of pay off for long developed story elements that were unexpected and disconcerting enough to be "water cooler" moments to the right crowd (Probably no one I know). What starts off as clunky tropes becomes a meditation on the idea of essence sacrificed to technology and the ideas of spirit within the Shadowrun game.

So what does that mean ?\n\nShort version: If you liked the original Shadowrun Returns, and you didn't get the expansion yet, you will want to pick this up as it's an improvement all the way.\nIf you already had the DLC, you'll have gotten this stand-alone version for free.\nIf you never played Shadowrun Returns, but are looking at a decently priced RPG fix, start here.\n\n\nShadowrun, for the uninitiated, is a Cyberpunk setting where the players normally run around as mercenaries, looking for the next big paycheck, unravelling various corporate conspiracies, and occasionally saving the world. So you have cybernetically enhanced warriors, hackers, drone riggers and such. The big twist is that in this setting, magic returned to the world in 2012, giving rise to metahumans (elves, dwarves, orcs & trolls) and Awakened people (various kinds of spellcasters), opening up the possibility of being invaded by spirits and other stuff normally found in fantasy settings. Mix all that into a cohesive whole, and you have Shadowrun at it's best.\n\nShadowrun Returns did a fair job at laying the foundation, and the editor provided resulted in a good amount of user-created content. The problem was that the main campaign, Dead Man Switch, wasn't very well balanced and had a nasty case of Bad Plot Twist.\nWhere it did work well, it showed you can basically the combat system from XCOM: Enemy Unkown and build a fully-functional RPG with turn-based combat out of that, complete with branching dialogs, non-linear scenarios, NPC management etc.\n\nThen came the Dragonfall DLC, which is a new campaign, moving the setting to a new city with new characters (in-game hints suggest it runs parallel to Dead Man Switch time-wise). It came with much stronger writing and much better level design, to the point where it competes with classics such as Baldur's Gate and/or Planescape: Torment. It also does a much better job at driving home the gray-and-grey morality of the settings.\n\nAnd now, that DLC got expanded, and was released running on an upgraded version of the game engine. That's the director's cut. It includes more missions, tying in to your regular team members and/or the setting's background, a revamped UI that's more convenient in how it lays out the various skills, the ability to select upgrades for your crew, expanded combat systems , and a bunch of other small improvents.\n\nThe total package almost makes the first Shadowrun Returns obsolete. I say almost, because although this edition still comes with the editor, user generated content from the Shadowrun Returns needs to be converted and republished by the authors, so there's a risk you'll lose out on your favorite user-made campagin","September 28, 2014","true","48.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This has a very interesting urge for me to try out not just games like this but reminds me of Arcanum Steamworks and Magica (which is like this, except for the fact that it's like the 18th century mixed with magic and races that you would expect to see only in a standard RPG).\nThis is cool though, as it is not just in modern day mixed with orcs, humans, dwarves, elves and trolls like world of warcraft, but also forty years in the future and not in the U.S. which brings it a nice international feel.\n\nThus I like this, but a few things. I am ok with turn based games, because I grew up with them. However other players have to like turn based combat.\n\nSecondly it is pretty good, overall as I just said, however, on some missions, like the one I am on right now helping blitz, I will say a few things. I played this on normal and the combat is too hard.\nAt least it was for me, so I had to play on easy. Also again I wish there were recommendations on exactly what to bring with you on a mission, such as a ton of medical kits, because what was suppose to be a easy run helping blitz pay back a debt, has turned out pretty wickedly hard.\n\nOutside of that, I would of liked to have seen a few more races, like if forty or some years has passed, since this awakening, and magic came back to world and now you have orcs, dwarves, elves, and trolls as well as humans, I would have liked to see some half stuff. Such as half elves, half orcs, half trolls etc. Though the orcs and trolls and elves in the game already look like human beings just with some slight differences, (nice touch with the horns) with trolls for instance, maybe half-golems, (like half stone golems; half water elemental humans,;centaur people;) and also what about goblins? Full and half goblins would have been nice?\nMaybe again this is too much, but maybe in a future game that is continuing off where this game leaves off? The metahumans could have undergone more changes, making them really appear more orc and troll like, (such as in world of warcraft) and the half orcs, trolls, and maybe goblins could be somewhere in between.\n\nAnyway maybe in a future game where it's like five to ten years later, meaning in 2064? As of right now this game is overall pretty good.\nI would give it a B+ to A-.","September 27, 2014","true","96.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

Dragonfall manages to improve considerably on Shadowrun Returns in many respects, so if you have tried that already be assured that this instalment is a big jump in quality and storytelling.  Dragonfall was initially a very expansive DLC expansion for Shadowrun Returns, this Directors Cut is a standalone game that has again been considerably upgraded and expanded making it closer to a full sequel. (If you bought Dragonfall before, you will find this added to your Steam library for free).\n\nThe game also includes a powerful editor allowing players to create their own content.  Like the Directors Cut, the editor has also been upgraded which should allow for the community to continue creating plenty of additional content.  I think this is very good value for money and well worth a shot for any sci-fi RPG fan.","September 27, 2014","true","30.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

However, the dragonfall: director's cut takes an alreayd solid game and shoots it into the stratosphere. The interfact is slicker, it is now a lot more responsive (things happen quicker, animations are much better), comat is much more logical, tactical, and fun. More spells, misssions, character development. EVERYTHING is just plain better. And best of all, IT WAS FREE BECAUSE I ALREADY OWNED DF. Congrats Harebrained Schemes!!!!

So what does that mean ?\n\nShort version: If you liked the original Shadowrun Returns, and you didn't get the expansion yet, you will want to pick this up as it's an improvement all the way.\nIf you already had the DLC, you'll have gotten this stand-alone version for free.\nIf you never played Shadowrun Returns, but are looking at a decently priced RPG fix, start here.\n\n\nShadowrun, for the uninitiated, is a Cyberpunk setting where the players normally run around as mercenaries, looking for the next big paycheck, unravelling various corporate conspiracies, and occasionally saving the world. So you have cybernetically enhanced warriors, hackers, drone riggers and such. The big twist is that in this setting, magic returned to the world in 2012, giving rise to metahumans (elves, dwarves, orcs & trolls) and Awakened people (various kinds of spellcasters), opening up the possibility of being invaded by spirits and other stuff normally found in fantasy settings. Mix all that into a cohesive whole, and you have Shadowrun at it's best.\n\nShadowrun Returns did a fair job at laying the foundation, and the editor provided resulted in a good amount of user-created content. The problem was that the main campaign, Dead Man Switch, wasn't very well balanced and had a nasty case of Bad Plot Twist.\nWhere it did work well, it showed you can basically the combat system from XCOM: Enemy Unkown and build a fully-functional RPG with turn-based combat out of that, complete with branching dialogs, non-linear scenarios, NPC management etc.\n\nThen came the Dragonfall DLC, which is a new campaign, moving the setting to a new city with new characters (in-game hints suggest it runs parallel to Dead Man Switch time-wise). It came with much stronger writing and much better level design, to the point where it competes with classics such as Baldur's Gate and/or Planescape: Torment. It also does a much better job at driving home the gray-and-grey morality of the settings.\n\nAnd now, that DLC got expanded, and was released running on an upgraded version of the game engine. That's the director's cut. It includes more missions, tying in to your regular team members and/or the setting's background, a revamped UI that's more convenient in how it lays out the various skills, the ability to select upgrades for your crew, expanded combat systems , and a bunch of other small improvents.\n\nThe total package almost makes the first Shadowrun Returns obsolete. I say almost, because although this edition still comes with the editor, user generated content from the Shadowrun Returns needs to be converted and republished by the authors, so there's a risk you'll lose out on your favorite user-made campagin","September 28, 2014","true","48.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But not for the reasons you might think. This game is a very good example on how you convert a rich and deep enviroment and source material into a pc game and it is a very good example as well on how not to do it.\n\nFirstly let me point out the good stuff.\n\nThe storytelling is excellent. It is very clear that the creators are some of the people who actually made the pen and paper version of Shadowrun. The story, the characters and the setting are spot on. This game proves that you do not have to have voice actors for every bit of dialog to make it good.\n\nThe grafik design is very good. This is how Shadowrun should look like. The character portaits are nice and fitting.\n\nThe game is a true role play game. You got character classes and you better play them according to their skills. This is not a you can have it all - example and that is a good thing.\n\nThe soundtrack is brilliant. It reflects the general feel of the game and the situation your characters are in.\n\nThe main quest line is thrilling and its length is appropriate. The cimax of the story is well developed and satisfying.\n\nThe bad stuff:\n\nThe UI is terrible. Why you can not see your health bar while not in combat and why you need to dig deep in character and inventory screens to use a simple medpack is a mystery to solve. The general usability is rather poor. Avatars will several times be in the way of your cursor preventing you from reaching a certain spot.\n\nPathfinding is poor. Why you have to "expand" your Action Points based running distance instead of having the game find the direct route using as many APs as needed is beyond my understanding. The feedback the game gives you using switches and dialog options is poor.\n\nThe combat system works well on a table among friends where bad dice rolls are fun but it is not suited for a pc game. The frustration level is extreme. Your crack team of shadowrunners will miss point blank buck shots and it will miss often. The cover system is hard to figure out. The cover level does often not resemble the actual obstacle you are hiding behind. Wooden structures sometimes provide better cover than concrete.\n\nEnemies are not diverse enough. You basically fight the same set of enemies in different colors. Interesting battles are rather rare and that is a shame considering the source. Matrix fights are as well rather generic.\n\nThe enemy AI is both predictable and erratic. Enemies will almost always target your weakest group members and will suicide run into your stronger fighters. They will spam grenades always as soon as your characters are closer than three tiles.  Combined with my point about the combat system leading to often hilarious outcomes of shots and melee atacks make tactis rather pointless. If you are outnumbered and outgunned and outskilled which will happen very often you basically have to rely on setting up traps  for one or two enemies cause the combat is that unpredictable.\n\nThis is a major factor for me and I know for many gamers. The game is good and fun for people who love the source but it can be a tedious task and ridiculous gamble for those who expect a X-Com like experience. It is not that.\n\n","September 29, 2014","true","83.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/freakish_light/recommended/300550/","freakish_light","Prosthetic Conscience","http://steamcommunity.com/id/freakish_light/","485 products in account","Dragonfall Director's Cut is an interesting game.  It's based in Shadowrun, a fantasy-cyberpunk setting that's pretty neat.  All of the usual players are here: dragons (a main component of this campaign), trolls, orcs, elves from the fantasy side; from the cyberpunk side you get stuff like artificial augmented limbs, The Matrix cyberspace, guns, swords, designer drugs that affect combat, and a lot more.\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nIt plays as a turn-based tactical game, bearing some resemblance to the newest XCOM.  Actions are based on AP and there are various ways to alter that number, both for your characters and the enemies.  Several attacks have -AP and often stun enemies for a turn, giving a bit of breathing room.  There are also multiple ways to increase AP and give yourself more actions per turn and this adds variety and even more strategy on top.  The cover system adds complexity as well, as there's a risk-reward choice inherent in there:  do you stay safely behind cover and suffer reduced hit chance and the possibility that your shot will only hit for half damage?  Or do you rush around to flank, possibly leaving yourself exposed but at a better advantage with an opportunity to maybe kill that enemy this turn?  I enjoyed the style of gameplay a lot from this perspective.\n\nThe flip side of the hit % chance model is that it's all based on dicerolls, and the way the stats work out can lead to some funky scenarios.  For example, my shotgun specialist character is standing at point-blank range with another enemy and I only have a 65% chance to hit?  I played on Hard, because I found the vanilla Shadowrun Returns a little too easy, so that might have something to do with it, but it's still frustrating and a little weird that scenarios like that happen.\n\nThe gameplay gets an upgrade from vainilla Returns as well.  Several new kinds of weapons are introduced, including Eiger's sniper rifle -- a weapon that increases accuracy the further you get from a target, instead of closer, and Glory's hand razors that can cause bleeding per round and AP damage.  Weapon, spell and program selection is also a little easier this time around, as the HUD has been redesigned to show more information more easily.\n\nThe most striking difference between them, I think, is the fact that this time you get a more static party, and you can do more with them.  This was definitely a complaint I had about regular Returns, in that for every mission you were hiring mercs to go with you, and you had no way to influence their loadout or progression.  In fact, you couldn't even use team members to pass skill checks, which seemed arbitrarily limiting and frustrating.  Not so in Dragonfall!  Here, if you hit a Decking skill check, for example, you just call over your Decker and he passes it -- assuming his skill is high enough.\n\nThere are still some character-specific checks you need to pass, like some charisma or etiquette checks, but they're a little more reasonable in terms of general skills you can invest in to be able to still build the character you want to play.\n\nThe only major complaint I have is being unable to manage your companions' inventory outside of combat, or have them pick things up when they have free space.  Just because my main character doesn't have more inventory space doesn't mean that I should have to leave health kits or grenades... but that's exactly what happened when I found some outside of combat.  Inside combat, you can just control them directly and have them pick things up, but outside there's no way to take control of anyone but your PC.  This could even be addressed by being able to start combat at any time to gain control of your characters, and then when you're done just hit End.  Again, it seems unnecessary and a little arbitrary to limit items like this.\n\nThere's also some companion customization in terms of items and abilities, which is new this time around; every time they level up there's a new icon in the bottom right that lets you pick one of two options that increases one of their specialties.  With Glory, for example, you can pick between better healing or a new pistol.  It's nice to tailor them a little more to your playstyle without having to dive all the way into the level up screen and try to allocate points for five or six different characters.\n\nSTORY:\nI'll be honest, after the regular Shadowrun campaign I wasn't expecting that much from the story this time around.  I had read that it was improved but the vanilla game left a lot to be desired, so really any improvement would be a welcome addition.  I was pleasantly surprised, though.  In terms of pacing, structure, and impact the writing in this game is miles above Shadowrun Returns.  Even the nitty-gritty mechanics of the writing have been improved, as a lot of the awkwardness of the prose in the first game has been done away with.  The characters are dynamic and a lot more fleshed-out, the moral choices and consequences seem a lot more difficult, and you find yourself not knowing who to trust or who is even telling you the truth.\n\nYour companions receive a similar boost and they're all unique.  They all have unique dialogue that relates to whatever mission you're on, and if they don't agree with something you're doing they'll let you know.  You can also talk to them at your home base to get a sense of their backstory, though you'll have to complete missions before they really open up about their pasts.  The conclusion to this is a companion quest, where you can't bring anyone else, and the two of these I played were superb, both in terms of mission structure and the quality of the writing.  Some loose ends were left dangling, though I'm not sure if I just missed another quest opportunity for one because I was at the end of the game.\n\nOVERVIEW:\n\nAll in all, I really enjoyed my time with Dragonfall, even if Hard was maybe a little too frustrating for me.  The game definitely has some legs, as there's incentive to go back with a different character build and make different decisions.  There are multiple major branching points where the paths seem to diverge quite a lot, and I'd like to see what some of the others are like.  Different character builds offer more opportunities for passing skill checks as well, and bringing different companions will offer a new point of view on some of the events.\n\nI played Shadowrun Returns first, and I don't think I regret it, but it's not quite as polished an experience as Dragonfall, and some of the characters do cross over, plus there are some minor references to the original campaign, Dead Man's Switch, in here.  Mostly I'd recommend playing that one first just to see how far the team has come since then.  Dragonfall is definitely worth your time, though, and if you don't want to slog through the first one (or pay the money for it) this is a perfectly recommendable title in itself.\n\nIf you like CRPGs based on pen-and-paper games, reading, and a really good story, you can't go wrong with Dragonfall.","September 30, 2014","true","18.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The story, character interaction and wonderfully written Dialogue is where the game in my opinion really shines.\nOn top of that the game includes a complete toolkit for building your own Stories, so you can expand on the game as much as you want to.\nThe Director's Cut improves some elements of the UI and either tweaked the armor+cover system or at least gave the player more information on how they work and if (and how much) enemies have either of them.\nIt also changes/expands a few Missions and adds new ones into the main campaign.\nAll in all great work and if you already have Dragonfall you automatically get the Director's Cut...now thats a sign of a great company.\nRock on Harebrained =)","September 30, 2014","true","21.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Because of the multiple character types and the depth of story telling and that aforementioned ability to make decisions, there is a high degree of re-playability here. The multiple plot twists were well conceived and in some cases so perfectly concealed that my jaw dropped a few times.\n\nCombine that with some very challenging scenarios and tightly timed sequences which add an excitement factor rare in games these days (many seem too concerened with getting to the cut scene at all cost), I can only hope this series continues on (a Hong Kong Shadowrun would be magnificent!) and perhaps that some effort is made to bridge these iterations together in future so that character importing would be possible.\n\nLoved this. My first Dragonfall character was a Trollish Physical Adept - not much on detective skills, but laying my fists to the enemy was fun: manos de piedra!

While playing, you will be able to roleplay your character starting by simply talking to others in different kind of ways up to deciding major plot points. Beware, you will need to read a lot of text, if you do not like that, you will prop. have a hard time. The tactic part is really solid and with the new additions of the "Director's Cut" pretty indepth. That said, it does not quite reach the depth of other games (XCOM), which is understandable regarding the budget. The graphic is very atmospheric, but the animations tend to be a bit stiff. Thanks to the editor, you will be able to play new stories made by other players. If you like to read and influence a good story (and/or If you like pen and paper rpgs) or if you enjoy classic RPGs like Baldurs Gate, do try the game. I would recommend reading abit about shadowrun beforehand, but you don't have to.

I'm biased. Sue me.\n\nOkay this game isnt perfection. Compared to Fallout it's a little bit on rails and not quite so open world, or at least the Dragonfall campaign is. However there is a certain degree of choice over what run's you take on, how you complete them and lots of alternate endings and moral dilema's to take different options on.  There have been a few annoying glitches where a mission cant end if you've still got a enemy active (even behind locked doors) which meant doing over in a different way (however patches incoming). I would love to be able to name save games but you can save pretty much anytime and the 'restart level' and auto saves are good.\n\nThe campaign is pretty awesome folks. I havent finished it yet...but some of the runs actualy had me on the edge of my seat. I mean for a turn based tac sim to have you watching the turn counter tick down, to have it come down to wire again and again...really got the feel of the game. Side runs to grab paydata or free innocents at the risk of the party, locked doors in the way as the bomb timer ticks down, real heart of shadowrun, your 'runners pounding the corridors of some Corp lair, the heavy responce team on your heels as you head for the extraction point.... .Decking is integrated well without forcing you into it massively...Magic seems fun. Combat works well. Blows Fallout III out of the water for me.\n\nIf you like Shadowrun or Fallout I and II then buy this game.","September 26, 2014","true","89.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

So what does that mean ?\n\nShort version: If you liked the original Shadowrun Returns, and you didn't get the expansion yet, you will want to pick this up as it's an improvement all the way.\nIf you already had the DLC, you'll have gotten this stand-alone version for free.\nIf you never played Shadowrun Returns, but are looking at a decently priced RPG fix, start here.\n\n\nShadowrun, for the uninitiated, is a Cyberpunk setting where the players normally run around as mercenaries, looking for the next big paycheck, unravelling various corporate conspiracies, and occasionally saving the world. So you have cybernetically enhanced warriors, hackers, drone riggers and such. The big twist is that in this setting, magic returned to the world in 2012, giving rise to metahumans (elves, dwarves, orcs & trolls) and Awakened people (various kinds of spellcasters), opening up the possibility of being invaded by spirits and other stuff normally found in fantasy settings. Mix all that into a cohesive whole, and you have Shadowrun at it's best.\n\nShadowrun Returns did a fair job at laying the foundation, and the editor provided resulted in a good amount of user-created content. The problem was that the main campaign, Dead Man Switch, wasn't very well balanced and had a nasty case of Bad Plot Twist.\nWhere it did work well, it showed you can basically the combat system from XCOM: Enemy Unkown and build a fully-functional RPG with turn-based combat out of that, complete with branching dialogs, non-linear scenarios, NPC management etc.\n\nThen came the Dragonfall DLC, which is a new campaign, moving the setting to a new city with new characters (in-game hints suggest it runs parallel to Dead Man Switch time-wise). It came with much stronger writing and much better level design, to the point where it competes with classics such as Baldur's Gate and/or Planescape: Torment. It also does a much better job at driving home the gray-and-grey morality of the settings.\n\nAnd now, that DLC got expanded, and was released running on an upgraded version of the game engine. That's the director's cut. It includes more missions, tying in to your regular team members and/or the setting's background, a revamped UI that's more convenient in how it lays out the various skills, the ability to select upgrades for your crew, expanded combat systems , and a bunch of other small improvents.\n\nThe total package almost makes the first Shadowrun Returns obsolete. I say almost, because although this edition still comes with the editor, user generated content from the Shadowrun Returns needs to be converted and republished by the authors, so there's a risk you'll lose out on your favorite user-made campagin","September 28, 2014","true","48.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Forget about Shadowrun Returns and get this. Dragonfall is a fantastic campaign that's even better now. There appear to be less bugs (I've not run into a particularly annoying, and thankfully rare, vision bug that existed when I played the original Dragonfall), and the new content is just a great as the old. There's very few things that could change my opinon for the worse at the point that I've gotten to.\n\nShadowrun: Dragonfall is a good game. A really good one. It feels like a CRPG from over a decade ago, and I say that in the best way possible. It honestly feels like it could have been made by Troika, and I say that in both a good and bad way.\n\nWhat do I mean by "both a good an a bad way"? Well, the game has some good writing, genuinely interesting characters, and a sold cobat system. The game also suffers from a few technical issues.\n\nWhen speaking of a the combat system, we're looking at a very XCOM esque sort of feel complete with grid-based movement and overwatch for helping to keep areas locked down. You'll likely often find yourself moving your characters from cover to cover while pushing forward and taking down enemies. The combat system works on a cooldown system for abilities, in which once an ability is used, it cannot be reused for X number of turns. All in all, the game actually offers satisfying tactical RPG experience complete with guns, magic, and swords.\n\nIn terms of the technical issues, there's only a few I've noticed (or heard of), and that's if your screen isn't side enough, your HUD won't properly downsize to accomodate the lower resolution. Rather than getting smaller, it will display less skills, meaning if you have a full set of skills, you can't access them all (at least, to my knowledge). This means that even on an old SD monitor you have to use HD resolutions to be able to play the game well, even if this makes it look bad. Also, the UI seems to be a bit unresponsive when decking, so when I'm clicking around too fast (which is not fast at all by the way) I'll end up throwing out a regular attack when I mean to be using a special ability on an enemy. That's a small gripe though.\n\nWriting is... pretty subjective obviously, but I enjoyed it quite a bit. I really liked all of the characters, I found converstations interesting, I liked learning about the past of my companions, and I liked watching them grow as I continued to run with them. The chararacter aren't exactly super dynamic, as there'll never be huge changes in their personality, but still, as you converse with them, you can tell they're growing, which is actually more than I can say for quite a few other titles in the genre. The game also offers a number of choices in dialogue and otherwise, which allow you to influence the outcome of situations and the overall story. Aside from that, doing things one way over another may provide more karma (experience) or money.\n\nSeriously, the game is well worth giving a go (assuming it looks like the kind of game you'd be into of course).","September 22, 2014","true","26.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's probably my favorite game. Having said that you should know that I grew up playing the SNES version of Shadowrun, and at that time, it too was one of my favorite games of my childhood. When I heard they were making a new version that was going to have the style of gameplay and heart of that game I was sold.\n\nNow having played it, many times over, I can't stop but reminisce of my times as a young adult playing the SNES version. In doing so have jumped into a time machine of happiness. This is one of the reasons why I love the game. I transports me back to the time when I was a kid, falling in love with a world that sparked my imagination.\n\nI've heard some nit-picking about certain elements of the game, among of which are having to actually READ THE DIALOGUE. To comments like this I have no real response, only bafflement. As to some of the other more constructive criticisms I have heard they have also been heard by HBS. Heard, and dealt with.\n\nHBS seems to be the right people behind this project and I applaud them for both the resulting game and their continued determination to make it even better. I marked on the calendar the day the Directors Cut was coming out and have been playing it every moment I can get away.\n\nAs I said earlier, I love this game, it is probably my favorite game. I also appreciate the passion behind the making of it and look forward to supporting it as long as HBS continues to generate content. Which if you reading this HBS: PLEASE CONTINUE. I BEG OF THEE!

Because of the multiple character types and the depth of story telling and that aforementioned ability to make decisions, there is a high degree of re-playability here. The multiple plot twists were well conceived and in some cases so perfectly concealed that my jaw dropped a few times.\n\nCombine that with some very challenging scenarios and tightly timed sequences which add an excitement factor rare in games these days (many seem too concerened with getting to the cut scene at all cost), I can only hope this series continues on (a Hong Kong Shadowrun would be magnificent!) and perhaps that some effort is made to bridge these iterations together in future so that character importing would be possible.\n\nLoved this. My first Dragonfall character was a Trollish Physical Adept - not much on detective skills, but laying my fists to the enemy was fun: manos de piedra! Think my next go-round will be a custom-build technomancer type.\n\n","October 1, 2014","true","67.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Dragonfall moves beyond the tropes, it is set in a fictionalized Berlin, where quaint German/  European names become a post modern simulicrum that vaguely echoes Wagners Neibelungen. Some of the scenes in the game are a kind of pay off for long developed story elements that were unexpected and disconcerting enough to be "water cooler" moments to the right crowd (Probably no one I know). What starts off as clunky tropes becomes a meditation on the idea of essence sacrificed to technology and the ideas of spirit within the Shadowrun game.

It's game that makes me care for characters I met. I wanted to know their stories and their stories and motivatopms are good, not usually mambo-jumbo most games are offering now.\nAre there any cons?

The story has the perfect balance of non-linearity and great story-telling, which is rare in this genre. The story and gameplay combine into an awesome combination of progression that is increadibily addicting.\n\nThe original was a good 20-30 hours, and this Director's Cut apparently adds even more content. Add that to a never-ending stream of quality user-generated content in the fully supported Steam Workshop, and this game would be worth  the money at double the cost.\n\nThe dialogue system is also unique, where knowing a lot about knifes or drones can open up new converstation options.\n\nThe only con, is that the combat itself can sometimes feel a little lack-luster.

I'm biased. Sue me.\n\nOkay this game isnt perfection. Compared to Fallout it's a little bit on rails and not quite so open world, or at least the Dragonfall campaign is. However there is a certain degree of choice over what run's you take on, how you complete them and lots of alternate endings and moral dilema's to take different options on.  There have been a few annoying glitches where a mission cant end if you've still got a enemy active (even behind locked doors) which meant doing over in a different way (however patches incoming). I would love to be able to name save games but you can save pretty much anytime and the 'restart level' and auto saves are good.\n\nThe campaign is pretty awesome folks. I havent finished it yet...but some of the runs actualy had me on the edge of my seat. I mean for a turn based tac sim to have you watching the turn counter tick down, to have it come down to wire again and again...really got the feel of the game. Side runs to grab paydata or free innocents at the risk of the party, locked doors in the way as the bomb timer ticks down, real heart of shadowrun, your 'runners pounding the corridors of some Corp lair, the heavy responce team on your heels as you head for the extraction point.... .Decking is integrated well without forcing you into it massively...Magic seems fun. Combat works well. Blows Fallout III out of the water for me.\n\nIf you like Shadowrun or Fallout I and II then buy this game.","September 26, 2014","true","89.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's a classic-style RPG filled with complex moral choices, story consequences for those choices, and exciting moral dilemmas all over the place. The combat is strong, the exploration elements act in aid of the story, and the environments feel rich and filled with small, important details. The characters are rich, party members and incidental characters alike, and many of the lategame dialogue scenes are so chillingly well written you'll debate what to say with a sense of genuine empathy-slash-anxiety.\n\nTo return to the combat, it's a really satisfying tactical experience: not the best in the genre, but far above the RPG standard for certain. You've likely seen tactical combat like this before - action points, light/half/full cover to crouch behind, special abilities, consumable grenades and medkits - but it's executed to a high degree of competency, and preserving your squad through a gruelling shadowrun with good positioning and smart use of their limited resources feels great. Customising your characters' abilities, through advancements and decisions made on their personal quests, lets you strike up unique synergies between squadmates that feel uniquely yours: by the end of the game, your preferred shadowrunning squad will feel like a well-oiled unit with a playbook of diverse strategies.\n\nEven then, the combat is just a satisfying aperitif to the excellent world and story, which are certain to draw you in and leave you dazzled with their perspicacity.

Means you can jump into any game and you really haven't missed much (plus its easy to go back to SR, and from what I can tell of Hong Kong it'll be just as easy to come back to DF). Keeps it from getting too heavy, and the Shadowrun universe is very .... flexible? It lends itself to telling interesting, self-contained stories that draw from several genres, sci-fi, cyber-punk, fantasy, espionage, talking dragons that wear italian suits, talking dragons that don't wear much at all, corporate conspiracy, drugs, philosophical and moral questions about (meta)humanity, shooting things in the face for money, shooting things in the face just because you can, convincing things to just shoot themselves in the face, family over all else; all that stuff in a nice, neat little package.\n\nWang-in-the-face turn-based tactics gameplay but there's a difficulty slider, and some firefights can be avoided/altered in your favor, and you can save basically any time there isn't movement on-screen (save often, and keep multiple saves).  ALWAYS HAVE A DECKER IN YOUR CREW, ALWAYSALWAYSALWAYS, else you WILL miss out on ... things. It was a bigger deal in Returns but its still a thing here as well. I'd consider investing some decking skills and a datajack in your main character if not rolling as primarily a decker, the one provided for your crew has weak combat skills and generally has little use in combat other than using up health items, while you have a good healer, a tank, and a dps all available as free crewmembers from the outset; your mileage will vary though.\n\nSome of the user campaigns have made rattles across the internet, there's even a sandbox-esque mod available I believe.  anyway its a moot point now, if you haven't played a Shadowrun game and are interested...well, pick any of them, they're all good and all play/look roughly the same (Dragonfall is superior to Returns but in very small ways, Hong Kong obviously is the best looking so far).  The modders have been good about porting their stuff to each new game, the UGC editor is good like that.\n\nAvoid the Shadowrun wikis unless you're an avid drug user.\nYou've been warned.","September 10, 2015","true","44.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's a classic-style RPG filled with complex moral choices, story consequences for those choices, and exciting moral dilemmas all over the place. The combat is strong, the exploration elements act in aid of the story, and the environments feel rich and filled with small, important details. The characters are rich, party members and incidental characters alike, and many of the lategame dialogue scenes are so chillingly well written you'll debate what to say with a sense of genuine empathy-slash-anxiety.\n\nTo return to the combat, it's a really satisfying tactical experience: not the best in the genre, but far above the RPG standard for certain. You've likely seen tactical combat like this before - action points, light/half/full cover to crouch behind, special abilities, consumable grenades and medkits - but it's executed to a high degree of competency, and preserving your squad through a gruelling shadowrun with good positioning and smart use of their limited resources feels great. Customising your characters' abilities, through advancements and decisions made on their personal quests, lets you strike up unique synergies between squadmates that feel uniquely yours: by the end of the game, your preferred shadowrunning squad will feel like a well-oiled unit with a playbook of diverse strategies.\n\nEven then, the combat is just a satisfying aperitif to the excellent world and story, which are certain to draw you in and leave you dazzled with their perspicacity. A gigantic success and a triumph of the genre, Dragonfall is absolutely one of the best games of its kind ever made.

Means you can jump into any game and you really haven't missed much (plus its easy to go back to SR, and from what I can tell of Hong Kong it'll be just as easy to come back to DF). Keeps it from getting too heavy, and the Shadowrun universe is very .... flexible? It lends itself to telling interesting, self-contained stories that draw from several genres, sci-fi, cyber-punk, fantasy, espionage, talking dragons that wear italian suits, talking dragons that don't wear much at all, corporate conspiracy, drugs, philosophical and moral questions about (meta)humanity, shooting things in the face for money, shooting things in the face just because you can, convincing things to just shoot themselves in the face, family over all else; all that stuff in a nice, neat little package.\n\nWang-in-the-face turn-based tactics gameplay but there's a difficulty slider, and some firefights can be avoided/altered in your favor, and you can save basically any time there isn't movement on-screen (save often, and keep multiple saves).  ALWAYS HAVE A DECKER IN YOUR CREW, ALWAYSALWAYSALWAYS, else you WILL miss out on ... things. It was a bigger deal in Returns but its still a thing here as well. I'd consider investing some decking skills and a datajack in your main character if not rolling as primarily a decker, the one provided for your crew has weak combat skills and generally has little use in combat other than using up health items, while you have a good healer, a tank, and a dps all available as free crewmembers from the outset; your mileage will vary though.\n\nSome of the user campaigns have made rattles across the internet, there's even a sandbox-esque mod available I believe.  anyway its a moot point now, if you haven't played a Shadowrun game and are interested...well, pick any of them, they're all good and all play/look roughly the same (Dragonfall is superior to Returns but in very small ways, Hong Kong obviously is the best looking so far).  The modders have been good about porting their stuff to each new game, the UGC editor is good like that.\n\nAvoid the Shadowrun wikis unless you're an avid drug user.\nYou've been warned.","September 10, 2015","true","44.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is refreshing to see a developer that not only listens to the fans, but does something about their feedback! Even more impressive is their decision to give this version for free to those who already bought Dragonfall as an expansion.\n\nLike the original, Dragonfall serves up a big slice of isometric turn-based strategy fun set in the dystropian / utopian (strike based on your views) Shadowrun universe. Magic once again meets technology, and in the shadows of megacorporations people struggle to survive, or even thrive. The cast features very interesting characters, each with their own backstory and motivations. Also like the original, this is worth a replay for its story, though the story is larger and better in almost every way in Dragonfall.\n\nPro:\n*A stand-alone improvement on the expansion which was already an improvement on the original game.\n*A setting that never fails to engage, regardless of whether you hate or love the way the world has become in Shadowrun.\n*A developer that not only listens but actually acts upon feedback, and actively supports the community.\n*A community that releases new content using the game creation tools and assets that the developers released free of charge with the game.\n*The same exellent character portraits, with more thrown in!\n*Good, solid turn-based mechanics.\n*You can once again build your character's stats and abilities as you want them, or just use the pre-defined classes.\n\nCon:\n*Still only one campaign, though many more avaliable through the community. Dare we hope for an expansion to this, or better yet, a sandbox mode?\n*While the in-game models have gotten some new hairstyles, they still clash a bit with the exellent character portraits (especially for the orcs and trolls).\n\nSummary:\nThis is an improvement in almost every way. If you own the original and liked it, this is for you. If you like classic isometric TBS games, this is for you. If you like the Shadowrun universe, this is for you. If the idea of cyberpunk or a setting that mixes fantasy and sci-fi, this is for you. While it may not be perfect, it is very, very good at what it does. 8/10 -Recomended!\n\nFor more recomendations and reviews: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/strandedkerbonaut#curation","October 2, 2014","true","33.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I took just over 30 hours to complete this instalment but it was still pretty satisfying. My review here will comment on features as a standalone game as well as in comparison to Returns.\n\nPros\n\n1. Good characterization of NPCs, nice turn-based combat system, unique and interesting soundtrack.\n2. I think there's a wider variety of weapons here, including those that stun (guns and grenades)\n3. I like the artwork and the atmosphere of the game -- very post-apocalyptic and cyberpunk\n\nCons\n\n1. There are a few bugs -- sometimes things temporarily freeze in the Matrix; you can move the mouse but can't click anything. This is not a big deal, after a minute or so things return to normal.\n2. Inventory management hasn't changed since the first game, and can be pain when you'd like to distribute items to your fellow runners (you can't). It's not a bug but a design feature, so hopefully they'll change this in time.\n3. The storyline isn't really as compelling as Returns. There are some twists and turns but they aren't very natural and seem a little contrived. The German setting is interesting but future storylines could do with some improvement.\n\nTrue to Shadowrun, there is no voice acting. And there is a LOT of dialog. But I don't consider these Cons, just features that hearken back to classic RPG type days. Some like it, some don't, others are neutral.\n\nAll in all, this was still very satisfying to play (especially when your runner is equipped with a minigun!) and as long as HBS keeps producing 'em, I'll keep playing 'em.\n\n7.0/10","December 17, 2015","true","37.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/any_thing/recommended/300550/","any_thing","godrik","http://steamcommunity.com/id/any_thing/","12 products in account","I am a long time player of tabletop RPGs and tactical RPGs and I must say that I loved this game. I just finished the game for the first time in Hard difficulty and I plan on playing it again in the highest difficulty next. The game is the second in a serie of (currently 3) but I feel like the stories are disconnected so you probably can play them in any order.\n\nThe story is great and well set in the shadowrun universe. Characters are well written with a deeper and often darker aspect to discover. The storyline is not too complex to follow but complex enough to enjoy.\n\nThe battles in the game know how to be stressful. Many of the "fights" are very well scripted with multiple actions to take in sequence that increase pressure on you. For instance there is a battle where you need to press two switching in two rooms in the real world while your decker has to open the way for you from the matrix. The game knows how to keep you on edge.\n\nGraphics are nothing too fancy but perfectly integrated in the style of the game. Though I played on a not so good for gaming laptop and had to set graphics setting low.\n\nThe main issues I had with this game are linked to the UI. It can be very frustrating at times. Here are a few things I found annoying in the interface. I'll detail that because I hope the developpers will read this and do what they can in future versions. I give a fairly long list but that is mostly to the developpers benefit. The game is good !\n\n-The combat rules are somewhat kept unknown. It is not clear to me what each statistic is doing or what some of the acronym stand for. A particular instance: Some weapon have a Ar-P statistic which I guess stands for Armor Piercing. When using it some of the armor points of the enemy unit blinks but seem to come back in the same round. I guess Armor Piercing is different from Armor Striping but making it clear would be nice. In the current form Armor seems to be a typical DR (damage reduction) and it is not clear to me that there is a real difference in practice between +3 Ar-P and +3 DMG.\n\n-the UI can be very hard to read for me. Maybe it is becuase I am color blind but the overlays in same tone can be quite hard to read. In particular, the techniques icon in the matrix often features white writing on white background and the cooldown of a not yet used technique can be hard to read.\n\n-the HP of an enemy can be very hard to read because its health bar is essentially hovering over the units head but whatever is behind that unit can make it hard to read. Even pointing to the unit does not really help: more information appear in  box that is transparent and depending on what is behind the text might be very hard to read. It could be fixed by giving a setting for the opacity of these infobox.\n\n-It is sometimes hard to understand what an action will do some actions might require you to move first but the "trajectory line" is small so you might not realize your character will have to move to accomplish this action. In comparison in FireEmblem, a (too) heavy line will show you the path your character will take.\n\n-Some attacks can damage neighbooring  unit (shotguns, miniguns, glory's closecombat), it would be good if the units potentially in the line of fire could be indicated. especially the shotgun widespread shot can be fairly hard to predict.\n\n-It can be very hard to point to some tiles in the game. Trying to move 4 characters on a 2x2 area is very difficult because you keep on pointing to one of the character.\n\n-When healing outside of combat, I find it annoying that I can not see who has inventory and who needs healing. A simple tweak would be to display a "currentHP"/"maxHP" information next to the character's name in the "who to heal" dialog.\n\n-In terms of gameplay, some things were annoying as well. You can not give an ally an item once the mission has started. I ended up in ridiculous situations where the leaders inventory was full but Glory's inventory was empty and when finding an item I had to send it to the stash.\n\n-It would be good if some action (reload in particular) could span between two rounds. Often with the apex' drone shooting costs 2AP and reloading costs 2AP but the drone only has 3 AP. I'd like to be able to fire, start reloading and pay -1AP next round to complete reloading.","January 2","true","65.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

That said, I really love it and am very impressed with both the story and the gameplay. If you are new to the genre, like me, you likely will feel confused when you first start playing. There is a bit of a learning curve, and the interface won't feel entirely intuitive, but, if you are new to the genre, I would recommend you stick with the game, and you will surely get the hang of things soon enough. The character development and story are excellent, but, be warned, you will be doing a lot of reading in this game. I didn't mind this aspect of the game at all. In fact, the "game" feels very much like reading a novel in ways, albeit a "cyberpunk" futuristic one. It's not the kind of novel I would ever seek out (nor did I ever imagine I would ever actually write the words "cyberpunk" in my life), but, I must admit, the quality of the writing is exceptional. In addition to this being my first ever rpg, this is also my first ever "turn based combat" game and, man, do I ever love it! I'm really hooked on this game. I've come to learn that this is what's called an "isometric rpg," and I very much like this format although "isometric rpgs" aren't everyone's cup of tea. I'm really glad I took a chance on this game and stuck with it. I picked it up on sale, but, in my humble opinion, it is surely worth the $14.99 price. I'm nearly 22 hours into the game (my guess is experienced gamers have finished the game in less than that time), and it's been a lot of fun and an initiation of sorts too! My guess is this will be a game I end up replaying using a different character and making different choices, etc. Hope this helps anyone who is intrigued by the reviews and/or new to the genre. I highly recommend it!","October 3, 2015","true","23.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Gameplay feels more limited in DF. Especially if you're running as a street samurai, Hong Kong has so much more cyberware available. The Matrix also isn't that different from IRL combat, and the dialogue options when interacting with your team feel a lot more limited.\n\nThe story sure as hell holds up though. The added missions with the director's cut are also fantastic.\n\nI first played this game when it was DLC for Shadowrun Returns. Then I went and replayed it only a year later so I could check out the added content the director's cut added.

It's a classic-style RPG filled with complex moral choices, story consequences for those choices, and exciting moral dilemmas all over the place. The combat is strong, the exploration elements act in aid of the story, and the environments feel rich and filled with small, important details. The characters are rich, party members and incidental characters alike, and many of the lategame dialogue scenes are so chillingly well written you'll debate what to say with a sense of genuine empathy-slash-anxiety.\n\nTo return to the combat, it's a really satisfying tactical experience: not the best in the genre, but far above the RPG standard for certain. You've likely seen tactical combat like this before - action points, light/half/full cover to crouch behind, special abilities, consumable grenades and medkits - but it's executed to a high degree of competency, and preserving your squad through a gruelling shadowrun with good positioning and smart use of their limited resources feels great. Customising your characters' abilities, through advancements and decisions made on their personal quests, lets you strike up unique synergies between squadmates that feel uniquely yours: by the end of the game, your preferred shadowrunning squad will feel like a well-oiled unit with a playbook of diverse strategies.\n\nEven then, the combat is just a satisfying aperitif to the excellent world and story, which are certain to draw you in and leave you dazzled with their perspicacity.

Means you can jump into any game and you really haven't missed much (plus its easy to go back to SR, and from what I can tell of Hong Kong it'll be just as easy to come back to DF). Keeps it from getting too heavy, and the Shadowrun universe is very .... flexible? It lends itself to telling interesting, self-contained stories that draw from several genres, sci-fi, cyber-punk, fantasy, espionage, talking dragons that wear italian suits, talking dragons that don't wear much at all, corporate conspiracy, drugs, philosophical and moral questions about (meta)humanity, shooting things in the face for money, shooting things in the face just because you can, convincing things to just shoot themselves in the face, family over all else; all that stuff in a nice, neat little package.\n\nWang-in-the-face turn-based tactics gameplay but there's a difficulty slider, and some firefights can be avoided/altered in your favor, and you can save basically any time there isn't movement on-screen (save often, and keep multiple saves).  ALWAYS HAVE A DECKER IN YOUR CREW, ALWAYSALWAYSALWAYS, else you WILL miss out on ... things. It was a bigger deal in Returns but its still a thing here as well. I'd consider investing some decking skills and a datajack in your main character if not rolling as primarily a decker, the one provided for your crew has weak combat skills and generally has little use in combat other than using up health items, while you have a good healer, a tank, and a dps all available as free crewmembers from the outset; your mileage will vary though.\n\nSome of the user campaigns have made rattles across the internet, there's even a sandbox-esque mod available I believe.  anyway its a moot point now, if you haven't played a Shadowrun game and are interested...well, pick any of them, they're all good and all play/look roughly the same (Dragonfall is superior to Returns but in very small ways, Hong Kong obviously is the best looking so far).

I took just over 30 hours to complete this instalment but it was still pretty satisfying. My review here will comment on features as a standalone game as well as in comparison to Returns.\n\nPros\n\n1. Good characterization of NPCs, nice turn-based combat system, unique and interesting soundtrack.\n2. I think there's a wider variety of weapons here, including those that stun (guns and grenades)\n3. I like the artwork and the atmosphere of the game -- very post-apocalyptic and cyberpunk\n\nCons\n\n1. There are a few bugs -- sometimes things temporarily freeze in the Matrix; you can move the mouse but can't click anything. This is not a big deal, after a minute or so things return to normal.\n2. Inventory management hasn't changed since the first game, and can be pain when you'd like to distribute items to your fellow runners (you can't). It's not a bug but a design feature, so hopefully they'll change this in time.\n3. The storyline isn't really as compelling as Returns. There are some twists and turns but they aren't very natural and seem a little contrived. The German setting is interesting but future storylines could do with some improvement.\n\nTrue to Shadowrun, there is no voice acting. And there is a LOT of dialog. But I don't consider these Cons, just features that hearken back to classic RPG type days. Some like it, some don't, others are neutral.\n\nAll in all, this was still very satisfying to play (especially when your runner is equipped with a minigun!) and as long as HBS keeps producing 'em, I'll keep playing 'em.\n\n7.0/10","December 17, 2015","true","37.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It helps if you have previous knowledge of Shadowrun lore, but even still, I'm sure it would not disappoint if you're willing to put forth the effort and hear what everyone has to say.\n\nI feel like I know every character in the game personally.  Each one of them is very fleshed out and shines in their own particular way.  They are all so very unique and getting to know them throughout the game is a pleasure.  It feels like what you choose to say and how you say it truly makes a difference on your relationship with them.

The character development, both yourself and NPCs, the deep turn-based combat, the unique art style, the variety of the missions, the heavy choices with even heavier consequences, and the soundtrack.  All fantastic, but the writing is the true gem here.  I feel like I've just read a novel after finishing the game, and I believe it will stick with me for a very long time.\n\nI highly recommend Shadowrun: Dragonfall, and I will positively be purchasing Shadowrun: Hong Kong.

Dragonfall has a better story, better characters, better base, better UI, better length and better abilities. Having a team of repeat characters adds so much to the formula and makes the story matter so much more to a game full of side quests.\n\nAnyone who remotely enjoys turn based RPGs or has an interest in Shadowrun's cyberpunk/fantasy hybrid should strongly consider this game as their entry point for the series.

This is true, very true and underpins a fantastic game. Dragonfall is infinitely better than Shadowrun Returns to the point of making the original worthless. Dragonfall has a better story, better characters, better base, better UI, better length and better abilities. Having a team of repeat characters adds so much to the formula and makes the story matter so much more to a game full of side quests.\n\nAnyone who remotely enjoys turn based RPGs or has an interest in Shadowrun's cyberpunk/fantasy hybrid should strongly consider this game as their entry point for the series. If you play Returns first, you'll give up and miss out on an excellent game.

No matter how sad a character's fate is, its emotional impact is limited by how much the game can make you care about the character in the first place.\n\nDragonfall genuinely made me care about its characters (with the possible exception of, uh, what's his face, the rigger, he felt like an afterthought).  The gameplay is more polished than in Shadowrun Returns, but the story is just on an entirely different level.  The dialogue trees are engaging and full of surprises that play with genre conventions, the main storyline is intriguing, the loyalty mission chains are fascinating and occasionally heartwrenching, and basically I recommend the hell out of this game.","November 14, 2015","true","37.0"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

Because of this, most praise and criticism in my review of Shadowrun: Returns applies to this game as well.  This review will primarily focus on the changes.\n\nSome aspects of the design were improved.\n\nShadowrun: Dragonfall is less linear than Shadowrun: Returns, and most important decisions you make will affect the ending.\n\nSeveral new weapons and spells have been added.\n\nYou can now save at will, outside combat and conversations.\n\nOther aspects of the design are disappointing.\n\nI was hoping for more new weapons, spells, and armor, and perhaps other positive changes in the combat system (more statuses, called shots, a matrix that feels different from meatspace, etc.).\n\nMost music is reused from Shadowrun: Returns.  Yes, it was good.  Yes, some new tracks were added.  Yes, they are of similar quality.  It still feels disappointing.\n\nThe Bloodlines quest has an infuriating stealth segment.  Guards literally seem to have eyes in the back of their head, such that you will be spotted even if they are facing away from you, unless there is a wall in-between.  The guards patrol very quickly, making it hard to get past them in time, even when you know what needs to be done.  Worst of all, your train of companions cannot be directly controlled and will frequently get spotted.  This should have either been turn-based, with proper vision cones, or removed.\n\nThe developers have clearly favored a small number of possible builds for the main character and party.  Players without clairvoyance will be punished for deviating from the favored builds mid to late game.  Having to start over, after investing so much time, is likely to prevent many people from enjoying the game.\n\nSince you now have a large number of companions, you will want to play a build that is not redundant.  The only main character builds that are not redundant are adepts (still somewhat redundant due to Glory) and mages (recommended).\n\nYou better buy and keep any tasers you find, and any other action point damaging weapons or spells.  Be sure that most if not all party members (not just your main character) have a way to cause AP damage.  It will be almost impossible to win the final battle otherwise.","November 13, 2015","true","45.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

It is refreshing to see a developer that not only listens to the fans, but does something about their feedback! Even more impressive is their decision to give this version for free to those who already bought Dragonfall as an expansion.\n\nLike the original, Dragonfall serves up a big slice of isometric turn-based strategy fun set in the dystropian / utopian (strike based on your views) Shadowrun universe. Magic once again meets technology, and in the shadows of megacorporations people struggle to survive, or even thrive. The cast features very interesting characters, each with their own backstory and motivations. Also like the original, this is worth a replay for its story, though the story is larger and better in almost every way in Dragonfall.\n\nPro:\n*A stand-alone improvement on the expansion which was already an improvement on the original game.\n*A setting that never fails to engage, regardless of whether you hate or love the way the world has become in Shadowrun.\n*A developer that not only listens but actually acts upon feedback, and actively supports the community.\n*A community that releases new content using the game creation tools and assets that the developers released free of charge with the game.\n*The same exellent character portraits, with more thrown in!\n*Good, solid turn-based mechanics.\n*You can once again build your character's stats and abilities as you want them, or just use the pre-defined classes.\n\nCon:\n*Still only one campaign, though many more avaliable through the community. Dare we hope for an expansion to this, or better yet, a sandbox mode?\n*While the in-game models have gotten some new hairstyles, they still clash a bit with the exellent character portraits (especially for the orcs and trolls).\n\nSummary:\nThis is an improvement in almost every way. If you own the original and liked it, this is for you. If you like classic isometric TBS games, this is for you. If you like the Shadowrun universe, this is for you. If the idea of cyberpunk or a setting that mixes fantasy and sci-fi, this is for you. While it may not be perfect, it is very, very good at what it does. 8/10 -Recomended!\n\nFor more recomendations and reviews: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/strandedkerbonaut#curation","October 2, 2014","true","33.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

However, I imagine they are similar enough to write a reasonably accurate review.\n\nIn short, this is one of the best modern day RPG's. A fantastic story, amazing turn-based combat system, great characters and real Shadowrun-atmosphere unlike in the original Dead Man's Switch campaign (here you actually do runs against different corporations and other enemy factions, many of them are optional). In the basegame (Dead Man's Switch), maps are linear and your character skills and stats are not utilized enough in dialogue, but in Dragonfall, both have been addressed incredibly well. There is also a nice variety of character interaction and optional side quests (you know, REAL side quests, not like thos in Dead Man's Switch).\n\nIn many ways, this game reminds me of the games from the golden age of Bioware: Baldur's Gate, Neverwinter Nights, Knights of the Old Republic and Jade Empire. It has similarly deep characters with interesting backstories and well thought-out story. But the setting here in the Shadowrun universe brings one unique spice to the mix: the morality is not as bland and dated as good vs. evil, but rather Witcher-like shades of gray.\n\nThen we have the epilogue section, which, while short, fills in some background information and specifics about the story and leaves the player off with an exceptionally satisfying solution - or solutions, there are choices that matter in the game!\n\nCouple words of criticism, though... While Dragonfall improves many aspects from the original Dead Man's Switch campaign, like adding a proper save system, side-quests, characters, shadowruns and story, the Matrix part is still just another combat system with little to no variety or difference to the "real world" combat. Luckily, there are now almost no compulsory hacking sections, so, while a bit dissappointed, I don't think this is a big deal. If you are looking for a Shadowrun game with an interesting hacking system, try the SEGA Genesis version of Shadowrun instead.\n\nShort story short: buy it, play it! If there is even a chance that you might enjoy a good old-stylish RPG mixed with modern day UI and mechanics or turn-based tactical combat game similar to XCOM:EU, I am almost certain you are going to enjoy this one thoroughly. To me, it left such a deep impression that I just can't put into words. I used to play the SEGA Genesis version of Shadowrun, and before I played this, it was hands-down the best implementation of the classic tabletop RPG. Now it has been dethroned by Dragonfall, easily.\n\n9/10, an instant classic and underappreciated RPG.

It has all the big warning signs of something that is also on mobile devices. But it's functional. Mostly.\n\nStorywise it's pretty good, you have a 4 person team with in depth background stories, including story related missions.

A must have!\n\nNot only the gameplay is wonderful (expanded with many more options like grenade launchers and even throwing knives!), but also the plot; it's amazingly well-written, and the characters are very deep and captivating. Now instead of hiring runners for each job, you get a full permanent party! <3\n\nI have absolutely no words to describe the utterly delightful experience of playing such an amazing game.\n\nThe overall playing experience is wonderful - the ambience in Berlin, the wide array of skills, weapons and cyberware you have access to, the introduction of a permanent-yet-optional party instead of only mercenaries to go with you on missions, the WONDERFUL artwork and the classless system makes this rank as the best tactical RPG I ever played, tied with Final Fantasy Tactics (and believe me, coming from a old school Squaresoft fan, that's a lot).\n\nThe psychological depth of the characters introduced in this game is lovely. From your party to the town NPCs to the people you meet throughout the game, all characters are richly constructed, to the extent that they feel _alive_ to the player. They have emotions; they laugh, they cry, they have a story.

The improvements to the UI, combat system, and NPC growth are welcome additions, as well as the story being a much better tale than DeadMan's Switch, the campaign from vanilla Shadowrun Returns.\n\nPros:\n\nAll the good stuff about Shadowrun Returns is here and some improvements.  The UI is better, especially with options to upscale text size, which is great for guys like me that play my pc games on a big HDTV.\n\nYour team members also have individual levelling trees, which is great.  You have a little bit of control over their development.\n\nCons:\n\nThe environment is still a pain to navigate in when you hit a tight corner.  Often I try to move behind a crate only to missclick and end up walking around it to the wrong side, wasting action points.\n\nI'd like to see a better customization option for your team runners.  Ideally a total custom team building option, or at least class selection for them, because if I'm a decker, then I don't need a decker, that sort of thing, and some guy just sits around being useless.\n\nI may also be remembering this wrong, but I think the only team members you can choose abilities for are the core group, none of the hireable runners you can pick up, which makes those ones useless, because your teammembers will outpower them.\n\nJust a few nitpicks, it's a good game overall for people into turn based RPG's and that love that old school feel.\n\nAlso, still gets a ++ in my book for being the only Shadowrun (digital) game with full selection of whatever race you want to play as to start.

The game skips out on the world law however so you might want to pop over to the Shadowrun wiki before you do just to work out why orcs are shooting mages with cyber guns.\n\nIts a fun tactical rpg with combat close to the most recent x-com - enemy unknown game. Position, cover and abilities all will need to be used to be successful. My 1st run through took about 20+ hours with most of the side mission though it was buggy in some places (mostly scrolling round during matrix runs).\n\nStoryline was good but not great for me - I went in as a Orc Street Samurai (big guns) and a lot of the game felt like they would have really preferred it if I had played a decker or a mage. However the character creation system is very flexible and it certainly warrants a second play.\n\nIf you like cyber punk, combat RPGs and interesting settings I would recommend this one for you.","January 9, 2015","true","23.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

And for the most part they share the same core mechanics, with Dragonfall having a few improvements to UI, party management, and overall level design. So if you didn't like Returns, than you are not going to like Dragonfall either.  On the other hand, if you only kind of enjoy Returns, or thought it was below average than you'll enjoy Dragonfall due to  its improvements.\n\nDragonfall has a lot of the same things going for it that Returns had too. The story is a compelling tale of revenge with numerous subplots and character development. All of which is told through a lot of reading. The characters in your group and in the game's world have their own goals, personalities, and abilities.  All of which makes them feel more realistic and relatable. Lastly specialization matters in the game since there are numerous options in the game's environment and dialogue that can only be access by a character proficient in a certain skill or talent. And while some might look negatively on this as limiting gameplay, I found it to be a positive since it made character development feel like it matter beyond just picking combat skills.\n\nDragonfall has a few things going against it, most of which were also in Returns. The game's camera has an isometric view that cannot be rotated, which limits what the user can see and how levels are design. And while this fits into their desire art style, that art style is kind of bad. There isn't a lot of detail being displayed, and most objects/npcs are unremarkable. This also affects the next problem which is the production value for the game. There is a lot of reading, and I mean a lot, like a hundred of pages of text. And for most of the game this is fine, but where I take exception to it is during important scenes like the ending. The lack of voice overs, and cut scenes during these important story segments makes the game feel cheap, and the scenes lack effectiveness.  It is the lack of effort on this mechanic that irritates me, I mean Fallout 2 (which came out in 1998) had cut-scenes, which were just a slide show with a voice over. So it wouldn't be difficult for them to do something similar if they wanted to. Lastly, I encounter a rather nasty bug in the game that I feel the need to pointed out, since it is seems to be common, and it is major. Near the end of the game, at numerous occasions, I lost the ability to move or command my characters. And as you can guess, this was game breaking. The only recover I found was to reload a manual save file. I don't think having an issue like this is acceptable, especially in a title that has been out for a while.\n\nLike I said at the top, Dragonfall isn't going to change your opinion on the Shadowrun series if you had a negative view of it before. But if you liked it or had mixed feelings about it than it might. It takes what worked in Returns and does them better.","January 9, 2015","true","33.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The story was too fast to develop any relationhip with other characters so I couldnt feel motivation. And the story was just mission to mission without any break or sensible interaction in between. Not what I would expect from Shadowrun, p'n'p RPG or any true RPG (it is horrible how any game where one can put points to atributes is labbeled as "RPG").\n\n\nHowever, Dragonfall is totally different. Although number of missions are still small, you can chose their order (at least), they resemble standard shadowrun "runs" and quite often you are put in situation which are in grey area of morality or even quite black from every possible angle. This together with quite a lot of different solutions based on skills, be it hacking terminal to get 250 credits to geting the right answer with that high charisma to get through mission without firing a shot, makes SR:D quite a nice thing to roleplay and adds quite a bit to replayability.\n\n\nThe story is also much better, it develops slowly, there are quite a lot of hints and player has the opportunity to get known his party in much greater detail. With Director's Cut, this is greatly expanded not only by expanded development of party members, but with their new personal quests and special abilities from them.\n\n\nIf the original SR:R would have looked like this, it would be much better. On top that, steam workshop full of player-made stories gives quite a lot of additional hours after you finish dragonfall.

The combat is well thought out, the writing would be excellent on the scale of a novel, nevermind a video game, and it truly captures the greyscale morality of Shadowrun.\n\nAnd then... the Director's Cut came along.  All that greyscale goodness is intensified with more missions, more choices, and more decisions where you don't make the "good" choice, you make the choice you can live with.  Special mention goes to The Lodge which has been significantly expanded (and feels far more dire now) but also several character development elements now bring rewards ALA Planescape: Torment.\n\nPlus you can finally have a little more control over your team mates' development.  They'll always be weaker than a good build but now they're more rounded they don't have to depend on your player quite so much.\n\nA must-have for the mature RPG player who wants real meat and isn't afraid to do some old school reading yet still wants some beautiful artwork and excellent music to go along with it.","June 15, 2015","true","39.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It's fairly text-heavy, the graphics are pretty basic, some of the areas start to look the same, the world has limited interactivity beyond objects immediately relevant to the plot, there are a number of little glitches--and yet, in spite of these drawbacks I've logged about 100 hours in cyberpunk dystopian Berlin.\n\nThe variety of character classes is one of the biggest draws for me, plus the fact that you can actually play a couple of truly viable hybrid classes. I played a Shaman on my first playthrough (steep learning curve, there) and a Decker/Rigger on my second.  The different skill trees and 'etiquette' functions are incorporated nicely into the dialogue and story options, so that based on your character's configuration, you will have to come up with different problem-solving techniques for various hurdles.\n\nMonika is written as a bit of a MarySue, but the other party members have wit and interesting back stories.

It is also a different approach to the linear, minimalistic design of Shadowrun Returns, all thanks to the development behind the magic which clearly listened to its community. By this, in my book, Herebrained Schemes has proved themselves as one of the open and progressive development teams in the industry. - Which, undisputably, rocks.\n\nShadowrun: Dragonfall, starts with a simple enough campaign introduction which includes a small group of Shadowrunners doing their everyday job. As they, along with our protagonist, proceed deep into this twisted, mysterious job, they face a plot twist that shakes the foundation of their own perspective of the world and history. - Therefore, the Dragonfall Campaign starts as our heroes fight against a great set of conspiracies and problems regarding their community, as well as their personal nightmares that were haunting each and every one of their pasts. Needless to say, our heroes are scarred but resistant team of excellent runners from different backgrounds.\n\nRemember, Side Quests and enviromental details that are being presented within optional storylines are the ones that makes a roleplaying game; a live, breathing world.\n\nIf you aren't familiar with the Shadowrun brand itself and/or would like to try out a turn-based roleplaying game like this, I strongly recommend you to start from Shadowrun Returns and proceed to Dragonfall campaign. Only then, you will agree with my opinion that this franchise and this development is worth following and supporting.\n\nWould you like to know something that also rocks? - It runs on GNU/Linux.

My con list might seem quite large but they're all pretty minor.\n\nPros\nFeels like Shadowrun quite well - the detail in the world is very Shadowrun\nVery good story/stories (depending on how you go through the game)\nSimple Skill system - takes a while for you to work out, but in the end.\nTurn based solution with pretty good UI that's quick to pick up.\nHacking UI is pretty good as well, quite interesting but too easy.\nCons\nSkill system too simple in the end.\nPoor help, ie finding out what a point of Essence loss does to an Adept.\nLack of real gear to choose from.\nNo training mission that can teach you how to use your drugs/reload/cooldowns.\nToo much text to read at times, slows the game right down.\nUnable to equip your team with other weapons/gear.All in all worth playing folks, took me around 19.4 hours to finish it all (and I did all I think)\n\nThe graphics aren't great but don't take away the shine from the game.

(Hah, like I'm capable of short reviews...)\n\nWell, I can simply say that this is one of the best RPGs I have played in a long while. It's in a very cyber-punk future Earth, where metahumans (elf, troll, ork, dwarf) exist alongside humans.\n\nYou start off this incredibly well-written story by choosing your gender, then race, and finally your class (which you are not limited to, by any means.. you can be a mage/decker mix if you'd like).\n\nThe classes are as follows:\n\nDeckers - Futuristic hackers capable of entering the "Matrix" to take control of turrets/cameras/doors or steal data (wherein you fight programs to get at important nodes containing access).\n\nRigger - (No I'm not yelling a racial slur.) "Jack" into your personal drone(s) to get a powerful ally that will fight alongside you, slip into small openings and vents to ambush enemies or unlock doors, and essentially have full control of any robot or turret that you can reach to turn the battlefield in your favor (I beat the game first with this and it was a lot of fun, as well as much easier than I felt being a Decker was, I regret not dipping into both at once).\n\nStreet Samurai - Basic combat class. Can be talented with melee weapons or guns or both.\n\nMage/Adept - Cast spells or channel magic into your fists to enhance or debilitate combatants.\n\nShaman - Summon spirits to fight for you either by using various summoning spots (located conveniently in most battlefields) or special fetishes bought and kept in your inventory for immediate use. Beware, though... while they are incredibly powerful, they are not as loyal as drones and may break free and attack whoever they please.\n\nAll of the combat in the game is turn-based. When an enemy knows where you are, gets too close, or you set off an alarm, your entire team of 4 (or more depending on if you have drones or temporary/neutral companions) stops dead in its tracks and you spend AP to move. 2 AP is the basic start and I've only ever had at most 3 on my Rigger and 3 on my two drones (so basically 7 total attacks, since having a drone active reduces your AP by one per) by the end of the main story.\n\nThe combat works well and the cover system, while still leaving you a bit vulnerable no matter what you're hiding behind, isn't unfair.\n\nAside from that, I just have to restate my love for this story. I won't spoil even the smallest detail, but I will say that you encounter a conspiracy and while it is not the only aspect your team will focus on, it is their main focus. You will do a ton of odd jobs as a Shadow Runner and test your skills and morality along the way.\n\nWatch even one gameplay video and if it looks like you could enjoy it, get the game. That's all I can say about it, because the story speaks for itself. I fully intend to try the other Shadowrun games, even if they aren't as good and I hope anyone reading this decides to do the same.","March 18","true","40.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

That's a tribute to the talented wordsmith ( writer ) and the artists that designed the portraits. I ended up developing a crush on two characters.\n\nI would have liked a proper introduction, since I found the lore quite jarring ( cyberpunk meets fantasy ) and it got more surreal, as the plot evolved. It would have helped me to make different endgame choices ( I feel like I failed at the end ). I've never played the pen and paper game or the first Shadowrun game: "Dead Man's Switch".\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadowrun#Fictional_universe\n\nThe classes have everything from the traditional, offensive, elemental mage and healer to the more exotic: William Gibson style hacker, who runs through "The Matrix" like Neo; Rigger who fixes drones and uses them as pets in combat; Samurai sword wielders that go around slicing people's heads off; Empty-handed melee combatants, that channel Chi energy.\n\nThe game has a couple of references to movies like, "The Terminator" and "The Sound of Music", so it would help to have watched those.\n\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088247/\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0059742/\n\n"Du Heist" is my favourite piece of music in the game.

After nearly 2 decades of waiting for a worthy successor to Jake Armitage's original mission, Harebrained Schemes pulls the rabbit out of the hat, only to find that its made of gemstone-encrusted gold.\n\nDragonfall is a fantastic tactical turn-based RPG with a great score and a storyline which will have you guessing until the end- and even then nothing is guaranteed without your own personal influence. I and my roommate both played the game through, and even though the main plot remained the same, the paths we chose and the outcome of the story based on those decisions wound up to be two completely different scenarios. With the amount of decisions that become available to you throughout the 30-ish missions depending on your stats, class, etiquette, race, ETC...this is a game with a LOT of replay value.\n\nIf you loved 'Shadowrun Returns', do yourself a favor and pick up Dragonfall- it makes 'Returns' look like a beta in regards to how much is offered as far as gameplay is concerned. If youve never played Shadowrun before, I can only describe it as "Blade Runner" meets "Lord of the Rings". How cool of a concept is that alone??\n\nThere are few things to gripe about in this game, but here are the things which I would like to see fixed:\n\n-When you find an item you are allowed to send it to your stash (which is only accessible pre-round) or swap it with something in your inventory. However, when you hover over your inventory, no popup appears, telling you what that item is- and until youre familiar with the item icons it can be tough to judge what to keep and what to swap.\n\n-Similarly, when you find an item, you cannot give it to a fellow teammate, even if they have inventory room...kinda sucks to find a really good grenade and then have to decide whether to swap it for one of the 5 items you can carry to battle, or just ignore it til next round because you cant offer it to someone else.\n\n-Sometimes, AOE (area of effect) attacks will not display the targetting ring at the feet of target until you cancel the move and re-select it.\n\n-While shifting between the Matrix and "meatspace", the music will sometimes bug out and play the wrong track, or simply stop altogether.\n\nSmall complaints, but its hard to find faults in such a great game. Dragonfall delivers a package more solid than John Holmes...I cant wait to see what theyre doing with "Hong Kong".

Dragonfall is an improvement in every way over Shadowrun Returns’ original campaign of Dead Man’s Switch and the directors cut improves the game even further.\n\nUnlike many modern RPGs, Dragonfall can be played and completed in a number of different role-playing ways.  A typical mission may offer the options to go in guns blazing, to diplomatically talk your way to your goal, to bribe an NPC for information on a side door in that is less guarded, or to strong arm that NPC into giving you that info for free.\n\nThe writing is excellent.  Many of the missions are more than what they seem to be at first and can often be resolved in ways that are unexpected.  Your choices have an effect and can change not only the way that missions are completed, but the ending as well.\n\nThe companions are well fleshed out and memorable, each with their own personality.

The character building is robust without being confusing and the storyline and world-building are excellent, but the real star is the X-Com-style combat system. Keep in mind that this isn't necessarily a huge open-world sandbox like some of the others I mentioned (which is not a bad thing) but rather a more focused, semi-linear experience, akin to a RPG module or campaign. I have yet to play the original game but the general concensus is that this stand-alone sequel/ expansion is the superior of the two.","December 7, 2014","true","5.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The npc vendors don't just sell you med kits, they have stories and dialogue trees that change as the plot progresses. The game systems are all integrated with the story, so immersion doesn't get sacrificed.\nFlexible party system. Your 3-4 main npc companions can be supplimented by mercenary runners, allowing your main character to really be any skill-set without endangering your ability to complete missions. The companions each have their utility, often times being able to "step in" and help your character solve puzzles or negotiate.\nAs a follow up to the above, your main character has a lot of customization options, as you grow in power you get to specialize or spread out your skills and attributes. Even going into the end of the game the choice of what skill to increase next was always a difficult trade-off. Unlike typical crpgs, your statistics like HP, damage and accuracy do not automatically improve as you advance, you have to allocate your points towards those goals. This lets you be well rounded or neglect area in order to specialize in others, depending on your play style.\nBattle difficulty is balanced by in-game choices. The truly difficult fights in the game are often avoidable, and the ones you are forced to engage in typically have alternate win conditions besides wiping out the enemy force. Even the toughest fights will have environmental aids in the form of bonus party memebers or interactable battlefield (targetable explosive barrels, enemy factions that will fight each other if you lead them into each other, etc).\nDialogue and Diplomacy can play a huge part in your story, if you so choose. Conversations with important npcs have a *lot* of branches, some of which appear after interacting with the environment (reading a journal or e-mail) or having the proper skill. Your companions open up to conversation based on in-game events, giving the progression a very organic feel. Charisma gives the option of unlocking "Etiquette" traits chosen as you raise it, instead of just being a number. Every few points of Charisma allow you to choose an Etiquette specialization (Academic, Corporate, Street, etc), which allows the game to provide diplomatic options without letting a charming PC bypass everything. Most major encounters have a diplomatic option, but you can't have enough Etiquettes to charm everyone. This way even the dumb thug PC can be versed in gang etiquette without having to become silver-tongued, which is a nice alternative to the traditional "low int/cha pc must kill everything" default.\nDragonfall's main flaws are in my opinion:\nPoor inventory system, you cannot trade items with party members in the middle of a mission. This gets annoying because your main character can only carry a few items, so you end up finding grenades, guns and stims that you can't pass to your party members till after the mission has ended. This will be changed in the next Shadowrun game according to their kickstarter.\nThe isometric camera angle can obscure targets sometimes, forcing you to play "find the pixel" when multiple characters are adjacent and overlapping their models.\nSome noticable bugs (especially in the cyberspace segments). Things like disappearing enemy health bars. I didn't experience anything game-breaking but I did have one instance where my character was able to jack into the Matrix (the cyberspace world) twice at once.\nDecking/Matrix battles suffer from being really repetitive after the first couple times you jack-in. Like the Fade sequences in the Dragon Age series, the Matrix wears out it's fun. One fun part of some missions is having a decker jacked in to the system while the rest of your team are fighting, so you play 3 matrix turns for every 1 "meatspace" turn. Eventually I found the matrix portions to be boring, and longed to get them over with in order to return to the rest of the game. By the second half of the game the meatspace battles have many variables and strategies to try but the matrix mechanics never really evolve. Just as you get different gear, spells and abilities as you progress in the game, you gain "programs" for use in cyber warfare, but instead of getting more interesting the numbers just get bigger. Fortunately almost all the decking in the game is optional or has optional components.\nBesides those specifics, Dragonfall has good game mechaics and an excellent story. The turn-based combat system feels like a clean combination of Fallout and XCOM. The graphics are beautiful, especially the character portraits and scenery. The music and ambient sound are both top-notch, I usually listen to other music when gaming but the soundtrack here adds greatly to immersion. Despite its flaws I recommend Shadowrun Dragonfall to any fan of CRPGs and Cyberpunk.","February 11, 2015","true","28.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

That's a tribute to the talented wordsmith ( writer ) and the artists that designed the portraits. I ended up developing a crush on two characters.\n\nI would have liked a proper introduction, since I found the lore quite jarring ( cyberpunk meets fantasy ) and it got more surreal, as the plot evolved. It would have helped me to make different endgame choices ( I feel like I failed at the end ). I've never played the pen and paper game or the first Shadowrun game: "Dead Man's Switch".\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadowrun#Fictional_universe\n\nThe classes have everything from the traditional, offensive, elemental mage and healer to the more exotic: William Gibson style hacker, who runs through "The Matrix" like Neo; Rigger who fixes drones and uses them as pets in combat; Samurai sword wielders that go around slicing people's heads off; Empty-handed melee combatants, that channel Chi energy.\n\nThe game has a couple of references to movies like, "The Terminator" and "The Sound of Music", so it would help to have watched those.\n\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088247/\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0059742/\n\n"Du Heist" is my favourite piece of music in the game. The scene is a late night bank heist / data transfer, while rifling through papers, searching for clues and missing links:\n\nhttps://soundcloud.com/everistsound/shadowrun-dragonfall-directors-cut-ost-du-heist-blitzs-mission\n\nIt took me 66 hours to finish the game on "hard". I loved the tactical combat and plan on re-playing the game another 4 times, to experience other classes.\n\nI give this game 9/10, deducting a point for the lack of ability to rotate the map in combat, the lack of a dedicated "move" button and the cumbersome inventory that obviously needs redesigning.\n\nIn 30 years of gaming, this might be # 5 on my list of "Best Games of All Time"...","December 28, 2014","true","72.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Okay, you can get both if you want to support the Davs, but this right here is the definite version of the Dragonfall campaign.\n\nI even consider this the better of the 2 given story campaigns, due to. Well. I'll come to this later\n\nsowhat to tell you about it? Its the Shadowrun system in all its goodness and Shine! The Story takes place in the Flux State of Berlin, Germany in a Kiez (a word usually used to describe a neighborhood, kinda like the word "hood" in english) named Kreuzbasar in the Happiest place on Earth - Kreuzberg.\n\nand a lot of the Story can be described as "It was a simple job, no way it could fail - and then stuff got worse" but that theme is done so well, the story grips you from the get-go and never lets you free again.\n\nNow, heres why I find this campaign better than Dead Mans Switch - You are given a Team. people you work with, that get a backstory, a personality. Sure, DMS gives you that shaman and battle mage from the beginning, but those are only slightly covered in the Story.\nYour team gives that story Life, it feels more vivid, more  like you are the Leader of not some rolled together bunch of runners, but the leader of a well oiled team.\nbut then again, the story pretty quickly makes you the leader of the team, so yeah. you are pretty much stuck with them\n\nNow, you may ask "Why shouldnt I just buy the Dragonfall DLC for Shadowrun returns?" I tell you why: This version is spruced up the Butt with special features. For starters the "Level System" for the aforementioned crew. After certain waypoints you can choose one of two permanent perk for each memeber. From extra equipment, active and passive abilities to better weapons. and sometimes you are just stuck between a rock and a hard place with your decision! get an active ability that reloads all your weapons for no cost or fet 2 sniper shots (high damage and pretty good crit chance) out for the price of one?\nThen there is the matter of a few extra missions, one for a Sidequest fraction, The Lodge, and one for every of your teammates (deepening their story even more and giving you a good feeling of closure)\nOh, and the character Missions end up giving you a permanent upgrade for the character in Question\n\nOf course, it comes with all the upgrasdes of the original DLC version, such as ore spells, more weapons and weapon types.\n\nThe game itself, due to its pretty free character creation system, has a lot of replay value. just to try out different approaches. The fact that you arent retricted in your character creations lets yourself be open for a ton of different crazy  multiclassing options. Workshop Content is worked on heavily and the User Made campaigns are fun to play.\nThe Editor program is easy to handle and with a good Idea you may want to make your own.\n\ncombat by itself is still the tactical way, a lot like XCOM (2012), Your units gain a number of actions a turn and you use them to move around, use abilities, Items or just lay waste to the enemies. You can take cover to increase your chances of not ening up as a bloody mess on the roadside (or as an adept, just say "Screw that" and use your spell that gives you different srengths of cover for a few turns)\n\nOh, and if you skill yourself right you will endu up fighing  Basilisks and mini-Dragons by funching them in the face.

So then went with a troll street samurai which was much better to play.\n\nThis game I feel could be better. 5/10 ok but nothing amazing, it feels like an indie game, it's lacking a certain something. Gameplay is rather tedious and meh. The turn based system is so rng, even on easy it can feel overwhelming.\n\nOnce I got to Apex and destroyed it, I experienced a game breaking bug of not being able to move, though I could hear the music still playing and reloading the last autosave just results in a black screen and for some reason my quick save is no longer there.\n\nMy only option is to restart this rather lengthy mission from the begining and how do I know if the same bug wont happen again?\n\nCan't reccomend because of this game breaking bug which despite it happening to a lot of people never gets fixed.

Just flat out, god awful and uninspired. Returns blows. Dragonfall blows. Hong Kong (from what I've researched), still blows because it has all of the problems but doesn't fix any of the fundamental issues.\n\nYes, the dialogue can be decent at points, even inspired, but it's never worth the time you have to invest. Especially when the story plods along and places you in situations where, in a real game, these would just be side quests and not forced on you to interact with people you don't care about.\n\nThese games were clearly made with mobile phones in mind, from the game design itself and how the shadow runs work, to the small areas that lead to loading time after loading time. From the menus and the big highlighted baubles meant for fingers, that also end up detracting from true exploration and make the games feel even more linear than they already are (thanks in part to design that makes it so you can't backtrack to previous areas unless mandated so by the story).\n\nThe combat lacks that visceral quality games like Fallout 1 & 2 had and just never hits that stride of "fun" that a good game should, especially when you don't have a proper loot system because the developers thought it would be "too hard" to implement.\n\nNot to mention the world is far too static. In good CRPGs, the world was meant to react to your actions. Whether you stole things or killed someone, they responded well to player ingenuity and spontaneity. Instead, this game only allows for limited choices because the game is far too story heavy and doesn't want you breaking the content. If you don't like someone, you can't get rid of them until the story says you can. I want to play an RPG, not a visual novel.\n\nOh and don't be surprised that nobodies made anything worthwhile with the editor - people would have to ENJOY playing it to want to make more content.\n\nNearly twenty years ago, two separate companies took a stab at making the definitive Shadowrun experience for the respective Super Nintendo and SEGA Genesis. What's amazing about those titles is that despite the quirks that stem from releasing an RPG on a console, they hold up and are still debated amongst gamers as to which is truly the best game - and I have no doubts that the debate will continue to rage on, but I have serious doubts that the same would ever happen to this trilogy of trash.\n\nEven if you're starved for a modern RPG that doesn't suck, you will not find that here.

The camera can zoom in closer and show me the expression on someone's face, if not, change the picture to mimic what the text is saying.\n\nAlso the characters should make body movements along with the text.

Old school style RPG similar to Baldur's Gate which is always a good thing. The story is really good and thought-provoking. I enjoyed reading the dialog and backstory as it really dropped you right into the Shadowrun world. The way your team remembers the choices you make and react accordingly is also a nice touch. Great XCOM-style turn based combat, although too many attacks seem to miss for some reason. Dragonfall is definitely worth buying for any RPG fans.\n\n+ Immersive, well-written story\n+ Different ways of achieving objectives\n+ Interesting and complex characters\n\n- Not much in the way of exploration\n- No customization of fellow runners\n- Decker matrix sequences are pretty boring\n\nHighly recommended and one of the best RPG's I've played for a while.","December 2, 2014","true","19.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The pacing in both campaigns is a bit odd at times (IMO), and there are some balance issues around some of the magic (adepts are a bit weak without someone to throw haste at them, healing spells are weird), but they're engrossing nonetheless, and the gameplay feels like a tabletop without being clunky.\n\nOverall, it's my top find for 2014, and I HIGHLY encourage anyone reading this to pick it up.

The combat has a "feel" to it that's pretty similar to X-Com, if you're already familiar with that. Crunchy and satisfying - player skill is definitely a major component. There's occasionally some space made (and even sometimes bonus karma - the game's XP equivalent) for non-violent problem solving too, which is appreciated. The non-violent options are almost always dialogue-based, though. Stealth is very rarely an option.\n\nThe world-building, characterization, and storytelling are all solid too. The production values are a little labor-of-love at times, though - for instance, there's zero voice-acting, so actually experiencing that world-building, etc. is definitely an "I hope you like text" experience. If you can get past that, however, you're gonna find you got a lot of bang for your buck. The Shadowrun setting is a fascinating cyberpunk-meets-D&D blend, and, as alluded to, the characters are well-drawn and engaging. The shaman who used to be front man for a punk rock band is a good example. The setting - a kind of anarchist polity called the Berlin Flux State - is another one. One last thing I liked - while what happens in the story is definitely very important to you and the region you live in, it's not yet another messianic save-the-world quest. Think more Fallout: New Vegas in terms of the stakes of the story. There are multiple endings based on what you choose at the end (and to a lesser extent earlier in the story) available as well. That said, I would have enjoyed a wrap-up that included more by way of showing the ramifications of your choices, as well as a bit more of a branching narrative based on earlier choices.\n\nBasically, if you want to see what X-Com combat would look like in a story-driven CRPG with a very unique setting, this is going to be a very strong "would recommend" game.","November 30, 2014","true","38.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I love the world, I love the character classes, I love the music, I love the stories, I love the game play, I love everything about it. I did not think it could get any better, but I definitely wanted more of it.\n\nShadowrun: Dragonfall gave me everything I wanted and more: it is more Shadowrun, and it actually improves on an already perfect model.

I spent hours building up my character and acquiring skills, and yet I'm forced to drop it for Dragonfall. That hurts a little. But it's a minor complaint because, admittedly, it's a new game and with a new game you get a new character. So be it.\n\nOtherwise, as I have said, this game is perfect. It is cyberpunk done right (and this from a guy who can't stand Snowcrash or other "classic" cyberpunk landmarks), and maybe more importantly, it's RPG done right.\n\nHarebrained Schemes should be proud, and I commend them for bringing this masterpiece to Linux.","October 27, 2014","true","64.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Dead Man's Switch was an introductory campaign to the setting and the style of the game, but I never felt like it was complete, somehow. It dissuaded me from playing Dragonfall, but my friend bought it for me and after a long period of absence I decided it was time to wipe away the expectations and dive right back into the setting.\n\nDragonfall doesn't disappoint. I know it's a personal point on my end, but I really enjoyed the setting in Berlin, Germany over Seattle, UCAS. The world changes in the Shadowrun universe and even the United States (and by extension Canada) aren't the same, I know. But the endless slog through 'murica kind of gets old after a while.\n\nThe campaign sets up the mystery expertly and eases you into the bigger picture, feeding you just enough to keep you interested. As a relatively seasoned game master for multiple sessions across multiple systems, it was really enjoyable to be a player in a masterwork. The ending really feels like a summation of all you've done, all the loose ends gathered into one single point that asks one extremely probing question that might change the way you think about yourself, or develop the character you're playing.\n\nCombat is solid enough, for what it is. In Dead Man's Switch it felt a lot more unbalanced and like I kept getting killed at unfair points (unsure if this is because I was a Decker or not--felt like the game was punishing me for not being a street samurai). Which could just be entirely my experience. Dragonfall I played a street samurai thug with a heart of gold (aka high charisma) and it felt like my team member choices were more important, because they both had story things to offer me as well as combat advantages that changed the nature of battle. I will admit to playing favourites, though.\n\nAll in all, I really like Dragonfall, and regret misjudging the Shadowrun setting for years. The game sparked me and some friends to make a group, and we're going to be playing the tabletop version. Please support this project, and these devs. We need more guys like this writing and creating games.","November 17, 2014","true","38.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

What I love about the Shadowrun universe is that it takes the tired old fantasy theme/races and mixes it up with (in my opinion) the much more interesting cyberpunk setting.\n\nAs well as the main plot that kept me hooked I also enjoyed exploring the backstories and quests of your Shadow runner team mates, most notably Glory's which was very well done.\n\nThe soundtrack is fantastic and really sets the mood for each scene, glad the directors cut comes with a copy of the soundtrack. *Transfers to MP3 player*\n\nThe only thing I would improve upon is the customization and progression of your team mates who will only go up six levels at fixed points in the game with only a choice of two skills for each. I did come across a few bugs which made me have to re-try some quests but I know the devs are still actively patching the game so this is forgiveable.\n\nOverall I highly recommend this to anyone who's looking for a good story with interesting characters and likes old school turned based RPG's with an entirely text-based narrative.","December 9, 2014","true","26.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kruncheez/recommended/300550/","Kruncheez","Kruncheez","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kruncheez/","215 products in account","Shadowrun: Dragonfall takes place in the not-too-distant future of Berlin, Germany. The Awakening has brought magic back to the world, and with it, new races of metahuman (Elves, orcs, trolls, and more). You play as a shadowrunner, which is essentially a professional mercenary in high demand. You and your crew are contracted to complete various jobs for respectable pay, many of which are morally questionable. The plot of the game revolves around a run gone wrong, after which your crew discovers that something big and bad is rising up from forgotten history, and it wants to take you out, even if that means destroying all of Berlin.\n\nThe game gives you control of your four-man squad as you complete your contracts and slowly discover more about the over-arching plot. The game is very dialogue heavy and requires a lot of reading as there is no actual voice acting. The game world is full of both futuristic tech and magic, with The Matrix (a simulated computer world where missions and combat actually take place) being a prominent focus. The characters have unique personalities and intriguing backstories that you learn about over time, but only if you ask the right questions. Combat is turn-based, with Action Points determining how far you can move and attack in a turn. Whether an attack hits or not is based on a percentage chance, which is affected by distance, amount of cover, and the attacking ability (which can be magic, guns, throwing weapons, melee weapons, grenades, etc.). Combat is similar to XCOM: Enemy Unknown, for those that have played that.\n\nLeveling up isn't as simple as gaining experience points from fights. Instead, you earn Karma, which is received for completing missions and passing certain skill checks. There are the standard RPG qualities - Strength, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, Quickness, Body - but also subcategories of each, like Decking, which dictates how good your character is at interacting with computers and The Matrix. These abilities are useful both in combat and out of combat, as certain proficiencies can unlock hidden dialogue options that allow situations to be resolved quicker and with better rewards.\n\nOverall, the game has a fascinating story, an immersive in-game world, and enjoyable combat. Very little to complain about, though repeated playthroughs do lack that intense sense of intrigue that goes along with learning more about the world, your crew, and the main plot. Highly recommended for RPG fans.","January 11, 2015","true","24.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

And the results were amazing.\n\nShadowrun: Dragonfall is insanely impressive. The writing is intricate, detailed, and full of the world building goodness that makes you loveling remember games like Planescape: Torment or Baldur's Gate. You build a character from a blank slate, using a class system that is both manageable and flexible, allowing, for example, your Hacker class character to learn magic from the get-go, if  you so choose. And then the world unfurls around you, replete with body modifications, A.I.s, hackers, urban sprawl, street drugs, meta-humans, ghosts-in-the-machine and so much more.\n\nThe graphics aren't jaw-dropping, but the environment and combat effects blend to create a great atmosphere and tone for the game. The combat is easy to pick up, essentially being a turn based tactical battle system where each character uses a pool of AP to move and attack. What's impressive about the combat is how organic it feels. The majority of your NPC companions start out with guns, and yet the turn-based system makes aiming, reloading, and firing fairly streamlined.\n\nOf special note is the Matrix portions of the game. Any character with Decking skills can jack into computer ports and hack computer systems. The Matrix is represented as a blue-data filled 3D map that uses the same combat system, but swaps out guns for software and hacking skills. This is a great cyberpunk element that also acts as a tideturner for certain scenarios. For example, one scenario has you infiltrate a warehouse only to have to backtrack out of it under heavy fire. All of a sudden, the Decker, who is little more than a squishy thief-style class becomes a powerhouse when she jacks into the warehouse's network and overrides the turret system. Too satisfying for words.\n\nIf your a fan of old school cRPGs, well-constructed stories and settings, Cyberpunk or urban fantasy, do yourself a favor and pick this game up. It is well worth your time and money.","December 29, 2014","true","9.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This game has completely changed my thoughts on the turn based genre. Boasting a retro style of play with nice digital graphics and amazing concept art, the game looks good. Through in an immersive story and multiple surprises around every corner and you have yourself a winner. The only minus to this game is the lack of a proper tutorial.

Not many games live up to that. The only game I remember playing that lives up to that idea as strongly as this game, is halflife 2. The gameplay itself is only good, the turn based combat is not on the same level as XCOM. But god damn is it a developed story and universe. There isn't a bunch of filler crap on every mission where it feels like youre grinding in order for the game developers to say "we have 100 hours of gameplay". There are occasional bugs, but in general the UI is intuitive and stuff behaves as it should. I thoroughly recommend this game to an extent that cant be said of many other games.

I still feel the world is way to small/instanced but it feels much more lively this time around.  Changed the combat HUD which I am not sure why it really needed to change but I guess people complained abou it. I found it fine as is though I must admit it does look streamlined now. The option to bypass missions by several means is now available much more often than before. However it is still too linear for me. I just feel as if this game should be more open sandbox style. However as I watch the changes to Shadowrun Online it seems as if that is slowly going in the direction I had wanted for this game as well as its predecesor.\n\nOverall very solid gamplay. Combat feedback is very nice. I can now tell why I crit or why I didn't instead of having to vaguely guess why it happened. You command a team this time around which is kind of sweet and the story is much more intriguing for me. The Matrix still leaves so much to be desired and as such it's almost a waste to be a decker even though it can open up some interesting avenues. I can see myself playing a few runs through on this even if to only try a few different classes. The story wont change but at least I feel somewhat compelled to play it again compared to Returns.\n\nDon't forget to check out the workshop for custom UGC's. There are some that are definitely worth it including some that are still works in progress. I would reccomend Dragonfall if you don't have Returns as it is defintely the better of the two. If you did buy it and liked it or not I would reccomend giving this one a go especially while it's on sale.","December 29, 2014","true","49.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Interaction/exploration yields a good deal of backstory, and provides a sense of verisimilitude and depth. Even minor characters have a semblance of being living, breathing creatures.\n\nCons; A few interface hangs mar the experience without being game-breaking. Most noteworthy were action hangs in the matrix. Did not require restarts/reloads, but entering/exiting menus and quickly hitting end-turn were necessary.\n\nCharacter building offers a depth that can overwhelm casual players, and feel constraining for those who want to build something diverse.\n\nInventory space is at a premium -especially for decker/rigger builds-.\n\nStory: A\n\nPros; As mentioned previous, even the minor characters have a story to tell, and a place in the world. The central figures have much more so. A true sense of growth and change for those who put the effort into pursuing it.\n\nI won't go into details on the plot, but I will say that I personally found it well written and executed. The story told was one I wanted to keep hearing. I enjoyed the decisions, and the consequences thereof. I enjoyed the antagonist characters as much as I did the protagonists, and did not feel as though they were cartoon cutouts plastered up to give you something to chase.\n\nCons; The only real downside I have is that I felt the experience could have been spread out a little more. But that sentiment isn't one of "lacking value", but rather a deep appreciation for the world I'd been immersed in, and a desire to see and experience more of it.\n\nArt design / Sound design:  B\n\nPros; The artistic choices reflect a deep understanding and appreciation for the IP. From the darkest slum to the brightest corporate office, the environments felt rich and detailed.\n\nThe audio was rather simple, but conveyed all the meaning it was meant to, and never pulled away from the immersion of the scene.  The sound design as a whole fit the world it was built for, and I was impressed by some of the more subtle aspects in regards to audio for magic.\n\nCons; In a nutshell? Old tools. With a bigger budget, and the same love and devotion, this could easily stand against AAA titles. I don't consider this a failing, but I hope to see more from HBS, and would love to see them tackle the shadows with deeper pockets.\n\nReplay value: Moderately low, by itself. Moderately high if the Shadowrun community puts in the effort to tell new stories.\n\nThere are a lot of different ways to play through the game, and a lot of builds to experiment with. But like a good book, once you've read it, you know where it's going to take you. The journey can be fun, but the destination remains the same.\n\nMy bottom line:\n\nIf you enjoy turn-based combat and tactics, have no fear of reading a good book, and enjoy a darker tale, this will be right up your alley.\n\nIt's worth the play, and I'm honestly kind of sad to have waited as long as I had to experience it.","January 6, 2015","true","44.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I mean, they really hit a grand slam on every aspect of the game.  It's a lot like an interactive novel, except you get to play out the fight scenes.  Plot driven Character development is the best I've seen, ever, in any game.  And... if that's not your thing... don't talk to your team mates.  If you do listen to them, you'll feel for them.  I have to say, not once, in any game ever, have I felt an attachment to any character, until now. I get chills playing through most of the missions, reading the deep well written back story for each and every mission.  The AI seems semi-intelligent as well... they always go for my shaman, as he's my weakest link, survival-wise.  And choices... so many choices.  Many skippable runs, some minor, some major. So many different ways to overcome obstacles... locked door?  Send a drone throught a vent, or have your "muscle" break it down, or have your decker hack the security terminal, or have your shaman astral plane and see the keys that have been pressed, etc.\nIf you don't like to read, well, you may not like this game.

This is your true to heart and classic CRPG. Good, solid turn based mechanics, varied character building, engaging and excellent narrative and storytelling, characters you grow attached to, and an immersive and expansive world.\n\nDragonfall fixes pretty much all the problems with Shadowrun Returns.\nIt's much less linear and the addition of a hub makes you feel much more connected to the game. You grow fond of your little community and the people who live within in.\nYou are given choices in this game and even if they don't implicitly seem to matter in the long run, they matter morally to you and to your character. Roleplaying recommended.\nPermanant squadmates. With personal storyline quests and character development.\nAn engaging plot that makes you feel more included in the world--that you are influencing the world around you and making changes for the better or the worse.\nMuch better UI system. It's clearer what cover you're characters are in and what skills you have available.\nSkill checks that actually decide how you go about things. Don't have decking 3 to unlock the door? Is your strength high enough to kick it down? Is your charisma high enough to talk your way through sticky situations?\nA harder challenge than the too easy Shadowrun Returns. You have armor, flanking, and covering to work around.Dragonfall retains what made Shadowrun Returns so good: an immersive world, incredible storytelling driven by excellent and plentiful writing, and tangible characters. It takes what Shadowrun Returns did right, fixes its weak points and made everything better.\n\nIf you liked Shadowrun Returns do yourself a favour and play Dragonfall. If you thought Shadowrun Returns was too linear or lacked a truely compelling plot gives Dragonfall a shot. If you haven't played Shadowrun Returns but like turn based RPGs and/or cyberpunk play Dragonfall over Shadowrun Returns (but I suggest you play Shadowrun Returns anyway). They're standalone titles.  If you hate reading and good storytelling stay far, far away from this game.","January 2, 2015","true","31.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It also has a much thicker and more meaningful plotline than the prior Shadowrun game, especially within the bounds of character development for your team.\n\nThere's less to micromanage this time around; when giving a team member an item, it's explicit it is being "loaned".   You run with a team instead of just whoever you can afford, and you spend time doing actual runs instead of constantly following a linear sequence of events.\n\nMy one complaint is one mission: APEX Rising.   Without spoiling too much, you get your typical choice with an AI at one point; set it free or kill it dead.   This mission was really phoned in, not because of it's particular story, but because I think it was developed by the dev team's unpaid intern.   No matter which you choose, what happens next is the same: kill an endless wave of robots that all have a rediculous amount of health and junkies that all carry stun guns while defending a computer terminal.   There is a timer you have to wait out; this timer is only triggered by having your decker(s) hack two terminals.   There are also two turret terminals to give you some automated help, but only on one side at a time (both terminals cant' be active).\n\nWhat isn't obvious is your team of four has to defend the central computer from robots and junkies trying to kill it, but also defend the terminals (which are far from the central computer) from hackers that can pause the timer by getting a full turn near the terminal.   If this happens, you have to re-play the entire hack to get the terminal working again.\n\nThe end result is a mission where tactics mean nothing; you're entirely at the mercy of the Random Number Generator.  It all depends on whether or not all those taser shots connect, and which targets the turrets pick (they pick enemies at random).   Some of the junkies take a stim (also at random) which lets them move three times, enough to run past the turrets in one round and lock down the timer.\n\nI'm not one to normally complain about difficulty.   I was already a gamer when the NES was new.   The problem here is that you cannot save during this mission once any enemies have spawned as a result of the hacking.  The save file corrupts when you try, and you have to force-quit Shadowrun and re-open it.  Forum searches tell me this is a common bug, in this mission only.   This game is the kind of game where it's reasonable to expect dinnertime or a phone call or something to interrupt a long battle; you can't do that here unless you leave the game running.  Other bugs (which force you to quit and reload from your last functional save) include parts of the Matrix disappearing and trapping characters in it, a sudden inability to issue commands, and stuttering when trying to hack a terminal.\n\nTwo hours of trying to get through that one section of that one mission and no luck.   I probably won't come back to this until it's been so long I start over.","December 27, 2014","true","46.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I picked up this game about two days ago during the sale since it was so cheap. I have to say, this is the most fun I have had in an rpg in a long time. The interactions between my character and the people of the world feel pretty genuine. It is nice to play a game where when I am an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to somebody they can call me out on it, or when I am being nice to win someone over they can see right through it. From a gameplay perspective I find the game to be even more fun. The only experience I have had with turnbased cover oriented combat was the Xcom series, which though I am awful at I still love. The combat in this game can be slow and strategic or very fast paced depending on how you choose to spend karma. Speaking of Karma, I am in love with how your skills effect the dialogue  in the game. Much in the way of how the Fallout series works (The only example I can think of) the skills you pick can have an impact on your characters speech.

I felt compelled to finish battles efficiently so I could progress the story.\n\nOther notes: Originally developed for tablets, the game looks awkward on large resolution screens.

After the last Shadowrun game I was somewhat disappointed as it felt pointless and boring. Dragonfall is much better and fleshed out. You have interesting companions, characters and cabals like in  Planescape:Torment, you have a generic RPG system with a bunch of skill checks like in Neverwinter Nights, you have party play like in Baldur's Gate, conspiracies like in Deus EX and the feel of the classic Shadowrun SNES RPG or a PNP Shadowrun campaign.\nThe missions play mostly one after another but at times you can choose from several or skip some completely. The city hub with its inhabitants feels very alive and the death of a particular character I  always revisited for talk bothered me. Unlike most other games the nice answer isn't always the right one when talking to your friends just like in reality.\n\nThe plot is above average and all of Shadowruns's interesting themes (read the "threats" sourcebooks) are brought together except vampires maybe.\nThe game is set in shadow Germany which is known and yet alien and rarely used for games outside world wars so that was interesting as well.\nThere's also plenty of stuff to read for lore freaks but lore haters can skip the flavor and just follow the mission goals.\nExperience is rewarded by finishing goals so there's no penalty for playing it your way. You can play a brutal and amoral killer or a kind charismatic guy.\nWhile the turnbased combat system is clearly like the one from the last game it seems much better now so I guess they made some improvements.\n\nI can recommend the game to true RPG fans especially those mentioned above and also Shadowrun/Cyberpunk fans.","December 30, 2014","true","24.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Well, a roleplaying game in a dystopia future with magic, tech, drugs, politics, double-crossing and otther filth. It is not affraid to pick adult themes. Furthermore, if you look in all the nooks and crannies you can even find comments in the game that make you think about your actions; If you whipe-out that rascist organization, what about the kids that were there just to get of the street to be warm and have meal? Another example is your fellow shadowrunner who is a victim of prejudices and domestic violence. Rarely did I see this in RPGs and I played a good many. Now, not every NPC is like that and some are a bit one-dimensional, but such archtypes can be fun to have around.\n\nLike its predecessor, this RPG has turn-based combat (like e.g. X-COM or Space Marines) but with its own unique twists. In comparison to Deadman's Switch, cover has grown in importance. So, what else is new? Dragonfall places more emphasis on different stats and social etiquettes. Spells are explained more clearly and in the Matrix you can actually find statements about meatspace that you were involved in. Also some quests have taken a lighter tone with more humor, but that may or may not be to your taste.\n\nAll in all, this game is interresting for any strategist, that has the balls to adress more adult themes, and that all in the unique and intriguing world of Shadowrun. I recommend this game (and its previously mentioned predecessor) for any RPG fan and for anyone that loves to read Dark Fantasy, Dystopian Futures, or Noir fiction.","December 31, 2014","true","180.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It's really been a while since I got as immersed in a story and this game manages to tell its story without any shiny cutscenes. The main characters are all memorable, at least if you had the option to talk to them a bit more. I only kind of discovered you could actually unlock sidemissions by talking to your team shortly before the end. So I just spam-talked myself to all the missions and they make some of the characters a lot more interesting.\n\nIf you know XCOM then you pretty much know the combat system but to those who don't: you have a certain percentage of hit chance and critical chance and different forms of cover.  The entire thing is turn-based and everyone has a certain amount of actions they can perform in a single round. That also means that walking distance is restriced. One thing I dont like about this is that the game has the habbit of missing an unbelievable amount of 95% hit-chance hits. And no there is not a decent amount of hits despite low percentage to balance that.\n\nThe sidemissions are pretty much all interesting and you dont have to be a die-hard completionist to happily have done about 90% of what the game has to offer.\n\nAnother thing I like is that you dont get XP for kills. You get XP when you finish a mission and somtimes when you for example do something important on some machine or something then you also get XP in a mission. The lack of kill-XP however means you actually look for ways to avoid a fight. Usually a game says "there is a lot of them there, better go around that" and the reaction would be "and give up extra XP? aw hell no!" but here you actually do it to not waste another medkit.\n\nI played the game on normal difficulty and I cant say I ever really got stuck in a fight. barely ever even used a medkit. I played a troll street samurai focused on melle combat. and by focused I mean that I shot less than 20 times throughout all combats together. I made a giant machine of doom covered in armor and strong enough to break apart anything in my way. This of course means I had no magic or hacking capabilities of any sort and also wasnt very charismatic or smart. But while sometimes you might have to pay extra for an information you cant charm out of someone in the end there isnt to much you miss when focusing on combat only, as long as you have a crewmember do all the hacking.\n\nMoney also isnt to much of a problem, sometimes you will need to do another mission beofre you can buy that thing you want so badly, but in the end I had so much money when going on my last run that there really wasnt anything left for me to buy. Then again I never really bothered buying equipment for anyone other than myself since everyone else automatically goes into each mission with their stuff.\n\n\nAll together this is pretty much 26 hours of fun and that is a lot more than I can say for many games that I played.","January 1, 2015","true","28.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It wasn't a bad game, it was an 'ok' game, where we expected something very good. For that reason, I avoided Dragonfall for a long time, even after the positive reviews.\nThe wait was absolutely worth it. Dragonfall - Director's Cut is a fantastic rpg game. It's less linear than it's predecessor, the combat is more balanced. The story is exceptionally good, which is always very important in an rpg game. What makes it even better, is the fact that your decisions really matter, so the replay value is more than just rolling a different character.\nAlso, huge kudos for the NPCs (well most of them anyway). You know that feeling from old rpg games, where you actually REALLY cared about your teammates? What their motivations are, what's their story, their plans? Dragonfall - Director's Cut absolutely delivers in that regard as well.

First off, I just finished beating the game once and I am ready to play it again to try a different path and possible ending. If that's not an indicator of a good game, I don't know what is.\n\nI will echo many other reviews in that I 100% agree Dragonfall is much more advanced than the recent Shadowrun Returns. I have completed the SNES version when it came out (Yes, I am a grandpa gamer), and in many ways it's better than that and other ways it isn't. The SNES version's environment was very open, so much so that it was easy to get lost. But at least you could beef up Jake Armitage which was fun to hulk him up. Dragonfall isn't as open environment as the SNES version, but it is no where the linear game that was in Shadowrun Returns. Dragonfall is very much a 'Goldie Locks' between the two. In fact at different points in the game, you need to make choices that directly impacts the outcome of runs. So although the story progresses itself in a linear fashion, based upon what you decide and act completely effects the game.\n\nI do believe the game designers' intent of allowed the gamer to make these important decisions was with purpose. Allowing for decisions also invests the gamer in the story's plot. The main storyline is interesting as well as some of the optional side quests. As any good story or movie goes, there always is a twist that you don't foresee. I was close in my assumption. You can also become involved in your teammate NPC characters as well as powering them up.\n\nI would definitely recommend this game. It should not disappoint. I bought this for myself during the Christmas 2014 sale, and the cost was completely worth it. I don't believe you'll be disappointed with this version of the Shadowrun franchise.\n\n","January 1, 2015","true","43.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

You build a character from a blank slate, using a class system that is both manageable and flexible, allowing, for example, your Hacker class character to learn magic from the get-go, if  you so choose. And then the world unfurls around you, replete with body modifications, A.I.s, hackers, urban sprawl, street drugs, meta-humans, ghosts-in-the-machine and so much more.\n\nThe graphics aren't jaw-dropping, but the environment and combat effects blend to create a great atmosphere and tone for the game. The combat is easy to pick up, essentially being a turn based tactical battle system where each character uses a pool of AP to move and attack. What's impressive about the combat is how organic it feels. The majority of your NPC companions start out with guns, and yet the turn-based system makes aiming, reloading, and firing fairly streamlined.\n\nOf special note is the Matrix portions of the game. Any character with Decking skills can jack into computer ports and hack computer systems. The Matrix is represented as a blue-data filled 3D map that uses the same combat system, but swaps out guns for software and hacking skills. This is a great cyberpunk element that also acts as a tideturner for certain scenarios. For example, one scenario has you infiltrate a warehouse only to have to backtrack out of it under heavy fire. All of a sudden, the Decker, who is little more than a squishy thief-style class becomes a powerhouse when she jacks into the warehouse's network and overrides the turret system. Too satisfying for words.\n\nIf your a fan of old school cRPGs, well-constructed stories and settings, Cyberpunk or urban fantasy, do yourself a favor and pick this game up. It is well worth your time and money.","December 29, 2014","true","9.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The price was right and i wanted to play something new on steam as my xbox live subscription came to an end. I picked up the game with the knowledge that i was not a huge fan of turnbased rpg's nor was i experienced with the shadowrun universe. This game has completely changed my thoughts on the turn based genre. Boasting a retro style of play with nice digital graphics and amazing concept art, the game looks good. Through in an immersive story and multiple surprises around every corner and you have yourself a winner. The only minus to this game is the lack of a proper tutorial. Ive never read manuls though so im not really bothered. This is a must buy for any PC Gamer.","December 29, 2014","true","2.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The game is highly addictive and the story is broad. The producers of this game put their heart and soul into this game and it is visible. If you are doubting about buying the "other shadowrun game" because of the quality and content: BUY IT. You will 100% enjoy this version if you did the last (and maybe more...

This is the second in the line of games that Harebrained Schemes done for Shadowrun.\n\nIf you liked the Pencil and Paper RPGs  (Shadowrun, Cyberpunk 2020, Gurps Cyberpunk), cyberpunk themed games and playing turn-based single player campaign games, you might love this game.\n\nIt has a game editor for making new missions that the community been using to improve it with and to extend the life of the game. Go through the Workshop and subscribe to the large selection of community made campaigns. It comes with the HBS campaign called Dragonfall.\n\nYou play a character that can hire others to his team and do a mission.  You control the actions of each member of the team. While gameplay is mostly linear, some small amount of exploration is possible while completing objectives. The player can enter into dialogue with various characters, with different statistics and skills giving new dialogue options.\n\nIt comes with the new campaign called Dragonfall which is based in Berlin, Germany.  The Dragonfall campaign starts out pretty hard.  Check the Workshop for other user created mod campaigns, try some of them if you are stuck on Dragonfall compaign. They have worked the bugs out and added more Shadowrun items to this newer version.\n\nHas Steam Achievement added to this version of game on the Dragonfall campaign.

It's X-Com meets Fantasy, trolls and elves fighting high tech orcs and dwarves. Cast lightning bolts and fireballs, or summon spirits of fire and wind. If that's not your schtick, why not try sniping someone, after designating them your target with your laser sight eye?\n\nEver wanted to be a cyborg with metal arms/legs, a datajack to hack into the matrix and eyes that see beyond those of metahumans? Do it, cast magic while you're at it. The customization system is exceptionally diverse, you can kill your enemies in a multitude of ways. Run n' Gun, cut to ribbons with a sword, throw shuriken into them, paralyze them with lightning, melt with acid...it's all up to you.\n\nThe base classes remain, all having a facelift in terms of weapons and fun. The use for each playstyle really presents itself throughout the game, deckers will see and do things a mage never will, and vise versa. But, as it's an rpg you can be a spell casting robot controlling hacker, or a sword swinging spirit summoning ninja. You are restricted solely by your actions, the karma you earn and the imagination you have.\n\nShadowrun: Dragonfall - Director's Cut is my favorite game I've played in 2014, without a doubt. I'm endlessly excited to get every single achievment and continue to try different playstyles. If you're remotely considering this game, I cannot endorse it more. This is without a doubt and end all be all for those aspiring to see the cyberpunk dystopian fantasy world of shadowrun, but can't be in a PnP session.

Immediately.\n\nThe only annoyance I've discovered so far is that, playing as a shaman, summoning points for spirits seem to be few and far between. It's especially noticeable in areas with large fight scenes, where you'd expect to find at least one point, and there are none (final fight involving smugglers, for example). It's not game-breaking, and probably done for balance reasons because spirits are powerful, but in the pen & paper Shadowrun, shamans can summon spirits nearly anywhere.","January 26, 2015","true","53.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Would say 'strategy' but that mostly relies on metagame knowledge.\n\nDialogue options allow for several types of characters (bleeding heart or experienced shadowrunner).  Characters have rich backstories and optional missions to help resolve some loose ends for them.  The setting is oozing with cyberpunk charm and there are plenty of notes and emails to bring life to an already believable anarchist Berlin.  Choices have consequences, even if some are only getting some hateful email from somebody you wronged during a job.\n\nThe only gripe I have is how combat is initiated by the enemy.  This often happens when you use a dialogue option to 'Attack', open a door, round a corner, or load into a new zone.  This always happens with your main character in the lead, your group huddled around him/her for warmth, out of cover, and enemies in or moving to cover.  The enemy moves and acts first, they favor squishy targets, and they love grenading tightly packed groups of sheep.  Kicks you right out of the experience everytime you see your crack squad of shadowrunners who have seen so many raids but get caught flat-footed when breaching a room full of guards they know are there.","December 19, 2014","true","33.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

A masterpiece of RPG work, minorly suffering from the one or other bug.\nTook me 24 hours to beat the game. (Once, on hard difficultY.) That alone is already a big plus, given the price of the game. AND opposed to many other campaign-driven games I actually think I'll give this game a rerun.\n\n\nTo the details.\nThe game is set in the Shadowrun world, which originally stems from a Pen&Paper RPG, set in a sortof-apocalyptic future (in this case 2052), where magic works again, trolls and orcs walk the earth like any human, megacoperations control most of the world... and dragons control the megacorporations from the shadows. Said shadows are your realm as well, assome sort of crinimal spec ops, a Shadowrunner.\n\nThe game starts by letting you create a unique character with full flexibility as to what you want to do. Troll engineer? Elf brute? Sure, go ahead. Note that your PC (Playercharacter) is the ONLY character in this game you can fully customize. All other members of your team come with preset skills, equipment and a small upgrade tree (and the possibility to give them some of your quipment on a 'loaned' basis). So,no BG-style minmaxing of a 6-man supertroop.\n\nThe gameplay consists of realtime-exploration, coupled with a lot of text, choices and some riddles. The other part (and something that will never be avoidable fully) is combat. Combat plays interesting, from start to finish, mainly due to you and your team unlocking new abilities and equipment. As well, it needs to be said that there are a lot of mechanics to grasp that are barely explained in the brief help section... Don't be surprised if you don't understand what's happening around you for the first half of the game. On top of that, the controls are a bit flunky at times (f.e. you cannot turn the isometric view and due to that will never be able to select a tile right 'behind' a standing character). Overall, satisfying enough though.\n(Especially if you can play as a cyber-augmented Chi-casting samurai warrior dwarf)\n\nTo avoid spoilers, I'll not go into detail regarding the story. But let's express my oppinion this way: From start to finish I always felt motivated and intrigued by story. Driven to find out the backgrounds, and what could happen next. The morale choices the game presents you (and boy, it does that alot) as well never felt to simple. And when you come to the big turning points in the story (that have major influence on the gameplay), you really sit down, lean back and think for a minute or two before pressing a button.\n\nI feel obliged to mention the presence of a few bugs, too: I had to do the final fight twice, simply because one enemy got stuck in an inaccessible room. I as well had the one or other occasion where an enemy AI got stuck during it's turn, causing an endless loop of waiting. And there are a few reports of crashes, albeit I had none of those myself.\nOverall, these issues usually are annoying, but are reasonably rare enough (having to reload 3 times across a 24 hour timeframe... annoying, but I've seen FAAAAR worse).\n\n\n\nAll in all, my verdict is: BUY NOW\nThe story is genuinly great. The background is great (duh, it's a Pen&Paper RPG, what did you expect). The gameplay is solid and diverse enough. Graphics are fine for their purpouse, the sound is acceptable (albeit hit sound grunts get really repetitive), the music just awesome and fitting. The game is stable, except for a few rare issues.\nRating: 9/10 (just slightly missed the perfection, due to control hickups, lack of tutorials and the few issues mentioned)\n\n\nIf you see this on a sale, BUY.\nIf it's not on a sale, but you're a fan of Shadowrun... who am I kidding, any fan of Shadowrun already has this game. But if you're into (P&P) RPG anyways, get this.\nIf you like Tactical Combat games, you might want to buy this, too. Albeit the focus clearly lays on the Story, not the Combat System alone.","December 4, 2014","true","29.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Yes, while not enough experience properly handling a gun may result in terrible accuracy, given the lives of the characters in the game, you would think they're more than capable of shooting someone in the open.  While, they are at a higher percentage to be shot, it's still not 100% which I find sometimes very dissatisfying especially when behind full cover, I still get hit lol.  While it is a game and there is luck involve, I find it frustrating.\n\nThat doesn't stop me from however enjoying the game when I do finally get lucky and hit them.  It once took me 4 turns to take down one person because I would constantly miss, even around 70-80%.  Luckily, I was able to kill the few other people that were with her, but still the inconstancy will never cease to amaze me.\n\nIf you love the cRPG genre, I suggest this game cause of it's similar and nostalgic feel to it, however, if you're just diving into the genre, be forewarn, RNGesus isn't kind to non-100%.","December 4, 2014","true","35.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The combat is on the slow side with plenty of glitches, the cover and flanking system simply does not work sometimes, and for some reason the game lags (no matter what my system settings are) whenever I move outside of combat. Oh and another thing that this game should copy from xcom is the ability to ROTATE THE ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ CAMERA. Hope you like the perspective you have at the start because its all you ever get.\nNow obviously this game can compensate for that or else I wouldn't be recommending it and it does this by having diverse and interesting characters, a flushed out game world with side plots and new people to interact with popping up after almost every mission, and a very appealing art style. Im a huge fan of story based games that allow for multiple personalities and SDDC has handled this very well so far.  I snuck up on a pay slave mid mission and had the option to either break his neak or tap his shoulder. After debating the merrits of both for about 30 seconds I tapped his shoulder, had a quick conversation with him then sent him home back to his family and gained karma  I love the way the karma system works because you recieve enticing rewards for whatever choice you make and dont feel like you need to reload a save just to see if your other choices would have led to better rewards.\n\nI might rewrite this review after I beat the game but so far I can say that its a good game in my books so buy it, load it up, and have fun blowing a power armored thugs brain out with a troll armed with a sniper rifle.","October 27, 2015","true","27.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Dragonfall - Director's Cut outshines its predecessor in every area. While taking nothing away from the fantastic maiden project that was SR:R, this stand-alone expansion is so much more than that descriptor would imply.\n\nThe main campaign is three to perhaps five times the length of the original Deadman's Switch in SRR. Rather than being given a linear series of missions to tackle, Dragonfall grants significantly more freedom in choosing which tasks to embark on, or pass up. On your runs, you'll encounter various ways to tackle the obstacles presented - varied dialogue options that take numerous stats into account, drones to go where full-sized bodies cannot, magical perception to read more into the situation, plugging into the Matrix to disable security, stealth, and the tried-and-true guns ablaze kick-down-the-front-door-and-take-no prisoners brute force method.\n\nThe dialogue options presented with a colorful cast of characters feels like your choices carry some weight. Better, still, those choices have nuance, and are more varied than the Bioware standard of saint, aloof, and spawn of Satan reponses. I greatly enjoyed following up with numerous NPCs between runs, both to see what new opportunities there were for my character's advancement, but to find out what had transpired while my character was away from her base of operations.\n\nThere's no obnoxious, arbitrary morality system in play. The player is free to choose and truly step into the role of the character they create. Certainly, there are circumstance that arise where the player must make a morally ambiguous choice. Do you do the job you were hired to, and assassinate your target before he reveals vital information, or do you hear his side of the story? Do you turn over a powerful weapon to a shadowy secret society promising you great rewards? Do you risk alienating your team for your own reward? Do you stick your neck out for them, knowing it is taking valuable resources and time away from your main goal?\n\nSpeaking of your team, I found those NPCs some of the most interesting I've come across in my life of gaming. Each has their own distinct motivations, reasons for being there, and outlooks on life. There's Dietrich, the former punk-rocker turned shaman with strong anarchist values. There's Eiger, no-nonsense weapons specialist, fresh out of a long military career, focused on following orders, responsibility, planning, and chain of command. Glory, a pistol-packing cybered-up field medic, and close-combat specialist; sullen and reserved, with a great mystery to unravel. There's a fourth, with his own uniquely twisted backstory, do you trust a known wild-card, whose allegiances in the past have shifted with the winds?\n\nIn summary, it's a 30-40 hour romp that really tries to encompass as much of the Shadowrun world as possible. Better, it's not set in the mother of all SR locations, the Seattle sprawl, but rather the anarchist Free State of Berlin. You'll encounter everything from the stereotypical chrome and lead Street Samurai, to the down-and-out chem junkie, to plain folks just trying to get by. It's not perfect, and it does miss a couple of the things long-time fans of the Shadowrun franchise might miss. In terms of freedom to get into a character, interact, and engage with an evolving world where your actions carry weight and consequence - this recommendation is a no-brainer.\n\nIf this sounds like your cup of tea, I can think of far worse ways to spend $15 or less and 30 hours or more of your time.","July 11, 2015","true","50.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The game is highly addictive and the story is broad. The producers of this game put their heart and soul into this game and it is visible. If you are doubting about buying the "other shadowrun game" because of the quality and content: BUY IT. You will 100% enjoy this version if you did the last (and maybe more...

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/noahp/recommended/300550/","noahp","Haon the Great","http://steamcommunity.com/id/noahp/","84 products in account","I just finshed my first runthrough of this game and I have to say\n...\nTHIS IS THE BEST RPG I HAVE PLAYED IN YEARS!!!\n\nCombat Gameplay:  This is a squad based RPG with light tactical components (Cover, area of affect, etc.)  Overall I really enjoyed combat.  It's solid, with the only two downfalls being the unpredictable choice of who shoots first and the fact that the AI cannot attack twice (though as a boardgamer, this is actually fairly standard).  Also, you will have the occasional miss - or two, or three - at 99%, making it seem like there are more to the mechanics than the percentages let on.\n\nArt style: Pretty good.  It's hard to critique postapacolyptic art style.  You love it or hate it.  Typically, I love it, and Dragonfall is no different.  Also, great portraits.\n\nWriting: Oh. My. Goodness.  I have NEVER enjoyed reading in a game this much, with the possible exception of the Mass Effect Codex.  Yes, you read everything.  Yes, there is NO/ZERO/NADA voice acting.  Who cares?  The writing in this game is simply sublime.  The characters are varied, the desciptions of the scenes are fantastic, most NPC's have something interesting to say.  The story is incredible, the ending rocked.  Seriously, the best writing outside of a book.  Excellent job, HBS!!!\n\nRPG elements and non-combat gameplay: Personally, here is where the game really shined.  There are a plethora of tech, combat and magic skills to choose from.  ABout 95% of the skills are useful in combat, so pick your poison and run with it.  I was a drone operator (read: my bots are BADASS!!!) and hacker.  The latter let me throw lead in the real world without a gun, while the latter let me access all kinds of nifty stuff - turrets, cameras, cash.  I will say the hacking options were a little few and far between, but not disheartenling so.\n\nIn addition to combat usefulness, about 40% (caveat: I do that playing a mage had some choices that weren't visible to my tech guy, but since most unavailable skill options are greyed out rather than not there, I'm going with a low number) of the skills have dialoge and environmental usefulness as well.  Now, do these options provide Witcher level game alterations? No.  But they allow you to craft your very own flavor of a charcter and really let you immerse yourself in the game.  Sure, you get to roughly the same spot in the end, but the pleasure of saying it your way: it's great.  I wish there were more options; I'll update after my mage run-through.\n\nI seriously cannot say enough good things about this game.  Ignore the bad reviews and snag this.  For the price of a good meal, you get to sink your teeth into a superb dystopian story.  Enjoy!","June 6, 2015","true","63.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

These hopes were not only fulfilled but utterly blown out of the water. Everything was improved upon and was an utter joy to learn more about the cypernetic world of Shadowrun. The people you interact with are MUCH MUCH more fleshed out to the point where you will do anything to keep them alive. Few are the games of this caliber and even fewer are the ones that can make me binge for 7 hours straight without noticing.

You have a team, and each member can take a couple actions a turn.  Characters have special abilities and different attack types.  There is a fair amount of variety.  Some characters excel at firearms, others at melee combat.  Mages can cast both damaging and buffing spells.  Summoners can call spirits, and riggers can control drones (the two "pet" classes).  Hackers have their own VR combat where they fight IC in a system very similar to meat combat.  The hacker's efforts in VR can grant access to other areas on the map, provide camera feeds, gain information that can be sold for money and other things.  In addition to character design, there are choices to make in combat such as where to take cover, how to flank enemies, etc.  It's a good system.\n\nAs I said above, however, the story is what has really sold me on the game.  Between missions, interactions with NPCs shed light on the developing narrative, and the story kept me engaged.  What's more, each of your team members has their own story to tell.  The stories add a great depth to the characters.  These are not just spell/gun machines that follow you around in combat.  They are living, breathing people struggling with their own motivations.  It's very interesting learning what they are.  I'm perhaps halfway through the game, and I already have a strong emotional connection to the characters who's stories I've played through.\n\nI recommend this game.  For those familiar with the original Shadowrun Returns, this is a definite improvement, both in game play and in storytelling.  It is a solid representation of the tactical combat genre, the RPG genre, and the Shadowrun setting.","May 31, 2015","true","23.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The combat was mediocre, the character building very limited, role playing insignificant and the overall game was forgetable.\n\nStill decided to give Dragonfall a try and I'm really glad I did. Combat and character building are left pretty much unchanged but MY GOD THE WRITING. The dialogue, the characters, the side plots, the missions and the choices you face, it got me hooked.\n\nIt's not the type of a free-roaming RPG I'm used to (like the recent Wasteland 2 for example), there isn't much exploration or enviromental usage of skills and even though there are side quests and separate plot lines, the game is still pretty linear. But you can be sure that when the game presents you with a choice it will be a significant and satisfying one, and the multitude of dialogue options makes it a truly role playing experience, even though the difference between your replies is often cosmetic.\n\nIf you enjoy dialogue-rich games, definitely try this one.","June 13, 2015","true","39.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Right from the get-go, it was clear that devs put a huge amount of heart into realizing the game world.  The opening chapter is predictable but mercifully short--a heist gone wrong, a leader killed, a conspiracy unveiled--and it only gets better from there.  The members of your team follow through with their respective tropes convincingly enough to keep the narrative flowing, as do the side characters you encounter during missions.  A few even stand out, particularly Glory, whose oddly fast transformation from stony-faced killer to relatable anti-hero takes some surprising turns before it concludes.  The highlights of the story are the decisions you have to make, which begin innocuously enough (do I kill the gangers or work with them?) and, at their best, bring up questions of friendship, morality, and purpose that could give Telltale a run for their money.\n\nThe gameplay runs well enough to keep the narrative going, although impatient players may find the slow running speeds and occasionally laborious turn-based combat hard to handle.  For fans of tactical RPGs, don't go in expecting Baldur's Gate or Fire Emblem, but it's rich enough that your character's fighting style will certainly emerge as his or her own while simple enough to grasp early on, before too many skill points are wasted.  Party controls (or the lack thereof, outside combat) are the biggest disappointment, but at the end of the day, their absence doesn't get in the way of too much.\n\nUltimately, slow combat movement and occasionally awkward control issues don't inhibit the compelling narrative that comes out of this game.  Recommended for people who need their fix of hard choices between Telltale installments.","August 2, 2015","true","30.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

There are occasional bugs, but in general the UI is intuitive and stuff behaves as it should. I thoroughly recommend this game to an extent that cant be said of many other games.

I still feel the world is way to small/instanced but it feels much more lively this time around.  Changed the combat HUD which I am not sure why it really needed to change but I guess people complained abou it. I found it fine as is though I must admit it does look streamlined now. The option to bypass missions by several means is now available much more often than before. However it is still too linear for me. I just feel as if this game should be more open sandbox style. However as I watch the changes to Shadowrun Online it seems as if that is slowly going in the direction I had wanted for this game as well as its predecesor.\n\nOverall very solid gamplay. Combat feedback is very nice. I can now tell why I crit or why I didn't instead of having to vaguely guess why it happened. You command a team this time around which is kind of sweet and the story is much more intriguing for me. The Matrix still leaves so much to be desired and as such it's almost a waste to be a decker even though it can open up some interesting avenues. I can see myself playing a few runs through on this even if to only try a few different classes. The story wont change but at least I feel somewhat compelled to play it again compared to Returns.\n\nDon't forget to check out the workshop for custom UGC's. There are some that are definitely worth it including some that are still works in progress. I would reccomend Dragonfall if you don't have Returns as it is defintely the better of the two. If you did buy it and liked it or not I would reccomend giving this one a go especially while it's on sale.","December 29, 2014","true","49.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Interaction/exploration yields a good deal of backstory, and provides a sense of verisimilitude and depth. Even minor characters have a semblance of being living, breathing creatures.\n\nCons; A few interface hangs mar the experience without being game-breaking. Most noteworthy were action hangs in the matrix. Did not require restarts/reloads, but entering/exiting menus and quickly hitting end-turn were necessary.\n\nCharacter building offers a depth that can overwhelm casual players, and feel constraining for those who want to build something diverse.\n\nInventory space is at a premium -especially for decker/rigger builds-.\n\nStory: A\n\nPros; As mentioned previous, even the minor characters have a story to tell, and a place in the world. The central figures have much more so. A true sense of growth and change for those who put the effort into pursuing it.\n\nI won't go into details on the plot, but I will say that I personally found it well written and executed. The story told was one I wanted to keep hearing. I enjoyed the decisions, and the consequences thereof. I enjoyed the antagonist characters as much as I did the protagonists, and did not feel as though they were cartoon cutouts plastered up to give you something to chase.\n\nCons; The only real downside I have is that I felt the experience could have been spread out a little more. But that sentiment isn't one of "lacking value", but rather a deep appreciation for the world I'd been immersed in, and a desire to see and experience more of it.\n\nArt design / Sound design:  B\n\nPros; The artistic choices reflect a deep understanding and appreciation for the IP. From the darkest slum to the brightest corporate office, the environments felt rich and detailed.\n\nThe audio was rather simple, but conveyed all the meaning it was meant to, and never pulled away from the immersion of the scene.  The sound design as a whole fit the world it was built for, and I was impressed by some of the more subtle aspects in regards to audio for magic.\n\nCons; In a nutshell? Old tools. With a bigger budget, and the same love and devotion, this could easily stand against AAA titles. I don't consider this a failing, but I hope to see more from HBS, and would love to see them tackle the shadows with deeper pockets.\n\nReplay value: Moderately low, by itself. Moderately high if the Shadowrun community puts in the effort to tell new stories.\n\nThere are a lot of different ways to play through the game, and a lot of builds to experiment with. But like a good book, once you've read it, you know where it's going to take you. The journey can be fun, but the destination remains the same.\n\nMy bottom line:\n\nIf you enjoy turn-based combat and tactics, have no fear of reading a good book, and enjoy a darker tale, this will be right up your alley.\n\nIt's worth the play, and I'm honestly kind of sad to have waited as long as I had to experience it.","January 6, 2015","true","44.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The writing is superb, the characters are memorable and the combat is solid.\n\nThis game has A LOT of dialog in it and no voice acting, so know that going in.  I found the game to be a bit too verbose at times.  You spend 50% of the game reading from a tiny panel on the right side of your screen which got tiresome on my wide monitor.\n\nThe combat is a bit clunky, but quite fun.  For most of the game your characters don't have enough AP to move and use their good abilities so you end up moving your guys into position and hoping enemies don't move the next turn. Near the end of the game, you'll have more AP to use and this makes combat MUCH more enjoyable.\n\nOne of the coolest things about this game are the RPG mechanics.  You can often find alternative methods of solving a problem or gaining access to an area.  Taking the time to explore is always rewarded with goodies.\n\nI would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys old-school RPGs like Baldur's Gate.

If you played the first one it's more of the same.  I played the first game on my Android phone and this one on PC and it's definately a game made for smaller screens.  It's a bit awkward panning around the screen to move your characters.  I didn't think the story was anything compelling, unfortunately I read too many good reviews about it and had to try it, but once again like the first one it didn't really engage me as a player.

I could then ignore the shortcomings of the cover system, and keep in mind combat is still better than in the first Shadowrun Returns, but it just wasn't a challenge anymore.

This game isn't for true rushers imo, because if you'd think that you're Rambo you're pretty much left in your undies rather quickly if you're not careful enough..\nBut once you're getting used to the system and you're starting to make progress, the game speads up too and more quests become available to your team as well..\nSo take your time slowly and patiently at first, and you'll do all the better afterwards!\nThe auto-save system can be frustrating at times when you have realized that you've made a critical mistake. So my advice here will be to save your game often instead of having to backtrack over many 'lost' hours ect.

You can only move from one small scene to the next with clearly defined boundaries of who you can talk to and where you can go.

In any case, it is future, and magic started to affect the world about 50 years ago. Large corporations control everything and you are mercenary for hire -  A.K.A "shadowrunner".\n\nGameplay is like X-com, but little worse. Graphics is mix between 2d for background and 3d characters. While I enjoy background like that, it is nothing jaw-dropping. Sound/BGM is ok. So if it is so mediocre, why am I recommending it?\n\nBecause of the story of course. The story alone makes this game one of my favourite games - Over original Shadowrun and even Shadowrun Hong Kong. The main story is engaging, the characters are well portrayed… But there is more depth to it than that.\n\nIt is about the THEME. Not just the main story but the underlying theme that stretches across all of the missions - perhaps too obviously. This game uses its background(Shadowrun Universe) to provide multiple aspect of this theme and I respect Harebrane scheme for making campaign like this. Hopefully, when your character stare at the bullet-proof glass, you will be able to look at reflection of yourself instead of monster on the other side.\n\nIt is unfortunate that I cannot speak further, due to my desire to not spoil anything.\n\nIt is this thematic story(which I have not seen since NWN2 - MotB) that makes me really love this game, and I recommend it to anyone who is into story-driven RPG.","June 3","true","19.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Don't waste your money. Typical game goes like this its 4 vs 40, your runners fire 20 shots with a 96% chance to hit and all shots miss except one which hits one enemy for 2 damage, 40 enemies fire and each scores 2.0x crit for 35 damage with shotguns from sniper rifle range and despite your runners being in heavy cover and wearing max armor and having maxed dodge. This happens over and over and over to the point you don't actually expect you will hit anything most of the time you attack - so much for feeling heroic.I actually found myself wishing I was playing the AI units cause they kick butt compared to your runners. You are regularly forced to run through doorways and small hallways that the enemy will unlease 10-20 grenades on your team which cost 10x what you would earn for the mission. Luckily grenades dont do crap for damage - go figure. After expending all your health kits that cost more than you will likely get paid for the mission you either run out of money or the game locks up mid mission and you reload to an old save losing a level and having to reread 45 minutes of dialogue boxes.

[KAMGUSTA's REVIEW]\n\nFinished in about 20 hours, so I will talk very consciously about it.\nGame started quite bad for my taste, but then things got slightly better... and stabilized on average. I didn't know it was an indie kickstarted project developed for smartphones and tablets in mind and this explains a lot of cons.\n\nFirst, I would like to talk about the gameplay. Having experience with a lot of RPGs and turn-based games I have been disappointed: percentages to hit seem to be flawed, covering system is ridiculous, inventory is caotic, some combo are overpowered (you'll instakill with rifles and relative stats at 8+), experience points are given randomly and not by killing enemies, the stats of your party members are scripted, AI always attacks first (resolved in S:HK) and it' also dumb (you can wait for them at corners or take them from the shoulders), some mobs can't suffer critical hits, you are not given so many possibilities of attacking, you can't use your items outside of combat, often you are not given the option of using your teamates abilities in the quests, etc.\n\nThen, the story: I spent 20+ hours in the game clicking furiously and skipping 2/3 of the useless dialogues. Why "useless"? 1) They are scripted, the choices you'll make DO NOT alter the game (if not a couple of occasions) 2) Skills are useless for dialogues: even when you are given the choice to use them, they just provide a couple of more rows of text to read 3) *someone die, so we have to find the culprit* bla bla *turns out all the city is in danger* bla bla *random excuse for making side missions* bla bla *gear up and go final attack*.\n\nGraphics: from the screenshots it seems to be very powerful... it's not. Just colourful. Game has big optimizations problems even if it's just a 2D world with 3D characters (welcome back '90).\nI got more than a couple of freezings but game always managed to stay alive (one way or another). Quicksaves often "saved" the day, but no crashes as told in some other reviews.\n\nShadowrun Return has the same graphics but don't suffer from these problems: even level loading are quicker! If we compare the two games (with the same latest engine), Dragonfall has a more polished UI, a more intriguing story, nicer matrix puzzles, more turning points, but feels like a revised expansion (which is, in fact).\n\nThe matrix puzzles, the door keyboard puzzles, the stealth mission and some side quests to dig into the past of your teammates are nice additions, but in the end they are just another *clicking*. I would have preferred more attention to the gameplay.\n\nI enjoyed it? Yes and no. Yes because I like these type of games, no because X-Com, Civilizations, Fallout still stand on a higher level. I would call it a nice time waster. If you are looking for a solid game, you should look elsewhere. I hope they'll get better in the next chapters.\n\nBest played with Keyboard & Mouse\nRecommended Buy Price < 20$\nScore 7,5/10","April 26","false","26.7"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","45","5","11","0","0"

You run... in the shadows… surprisingly enough… It’s just a fancy alternative word for “mercenary”. You join a new team and you start off immediately in a mission to assault a glamorous manor! Unfortunately, everything hits the fan and you bail off the mission! Now you and your team need to discover what’s behind the screw up of the mission, along the way you’ll be in place of awesome sidequests that vary the gameplay and narrative!\n\nPacing is very important in game because it avoids the curse of monotony and makes it so the player wants to unravel more to see what the game has to offer more. This is why I consider RE4 one of the best games ever: pacing! Missions range from loud violent fights to others that can avert any kind of fighting if you handle the situation properly. For example, one of the missions is to stop this anti-metahuman that glorify the human race as the only true superior one… in Germany… why does this ring a bell? Progressing is downright enjoyable since you’ll just be unravelling more and more mysteries through the storyline. It is quite linear, you can verge a bit to the right or to the left but at the end of the day, you’re going in a “one way” direction. I don’t mind that actually, I prefer a better structured RPG game rather than one that isn’t as organized and you’re just faffing about. This doesn’t mean that I like to have my hand held, I just like everything properly placed in order.\n\nThe writing is just spot on, it’s not stereotypical and exposition is delivered properly without being shoved down your throat purposely. Talking to characters requires some commitment to their personalities, constantly spamming the “ask X about Y” won’t make them convince them to trust. Don't get me wrong, what I’m saying here isn’t a DYNAMIC dialogue system, you’ll know how to handle your team in conversations right at the get go if you read their profiles in your PC. What’s trickier is handling characters who aren’t of your team, that’s where the challenge in the dialogue comes in, but really, it comes down to your luck and subjective thought, just like in any other RPG.\n\nGood characters, good arcs and good story (much better than SR: R).That’s all that needs to be said about the narrative. I would’ve, however, had much more diversified team, you have only one metahuman, but their personalities compensate that.\nThe Shadowrun reboot continues its mechanics similar to another reboot: XCOM – Enemy Unknown.  A simplified tactical squad turn-based strategy is how I’d describe this, however if you’re looking for combat, XCOM would serve you better. Your key to victory are: chest high walls!\n\nMy main issue of is that Shadowrun’s combat doesn’t have the same visual feedback and depth of XCOM. For example, due to the pre-rendered backgrounds, you don’t have any environmental destruction that can change the level drastically. The only environmental variables in the game are conveniently placed explosive barrels, although unoriginal, they do help with the variety of the battles. That said, this doesn’t mean that the combat system isn’t good and even then, the game tries a couple of small things. You have different firing modes for your weapons, different types of throwables, different melee combat options, battle drones, different magical powers that inflict status changes to characters and the game promotes a lot of consumable uses. The real environmental interactions come from outside of the combat that might affect the combat itself. For a simple example, if you search hard enough, you may be able to turn off the enemy turrets.\n\nAs any RPG, the game has progression system which is a very important part of the game, not only for the combat, but for the story as well. You don’t gain EXP, instead you gain Karma points in small numbers and they do depend when and how your receive them.  Like in Fallout, you can use your points on a certain event to get something out of it. It’s a nice implementation, combining mechanics and story in a subtle way, although it’s a tad awkward to think of life like mathematics. There are two big criticisms that I have, which is that the most useful attribute is that of charisma (because you can sweet talk anyone to convince them to your side and most of the time, you’ll be chatting in this game) and your teammates (depending on their specialty) can replace the missing attributes that a situation asks from you. That’s why most of the time I took Blitz because he could easily hack anything that my character couldn’t.\n\nThis standalone expansion also improves the UI significantly. Although it places an awkward “directional pad-like” UI on the right bottom corner, almost like it was meant to be ported to a console. Hopefully, it will.\nThe AI is as good as that of XCOM: EU, no real complaints about them. They’ll be as efficient as they can be before they’re put down.\n\nThe combat gels well with the story and changes itself according to the situation of the plot thus, it keeps up with the aforementioned good pacing which makes the majority of the combat quite special and unique. Yet, there was one annoying mission that you had to chase down an enemy and at the same time, fight others, kept getting away because you were getting easily killed by other gunman. I also remember a mission where you had to go through constant groups of enemy in such a way that it felt like a sudden difficulty spike. Glad those were the only moments the game irritated me. However, if you go down, then it’s game over, even though your teammates are up. There is no permadeath aside from one mission and there isn’t an injury system from XCOM, I don’t mind that, considering you’re always limited to at max 4 characters to take you with. However, that permadeath mission might’ve made the missions ahead much more difficult than usually.\n\nXCOM: EU was good but it had its issues, like the severely restricted 2 Action Points, it did remove many little niggles like crouching behind cover but your tactics were limited. Same happens with SR: DF, you won’t get an extra action point until about the beginning of the end of the game. What’s more annoying is that you can’t control your characters in an RTS style, they all follow your character’s lead, which makes “door breachings” very awkward. So you’ll be out on the open as you breach through a door.\n\n\nGraphically it runs in the Unity engine, with low quality models but beautiful pre rendered backgrounds. Options are scarce and for some reason, the game runs terribly when you zoom out, dropping the framerate to 30 even though there was nothing special of the game. Other than that, there are no technical issues aside from the AI freezing during its turn.\n\nSo yeah… that’s Shadowrun: Dragonfall! The Bollock's Edition has 33 hours of a nicely paced RPG  with a memorable narrative and satisfactory turn-based gameplay. I recommend you play Shadowrun: Returns, it’s still worth it and if you play this first before Return, then you won’t enjoy it as much. I recommend it!","June 26, 2015","true","32.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

I even felt myself as in a crime movie playing a detective first. I read each dialogue and enjoyed it quite a lot. The NPC i talked to was charismatic enough to be involved and to be interested what they may say next. Most important, I could belive the story.\nAll this is missing in Dragonfall. From the very beginning all the tasks are of cosmic importance. The motivation of the hero is absolutely not clear. Fight such terrifying opponent to revenge for a girl you don't really care about... Hard to believe.

While it felt good and i definitely got my money's worth, I felt half the game went against the other, so to speak, or that the core mechanics in the game were bit disjointed:\n\n1) The way skill checks work in conversation feels annoying. If I don't have enough strength to pick a certain option, don't even show me that option. It feels like the game is constantly taunting you to spread your karma points around but then punishes you if you do so as that makes your character significantly less viable in combat.\n\n1a) Now i know most of the additional conv options is story fluff and only occasionally alternative objective paths/bonus goodies. Problem is showing the greyed out options shatters the illusion of choice and, by proxy, replayability. If I wouldn't see the greyed out options i would feel tempted to reroll a different character after my current playthrough just to see how certain convs play out when playing a strong decker instead of a charismatic mage. Due to seeing different options and noticing how all of them lead to the same outcome I don't feel tempted much.\n\n2) There's one optimal character build: Rifles, rifles, rifles. Long range? Carry a sniper rifle. Short range, grab an AR and then switch to a minigun. All the other weapon types are subpar compared to rifles. They tried to fix this by introducing weapon variety like tasers in the pistol group, or accuracy/different firing modes to some shotguns. Still, what's the point of tasing someone when you can unload full auto on him and kill him outright or in 2 rounds.\n\nBuffs are nice but redundant when you've cyberware and stims. Mages damage output shines only for a brief moment in the mid-game and then falls behind again. Shamans suck a bit as there's only a handful useful conjuring spells and spirits are too unreliable unless you pick the creator totem (which is one of the few useful totems in the game, by the way). Deckers are plain bad and matrix segments don't really justify having them around if you ignore story fluff. Riggers scale weirdly but are still worse than other choices and if the drones are gone they're dead weight. Melee is lacklustre.\n\nSeriously, I played through this game on hard and had a feeling all the time that having four runners with miniguns/sniper rifles/grenades would steamroll through everything there is in the game without issue. Also would feel like playing Syndicate.\n\n3) The party system is very restrictive and, what adds insult to injury, the game capitalises on these restrictions to work around basic design flaws outlined in point 2 which never should've been there in the first place.\n\nUltimately I'd say the game's got lots of soul backed by great visuals, great music and a solid storyline but the PnP->cRPG translation is pretty bad which effects in a poor party system, basically non-existent loot system, poor character development and poor combat (although it did get considerably improved compared to Dead Man's Switch so kudos where they're due).\n\nDon't get me wrong, it all works, and it gets the job done and ultimately the game is quite enjoyable - but when HBS start working on a sequel they should go back to the drawing board and rethink the way they want to do it from scratch. The whole team is there, what you need is a proper systems designer.","October 21, 2014","true","51.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","2"

Also more missions and stuff apparently but i cant tell, never played the expansion version. Id say get the standalone.\n\nGameplaywise its all good. Combat is more or less the same but in terms of missions and stuff theres a noticeable evolution. Depending on your skills, things you did before, guys you got with you or even by just doing something in the world (down to just looking at a picture) which can open up dialogue choices without skill checks you can solve situations in different ways and get different outcomes. Doesnt need to shy away from the Fallouts and Arcanum in that regard.\n\nThis time around you get a fixed crew which you can also outfit to a certain degree (still can hire runners - i guess those dudes would have unique dialogues and such too and theyre not that expensive anymore but ehhh), they also get their own little story quest if you care enough - which you should, even if its just for the upgrades they get as a result.\n\nCons :\n- yet again feels abit confined, altho theres loads of stuff to do (id say you can clock a good 20 hours). Really wish there was an overworld like in the old SNES game where you could run around and shoot up random dudes for monies instead of just the Hub. Purely subjective of course, this way you really get a "tailormade" experience instead of instanced loot dungeons. I wouldnt have minded a few loot dungeons but yeah, subjective.\n- leads to : yet again so many shinies to buy and so little moneys, moreso since you now can give stuff to your dudes. I guess its for balance reasons but you get OP anyway?\n- leads to : to counter that the game introduces new layers of difficulty on the normal combat towards the end like timed objectives and then split objectives and then finally both at the same time. I guess its for varieties sake so you dont just have more and more mooks thrown at you; i found that hugely annoying and would have preferred more mooks. Yet again subjective tho.\n\nIn conclusion, great stuff any negatives i could bring up are purely subjective.

The personal Quests of you followers are interesting, and add to the setting in fantastic ways.

I personally can recommend this game to anyone who always wanted to try Shadowrun or any good RPG. It is ideal for anyone and any audience, experts, casual gamers, beginners and also shows how much Harebrained has evolved since Shadowrun Returns (which also was a fantastic game).

An Irreverend Opinions look into Shadowrun: Dragonfall - Director's Cut.\n\n---\n\nThe Blurb\nIt is the dark future of the post-awakened world.  Magic is now a thing people have to not only accept, but deal with - along with multinational corporations taking over everything, and the collapse of the usual political scene.  In the midst of all of this, the anarchist free state of Berlin comes under an extreme threat after a run into a rich manor goes horribly wrong.  Turn-based tactical shooter RPG where choices do really impact the story.\n\nThe Good\nAn interface to die for.  Everything is pretty much self-explanatory, from moving to swapping weapons in mid combat, to how skills are increased.  The layout is just as easily interpreted, allowing players to make easy decisions to what they would like to do in order to achieve their goal.\n\nMultiple paths to achieve the goal, allowing for versatile approaches to the same target objectives - from bullying others and blowing enemies away, to sneaking by in a clandestine fashion, to simply convincing your enemies that you're actually meant to be there.\n\nHaving improved on Shadowrun: Returns, the team has now managed to expand even further on their storytelling skills, and the plot not only differentiates depending on decisions you make, but how you make them.  NPCs and companions can have permanent repercussions as a result of this.\n\nThe lore of the game world is also just as rich, with plenty of details about what has occurred throughout the new history, which also lends to the storytelling as it can change how certain decisions might be made.\n\nAs eminently moddable as it's predecessor, Shadowrun: Dragonfall comes with the ability to not only craft your own modules for the improvement of the game, but it is also an extremely simple matter to be able to get access to community-released content through the Workshop.\n\nGraphics are fun and evocative, with a 'paperback detective novel' feel.  The world is highly detailed, giving flavor to the encounters and a distinct impression of what the characters have had to learn to endure.\n\nA slew of personal customization options exist, allowing for more unique characters than most games.  Further options (dress style, weapons, etc) can be picked up as the game progresses.\n\nThe AI has been greatly improved, both in terms of companion decisions and enemy actions, leading to a much more intricate puzzle to unlock.\n\nIncreasing the difficulty does not just increase enemy hitpoints, but can change up the type of encounters, the size of them, and what is expected for a 'success'.\n\nThe Bad\nDragonfall's sound and music quality is a little underwhelming, though hardly a priority as the game can easily be played with your personal music player of choice in the background.  The game's sound effects are harder to replace, but are workable without breaking immersion.\n\nCharacter companions can sometimes be poorly equipped (Looking at you, Blitz) with lackluster performance thanks to terrible skill and stat priorities.  While this can be somewhat corrected by improving their gear, the split for the player's character is either "full support" or "ignore the rest of the team and be superman".\n\nThe system's method of handling decking means that players will have to handle two maps separately.  Unfortunately, that's just a flaw in the basic game system (Shadowrun ruleset), and not something that can be easily fixed.\n\nThe Ugly\nGame will sometimes crash out, or freeze, needing a game restart to fix.\n\nLikewise, on occasions decker characters (the game's term for 'hackers') will be unable to interact with anything while in the net, making the game then require a restart to fix - unless it happens again and again.  A short workaround for this involves opening the character's personal sheet and closing it again, though this does not work for every player.\n\nSuggestions\nSome small work can be done on the bugs, but otherwise a very well-polished game.\n\nSound quality could be improved, but is hardly essential.\n\nThe Summary\n10/10, would play again.  And have.  Shadowrun: Dragonfall is a must-have for fans of sci-fi, roleplaying games, and tactical shooters.  Looking forward to the proposed release of Shadowrun: Hong Kong.\n\n---\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","July 20, 2015","true","53.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Here are some of said faults to beware:\n\n-The interface is cleaner while somehow less helpful, causing plenty of times where you forget to use worthwhile abilities or items due to how it is laid out.\n-As with the original Dragonfall, you still cannot strategically get set up before opening a door--in Dead Man's Switch, you could activate combat without enemies around to get set, and in the original Dragonfall, this was removed.  It is still gone, which eliminates much strategy potential.\n-Moving diagonally adjacent to objects or characters is still damn near impossible, further eliminating strategy potential.\n-You still cannot access several decking points with Blitz as Harebrained really wants you to be a samurai decker, breaking continuity and making Blitz kinda pointless in those instances since you are required to sacrifice a better companion just to bring him for his decking.\n-This game has some weird caching which did not exist in the original.  The longer that you play, the longer that your load screens are.  This is per session, and not related to the size of your save file like Skyrim's caching is.  Since this game is so NOT hardware intensive, there is no excuse to have three- to five-minute loading screens (on my beast of a computer, no less) with a game which I could run on a smartphone.  The loading screens at launch made it unplayable for me since I favour quicksaving and quickloading.  Obviously, those load times are by no means "quick."  This was allegedly fixed, according to Harebrained, but know that it was only hidden:  You now have a black screen as a buffer on either end of the load screen, which is a loading screen in and of itself.  The DISPLAYED loading screen is shorter, but the loading times altogether are unimproved.\n-You can still miss many, many times in a row with 99% accuracy because of the disparity between displayed hit percentages and actual in-game numbers.  There is no such thing as 99% accuracy still.\n\nDragonfall DC has new content, which is always nice, but I feel like the new content was paraded to disguise the fact that game-breaking and fun-ruining bugs were never addressed.  If you ever became frustrated with poor design from the first Dragonfall, especially after playing the more QC'd Dead Man's Switch, you will once again potentially ragequit.  I assure you, the new content is not worth the irritation again if you hated it the first time around since you were able to get all of the context that you need for the new content in the original via dialogue, anyway.  I recommend it because I wholeheartedly support the Cyberpunk genre, as flawed as Shadowrun is in a pure Cyberpunk sense, and because I personally like turn-based RPGs.  Just know that this game has some major problems which will never be addressed by the lazy developers if you pick it up.\n\nOddly enough, the rash of cheap games on Steam inspired by the modern Shadowrun (Transistor, Satellite Reign, etc) are far less frustrating since they seem to have all learned to not make the same design mistakes in copying the formula.","December 15, 2014","true","59.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I don't remember the tiers, but there was one that included the "planned Berlin campaign" and a snazzy USB key. That's the one I got. I greatly enjoyed SRR on release, I wrote a glowing review on it and I was pleased as is, especially with both a campaign and the tools to make my own (which I keep meaning to do).\n\nSRR and its initial campaign, Deadman's Switch, were fantastic. Dragonfall, however, is the fulfillment of all the hopes I had for this platform. The writing is miles above the previous campaign, which was already quite decent. The main NPCs - the Kreusbazar crew - are extremely fleshed out, very relatable and rarely (if ever) step out of character. The plot itself, while not "mind-bending" or whatever other cliche epithets people like to attach to these things, is semi-original but that's irrelevant because the execution is nearly flawless. Nearly. The sidequests for your fellow Shadowrunners (including the additions in this Director's Cut) are entertaining and further serve to get you attached to your people. The expanded cyberware selection in the DC is also incredibly welcome, because that's one area where Shadowrun Returns was fairly lackluster.\n\nThe interface improvements, while not a massive overhaul, are welcome and make the game that much easier to manipulate and play. The use of additional etiquette types in actual gameplay makes investing karma into Charisma actually worthwhile this time around, instead of being a guessing game as to what actually sees any significant use.\n\nIf you enjoyed Shadowrun Returns, enjoy cyberpunk plots, enjoy good characterization and fun tactical gameplay then Shadowrun: Director's Cut is well worth every last penny. Even though I got it for free as part of my backing the project, I WOULD have paid extra for it.","December 2, 2014","true","19.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Plays simular to X-com.\n-Customizable character that totally changes the playthrough based on your preferences.\n-Strong replay value.\n-User generated content to extend playtime\n- Longer, more fine tuned than the original which was also a fun game imo\n\nIssues:\n-No Char import by default(can turn on by using the provided editor but is clunky)\n- No stealh options in a game about shadow runners.\n- Enivornments looks great, char and weapon textures defintely lacking\n-Default difficulty is pretty easy, need to crank it up to really get tested.\n\nIf you liked the original game at all, then you will love this one.","December 2, 2014","true","30.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The Karma System allows for countless costumisation of your main character, the new levelling system for your followers add a valuable factor, as you can skill them in anyway you need to complement your main character. The personal Quests of you followers are interesting, and add to the setting in fantastic ways. This game allows the player to fully immerse himself in the world of Shadowrun, to experience this setting, bringing us so close to what Shadowruns actually means, that I could often enough smell and taste the Berlin of that time. I personally can recommend this game to anyone who always wanted to try Shadowrun or any good RPG. It is ideal for anyone and any audience, experts, casual gamers, beginners and also shows how much Harebrained has evolved since Shadowrun Returns (which also was a fantastic game). I am personally looking forward to seeing more of Harebrained and must personally thank them for giving us a new giant in the RPG genre that can compete with cult-titles like Baldur's Gate any day!","October 25, 2014","true","29.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"
