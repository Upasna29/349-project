I especially love using the conductor spell, which allows you to move everything in front of you with a wave of your hands. Really felt cool. It would be nice to see some more gateways added, unless there's some I haven't found. I was able to find three. There's a light amount of dropped frames on my r9 290 which is a bummer.

The result is a mesmerizing experience that has had me come back multiple times just to mess around with all the items in the room.\n\nThere is so much that goes on in the tower and so many little “hidden” secrets that I often got distracted (in a good way) from making all the spells.  However, I do feel that there is also a lot of untapped potential here (especially for people with larger play areas) with all the unused items in the room. (or maybe I just haven’t figured out how to use them yet!)  It would be amazing to see some of the various trinkets and artifacts be used elsewhere in the room to unlock new areas or abilities.\n\nAs it stands, Waltz of the Wizard is a fantastic experience and is of an amazing quality for a freebie.  It truly makes you feel a bit like Mickey in the Sorcerer’s Apprentice and it genuinely captures the feeling of actually wielding magical powers!\n\n10/10, will play again!\n","May 31","true","4.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The result is a mesmerizing experience that has had me come back multiple times just to mess around with all the items in the room.\n\nThere is so much that goes on in the tower and so many little “hidden” secrets that I often got distracted (in a good way) from making all the spells.  However, I do feel that there is also a lot of untapped potential here (especially for people with larger play areas) with all the unused items in the room. (or maybe I just haven’t figured out how to use them yet!)  It would be amazing to see some of the various trinkets and artifacts be used elsewhere in the room to unlock new areas or abilities.\n\nAs it stands, Waltz of the Wizard is a fantastic experience and is of an amazing quality for a freebie.  It truly makes you feel a bit like Mickey in the Sorcerer’s Apprentice and it genuinely captures the feeling of actually wielding magical powers!\n\n10/10, will play again!\n","May 31","true","4.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you have a Vive then do not pass up this title. What a great sandbox showing what great things we can do for the VIVE. I would personally like to thank the developers for spending their time and effort making this and donating it to the community for Free. Has to be one of the best free titles out right now. The reviews speak for themselves though it would appear that 1 in every 100 reviewers are stupid and ungrateful. They should be thrown in a cauldron and turned into frog spawn soup.
