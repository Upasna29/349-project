Not even single bug or lack of vital features such as rebind of buttons was patched during entire year, because they simply dropped PC version and focused on PS4! And they BANNED ME for this review, what a scammers! Its not even betrayal! Its a fraud! Just watch this video:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4EX9udkmEU\n\n\nI suggest everyone to contact Valve support and Gaben personally about this fraud case and request refund as well as ban of this game from steam store until it will be finished, to stop feeding PS4 development with PC user's money.\n\nIn business practice they sort of took money from one investor and spent those money for making business for another potential investor and gave no crack about their first inverstors.\n\nSo basically THEY STOLE OUR MONEY and run away doing job for someone else. They will probably return with half ♥♥♥♥♥ PS4 port month after  they will ship PS4 version, and will pretend like they are nice and always cared about us, but we who paid first was just used and will play full game last in the list, they dont freaking care about us, about their duty.\n\nHow about we all do mass steam refunds despite we played more than 2 hours?  How about we ask Valve to shut down sales of this game on steam to stop this fraud and teach devs a lesson of fair business practice? How about we sue them?\n\nThis is freaking unacceptable! If they took our money we must be prioritzed and they must deliver content and updates to us 1st, and only when they finish with us they may start working for someone else, but instead they just used us and our money without our awareness of shady development of PS4 version prioritized, still without exact date when this game will be finished on PC!\n\nIf they was not working on PS4 version they would way faster finish PO episodes and will release at least such a vital PC updates like ONE VERY REQUESTED THAT ADDS ABILITY TO REBIND BUTTONS AND MOVES CAMERA CONTROL FROM KEYBOARD TO MOUSE, to make this game less clunky and actually playable. But they decided its good ide to bite the hand that feeds them.\n\nːsteamsadː\n\nDevelopers like this, no matter how good their games are, deserves to face ultimate punishment such a bankrupcy, ban from stores like steam and mass refunds.\n\nIn addition:\n\nAI beyond stupid, stealth beyond primitive, controls beyond clunky (some "GENIUS" decided it would be good idea to use digital keyboard keys to rotate camera, instead of using analogue mouse, also hell lot of interfaces not even support mouse input and you have to use keyboard with poor layout. gamepad support is non existent), interface beyond immersion breaking (omni view set world on pause within x-ray mode, maybe on mobile it was good but for pc they should have made it real time without x-ray view to add some challenge and improve immersion, at least option should exist to turn that ugly things off), absolutely no challenge and reason to play, except for story, but its not very engaging with such unchallenging primitive stealth gameplay and very clunky controlls and immersion breaking UI.\n\nAlso this game just copied (quite dumbed down and casual way) concept of innovative and absolutely immersive and challenging Expirience 112 COMPLETE game with more engaging story and proper mouse controls, so if you looking for something similar i suggest you to buy it instead of Republique, right here:\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/324770/\n\nUpdate:\n\nAnd here how they excuse such an antimcustomer actions as bans for negative reviews:\nYou have been permanently banned from all Republique discussions.\nYou were banned by a Republique developer.\nReason: "posting false and inflammatory information"\n\n- yeah, "right". not just quote post does not have anything they claim, It was them who fed us with FALSE INFORMATION entire year, and instead of giving apology they just banned me for thuth about their lies and they hide thread about this away from customers, to keep fraud going. And they did not left reply here in comments to review, where they cant ban me or delete this review! Wow, and i supported these scamdevs, and recommended people in my MGS \ Stealth and gaming communities to support devs on kickstarter and pre-order this game,   (shame i was not aware how it will turn out, if only i knew how bad stealth ai and gameplay are and that game would be half-baked for about year i would not recommend anyone to pre-order it).\n\nThe only good thing about it - once they spotted by public, they will try typical damage control maybe even will start to care more about PC version, to make all of this look like false, like they always cared about PC version and never used our financial support without our awareness to abandon PC development and focus on PS4 and like they never lied about state of game - which was early access to begin with, and like they never lied about release date of next episodes, that will "come out soon" instead of saying truth " sorry guys, we dont care about pc version much and focused on PS4, once we will finish it, we will probably return to you with half ♥♥♥♥♥ port, but for now dont expect anything from us, not even vital patch, for about entire year".\n\nSure, ban your loyal customers for negative reviews and keep liying, instead of giving apology and saying truth! Way to gain sales for this and new games from your company, which i and a lot of people will never support again after bahavior like this! Will report to Valve and Gaben personally about this, steam should have less developers who sells half of game and runs away with money and then tries to silence anyone who spotted them.\n\nUpdate 2:\nLol, i just found out that they DELETED EVERY OF MY POSTS IN EVERY THREAD, including those about controls and ai problems with suggestions how to fix them that i posted like almost year ago. That was pathetic overkill, like a personal vendeta. Valve really should not allow devs to permaban and delete anything without Valve approval, because some of them abusing power and banning \ deleting against Steam rules, like Republique dev did.\nAlso just look at forums - they was locking every thread where people asked about EP4 and patches , they was definetly trying to silence people who dicsussed uncomfortable subjects, no other threads was locked.\n\nLooks like this dev using fraud techniques since iOs version, which also was abandoned without ep 4 and 5, and it was release back in 2013 there! 2 years and ios pps still waiting! Can you see the picture? They start game for one platform, make part of it, take money from people expecting full game, and abandoning platform for new that has fresh consumers to pay for unfinished game.\n\nAs for dev statement that PS4 version developed by 3rd party - sounds like lie to me! Judge  yourself - shady behavior on 2 platforms + how come PS4 already has 5 episodes finished, by 3rd party dev, while in-house PC ver ep4-5 still not finished?\n\nIn trailer nobody mentions (not even logo in credits) 3rd party studio and they claim they spent best part of year in-house on PS4 version and that episodes for it are ready:\n\nOriginally posted by Camouflaj:After 3 years of development we have readied all 5 episodes of the game packaged together in one epic long-form epxpirience on Playstation 4. We spent better part of the year re-imagining game to work with the DualShock 4 controller. We developed console-friendly UI and all-new cover system and implemented hundreds of tiny fixes under the hood to make Republique on PS4 the most seamless experience possible\nTime paradox? It cant be! Lie? Lie!

It will be updated with each episode.\n\nRepublique casts you as a fly on the wall; a ghost in the machine, given immense power over your adversaries even as you remain distant, unsure for what purpose you’ve been called on.\n\nResiding in the security cameras of a totalitarian society of Metamorphosis, you act as the eyes and ears of Hope, a brave but uninformed resistance fighter attempting to break free of the government's constant surveillance. Your instructions are her only hope for escaping “recalibration”, a punishment for those caught reading the resistance propaganda left behind by the recently executed Daviel Zagar, and through the lenses of the city’s prying electric eyes help free it from the control an all-seeing police state.\n\nEasy comparisons can be drawn between Republique and its clear inspiration from the likes of 1984, but unlike many of its contemporaries its world isn’t just an easily unnerving shell for its narrative, but the point at which the entire game pivots. Developer Camouflaq has invested fully in its haunting near future view of a fully controlled and monitored city, every hall lined with cameras, phone lines and computers tapped in case of a potential uprising, and patrols stationed at every point in the city, and molded them into its camera hopping stealth gameplay in a way that wouldn’t be possible with a different setting.\n\nRepublique’s devotion to keeping the player aware of their position within the world as a disconnected entity traveling through its electronics, but not a physical all-powerful being, is what makes it so easy to buy into the reality it puts before you. Though you have a significant advantage from the viewpoint of a wall-mounted camera, you’re still at the mercy of their positioning and the signal of Hope’s phone. It’s a subtle but important element in projecting the city’s continued control over its citizens, and in making the moments where you can do nothing but sit and watch Hope fend for herself that much more affecting.\n\nBeing fixed inside the city’s connected networks also allows you to learn more about it independent of Hope, by snooping inside emails or zooming in on the documents carelessly left lying around. The different pieces all provide small insights into what life is like within Metamorphosis, with censored recordings, doctored newspapers, and the perpetual discomfort and dread buried in the writings its citizens. With how much of it reads as disturbingly similar to the always connected state we all live our lives in, the possibility of Metamorphosis being a potential future gives it credence in ways that had me investing in Hope’s freedom that much more.\n\nIt’s world is so brilliantly executed in fact that it becomes a liability to far less exceptional stealth gameplay, which served as a frustratingly consistent reminder that, yes, I am indeed playing a video game. It spends so much time building a believable setting that being told I needed to upgrade Hope’s phone, or collect intel to buy upgrades with, pulled me out of the experience as its very traditional “game” elements tried their damndest to disrupt the credibility of its narrative. Watching guards patrol awkwardly along absurdly impractical routes or refusing to follow me through doors felt more artificial than they’ve ever been, and made me rather annoyed anytime I’d stumble upon them while attempting to immerse myself in an environment that kept pushing me out.\n\nMuch of this though could be the result of Republique’s move from smartphones to PC. Though the graphics and control have been improved, all the subtle contextual features tailored toward mobile (such as everything existing within a call, or watching firmware updates and receiving texts) ring hollow when presented on a platform they so clearly don’t belong on. I can’t really fault the game for it, as I’m not sure how they could have reworked it so as to fit on a new platform, but it does result in an experience that isn’t nearly as clever in how it presents itself.\n\nRepublique’s first episode is both incredibly successful at selling its world and the potential its narrative begins to touch on, and at breaking it down by inserting outdated gameplay elements that stand out among its otherwise impeccable vision. I’m no less interested in seeing where Republique goes with future episodes, but I’m certainly much more cautious of how they decide to get there. There’s the makings of something incredibly at the heart of Republique, but it could all start to fall apart if it doesn’t begin to pay more attention to how it's pulling itself apart from the inside.\n\nEpisode 2: Metamorphosis Update\n\nDespite what the closing events of episode one might seem to imply, the second act of Republique isn’t a chaotic narrative progression, but an extended look into Metamorphosis as a city and it’s creator, the unnamed overseer. Placing you within the city’s library, exposition comes in the form of commentary on certain banned books by the self obsessed dictator of Metamorphosis, which serves to delve into the ideological framework it was built upon and the overseer’s incessant attempts to control every thought and action of its citizens.\n\nIt’s a fascinatingly grand and consistent exploration of city built and run on the beliefs of a single man, so confident in his ideas he deems himself the only one capable of leading the world out of the darkness it supposedly resides in. Though there is never an attempt to paint Metamorphosis as anything but invasive and inhumane, the scarce logic in the overseer’s creation provides it the thread of believability so often missing from the artificial worlds of most games.\n\nSave the original Bioshock, I doubt I’ve ever played a game whose world is so intrinsically wrapped in the ideology of its architec. Bioshock’s Rapture was designed on the basis of complete freedom from law and natural limitations, while Republique’s Metamorphosis posits the inverse; a police state of surveillance and censorship, built-in the image and for the glorification of one person and the godlike wisdom they feel they possess.\n\nEpisode two of Republique hasn’t fixed the issues of the first, that being the poor stealth and poorly contextualized mechanics, but it has built up and expanded on the areas it was already strong at. In only a few hours Metamorphosis and the key players within it have been developed into complicated, intriguing characters which in themselves are so compelling that I have no qualms recommending the game for its lore and narrative along. I’ve yet to given up hope that Republique’s stealth aspects will become more fleshed out and engaging as time goes on, but regardless developer Camoglaj has got me hooked wherever the game intends to take me.\n\nEpisode 3: Ones and Zeroes Update\n\nSecrets. Secrets and lies. Lies and motives and distorting the truth to get what we need. For the first two episodes of Republique the line between sides and who you could trust had remained clean. Characters could be sympathetic and understandable whatever they believed, but they never wavered on those beliefs, and nor did I on where they ultimately stood. Episode 3: Ones and Zeroes changes that.\n\nEpisode 4: God's Acre Update\n\nRepublique’s 4th episode has been a long time coming. Just a few days shy of 14 months to be exact, and stepping back into the world of Republique after so much time it's hard not to feel as if the delay has taken its toll.\n\nUnfortunately I've reached the character limit for Steam reviews and can't publish my full update. If you would like to read it in its entirety you can find it on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].\nFull disclosure: Republique Remastered is being reviewed using a copy provided by the developer.","February 26, 2015","true","16.0"," 200 of 245 people (82%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","82","200","245","8","11"

I thought the mobile port to a PC would never be this good. Considering the last thing we got from iOS/Android, besides numerous "casual" games, was the dreadful Deus Ex: The Fall, I didn't have too much hopes on this one. But, I was wrong. This game, although quite point-and-click like, still provides intense stealth action with very immersing story line. Sure, the graphic isn't top notch, but it provides working game mechanics, intense plot, and quite creative puzzles in each episodes. I can't wait till they finish episode 4 and 5, because I am just dying to know what the climax and grand finale of this game would be.\n\nPlus, the bonus in this game is very nice. You will hear everything that is needed to understand this world. It's ture that there are some silly advertisements placed for indie games, but again, it's just knit picking. But all the recordings you find are very good at explaining the situation you are in, and how the world in this game is like.\n\nSmall complaints though: sometimes the camera is placed in very weird places, so the control of your character can be clunky. As a result, you will get spotted by the "Prizrak" quite few times. But it doesn't happened too often, and considering that's somewhat intentional, I can forgive that. Also, I personally think that this game somewhat rips off from both 1984 and Bioshock Infinite, as the main antagonist, the overseer, seems to be the clone of comstock and the society, or the republique, is exactly what 1984 is.\n\nAnyways, it's a very good game, and if you like immersive storytelling game with stealth mechanics, this is definitely the winner. Go try it yourself!\n\np.s. those who prefer fast stealthy games should not expect a good stealth action from this game. Plus, as of right now game is bit stubby, as each episode lasts around 2-3 hours. So you are getting about 6-9 hour experience and promise of additional 4-6 hours more.","February 26, 2015","true","12.4"," 120 of 144 people (83%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","83","120","144","7","8"

I still stand by what's written here; Republique is a lovely little game, and worth the 10~ hrs it'll take of your life. If i ever come back to the game, i'll continue the review process.\n\nOriginal Text:\n\nI was first clued in to Republique via Penny Arcade; Tycho backed the Kickstarter, and from what i've played so far he was wise to do so. Republique is an episodic stealth hacking game, and a very cerebral one at that. The gameplay is simple and streamlined; picture the camera hacks from Watch Dogs, coupled with the data collection from Deus Ex. There's a lot of flavor text and a lot of backstory, mostly told between email, voice mail, posters, and the ever-present running commentary from Cooper, a chatty ally with obscure motives. Put together, it all makes for a very nice, very compact adventure.\n\nI intend to update this review after playing each episode, but if you're the TL:DR type, the short answer is yes, you should play Republique, if only to say that you have.\n\nEPISODE ONE\n\n... is rather cutscene heavy. This is the introduction to the dystopian world Republique occupies, so the cinematic format is forgivable. From the Headmaster ranting over the PA system to the collectible "banned books" you can find throughout, this game reads like Bradbury's Farenheit 451 come to life; censorship, despotism, and thought control are running themes, and the story is better for their presence. You play as a (so far) nameless entity assisting a young teen named Hope, and will guide her through the halls of an ultramodern dormitory of sorts.\n\nAlong the way, you'll find plenty of items, some of which are collectibles, and others which are more combat centered; understand, however, that combat in this game is simply Hope either tasing or macing the patrolling enemies, usually after being spotted and grappled by them. There's no benefit to fighting every opponent, and typically a few moments of watching will show you the enemies' patrol routes and how to avoid them. There is a pickpocketing option that nets you plenty of extra loot, and as you upgrade your systems, you'll become capable of distracting the guards, mapping out their patrol routes, and even utilising a kind of sonar ping to locate them on your map.\n\nSpeaking of upgrading, it's done by finding a daemon server, which will upgrade the software you're using to assist Hope; this is primarily used to open doors and item caches, and gives you reason to revisit earlier parts of the map. To gain extra abilities, you'll need to find a Data Broker, which gives you a cash bonus for each piece of info you've acquired and then lets you choose from a short list of enhancements. Standard stuff, but done well; the upgrades feel intuitive in the HUD, and you'll find plenty of places to use whatever you purchase.\n\nThe game offers the usual options for graphics, though there's a few hitches in the cutscenes, most noticably in the lip syncing and during bursts of static. While annoying, these are in no way gamebreaking, and i imagine there's already a patch being worked on. I didn't encounter any other glitches; there's been an obvious amount of polishing on this port, and the game is better for it.\n\nThe art style is reminiscent of Deus Ex, or perhaps Bioshock's Rapture before it fell; the revolution that inevitably appears in every dystopian story hasn't fared too well here, or caused any damage to the dorms. The camera views will give you multiple POVs of practically every room and every situation, and some of those rooms (the Atrium, for instance) are grand in scale. Don't expect to spend all your time in corridors, or in dining areas. Even in the first episode, this game makes a point of organically varying your surroundings, and it's a good thing.\n\nThe voice talent for this game is impressive, featuring some AAA-level talent, and they aren't on holiday. The voice acting is one of the best parts of the game, and I strongly suggest you listen to every voice over and every comment.\n\nSo, Episode One. A slow burn of an introduction, but a solid start for what is bound to be a very high-brain story. I'm looking forward to this.\n\nEPISODE TWO\n\n... drops you right where you ended. You'll experience a new plot device in this chapter, where you view a camera recording to discern your next step; it's another level of immersion in an already solid presentation, but on the downside can leave you scratching your head trying to figure out which camera is the one that triggers the recording. I spent a little while longer than i should've in that first room figuring this out, but that might have less to do with the game design and more to do with my sleep deprivation. You decide.\n\nThere's a lot of flowing architecture once again, the main map being a sprawling library with three open floors. I referenced Deus Ex and Bioshock before, but i'm pleased to say the art style is starting to feel more original and less derivative. Whether it's the textures, or the audio, or even the HUD, there's an organic structure to this game that makes it more and more enjoyable dodging guards and collecting little bits of information here and there.\n\nThis is also where random patrols are introduced, and god was it needed. There's far too much predicability with the regular guards' AI. The most glaring example of this is when you're lighting up statues for a puzzle to progress the plot; there's a guard whose patrol route makes him stare at 4 of the 7 statues you can light, and no matter what you've done his reaction is the same -- he's just gonna walk back and forth until he sees you. This is more amusing than infuriating, but honestly, if you're going to have dynamic lighting, guards should react to it. What could've been a very tense game of cat-and-mouse was instead a simple question of timing and cover.\n\nStill, the story is solid here, going strong and keeping the player off balance. You have a chance to hear the leader of the resistance movement in the first episode, via cassette tapes he's left lying around for you to collect, but i didn't find one of his hideaways with a tape player in it until this episode, and i gotta say ... this guy is crazy. If you were expecting a logical, defensible series of arguments from the resistence, you're going to be disappointed. His rants, however, run true to the heart of the matter: revolution is messy, violent, and dark. You cannot defeat a suppressor with words alone.\n\nThe voice acting is still impressive here; David Hayter of MGS fame does a fabulous half-crazed revolutionary, Jennifer Hale is biting and precise as a headmistress. I keep wishing the headmaster was voiced by Simon Templeman; not because the actual voice actor fails in any way, but simply because this kind of refined cruelty is Templeman's forte. Still, there's a lot of fluidity and dynamics in the voices, and of course Cooper is still a running element in the game, dispensing advice and objectives without really stating his own intentions or place in this dystopia.\n\nDiving deeper into the series, you'll find mounting paranoia and the slow swimming feeling of despair underneath your actions, but that is to the game's credit that it makes you feel that. Keep going past the darkness of the story, and you'll find a compelling narrative that only gets stronger the deeper you go.\n\nTo be continued ...","February 26, 2015","true","5.3"," 62 of 85 people (73%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","73","62","85","6","0"

So far I'm just starting episode 2 right now and the length of each episode is quite long.\n\nThe Story is extremely immersive. What I like best about it is the presentation focuses on perspectives, ideas and vantage points alike. The main character is a faceless entity whom is perhaps a person on the outside looking in, using the very same technology meant to oppress it's citizens to help a young girl escape. I love the mood it evokes in me. Reminds me of long afternoons trying to figure out what famous novels where really trying to say, those moments as the game quotes but who quotes it escapes me, "revealing those unspoken moments we all share."\n\nIn time I see myself revisiting this game as the episodes come out looking forward to each one. Grateful that someone took a chance at this level to make something new.\n\nThe only con is the gameplay itself has little real consequence as if you get caught you get set back a way but not really penalized. I started to play far more aggressively once I realized the bottom was a nick not a reset. My one only real complaint, thus far.","February 28, 2015","true","29.1"," 40 of 57 people (70%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","70","40","57","5","1"

In the beginning, you get drawn into the gameplay and story. I fell in love with the direction that this game was going in the beginning with finding clues and meeting other people who are trying to help you along the way. It gave me a "hunger games" feel with the character trying to escape. The game is extremely good between episode 1 thru 3. When episode 4 came out it was extremely short and did not bring anything new to how the game was good in the first place. It really felt lackluster and left me with alot of questions. The last episode left me with even MORE questions than i had with episode 4. It might be possible that they are going to make another series of this but I highly doubt it. If you are interested in this game, just play episodes 1 thru 3. 4 and 5 will leave you saying, "What did I just play for half an hour?" I really wish they would further explain what was going on at the end. I wanted to rate this game a high score but due to the last two episodes not living up to the first three, I would have to give it at least a 6/10.

The art and sound is great considering the target platform. The voice acting can be quite cringey at times. What annoyed me the most was probably the sub-par motion capture acting.

It turns out that taking a year to create a well-crafted PC version is actually worth it, because this game looks, feels, and plays as if it were made for PC from scratch.

You hop on different camera angles and sometimes on her mobile phone to change perspective and view.\n\nThe difficulty is almost non-existent though, yes you can try to sneak past to the guards pickpocketing them along the way, but if you get caught, you are only put to a holding cell like a kid in detention/corner but can easily get out there. The only time I felt pressured was on the last chapter.\n\nFor the Story, it is quite interesting and climaxes at chapter 3, chapter 4 slows down a bit to give you some insight and clues on what is really happening and chapter 5 just reveals the whole perspective of the whole earth in this fictional world.\n\nThe ending has a twist and has garnered mixed opinions on the players. I think it is quite naïve on the first glance, but If you think about it, the devs wanted to give a deeper meaning behind the ending.\n\nGameplay: 8/10\nGraphics/Sound: 9/10\nStory: 6/10\n\nDespite the disappointing ending, I'm still going to recommend this game just for the gameplay, artstyle and the setting. If you want a happy ending, stop @ chapter 3 and try to only get the game @ 50% sale price.\n\nIf you did go past EP.3, the total length is around 20 hours with all achievements completed (My playthrough is quite on the long side).

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aldershot/recommended/317100/","aldershot","[F!] Aldershot","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aldershot/","2454 products in account","Below you'll find a written and video impression on the game\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX4D3h668d0\n\nRepublique is an interesting take on the stealth genre. It mixes some point and click sensibilities with classic stealth and puzzle elements. All presented in a polished and expertly crafted world.\n\nIn Republique, you don't control the girl exactly, rather, you're a 3rd party entity that can control the cameras in the world, as well as any other electronic device. You'll be task to guide the girl through the game, through simple point and click commands, while having the ability to hack devices to your advantage. The fact that you see through the camera's perspective makes for some interesting gameplay. Being able to jump from camera to camera, allowing you to scout ahead of the girl for potential danger is one that's pretty fresh. Couple that with the hacking abilities and that it's a point and click, Republique has some fresh and interesting ideas for the stealth genre.\n\nThough I did find the gameplay and stealth satisfying I think it's only fair I also mention that it's was also not the most challenging stealth game I've ever played. Because the girl is controlled mostly by an AI, with you serving only as a guide to her destination, I feel that the enemy AI has been scaled back in order to compensate. The enemy AI isn't the greatest, often missing the girl sneaking right next to them. But as mentioned before, due to the way the game was designed, this is some what understandable, but does come with a cost to the game's overall challenge level. For those who are really into stealth games, this could be perceived as a negative, but for those who are new to the genre, or like easier going games, this could be considered "accessible". How you feel about this will be very subjective.\n\nRepublique features some impressive visuals, taking full advantage of Unity 5's technology, and leaning on the team's professional background. The aesthetics are wonderfully designed, with expertly crafted models and textures, and lighting that would make Hollywood jealous. There's also some great voice over work with well known actors in the game industry. Presentation wise, I have little to no complaints about Republique. It's polished, it's professional, and it has a ton of style.\n\nThere's a lot to like about Republique but it's not perfect. The story of the game, with as little spoilers as possible, is one of a dystopian setting. It has all the classic elements, oppression, unreasonable mass surveillance, the lost of personal identity, hell it even has some book burning involved. I usually am a sucker for dystopian stories but I found Republique's to be rather cliche, offering very little new to the genre. I've played through ep 1-3 (whats currently available as of this impression) and it just repeats the same tropes that every one have seen a thousand times over in other dystopian tales. Even the characters in the game are weak with out much development. The story of the game was my biggest point of contention. Not necessarily because it was bad, but because it was incredibly average. I'm hoping that the future installments of ep. 4-5 will fix this issue, though I feel 1-3 was weak from a narrative stand point.\n\nRepublique overall is a strong and interesting entry into the stealth and point and click genre. If you're a fan of either of those types of games, I think Republique is worth checking out. It offers a lot of fresh ideas, and a polished to a shine presentation. If you're looking for an original and engrossing dystopian tale, Republique may disappoint, but because of how interesting and how high quality the other elements that make up Republique, I would still recommend checking it out if you have the chance.\n\nPros:\n- Professional quality presentation\n- Unique and interesting ideas for both the point and click and stealth genre\n- Accessible\n\nCons:\n- Cliche story\n- Could be considered overly forgiving in challenge","May 17, 2015","true","12.3"," 8 of 16 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","8","16","0","0"

But because you are "also" the man in the surveillance room, you can operate the cameras to foresee guards and obstacles for her ..and of course open doors..That's what I call a dynamic duo.\n\nMusic 7.5 of 10\nThe music didn't impress me that much ..just solid ambient sound..Nothing too breathtaking.\n\nStory :\nYou are the invisible man behind the cameras. And as you receive the call for help from subject 390-H you decide to help her. But how ?? You follow her on the surveillance cameras you find the guards and obstacles so she won't be caught.As she is no fighter, you have to protect her by guiding her safely through this huge building. But as the game is not yet finished, there's still 2 more episodes to come, I can't really say too much about the story .\n\nFinal Verdict:\nRecommended for all adventure-stealth gamers, who are looking for a new experience. And are willing to wait for 2 more episodes..","August 18, 2015","true","1.5"," 26 of 52 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","26","52","2","0"

If you don't cry a little at the end of Chapter 3, well, you may not have a soul. The story is just that good.\n\nThe simple "point-and-click" controls are reminiscent of later Kings Quest games which means that your grandmother could play this. But don't think that means Republique will be a walk in the park! The guards are smart, the puzzles are intriguing, and there are several places off the beaten path to explore. BRILLIANT voice acting by Rena Strober, Jennifer Hale, David Hayter, Khary Payton, and Dwight Schultz make this a must buy for me. (I'm a sucker for good voice acting, what can I say?)\n\nI played this on my Android, and I had a blast, but I want you to understand: This is no mere phone port. The graphics have been upgraded to take full advantage of the Unity 5 engine, and it shows. The new cinematics are amazing, and the environments really benefit from the new lighting and textures. I was happy to see that this came to PC, but wasn't sure about the price. But I took a risk, and I'm glad I did. It was totally worth it.

Doing some maths tells me there are six more hours of gameplay. Color me Impressed.\n\nReview of République Remastered\nGameplay\nI am not sure where to start, to be honest. République Remastered is a point-n-click stealth game, played entirely by guiding around a character point-n-click style while viewing the environment and rooms through various cameras installed at every corner. Imagine Watch_Dogs camera hacking system, except in good and as a full game. Perspective can be changed at any time, as long as there is another camera close by to take control of.\n\nThe stealth system works reasonably well. Enemies have a cone of sight and can hear footsteps if you are running. You can lure them away by activating telephones and speakers or disable them by means of either pepper spray or tazers which are just rare enough that you would rather save them for important bits. Doors can be hacked in order to shut enemies in - or out.\n\nThe character you control moves slow but very smooth and tries to stay in cover as long as a command allows for it.  Minus points for the missing feedback when clicking on items that can be picked up. On the upside, picking up items always triggers a verbal response from the protagonist once the item is in the inventory.\n\nI have only played the first two chapters, but so far I have not encountered a puzzle I wasn't able to solve within a reasonable time frame. In addition, you can't lose at this game. If you get cought, you get escorted to the next interrogation room which you need to break out of in order to proceed. Interrogation rooms serve as shops to upgrade your hacking abilities as well as recharge station for your battery which is needed for hacking. Think of interrogation rooms as your classical save room - having said that, saving itself is done automatically. As you might imagine, I don't find this game very hard. Moving around undetected and solving puzzles in the meantime is just challenging enough to keep me both focused and interested.\n\nGraphics\nThe game was developed using the Unity 5 engine. "Uh, Unity" I can hear some of you moan already, but hold your horses for a second. This game does not look bad at all. It is not the crisp and shiny that we are used to from triple A games, but it stands it's ground. Apart from some blurry textures on close up camera shots I haven't really found a point I would like to complain about. My conclusion: Solid work.\n\nAtmosphere - Sound & Lighting\nI don't do that very often, but here is a new category for you. I think this is important enough to talk about seperately, especially in stealth and point-n-click games and République Remastered is both. The sound design is surprisingly solid. Electronic sounds for camera and hacking and computer stuff often manages to get on my nerves, but in this game it does not. They tie in very well with the game world and your actions as a player. The same can be said for the rest of the sounds. From closing doors to the sound of a guard talking into his headset, everything feels as if it is supposed to be that way.\n\nIn addition to the sound, the lighting in this game is well done. Nothing too spectecular, no big lens flares or sun sets or optic illusions. Instead, it feels as if the lights have been placed with the idea in mind to make everything look as normal and average as you would expect it to, if you were to ever walk those rooms. Again, very solid work.\n\nConcluding this little excursion, I would say that both sound a lighting make for a great atmosphere.\n\nStory\nThe story of this game is set in a dystopian now. The protagonist girl - called "390-H" or "Hope" depending on who you ask - is trying to escape and underground building only referred to as "the facility", which seems to be her home, school and prison at the same time. You (as Hope refers to the player) are tasked with guiding her through that facility, evading the local security and making her way up to the surface. The facility is lead by a man only referred to as "overseer" or "headmaster" who, despite stating good intentions, seems to control the facility by propaganda and teaching programs, while keeping a close eye on it's inhabitants through the surveillance systems and delegating tasks to the security.\n\nSo far, the story follows an almost straight line through what I would like to call the "dystopian vally of total control". Government is oppressing people by exerting total control via propaganda and surveillance, people found resistance, protagonist finds resistence force, joins up and destroys government. Of course I can only speak for the first two chapters but the tendencies to go there are as inconspicuous as an elephant trumpeting the national hymn.\n\nHaving said that, I like Hope as a character. The game manages to make her someone that I actually want to help, and not only by scratching the forth wall like a wild animal while never breaking it fully, but also by the fact that she is struggling with almost mundane situations that most people are familiar with. Good job, République Remastered.\n\nConclusion\nNow to the question at hand: Is this game worth it's money? To that I can only say "Yes, it is". Unlike most stealth games nowadays which seem to emphasize on knocking people out or stabbing them in the chest with weapons of varying effectiveness while they are busy staring at some mental image only they can see, this game came as a welcome surprise. I can't rightfully say that the idea is completely new, but it certainly is a game that I had - dare I say it - fun playing.\n\nThis is Luparax, signing out.","June 14, 2015","true","3.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The level design and the lighting are very well done, and the art direction is very interesting. Sometimes the only way to see a guard is the looming shadow he's casting from around the corner, and Hope's (main character) face is remarkably detailed.  The only gripe for me is the character models themselves, what they're wearing, are not very detailed.  But this game was originally released for the iPad so I think that may be part of the problem.\n\nGameplay:  I was initially put off by this being a point and click stealth game, but having played if for myself now I can say the controls work very well.  The player switches between security cameras in the level to gain a vantage point and direct Hope through the levels.  It's a little akward at first, but once you get used to I think you have even better situational awareness this way than you would with a traditional third person camera.  The stealth is very reminiscent of the first two Metal Gear Solid games where stealth is completely based on line of sight, so the gameplay is all about hiding behind objects (or inside lockers), determining guard patrol paths, and waiting for an opening.\n\nI tend to think of stealth games as a kind of puzzle game.  Where the puzzle is figuring out how to get form A to B without being seen.  Most games like Splinter Cell or Metal Gear Solid have combat systems which allow you to, if you get frustrated, throw the puzzle out the window and then pick the next one up from the pile.  Republique has no combat system aside from using items like tazers or pepper spray, so you cannot brute force your way through the tougher sections of the game.  Having said that, after I got firmly aquinted with the game sometime early in the second episode I would say that while some areas are tougher I haven't yet found a section I deemed unfair.\n\nStory:  In my opinion, as interesting as the game is, the narrative is the real high point of this game.  Set in a fictional cult society isolated from the rest of the world, you live in a surveilence state where everyone is both a name and a number.  We aren't told what it is Hope did to get in trouble but the system has had it out for you when the game begins and it's up to you to help her escape.\n\nBut what is truely impressive is not the main story itself, but the world that the writers create around you.  Throughout the game you have ample opportunities to scan objects in the environment that reveal tid bits about the mysterious city you are trying to escape, or conversations between people that are very telling of the live they have to live in this place.  I would say that the depth of the universe here rivals the work done by 2k's writers in Bioshock and Bioshock Infinite.  And similarly to those games it is through audio logs, email exchanges, and hacking people's voicemails that you find out little bits and pieces of this world you are in that make it so believable.\n\nOverall:  It's a very interesting concept that really works.  It will take some getting used to, but it's a solid stealth game.  And if you are into losing yourself in a virtual world, there are few games that create as convincing a universe as Republique.\n\nFinal Note: This game is episodic.  At the time of this review, only episodes 1-3 of the 5 episode story are available.  This should not, however, discourage you from buying the game, as you do not pay by the episode as other episodics do.  When you buy the game, you are paying for all five episodes, it's just that not all five episodes are ready right now.","May 7, 2015","true","8.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

That it was a topical point-and-click stealth game made by people that had separately on Halo, Metal Gear Solid and F.E.A.R which means we have people from Bungie, Kojima Productions and Monolith Studios. These are all good games in their own way but I wasn’t sure what this game would be.\n\nEpisode 1: ExordiumThe first episode began with a minor interrogation of a Pre-Cal known as 390-H or as we came to know her Hope (H-093) after which her cell phone is delivered to her via a security guard simply called Cooper who will help you and give you advice via messages as well as comment on indie game cartridges of his that Hope with your help finds throughout the episode (and presumably in future episodes as well).\nYou however don’t play as Hope, you merely guide her, you know how in some games there are invisible people who help you and guide you but you don't know who they are, well in this game that is who you play as. You are an unknown person who via Hope’s phone has infiltrated a facility, this république, for some reason. You hack yourself into the cameras that are all over the facility and look around after guards and scout head to learn the patrols of guards and with this information you guide Hope from hiding  spot to hiding spot.\nThere are certain cyber-abilities that you can purchase with information you find throughout the very large level to use to your advantage, I purchased 4 out the 5 available but only ever used 2 of those, 2 of those was the abilities which allowed me to get more information just because I wanted to read all the emails and listen to the audio messages. One of the other abilities I had I forgot I had and the other I never risked to use. Hope can also find pepper-spray, tasers and screwdrivers to help her, screwdrivers to get into air-vents, pepper-spray to temporarily disable guards and tasers to permanently disable them. As for them all of them are useful and help but I didn't have to use more than 2 of both pepper-spray and tasers and I believe 3 screwdrivers.\nThe stealth is quite easy, apparently if you get apprehended you get escorted back to a cell but that never happened to me so I can’t say that is the case for certain that is only what I’ve been told, but it felt tense and I was constantly afraid of failure which kept me on the edge of my mind for the 4 hours it took me to complete the first episode. The story and atmosphere are both exceptional and interesting and it is a very good start and I look forward to the rest of the episodes, I will not say more on the story than I already have since I don’t wish to spoil it to anyone who think this is enough to buy the game already.\n\nEpisode 2: MetamorphosisReview on the way ...\n\n\nEpisode 3: Ones & ZeroesReview on the way ...\n\n\nEpisode 4:Coming Out Soon ...\n\n\nEpisode 5:Coming Out Soon …\n\n\n* Each review for each episode are written shortly after their completion.","March 10, 2015","true","4.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The game play was intense and had me sitting on the edge of my seat worried. A few small complaints... The punishment for getting caught was so minimal it made it harder to be afraid of the guards or prizraks due to fear rather than just moving on in the game. Second the camera would sometimes jump to another camera closer to Hope for seemingly no reason which  made some navigation a bit more complicated. Overall fantastic game!

I gave it a shot and was immediately hooked on it. The big issue was, it only had three out of five episodes available at the time. "The last two will be out before the end of the year". Alright, fair enough, right? That will guarantee the developers to make a thorough job with the ending parts.\n\nSo... first of all, this game is a stealth game where you help Hope (390-H) escaping the facility called Metamorphosis and avoiding so called re-calibration (brainwashed, more or less). I don't want to tell you much more than this, 'cause the story in itself is pretty good and is the only real reason to play this game.\n\nSince it was first released on iOS, the interface looks like you're controlling Hope with a touch screen device. But the controls are just as good on PC, mouse to click on where you want her to go, which cameras to control and WASD to look around with the cameras. There's not much else to this game, besides the story - as mentioned above.\n\nBut back to what I mentioned before, the episodes. The first three each took me about 2 hours to complete. The fourth though, that only took one hour to go through. That was kind of an disappointment, considering the long wait (nine months!) and all. Yesterday the fifth, last, episode was released and thankfully it was good, it was longer and it gave a good ending. It got back to the excitement from the first episodes and I really did like it.\n\nWould I recommend this? Yes. For those who like stealthy games and would like a good story. Absolutely. I'm just sad to see it go.","March 23","true","10.3"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","5","12","0","0"

It's in some weird middle-point between a graphic adventure, a stealth game and a radio show. An adventure because the navigation is completely point-and-click. A stealth game because the moment someone sees you, you are dropped back to a cell. And a radio show because there is a ridiculous ♥♥♥♥ing amount of audio logs, which if you don't listen to there is pretty much no game here at all.\n\nThe story is a bit hackneyed, but it's a good one to revisit. And the voice acting saves the whole thing. The audio logs are long, very long. But they are very well-acted, so close your eyes and pretend you are listening to a classic radio serial from the days before television. If you enjoy a female protagonist and a bit of dystopian sci-fi, you can't really go wrong with this.","November 8, 2015","true","10.5"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

It is totally fresh and different to other games. The story is very believable, especially when you look at the raise in surveillance in our everyday world. I played from chapter 1-3 and took around 6 hours, however I did not collect every book or audio file.\n\nStory\nAs described above, the story is very believable. The voice actors are amazing. There are no ground breaking plot twists or such, but I'd say the story is better than most AAA games (as they often have none).\n\nGameplay\nThe gameplay feels fresh because the camera is controlled by (mostly) you. Its quite cool to have Hope wait at some spot, while you scout the place through the cameras, reaveal patrol routes, hack into computers, gather information and so on. Especially the later bigger levels are great!\nThe planning process that is possible due to the many different perspectives (through each camera) is enlightening. In near every level there is a multitude of routes to succeed. The develpers also included the right amount of backtracking - not too much.\nHowever the game itself is a little to easy towards the end, as you have a stuffed inventory and full batteries, so basically in episode 3 I was not once caught by a guard. Also it seems there is no punishment for being caught in episode 1/2 - i dont know about episode 3, except the setback to a certain location in the level.\nAnother minor bad thing about the gameplay is the automatic camera switching - it's quite annoying, as I like to have full control over the camera. Maybe there will be a setting in the future to turn this off?\n\nGraphics:\nMost of the time the graphics is spot on. I did not play the mobile version so I can't compare. But I'd say the graphics suits the game very well. Sometimes the colors are a little washed out, and in some parts you can see recyled posters, newspapers, textures and even level parts. But it always seems kind of realistic, and does not disturb the gameplay. I like Hope's animations a lot - she feels very believable in general. There are some cool effects during camera/room switches, however they tend to stutter a little.\n\nSound:\nAs stated previously, the voice acting is phenomenal. Every piece of content and be it so little got a voice. Ok I have to admit for some posters etc. they used a little trick by not using a voice actor but a text to speech solution. But it is quite rare, and it fits the game world, and is also explained storywise so I have to give credit for this. Oh and the eerie music of the game really improves the overall immersion - really cool.\n\nI guess that was a quite long review lets get to the summary.\n\nSummary:\nAll in all the game is great! I would even say one of my favorite stealth action games. Ok it could be a little harder, but maybe that happens in the next episodes anyway. The voice acting is great, the story and characters are believable, the graphics and music make you feel a part of this futuristic world. I only fear that there will be some backtracking in future episodes as there were a lot of doors in the complex undiscovered (omni v5), however I'm looking forward to the final? 2 episodes.\n\n\nHope this review helps some of you with your decision. I know it's a little long.\nPS: I reported the bug via email, hope it get's resolved soon. Seems the crashes are due to the engine (Unity 5) which is still in beta state.

You guide a girl through a mysterious compound and learn about the twisted world in which she lives while avoiding guards, solving puzzles, and slowly learning about NPCs that should never be judged by their looks.\n\nThe game can get buggy, but the concept of not even knowing who you are or why you're helping Hope gets under my skin in a good way. I actually keep going back for little pieces of information I missed in previous plays because everything is needed to understand how twisted this place can be and how monstrous we can become.","March 27","true","9.4"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

You have the power to hop between cameras, lock and unlock doors and even create distractions later on, while guiding your charge through the hours before "The Arrival."\n\nThe biggest pro for me is that you can't help but care for the fate of your charge. You observe, you can provide indirect assistance, and you can guide, but you have very little power to intervene. You have to be cautious with Hope - while she does have some capacity to defend herself the supplies she needs to do it are finite. I found myself caring about Hope very easily; she is relying on me after all. In that sense, Republique reminded me of ICO - another game where you find yourself really caring about the person you're escorting. I actually got angry at the start of Episode 3 when I saw that Hope had a black eye from one of the other characters, and I found myself tearing up with her at the end of the same episode. If your game gets me to empathise with a character to the point where I'm crying with them, you've done well.\n\nThe world you find yourself in is interesting too - I liked listening to the reasons why the Overseer/Headmaster wanted a particular book banned (you can collect them through the game) and the little details and stories you got about everyone and the world they're in really helped flesh things out for me.\n\nMy only complaint is that stamping "Kickstarter Backer" on the info sheets of half the guards in the game broke the immersion for me. I think that could've been done better. Fortunately these breaks were short and the game pulled me back in pretty quickly. Aside from that, I enjoyed and recommend this game, and I hope the release of the final two episodes will continue to provide the quality gameplay and story I've come to expect so far.","August 9, 2015","true","13.9"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

The story is at this point still ongoing but is pretty solid, if rather predictable even at this early stage; while some details of the overarching plot are pretty easy to suss out, there are plenty of things that remain pretty opaque, and the ends of the chapters especially all tend to have some sudden unexpected little revelation or twist to hook you in for the next episode. If you're paying attention, you should be able to see a lot of the big plot points coming - but some of the smaller ones will still probably blindside you. Beyond a few minor plotholes (which might be resolved later anyway), it's pretty well crafted storytelling, to be honest with you.\n\nYou play a mysteriously omnipotent 'computer hacker' who is contacted by a young teenage girl in the hopes that you can help her escape confinement in a strange facility. Without going into full spoilers, however, there are numerous little things in the game which cast serious doubt on whether or not the player truly is who and what she thinks they are.\n\nGameplay-wise, you leap between a series of fixed cameras to observe the environment ahead of Hope, the protagonist, giving her signals about when and where to move, hide, attempt to steal from a guard, etcetera. As your inroad into the facility comes from Hope's phone, you can't access cameras that are too far away from her due to signal degradation, meaning you have to keep her on the move to fully explore the facility. As you progress, you can unlock new abilities (such as being able to temporarily jam doors, trapping guards or stopping them from catching up to Hope) by trading the information you've discovered with an anonymous 'broker'. Using these abilities becomes especially important later on as the game ramps up the difficulty pretty steadily; by the end of the third chapter, there can be as many as four or five guards in any given room, any number of whom could be wearing tear-gas resistant masks or tazer-proof vests - nullifying the only direct way Hope has to escape when cornered.\n\nThe tone of the game is pretty mature; for example, it raises some questions about what does and doesn't count as censorship, but does so without being patronizing. There appear to be branching paths, based on whether you do or don't choose to share certain information with Hope, but it's not as simple as a binary 'do you want to tell her the truth or lie to her?' choice. On at least one occasion, Hope basically tells you that she doesn't want to know something, leaving you with a choice: Do you show her the footage anyway, because it's something she needs to know? Or do you just view it alone, shielding her from the unpleasant images - but potentially blocking her from something she'd want to see, if she knew about it?\nIt's a much more mature take on the subject and I really hope that the rest of the episodes continue in the same vein, without just suddenly shouting 'ANY AND ALL CENSORSHIP IS WRONG' at the end. I'm fairly hopeful that won't happen though; the devs of this game seem to be pretty well-read or at least have easy access to a bunch of crib notes on a lot of famous literature (some of the collectibles are banned books, all of which have notes attached from the facility's administrator explaining exactly what about them and the themes they represent is so repulsive to his new order), so with a bit of luck the ending will be more complex than that.\n\nBasically, it's pretty good!

That being said, i am now. I do not recomend you buy this game. If you do, then do not have high hopes for episodes 4 or 5 ever being released.\n\nOn a seperate note, the part of the game that does exist is fun, very fun. However, i bought this game on March 2nd. I have been waiting for ANY information about the other episodes outside of the standard "we are working dilegently"; and yet nothing ever comes. So keep that in mind.\n\nFinally, I DO think it is more than a little disrespectful of the devolopers to announce that they are going to begin working on making the game for console when they have provided almost no information about the release plans, let alone progress, for customers that HAVE already paid, despite the fact that a seperate group is working on the console release. The game is not listed as "early access" nor "alpha" or anything that would lead a potential buyer to think that future updates will not come in a timely manner. This is very disengenious. If it has taken the devs this long to make progress on Ep 4/5 then the game was not really in a market ready state. This is disengenious because by placing the game on steam along side full games, some episodic, they are saying our game is ready. Our game has 3 episodes. You will see regular updates to this game and see it to its completion. Instead they have placated their upset customers and we now stand to end 2015 with no information as to when or if they are actually coming out.\n\ni paid $20 usd for the game. 4.6hrs to complete the 3 episodes out. = $4.35/hr of gameplay. Not impressed. Fallout 4, 40 hrs on record, $60usd = $1.5/hr. Life is Strange 16hrs on record, $20 usd = $1.25/hr.

Not only that, but it seems that a PS4 version of the game (which developement obviously started much later) will be released this month with ALL the episodes before the PC and mobile versions are completed (or in some cases, even playable). Shady business decisions like these and the lack of support from the devs in the past 3 years make it hard to recommend Republique or any other game from Camuflaj.\n\nIf you're somehow still interested, wait for Republique to reach the botton of the bargain bin. Hopefully by then the last chapter will be out.\n\nEDIT 26/03/2016:\nSo, they finally released the last episode. However, the Ps4 version was completed and on disk ready to be shipped before the iOS and PC version were released, so my point still stands. They completely halted development of the PC version for an entire year to focus on the PS4 version. It's also very likely that they deliberately delayed the release on the other platforms just to get a few fans to buy on the PS4 again by releasing on the same day. If you are ok with that, well, good for you. But I think this is a disrespect to loyal fans and refuse to support a developer that acts in such bad faith.","March 19","false","14.4"," 7 of 21 people (33%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","33","7","21","9","0"

The gameplay and tactics were alright (as is seen by the 15 hours I spend in game.) That said. You can't ask me to become an unjust, lying man in order to finish the chapter. It is lies and injustice that build her prison in the first place. If you use the same evil to achieve a different end, then there is no true hero and no real point in playing.
