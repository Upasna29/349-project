No tutorials, not a god damn clue on how to play the game.\nGuns and missiles are weak, if you overheat your minigun the cool down takes too damn long.\nEnemy missiles are practically invisble, as are enemies flying toward you leave a trace behind where the missile hides.\n\nGame's unplayable and too boring.","October 12, 2015","false","0.6"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"
