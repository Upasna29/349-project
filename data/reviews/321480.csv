"http://steamcommunity.com/id/framerater/recommended/321480/","framerater","FrameRater","http://steamcommunity.com/id/framerater/","225 products in account","Sigils of Elohim is a puzzle game based on the upcoming "Talos Principle" game by Croteam which engages users to think to the best of their problem solving abilities.\nYou're given a number of shapes to work with and an overall spectrum to insert them in, just like a puzzle. In fact, Sigils of Elohim is basically like a physical puzzle that you place items in to make fit.\n\nIs Sigils of Elohim better than a physical puzzle? The short answer; yes.\nThe long answer? Sigils of Elohim is all that you could ever want a puzzle to be. It's simple, easy, and at the same time challenging beyond belief. Best of all; It's free.\n\nSigils of Elohim takes an approach like a typical iOS/Android title (as it's also free to play for those platforms) and works well as a PC game as it engages simple fun into a very complex situation. Making all the pieces fit the puzzle box may look easy but you're taken for a wild ride once you've tried every possible solution that you feel your brain can handle, and still can't manage to solve it. The only limitation is your mind, and your imagination.\n\nYou can also use codes in this game to get promo items for "The Talos Principle" coming soon.","October 13, 2014","true","1.2"," 55 of 68 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","55","68","0","0"

That's all you do, but for me it's got this "just one more" effect. I would guess it may well do the same for others.\n\nWhen you have only the last piece left that fits into the gap, a timer appears, but I assume that's it, no actual pressure while you play, and no time limit that I saw so far. (I like that a lot.)\n\nI'm definitely going back to this. It reminds me of one of the things in a test I once did to determine my abilities. (Back then I would probably have breezed through. These days, at over 40, not so much. Maybe it'll jog my gray cells back into shape. :) )\n\nThe music is actually soothing and unintrusive. (I'm one of those people that tend to turn music in games off first thing because it annoys me, not so here.)\n\nNo option to turn sounds off or change to windowed mode that I saw.\n\nI'll probably not look at The Talos Principle, I just can't play first person.

While this may be a marketing tool to some extent, the game offers elegant puzzles that are great to play during your lunch break or whenever.\n\nYou are given an open board and several tetris-shaped pieces. Your goal is to completely fill the board with all the pieces like a jigsaw puzzle. The game starts simple with just a few pieces, but quickly advances to pretty large boards. A lot of solutions are accomplished through trial-and-error brute force, but you can also inject strategies to acquire more "elegant" solutions. The best part? By solving puzzles you receive mysterious unlock codes for The Talos Principle.

You can spend much more time by reading this all than trying the game yourself !\n\nOkay I will try to be concise. Do you like tetris? No? Is it because it is rushing you towards putting blocks one after another while not allowing to enjoy the feeling of perfectly fitting corners, rotating the little weight of each block?\n\nOh, so you do like tetris. But were you ever curious about what would be the gameplay like if there is no additional blocks, just a limited number of them, no possibility of erasing lines, just you, your monochrome blocks, and gameplay area?\n\nIf so, this is your game. If you are as cultured as me, then you might see the resemblance between this game and Tangram, supposedly a Chinese game about making shapes from triangle blocks with different sizes. You can use your intuition, your basic understanding of geometry... OR... time to endlessly trying every possibility between 6-8 blocks to fill the table in each level. That is the only bad side of the game, it frequently needs mindless rotating and this dumb strategy is a pretty valid one even for a speedrun.\n\nOther than my this little complaint, this is a pretty good game especially if you consider 1. it is free. 2. it is actually a promotional material. (I heard that the same concept is used in Talos Principle a few times, so a good way of promoting as well) The most thing I like about this game is, it is not trying to be more than what it is, it is a simple puzzle game with few rules and that is that. It does not give any other way of playing it, options do not allow much tweaking etc, and I think this minimal approach helps it. The atmosphere is a relaxing one, and whole design helps this feeling.\n\nWhat else? Blocks feel good it is as if you are playing with some wooden legos. Music is especially good, getting near masterpiece quality but a bit depressive if you ask me. It made me cry once, since I spent 10+ minutes in a chapter!\n\nTo summarize, buy it if you find it less than 0.01.

Both are quite good and polished. Sigils definitely expands on the puzzle style slightly shown in The Talos Principle, and succeeds at promoting interest in the game.\n\nThe difficulty can be somewhat inconsistent, as puzzles are easier with less pieces. It seems like the middle 4 puzzles in each line are easier, while the outer 4 are larger puzzles. I enjoy the style and challenge for some time, but by the end of section C the puzzles are feeling repetitive. There's only so many tetronimo puzzles you can do before you feel you've done this before.\n\n, but the music loops too quickly. 40 minutes of gameplay is pretty reasonable for most players, but the music becomes repetitive in the first 10 minutes. I enjoy the calm style, but it shouldn't loop so fast.\n\nPrevious issues have been fixed, the content is fleshed out, and the unlocks for The Talos Principle are available. The game stands nicely on its own as a neat free puzzler, but also serves as a nice connection to the full game. I wouldn't recommend playing solely for the unlock codes, as they are not needed to appreciate The Talos Principle. Play to enjoy both games and be immersed in the style of the world. I'd like to see more games try this route to build hype with free content.","October 23, 2014","true","4.0"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

There are, at least in my opinion a decent amount of puzzles in game, currently there are 32, but I hear there may be more added later on. completing each group of 8 puzzles unlocks a code to be used in The Talos Principle.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/chronon/recommended/321480/","chronon","Chronon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/chronon/","652 products in account","TL;DR From an excellent developer. Go ahead and try but finishing it is waste of time even for the unlocks (but read on if you want to know why).\n\nAll this game has to offer is on the screens. Don't decide to do it for the unlock codes for the main game or you might end up hating the Sigil puzzles on The Talos Principle. That's how bad it is to get 100+ of them in a row. (Well maybe 60+ since the set C wasn't open yet when I wrote this.)\n\nSigils of Elohim is from one of my favorite game devs and The Talos Principle is awesome, but still, I almost hate this minigame. I bet the devs check how well you did on the puzzles and how long each puzzle takes to optimize the puzzles in Talos Principle but helping them is still barely worth the time when it comes to crunching trough this thing... (Note: not sure if they get any statistics, welcome to correct me.)\n\nThe codes, what the last screenshot represents, are the only reason why I'm pushing trough this but finishing the game requires wayy too much of the same over and over again. I know I have a small problem with this game because I'm way too stubborn to "cheat" so I really advise dropping it this time if you have similar tendencies.\n\nYou have a patience of a goddess if you don't feel negative emotions while cramming this trough but I guess it's possible considering there are so many positive reviews. So go ahead and try the game out for two or three unlocks and then do one of the following:\n\n1. Save an hour or few: Uninstall and look up rest of the codes online.\n2. Spend the time better: Go try the demo of Talos and never look back.\n3. Still feeling like a masochist? I dare you to launch and finish this for loads of "fun times" =P","December 10, 2014","false","2.9"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

And can try it out for yourself on pc or smartphone for free.\n\nBut you like to read? Okay. Sigils of Elohim is a free puzzle game, in which you have to place down blocks in the correct positions in order to complete the level. You can turn the puzzle pieces 90 degrees with every mouse click. The game has around 96 levels, which took me around 5/6 hours. The 96 levels have been broken into part A, B and C. You would think that part C would be many times harder than part A but sadly in my experience it wasn't. The difficulty stays broadly the same. This makes the later levels easier, because at that moment you have more experience. The puzzle pieces for each level never change, you won't get new ones. Every 8 levels you unlock a code to use with The Talos Principle. This also gives doing the puzzles a feeling usefulness.(the unlockables probably won't be game changing) You can also see while playing it was essentially a commercial for The Talos Principle, Because of the lay out design you can see that it was a simple game to develop. While playing I did 8/16 levels at a time. This game was, for me, a puzzle game to play when I was in a bad mood and didn't want to do anything. After having completed a few levels I had processed my irritations/frustrations and relaxed into a sort of zen modes. The music in the background also helped with the relaxing feeling, but when you are playing the game for a long time the music become repetative.\n\nIn short: Sigils of Elohim is a simple, fun free puzzle game that helps you to relax.","January 8, 2015","true","6.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Three puzzle packs (A, B, C) have 4 color areas each and every area has 8 levels. So that's 96 FREE levels to test your puzzle skills in. The game isn't casual or very hard, you can find it somewhere in the middle. It even contains a reward for each color area passed but as I read the rewards do not always work in TTP. Because of generators that some people use to generate reward keys without playing this game (apparently contacting the devs could get you new codes). Overall a good game that is short and nothing really special ... but it's free and fun to bend your mind for a while.","October 20, 2015","true","3.0"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Well, I can't say there isn't anything wrong with this game for me.\nIt's basically just a mini-game that grants you QR-Code Rewards after each set of puzzles you have completed, that you can use for the upcoming game Croteam is releasing called "The Talos Principle".\nI personally love puzzles and this game couldn't have done it better. In some puzzles I'll tell myself, "What am I even doing" or "What did I do wrong?" as it really challenges your mind. Along with great puzzles to exercise your brain, this game also has great yet short music loops.\nOverall, I recommend this to anyone, because once you try it out you won't even know how much time has passed until you finished the first set of puzzles with all your heavy thinking.

It is challenging, frustrating and yet still very fun to play whilst it lasts. However, even though I found it fun whilst it lasted there are still some aspects which could be done better which I will explain below in the Pros and Cons.\n\nPros:\n\n♦ Music was relaxing and awesome to listen to\n♦ Levels progressed in difficulty nicely\n♦ Free to play\n♦ Good concept of completing puzzles to unlock rewards in the Talos Principle ( I don’t own Talos Principle yet, so no idea what these are or do)\n♦ Challenging enough to make you frustrated at times (This is a good point as it makes me determined to beat the puzzle)\n♦ Stunning graphics for what it is (Good graphics aren’t really needed, but it’s a great addition)\n\nCons:\n\n♦ No replay value (No incentive to redo puzzles faster or again once you beat them once)\n♦ No highscores (Would really suit this game as each puzzle is time based and it’d be nice to compare times with Global Players or Steam Friends)\n♦ No Story (If it is supposed to relate to Talos Principle, they could’ve somehow made a story to link Sigils of Elohim to Talos Principle)\n♦ No ingame options menu (Not that you really need one but brightness slider, sound slider and resolution would be good as you should have the option to mute, make it windowed instead of full screened and be able to turn up or down the brightness).\n♦ Short (Could benefit from more levels)\n♦ No achievements or Steam Trading Cards\n\nOther:\n\n♦ Would benefit from a simple level editor which links to Steam Workshop (This would mean players could create their own puzzles and make the game always have new levels to test/play providing people make them).\n\nOverall, Sigils of Elohim will give your brain a workout in some cases and yet still be very, very fun. Also, even though it’s a free game, if it had more levels I’d definitely buy this game if it was paid. Therefore, if you love Tetris and Puzzle type games with awesome graphics, music and own Talos Principle then I highly recommend playing this!\n\nI’d rate it: 3/5 as there are still many cons in my eyes which could be fixed to make the game better. However, it’s still fun enough to kill a few hours.","July 17, 2015","true","1.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Add in some great atmospheric music and you've got a decent free mini-game.\n\nOn the minus side there was no tutorial for people who haven't played this kind of game or puzzle before, and the restart button was bugged so it would exit the game after pressing the restart puzzle button a few times.\n\nHonestly the puzzle concept is nothing new (it's like a couple different kinds of puzzle blocks I had as a kid) but it's implemented well for a computer and the music is quite good.  I finished the whole game in one sitting in about 2 and a quarter hours.  There were a couple frustrating puzzles (for some reason the worst for me was by far the first orange puzzle) but if you don't worry about getting through the game and just take the few hardest puzzles as a chance to do a bit more strategic thinking than just spamming different combinations, you'll be fine.  If you really like this kind of puzzle I'd recommend finding a physical puzzle game set like this (there are a few out there), as this type of puzzling is generally more fun and rewarding with your hands than a mouse.","November 9, 2014","true","2.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There is no such thing here, if you need adrenaline play something else or go outside and run in underwear, if you can run around a block without been noticed you win.\n\n- Yes?  Probably your reflexes suck and you get frustated because mosquitoes bite you and you cannot retaliate, but that doesn't concern me.\nIn this game you have unlimited time and unlimited moves for your pieces, yes, people watching you may get frustrated and super bored as you do not die in the game (or in real life)\n\nDo you have the Talos Principle\n\n- Yes)  Well, if you like it you should get this game to unlock some extras.

Thankfully it's free; if it cost money, I would have buyer's regret right now, as it's too easy to justify spending money on. I managed to complete this thing in under 45 minutes.\n\nStill, 32 puzzles is a bit too few. Also, a number of levels can be easily solved by noticing that the pieces come in pairs, making the solution symmetrical. Furthermore, a number of the blue and green levels are extremely similar to one another, making the solutions easier to find.\n\nAlso, what're the B and C I see on the main menu? And what's the number in the top left?\n\nAlthough I am a mathematician, I solved all of the puzzles with intuition, and did not use any special techniques like parity counting. I did use a bit of brute-forcing at points, but that's about it.","October 17, 2014","true","0.9"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","1"

With no instructions included and no help, it took a little while to figure out the controls and the point of the game; it seems learning how to play the game is part of the puzzle. The goal is to fit the given pieces onto the game board with no overlap and no empty spaces. Left click to select a piece and move it, right click to rotate a selected piece clockwise. Press "ESCAPE" to exit the game.\n\nOnce you've got the hang of the controls, the game is engaging and the puzzles are interesting wiith progressive difficulty. Once you complete a series of "locks", you'll be given a promo code that you can enter into "The Talos Principle" for some surprise or other.\n\nGraphics quality and audio quality are superb and the overall quality of the game speaks highly of the developers (other than the lack of instructions). Times for each puzzle are recorded and you can go back and retry a puzzle to beat your last time. It's on par with the best of these kinds of puzzle games, with excellent music and not annoying sound effects.\n\nIt is a minigame, so if you're quick with the puzzles it may only provide an hour's entertainment. But it's a good hour and definitely made me more interested in playing The Talos Principle when it's released - which was the point of this game anyway. It's definitely worth playing and it may get you more psyched about the upcoming Talos Principle.","October 16, 2014","true","8.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are 3 sections, each with 4 sets of 8 puzzles, and each set of 8 grants a code you can use in TTP to unlock minor things. (If you know the game, the two easy sets give cosmetics, but the two hard ones actually give up to 3 messenger summons and 3 stars, which might be useful.)\n\nBasically, if you intend to play Talos and don't hate the Tetris locks, this is cool. Otherwise a bit pointless.

With no instructions included and no help, it took a little while to figure out the controls and the point of the game; it seems learning how to play the game is part of the puzzle. The goal is to fit the given pieces onto the game board with no overlap and no empty spaces. Left click to select a piece and move it, right click to rotate a selected piece clockwise. Press "ESCAPE" to exit the game.\n\nOnce you've got the hang of the controls, the game is engaging and the puzzles are interesting wiith progressive difficulty. Once you complete a series of "locks", you'll be given a promo code that you can enter into "The Talos Principle" for some surprise or other.\n\nGraphics quality and audio quality are superb and the overall quality of the game speaks highly of the developers (other than the lack of instructions). Times for each puzzle are recorded and you can go back and retry a puzzle to beat your last time. It's on par with the best of these kinds of puzzle games, with excellent music and not annoying sound effects.\n\nIt is a minigame, so if you're quick with the puzzles it may only provide an hour's entertainment. But it's a good hour and definitely made me more interested in playing The Talos Principle when it's released - which was the point of this game anyway. It's definitely worth playing and it may get you more psyched about the upcoming Talos Principle.","October 16, 2014","true","8.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Both versions are free. I played most the time the android version and also there I finished the game.\n\nSigils of Elohim was a nice and challenging introduction for me for Croteams newest game "The Talos Principle". Sigils of Elohim focuses on the puzzles from Talos Principle, where you have to put collected Sigils (puzzles) in a right order to have a complete field. You can call it a Tetris rip-off, but it is a good one.\n\nIf you consider that the game is free and has such a fun-factor to play it, this game is really awesome.\nThe soundtrack of the game is taken directly from The Talos Principle. But it is not the complete OST, so if you will ever play The Talos Principle, than you will also hear some new tracks.\n\nPro/Contra:\n+ nice graphics in steam version. Android version is of course a little bit less advanced in graphics, but still good. It misses only the light reflection effect. Anyway, graphics are not important in this game.\n+ Soundtrack is relaxing, inspiring and peacefull. It is great.\n+ quite challenging puzzles, sometimes you will be forced to give up (this was my case). hard puzzles can be annoying for some people. You must be patient.\n+ you win from this game some codes, which can be redeemed in Talos Principle to get some extras within it.\n+ controls in steam and android version are good.\n+/- some puzzles are repeating (that was my feeling) and you will learn a pattern to solve most puzzles. But I don't wonder at this aspect, because here are a lot puzzles. A big positive point is, that the puzzles here are still different from The Talos Principle.\n\nGive this game a try, it's free and maybe you will buy (like me) Talos Principle.\n\nNice info from my side: As I was in the 5th class, we had the task to create from wood such a field where also such puzzle pieces can be put in, to create a full field.","August 8, 2015","true","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I have my own method which applied gave me results that I am happy with.

You solve puzzles after puzzles, and all you get are 4 codes which can be acquired by simply googling it.
