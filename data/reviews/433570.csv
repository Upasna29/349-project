"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dragnix/recommended/433570/","Dragnix","{FITH}™Dragnix","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dragnix/","743 products in account","This key was obtained from the developer for the purposes of review.\n\nTarget Audience:    Um.....\n\nVideo Review:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdmKgmgaHrc\n\nSummary:\n\nLook, I hate writing reviews like this. But Side Quest is the blandest of action games that needs to understand where it fails: it's an side-scrolling action game that doesn't execute anything well, and doesn't have any appeal. The gameplay is basic in the worse ways: as the KISS principle (keep it simple stupid) is misused in the wrong way: it's so basic, it's boring. You can get combat variety in several ways, you don't need combos even if you use level design/enemy design/visual flair correctly, but Side Quest does none of those. The game has shown you exactly what it has to offer within the first 15 minutes (for the most part), and really doesn't take it from there. It's also a technical mess: art assets are inconsistent and the game has portions where the hit detection doesn't work at all. Look, I don't like being brutal with new developers like this, but in order for them to improve, you have to be. And needless to say, Side Quest doesn't do the job at any level: it fails to get the attention.\n\nLists:\nPositives:\nThe one boss fight is better then most of the game.....\nIt's got a couple of nice art assets.\nMaybe you'll get a laugh out of the awkward dialogue\nNegatives:\nBoring. Boring Boring Boring. No pizzaz, no it factor, no oompf. Way too basic to keep anyone’s attention over time.\nRepetitive. You've got a melee/ranged attack, and be ready to repeatedly use them over and over and over again. Because that's all you're going to do.\nI hate to say this, but I literally feel asleep playing the game.\nGame is short from what I see. Even though I really didn't want to play anymore after an hour, it's got achievements to beat the game under 40 minutes. And with not a lot of replay value, that could be a problem.\nHit detection problems in several places,despite being in clear range of hitting the enemy.\nArt assets are all over the place, and don't seem to fit the same art style with each other.\nMissing options like the ability to turn off music. Glitchy at times.","March 9","false","1.2"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","10","14","2","0"

The Xbox controller does not work, and, the Steam Link controller, nor keyboard work during the "Challenges" It says to press "K" and the "X" button, and I do, but nothing is happening. It does not shoot, or do anything but flash when I press it. Not sure if this means I have to come back to this level again to do the Challenge, but I find it odd to believe that this would be required to do nearly the moment you start the game. Very sad this is happening, because this does look like a fun game. I just wish that "full controller support" meant "full controller support"","February 15","true","0.9"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","9","15","0","5"

The idea and story are pretty good but the controls are really awkward.\n\nThe graphics are all over the place.  Some characters and environments are really nice and others look like they are from a first generation iPhone game.","February 17","false","2.4"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","29","2","7","0","0"

More like a beat em up almost.  Graphics are kinda ♥♥♥♥♥♥ but they have some charm.  Unfortunately it has too many bugs to recommend.","February 18","false","1.7"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","1"
