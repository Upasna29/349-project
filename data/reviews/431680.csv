Between you and me, the negative reviews that will eventually show up , You have to really consider the mechanics of attacking, moving defending....  Hey, if this game was a person I would try to marry it   *note  for those of you with minds ruined by video games, that is a joke, I wouldn't try to marry the game,........... just date it for a while*..  Add *  The interface is only complex until you have tried it a few times, once you do a couple play throughs you will pick this up with ease.","February 13","true","10.7"," 29 of 40 people (73%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","73","29","40","6","3"

Germany start with better less location but heavier and more dense units. While usa have more areas and cities to get more cards...\n\nGermany have to have certain number of mech unit acress to the usa defense line before 15 turns is up...\n\nOver all.. it's well thought out and well planned battle chess with a lot intersting randomness and fun cards to use. The graphics is decent and music is .. well.. repeating war song that I don't hate..\n\n2 games later.. i do enjoy this a bit.. but this game have issues which make me turn my review into negative for now..\n\n1. AI.. well AI is not too smart.. AI units charge your defense position with impossible odds instead of waiting it out.. and don't defense strategicly... don't use a lot of cards.. it must be improved else human win every games.\n\n2. Bugs.. yes.. many many bugs still left in this game...\n\nI once drag a reenforce unit to play in chess region but it got stuck in mid air and won't move.. blocks the center of my screen and it's not return to the starting location... i can no longer click it to move it. even after i click turn end. There is also one time.\n\nI use the card join attack to attack from 2 location, while the computer ask me to select two location. I clicked to use another card to negate one famous general ability... Which cause neither of cards goes into effect. And i am stuck that clicking nothing works on the screen. i cannot even click turn end.\n\nAbove are the two major one I have met after 3.5 hours of play...\n\nAs it's current status.. i cannot recommend it right now.\n\nMay come back to it if this game gets it's bugs fixxed so i will work on rest of my achievements.\n\n6.5/10 for now.. if it's bug free i would give it a 7.5 .. and yes.. not recommended to play right now.. avoid until bugs are fixed. I have made it thumb up right now so it would improve the rate of approval for now since it's not that bad of a game...","June 3","true","15.0"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"
