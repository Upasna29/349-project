Pretty much same engine it seems, with different machines, slightly different "economics", but generally more of the same, but just up and down mountains, instead of fields. Only buy this if Farming Simulator isn't enough for you, otherwise stick to FS, which is the superior game.","January 31, 2014","false","2.6"," 251 of 380 people (66%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","66","251","380","6","0"

Being Canadian, you just have to love snow, or at least like it, if you're to remain sane living here.  A love of skiing might be something you'd think of useful of this game, but you won't be snapping your boots into those bindings and shred the slopes in Whistler or Blackcomb.  You get to manage a ski resort with some pretty detailed aspects of the whole business.\nYou start off with just 2 stations which are connected by a ski slope, and you need to ensure there's enough powder there and that it's groomed just right, which is a bit hard packed for my taste, but it's not back-country heli skiing in deep powder.\nThere are helicopters flying around, the rescue kind, but you don't get to fly them, only bring the 'injured' skiers from some of the missions to the helipad for medivac.\nYou get to buy more ski stations, from small to very large ones, which cost more based on their size.  Own the stations at either end of a ski slope and you own it.\nThen you get to build small to large support buildings all over the mountain, and these include from a simple Tourist Information outlet, to full size Conference Halls, Spa Retreats, Movie Theaters, and so on.\nYou get to choose what kind of service is offered in each building, which have a few selections for each one.  The trick is to cover all demographics of your guests/clients, and the game has some nice statistical breakdowns to help you manage your resort.  Young, Adult, Young Senior, Family, Single, Couple, Romantic, Party, Business, poor, middle-class, rich, and so on.  Lots of info and details to manage day to day, even hour to hour.\nAnd of coure, the best part!  You get to drive all kinds of heavy machinery and 'play' in the snow.\nAll in all I'm really enjoying this Giants title, and the Gold edition includes both DLC packs.  Also, there's some mods available, but not many.  I think the best mods for the game have been made, and still being made, by Don Chris which can be found here: (Apparently posting a link in your review is considred 'spamming'.)  So let me try to cheat here by masking the website for you.   donchris.jimdo dot com\nAll in all I'm very happy with this game and glad I finally decided to buy it.","February 4, 2014","true","13.1"," 48 of 59 people (81%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","81","48","59","6","1"

There are alot of extra things I never needed to use to get the 100% achievements (like snow makers), but that is simply because I hired away the grooming.  You can get into more detail doing that grooming yourself, and if you are hard core then it makes sense.  It does have some tedium (like plowing parking lots), but all in all it is a casual and relaxing time waster, and that is all I asked of it.  It was bought in a bundle for maybe 75c (US) and well worth it.

Most of them are garbage while a few are worth the time.  Farming Simulator 2013 was decent from many who advised me to get it but I was still skeptical.  My buddy bought me this one forcing me to play something I'm normally not into.  Honestly, for ten dollars, you kind of get what you paid for.  It isn't bad, but I wouldn't say it is something I would enjoy for hours on end.  I plan on getting the ten dollars he spent out of it in gameplay since my general rule is one hour per dollar spent.  You don't actually ski in this game but you do maintain the slopes, purchase property, and do random missions for money while bailing yourself out of a bank loan.  There are needs of the people of various classes such as youths, seniors, middle class, singles, couples, etc.  They all have a happiness bar and all require something unique.  You can tailor your resort to a specific audience or do what I did and try to please all of them.  So far, I own two slopes in multiplayer with a friend.  Getting them to stay snowy and not barren can be a chore at times but when it snows you just go rake it with the piston bully you are given.  There are quite the few vehicles in the game, and the graphics are something of about 5 years ago.  Sounds are fairly decent, but the mechanics and detail of the vehicles, their attachments, and whatever else you need are done fairly well.  If you are extremely bored, get this game and give it a shot.  Otherwise, stay away, it is a money pit.","February 25, 2014","true","4.0"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","10","13","0","0"

Its less take care of the slopes, more take care of the resort guest needs.  A decent selection of vehicles, they are setup to add some DLC for sure.

'Ski Region Simulator' is exactly what you'd expect out of a simulation game. It's relaxing, it's not very challenging, it works perfectly with a controller, and it offers just enough variety and just enough incentive to keep itself interesting for a good four or five hours, at least. Giving you some money and a dream, 'Ski Region' gives you the tools and the talent to take a single trail and turn it into a massive ski empire. And I'm not sure about you, but personally, I've always wanted to build my very own highly successful virtual ski resort. I guess somebody out there was listening.\n\nIt's not an easy road though, as you scratch and claw your way to the very top of the premiere ski resort league, and many obstacles will surely get in your hair before the journey is through. Maintaining trails, transporting injured skiers, and other various tasks such as moving salt, and adjusting daily prices occur throughout a busy ski day and it's now your responsibility to take care of the minutia. Buy trails, hire help, and build businesses such as restaurants, schools, day-care centers, and more as you repay your loan to the bank and gain a reputation as a world class ski resort operator.\n\nAnd let's not forget about the vehicles like snowmobiles, tractors, and other things that are fun to drive around in the snow, messing with the trails that you hope to own some day. So like I said, this game is pretty relaxing, and if you're not looking for a challenge, then it's easy to burn a few hours trying to build a successful resort. And ten dollars is a really fair price as well, considering how well the game works with a controller and the overall quality; although the graphics are somewhat dated. 'Ski Region Simulator' is easily one of the better simulation games that I have played on Steam.","March 18, 2015","true","3.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

This is how long the game held my interest.\n\nThe game is a unique and original idea, something i have never seen before. First playing the game, i enjoyed grooming the slopes and buying snow plows that actually push around snow! I very much enjoyed these features of the game until i started to look farther into the game.\n\nSlopes\nSlopes require much maintenance from grooming to delievering snow to keep the slopes in good condition. I Love all the different tools and attachments that can be used to care for your slopes. The problem i have with this is core feature of the game is the ability to "hire a worker." If you have played GIANTS other popular series, farming simulator, you may ask, "why is hiring a worker so bad?" Because you are not really hiring a worker. You pay one flat cost and your slopes are instantly in perfect condition. This has ruined the core featue of the game for me. There is absolutely no point in buying or paying to maintain any equiptment for your slopes when you can have your slopes groomed instantly.\n\nParking Lots/Plows/Salt\nWell when the core feature of the game has been ruined, there is still caring for your parking lots that no one parks on. Yes, you spend time clearing parking lots of snow that no ai traffic goes through to park, not even magicly appear in a parking spot. Well okay, clearing snow is still sort of fun.. Using snow plows i expected some monster of a plow that pushes away all the snow in its path mush like you see in real life, but in this game all it does is make one small path that would make clearing a parking lot take hours of real life time. Well when plows are horrible at their job what do you turn to? Salt. Salt is nothing special, we see it on the back of all snow plow trucks but in real life, tell me, do you instantly see it destroy all the snow it touches? No? well it does in this game. Salt is extremely overpowered and makes clearing parking lots too easy.\n\nIn the end, there is no real gameplay that is worth your time and turns this simulator into a micromanagment mini-game.","January 1, 2015","false","22.3"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

I personally found it very immersive, very very expansive and packed out with silly amounts of equipment available to purchase depending on your strategy. It has the exact same gigantic feel to it that Farming Simulator does and if you dare to try it on hard as I did you'll find you're really really up against it to keep the slopes in good condition. I'd recommend getting the darker night mod available online somewhere as it really adds to the atmosphere.\n\nDo bear in mind you'll be doing a lot of slope grooming so I'd recommend very strongly that you earn enough money early to buy the most expensive slope groomer and Pisten Bully to go with it.\n\nAlso make sure you pay attention to your strategy as if you buy mixed facilities or fail to arrange things right for your preferred target audience you will not make much money. You can still make plenty from missions but the idea is that you do enough work not to need to eventually.\n\nLong nights, busy days, beautiful mountainous sunsets, clearing car parks of snow in a panic, semi-haunting personal quiet moments way up in the hills when a task has just been finished, absolutely wonderful and loads of longevity to it.\n\nAce :)","March 31","true","249.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But there really isn't a whole lot to do in this game. Its mostly just grooming the hills, which consists of driving a machine up and down, up and down, and up and down again. This is basically all you do, plus plow some snow once in  a while. Even though it was cheap, I would say its (in my case) $10.99 out the window","February 16","false","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
