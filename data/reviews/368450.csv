The closer you get to infinity, the more you get lost in the numbers created to describe the real world, and your eyelids become curtains that hide unexpected discoveries beyond the borders, reached by only the strongest thoughts. This exciting play for one spectator is a reward for everyday gifts of the mind.”\n\nThe game is visually stunning, along the sound of flowing water combined with the elegant classical and eerie electronic music.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=546692876\nThis combined with a breathtaking environment makes the game incredibly relaxing if you just explore and don’t focus on the objective.\n\nAt times the game can be frustrating or difficult to discover what your objective is for a specific level.\nAll individually difficult to figure out which requires patience to get into its mechanics yet not impossible to beat them.\n\nBut overall, I still had a blast playing through this small indie title. A beautiful game with an equally relaxing soundtrack!

Unfortunately, Rememoried is lacking in almost every aspect.\n\nThe art style, while nice and minimalist, sometimes makes it hard to see where you're supposed to be going next. This is especially frustrating during the vertical portions of the game. The dialogue is atrocious, vague, and the sound design leans way too heavy on the reverb. If subtitles weren't present I wouldn't be able to decipher much of what's said. Most importantly, Rememoried is much less a walking simulator than it is a "stepping stones" simulator.\n\nThere is so much emphasis placed on platforming in this game when the controls are too sluggish to offer any real precision. I'd often become quite frustrated after having spent so long trying to jump across a seemingly endless amount of rotating cogs or floating boulders, only to fall off near the end, having to start over again several times.\n\nRememoried is a promising game, I really do enjoy the glitchy visuals and the premise of being trapped in the protagonist's dream but I feel that the developer let its potential go to waste and, rather than focus on a story-driven adventure game, instead opted for yet another platformer type adventure game with a unique art style.\n\nDespite the cringeworthy dialogue, I started out quite impressed and quickly found myself not being able to enjoy Rememoried at all.","November 20, 2015","false","2.8"," 61 of 65 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","61","65","2","5"

You might think this is just another walking simulator without any proper gameplay but you'd be wrong - the game is focused on puzzles and platforming.\n\nAll puzzles are based on moving or jumping, there aren't any items to pickup or interact with. You just have to wander through the levels and find the way out. Many environmental elements are usually not stable and (almost) every time you stop looking at a platforms (clouds, for example), they change their positions.\n\nRememoried isn't just about the gameplay, it's really worth praising the graphics and sounds, the whole atmosphere in most levels will make you often stop and just look around to enjoy what developer's artistic skills made.\n\nPros:- Well-thought puzzles where you won't get stuck for more than few minutes.\n- The world around you changes almost everytime you look to another direction (in levels focused on platforming).\n- Great atmosphere. The surreal world of Rememoried is beautiful.\n- Nice soundtrack.\n\nCons:- Short length. Expect getting 100% achievements after 3 hours of gameplay.\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: My copy of Rememoried was obtained for free - I won the game in a giveaway that might have been sponsored by the developer. This fact hasn't changed my opinion about the game (and the review) in any way.","December 27, 2015","true","5.4"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","15","17","0","0"

And then suddenly? It becomes more rage inducing than any game I have ever played in my life.\n\nThis game is essentially pretty precision platformer: the game. The main gameplay mechanic is to basically spin around in a circle over and over to make objects magically move positions in a system the game likes to call "forgetting". This ends up being a horrible platformer where you need to spin around in circles to make a platform appear close enough to you so you can land on it, and then spin around some more to make another one get closer to you. Some parts of the game aren't like this, are much more straightforward, and honestly fairly enjoyable. But at one point in the game I just could not take it anymore. The platforms were too small, nearly impossible to see in the dark, and I kept falling off of them because they were literally spheres. It was total baloney.\n\nOnce again, do not get this game. Please watch a dedicated and skilled Let's Player play through the game for you so you have the chance to see how pretty the game can really be. Do not buy this game thinking it will be some zen experience worthwhile of your time. The developers wanted it to be zen-like, to be taken slowly, but allow me to tell you that when you're stuck in one area for far too long, it is not worth that "zen-like" feeling.\n\n3/10, pretty graphics and cinematography at least. This was a game designed by a brilliant artist...but not a brilliant game designer.","September 21, 2015","false","1.2"," 23 of 32 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","23","32","0","1"

Most of the puzzles are exploratory, but there are one or two insanely frustrating jumping puzzles that almost had me giving up altogether.

Those mechanics are reused many times and it just makes for a tedious experience overall.\n\nThen there is the dialogue which is essentially nonsense. It sounds like they think it's deep but you just can't take it seriously with comments like "Space is dogma.

I think because I spent so much time in level one, I got a little too attached and even scared of the thing that brings you to the next level.\n\nThe game itself is like a 2 hourish walk through several strange worlds. I equate it to a dream because most individuals report dreaming  in black and white, however with the few instances of gorgeous color this game fits the description of a dream itself. The game itself is rather fun, there is one blaring issue that comes to mind, which is present in plenty of indie titles and that is the reliance on one major mechanic to tell the story. In fez it was world flipping, in this game it is 'forgetting' you basically look away from the platforms until they move to your liking, when you're looking at them they don't change. To progress through the game you must walk over to a specific point or do something specific in the almost uninteractive environment. Uninteractive doesn't necessarily mean bad for this game as it isn't necessary a puzzle game, more of a goal understanding with you looking for a focal point in a level and then finding your way over.\n\nIf I had to improve the game (and probably my review here) I'd do a few things, make it either less or more deep, and probably add more variety in puzzles. I found myself frequently flicking my mouse back and forth to change my stepping stones or to look for something changing by the end of the game.\n\nIf I had to give it a score I'd say 7.5 to 8.5 out of ten. I think the creator's message was a bit lost on me, and was probably too deep in general. However the enviroments themselves are georgous. This is a great game for that friend who loves all his indie hits, is looking for a gift or if you can get it on sale I'd recommend it.\n\n","November 12, 2015","true","4.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's basically just weirdness, some nonsensical words spoken to you at times and some slightly tedious puzzles.

The first time it happened was a face that I only got a glance of, so the mind filled in the blanks with disturbing versions. Yet, that is very particular.\n\nTo call this a puzzle game is a far fetch after you figured out that (spoiler?) the stage alters itself when your camera angle is not pointed at it. Other times are finding where to go with some kind of a e s t h e t i c effect on screen, e.g. calidoscope view, lense glare. I suppose thats where the "exploration" tag comes from.\n\nIts definitely a platformer.","January 8","false","2.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Overall a good experience if you want something different then puzzle games or walking simulators. The surreal aspects could have better created and sometimes objectives were a bit more frustrating then enjoyable.\n\nI guess its a good game to get in a sale, i woulndt pay 10 euro for this though.\n\n6/10","January 21","true","4.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The time I most enjoyed the game was floating upwards from giant cube to giant cube. I feel like this should have been chosen as the pace / difficulty of the game.\n\nhad its moments was mostly underwhelming","May 1","false","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
