During the main five levels, your objective is to play with "what's under your blanket" while avoiding getting caught, setting your blanket on fire, and breaking your bed. You must achieve your goal within two minutes by quickly clicking on your blanket to fill up your jerk-o-meter. The faster you click without interruption, the higher your multiplier climbs. The higher your multiplier climbs, the faster your jerk-o-meter fills.\n\nEvery now and then a family member, or special guest for the current level that you are on, will interrupt you. If you get caught, or set your blanket on fire from jerking... I mean clicking too fast, it's back to the beginning of the entire game for you. I might also mention here that there is no save function, and no pause menu. The escape key will also immediately close your entire game.\n\nThe five sub-levels are simple arm wrestling competitions, and barely favor a mention whatsoever. They're thrown into the game for filling the void of an otherwise empty game. Just click away until you finally win.\n\nDon't get me wrong. I had a laugh my first playthrough of What's Under Your Blanket. However, when I revisited the game for a second time to clean up the achievements I missed the first time, due to the fact that they were broken upon the launch of the game and have only been recently patched, the humor was gone and I was bored... stiff. *badum tsh*\n\nTruly, games such as this are destined to end up on places such as Newgrounds... but Steam? It's hard to fathom that this title made it to the actual store front. I know that I'm not helping to keep trash like this off of Steam since I actually purchased this title, but I do hope that games such as this and Shower With Your Dad Simulator are one-offs, and not a sign of things to come.\n\nRating: 1.0/5.0 - It's Bad.Belphegore's Hell House Reviews (Group)","January 7","false","1.1"," 279 of 327 people (85%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","85","279","327","18","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/432020/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2819 products in account","What’s under your blanket ?! is a pewdiepie-bait clicker game. I know what you are thinking, are you really going to do a serious review for this game? Sorry to disappoint you but afraid I am.\n\nThe main aim for the game is to… “finish yourself” under your blanket without being caught by various members of your family. You do this by spam clicking on your blanket to raise your bar (no pun intended) and get a higher score multiplier. As soon as someone comes into the room you need to stop what you are doing, get up and shut the door. That is the whole game. Want arthritis? This game is a sure way to get there. I played the game for 15 minutes and my write is hurting more now than when it does after a full on 12 hour binge playing games. I get that the game is a joke, but it is a joke which is on a front store page asking for people’s money. This is easily a game that should be web based on NewGrounds or a flash game. Not on Steam.\n\nGraphically it is clearly trying to rip South Park’s Terrance and Philip visual style. Granted it is done well, but it’s not an original idea and it doesn’t sit right for me. The sound effects are poor and soundtrack is the same tune on repeat.\n\nThe game is very much luck based. Whether you finish a level is dependent on how many times you get interrupted, and whether you get interrupted towards the start of your multiplier or when you are in the higher numbers. There is no skill involved other than how fast you can click.  The game has ten levels, and two different level types, the “regular game” as described above, and an arm wrestling competion which is exactly the same, just less skill involved as you only have to spam click.\n\nI finished the game in less than half an hour. Achievement hunters will have their fill of maybe another half an hours’ worth of content. Sadly there isn’t any more to say about the game’s length. I guess you could say there is some replay ability, but I would question why you would want to play the game initially in the first place.\n\nThankfully the game does actually run unlike some games on Steam. I would of actually preferred the game not run or have technical problems as it will save yourself going through this awful game and you’ll warrant that refund regardless. Sadly I have owned the game longer than two weeks so I cannot cash out on this game. That being said, the game’s regular price is 79p. Yes it’s cheap, but so is herpes and chlamydia. Do yourself a favour and don’t even waste 79p on this “game”, put it towards something that is much more worthy of your time and hard earned money.\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Not Recommended\n3) Only recommended when on sale\n4) Recommended\n5) Highly recommended\n6) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs up.

It consists of mashing your mouse an ungodly amount of times to successfully fap, whilst building up a bonus on your fap-meter. If you hit 4x points your bed might break or you'll friction burn your junk, which makes sense i guess? The game itself is pretty boring, it's nothing but mouse mashing then occassionally pressing WASD when you hear footsteps, that's it. Also you have to have an arm wrestle after you fap? Additionally, pressing Esc does not pause the game for settings, it just outright closes the game with no warning.\n\nThis is a meme flash game that only exists to gift your friends when you want to have a laugh but lacks any proper gameplay other than button mashing.

It was slapped on the Steam Greenlight program, and received enough votes to be released on that digital marketplace surprisingly quick. However, much like the recently released Shower With Your Dad Simulator 2015: Do You Still Shower With Your Dad title, this one also comes with a decent amount of controversy, ranging between how this service is allowing this type of game to exist to how sexualized the content is and how it can be observed by both children and those easily offended by it. But is there really anything more to this one than just a one-joke gimmick about masturbation, or is there more to this title than meets the eye?\n\nYes, What’s Under Your Blanket?! is literally a male masturbation “simulator” at best. You’re placed in one of five “different” scenarios, all with the same goal of reaching climax. Most of the settings take place in your house, but there is a hospital and a gym to break up the monotony of the similar settings, as well as various interruptions per specific level such as a cat you have to chase out, your grandfather, a nurse, a trainer, and Santa himself. Next to the simple concept are the overly basic controls of spamming the left mouse button on your character to commance pleasuring yourself, stopping when someone approaches, then using the W, A, S, and D keys to run around after people who have walked in, or to close the door for privacy. Keep working yourself until you fill the bar at the bottom of the screen and finish, all the while attempting to reach a 5x multiplier without setting yourself on fire.\n\nVisually, What’s Under Your Blanket?! looks like it could pass as a simple free-to-play web browser flash game and, well, it pretty much is, but with a price tag attached. Think early South Park episodes involving Canadians and without the shadows behind the characters, and you have an idea of what the visuals of this effort look like, but a lot more crude and poorly drawn by hand. Even the heads that appear in the doorway that interrupt you look like someone just pasted them on a black rectangle and called it a day. The backgrounds do have a little more to them, but that isn’t saying much, sadly, as almost all basically use the same floor designs and wallpaper behind whatever one or two objects are unique to that level’s sppearance.\n\nThe audio isn’t anything too spectacular either. The simple electronica is catchy enough for multiple playthroughs, but some of the additional effects like the noise from hitting a multiplier of five and reaching “godlike” status is obnoxious and can drown out the footsteps of approaching family members, if not trick you into believing someone may be behind the door. There’s also some sounds lifted from other games, such as the “fight!” shout during the arm wrestling match between levels that clearly came from early Mortal Kombat entries.\n\nThere really isn’t much else to be said for this title other than it’s a one-joke game that loses it’s impact after your first time through. What’s Under Your Blanket?! only has five levels, which can be done in about ten minutes, even less if you get bored and decide to cheat like I did by the third time through and load up a hotkey code or an automatic clicker tool to do the dirty work for you. The only real appeal of this title after the first one or two plays are the achievements, which are now unlockable following an update that dropped the day after its release. Well, that and the trading cards if you care if. All in all, finising the game entirely and unlocking those fourteen goals will put you at twenty to thirty minutes of game play for one dollar (US currency), which still doesn’t even feel worth it given that this is so basic and crudely done. What’s Under Your Blanket?! was fun for a few minutes, it gets redundant pretty quick, only worth your time and money if you enjoy achievement hunting, trading cards/badge collecting, or find this sort of humour the pinnacle of comedy.\n\nOverall Score: 4/10\n\nReview originally published at www.apochs.net","January 7","false","0.6"," 89 of 124 people (72%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","72","89","124","4","1"

This game doesn't just suck, its aggressively not fun. You click on your blanket to fill up a bar, and you HAVE to click rapidly so you can do so before a 2 minute timer goes down. All the while various people attempt to go out of their way to catch you doing stuff in your bed. In addition, if you click too fast, you either break your bed or catch fire. Get a game over for any reason? You have to start over from the beginning. Hit escape to pause the game for a break? Start over from the beginning. Without splitting hairs, the creator of this game made an awful, painful, visually terrible game. And what little point there was for the game existing goes away shortly before early onset carpal tunnel kicks in: Ha ha. It looks like your fondling yourself. But that doesn't mean you can charge money for a less fun, asinine version of Cookie Clicker. Do NOT buy this game. Not even for a dollar or for whatever discounted price you saw. It's not worth it. Under your Blanket is not worth anyones time or money.","January 6","false","0.2"," 74 of 100 people (74%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","74","74","100","4","0"

What is under your blanket?\n\n(Still wishing for a mixed review option, rather than a straight yes or no)\n\n\nGameplay: The only 'story arc' is that you are a young guy trying to masturbate and you have avoid getting caught or game over. You can get caught your sister, grandmother, dad, Santa and a couple of other interesting characters. You can set the blanket on fire from masturbating too hard or you can get caught by police - Who come busting in with guns blazing.. (Hehe, did you see what I did there?)\n\nGraphics: Pixely, box like goodness.\n\nMenu: Extremely simplistic, volume and effects level bars and that is all . Simple controls (i.e; WASD and click), escape instantly quits game so there isn't even a pause menu.\n\nSoundtrack: Slight variations through levels, but in all it sticks to the same track that does get a tad bit annoying after the few minutes.\n\nFinal Conclusion: What is under your blanket is appears to be a very similar game to 'Shower With Your Dad' simulator, but not in any of the good ways that SWYD sim did. See.. SWYD had decent and addictive game-play that actually took good, quick attention skills. This requires a clicker, or some serious wear and tear on your mouse for the sake of getting your boxy dude off.\n\nIt gets irritating after a short time due to lack of content, lack of replay ability and just an all round lack of anything. The comic factor dies down very soon after you lose a couple of times - Having to restart from the very beginning each and every single time.\n\nIn all, I guess for the short comedic burst, it's worth the money and few minutes of your time, but anything more than that, it's one of those games you play once and let it sit in your steam library forever more.","January 6","false","0.5"," 29 of 39 people (74%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","74","29","39","2","0"

It gets tedious extremely fast and the only reason I have more than 30 seconds in this game is because I left it to idle to get the cards. Fortunately, I got a free key for this game so after selling the cards this game actually cost me less than zero dollars and because of that I can't regret receiving it (although I did hide it my library because I don't want to be reminded I have it).

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Twistorian/recommended/432020/","Twistorian","Twistor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Twistorian/","4393 products in account","TL;DR: An appalling, short clicker game about touching yourself.\n\nIt seems certain that this game was created solely for the lulz. That's totally okay. Anyway, there's so little gameplay value that I'm giving it thumbs down despite the low price.\n\nIn the game you are having some me-time and don't want to get caught. Effectively you try to get enough score in 2 minutes to "win". To achieve this you click, click, click away for the high multipliers.\n\nTo make things a bit more complicated you must not click when someone checks up on you (given away by footsteps). Then you can't continue without getting up and closing the door. Occasionally someone comes into the room and you have to chase them away by walking to and clicking on them. Also you mustn't get too high a clicking multiplier since that will "alert the authorities", for a silly joke.\n\nThe only available game mode has five levels with an arm wrestling contest after each, with the same old click away mechanic but without any other complications: you'll win once the counter reaches full green or lose if it goes all red (it goes down at a steady pace).\n\nSince that's all the gameplay there is, let's take an excursion to the graphical grandeur. It looks like it was done with your average Paint skills in a few hours. The animation is bare minimum. There are perhaps two or three different frames per most animations and there's no animation for throwing anyone out of the room. Finally, there's just some fireworks after winning the arm wrestling instead of, you know, wrestling them down.\n\nMusic is fine though not specially so and sounds effects are again bare minimum (which is actually fine). Humour is predictably crude and ridiculous but you really shouldn't be surprised for that. At least the game is stable. I did notice that it didn't register my clicks all the time though this was a minor inconvenience.\n\nI beat the game in a quarter hour and did the rest of the achievements in a total of 40 minutes, though there are card drops to start at the two-hour mark. However, the gameplay just isn't interesting enough to actually play until that time.\n\nIt's a cheap and easy game to 100% but I wouldn't recommend it to any hardcore gamer. Even a casual gamer will only get perhaps one hour and few thousand clicks out of it.","February 14","false","0.6"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","3"

Source\n\nNo, it's not my humour that's lacking in the case of me giving this a negative review. I admittedly don't mind a few cheap, if sexual, laughs.\n\nWhy I'm giving this a negative is because of its utterly shallow and overly strenuous gameplay.\n\nEverything looks cheap, feels cheap - low quality sprites and stuff like that. Oh, and it IS cheap too. But gameplay is utterly ridiculous. Non-stop speed-clicking for minutes on end, playing to a time limit, with no way to take a break in between, and a start all over from the beginning if you eff up. Not only is this brutally unforgiving if you do it the normal way, it's also incredibly shallow.\n\nThe only reason this gets even a positive score at all is because of the humour - everything else is either terrible or non-existent. Well, that and the fact that 100% achievements is relatively easy - either find yourself a good amount of time, rest up your arm, get a disposable mouse if you have to (do those exist?) and click away...or cheat and get an auto clicker to do it for you, saving your arm (and mouse).\n\nAnd to reiterate - I really don't mind the idea of humour in here all that much. On that note, if you had a dollar to spend in Steam and you wanted something like this, get Shower With Your Dad Simulator instead. There's far more variety in that game than this, and it's much better too.\n\nWhen to buy: At least 95% off, bundle, or best yet, free.\n\n2.0/10","February 16","false","2.1"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","11","14","0","0"

No feeling of satisfaction when your character shoots his fireworks - just a 2 second break to take a deep breath before the new run. This gameplay idea is original among others in the genre, but the design feels so ugly.. I know the South Park stupidity style suits the concept, still even in these boundaries you can do much better. The main compliant is the monotony of the process - the random interfering encounters and funny achievements get old very quickly, the need to start it all over for the 100th time is barely justified.\n\nСложная щелкалка, бросает вызов в том плане, что нужно поддерживать ритм свыше 180 щелчков в минуту от начала до конца (хе-хе) с перерывчиками на простые побочные задания (при помощи WASD), либо на загрузку уровней - да, никаких сохранений, пауз, уровни стартуют мгновенно, малейшая неточность по времени нажатия и начинай по новой. Нет чувства удовлетворения от салютов главного героя - лишь 2-хсекундный перерыв, чтобы вздохнуть перед очередным забегом. Идея довольно оригинальна среди собратьев по жанру, но дизайн крайне уродлив... Понятно, что глуповатость Южного парка подходит для этой концепции, но и в этих рамках можно сделать много лучше. Основная претензия к монотонности происходящего - случайные вмешательства и забавные достижения быстро приедаются, и необходимость в 100й раз начинать снова ничем не оправдана.","February 14","false","2.4"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","4"

I like the art style also, it is very basic, and doesn't have too much detail of which you will be focusing on the background for half of the time... Also, you can fap, and that is just weird, but awesome!\n\nConsThis game is confusing as I said before you can lie under the Christmas tree, and I mean that isnt normal, you should be in bed... in a room, I also found the time limits to be annoying, as just being able to sit and fap would be amazing. Not to be weird, but I think a lot of people would enjoy that... just having a mosh-pit to see who can last the longest. Also adding noises for footsteps wouldn't go a miss, maybe make footstep noises go past the room, so then you have to be even more careful.\n\nOverall reviewThis game is fun, I will admit that, the game-play, is also great, the goal, well as it is weird, it is also great! I love the way the game is at the moment, as I said above adding footsteps wouldn't go a miss, but I would yes recommend picking this game up, it is currently $1.15 without a sale! I mean that is a bargain, I would also love to see YouTube videos of people laughing so hard they cry, or such and such...\n\nExtra InformationDeveloper(s): One Game Studio\nPublisher(s): One Game Studio\nPlatform(s): Windows\nRelease Date: January 5th 2016\n\nWritten for 11th Floor 11th Floor Group","February 13","true","2.6"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","8","17","0","1"

I have spent literally a thousand hours playing this game and I do not regret a single second of it. theres so much replay value its insane. I quit my job and have taken a "temporary" break from school since I bought this game on the day one release. I havent talked to the majority of my family or any of my friends months since ive been trying to prefect/start a pro whats under your blanket scene or as i call it WUYB!? and will be refering to it as so from now on in this review. The pure skill and time this game takes to actually be good at is insane everything about it is so satisfying from counting frames and pixels to get the perfect time strokes to door canceling your inputs to reach climax in record time, its an adrenaline rush from start to finish yes it is. If youre thinking about picking up this game and want to know my opinion as if it wasnt obvious already yes buy it you will not regret it. the only downside to me buying WUYB!? is the measly 150-175 extra pounds i have aquired since i started pioneering this game. The next thing I want to talk about might be my favourite part about this game, the story. It immediately pulls you in from the first second with the lovable and funny characters and intriguing story. for the sake of this review i will not be going into detail as i believe that the first playthrough of this masterpiece is possibly the best as you hold onto that wonder and sense of adventure with ♥♥♥♥ in hand. its truly beautiful if you ask me. I would go as far to say WUYB!? may have changed my life for the better, it has really taught me about love, friendship, and compassion. So to sum it all up yes. i do reccomend this game. but ONLY if you want to go on a grand, tear jerking (no pun intended), feels feeling, story telling work of art video game for the measly price of under 5 dollars.","April 8","true","075.6"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","33","3","9","2","0"

The game control is enough easy you just need use mouse for clicking and WASD to move sometimes, for example close a door. And where you do that? In a lot of place, for example hospital, home, gym etc. The graphic style enough simple, a bit try follow a South Park style. A music and sounds also don’t have any special characteristic, but not bad.\n\nSo my verdict\n\n+multiplayer in future\n+low price\n+steam achievements and trading cards\n\n-after some time can be tiresome\n-not for all\n\nSo this game does not want be more than what it is. It is another enough silly game what been developed with one little studio. In last time in steam we can found always some new games like this, for example Shower With Your Dad Simulator 2015: Do You Still Shower With Your Dad. This game in a future get a multiplayer, however i cant imagine how its been realized. Well for who i recommend this game? Mostly for all people who like games like this and like collecting different games for steam. If you have a spare dollar (if you are from US) you can buy it, or wait when its get a big discount / going to bundle.","January 9","true","3.4"," 14 of 42 people (33%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","33","14","42","2","0"

Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.--Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.\n\nHe has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.\nHe has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.\nHe has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.\nHe has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.\nHe has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.\nHe has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.\nHe has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.\nHe has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary powers.\nHe has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.\nHe has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harrass our people, and eat out their substance.\nHe has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.\nHe has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power.\nHe has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:\nFor Quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:\nFor protecting them, by a mock Trial, from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:\nFor cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:\nFor imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:\nFor depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury:\nFor transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences\nFor abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies:\nFor taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws, and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:\nFor suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.\nHe has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.\nHe has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.\nHe is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty & perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.\nHe has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.\nHe has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.\n\nIn every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.\n\nNor have We been wanting in attentions to our Brittish brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.\n\nWe, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally diss a copy of the declaration of independence.","January 10","true","0.4"," 8 of 34 people (24%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","24","8","34","6","0"

I honestly think the difficultly would be fine if it current diffculty of the 3 level was the peak (last level difficulty). ** on a side note I honestly think I should ice my wrist.\n* How to play critique\n- doesn't explain what the ESC key does\n- doesn't explain how to get intruders out cat, grandpa, etc...\n- I feel like there should be or is some mechanic to continue play after  cops or firefighters show up\n- Lastly  on the win screen the only way to exit is the ESC key and it doesn't say anything\n* it would be nice to have a windowed mode\n* sounds seem to play too long e.g. cat's purring continues after it's gone and  sirens continue too long but sounds cool with the music\n* when you get a "god like" it's very hard to hear footsteps which has lead to me being caught several times :(\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS\nfor what it is and the price I give it a 9.5/10\nwhat would raise my score to 10, less carpal tunnel mode, such crapl toonlz!","January 8","true","2.1"," 4 of 25 people (16%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","16","4","25","0","0"

Bad graphics?  Yes!  But you could see the graphics in the game's preview.  Were you expecting Fallout 4?  Guess that's a bad thing.  This game is not Fallout 4.  Intriguing and compelling story?  Did you miss the title of this game?  What kind of compelling story did you expect from a game titled "What's under your blanket" and with a description mentioning masturbation?  Were you expecting The Witcher 3?  Spoiler Alert, this game is not the Witcher 3.\nSo what do I think of this game?  What else do I expect for something I bought from selling trading cards?  I got this game for free.  I have no expectations for this game other than a giggle.  It was cute.\nI see so many people saying "I kept setting the blanket on fire"  Well if you actually clicked, without downloading a mouse clicker app, or going to a keyboard macro... its pretty hard to set yourself on fire.  I think the fire, bed breaking, tree collapsing is to stop people from using these tools.  That tells me that the dev actually considered with their clicker game that people would try to cheat.  And the anti cheat works.  It actually causes you to click.\nAnd people worried that some 12 year old child will get their hands on this game?  Watch your children's Steam purchases.  Parenting is so tough.\nIt was a cute game.  I got an 89 cent giggle.  Still a better game than the Slaughtering Grounds and still a better dev than Konami\n","January 8","true","0.2"," 13 of 46 people (28%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","28","13","46","6","0"

Playing (any game) should be enjoyable, and my review is only for those who really want to know about its aspects in a positive perspective.\n\n\nPros:\n-First of all, this game made me laugh since I saw it. A lot of people I know laughed too, very creative. Graphics made in paint creates a funnier atmosphere.\n-It was pretty difficult in the beginning, took a couple of deaths until discovering its full mechanics (all actions that may kill me, how to grab special invasors, how bar must be filled). I like games that let you figure out for you own how to play.\n-I enjoyed difficulty in playing permanent "Ironman" mode.\n-Every level game brings a different idea of scenario, more hilarious\n-Easy achievements that gave me another Perfect Game. yay!\n\nCons:\n-It hurts your hand, must be careful to play\n-ESC closes the game, no pause screen\n-Very quicky to complete once you fully understand how to play\n\n\nPeace!","January 7","true","3.6"," 9 of 62 people (15%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","15","9","62","2","0"

It's great.  It just needs more content.  The game was waaay too short considering how little work it would have taken to extend it further.  However, the developer says he has new content and even multiplayer coming.  Hope it's all free!  He says it's going to be a DLC but maybe he will make it cheap enough so that people will actually buy it.\n\nAll in all, we need more comedic games like this on Steam.  And wow, look at all the negative review upvoters out there.  RIP my review.  210 positive, 38 negative, and there is nothing positive on the front page.  I'm a bit shocked to see the haters out there in full force.  I don't even know what to say.

Basically just got to avoid getting caught jerking off by your family, a martial arts trainer, and a cat. Yes, a cat. This is definitely worth the $0.89 I spent for it, as was the "Shower With Your Dad" game. Give it a try, why don't yah? :D\n\nEdit: You can always get a refund if you don't like it.

I absolutely had to complete it. I tried different mouses, using a laptop trackpad, even using two hands. It seemed no matter what, I would get caught or that stupid cat would not leave. I researched tips on how to complete it; videos to see what happened when you did. To no avail did I find anything. It was up to me to complete the game. I tried and tried again, even used a massaging lotion on my arm and hand. For, as a female, my muscles are not as adapted in the correct way that this game requires. Finally,  after half an hour of trying, I finally get it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tacorektm9/recommended/432020/","Tacorektm9","TC-M Spaco","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tacorektm9/","81 products in account",""What's under your blanket !?" is a modern masterpiece created for those who have experience in furocious masturbation.\n\n(Gameplay)To start off, the second I clicked in I started getting a real hard on, seemingly out of nowhere. But then, my father, Adolf Hitler, barged in with the belt, and told me it's time to move out. He didn't mean the house however, he mean't my room. Back into the closet I went, as my father threw alcoholic bottles towards my direction.  I waited for him to leave, got back in bed, and continued to, normally, do nothing but attempt at jitterclicking my ♥♥♥♥ until the cat barged in, which I chased around for 3/4 of the game until realizing I could click it out. My sisters curly red hair persuaded me to try and get up, and attempt to molest her. But unfortunately, if I stand up in my Powerpuff girl boxers she screams and I lose the game. This section is a meesley 8/10, unable to boink with sister.\n\n\n(Graphics)\nThe character design (stolen from South Park) is done to such an extent that the tears in my eyes paralyzed, as I realized how I just wasted one ♥♥♥♥ing dollar to write a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ review on this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ product. Infact, even the style ripped off of South Park is poorly done, and very little is to be seen throughout the game no matter where you travel.  Ten out of a thousand, you had one chance, (ghetto company that thought this was a good idea because masturbation jokes lol!1!1!)\n\n\n(Story/Character Development)\nThe development is the juicy part. You start off as the unnamed protaganist, who's main goal is focusing on the hentai he's been studying all of his NEET years to memorize. One wrong move when the cat walks in and you lose every single cent you saved for Huniepop. Look what the cat dragged back in, Father Fuhrer. 69/69000\n\n\n(Cons)\nOh so many cons could be covered, but one is mainly focused around the price. Team Fortress 2 has indefinite fun and hours for free, while this abomination is something you'd expect to be on a mobile app.  I would rather refund everything I've every bought and purchase thousands upon thousands of copies of Bad Rats than glance at this monstrosity in the store again, infact, it shames me it exists in my library.\n\n\n(Conclusion)\nWhile this game is none but jokes, it's $1. And my $1 is not a joke.","March 21","false","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Believe me, I'm a connoisseur of ♥♥♥♥ games on Steam. I've played all the greats. Bad Rats, How do you do it, Garfield Kart, whatever. They all have something to keep you coming back to them, in the same way that you might stop driving to look at a horrific car crash, and that sort of thing. Or they're just free, so you just play them for a minute or two (or five if you feel the need to tell people it sucks), and who cares.\n\nBut for whatever reason, you have to pay for this one. I'm really not sure why, it has about as much depth as a pornographic Flash game floating around the seedy parts of the intertubes. Less depth actually, and not really that erotic. So... I don't get it. I mean, the developers obviously have the free time to write some really basic code and draw some really basic art. Why don't they use their powers for good instead of suck?

But then, my father, Adolf Hitler, barged in with the belt, and told me it's time to move out. He didn't mean the house however, he mean't my room. Back into the closet I went, as my father threw alcoholic bottles towards my direction.  I waited for him to leave, got back in bed, and continued to, normally, do nothing but attempt at jitterclicking my ♥♥♥♥ until the cat barged in, which I chased around for 3/4 of the game until realizing I could click it out. My sisters curly red hair persuaded me to try and get up, and attempt to molest her. But unfortunately, if I stand up in my Powerpuff girl boxers she screams and I lose the game. This section is a meesley 8/10, unable to boink with sister.\n\n\n(Graphics)\nThe character design (stolen from South Park) is done to such an extent that the tears in my eyes paralyzed, as I realized how I just wasted one ♥♥♥♥ing dollar to write a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ review on this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ product. Infact, even the style ripped off of South Park is poorly done, and very little is to be seen throughout the game no matter where you travel.  Ten out of a thousand, you had one chance, (ghetto company that thought this was a good idea because masturbation jokes lol!1!1!)\n\n\n(Story/Character Development)\nThe development is the juicy part. You start off as the unnamed protaganist, who's main goal is focusing on the hentai he's been studying all of his NEET years to memorize. One wrong move when the cat walks in and you lose every single cent you saved for Huniepop. Look what the cat dragged back in, Father Fuhrer. 69/69000\n\n\n(Cons)\nOh so many cons could be covered, but one is mainly focused around the price. Team Fortress 2 has indefinite fun and hours for free, while this abomination is something you'd expect to be on a mobile app.  I would rather refund everything I've every bought and purchase thousands upon thousands of copies of Bad Rats than glance at this monstrosity in the store again, infact, it shames me it exists in my library.\n\n\n(Conclusion)\nWhile this game is none but jokes, it's $1. And my $1 is not a joke.","March 21","false","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I can totally recommend this game to everyone who wants to further improve their fapping Techniques. In this Game you can see high quality graphics. The music is like the best existing in the entire World. I think the only game that can beat this game is Teddy Floppy Ear - Mountain Adventures. Which I can recommend aswell especially for people 18+, cuz dis game is really intense and hard. I barely beat those Games with Google, really good Walkthroughs and Guides. Im happy that I got all achievements on this awesome Game.\n11/10 Will buy this game for everyone on my friend list and all of my other Accounts.\nI hope I can show this to my children named Kevin 1 and Kevin 2 for a daughter I would say Kevin (no offense against Kevins) and be like: Look Kids, this is what your daddy spent his time on instead of fapping in reallife and watching some Gayporn on some sites that I dont want to talk about here.
