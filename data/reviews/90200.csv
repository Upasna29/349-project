It's probably the best game ever made. Don't believe me? Ok then, take a look at these amazing features this game offers:\n\n*4 different crop types. Ever wanted to have a variety in your farming sim games? This is where it's at. It can't get any better than this.\n*Cows. With the new motion-track technology, these cows are probably the most detailed you will ever see. They move, eat and do other stuff just like in real life. It's 100% accurate!\n*Next-next-gen graphics. With all these kids playing their Xbox One's and PS4's, talking about the "next-gen graphics", they don't know that Giants Software already did it. These stunning graphics have been considered to be even more realistic than real-life itself!\n*Atmosphere. You can spend hours sitting in your tractor, listening to nature sounds, watching the beautiful scenery with those realistic animations.\n*Multiplayer. Ever wanted to have a farm with friends or family? Now you can! With all the features listed above, you can just keep playing this game and never even stop! This is currently the only multiplayer game that has been proven to have absolutely zero connection issues and no lag!\n*Perfectly balanced. While other farming games can be a little unrealistic with money, crops and other things, this game is balanced, so everyone can have fun while playing the most realistic game ever!\n\nStill not convinced? Read again!\n\n10/10 would play forever.","November 27, 2013","true","122.1"," 60 of 79 people (76%) found this review helpful 25 people found this review funny","76","60","79","25","1"

It's all about you are a farmer to run a business, buy new tools, tractors and more. You begin with fairly simple things but it is easy to upgrade themselves.\n\nThe game itself does not have the best graphics, but you still get a good gaming experience. There is also a multiplayer which is very fun to play on.\n\nThis game is very time consuming and it takes time to wait for things to grow, but there is always something to do.\n\nMy experience of the game is that it's too bad the graphics for my taste but I recommend it anyway.

So if you are new to the franchise you can happily start from the oldest one but if you are looking for eye candy of course the newer look better ;)","April 29, 2015","true","170.2"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","14","18","0","0"

This is sadly misleading however, because if any game falls under the description of "deceptively entertaining", it is FS2011.\n\nThere is a surprising amount of depth and strategy to the game, knowing when to harvest, when to sell, and when it is time to purchase new equipment. The game world is fairly large, and the freeform gameplay makes it easy to just wander off and explore for a while. As a side benefit, there is a rather large mod community that put a ridiculous amount of work into making sure that random 80's farm tractor #36 is as accurate as possible.\n\nIf you're interested in a fairly detailed simulation game that has gameplay that is a fresh change of pace from your typical action/shooter/racing/strategy game, than you could do a lot worse than to fire up the demo.","November 23, 2012","true","2.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","1"

The economy is relatively robust, there's some fun time-keeping challenges in keeping everything balanced, and there's a good bit of variety in vehicles/ crops/ activities/ etc. The graphics aren't great (crops will pop in when you're about 10 meters away, despite being able to render the buildings and mountains in the far distance), but I'll admit, they do the job. On the whole, it has a lot going for it. Except for the controls. Every time I've opened the game the controls have, to some degree, randomized, including at one point, mapping one of the buttons for activating a key tool to the button for turning left. This was the most annoying example, and the first I came across, but there have been plenty of other occurences of two completely separate functions (e.g. changing what crop you sow, and activating the machine that sows fields) to the same button, or with functions completely missing. If this was the first week of the game's release, I'd let it pass, but not in a game that came out in 2010.\n\nTL;DR\n\nGood game ruined by badly coded controls\n\n================================================\n\nREVISED\n\nChecking the local game files fixed the coding issues, but then when I had to update my OS the game just stopped being openable- the icon would pop up, and then crash","August 3, 2015","false","25.9"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

This game is more fun than it should be, and allows for some hilarious situations if you decide to drive like a fool, or attempt to use farm equipment in ways not intended.\n\nIt does allow for more serious play as a simulation if that is your thing, with many different ways to farm, and a lot of freedom in where you do it.\n\nThe one thing I did not like about this game is how the methods of farming are quite alien to the ones I have seen living in farm country (in America, the simulator is euro themed which is fun, but did not make it feel very real for me). Instead of making circles around the fields it seems designed to go across, turn around, go back, ect. Nothing wrong with that, but it is less efficient and realistic (at least for the area I live in, I am not sure if this is how it is done elsewhere). This might be just a symptom of your AI farmhands being hilariously dumb. Nothing stopping you from doing zigzags while driving yourself if you wanted to, but in order to make full use of the hired help, you must very carefully align your derpy farmhands who will just drive back and forth until they reach the edge of the prepared land (mostly...sometimes they might just sit there all lazy like soaking up pay :P)\n\nThere are many mods for other maps, AI changes and implements, but I have not used them much myself. I tried a couple for AI improvements and maps but the ones I used made little difference for me, and I preferred the stock map.","December 29, 2013","true","60.1"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

Purpose and meaning must come from somewhere beyond – from our connectedness with “some higher order of things.”  This “higher order” or “higher power” is the ultimate source of ethics and morality. A sustainable agriculture is built on an ethical foundation of friendship and stewardship – a more enlightened concept of self-interest.\n\nThus, the new American farmers, who are finding ways to farm more sustainably, are creating a metaphor of a more sustainable human society.  As a society, we must stop exploiting our natural environment.  We must look again to the timeless principle of diversity in finding new means of sustaining human progress.\n\nI believe that we can, and must, help create a new kind of agriculture that will sustain a high “quality of life” for farmers and society, both for this generation and for all generations to come.  That’s why farming is important to America.","January 1, 2012","true","5.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

It's neat to use, see and hear the various equipment and vehicles in action. Satisfying to plant & harvest your crops then gradully build up your farm and gain more new equipment to use over time. If you have a steering-wheel controller, then it will be a more immersive expereince.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Trambapoline/recommended/90200/","Trambapoline","Trambapoline","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Trambapoline/","218 products in account","The most highly touted game called "Farming Simulator 2011" ever to hit Steam! This photo-realistic and absorbing game will show you what it's really like to be a farmer; as you tend the crops, harvest the wheat and watch your 50-cents-an-hour hired worker get his tractor lodged on a scarecrow because he has no sense of direction.\n\nFarming Simulator 2011 features the most up-to-date list of essential farming equipment for all your simulation needs. Vital inclusions are all here; such as farms, grass, cows and, yes, even a Gas Station! This is a developer who listened to the demanding cries of the farming simulator fanbase, to be sure.\n\nYou'll find yourself in awe as you drive your tractor down the streets, watching cars fly through the air in celebration of the complete lack of gravity; which we all know farms do not have in any way. In this moment, you'll find yourself wondering what all farmers... nay, what all gamers have been wondering since 2011!\n\n"Why the hell did I buy this?"","March 30, 2012","true","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Also check out the mods for this game theyre pretty good\n","February 7, 2015","true","8.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
