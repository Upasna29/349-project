It lacks a depth in maneuver options due to the large tile scale and similarly it lacks sophistication during the movement phase. The Ai needs work to make for a good oponent. After playing only one turn I noticed the Ai diong some inexplicable things. Overall this game falls far short of expectation. Also, due to a cursor bug, for me it was unplayable.\n\nThere seems to be a mouse selection problem where it moves the focus on the selected unit to some random point on the hex grid. Unfortunately I had to give up playing during the second turn as I could not control the units. I think that is grounds for my money back.\n\nI would echo other reviews that this is more a mobile game in the style of Civilization rather than an epic game in the tradition of the SPI board game War In Euope.\n\nDespite and also because of my criticisms, I would be very keen to see this game reworked to mirror the style of the hexwar online board game. And yes, I would be prepared to pay more a lot more for that.","July 24, 2015","false","0.5"," 51 of 56 people (91%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","91","51","56","2","1"

It's worth maybe 2-3 Euro that it would cost on a phone, but on a PC it's simply too shallow and too short.\nShame it's not better developed, as it has potential.","July 24, 2015","false","1.5"," 45 of 58 people (78%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","78","45","58","4","0"

If a game has negative reviews, it's not likely to be a good game.   Mouse pointer jumpes all over, takes multiple clicks to finally select the unit.\n\nGame is very slow, plodding.  Units can't move far enough in a turn to make it fun.  Typical turn, move all units forward one hex.  Attack what ever you can reach.  Not much strategy, IMO.\n\nRefund pending.","January 20","false","0.5"," 31 of 37 people (84%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","84","31","37","5","2"

I've played a number of the scenarios and campaigns. Most of them are not worth the time, but the full Barbarossa Campaign on the hard level was quite entertaining, IF you play as Germany. The Russian A/I for this longest campaign makes some good moves, IMO. It seems like the game designers poured all of their energy into making the Russian A/I fairly competent for this campaign. However, the German A/I for the long scenario is HORRENDOUS. Completely passive, defensive, no blitzing, etc. Horrible.  Please come up with a head to head version. The victory conditions need changing as well. In the Barbarossa campaign, the conditions change from turn to turn. A fixed victory condition would be an improvement, IMO. This game has potential.","July 28, 2015","false","13.9"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","0"

I have only played this game for a short time and although simple to play it is too simple and too slow to be a real East Front game.","November 29, 2015","false","3.0"," 15 of 20 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","15","20","0","0"

AI plays dumb: in 1941 a German AI will march AWAY from the border and will be slugging it out on the frontier until winter, even at the hard setting. There should also be some railroad movement in the game. Good basic design that plays slow and stupid. Better AI a must. Some tweeking to make the game more exciting would be nice too. Basic design is good and no bugs.","February 3","false","11.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","4","5","2","0"

The complexity is at about the level of the old Avalon Hill board games from the 1970s and 80s. There's other games out there with more detail and management but this one strikes the right balance. And it's historically more realistic. My panzers got to the gates of Moscow only to come up short despite capturing major Russian armies with pincer movements. If you want a beer and prezels game with scenarios that can be finished in a couple of hours then I recommend Russian Front.","July 25, 2015","true","5.5"," 14 of 28 people (50%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","50","14","28","3","0"
