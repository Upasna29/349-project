Super Splatters is so unconcerned with being taken seriously, so committed to making you laugh and smile, that it’s hard not to forgive some of its more frustrating parts for the sake of how much fun it’s having.\n\nSuper Splatters is all about skill in an environment you wouldn’t expect to demand it. Your goal isn’t to do good yourself, but impress the audience watching you and in turn earn fans to help propel you to the next level of splatter stardom. You do this by making an absolute mess, shooting your wiggly body toward small balls you need to cover with your explosive fluids in order to clear a level. The challenge is you’re only given a limited number of goo-people and balls are typically spaced out so as to require a lot of tricky maneuvering to catch them all.\n\nFor a game seemingly aimed at more casual players, Super Splatters has an abundant amount of depth in its scoring system and outrageously difficult level designs later on. Different shots activate stunts, the more of which you chain together the higher your combo gets and the more fans you’ll receive. This becomes fiendishly complex when you have to deal with multiple colors, required stunts, and an increasing number of spikes ready to prematurely split you open.\n\nIssues only arise when Super Splatters’ somewhat luck based design begins to feel as if it’s working against you. As you’re required to clear every level entirely, it’s not uncommon to end up with a single ball remaining do to you goo somehow not penetrating a stack enough, or slipping through the floor faster than you’d anticipate. Later stages are positively infuriating at times, testing my patience with little in the way of direction, and losing much of the cheerful dialogue that made earlier levels such a joy.\n\nMaybe that’s a bit of a baseless complaint though as there isn’t ever a reason you’re forced to play past a comfortable difficulty. Super Splatters is fully focused on giving you as much or as little a challenge as you want, so outside of completionists there’s never a forceful urging to push you outside your comfort zone. And that’s something I find really refreshing: a game so completely devoted to having a ridiculously good time that you can’t help but enjoy yourself.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YQ1k2f26CI&ab_channel=MrNinjaSquirrel\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","March 30, 2015","true","5.7"," 27 of 33 people (82%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","82","27","33","3","0"

Why ? I think because of the graphics. They're colorful and there are lots of explosions, and the game zooms in when you set off the last fireworks pod. You also have to think about your moves.\n\nThe game has several gameplay modes, all rolled into one big mode. You'll be playing levels where you have to set off all of the fireworks pods, or have to perform stunts while setting these same pods off.  Especially the last one is tricky but fun, because it adds depth to an otherwise simple looking game.\n\nLevels can be reset quickly so if you mess things up you can start right over. And you'll be doing that a lot, trust me.\nThere's not much to tell really, it's all fairly simple. The goal is to blow things up while performing stunts, and all of that will increase your popularity. Sounds simple, I agree. But you'll see what I mean soon enough. Just give it a try.\n\nSuper Splatters is a fun game that definitely deserves your attention.\n\n[Rating: 74/100]","July 5, 2013","true","4.6"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","0"

The goal of the game is to set of fireworks by shooting blobs of liquid igniter at them. This is a fairly simple concept, but can be hard to achieve when you reach later levels. As you work your way through the levels, you will unlock new tricks to help you complete your goal. Depending on which gamemode you play on, the tricks will add another layer of challenge to the game. In my opinion, the gameplay is cute and nicely done.\n\nThe graphics are very bright and clear. The game is vibrant with color, which makes is very fun to watch the blobs explode all over everything. I don't really care for graphics as much as most people, but I find these ones great to look at. They gets two thumbs up from me.\n\nThe music and sound for the game is adjustable, so if you grow tired of it, you can always shut it off. The blobs do make unintelligible noises when they talk in their quirky ways, which I find to be really cute. For most games, I tend to turn the sound off, but I leave it on for Super Splatters, since it's enjoyable to listen to.\n\nThe reply value of Super Splatters is moderate. You can go back to finished levels to try to acheive even better highscores than before, which is a definite bonus. And while it is fun to watch the little blobs hurl themselves to certain death, it can become repetitive after awhile. I would recommend picking Super Splatters up during any sale.","November 21, 2015","true","10.7"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

Now lets go to town on it.\n\nPros:\nSimple\nFun\nColorful\nEasy to control\n\nCons:\nThis game will hold your hand like your mom in a supermarket\nYou will have to sit through dialogue. This is a game that does not need dialogue.\nThis game will become extremely easy.\n\nAnalysis:\nSuper Splatters. I picked this game up in Humble Bundle 14. Pretty nice bargains so I decided, why not?\nGot this and a couple of my favorite PC games in it. Lets get back to this game.\nThere's not much to say about it.\nYou point and shoot. Not like FPS point and shoot. You literally click where you want to go and shoot that way.\nNot much else to it. This game is a game that you wouldn't really play to get good at.\nIt's more like what I'd like to call a "pick up, put down" game. Meaning, you just pick this up when you're bored and put it down when you've found something better to do.\nThe bright and flashy colors will keep you entertained for maybe 15 to 20 minutes. That's as long as it will take. It's pretty much a flash game, but made for people who are too lazy to search on Google.\n\nThis game holds your hand. Like literally. I get that there are tutorials, but sometimes I just like to throw myself into a game and learn on the go. Not like this one needs explanation, but still. I feel like I'm 5 whenever I start a new stage.\n\nDialogue is not a thing that needs to happen in this game. I've played flash games just like this and some of them still stick out more than this. You know what they didn't have? Dialogue. You don't need it. It's just sort of a break in the game. You want to start moving, but here comes yellow splatter to tell you how to impale yourself on a spike. Yippee. I feel as if it's an intentional thing. Maybe the creators are trying to psych us out.\n\nThis game gets super duper easy. How easy? I'm going to answer this question with a question. How easy do you think it is to breathe? I'm quite sure (Unless you have asthma. If you're reading this and you do have asthma, I'm super sorry) breathing comes naturally to most humans. This game will teach you to flip and say it's gonna get challenging from here on.\n\nIt doesn't. I've found myself just flipping multiple times for a better score/3 stars. It almost seems as if all of the tutorials, dialogue and handholding were unnecessary to even include within the game.\n\nThis game, as I said earlier, was most likely not made for extensive periods of play. It's a game that you can pick up and put down at will and forget about.\nWith flashy colors and simplistic controls, this game handles well and looks great.\nThe dialogue will seem a bit unnecessary. You'll have to deal with it sometimes.\n\nI'm gonna give this game a gracious 6.5/10.","July 3, 2015","true","1.0"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

Your goal is to make these globs of goop fly across the screen doing different stunts and combos building up the highest score possible so that you can flaunt your score on the leader boards. A quick 15 minutes of playing somehow flashes before your eyes as you realize you have been playing for a few hours making a strategy and properly executing it for an attempt on the top score. The are different game modes if you'd like to mix it up, and it's an overall fun and solid game. It is easy to get hooked on it and get 7-10 hours of gameplay out of it, which is well worth the 10 dollars. You can definitely get more gameplay time through actively playing through all of the different level layouts and missions if you really get hooked on the game.\n\nYou can even record your gameplay ingame so that you can post it on the leaderboards for the ultimate boasting of your skill. It really reminds me of that type of competition you would get at the local arcade as you battled your friends indirectly for the top high score.\n\nIf a good mixture of arcade and puzzle games sounds appealing to you, this is a great purchase.

Through no fault of the game's own, it doesn't seem like it's found the player-base or market I feel like it deserves.  If you put this thing in a time machine and sent it back to the mid-90's, this would be exactly the kind of game my sister and I would sit and play for hours, trading off a controller and trying to one-up each other.\n\nAs far as gameplay goes, you have several stationary characters, Splatters, situated around an arena also filled with multiple small colored bombs, usually strung together or packed into clusters of tight formations.  When your Splatter smashes against a wall or other object, it will dissolve into a massive gush of liquid.  It's very physics-based, and you get lots of different effects by playing with different speeds and angles of approach, Your goal is to coat all of the bombs with the liquid.  However, the real goal is accumulation of points, which is accomplished by taking advantage of new game mechanics as they're introduced: stunts like sliding around curves or initiating secondary strikes in the air, manipulating time, combining smaller blobs to make larger more powerful blobs, comboing; all this stuff really comes together in ways where there's no one way to approach a levlel.\n\nHere's why its worth your time:\n\nFirst; it's polished!  Colors pop off of the screen!  Satisfying sound effects!  It's everything you would want in a casual title like this.  All of the controls are smooth on keyboard+mouse and even smoother with the Xbox controller.  There's a nice progression mechanic that keeps adding new stuff as you unlock new levels, and different level types to keep things fresh.\n\nIt's challenging!  Levels look simple, but you'll find yourself messing up or just scraping by an awful lot.  Until you practice.  There's always a way to get a higher score, and replaying levels until you get that one perfect shot is addictive.\n\nIt's fun!  It's perfect for dipping into for 20 minutes and then out again.  Never fret about the tutorials or unskippable story segments, just hold "F" or the bumper to major fast-forward through the whole thing.  This even works during level resets, too.\n\nThe verdict:  This game was given to me and I'm glad it was.  It's really good, and I wish I'd had it years ago.","November 13, 2015","true","3.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Not worth the $10 price tag, but still worth picking up if you can get it cheap.\n\nSuper Splatters is another one of those games I'd never heard of, but picked up in a gaming bundle. I'm always willing to give these obscure titles a try; sometimes you find a hidden gem. This game isn't exactly a diamond, but it isn't bad either.\n\nYou control blobs and use the environment and skills to slam your gooey goodness into bombs, trying to rack up combos for skill shots and clearing lots of bombs at one time. The game is simple, and is something you can easily kill an hour with.\n\nI enjoy that every level feels like it adds something new to the experience, but because of this, the developer felt the need to over-explain every new element through an "instructor," and these scenes are riddled with bad jokes and are incredibly boring to sit through. It really takes away from the fluid experience this game could otherwise offer.\n\nAs with most of these indie games, the pricetag is a little bit unreasonable to me. The game is entertaining, but it's not something I'd ever throw more than a couple of dollars at. If you can get it cheap, go for it - otherwise you probably won't feel like you got your money's worth.","December 13, 2015","true","3.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Imagine if Peggle had a more physics oriented engine and more aftertouch controls for your moves. Sliding your blobs around the level, switching directions, ramming them into spikes and making them spray their lovely goop all over the targets face is what should get you going. Other goals include having as high a combo multiplier by the end of the level, meeting stunt targets set out on the field or just getting as high of a score as possible.","June 29, 2013","true","3.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

You utilize combos,\nslides, swings, and different stunts to increase your score\nand increase the 'views' of each level.  Each level gets\nprogressively harder with its' physics and challenges\n\nThe game is entertaining, and relies heavily on leaderboards\nand encourages you to beat high scores as you complete each\nlevel.  It would be a good game to play with your friends and\ncompete for high score.\nIt can get a little repetitive as you replay a level several\ntimes as it increases in difficulty, and I found myself\nwishing that there were more variations in level design.\n\nWhen you accomplish your mission, the game does a good job of\nmaking you feel accomplished with its' rewards and achievements\n\nIt's a cute game, has a simple, solid game mechanic, and though\nI would have preferred that it had more levels, but for what\nit is, I can recommend this game.  See the video review for a\nmore in-depth review.\n\nFor more details, see the linked video review, as this is a basic summary of what I cover in my video.\nThanks for your viewership and support for more videos check click here.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/SocioPyscho","September 2, 2014","true","4.0"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","6","12","0","0"

I read reviews that are pretty darn positive of this game outside of the steam store and thought,wow! maybe I've stumbled on a hidden gem!\n\nSo i finally got it at massive discount in a bundle, and i was almost immediately bored with it. Which with the few other negative reviews on here seems to be the common connection. It looks colorful and exciting and everything you'd expect from a Nintendo offering, but then you play it and it's like your brain and your eyes are having opposite reactions. It looks like fun but it's just not fun to play.\n\nAlso like other reviewers, I didn't care for the dialogue and I also felt like the tutorial was kind of clunky, which put me off from first boot.\n\nbut hey.

So I'll try to be as fair as possible. By no means is it a -bad- game. The puzzles and mechanics are rather simple, but entertaining in their own right. it's just not a game I can recommend for people in my demographic. I'm sure this would be a great game for children or on a mobile device.\n\nThe graphics rub me the wrong way. If I were to explain why, I'd probably say the out of focus background and super high resolution foreground are a problem. I also disliked how they handled the tutorial sections. They were far-far too wordy and they tried to characterize the blobs. Let me explain, when I play a puzzle game or platformer I'm not interested in the story or reading at all. I'm merely looking for a game to play to keep my hands busy while I day-dream about other things or listen to a podcast. When I'm forced to read it requires my attention to be taken away from what I'm listening to or thinking about.\n\nOn the bright side the sound track was pretty hashtag dope!","June 23, 2015","false","2.8"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

It starts out easy, but don't let that turn you away. The game gets  incredibly hard  after it finishes teaching you the mechanics. If you ragequit easily, do not play the harder levels!\n\nthe premise is that you control a group of splatters trying to get big on TV. Every round there are firework pods all over the map. You can throw splatters at walls/floors etc and they will splat their juice everywhere. If their juice gets onto a firework pod it explodes into a coulerfull display, which gets you views. More views means more levels , stunts, and fun.\n\nHowever the game gets crazy after level 7, layering mechanic after mechanic to make this game anything but simple. Youll find yourself reversing the direction of everything to bring yourself backwards to hit some fireworks, launching yourself in midair to complete a jump, then pulling a "ballistic" to make everything explode. Its awesome, not only do you feel like a bada** but you look like one too.\n\nYou can even post your results and brag to your friends, or the world.\n\nOnly complaint is some levels are unrealisticley challanging.

I saw some reviews that said it was good so I'm playing it while I try to get my 100,000,000 badge for the Steam Monster Game.\n\nSo far, I am very impressed! The game looks nice, and is challenging enough. I recommend it for anyone who likes a little bit of strategy and a relaxed game. Very easy to get in to the game.\n\nI have played a bit over 2 hours at the time that I post this review and I have only "beaten" the easy stage (Easy, Medium, Hard). I say "beaten" because I have unlocked the medium stage, but I have yet to beat the other levels in the easy stage. Let alone get perfect scores on all of them.\n\nSo I would definitely say you get your money's worth from this game! Buy it.","June 19, 2015","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
