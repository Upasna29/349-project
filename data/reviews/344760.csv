I see a campfire and some dancing figures in the distance. I run towards them, hoping to make new friends and explore the world together.\n\nI approach them, cautiously. My time in DayZ has left me a little gun-shy in these survival games. They spammed a few wave emotes, so I came in closer and thought I'd join them.\n\nQueue Admiral Ackbar, "IT'S A TRAP!" One of them tossed several spears into my chest while the other clubbed me into submission.\n\nWell played, you savages.\n\nSpawn 2:\n\nDecide to completely avoid the beach area, and attempt to find shelter with the high king. Surely, he would not deny shelter to a loyal citizen of his kingdom. I run to the bridge, not seeing a single soul on my way there.\n\nI hop over their little hedge fence with little effort. It was cute though. So, +1 point for aesthetically-pleasing, but -1 point for lack of actual defensive-usefulness.\n\nI was greeted by the king's loyal guards, fully decked out in metal armor and weapons. I un-equip my club-like-thing, and yell into my mic, "I am here to serve my king! Long may he reign!"\n\nOne was walking around me, judging me, and seeing if I would be a problem. The other one equipped this long, brown item into his hands. "My word, good sir, that is a fine rope you have there!"\n\nNext thing I know, I am a ragdoll, completely left to the whim of my capturer. The laughter I brushed off early, should have been my early warning. He took me to their stockade, and locked me in. I was helpless. More laughter.\n\nThen, the one guard equipped the largest axe I have seen in game yet. And proceeded to chop my head off, despite my pleas against such an idea. I then heard them say, "Leave his body, as a warning to the rest."\n\nBefore I respawned, I saw the king apologize for his guard's poor behavior, and said he was "new" and "still in training." Followed by a strange term that must be for the upper echelon's of royalty in game. He used "lol". Surely, he meant "Lots of Luck" in my future lives. God bless him. Long may he reign, indeed.\n\nSpawn 3:\n\nSpawn on beach. Run inland, not towards castle. I find a huge wooden shelter that must have taken hours to build. I find a stray block on one wall, and jump into their base. Nothing fancy inside. But wait...\n\nA man in inside this base. He is sleeping. Had this been one of my first 2 spawns, I may have gone, "Oh, my word. This is your fort. My apologies." And then promptly left.\n\nBut this was not my first spawn. And this was not my second spawn. Third time's the charm, eh?\n\nI equip the beginning club, and proceed to bash this poor man's head in. His blood had lined the walls of his establishment. I loot his corpse/bag thing.\n\nJesus, this man was packing. Armor, food, water, weapons. He had it all. Unfortunate that he had to die this way. Oh well. Should have checked to see if he was truly safe before bedding himself. I took all his stuff. I equipped the armor and sword, and then hopped back outside.\n\nAnother armor-equipped man came running past shortly after. He complimented me. "That's a nice house you have there."\n\nWhy yes, yes it is.\n\nI am learning.\nI am evolving.\nSoon, all your bases are belong to me.\n\nI am Sir Gruffles, and this...\nThis is only the beginning.\n\nTL;DR: Died horribly in first 2 spawns. Learned from mistakes, killed sleeping man, and took his loot in third life.\n\n10/10: Can't wait to play again.\n\n\nUpdate 1:\n\nSpawn 4:\nMy knowledge is growing. I ran to an open field, built a hatchet, and began farming wood.\nBuilt a workstation and a campfire, and let it be open to all who approach for their use.\nMet some nice peasants, who seemed friendly enough. I taught them the ways of the craft.\n\nWe built armor, fed on the meat of sheep and rabbits, and defended our little plot of land against several attempts of savagery. It turns out, they were no savages. They were knights in disguise! Sent by his royal doucheness to stop any and all attempts at overthrowing him!\n\nIt was this, that sparked the revolution. We were a peaceful unit, thrown into the hell that is war. And he would pay dearly. We formed a guild, with me as its leader (probably cause I had a bit more knowledge of crafting than the others, and I was tallest). We were known throughout the land as, Band of Sirs.\n\nWe upgraded our benches and fires, until we could work with iron. We crafted better armor, and real weapons! The revolution was at hand!\n\nWe waited for the cover of nightfall to make the approach on the castle. With weapons in hand, my brothers and I stormed the bridge! There was no resistance at first....until we were faced with the worst enemy possible...a wooden wall and gate. We started striking the door with all our might, in an attempt to break it down.\n\nApparently, the king was right behind it! Because he and his 2 guards were laughing at our attempts to get through... The next thing we knew, they were on top of their post and their defense began. The rain of the javelins! My main were getting pierced with their wooden spikes of death. Our blood was creating a lake of death and despair the likes of which this realm has never withnessed.\n\nBut we also planted some of our own javelins firmly into the nads of our dear king! But he got cocky after that! With the king sword in hand, he jumped from that safety of his gate, right into the middle of my guild!\n\nApparently, his highness' sword is rather....long....and hurty. With one swing of his weapon, the first of my men perished. He fought to his dying breath. The other 2 of my men yelled out in pain, yet continued to throw spears into the king. I unsheated my iron sword and engaged!\n\nI parryed the next swing of his sword, and took a swing of my own. It connected! The king was bleeding! We had hope! Until his highness ran past me, and cut down another member of my guild. The next thing I knew, the last member of my guild was also dead. It was just me and the king.\nI lasted longer than I thought I would. I parryed many of his swings. Alas, my stamina was too low to maintain a proper defense. I would fall, alongside my brothers.\n\nUpon death, the king declared he was one more swing from my sword away from death. He honored our brave attempts at overthrowing him, but making taxes 0% for a day. Well played, your majesty. For now.\n\nSpawn 5 in comments :D\n\nWhile Spawn 5 story is def worth a read, here's a TL;DR:\n\nSaid F IT to strategy. Ran to gate again. Found traitor from guild as gate guard. King saw us with nothing, said we werent a threat, and let us in. Bashed another sleeping guard's head in. Took armor and weapons. Started usurping. One guard and traitor came to stop me. Traitor yells out "ITS A DOUBLE CROSS!" And attacked other guard! We double teamed him and killed him! THE KING WAS HAVING CONNECTION ISSUES! I usurped again and I became the new king!\n\nALL HAIL KING GRUFFLES!\n\nLong may I reign.\n\nI thank the men of Band of Sirs for their loyalty and sacrifice. You will not be forgotten.\n\n(3/24/15) Uploaded 2 highlights to Twitch channel and YouTube. Spawns 4 & 5 are shown. Hope you all can get a few more laughs from them ^.^.

At the current state of this game, I'm going to have to say no. No, you should not buy this game, and here's a short explanation why you shouldn't.\n\nFirst, let me clarify that I'm not some squeaker that bought this game last week with daddy's credit card. I've played this game since alpha 5. I've witnessed the rise and fall of trolling hackers with admin-like abilities, and I remember the beginning of the Asian Invasion of torch jumpers. I've played/enjoyed/wasted over 1000 hours on this game.\n\nReasons Why You Shouldn't Purchase This Game:\n\n1. Scenario: You play the game for 4 hours building a modest base with sound security. You log for the evening. The next day, you find that you are dead and your base is completely gone. You deduce that your base was raided while you were offline. You are angry, but you decide to build another base. The previous scenario happens another 3 or 4 times over the next week. Base building starts to seem trivial.\n\nThe Devs solution to this problem is some sort of totem system that protects your crest and a small portion of your base while you are offline. That's almost akin to putting a bandaid on a broken leg. The problem lies with who is playing on the server, and by who, I mean region or more specifically, time zone. For example, if people from a completely different time zone (think China) play on a North American server consistently, the vast majority of people will be offline when the vast majority of the opposing time zone(r)s are on. This creates a raid imbalance of sorts. The solution would be region locking the serves. The Devs are trying to solve this is a round about way by booting people with high pings, but i'm sure there will be ways around that which leads me to my next point.\n\n2. Combat System: If you and the person you are fighting have a ping of 100ms or less, PvP is quite enjoyable. But, if you're fighting someone with a 200ms + ping (and yes this happens on a daily basis - that whole region thing again), the player with the high ping has a great advantage over you. Imagine getting headshot from 20 meters away.\n\n3. Seige Equipment: At this point, siege equipment no longer seems balanced. An average person with a trebuchet can destroy a decent base with thick walls in about 5 minutes. There was a time when a good castle could last a week or maybe 2. Nowadays, a castle usually doesn't survive one siege attempt.\n\n4. Player Base: Any way you cut it, the player base is shrinking. Thus, servers have been shutdown. If seems that if this trend continues, this game will not survive. I'm not sure if it will make it our of early access.\n\nDevs, if you are reading this, shields and bucklers will not protect us from hacks or lagging players from other regions. That is what is choking your game. Wake up before RoK is DoA.\n\n","August 1, 2015","false","815.2"," 1,188 of 1,311 people (91%) found this review helpful 78 people found this review funny","91","188","1","78","70"

It's great. I love building things, I love raiding, I love fighting in PvP. The game has a long way to go but it's a blast.\n\nHOWEVER.\n\nThis game is plagued by hackers. A problem that their Anti Cheat does not help with, nor do the developers really seem to care about the hacking problem.\n\nOne day I was in my base organizing my resources and I hear my chests opening, it was just me in my base, I saw nobody. So I knew something was wrong, I check my chests...and they are all EMPTY. Next thing I know, I was insta killed. Everything was taken, and soon after the rest of the server was crying out that a hacker was killing them. All that progress, weeks of progress....lost.\n\nAnother instance, is I was farming Iron, a man in full steel tries to kill me though I am much faster since I am naked and I actually got away. I was watching him though and I see him stop running, a few seconds after he stopped running I dropped dead and he proceeded to my dead body and looted my resources. Another isnta death.\n\nThe hackers ruin the game, therefore I would not recommend this game in its current state UNLESS you plan on paying for your own server, which you shouldn't have to do to enjoy this game.\n\nYou will lose hours and hours of progress to someone using a cheat and typing in an admin command that they should not have any access to, all in just a few seconds.\n\nI hope one day I can come back to this game, and maybe when the game isn't plagued with hacks and exploits I will recommend this game.","January 23","false","453.4"," 616 of 663 people (93%) found this review helpful 34 people found this review funny","93","616","663","34","24"

An island with a throne. An objective of becoming the King. What I expected was a Game of Thrones with guilds of players working together to capture territory and to install their leader as King. Backstabbing and intrigue. And lone wolfs just trying to survive amidst it all. What I actually got was Lord of the Flies reenacted by the inmates of Aylesbury Young Offenders Institute.\n\nI started off, found some abandoned half destroyed ruin in a forest at the edge of the island and started building it up. Repaired the walls. Built new facilities inside. Got killed finding resources but I learned from it. Built iron doors. Built a stone outer wall. Things were going great!\n\nYou use crests to mark territory, and I had a basic leather one in my base. This makes it so players cannot remove blocks from your house so if they want in they have to force entry.\n\nI had acquired the resources for an iron one which marks a wider amount of space so I could have a big thick stone wall around my base for protection. Unfortunately you can only have 1 crest at a time even if it's in your own territory so to replace the crest I had to remove my previous one and place a new one, accepting 10 minutes of complete vulnerability until it remarked the territory.\n\nSo I remove my crest and put the new iron one down. At that moment 10 (not kidding) japanese players in iron armour came storming over, tore down my walls and took my items while I hid in my panic room. Stepping out I noticed the devestation and ina fury ran out in my steel armour with ym steel greatsword. Naturally this didn't end well for me\n\nI was then informed that these people are hackers who ruin the game for everyone and scrolling down through the reviews I noticed that this is a common problem.\n\nYou know, up until that point I would have given this game another glowing review. But the destruction of hours and hours of my hard work have left me in an understandably bitter mood and the developers attitude towards the hacking problem doesn't help.\n\nSo 8/10 before the hack and 0/10 post-hack due to the game being unplayable. DO NOT BUY!\n\nEdit: Against my better judgement I decided to give this game another try. Spent hours building a new base and then a new patch was released, wiping the servers and destroying my work. So I spent many more hours building another base, had to answer the phone while I was out finding resources and since your character goes to sleep in the game when you log out I logged back in to find I had been killed while I was away having a life. Got back to my base to find 2 lovely chaps had not only taken over my base but had also built a prison outside and put someone in it. Now my base was made out of wood with a top tier iron door outside. For a new player with limited access to resources (and since the stone quarry is swarming with heavily armed players looking for newbies to kill) this is basically the best I could achieve. I even put my crest inside the walls so they would have to tear them down to find it if they wanted to take over. Naturally this didn't stop these 2, whether it was hacks or high level equipment they somehow got in, found and destroyed my crest. Since the walls seemed intact they either rebuilt them exactly or they simply hacked it, most likely the latter.\n\nTried to force entry into my own home and they both came out. My attacks passed through them doing no damage and eventually I died. Please for the love of god DON'T GET THIS GAME!!!\n\nFinal Edit:\n\nSo after I pulled myself together I decided to give it one final try with two objectives, retake my base and be crowned as Queen!\n\nI made a new base nearby my old one, gathered my power there then forced entry and retook it, leaving the miserable gits who took it handcuffed and sealed in a cobblestone box.\n\nWith that unpleasantness out of the way I turned my attention towards the throne at which point the server promptly shut down, one of about 2/3 of all the servers that were shut down!\n\nSo I joined another server, built a new base, then when I logged back in later all traces of my base had vanished and I was now playing as a fat bald man....\n\nSensing a pattern I decided not to bother building anything anymore since between server wipes, game breaking errors, servers shutting down and high level players you are lucky if anything you build lasts a few hours.\n\nSomeone had built a cobblestone wall on the bridge to the castle but I was able to get around it by building a skybridge. Passing through there I was immediately ganged up on and killed by 2 steel clad people. The only other 2 people on the server. Apparently they just wait there with the patience of the ancients for someone to log in, get through or around their stone wall, and then get killed by them both.\n\nSo I jumped servers and found a castle with a massive wall on it and a lot of player activity. I decided to get around this by gathering many cheap blocks and building a staircase behind the castle up to the top, no mean feat since the rock the castle stands on must be about 200 blocks tall! Fortunately I didn't need to waste much time on this because I ran into a bug where every approx 5 minutes my screen goes black forcing me to log out and in again, and if I was in the sea I drop to 40 fathoms below it and drown before I can get back up again\n\nNext server had nothing on the bridge but a couple of steel clad foul mouthed kiddies. After getting massacred the first time I came up with a plan. I made a bed and ran past them, placed it down behind a rock then did an Obi Wan and lowered my club as they slaughtered me with cries of noob and nigerian.\n\nSo they ran off back to the front of the bridge to await their next victim while I respawned at the bed. I then spent 45 minutes clubbing my way through the wooden wall they had built to block entrance to the castle and seized the throne before they could get back to stop me! At that moment I felt something like overcoming an especially tough boss in Dark Souls!\n\nI think I know now why the game ended up so far from it's vision. The game trailers give a fair amount of attention to the presences of ropes, shackles, cages and torture devices, which are clearly present for the sake of bullying and griefing. Of course these things do exist in the Medieval era and I gave it little thought. But when a bully watches that trailer they will be drawn to the game by the promise of these griefing tools.\n\nIn practice they lack the patience to craft the necessary facilities to produce these things, and simply travel in gangs attacking lone players and destroying their work with their clubs. What's more the game artwork displays caracatures of bloated troll like men acting like monkeys and the in-game character customisation option not only allows for exaggerated anatomy, but the pvp meta is of a pitch black midget with maximum size arms for the smallest target to hit with the longest reach. In the end the game advertising appeals to exactly these sorts of people who drive away everyone else and leave the community a toxic cesspool.\n\nSo I suppose in the end this game is like Dark Souls meets Lord of the Flies, except the hollows are obscenity spewing bullying ganging adolescents, and the bosses are server wipes, servers closing and game breaking bugs. That all said, I'm glad I can finally uninstall this ordeal with peace of mind that I didn't let it break me :)","May 28, 2015","false","98.3"," 1,421 of 1,639 people (87%) found this review helpful 444 people found this review funny","87","421","1","444","152"

However, as the game's age went from a day old (bought the game on day 2 of release) to a week old to two weeks old...people started cracking the code and made *dun dun dun* hacking clients.\n\nTo be honest, even though this game is Early Access it doesn't give the developers an excuse to not implement an anti-hack system. I know that they didn't expect this game to blow up as it has, but on the same token if I were a game developer I would add VAC or EAC before releasing.\nI haven't seen many hackers (quite frankly only speed hackers) but I have gone AFK to find my home that I spent 3 hours on (people that say they spent 10 hours on a house are overexagerating, 3 hours is sufficient for a good home) and my inventory completely ravaged and destroyed. This was due to a hacker.\n\nIf any of you that are reading this are very well experienced into video games (i.e. 4+ years) you would know that "hackers" are 12 year old kids that think they're anonymoose for searching up "reign of kings hacks" on Google and downloading something off of ♥♥♥♥. Well, the real hackers (the ones who code the hacks) are usually 20 years plus, and probably make those downloadable files full of trojans, so fear not; the prepubescents and little kids are probably ruining their Dad's desktop. However, with the many hacks available, and not every single one being malicious, it's hard for all hackers to see problems with their computer in the future, so no justice will come their way. There will always be hackers if there is a malfunction in the game. The fix? Don't play the game for another week or so. If Code}{atch doesn't implement anti-cheat within the week, drop the game and never buy from them again, as this would be their second strike. I will personally be wiping my story above and making my review negative if they don't add anti-cheat.\n\nTo the hackers out there, hacking a video game and ruining another's good time and $20.00 is usually a sign of extreme insecurity, boredom (means you have no friends if you're hacking a game like this), and jerkking off for the rest of your life. Just don't.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/datreyderr/recommended/344760/","datreyderr","GAPE","http://steamcommunity.com/id/datreyderr/","46 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis game has been on a slow but sure decline ever since its Alpha release. There have been no signs of improvement or polishing, no hint of upcoming authentic features to rekindle the dying player base--Nothing.\n\nAll the developers have ever done to "fix" crucial bugs has been removing content from the game, mostly whatever content enables that bug to exist and leaving it at that. Or they simply circumnavigate the problem by throwing together a crude solution, such as Totems.\n\nTotems were added to the game because bases were being taken out in minutes by players that could glitch through walls. What the totem does is make a crest--the object you place to own territory and blocks--invulnerable. So without a crest, whatever you construct is up for grabs by anyone. Well, they fixed the wall-glitching bug (the actual issue) by disabling a feature, but with the hasty addition of totems (now rendered unnecessary) players are left with a drastically different game.\n\nNo longer does it matter how good you are at legimately infiltrating a base, or sieging a castle...the defender will always hold fast and recover before you even bring their loot back to your place. Why? Because even if you clean out your enemy's chests, their biggest investment--the blocks of their base--can't be taken.\n\nSo, sieging has been reduced to tediously making dents in someone's walls because the owners can keep their crest up indefinitely with totem protection. Totems are so easy to craft they could be made by a freshly spawned player within 15 minutes. One totem gives 24 hours of protection to your crest, but they may be stacked 2 more times.\n\nThis is just one example of the cheap maneuvering the developers pull to deal with an issue, and it also shows their complete lack of foresight and inability to comprehend what players actually need or what they enjoy.\n\nReign of King's one saving grace left, however, is its combat. While just as engaging but not as refined as Chivalry Medieval Warfare, individual experience and skill really stands out in a player. But even the combat aspect of the game is starting to deterioriate. The recently added shields are more like all-encompassing protective domes that have a few indeterminate holes in them, and kicking (the even newer addition and counter to shields) is so pathetically useless and weak that it is a sure liablity in combat and it will get you killed.\n\nAnd sieging...sieging is done for as well. Even if totems weren't implemented, sieging would be fruitless and agonizingly cumbersome. Trebuchet aim fluctuates between here, the moon, and Pluto, so good luck lining up a shot because it will miss and it will miss miserably. Ballistas are just as dire. Even point-blank, a ballista will not damage what you aim at...\n\nOh, so you figured out how many bolts you need to take out an iron door? Oh, actually, you're gonna need 500 instead of 90, because the ballista bolt is actually phasing through the door and hitting a block yards behind the door.\n\nTo sum up, this game is a sinking ship, and the captain and crew are keeping all the lifeboats to themselves. So don't buy this, unless you want to drown... in your own tears.\n\nEDIT: And hackers now rule every server. So basically this game is now a gaping void with no fun or actual players.","September 28, 2015","false","947.7"," 407 of 470 people (87%) found this review helpful 29 people found this review funny","87","407","470","29","27"

The king gets to set taxes that other players pay as they gather materials, high taxes really motivate people to overthrow the king, but also make it a lot harder for to collect materials.\n- Proximity voicechat\n- When you log out you turn into a "Sleeper", ie your avatar is replaced with a guy in a sleeping bag and people can kill you if they can reach you. So log out in the safety of your territory or find a really good hiding place.\n- You can tie people up with rope and imprison them or send them to the gallows\n- You can make crossbows, bows, siege equipment\n- Weapons, armor, and blocks are all tiered (wood, leather, stone, iron, steel | dirt, grass, clay, wood, stone, stone slab)\n\nWhat I don't like about it\n- The combat is like Chivalry - good thing is you can block and there is a stamina bar. But many fights end up as run around the person hitting or kiting. You can choose which way you swing horizontally, but it's purpose is more so you don't hit a wall or tree while you swing. No directional blocking.\n- Very little inventory space and the containers chests are quite small too.\n\nNot many negatives. I've only had one game breaking bug occur in 14 hours. A couple smaller bugs. It's a fun game and for $20 bucks I've already got my moneys worth.\n\nToday two knuckleheads tried to break down my gate. I stood on my wall shooting arrows at them. One guy managed to doublejump (it's possible to do against blocks) on to my wall and began running around my base. I ran behind him slashing him with my 2h steel axe. After he was dealt with I went back to the 2nd guy still hacking away at my gate and asking him to leave. He demanded a fair fight so I obliged and engaged him in a duel. After a few well time blocks and swings, he was dispatched as well.\nWent back inside and made myself a chicken leg. Good game.","March 14, 2015","true","32.3"," 451 of 531 people (85%) found this review helpful 169 people found this review funny","85","451","531","169","0"

If you are looking for a medieval combat game, I would recommend Chivalry: Medeival Warfare. And if you are looking for a survival game with base building and very similar features to this, I would recommend Rust (even though I have not put many hours into Rust since that major update while back)\n\nedit:\nThe fact that you need at minimum a 64-bit computer with an Intel core i5, a full 6GB of RAM and a GPU that appears no where near as low as I would expect for something that looks visually this unappealing. My computer is well over the recommended requirements and I got horrendous amounts of lag when looking at certain areas (not even on the top graphics settings).\n\nConclusionI would not recommend this game or any of the developers work.\nThis game along with many other survival games (often made simply in unity, and with assets taken from the unity asset store) has "POTENTIAL" and with what Steam is becoming now, potential just doesn't seem good enough for anything in my opinion.\n\nWarning this bit starts to rant more on what gets into steam!\n\nThere are a large amount of games being greenlit as jokes e.g. Grass Simulator. (Who at steam allowed that crap to get into steam after it being greenlit???)\n\nVALVE, WHERE IS YOUR CONTENT MODERATION?! Where have your standards gone?\n\n- Sinister Sloth Minister (John Key of New Zealand)\n\nedit 2 (if some of this does not make sense read comments):\nI will now point out, survival games would not be my favourite genre (my favourite would be story rich and in-depth games), I do however continue to play the DayZ mod for ArmA II (I would compare Reign of Kings to Rust but I have not played Rust all too much sinch it's major update a while ago, so I am not in a position to compare the two) and for me Reign of Kings does not live up to the same enjoyment, exploration and accomplisment as DayZ does.\nYes Reign of Kings does have very unique features (the taxing system and it trys to bring a large amount of roleplay to the game, but unfortunatly I was not able to see this), these bring the game a great deal of potential but unfortunatly it just wasn't executed as well as it could have been.\n\nThis is entirely my opinion. Feel free to share yours, but please don't go all fanboy on me though ;)\n\nedit 3 (so many edits :D. Some positive points! Also this might be messy as I am tired and hungry :P):\nAs MrJoe has pointed out in a comment, I was incorrect with some of my claims about game updates and content updates (there was one a few days ago).\nMrJoe also points out that Reign of Kings is in a much better state than other Alphas on Steam (main reason why I am not so fond of Steam's "Early Access") like DayZ standalone.\nAs I have not played much of this game [Reign of Kings] for a while, I have been told this game has been changing in each update.\n\nI may not recommend this game in it's current state as there are other survival games that are in a better state than this. But I will revisit this review much later to determine whether this game deserves my recommendation or now.\n\nAlso there are many negative reviews based around their experiences playing the game (e.g. blah blah, base raided and everything lost, blah blah), I would like to address these reviews. These people are all talking about gameplay issues, in this games state this is going to be an issue for some people due to the game not being fully balanced (gameplay issues with safe zones, clan flag (I think it's called that, can't remember the name off the top of my head) and other bugs). These reviews are mostly ignorable as I would assume that these would be some of the dev's concerns.\n\n- Sinister Sloth Minister (John Key of New Zealand)\n\np.s. there will be no more edits :P","July 9, 2015","false","5.6"," 737 of 904 people (82%) found this review helpful 27 people found this review funny","82","737","904","27","45"

However, unless you are online 24/7 or have an international guild, you cannot maintain a base.  My friends and I have build good multi layered cobblestone+ bases that are completely leveled when we log off and go to sleep.  A steel crest with 6 layers of cobblestone will not prevent it.\n\nThe developers need to come up with a solution for the middle of the night base destruction.  For instance, in real life if you were asleep, and someone attacks your base, you'd wake up.  But when you log off the game and go to bed, you're screwed.  There is no balance for this.  It's simply not fun to spend a week gathering stone, iron and wood to build one of the strongest bases in the game just to have it all wiped out because someone else doesn't go to bed the same time you do.\n\nIdeas:\n\n1.  How about Once a person logs off, the block hit-points are incrementally increased by a factor of 120.  Each hour you are offline they decrease by a factor of 5.  So blocks with normal hitpoints of 3000 would have 360,000 for the first hour - 180,000 hit-points 6 hours later and 3,000 hitpoints after 24 hours.  This would help both the legitimate seasoned players as well as the new players defend against griefers and midnight attackers.\n\n2.  Implement a killcam so if your base is leveled in the middle of the night, you can at least see who did it and how they did it.  I have a sneaking suspicion the last base level was not legit and possibly a hack.  My friend said they used gunpowder kegs (which is currently disabled in this version of the game.)  But there's no way to know because there's no telling what happened.  Hint: even in medieval times people would know who leveled a town.  Why not in this game?\n\nSo unless you like gathering resources and building bases just to have them destroyed immediately I can't recommend this game in it's current state.\n","July 18, 2015","false","221.8"," 377 of 450 people (84%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","84","377","450","14","14"

There are many other glaring issues and features that could have been looked at. Also there is no real benefit to doing either of these when you can kill and cook wild animals or just live off berries (which I did constantly).\n\nAt the end of the day after the population went from thousands to hundreds they slapped a done badge on it and called it a day.

To be honest they have made some improvements to the game. Not really anything groundbreaking or worthy of being mentioned, but they changed a few things.\n\nBut that being said the game is filled with cheating issues still and with only 2 maps that don't even have random recource generation it's kind of pathetic.\n\nGood luck enjoying the public servers. 1st 2 hours, I build a nice little camp, have some walls started and out of no where 3 guys appeared and killed me and then proceeded to tear down my entire place and take everything I owned. But determined to persevere I pushed on and started anew, convinced that I was in a location not many would travel through. I'm minding my own business when I just die. No one is nearby, just die. So I try to contact an admin, next thing I know I'm banned. No reason given, just banned.\n\nWell determined to still enjoy this game a little bit more I move to private custom servers. They are a little better, some of the servers honor the non kos rules but some don't even have admins in game so many are running amok and the larger servers are pretty much entirely russian so no chance of communication there. So I start my own private locked server and after getting it all set up I set out to build a giant castle in the middle of the new map... I get about an hour into it and the game drops to the desktop and the server disapeared as well... I then decided to sumarily uninstal the game and write this review.\n\n-1/10 for basically everything.","December 21, 2015","false","9.9"," 295 of 369 people (80%) found this review helpful 39 people found this review funny","80","295","369","39","20"

When everything is working as it should, the combat is extremely satisfying, especially for us gore lovers. Want to lop off your opponents head? How's about their arms and legs? Even after all that is said and done, anything that they were carrying is now yours for the taking! ( The friends that I do play with have told me this game's combat is similar to that of Chivalry's, so if you like that I'm sure you'll enjoy this )\n\n2. I'm not one for long drawn out executions, but if you are, this game has just about every tool you'll need to make your enemies wish they'd never messed with you! Once you've captured your opponent, you'll have a list of humiliation/torture/execution devices to chose from. From the gallows to the guillotine, you name it, they've got it.\n\n3. Perhaps you want to play some music before battle or just insure that everyone knows of your presence. If so, you should go and craft yourself a long horn, and maybe even a drum or two. That'll keep em on their feet!\n\n4. Although I'm not much into roleplay, you'd have to be blind to not see the amount of potential this game has for it. If you're into rp, you'll find an abundance of community servers just for you.\n\n5. The character creator is incredibly goofy. ( Which isn't a bad thing in this case ) From the tallest, skinniest, big chin...iest person you've ever seen. To the most pregnant, hulkiest, shortest guy you'll never meet. You can really make just about whatever kind of character you want.\n\nCONS:\n\n1. The video shown may include large scale ffa combat, but you'd be hard pressed to find a single situation that doesn't involve a 10v1. ( Unless you're with friends )\n\n2. The combat itself is incredibly inconsistant, especially with the hardcore desync issues that are still present within the game. Even in servers where my ping is below 10, it can get pretty bad. It's basically, "Whoever is laggier wins". ( And that's after all of the updates leading up to version 10 )\n\n3. Despite the recent efforts from Code}{atch to stop cheaters from ruining the game, they can still be found in just about every server you join. That being said, there have been several instances of people being banned for using modified dll's.\n\n4. The engine isn't the greatest. ( Or rather; they're use of the engine isn't the greatest ) You'll find people double jumping and sometimes triple jumping directly over your walls. From boosting onto another person's head, to making siege workshops and hopping clean over a 15 block high wall. ( Even if they're within your crest's borders )\n\n5. Fighting anywhere near your opponents base is almost always fruitless. If you do any significant amount of damage to them, they'll simply run into their base and instantly close the door behind them. ( Sometimes having two or more doors in order to trap you inside ) Most recently people have been excluding doors from their builds entirely. Simply removing their own blocks to enter/exit the base, then replacing them.\n\n6. The building mechanics can be and most often are, abused. Have a trebuchet and want to tear down someone's walls? Too bad, they can rebuild everything you've destroyed faster than you can reload. ( Unless you have several people helping you. Even then it's tedious ) Lest you have an unimaginable amount of ammo for your trebuchet, good luck making any progress.\n\n7. This game is riddled with performance issues at the moment. Code}{atch has been releasing updates to try and fix that, so hopefully this shouldn't be a problem in the future.\n\nTLDR;\nIf you can't tolerate the sometimes inconsistant combat, bad and occasionally horrible mechanics,\n"hackers"/cheaters, several glitches present in each update ( Often seen in Early Access games ), and in most cases a terrible community ( Based on which server you join ), I'd stay away from this game until it's had some time to progress.\n\nKeep in mind; this review is based on the current state of the game ( Version 10 ) and things are bound to change in the future!","April 2, 2015","false","185.6"," 477 of 648 people (74%) found this review helpful 28 people found this review funny","74","477","648","28","30"

I do however recommend you do your research on ANY developer before personally supporting them in an Early Access title. If their past issues put a huge red flag up for you I do not blame you and I recommend you look elsewhere regardless of the games current state.\n\nThat being said let's critque the actual current build of the game. I am writing this on 3/11/2015 and have had press access for around a week now.\n\nCrafting: Crafting is really well done and the amount of things you can craft right now is honestly amazing for an early access title. Pretty much everything you see in the world alive/dead can be used for some sort of recipe. There is siege weapons, torture weapons, and a decent selection of major building blocks for castle/house creation. Another HUGE plus is that crafting stations like fireplaces and benches are able to be picked up which makes moving very easy.\n\nThe World: Although quite small the world does feel well thought out. There is some absolutely beautiful scenery in this game and I find certain parts of the world hold rarer resources (for example one side of the map may have an abundance of rocks but no flax to be found). I like that it makes moving pretty much needed.\n\nCombat: Having only tested combat once I am definitely not a guru on this subject but it did feel quite decent, latency definitely affects projectiles quite drastically and might be an issue for some people expecting super smooth combat. Overall with melee I had no major complaints but it can be improved.\n\nBuilding: Building just fine, my only complaint is if you misplace a block theres no delete option and you have to sit there for 5 minutes whacking it to get rid of it so take you time placing them. This would also make rearranging a nightmare.\n\nPolitics: Politics atleast right now seem very basic with one king ruler who can impose a tax and claim the land name. You also get a crown and very decent sword. I did not see any way to form a guild so I cannot mention much about that now.\n\nGathering: Gathering in this game is very well done. Upgraded or gathering-focused weapons yield more per hit and the way trees fall and break is very rewarding, you visually can see how much is left in a resource and it makes gathering kind of enjoyable.\n\nSurvival: This is where I think this game went a little wrong. I don't see the need for survival mechanics personally. It is very hard at the start unless you have a good spawn point with an abundance of berries. I would rather see future developement focus on political warfare and creation aspects, I feel survival will feel more like a nuisance than fun for most casual players.\n\nSever Size: Currently the server size is EXTREMELY small to keep with the map size I assume (I think it's 28 players). This is a huge downside to me, when it comes to medieval warfare you want huge battles with 100's of people.

This game is a cruel, cruel mistress. You will spend hours on end making the perfect base, walls, castles, you name it. It will be everything you ever imagined, or maybe even better. All the while you will have scars and experience that will stay with you till death. And despite the hackers, the people basing next to the main resource spawns, and the autists who roleplay and yell at everyone else to roleplay (despite the fact that they build floating bases instead of castles cause they don't wanna get raided) you will ultimately have fun. Should you be playing with friends then there's a good chance that you will become the kingpins of the server. And then, out of the blue, you will raid the wrong group of people, and their one salty friend with hacks will slay everybody on the server hundreds of times, destroy your base, and fly away, without getting banned and with no way to report them because they kept changing their names.\n\nBottom line is that this game is good. Buggy and filled with hackers, but good.

A lot of YouTubers were posting fun gameplay videos so I broke and bought it.\n\nThe world is beautiful. The landscape feels like an actual land, the trees and shadows are well done, the foliage and shrubbery looks and feels great. There are ducks, sheep, chickens, elk, deer, wolves, bears, and "werewolves" (spiky mutant wolves) to fight/kill and harvest fangs, leather, wool, meat, fat, etc from. Crafting is your standard crafting: collect enough resources and pick from a menu. There is a kind of technology tree in that you upgrade your work benches from basic -> +tanning -> +stonecutting, etc. Chopping trees is strangely satisfying as they fall over then you keep chopping them to pieces. Mining is boring - there are only a handful of static nodes that respawn after a few minutes. Building is great. There are a lot of options and different materials with properties like some are more durable obviously but some others (like stone and metal reinforced wood) can only be damaged by siege equipment. I honestly really, really enjoyed harvesting resources, upgrading my tools, and planning out my little base and defenses.\n\nThat said: This game is a total piece of ♥♥♥♥. You can spend hours working on a base, literally hours (hours), only to have it destroyed and lost in ten minutes. There is only one map that's just a small island that you can run across in a few minutes. The neutral wildlife AI just runs the opposite direction from you when you attack and the hostile AI is borderline ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥... they "slow motion" straight for you and swing at the air in front of them a few times once they get close enough, after they've slid down hills and gotten stuck on any minor divet in the terrain. You can hop up on a block and they can't even touch you as you poke them to death while they swipe harmlessly at your feet. Combat is abysmal - You never know if you're going to hit or miss. Even if you feel like you're going to connect, the character animations pivot and lunge weirdly as you're strafing each other and you can't really gauge the reach of your weapon. If you're decent at landing shots, a fast weapon automatically beats any powerful weapon, because hitting them first interrupts their swing. People wordlessly attack 90% of the time and a majority of my interactions were running for my life while having javelins thrown at my back. Some will give up after a short distance but a fair amount will chase you forever. Seriously. For 20 minutes. Up a mountain, into the ocean, doesn't matter. Another joy is being captured, which sounds fun until you're on the receiving end and minding your own business when suddenly your character falls helpless on the ground and someone drags you away because you weren't listening closely enough for footsteps. Now you're in a cage or some stocks and at the mercy of some 12 year old as your character slowly starves to death and you debate about using the sharp stone you've hidden in your butt (yes, really) to smash your own face in.. but you have all this stuff on you that you'll lose. IMO the king is pointless and typically ignored unless he raises the tax rate enough to irritate people. There's no reason to be king other than to be king and it's hard to get resources because people try to kill you, so you have to use the taxed resources but if you raise the tax too high they'll all band together and come to kill you. A few servers I've been on actually went several hours without ANY king because no one even cared. Hacking is also rampant, since this is a client-side game. There have been flying people throw javelins from the sky and spawning a half dosen werewolves right on top of you, invisible people one-shotting players then deleting their houses, and more.\n\nI had a game going on a public server, until I logged in yesterday and every house on the server was gone--deleted by hackers. All of the forges, chests, workbenches, etc were still there floating in the air but the houses and structures had been deleted. So tonight after working all day I started a new game on a fresh server. Over the next 8 hours I chopped trees and tried to catch ore veins everyone was competing for while dodging person after person trying to capture me (because the admin put a "no kill on sight" rule in play but said capturing was fine). For eight hours. Until finally I had a decent little base going, made of metal reinforced wood so people would have to use siege equipment to break in, and I had the base split into three different rooms separated by strong metal doors so if they did break in, hopefully they wouldn't be able to get into all 3 areas and clean me out. I was on my way back with some resources when I discovered three guys using a ballista at point blank range to smash down just two blocks, enough room for them to squeeze into my first room. I didn't know there were three and jumped in after them swinging my swords, but ducked back out after seeing I was outnumbered. I figured that's fine, whatever, they'll get my resources, who cares... but after healing I came back again to find the one smashing my crest which gave me ownership of the area, then all they'd have to do is put down one of their own to steal the entire thing from me. I jumped in again to try to stop him but got overwhelmed again, so I took off into the mountains and this time they chased. I ended up in a 3vs1 fight, two of them throwing javelins and the other with a large axe, a hole in the side of my base, my resources gone, and soon the entire base gone. Within 15 minutes.\n\nNo thanks. I'm done. Buy this game if you want for lulz, but each time you log in, everything you had could be gone. Another thing I heard pointed out is that this is the same company that made Starforge, which they left completely screwed and failed to deliver on any of their promises. We'll see how much hope Reign of Kings has in the future. For now, I'm done.","April 25, 2015","false","28.5"," 317 of 448 people (71%) found this review helpful 40 people found this review funny","71","317","448","40","19"

No way, forget.\n\nHi, there. My name is Dmitriy and i'm administrator for Reign of Kings Red Sky Server Pack. You can know me or my servers as PUBLIC, DEATHMATCH, RUS RP and others.\nWe always take 1st places at player count list of community servers.\n\nI started to host our first server at 5th of May and host it till today. Since this time i had problem with voice chat. Every time I tried to talk into a microphone - was a very high chance that the game will throw me from any server in the main menu. The same problem was once next to me says a voice chat someone else.\nOf course, I've created a few topics in the discussions which described in detail the problems that arise, but so far no reply has been received. Moreover, so far I have not received a reply on emails sent to e-mail support@codehatch.соm August 8 with a detailed description of several problems and accompanying screenshots. Most of the problems encountered by the players have to deal with the players and OXIDE plugin developers.\n\nThe problem of the presence of cheaters detail paint will not, affected only one sentence - there is a problem, and in 3 minutes the presence of cheater on the server, it can cause irreparable damage to the economy or destroy key objects like chests king.\n\nOn the problem of serious checks and freezes the game also mention - after 2 weeks of playing on the development, the popular server game world oversaturated blocks so that the only true solution is a complete cleaning of the world every 2 weeks as further comfortable playing without this action is simply impossible. Regardless of the power equipment used to host a game server, the problem remains the same.\n\nIn this connection, I consider it necessary to declare that the game developers are not interested in communicating with the community, are not ready to help players solve the problems with the game and as a result are not interested in the development and promotion of the game. Result - 491 players in the game at the time of writing the message. The result - 66% discount on the game, and such discounts are placed only for obsolete or useless games.\n\nUnfortunately, the developers due to reasons known to me have missed a great opportunity to make candy out of the game, leaving a very unfinished product every 2 weeks under the guise of a formal update, which brings extremely (sarcasm) a lot. The fact that the game has moved to the beta version, suggests that players should not expect a fundamentally new content in the near future.\n\nAt the current stage of the game I and our community Red Sky (over 300 people) do not consider it necessary to recommend this product to new players before the policy makers to rethink communication and support for players and further plans for the game. Those who wish to buy the game, I recommend that users pay the most popular view projects in this genre.\n(The author is responsible for the reviews posted every word.\nPreparation of the text was carried out using the service Google Translate.)\n\nAuthor: Dmitriy (ingame nickname - Beyond Kayne).\nIf you want ask me any question - my skype beyondkayne69, welcome.","November 26, 2015","false","66.5"," 93 of 116 people (80%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","80","93","116","3","3"

Its fun and engaging. However, I've read that there is no VAC support for it yet, and while its pre alpha, I feel like it's a necessity for a multiplayer format.

However like all survival games the community is poor, even on PVE or RP servers, it is and will always be KoS gameplay.\n\nAfter being killed several times by a rogue player, I attempted to speak with the admins and was banned from a popular RP server.\n\n***\nA further update on the game, Considering it had an update to patch some of the clipping, lag, and finally some more Optimisation. The combat is alot smoother, though even with this advanced clipping in place, Online I still had a player 'lag' or clip through my homes wall, and suddenly kill me without my knowledge untill I was gurgling on my own blood. Needless to say, The Admins of the server seemed disinterested, and when finally seen to with some intrest, the issue was put down to 'Lag and general bugginess of the game'. Even though this game is fun, and somewhat worth its money, I cannot reccomend it, due to the amount of Hacking (Atleast what I consider it, Taking advantage of lag and bugs.) Or a game so buggy, you lose 100% Of the time in combat or sieges..\nAlot of Potential, very little progress.\n\nI become stuck making a rating of this game, especially one out of ten. I have had many hours of fun and enjoyment from this game, but it always seems to leave me with a bad, salty taste when something goes out of your control, like a hacking player or power abusing admin....\n\nWhat do you think?","November 6, 2015","false","54.3"," 115 of 150 people (77%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","77","115","150","7","9"

With nothing more than a club, few berries, torches, bandages and wearing a loincloth.\n\nYou wake up on a beach and after a nice character creation your adventure starts. You have to survive: drink, eat, find a shelter and protect yourself from other survivors that might be agressive.\n\nBut soon enough you will discover that the huge stone colosseus which is located at the end of the island is a stronghold where lies the throne of the island's king.\n\nStrong enough you can claim it and decide of a percentage of tax that will be deducted from every players gathering on the island. From 0% to 20 %.\n\nTo get the throne you have to create a guild with a banner (you can choose familly members to give access to doors and chests), build a fortress, gear and set up an army of allies ready to storm this place of power.\nYou can also slay beasts and monsters, like the corrupted humans who roam the plagued village in the center of the map where loot is abundant and powerfull.\nBuilding is easy and physic is present, to sum up it is like in Starforge where buildings are composed of blocks and needs a small set up time to be dropped. Crafting acts around upgradable automated stations. Such as the fire camp, where you can add stones to create a furnace.\nItem are commons, clubs, axes, swords, armors, lights, ect... The really funny aspect in crafting is the fact that with enough components you can build siege weapons, cells and torture tools.\n\nBecause capturing is the most appealing aspect in this game. With a rope or shackles, you can take a character and drag him into your prison. if you get caught, you can hide a stone or lockpick to give you a chance to escape. But if you can't, you may be whiped before being executed by décapitation ,hanging, ect...\n\nBut you won't be always a victim.\nThe fighting system is really nice and acts like Chivalry. First clic for attack, second for blocking, mouse scroll for 2 others attacks to cut enemie's guard.\nThe most interresting are ranged attacks, where javelins, arrows and bolts (when they hit) slows characters movements.\nWhen you shoot, if you hold right clic, you can follow the projectile, making your next shot more accurate.\n\nRoK in general is excellent and brings fresh air in a genre dominated by poor games such as Rust itself.\n\n\nSo why i don't recommand it ?\n\n\nAgain, even with a good look and content, this game lacks balance.\n\nSiege weapons.\n\nThey need work, like the explosiv barrel for the trebuchet wich has been removed.\nThe balista is usefull against blocks, but the overal feeling about siege weapons is that they are only fit for destructing blocks. If you want to set other defenses than better walls or doors... you will have to wait. You just can't kill enemy foes with this kind of weapons. Oil cauldrons, spikes or even fire would be a nice addition.\n\nClose combat.\n\nIt is still very difficult to handle some times. Mainly because blocking is very punishing especially when you have a one handed sword. That's why many players asks for shields because at the moment 2 handed weapons are overpowerfull.\nAdd to that the lack of variety in armors and the movement reduction related to it's efficiency:\nthe heavier, the slower you will be. The problem is that you can negate this reduction by using lower level boots. So if you have a steel armor, wear iron boots and you will run without any major speed reduction.\n\nResources.\nThe most important ones are iron and stone wich are located in the center of the map around a vast plain. In general if the server doesn't have rules, players build on theses spots. I'm not ranting about the way developper forced pvp but iron and stone are so rare that when few factions have claimed theses locations you have no chances to gain the upper hand especially if you consider that you can mine a collected spot by hitting the ground where the mineral spawned...\nOf course its location never changes.\n\n\nHacking.\n\nThe game has no protections against hackers. Even if you can use a password, it will destroy you player pool and is not a perfect solution because you have always somebody who speaks to the wrong person...\nHack is a real plague and should be the main issue developpers have to fix.\n\nServers and admins.\n\nMany servers are roleplaying, the problem is that guilds options are too limited and chat window is too basic to give a correct roleplay experience (even if you role play on your forums, be able to private message somebody is necessary).\nEven administration may be a problem because they can destroy everything in a matter of hours just like in Rust especially with the explosiv kegs (wich has been removed few days ago my update of this review).\nIf you played Rust imagine these admins (and hackers) can brings to rubble any buildings in 2 or 4 hours at max. So it's not loosing your stuff, it's loosing everything, especially if some players uses arrows to scout the land with the right clic ( to be simple, don't try to stay low, you will be discovered anyway due to theses stupid arrows) or goes in your guild and acts as spies to find your location (of course it is part of the gameplay but guild rights are too basic to be really protected, add to that hacking and you can imagine how quick you can loose everything when you are disconected)\n\nTO CONCLUDE:\n\nSo if you play this game be ware ! Try to find a good community where admins are not focused on being on the throne and with interresting rules (and a password !).\nTry to find structured communities instead of player slots and lack of lag.\n\nBecause you won't have any ways to progress in the game or even discover everything it has to offer.\nBecause this game is still really good and have a real potential.\n\nN.B: i will change my review as the game progresses.\nReview updated the 3/24/2015","March 17, 2015","false","40.1"," 165 of 233 people (71%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","71","165","233","13","4"

So, here's a classic steam review story! :)\n\n*REAL REVIEW BELOW\n\n~Spawned on a beach, looked around and didn't see anyone. I then discovered I had a club and decided to run around.\n\n~Stumbled upon two lads in sleeping bags.\n\n~Killed two lads in sleeping bags with said newly discovered club.\n\n~Spent about an hour running around until I finally reached the far end of the map...WAAAAAY away from the kings\n\n~Spent another 4 hours building my base. After I fortified my cabin with a few walls of logs I decided I was safe and it was time to recruite a teamate! So me and this guy met up near the castle and I lead him back to the base.\n\n~On the way he sees a guy, captures him, throws a dungeon on the ground and tells me to place it so we can capture him. Now, at this time I had no idea you could even do that and I pretty much ♥♥♥♥ myself when my new recruit put this guy in the cage and he came on the VOIP screaming for freedom and mercy. Yeah, we left him there LOL.\n\n~We FINALLY get back to the base, build his house on top of mine, build a tower right next to that and place a dungeon inside. We then gear up in iron armor and equip a few ropes.\n\n~We run waaay back to the castle to look for a couple of prisoners and what do you know! We spot a guy and as soon as he sees us he bolts up the hill towards the bridge so naturally as predators we follow him. Unfortunatly for them he leads us to his friend and we end up capturing both of them.\n\n~Long story short, me and some stranger spent about 30 minutes dragging these guys through the forest back to our base on the other side of the map with them spamming the voice keys the whole time and occasionaly demanding we kill them. Eventually one got away but we locked the other in the cage. 10/10 Would capture people again.\n\n\nREAL REVIEW!\nReign Of Kings is a medieval themed sandbox game with crafting, building, and much much more. You start as a lone peasant living in the king's land, paying the king's taxes. From here you can pretty much do anything right away, although you do start naked with only a wooden club so you might want to get started with chopping those trees.\n\nPros:~You can capture people\n~Yes...literally, you can drag them around the map by a rope and when you feel like it lock them in a cage...or kill them\n~This game has ♥♥♥♥ing guillotines and death traps to kill your prisoners in! >:)))\n~Beautiful game, great lighting and foilage. made for some great sunrises\n~Combat is good, nice and smooth. If you get your range right and kite you can win most fights.\n~Tons and tons to craft. Various building materials, upgrades, weapons, tools, etc\n~Weapon choice is decent, both meele weapons and projectiles are in the game\n~Plenty of wild life! Finally! A game that got it right! So far every time I've went out to hunt...guess what? I've hunted. To many survival games cant balance that, you either run out or its too easy.\n\nCons:~Trees are a bit glitchy because sometimes they fly away but hey, its ealy access. Actually, for an EA game this is one of the most polished.\n~My prisoner escaped is rope! D: how!? he wasted all his rope escape things! :'(\n~None.\n\nGET THIS GAME NOW!!!!","March 13, 2015","true","41.4"," 114 of 157 people (73%) found this review helpful 58 people found this review funny","73","114","157","58","1"

After promising claims made by the developer. The game was all fun and games until hackers and exploiters came along , the developer did not handle this problem at all and instead just let it slide off the desk while they lie about "improving the ban system" in each update as hackers and exploiters were increasing and not decreasing. I wasn't really bothered about that either.\n\nBut after an incident which changed my view of the game completely" , I stopped being a "fan" of this game.So heres what happened , I did what I normally did , joined an official server , killed more than 20 players , 8 of them got sour and claimed I was hacking so they all reported me since I pawned them at their game. The so called "staff" of the game didn't even check if I was hacking and just banned me from the server thinking that I was hacking cause I was savaging them like a beast. I honestly though that they would improve the system whereas they are actually just banning all players who get higher reports than average . This showed how unfair the system was and for the first time I was angry at the game.It was also first time after hundred's of hours playing the game that I was banned for "Exploit" when I didnt even exploit anything.\n\nOverall , the developer said they were improving the ban system on exploiters and hackers , but honestly theres still tons of exploiters/hackers out there and they just simply ban people. Worst developer/staff I've seen in my entire life.\n\nDefinitely would not recommend anyone buying this game thats in this current state , its a rip off so better left untouched and save your $15 . I doubt this game would ever be fixed as the developers I found out was the one who made Starforge which had the same issue.\n\n3/10","February 29","false","725.8"," 54 of 63 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","54","63","0","15"

I really enjoyed it, so why dont i reccomend it you ask? Simply that the devs are not skilled devs. Lets go over some actual game stuff:\n\nBUILDING: The building system uses blocks, it has tiers, alot of people complain that by the time they log on their base is gone. I have never actually been raided on this game because i stayed away from all the good areas and my base was hidden. I understand the frustration with the map balancing because if you want to be safe you are 10 minute walk away from any resources ( Plus time for when you lag.) To be honest the only time you would be truly safe is if you have the highest tier walls and a few layers (Which takes hours and hours to build if your not a massive clan, so long that its not worth it before the next wipe.)\n\nCOMBAT: The game follows chivalry warfare combat style however thats not really the case. Its often laggy and you know how that will end if you crash in a fight. To be fair i like the bow but they really haven't improved combat mechanics itself. They just added some new weapons (basically sword but different model) and took them a whole month to finish the work on shields.\n\nRAIDING:  Raids are fun sometimes, the thrill of trebbing someones base is awesome :) However people mostly just raid offline so not really fun if your not active.\n\nRoleplay: I play on roleplay servers, its the only good thing about this server, its a good game for rp with the whole king system. One annoyance about the king is you get those really o.p clans that hold the throne and charge 20% tax. On official servers people just build skybridges to take your throne.\n\nOverall: It WAS a good game with potential, if you like it near enough as it is now buy it. But this game is going no where. You only have to look at starforge to realise these devs are unfaithful.","August 29, 2015","false","156.6"," 71 of 93 people (76%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","76","71","93","4","8"

It is so fun and creative and is the first game that has addicted me in over a year and this is why It hurts to not recommend it but I cannot recommend this game to anyone.\n\nThe reason I give this game a thumbs down is its community. Never before have I seen such a vile cesspool of offensive, homophobic twelve year olds. Some guy in full armor attacks you when you have nothing? dont worry, he will tell you how sh--it you are at the game after he killed you! Guy attacks you and he fails and dies? you are now a "fa-g--got" and a "hacker" For example, today I had a fight with a guild of 5 while I was by myself, the reason we had a fight was they caused me to lose some land I claimed. I hung one, killed 3 with an axe and 1 ran away injured. I was then verbally abused over chat by being notified that I am a "fa-g---got piece of sh---it" and then I got accused of spawning them items and that I hacked the items in for them, they wanted me to be reported.\n\nI also witness a lot of discrimination on this game, while building my own house I saw the chat fill up multiple time with racial slurs and people being called cu--nts all because someone died. Its terrible.\n\nAnother reason to not buy this is the hackers. With no anti cheat or server admins hackers can go about freely on what they do oh and trust me, they do. Want to be king? nope, hacker will slay you as soon as you are crowned. Built a good base? hacker can delete blocks! Having a fair fight? nope, expect a speed hack, 1hit kill hack and god mode! I also witnessed a hacker block the entrance to the throne today so no more kings in that server till restart. Oh and also, considering there are 30 player slots per server, expect at least 4 of them players to be hackers.\n\nAnd finally, its all fun doing all this grinding to build an amazing house and collecting all items but at this current stage, its pointless. When watching the trailer I imagined a game with a few large guilds with a nice big village/fort/castle but no. Guilds consist of maybe 2-3 people because you cant trust anyone and there are multiple guilds. You will never feel safe enough to leave your house because it will get looted. No ones neutral, there is no politics or alliance. Everyone just wants to steal. This is a waste of time, yesterday I spent 10 hours grinding, I built a small 2 story house deep in the woods, I was a neutral player, I appeased the big guilds to keep them happy and only captured and executed players I saw murdering noobs. So you can imagine my dispair as I saw the guild of 8 members roll up with what I can describe as the most overpowered Trebuchet ever and knock my 10 hour development down in less than 5 minutes for no reason but just because they can.\n\nEDIT: *Today I joined an RP-PvP whitelist server, basically you had to be allowed into the server and there are rules as to what you can and cannot do, I am now loving the game as I have found a good community and server to play on*\n\nWhitelisted server with rules\n\n9/10\n\nFun game\nGood rules\nNo hackers\nGood players\n\nOffical server/community server without rules or whitelist\n\n6/10\n\nFun game\nBad community\nHackers\nEnd result is not all that\n\nWait like 6 months till hackers are more rare and price goes up so kids cannot buy.","April 6, 2015","false","188.5"," 145 of 212 people (68%) found this review helpful 25 people found this review funny","68","145","212","25","15"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thedrastikmeasure/recommended/344760/","thedrastikmeasure","Draul","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thedrastikmeasure/","3252 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nReign of Kings is an action adventure sandbox survival game developed by CodeHatch. We all know of CodeHatch from their past blunder that is known as StarForge. Broken promises and missed opportunities galore with StarForge. Took forever in early access, didn’t make real on half their promises and lets be honest. Their kickstart was a scam. That is highly unfortunate for anyone who backed them. Their game had a ton of potential but it fell hard on it’s face and left a lot of gamers, customers… Very, very, very… Unhappy.\n\n\n\nSo now we have Reign of Kings. Another early access title by CodeHatch. Should you be careful with your purchase? Absolutely. Since the start of their original Kickstarter for StarForge there has been a slew of survival game releases. So now they have an example to follow. Sure it seems fishy they put this title into early access the same time as Medieval Engineers by Keen House hits, but the two games aren’t really aimed to be all that similar. So lets go to it.\n\nThe main focus of Reign of Kings is to survive. To do so you must harvest materials such as hay, flax, wood, sticks, iron, stone, food, water, and other materials. At the core of the game is the crafting system as this is needed really to do anything. The goal is to survive. As most survival games you need to find food and water. We have to eat and drink right? That is after all a trope of all survival. Makes sense we find it in this game.  However look at most survival games crafting is a second hand thing. There is world loot in those games. Not in Reign of Kings. It is all about the crafting. Which really brings the game down in my opinion. I feel the game could benefit from having random generated world and having one or even two “kingdoms”. Having two castles. The two kingdoms could go to war. Then also have the whole civil war within.  The fact that there is one designed map with next to no points of interest aside from the castle and a “ghost town” really kills it for me. I don’t get a good sense of immersion because everything is player built. Honestly… I would just stick to Rust if I knew this was the case.\n\nThere is one really cool system to the game though. That is the King system for all intensive purposes. A player can sit on the throne and become the king. If there is already a king the king can be killed. To become king you can go to the castle and sit on the throne. Now there is player structures so a good solid group can fortify the castle pretty well. The design for the castle/island is fairly cool however It would be much more entertaining if the castle weren’t a citadel/throne room and was a tad more customizable. The person who becomes king can rename the kingdom and can also set taxes. I am not to sure what the cap on taxes is but it stands to reasoning if you want to stay king set the taxes high so that the other citizens are starved. It works even better if your community is willing to roleplay.  Still this is the one feature of the game that stands out above the other survival games.\n\n\n\nThe combat is similar to Chivalry, but it is the weakest point of the game at this point. Perhaps I am not a hardcore player in this sense but it feels clunky, it is very glitchy, and I have not played a survival game with worse combat. The one cool think that is combat related is the ability to capture a person with a rope and drag them around. You can also put them into catches hang them from the gallows, put them in stocks, or chop their heads off with guillotines. There are also siege weapons which will be a ton of fun. The overall look of the building blocks is dull and boring at this point and everything is very blocky in terms of player building. I would love to see some refinement as the game goes through it’s stages in early access and more so a option to add in crosshairs for combat.\n\n\n\nThe character creation is pretty fantastic and you can build all sorts of crazy looking characters. However at this point there are no female characters and… The hair of the characters is about three generations behind in terms of appearence. The game is visually very appealing but the faces and the hair breaks all sorts of barriers and the graphics become extremely inconsistent in that term.\n\nAs time goes on we will see a lot more survival games. Each that have a unique appeal to it. Reign of Kings does indeed have a few things that set itself apart however If your on the mend of a broken heart, or wallet from CodeHatch’s last title. I suggest you wait for development.\n\nI got to play on Gaming-Asylum’s Roleplay server for Reign of Kings and it made my poor experiences from other servers way more entertaining. If you don’t know of Gaming-Asylum they have several Arma 3 RP Life servers and recently had a successful kickstarter for their upcoming game Identity. They know roleplay and have a great community (for the most part.) Check out their Roleplay server by clicking Community and the server browser and search for Asylum.\n\nhttp://thedrastikmeasure.com/2015/03/14/reign-of-kings-pc-preview/","March 14, 2015","false","19.7"," 444 of 694 people (64%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","64","444","694","17","34"

The actual gameplay is very boring, you spend hours just farming resources and farming and farming, and when you finally have a base made, it can be stolen from you very easily. Destroying someone's base is way too easy as time.\n\nMy time spent on this game was entirely wasted, as was my money. Maybe if the community wasn't trash, but most players just run around trying to kill others and take their things. Garbage game and garbage people who play it.\n\nEdit1:\nI gave this game another chance the other day, spent hours making a base only to have a few people exploit the fact that they could jump on each other to get over my walls. It takes hours to make a base that is not only big enough to protect all of your equipment, but also tall enough to actually defend against stupid exploits like this.\nTHIS GAME IS AWFUL, DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON IT\n\nEdit2:\nThis game is however incredibly addictive, I find myself coming back to it regardless of how frustrated it made me, so many times.\n\nEdit3: Seriously though, this game is rampant with hackers and a very awful community. Also the servers seem to be weird because foreign people appear very often.\nI made a glorious base after returning to this game for.. I don't know how many times, and then left for a minute to collect resource, and my base was captured while I was gone. The people there managed to kill me in a single hit.

I want to reccomend this game so badly but i cannot.\n\nThe community for the game is actually really cool if you aren't a complete spud. I made heaps of new friends playing. To bad everyone ive ever played with has left. Every new patch they ask, "Hey man whats new in RoK worth playing again?" and i remember back to the very first week and theres literally no difference.\n\nEvery new patch they add a bunch of useless stuff. They add things like instruments, masks and flower outfits. For 2 seconds its HAHA LOL FUNNY OMG ROFL. Then its old. I think they added them for role play and diversity. But everyone just wears steel armour and carries steel greatswords. Theres no diversity. It boils down to:\n\nWhy should i make a mask and wear it if it just means ill get 1 hit in the head. I should just wear steel helmet for best protection. Why should i fill my base with furiniture, when im going to get raided or hacked anyway. I should just invest in more blocks. There are only 3 items that have been added that i regularly see people use. The tabard, crossbow and shield.\n\nThe devs seem to create bugs/exploits everytime they try to fix an old one. Heres a great example: If you use to log out in a small area, you could spawn back stuck in the floor. So their solution was to say: " If you spawn in an area too small, your character is placed back on the spawn beach". Well, i just trapped guys in my house because they were raiding me. So what do they do? log off in the corner. When they log back in they spawned free on the beach with all my loot............... It just seems like an endless cycle of bug fixing and raid balancing without any worthwhile content.\n\nThe devs have implemented some ideas from the community, but there are so many better suggestions that they ignore:\n2 kings which tax half the land each. Pre designed wall structures and buildings which save on resources and get a proper castles going faster. Farms. USEFUL outfits with unique perks. Bones, fangs, feathers should be able to be added to armour for diversity. Instead, they made a boring new map which promotes hoarding and offline raiding.\n\nOffline raiding is why i stopped playing. 15 minute raid destroys a whole week of constant work.  Is it that hard to implement something like: "If no players from guild have been on for 30 minutes, then all structure health within your crest is trippled"?\n\nOnce you have base and armour the only thing left to do is raid. There is no places to visit, quests to do or high level gear to strive to.\n\nI do like the combat. It's like chivalry but without the ridiculous spinning 360 backwards crouching overhead headshots. That being said, combat goes to ♥♥♥♥♥ when there is more than 2 people fighting. Lag and ping take over.\n\nTLDR - "I could've been a contender.

And took a break due to it's bugs until recently. Me and my friends picked the game up again, since there where promising news. We joined a large player group and started playing on a server.\n\nFirst the good. This game has good graphics in general. If you slam up those sliders many areas of the map look great. The combat has a learning curve and the recent update added some nice features, if you kick a blocking person with a shield for example, you can now break his block and hit him afterwards.\nThe building is in my opinion the greatest part of the game. You can build your own castle and roam through your halls. They have drawbridges, furniture and many building items supporting your creativity to the fullest.\nI spend hours and hours placing blocks and items, thinking about how i would raid my base and how to prevent this. Awesome stuff I tell you.\n\nWhich leads me to the next part, the raids. Raiding is more difficult and way more expensive then in the early days, making it even more rewarding if you succeed. There is nothing like standing on a freshly raided castle and taking their loot, since the raiding is a core and essential part of the game. On the other hand there is nothing worse then your base being gone the next day you log in. But this is the game this is what you singed up for. Don't complain try again and make it safer next time. They now have these things called totems which can protect your base from being removed completely.\n\nI know this is early access, but since this game is on sale more people should know what they are buying. This game has bugs. You can avoid many of them and many have been fixed in the past. Another thing is the engine. With my gtx 770 I get 60 fps if I don't run the game on "ultra" settings. The game is pretty but not very well optimized. If you walk towards a huge base you get massive frame drops, leaving you with 1-5 fps sometimes. I doubt they will improve this by a lot in the beta.\n\nThe servers lag a lot. It's great that this game is growing more popular since it leads to full servers. And I have no problem waiting in a queue and to wait until I can play with my mates. The issue I am having is the lag. A full 40 people server is awful. There is no other word to describe it. The nice combat suddenly feels like a stop motion movie and is not decided by skill anymore.\n\nHowever all these stated things won't keep me from playing the game. The biggest issue are the hackers. We had 3 on our server just yesterday, raiding our chests without any effort. And this was not the first time this happened. This game has little to none cheat protection. And the game being on sale made it just worse.\n\nI really hope they improve this protection in some sort, until then I'd rather recommend to stay away from this game. So you can join the game once it is in a decent state leading to a great experience for everyone.\n","October 26, 2015","false","138.8"," 55 of 72 people (76%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","76","55","72","4","1"

There is no survival, sure you have to eat and drink but theres food and drink aplenty, so no challenge there.\nThen youre left with building. It is fun, as all other similar games are. But it quickly loses any form of interest and becomes a huge, tedious grind for resources. Especially if your King sets high taxes. If you want to build a castle of more epic proportions be ready to grind an insane amount of trees and stone.\nAnd then comes the question, to what end?  you build a castle and siege weaponry and hang some useless baubles in your newly fetched stone home.... and then go out kill your neighbour?\n\nIm very curious what the devs are intending to accomplish with this game. As it is now, theres no point. After having built your castle, formed a guild and taken control of the island with your clan, there is nothing to do. Why would i want to log back in? I cant be arsed to build anything else (which is the main feature of the game), Being King is not really rewarding in any way (oo i got the best sword and i can get taxes).\nIt really is all a matter of endgame. This piece of work has none. Since there is absolutely no survival element and that building requires you to grind endless amounts of materials (unlike minecraft), you get stuck with fighting other players. And the fighting mechanics are, to say the least, not the best around.\n\nSo unless the devteam (which is credited for a similar game which has dramatic reviews for not finishing their product) comes up with something great to lead this project towards sense. I fear this one is going to get stuck in the limbo.\n\nIm gonna put thumbs down for now, because i cant recommend buying it at this point, ill come back in 6 months to see what has happened and where this is going.","May 30, 2015","false","24.7"," 77 of 109 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","77","109","2","4"

They fix none of the major issues and act like everything is fine. The fact a server becomes unplayable after 30 minutes after restart for a close range combat system completely cripples the gameplay and makes 50% of users on a server log out till restart is insane. Codehatch failed again and they expect new people to pay for it, I think the company should be sued and quartered till no one is left working for them because they're completely clueless and peddle nothing but games that the best computers on Earth could never run. Ignore everything else and heed my word because no one will be as honest and forward as me. I put almost 700 hours in this game while it was Alpha/Beta and the same issues have never been addressed and they could careless. Buy Rust or another game that will actually be improved.

I caved, because I wanted a medieval rust to play. Amazingly the game actually doesn't seem that bad for early access, not very laggy, the fighting can be a bit wonky but is playable, and the building is enjoyable.\n\nHowever, less than an hour into the game I requested a refund and returned the game. My reason for this is simple, if I want to be killed before being able to accomplish anything, I already own two games that give me that experience, Rust and Ark. The player count is dropping, those left have nothing to do but kill anything that is not in their guild giving fresh spawns very little chance to build up. Updates are slowing down, and being one of the unlucky people who bought into Starforge, it looks like the writing is on the wall to follow the previous titles path towards the sewers.\n\nA real shame, because all I want in the gaming world is a medieval rust with a focus on making survival an actual challenge, rather than a small micro task for your first hour. I recommend you stay away from the game due to the nature of the devs history, nature of the community in these kind of games, and the current gameplay options. However, if you are like me and just really need a medieval rust experience, keep a stopwatch going so you don't miss your refund window.","July 20, 2015","false","0.8"," 43 of 57 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","43","57","2","0"

I have great internet, I have a great computer. I am not here to complain about FPS I have silky buttersmooth FPS. From here on I will go by bullet points on whats good and bad about this game.\n\n\n|||BAD|||\n*The Nedcode- Its early access blah blah blah I get it, but when I literally can't hit a player who is standing still there is an issue when the game is a strictly multiplayer game that relies on that, thats something that should be at least halfway decent when a game like this is released.\n*The Servers- Community servers are laggy its to be expected, that being said the official ones are either just as bad or laggier, This paired with the netcode issues is a complete nightmare.\n*Game Breaking bugs- Just an example in version 3 you would die before even getting into the server and get stuck in limbo making you relog or go find a new server as there isn't a "Respawn" button for whatever reason.. Anyway that bug was fixed in Version  4 right? No or well kinda, now the bug has evolved to where you now control 2 bodies constantly, you can even switch the POV with C toggling cameras between the bodies XD. Anyway this is early access and early alpha im not complaining toooo much I know what I was getting into.\n*The Castle Bridge or Sword or whatever- Building on this is toooo OP, I understand the creator wants you to make raid weapons but FFS I was on a server where one guy got on when no one else was and built a wall and encased himself just to troll, this needs to have a fix.\n____\n\n\\\GOOD///\n*The Crafting- I love it, I don't know what else to say, the crafting is one of my favorite aspects of this game.\n*The World- I like how it looks definetly, its also just the right size. I honestly can't even think of something I could critisize about it, its perfect at what it is for.\n*Updates- Game released a few days ago and has had 4 updates, definitely something I can praise.\n*Tons of things to do- Kidnapping people, being a hermit, being a king, do whatever you want!\n**Potential- I see myself addicted if what I stated above is fixed, I really do.. Day 1 it was great and now its a hell literally. It's very sad. Anyway this game has potential to be the game people refer too when talking of a game in this genre, beating out its main opponent 'Rust'\n\nTL;DR- 10/10 potential, fix the game and my real rating would be a 9/10. As it is now I do not recommend, wait until the game is fixed.","March 15, 2015","false","4.1"," 180 of 289 people (62%) found this review helpful 56 people found this review funny","62","180","289","56","2"

However, in it's current state there are many bugs which can ruin your gaming experience. For instance people can become invisible when you close a door on them. Doors can also appear as open/closed when they are in the other state, so you can lose all your items. I suggest not having any doors.\n\nThey are constantly fixing these types of exploits though, the ability to steal items through walls has apparently been fixed this patch.\n\n\nThe lack of optimization at the moment is also kind of crappy, BUT this appears to be there main concern at the moment so we will have to see how that goes.\n\nCould be amazing but in its current state I could not recommend it to anyone simply because it is not in a finished state and could remain this way (broken) indefinitely.\n\nHowever, if you are not bothered about the price it is a great addition to your gaming collection.\n\n\n\nKill the TYRANT KING!","March 16, 2015","false","99.2"," 100 of 154 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","100","154","0","0"

There should be a punishment system for developers who take too much time to release a game, like paying back people who bought the game, at least 25% of what they paid.\n\nNow on to Reign of Kings.\n\nThis game is pretty much a rip off of Rust.  Same crafting mechanics, I mean, identical.\n\nGame is pretty much unplayable.  Every now and then, you get this weird fart/puke sound (I think it's the sound you make when you die) then you freeze, you can't move.  Then you press F, which makes you flex?  I don't know.  Then you can move again (yes, really) but you can't change weapon/access inventory.\n\nNow I understand that it's not supposed to be 100% playable BUT shame on you for releasing a game that requires us to relog every 5 minutes to clear whatever bug makes the game so broken you can't even play long enough to enjoy.  Alphas, at least on steam, should be at least stable and playable because if the goal is only to test, know that there are companies out there who actually pay people to test their games, not the other way around, what's the point?\n\nSo right now this game is not worth 20$ only because it's heavily flawed and people shouldn't pay to test a game, they should only pay to play.  Steam should force developpers to make sure their game is stable enough before they allow it to go live.\n\nOn the good side, once this game is fixed, I can see lots of fun.  Rust was fun right up until hackers started to show up and make it unplayable.\n\nRight now, this game is not worth it, don't buy it.  Wait for them to fix 90% of what's available right now before you get it.","March 14, 2015","false","20.6"," 215 of 349 people (62%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","62","215","349","13","7"

I've got alot of hours in and met some awesome people on a no KoS server but the game has far to many trolls that just want to destroy your crest and deconstruct your home.\nI got permabanned for putting an admins friend into my pillory and he started ♥♥♥♥♥ing.\n\nEvery one raids when you're asleep,at work or at school and theres NOTHING you can do about it you can triple layer your walls but a trebuchet is so broken no block matters.\n\nEvery one thinks they are really good (lol.)\n\nThey failed to add a working ban system you can literally do one thing to instantly get unbanned from every server ( not gonna say how.)\n\nHackers have increased ten fold with incredibly disturbing hacks such as teleport,item spawning, godmode, one hit kill, noclip & invisibility theres probably more but those are the few I saw.\n\nEdit: So they fixed it so you can longer use a pirated copy and play online YES THAT WAS POSSIBLE. review remains the same.\n\nI do enjoy the combat the reason being is that its simple ANYONE could do it as long as no one finds exploits on how to kill some one quickly or they change the combat to chivalry I think it'll be good.\n\nEdit #2: So I haven't played recently and probably won't especially from what I hear on how the hackers have gotten even worse...if you truly wish to know how bad ill tell you that a source code has been released that allows hackers TO ACCESS ADMIN COMMANDS obviously not all admin commands are usable but some primarily a "Give all" command that allows the admin to give himself EVERYTHING in the game + 1k of it even the ability to spawn NPC's.\n\nHackers can teleport people into the sky and cage them thats apparently a thing now and have ACCESS TO WIPE INVENTORIES? WTF? isn't that serverside? damn.\nGameplay I'm sure is still the same, work hard & spend hours only for a hacker to come on and you guessed it. or you go to sleep after spending maybe 12 hours with a friend grinding and building a glorious base to wake up dead & your base no longer being there (they destroy your crest and place their own which gives access to pick up the blocks you placed down.)\n\nCharacters are still trolly and abused alot of people make the dumbest character which surprisingly abuses the hitbox from what I'm aware small people are harder to hit but have a smaller weapon reach however small people with large arms MAY have long reach? honestly I don't see why this effects the hitbox...so if this tells you anything it means people are going to abuse every game mechanic possible to win.\n\nBE WARNED THE ONLY SAFE HAVENS ARE HIGHLY CONTROLLED COMMUNITIES GOVERNED BY A LARGE QUANTITY OF ADMINS MAINLY THE ONES THAT DEDICATE 100% OF THEIR TIME TO BEING ON. (I've only seen this on an RP server which I'm very interested in to see how it works.)\n\n(more edits coming otherwise its still a fun game just filled with douches,cheaters & poor netcode.)","March 16, 2015","false","71.9"," 79 of 120 people (66%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","66","79","120","0","9"

This is great for a Team Fortress Server where you invest 30 mins in a match rinse and repeat. For a sandbox MMO this is scary as hell. Examples.\n1. They dont pay the bill. Wipe.\n2. They have 15 beers and just decide to run around gozilla style and destory crap.\n3. Thier son that is 8 goes on a rampage.\n* the point here being there is a lot of time and effort to build your castle. Hell I spent 5 hours yesterday getting my small house set up 12 x 12 x 4 entry hall with 2 doors to slow down someone going through doors. I slept for 5 hours and woke up to 6 blocks missing from a wall in a spot I can tell did not get beat now manual. I have no clue how they destroyed my wall but they cleaned out my 30 items i had stored including a starter club, ax, pickaxe. Guessing since they didnt take the easy way in... The 1500 hp door but instead descroy 21000 hps of wall that they used seige or hacked. Not sure. I digress from the point.\n** I see no point in playing this game unless you buy a server and run it because otherwise you will eventually lose everything when the owner gets bored. I recommend going in with 2 friends and play 10 dollars each and get a 40 person server and find a few people you trust from other games to pitch in for admin.\n*** Do Not Even do that until there is a sure way to ban people and keep them banned.\n\nPros:\n1. FUN\n- Minecraft style building blocks for housing lots of cool stuff to make.\n- Fun combat when not roped and drug all over the place and dealing with speed/invis hackers\n2. Beautiful.\n- I like the world itself the art is good. (with the exception of char design which is blah but funny)\n3. built in voice\n4. Very hostile game. 3/4 people that find you are going to try and kill you.\nCon:\n1. Private servers (every 30 days you wonder if the lights are going out).\n- I'd rather the game designer rent the servers through a hoster so if one is abandonned someone can pick it up.\n- You'll really need to spend some time trying to find good/honest admins before you move into a server.\n2. Too many hackers/cheating admins\n3. built in voice\n4. They have a lot of work to do to beat the hackers. **example** no real way to keep people banned.\n5. Very hostile game. 3/ people that find you.... this is a huge issue when you spawn and get killed over and over before you can homestead and figure out the map at all.\n\nIt all boils down to, IMO, you cant do a sandbox MMO with private own servers/admin. SWGEMU is about the best of that lot that i've seen so far, and anyone that has spent any time on those servers can see how the admin even of the best servers ocationally go off on rampages. With the much smaller investment of 20 to 70 bucks a month the server owner abuses will just be out of control on most servers. And even when they dont abuse very few servers will have the admin support to keep hackers out of you home at 3 am. The current Gen of gammer will eat this game up. Spend 20 dollars once, go to a server hack and steal  a week of someones walls and build a fortress in hours. If you get banned (even if they make it stick) move on to NA E C34 and do it there until you get banned. They have no investment in money or time so what is it to them that they screw up some poor players month of work.","April 4, 2015","false","387.4"," 105 of 167 people (63%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","63","105","167","16","7"

I would 100% recommend this game to anyone if one thing was fixed.\n\nImagine this:\nYou and your friends are excited to build an amazing structured, thorough and defensive base. You spend all week gathering materials, armour and food to survive and strive with. You begin building the base. You structure it carefully to make sure that it is reinforced well, so that no pesky raiders can get in.\n\noh no, that's in an ideal world. i forgot the part about where when you log off overnight your base is no more.\n\nThe main flaw of this game is logging off. If you want to play with friends, it's useless. Your base will be gone as soon as you are, your items, everything - gone. I can't say it's the players fault, because for many servers, the concept is to capture and overpower others - but ask yourself this, is it really fair that, in a map so small, as soon as you log off, anybody can target you because YOU and your BASE will remain.\n\nOh also, imagine walking down a path, charging your bow, firing then being launched into the air and dying with over 5K stone, Iron etc.\n\nThat has happened twice now.\n\n\nThere needs to be something implemented to fix this, this game may then have better reviews and provide a better experience for the constantly dying community.\n\ntl;dr - this game has everything ready and waiting, it's like they have everything but don't no how to put it together. No real execution.\n\nI feel really bad for writing a negative review about this, but really, I can't have much fun in a repeating cycle of grind, make base, die, base gone, repeat.\n\nNow for my Positives and Negatives.\n\nPros -\nNo russians\nDecent / Good graphics\nA good game concept.\nProvides a simplistic but realistic medieval concept.\nGood game mechanics\nLots of servers and different styles.\nConstant updates and item additions.\n\nCons-\nYour base will be gone if you leave.\nMap could be extended a little.\nYou die so fast from thirst / hunger.\nLots of 'bloodthirsty' people.\n\nNotice, my pros are in a larger quantity than the cons but that is not the point; the point is that there needs to be some fixes to this game before it can be a 'real' game.\n\nFun to play, but overall I would recommend this game but not yet, do not buy yet, wait until further updates to fix some of these quite important problems.\n\nReign of Kings, I give you -\n6.5/10\n","August 13, 2015","false","18.6"," 37 of 50 people (74%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","74","37","50","2","4"

I purchased it when it was in early access and the game still just isn't finished. Laggy combat is one of the worst of any game I have played. I was hoping for Chivarly-style combat and it fell far short.\n\nPostive:\nCrafting system is nice. Graphics are pretty nice even with low-level settings. Concept is unique and fun.\n\nNegative:\nServer Lag - Players teleport around while in combat. Bows are useless due to this. Combat is pure luck if you can hit someone. Mostly consists of getting the longest sword/axe you can and just swing until you hopefully catch them as they lag around. Tried many different servers. Latency to various servers was great, there is just some issue with how the game is designed. Servers have to perform frequent reboots due to other problems with the game running for more than a few hours.\n","May 1","false","28.7"," 30 of 38 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","30","38","2","1"

The combat only works if you're not lagging so if you live in the US don't expect to be able to fight very well considering there are only 1-2 populated American servers that are on Stormwall. Stormwall as of Alpha 17 gives consistent crashes after about 30-40 minutes of gameplay and in general runs very badly. You can expect to get around 30 fps on a populated server, unless the map's been wiped recently.\n\nIf you go into the game wanting to be friendly with others or just meet new people you will most likely be either captured if you're naked or killed for your gear. You will do well to avoid capture because you will probably be thrown in stocks or a cage until you die of dehydration/hunger. I found the only way to really experience the whole of the game was to play on either a whitelisted or just an RP server. On RP servers you will usually be able to meet people without them wrecking you or sometimes even join a guild and conquer other castles or the throne.\n\nThe game's premise and features to have a fun medieval building/warfare experience are all there but sadly the playerbase doesn't let the game live up to what it could have been. The majority of players are greedy and paranoid. If you approach someone else on the official servers there's about a 1/5 chance they will want to talk to you or not attack. Nakeds like in Rust are very dangerous and are only really worth approaching if they are alone. If they get even the slightest semblance of being able to defeat you they will engage in combat. Even if you think the naked is friendly do not let him follow you, he will strike when you are vulnerable. Also kill any girl gamer on sight they usually will do the same except they will have a legion of betamale fart sniffers to back them up.\n\nAll in all the game is decent but like I said earlier, overpriced in my opinion.

If you truly like to aid or be part of the development process then this game might be for you.\n\nThe idea of this game is great, but nothing is balanced. There is no sense in building a base because it will get destroyed. If you build a granary you are a fool if you think it will last. All the cool equipment you can build,  water wells, granarys, soon to be saw mills, are just pointless at the current state. You build what you feel is an impenetrable fortress, go to bed, get on, and it is gone. For awhile that was part of the fun... trying to build something that is not destroyed in 24 hours. My friends and I would grind a day out building a base and then boom its gone. Of course we want to be able to destroy bases but the seige weapons are OP at the moment. If you do build a base you better build it floating in the sky, but come on, this is not an anti gravity planet as far as I can tell. Because of the pointlessness of gathering resources, it promotes you to just go kill people and take their resources and their bases which can be fun, but really kills the ability to achieve anything great and put on any epic battles.\n\nFighting can be fun but once you get all that cool armor you will likely just get raided and have everything stolen in 24 hours or attacked by a group of naked people throwing javelins which is pretty funny at first. If this would be your primary interest then this game is for you. If you are wanting to build an awesome self sustaining compound where you can suit up with your friends in epic armor fighting epic battles... well its not going to happen. Also, there are frquent server wipes where all your work is wiped clean, but that is part of development so I can understand that.  On the other end of the spectrum you have the non fighting RP servers. They are great if that is your thing, but there is just no good middle ground.  It's trolls or carebares.\n\nThis game is fun for all the crazy little experiences that happen, but once you realize that it is grossly unbalanced, and its just an endless grind with no real payout, it begins to lose its luster. With this said I am excited see this game develop and I am going to revisit in a month or two to see how its evolved.

Quick solution.. add nameplates (in the real world you would easily spot someone by the looks, but in this world everyone looks the same so add nameplates...)\n\n- Server performance issues after being up a while which is causing major lagg in e.g. chat, voip, crafting, etc...\n\n- The characters need a rework in animation and mesh. They look and feel bad unfortunatly.\n\n- The melee blocking system needs to be improved both in radius of blocking and animation.\n\n\nFor now i don't recommend this game.

It hasn't, and apparently many who played the game for way longer than I have would agree. What a shame, really, this game actually had something going for it.\n\nWell played ChodeHatch, can't wait to see what you all will fart out next.\n\nUpdated: 11/9/2015\nReign of Kings is estimated to release early this Decemeber.\n\nUpdates since ALPHA 1 can be found at the following link:\nhttp://reignofkings.gamepedia.com/Changelog#RoK_Update_.28Alpha_2.29\n\nLots and lots has been added, but alas people don't like the game. There's a reason for everything, or there's no reason at all but large groups of people don't just form opinions out of thin air. Many scores of players have come and gone through the game and yet it has a negative reputation. Perhaps something is wrong with the Steam Review system, maybe more recent reviews should hold higher value than older ones. Or that is a fools dream and all things should be taken into account.\nThe game itself has always been decent enough to warrent people wanting it to develop INTO something fantastic. Honestly the first time I played it was allot of fun, as I said, I played with a few friends. Seriously, Infestation: Survival Story is fun with a few friends, so that doesn't mean much. Fact is, if you enjoy a structure based voxel game, with a faction based system that relies on your interaction with other players in a knightly setting, than yes you will very much like Reign of Kings. Harvesting, crafting, building and surviving are all part of your experience as well as the chance to take the crown and taxes the plebians. Or maybe you wanna be someone elses pleb, or maybe you just want to be a higher tier pleb on the totem pole so you can control or kill other plebs. At it's core, Reign of Kings has a love hate relationship built right into the gameplay. A player can become king and own the entire land. Players can form together and fight against the evil king or serve under some good king. As always the line of good and evil is never drawn very straight so take it for what the example is worth.\n\nWhich comes to what I call the stinky finger of the concept. This is a game that looks really good on the drawing board, and really really well when actually executed in a controlled enviroment. But when you yourself are actually on the playing field....it wafts.\nBad jokes aside, on a decent server with active players that ARE NOT IN A CONTROLLED COMMUNITY you are more than likely to get clubbed to death in the first hour. Say you survive, build up a nice shanty in the woods, all you and your gnomish buddies huddle up in the corner, with the wee lil crest of protection to keep 'realism' from creeping through the front door. But do lul and behold for people found ways around that pretty quickly. In ways the game wants you to be there actively playing it for hours on end a day, no no no, I retract that, it NEEDS you to be there.\n'Why is that a bad thing, if I'm playing a game actively shouldn't it be the only game I'm playing?' Cause life doesn't work that way for everyone. That doesn't make it a game killing choice of design but it does put off allot of people who would REALLY enjoy the genre. Nothing brings hordes of people faster to a party than a medieval theme right? Hence why at Alpha 1 release it got such a large following at the gates. But problems develop over time for these cycles. People lose interest, be it getting kicks elsewhere or just getting fed up with the game. More than likely that initial wave of interest had people getting their friends into it left and right. Now the recent discussions on the forums seem to boil down to several communites and a terrible list of official servers. As I said, they tried to fix things and I can only guess it didn't work out. My playtest of the alpha consists of the first few builds so I personally cannot say what and where it went wrong within the games meta development. I'm just here to tell you what I'm seeing as of today.\nThere is mumbles of a really good modding community for RoK but here we are, taking the limelight away from the stars of the show.\nWhat seems to be a consistent factor with the developer CodeHatch is the disconnection they have with the community. I understand why this is, as the very name of the developer brings the stagnant memory of the previous early access ship they had set sail. Namely StarForge, a game that also has a negative wrap but hardy fans who still would throwndown with you over if it's a 'good' game or not are also present. But from an observers stand point, the community talks and talks and talks to people and their dog about the game but you don't hear so much from the devs. Which seems to be pushing what little is left away. Sadly you get this pushy feeling too with some people from the community as there is always a more 'hardcore' crowd that may be less than friendly to new faces.\nSo at the end of the day, do I recommend you get this game? Of course not, but I never counted the game out of my zone and in a few ways I still don't. As I mentioned, it's got a final release coming up so I will end up giving that a shot. I'll do a much more serious RoK review video and hey I hope then I can change this to a recommend.","October 23, 2015","false","16.8"," 60 of 93 people (65%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","65","60","93","3","9"

The level of optimization is not. Server lag makes combat nearly impossible. For some, the game crashes every 5 to 10 minutes.

Furthermore, I've heard the developer does not put his games on top priority and most likely will not fix these issues any time soon.\n\nI have nothing against the game's concept and how it was put together, it would be a very fun game had these quirks been worked out a little sooner.

However, in this case, I feel it is only fair to let people know a thing or two.\n\nWhat ROK is right now, is the end result.      In that point, the dev's have been honest when they said they won't be adding or changing anything from now on.\n\nThis game has been abandoned.       The dev's will try to tell you otherwise, which just makes them look delusional.\n\nThis game had potential,  but was let down big time.      I can safely say the game was running better in Alpha 6 than after "Release".\n\nFor peope finding that hard to believe and want to know more;  read on.\n-I won't mention cheats, eventhough it was the dev's fault not even thinking about any sort of anti-cheat for a CLIENT-based game.  Hacks were running hot in this game and made many players quit, but almost every online game out there gets those.-\n\n- The only things added during the 1 year Early Access Alpha worth mentioning:\n\n+Ping protected Servers: ( important as this game runs client side based, which basically means,  the higher your ping, the more you lag, the more advantage you have)\n\n+Siege damage adjustment: (So building which took 30hours to build won't be shot to pieces in 15minutes)\n\n+ Crest Totems: (so people can't destroy the totem if crested, and therefore not just put the entire base in their pocket, instead of raiding)\n\nTime between server wipes increased to around 1 Month, from previous 7days.\n\n+A second map.\n\n+A very small change to the guild system, which still is useless.\n\n-Fishing and Farming  ( Fishing being very important for a PvP-Building game apparently)\n\nThats it.    Also worth mentioning these things have taken close to a year to be added.\n\nAnd there has been no improvment to the King System, or any end game content added.\n\nEverything else, like flute tunes and flower dresses can hardly be called content.\n\nNone of the game mechanics or end game content the EA playerbase wanted and suggested was done.\n\n\nThe base game still is the same as at start.  Nothing other has changed from EA launch.  Just more lag.\n\nYou say "oh wait they are still doing bug fixes and performance updates every other month"\n\nGame breaking bugs and glitches have taken more than half a year to even be addressed (Like the popular "bag on head wall glitch" )\n\nThere still is game breaking glitches in the game  (item duping for example)\n\nThese often don't get fixed, just altered.   And every time there is a patch, new bugs appear and performance gets a little worse.\n\n\nI myself had some great fun with this game and hoped for improvment until "Releas" announcement.   But after it has become clear that the game will never improve, (when they announced months before "Release" that Fishing and Farming will be the only things they will implement)  there is nothing that would make me install this game ever again.    Waste of time at the best.\n\nIn my personal opinion and from what I have seen here, CodeHatch are a bunch of amateurs.\n\nNot even the top pinned forum thread "Community Suggestions" has been unpinned or deleted.  After close to a year saying nothing will be added anymore.       - This isn't just laziness,   it is to make people, checking out the forum before buying the game, think that it is still being worked on.\n\n\nOnly a matter of time until this low populated game is fully dead.\n\nGreat potential turned into great failure.\n\n\n\n","May 25","false","379.4"," 20 of 23 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","20","23","0","1"

I went to the server with the best connection possible and set my graphics as low as they could possibly go. Even with all this, the game still ran at 15 frames per second or less.

Made a really good friend, went exploring, collected supplies and then got attacked by a midget yelling your taxes are too high!!! (They were at 2%). Killed him, ran back to my castle with my new friend while being chased by about 15 guys. Took all of our supplies, tossed them over the cliff and then jumped off together.\n\nAll in all this game is loads of fun... sometimes. Its very laggy, even on official servers. The combat is extremely good at times but when it lags it makes it almost imposible to hit or even see where somebody is. In my story above whilst i was fighting the midget, he would be hitting me even though he was way off in the distances to the point where i could barely even see him.\n\nThere are many glitches aswell... although that is to be expected out of a early access title. But some, if i may mention them here, are when you press c to toggle between 1st and 3rd person you will sometimes teleport to a new spawned person somewhere on the beach. When chopping down trees, some of them will fly up into the air and then disapear, animals like dear or moose will do the same thing aswell.\n\nAlso, one major thing that i found was one time i was building my base near the stone nodes and then  randomly teleported onto the thorne. Lets just say the king was a bit suprised... Lol\n\nBut you get my point that this game is not perfect. There are many other glitches to be found like people flying, falling through the map, to randomly dying and loosing all your stuff, getting stuck in one spot and not being able to moove and the list goes on.\n\nBut all in all it has the potential to be a really great game and with some fixes this could be amazing!!\n\nAlso one thing i think should be added is horses that you can tame and ride around on. As well as be able to make armor for them and so on, you get my point. Would make getting around a lot easier :)","March 16, 2015","true","66.9"," 46 of 69 people (67%) found this review helpful 21 people found this review funny","67","46","69","21","0"

Its got a minecraft open world building style, but with simplified resource gathering that is limited to nodes that repop fairly often, I really enjoyed building castles, and upgrading the crafting stations to build better and better items.   The pvp combat system is pretty cool, but can be difficult with lag.   I enjoyed defending my castle with guild mates, but never quite got to the point of trying to be king.   Im not a great PVPer, so the full loot drop can be annoying, but that is part of the game.  No problem there.\n\nThe big problem comes with griefers.  Getting attacked while you are in the game is part of the game, but logging back in after a day away, and fining ALL of you stuff gone kinda ruins it.  Im not sure if there are exploits that allow some people to pick up your stuff, or if they really spent the time to smash every single item, but on our server several people were shocked to find everything that they had built gone.    There is no safe storage, and even when you log out, your body stays in game, and can be killed and looted.   I was on a "NO GRIEFING" server, but it still happens.\n\nAlso, there is no way to identify people until they waive at you.  So you cant tell friend from foe unless they happen to be wearing different armor.  So if someone kills you and takes all of your stuff, you dont even know who to to get revenge on.\n\nSo at this point I am done with this game.  I will watch for updates, and I will be glad to change my recommendation to Yes if they come up with a way to stop griefers.","March 23, 2015","false","78.8"," 21 of 25 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","21","25","0","0"

Sure it is, if there wasn't the "wipe". it\nsounds like an urban myth, like a monster from beneath, but it simply means this: you build a\nbase for 3 days straight? It survived the hackers and little kids who want to destroy your\nstuff? GREAT. Here comes an update, which leads to a total server wipe and ALL your Stuff\nis gone. You wanne try again? Sure, wait for the next wipdate... oh update. Btw. don't play\non official servers, because they are always get wiped with a new update and restart every\n15mins.\n\n7. the character creation of your "champ" is server based. so you have to create on every\nserver a new champion with a new name, appearance and banner. Sure it is fun to create\nsomething new on every server, but why isn't it possible to bind like three champs onto an\naccount (like on champ per profil in 7dtd), which can be later "modified" via potions of\napperance. Why? You can't figure out friend or foe, because on every server the "♥♥♥♥♥♥"\nfrom the last server can be another person on the next. It also helps the hackers =)\n\n8. if you are able to get "steel" it isn't a warp jump from iron, as it was for stone to iron.\nMeaning: your steel weapons only get a +1 dmg more than an equal iron weapon,\nsometimes even the range is worse than with iron. I would a expect a better outcome of\nusing "steel" as +1dmg and a little more damage you can take. ( you have to have charcoal,\noil and iron ore and an upgraded lvl 2 anvil to produce steel)\n\n9. You want to log out? Sure. You want to keep your stuff? Not so sure. Why? If you log out on\nthe field or somewhere not safe, someone will find your "sleeping" body, slaughter you, get\nall your stuff and the next time you log in... guess what, starter beach :) Which also can\nhappen, if somebody breaks your crest and steals all of your base and then still slaughters\nyou.\n\n10. Someone killed you or harassed you?  Wanne see his name? No can't do. Well that is my\nproblem. There are only three ways to see somebodies name:\na. he writes in the chat and admits that he or she enjoys slaughtering newbies at the beach\nor capturing them\nb. somebody, actually is a decent player and waves at you with "g"\nc. you are lucky enough, to punch that idiot in his/her face and his/her name is shown for a\nbrief moment on the  lower right side of your screen\n\n\nconclusion:\n\nI bought this game and played it a lot. It is fun at stages, but more frustrating until a point you don't want to play it anymore. I won't play this game until following things aren't resolved:\n\na. to easy removal of your crest by others which leads to removal of your whole base after putting their crest up\nb. anti hacker tool ( vac, sure)\nc. closable crest (with locks)\nd. a fixed amount of champion creation per account\ne. better feedback of codehatch in regard of their "server wipes" and handling the things\nf. a better balance between steel and iron, because steel is nearly useless in comparison to the jump from wood to iron ( if someone actually uses stone/wood)\ng. the name problem\n\nPS: I don't mind errors I mad while writing this.

If you intend on playing this solo or on a public server get ready for a long dreadful experience in a hacker's dream of a horrible developer creation of an amazing medieval world. If you know anything of these developers then you know they created the alpha starforge and abandoned it after more than a years worth of false promises to backers and its community. However, if your like me and are a stupid fool who doesnt learn after getting bent over once then join me in the stupidity of alpha access games. Where developers make tons of money for making a great initial release of a game hype up its community with promises to come then after seeing sales plummet after a couple months of the initial release decide...hey lets just make a new game instead of pouring hundreds of hours into a game that will make us less in the long run...The direction this game can go is endless, the devs can redeem themselves by creating the best indie game of the year if they just stick to improving the game's engine and adding more content to the game. I do not believe these amateur devs have it in them though. For one, make a good lag free engine game, if these devs were capable of making a decent coded game then this game wouldnt be hacker simulator 2015; starforge and reign of kings are both extremely horrible coded and optimized games. Two, stick with a game that will not make as much money as it has from initial release rather than just making another good initial game with high hopes and promises of future content. Three, atleast change your mom's basement of a company's name from "code][atch" to "get bent backers", eventhough it wouldnt be hard for people to find out where you came from before... still would look better on steam store page.\n\nIf by some miracle these developers decide to stick with supporting the game with further content and optimization then I will take back everything I said about them and their company, but I just dont think these independent amaetur game developers have it in them to deliever on the longevity of their partialy completed games.","March 29, 2015","false","164.4"," 35 of 51 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","35","51","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/3bf/recommended/344760/","3bf","s h l u g","http://steamcommunity.com/id/3bf/","110 products in account","Reign of Kings has some interesting ideas that make it stand out from just another run-of-the-mill Crafting/Survival game. The only problem is utilizing these ideas so that they actually have impact and make the world feel real and unique.\n\nI think it would be interesting if you did not have to pay the King's tax, but doing so runs the risk of the Kingsmen/a tax collector coming after you or putting a bounty on your head. It would also be great if you could become say a Merchant, and sell/barter goods from a stand. As well as if the King could do good things too, like plan cities and organise the people to improve the land on which they all share.\n\nThe character creation and voxel building are good the way they are, and I enjoyed the combat when I played as well. The maps are cool as well, especially the procedural ones.\n\nAll in all, I think Reign of Kings is at an important position in the crafting/survival world; They have all the means to make their game THE definitive medieval crafting survival game, but it is currently stuck as Medieval "Kill-the-man-with-the-ball" and I fear that will not change any time soon. It is for that reason that I cannot currently recommend this game, but if they add some more structure to their already great concept and decent execution, I believe they can become a front runner of the genre, or at least medieval gaming enthusiasts.\n\nAs of 12/16/2015 I will be looking into future updates for RoK and will change my review based on how those updates improve/damage the game.","December 16, 2015","false","13.5"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","15","16","0","0"

Other features from promising failed EA titles like The Stomping Land, where you can trap and cage other players.\n\nOne thing that immediately stood out (please don't ask why) is a certain slot you are able to use. Most FPS games have quickload slots to quickly equip a weapon by pressing 1 2 3 4 5. This game has a slot 0, labeled "orifice", in which you can put sharp objects into in case you get yourself into a sticky situation (captured by another player for example), you can then remove your sharp stone from your orifice and cut yourself free.\n\nAfter playing for a couple hours, I then went to tell my girlfriend about the orifice slot, she seemd really into it. 10/10\n","March 12, 2015","true","172.2"," 37 of 56 people (66%) found this review helpful 30 people found this review funny","66","37","56","30","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/chabochabo/recommended/344760/","chabochabo","chabo chabo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/chabochabo/","115 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nLove this game already. As you can see from my playtime, I'm playing this exclusively since it came out. This is my 4th edit, editting it each day of alpha. TL;DR - Yes the game is very much worth your time, and at 20 dollars it's a steal. I would recommend it up to 40 dollars tbh.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMOST IMPORTANT IMO - SANDBOX FACTOR: Obscenely high! Everyone wants to make a sandbox game these days, and almost all of them fall short of the most important thing: something to DO that feels meaningful. With these other titles, you start the game, you make your fortress/grind out top end crafting, and you're done. The game is over. If PVP is a thing you defend it, but it's live or die and respawn.\n\nIn this game, you have a king who constantly taxes you. That guy is the worst. All of your activities as a little islander peasant are constantly accompanied by a sense of something more: either you're working towards gearing up to take on the king, or you're working towards making your little shack in the woods to gank people at, or you're building an impenetrable fortress to house your max level crafting tables and hoard of materials.\n\nThere's no other way to put it: with the perma death, loot loss, always-existing (when you log out you're just laying there in the game, asleep and vulnerable)  and the options for imprisoning and such, the game feels meaningful, and not like another empty sandbox.\n\nAs far as gankfest goes: On a server with a large popualtion of new players, the "spawning beach" rapidly devolves into a Rust-style "beat people with sticks senselessly" idiot-fest. However, on servers with stable populations, people ratehr quickly evovle past that. Ocne you get some armor on, I woul say 1 out of every 5 or so people you encoutner will kill on sight. Most are just trying to build their little home and don't wanna fight to the death over some berries.\n\nWhich brings us to the real glory of this game. The sandbox is so real. remember how ArcheAge offered us player housing? Remember Star Wars Galaxies, where you built wherever and made it home? This game has what you want. Build a structure and hang a crest on the wall, and no one can build within a certain radius unless they breach your walls (which requires siege equipment at higehr tiers, and a double thick wood wall would take 45 minutes to break a one-tile hole through) and take out the crest. No one can minecraft-style build a little bridge and hop your wall if you have a creat up and you build intelligently. You can absolutely have your own fort... and once the server grows, everyone is eyeballing their neighbor and thinknig about what some siege equipment would be like...\n\n\nCOMBAT: Intuitive but currently not that deep. I think it needs a man-at-arms dodge a la Chivalry and that alone will add 90% of the needed depth. I say this because the combat currently boils down to attack and block, since there's no quick-step and overhead/jab do not alter the damage you deal. Very promising, but not quite there yet. Ranged is where it's at, mostly because the melle is definitely not at a Chivalry level of depth, but since they're aiming to model after Chivalry, I have high hopes here.\n\n\nCRAFTING: Incredible. Upgrade workbenches to unlock better/more complex items to craft. Resources are scattered and scarce enough that it's not as easy as making a little fort and investing time to unlock everything. You're going to have to wander out and find where each thing spawns, gather and come back, it's that simple. Adds to the meaningful sandbox feel.\n\n\nSURVIVAL: Food and water are a thing, but this isn't Project Zomboid levels of survivalism. The primary risk is players/wild animals, which is how I feel it should be. The hunger/thirst are tuned in such a way that you can spend 80+% of your game time doing things other than gathering food/water, which I feel is a great balance.\n\n\nPRICE POINT: It's 20 bucks man. That's dirt cheap, and considering that the game feels like a full game already, 5 hours into launch, I think it's an extremely solid investment. Updating now on day 3, and I would gladly have paid 40 dollars for this game as-is now. I'll be very surprised if the price doesn't go up as the game develops, as I can see this being a big hit.\n\n---Updated for Day 3 of Alpha release--\n\nNo wipes, and there have been patches. Devs are actively working on this title. According to McDuderstein in the comments, the devs are posting on the RoK Facebook page when they are taking servers down for testing, which is great.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBugs I've Heard of:\n\nI've heard that sometiems doors will be closed client side, but register as still being open server side. I've never experiecned it, but I recommend building multiple doors at your entrance just in case.\n\nBugs I've experienced:\n\nSometimes you'll try to itneract with a workbench, or attack, and nothing will happen. Logging otu and back in usually resolves, if not close the client and re-open.\n\nSometimes you'll attack an enemy and not see any damage markers, they won't die, etc. You're probably de-synced; again, close the client and re-launch and it should resolve. It's a good idea to whack an animal every so often to check for this: I had a 30 minute excursion of gathering earlier, attacked a werewolf on the way back, didn't do damage and realized I was bugged. when I re-logged, I was back at the base, and my whole excursion had taken place in de-sync land, meaning it never happened. Not too brutal, but a bit of a waste of time.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThose are the only bugs I've experienced! Again, I think at 20 dollars the game is a steal, and I would feel perfectly fine if I'd paid 30. Highly recommend the game, and the only things I see needing improvement are combat depths, server stability, and lag (you get serverwide lag spikes every so often when the server is close to full). Server stabiltiy seems to be their primary focus right now, which is quite alright with me!","March 11, 2015","true","124.9"," 45 of 71 people (63%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","63","45","71","7","2"

I find a sleeping guy, so I instictively bash him with my club, as any sensible person would do to a sleeping man. I pick up his stuff, and he is loaded as ****. He drops full steel armour and a sword, plus a bunch of wood. With this, I decide to become king. I walked up the giant sword-bridge to the throne, and there is a group of morbidly obese people, whom I presume are Americans overloaded with McDonalds, in full armour. So, I decide to attempt at killing them in order to become king. I manage to kill them all, and I take the throne. After becoming king, I decided to name my newfound country "The Holy Moisturizing Lotion", in the god of my religion's name. I set the taxes to 5%, and try to be a nice king. I hop off of my throne, I walk forward, fall down 30 feet, and die. I then was KOS'd repetively by the same obese people.

No skill at all is needed as the club stuns you and resets all combat animations. I have tested this several times, and even as king, you can be rekt by a single dude swinging a damn stick against a man in steel armor and a 7ft flamberge. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.\n\nSiege equipment- takes a ton of resources to make and to make ammo for. On the up side, you can load the stupid thing with so much ammo that one shot can take out an entire wall of stone (and no I don't mean cobble, I mean the top tier stone) that is 4 thick. I can literally spend a day getting and crafting 500 shots, and then go to the biggest and baddest base, and 2 shot it to oblivion. Woo friggin hoo.\n\nLack of any anticheat or region locks- this, this right here, is the biggest detriment to this game. The fact that I , along with 13 others, held the throne on a server for 2 weeks, just to have 4 asian hackers fly in and remove all of our crests, made me give up entirely. 4 people was all it took to kill a server.. 4. I saw these 4 ♥♥♥♥tards on several other servers, with much the same result. They came in, removed all the crests from player bases, spawned in trebs and ammo, and ♥♥♥♥ed an entire server. We held them off for four days hoping that they would just get tired of being owned over and over, they could have cared less. And so could codehatch.\n\nOverall- don't get the game. Official servers are rife with hackers and griefers. Private servers are rife with morons and rpers with stupid rules. Do yourself a favor, if you feel like getting this game, bash yourself in the face with your keyboard. YOu'll feel like doing that anyways after a few hours on an official server.","September 14, 2015","false","154.5"," 20 of 26 people (77%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","77","20","26","2","0"

Real Combats like in the trailers are oftentimes never the case. Combat mostly is limited to laggy peeking with a sword or getting stuck in random trees.

On the other hand, one of the mayor aspect of the game, is combat. Ofcourse it is. Why, I hear you ask? Because this is PVP Medieval, including Raiding game. By all means, you might just get destroyed, because the blocking sucked, or the hitbox failed. It is simple, yet Clungy. Take a hit, block or just spam.

Official is as its name official server by the makers. But Official servers have several major disadvantages. 1: No rules so there is no mercy and nothing to restrain everything besides the crests which only provide a less than moderate protection. 2: They are almost always super crowded and every good base location is taken. With this many people with no restraints basicly everyone is a bandit and you will be killed A LOT unless you put hundreds of hours into this game. And then there are the Community servers which people who bought servers can make the rules and have admins to keep order. Seems like a good idea right? Well as a person who had lots of experince with these servers here is what i can say: 1. After a while on the no Kos servers with your epic base you realize: you have no enemies and this base is nothing. If you wanted to play a building and collecting simulator than play Minecraft. Yah because all of these games have are there raiding and fortress building to prevent raiders. 2: The admins are (ussualy) super strict and give no warnings to when they are going to ban, hell they ban if they dont like you. This game could be so much more and can be a good game if it were a game that could be atleast a bit inviting and one way they could do this is probably making offline raiding harder. The crest protection thing costs so much that it only benifits big guilds who have lots of things to protect themselves. So bassicly the people who play this game are those who make this game bad (and of course bad game design). I will probably play this game agian when these problems are fixed.

At all. If you intend to play this game alone, in a non-competitive manner or simply want to build castles in a medieval sandbox game, look elsewhere. This game and everything about it is, well, competition. If you cannot deal with loss, whether you had opportunity to deter it or not, don't bother. Fair warning given.\n\n\n---\n\nCombat: Simplified / not as polished, Chivalry-like combat with a limb and parts health limitation. That said, I'm not complaining. Blocking, countering and general combat is simple and easy to grasp. Gear makes a pretty decent difference but a skilled player can and will easily out do a person with superior gear.\n\nMap: It's actually perfect, for now. The resource nodes for important materials are in locations that actually demand eventual conflict. The map itself actually looks pretty damn good and the map's size isn't anything that I personally can complain about. Players should have no problems establishing castles or hovels around the map.\n\nGeneral Gameplay: As I said with the paragraph above, it's all competitive play. People will screw you over and given the opportunity, you can, should and probably will do the same. Don't come into the game expecting to be untouchable and don't come into the game alone. These things considered, it's a really entertaining game to play with friends. A few bugs do exist here and there but, it's Alpha. The hell do you expect?\n\n\n- It should be noted that they've begun arming admin staff with methods of effectively removing players that are using hacked clients. If you are genuinely having issues with hackers and the sort, I suggest NOT playing on official servers. Instead, look into a community server with generally active and competent admin staff.","March 30, 2015","true","147.9"," 33 of 51 people (65%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","65","33","51","3","0"

If you are not excited to play this game in its current state, then you should wait to see if the game progresses further in development."\n\nI understand that this game is new, and that there will be bugs and everything of the sort. I can tolerate the bugs, and the glitches and the framerate because it -is- an Early Access game, I can even deal with the people who KoS. It's not going to be perfect from the start.\n\nI picked up this game because I liked the premise. I'm a huge medival game fan, and a game where you could literally become King? Heck yeah! I held off on my initial purchase and watched videos on YouTube just to see how the game would be. And I instantly liked it. So I bought it, and gave it a go myself, and I had a really good starting experience.\n\nI found a server that I liked, and began playing. And I wasn't instantly killed by some naked man, which made it all the better. I found a nice spot to build, and spent literally all night building this house surrounded by a stone wall. I made friends, killed a couple players because they tried to steal my stuff. And was eventually in full steel armor and steel sword. And this is where things went south.\n\nI was returning to my home base, and found a man in full steel building blocks to jump into my base. I tried to communicate to him through the VoIP, to no responce. My house was fully locked up and there wasnt anything he could do that wouldnt take serious time and me preventing him to. Then I discovered he was a hacker. And in the span of two minutes, my base was demolished, I was dead, and all the resources I had spent time to gather were gone.\n\nThat was my biggest problem. Hackers are literally running free and doing whatever they want to whoever they want with no repercussions. I've read the reviews and I know I'm not the only one who's had this problem.

Aside from the community of the game has devolved greatly, and it can take some time to find a server with a decent player base. The game runs for ♥♥♥♥ so you can end up lagging around and this sucks when you end up in combat. Speaking of combat, if you play Chivalry Medieval Warfare, it's the same system as it was copied, works and feels the same. Getting gear is rather easy as long as you know where to look and remember the map well enough, some servers just have commands for gear like leather and iron swords. Now on to the throne, this is basically a way of saying "Here I am, I'm the King, kill me". People with either petition for lower taxes, I prefered lowering by just .01 percent(5%-4.99%), or just try and kill you because they wish to be King. One of the pluses to the game is it really encourages RP play and if you find a good enough server it can be fun. If you want to play you will want to have 2-3 friends at least so when you're out and about you won't get dominated by larger groups.","January 23","false","29.1"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","87","13","15","2","0"

My favorite weapons would be Bow and arrow & Axe or mace.\n\nBuilding takes forever but its well made in my oppinion since it makes sense that one person shouldnt be able to build a massive castle within a day. so bring friends :)\n\nThis game if you're planning to play on Public servers... are somewhat KOS. however joining community servers gives you a better experience since they usually have some kind of rules that are enforced by admins.. usually active ones but not always. so dont quote me on that.\n\nNow....\n\nThis will summarize my first 2 hours in this game..\n\nI join into a server with my friends, it had a nice ping of around 44 so i thought hell yea!\nWell in, im confronted with nice pretty graphics and a stick to beat down trees with if i need to wich i do since its the only way to progress unless someone gives you stuff or there is a /kit function on the server.\n\nI happily cut down some trees and explore the Crownland map and i see a yellowish field infront of me.. i run to it and think this has to be some kind of desert or something. (actually Hay field).\n\nIm now around 150m away from said field and my computer freezes.. ALL STOP IN THE ENGINE ROOM! basicly..

Let's star first with the fact that you could work for hours building your fort, crafting weapons, and gathering resources. When you log back in, all of that could be gone by either other players, or the server shuts down. And the combat system is horrendous on top of the constant lag the game has from time to time.\nI was willing to think "hey, this is an early access game. Maybe there will be improvements?" I deleted the game from my computer, but it seems that they are still working on this game.

Early access needs to stop existing. Stop allowing devs to get all the money and quit on games before they even can be called beta. This game is alpha, filled with bugs. Some of the worst game physics I've seen, so many obvious features not in the game such as horse, battering rams, siege towers, ships, maybe a proper auction house style trading system and much more. Being a king in this game is really pointless. You log off or aren't near the throne and someone goes to sit on it. The king has no real meaning other then raising taxes to collect taxes from the tax tree and if you raise taxes you just end up getting killed for it anyways. The devs are a joke and sickening money grabbers. This game could of at least sold a million copies with proper development and still have a player base currently. These devs are bad for the industry as well as the valve is bad for the industry with the creation of early access feture. It shows no care for the consumer and I can't wait for the day when these companies bankrupt due to being so not trusted that nothing they develop gets bought.\n\nSave yourself the money and don't buy this dissappointment of a game and stop feeding devs that don't deserve anything other then unemployment.","January 28","false","33.6"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","12","15","0","1"

Making guilds with people you don't personally know is dangerous. You can either give them no rights in which they are useless, or full rights, with nothing stoping them from stripping down your house and resources and leaving in the dead of night. The combat barely works, many situations with me hitting allies that are behind me. Easy anti-cheat disallows things such as the razor game booster from launching, but since launch I have not seen the end of hackers. And if you don't watch a specific person doing the hack, the report system is all but useless. And now with the game planning to be realeased from Alpha to completion in 2015, it seems this is another project code Hatch is "finished" (Given up on.) If you want to know how to play this game, collect no resources, that's for scrubs. Just go find someone, break into their home because no matter how they build it, you can, and kill them and take their stuff. Or hack. Because that still works.

The biggest problem is not related to the game´s design or programming, but the RIDICULOUS amount of hacks that players are using without any restriction. That really makes the entire experience become annoying and unpleasant. The game designers should also look forward to make buildings a little bit harder to invade because all it takes is a easy to do catapult. Besides all that, I really liked the game and I hope the fix this cheating problem soon and minor bugs.","August 13, 2015","true","16.8"," 23 of 37 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","23","37","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/madjokerking/recommended/344760/","madjokerking","Dallas","http://steamcommunity.com/id/madjokerking/","31 products in account","This game has a great concept, in theory.  I can't say that I havent enjoyed playing it.  The environmental graphics are superb. The background music is very nice as well.  That being said.. lets focus on the bad for what its worth.\n\nFirstly, since the beginning the hackers have destroyed any semblance of fair play in the game.  It really is sickening to create an impenetrable abode, and find it in ruin the next day.\n\nHackers arent really the fault of the developers and they have made strides to counter the pieces of @$#% that choose to exploit. But its an uphill battle with no real end in sight.\n\nSecondly the pvp in this game is attrocious. Essentially, its frantic button mashing and jumping around like an idiot.. and in the end its rarely about skill, as much as it's about your equipment, and dumb luck.\n\nThirdly even if hackers aren't involved there always seems to be douch bags on every server that are able and willing to raid your base at night and take or destroy the hours and hours of work, you put into your creation. As this really is part of the game, it just seems a glaring design flaw to expect players to keep coming back to try again and again everyday. And you do come back, with better plans everytime.. but after time the frustration becomes too much.\n\nAnd lastly, and this might just be me, but.. The developers have just announced that they are going to try and do a monthly wipe on the first of every Tuesday. So if you are finally able to get any semblance of a base and supplies stockpiled, you definatley wont have it for too long. Because after the wipe.. you start all over ... from scratch... nada.. zippo.. ziltch. . not even a toon to call your own.\n\nThis last point is the most frustrating of all to me. All the other challenges I take in stride. Trying to overcome them is almost a game in and of themselves. But now It's all pointless to me, because I know any struggles I overcome will all mean nothing once they wipe. Whats the point..","January 31","false","196.7"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

The concept is great and would make a perfect survival game, thats if it was executed properly. I love building things, I love raiding, I love fighting in PvP. But, there is severe problems with the game.\n\nThis game is plagued by chinese with over 300 ping which makes the PvP in the game a joke. Half time I am fighting someone with a high latency and they can hit me when I cannot even see them. This makes people with full steel gear lose to a naked. Not fun...\n\nAnother huge issue is the fps. Even with an extreme gaming rig I seem to drop to 10 fps on the lowest settings, making fighting almost impossible. I have no idea why this is happening, but most likely to do with the renderer and the awful engine.\n\nIf the developers actually listened, maked regular updates to the game, fixed the horrible servers and brang in ping detection to get rid of all the chinese, the game would be great.

I could smell barbecue in the air, my belly rumbled and I decided to run towards it. As I got nearer to the fire on the beach I could see 4 little people running around it and dancing. I stopped running and walked. “Hey guys!” I shouted. They stopped moving and slowly turned towards me. One started to play the drums and another the flute, I started to laugh and complement them as the tune they were creating was very good. The two other midgets came closer, one shouted “Hmmm tasty” as they walk towards me. He out of know got a gigantic iron sword. I immediately halted, “Hey, I come in peace”.\nI lost sight of the other small guy but he had actually ran behind me. As the midget with the massive sword came towards me, the midget behind me tied me. My body suddenly flopped. “What are you doing!” I shouted on the top of my voice. “We are doing what we must do” said one of the little guys. They put me onto a Guillotine. “You don’t have to do this, I wasn’t going to do anything” I cried.\nOut of no where a guy approaches. “Put that wee lad down” he says as I smell a sour onion sort of smell caress the air. “IS that… is it… thats…. It’s Shrek!” I Call out. “Help me please” He reveals his ogre sized sword and destroys the midgets. “Oh your my hero mr shrek!” he keeps me in the guillotine and strokes my forhead, he says “I child, nothing to be scared now. I’m here wee boy” As he walks behind me. “whaa aren’t you going to let me out?” I ask, “Not yet” I feel being whispered into my left ear with his warm onion breath.\n\nThat was the last I ever saw of this guy, as my computer decided to disconnect from the internet. The mystery is that my body would have been there left logged in for a few minutes… I wonder if I did ever get set free.\n\n\n17/5.6 would defiantly order from this seller again!","April 12, 2015","true","13.8"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","89","8","9","8","0"

Poor Optimization, laggy combat, ruined sieging system, hackers still galore, and much, much more still seems unfinished.\n\nMy quick Summary\nPlease, just please. Don't buy this game, or any further games released by this Developer, they are NOT to be trusted to finish optimizing, and fixing the issues with their games! I sincerely regret buying this game when it was Rated "Very Positive" and it was all the talk on YouTube.\n\nThe game is horribly optimized, you will need a strong computer to run anything above Low grapichs for a solid FPS. Combat is still just as laggy as it was during EA. The Siege system is utterly ruined, especially with those Totems... And Hackers, the Hackers are still at large. There are a TON more issues with this game.\n\nApparently, a 900$ Computer can't run this game for Sh*t. To prove how unoptimized this game is, I can run games like PLANETSIDE 2, ROME Total War II, War Thunder, CSGO, Minecraft, Garrys Mod, STALKER, Skyrim, X-Rebirth, on atleast MEDIUM graphics, and get around 40 FPS. I mean...  WHAT!?  How poorly Optimized is this!? I can't even run this game on it's lowest Graphics!? The Graphics look like PS1 on the lowest setting! So please tell why the ♥♥♥♥ can't I run this on the lowest Graphics without my Framerate DYING!?\n\n\n\nSimilar games you should definently check out, they sure are alot better then this unifinished mess.\nI suggest checking out Ark: Survival Evolved. If you don't have a good computer, it will soon be coming out on the PS4, and Xbone.\n\nUnsimilar games\nSouth Park: The Stick of Truth","December 16, 2015","false","3.3"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","11","15","2","0"

On several of our visits he killed us, captured us, tortured us, and even intended to whip to our backs while we were bent over and bound to pillories.  The final time I tried to visit him he tied me up, threw me in a cage, and tried to stone me to death as I pleaded for my life.  When he raised taxes on the land to 20% he finally gave us the fuel we needed to inspire and rally an army of common folk to finally storm the castle, and slay him once and for all.

First of all, Combat here is COMPLETELY client-sided, So if you hit someone on your screen, It will count as a hit. That makes combat really glitchy and sometimes unfair. Second of all, Some weapons need rebalancing. I got sick of getting killed by some midgets that have a steel halberd and wasting my precious metal on armor that is completely useless.

If anything, the problem has increased dramatically. If you're not being one-shotted, constant report spamming will ban you for life.\n\nSeems, Codehatch, has given up on fixing the bugs people report. They just take the offending program code out, and that's it.\n\nThe whole PvP core of the game, seems non-exsitent. Other than players killing each other (including one-shot hackers), the whole castle-raiding thing just isn't there. No castles collapsing into a pile of rubble. You just create holes big enough to get inside, steal what you can, then run back to your castle before your opponent is done repairing theirs.\n\nThere hasn't been anything from the developers for months. No update or bug repair reports, answering the concerns of the players, just nothing.\n\nPlease don't buy this game, even if you plan on renting a private server. Youtubers and other live streamers dropped this game a long time ago, and I believe there's a few 100 players still loyal.\n\nI've reported this game, and Starforge, to Steam.

Expect your connection to buckle under this game, for playing this game while on teamspeak proved an impossible feat. It was impossible to connect to any server - official or community, local or overseas - while running any other program that used any considerable amount of bandwidth. Most every other game I have ever played can handle teamspeak 3 in the background in addition to music streaming and other things, but this game is not up to that task.\n\nOnto what little gameplay I experienced, it is lackluster. Gathering resources is an abhorrent, boring task. At the rate of collection and simply finding resources to collect, this game is worse than most other survival games in many regards - even those noted for their occasional sparsity of resources. The gameplay itself, in what little was experienced, was terrible on all fronts - especially the receiving end of 'combat', which is a complete disaster. The combat combined with the latency and bandwidth issues made it possible for me to be attacked with a six inch dagger from over twenty feet away, ruining any chance of response and making fights entirely one sided.\n\nBut the community -- oh, dear lord, the community. If you for some reason purchase this trainwreck of a game, stay away from official servers. They are plagued with people who are playing on the wrong servers and have horrible ping, scream in voice chat and fill up with text chat with intelligible conversations. In addition, this game is worse than DayZ with regards to the KOS mentality, with the combat system contributing to the problem due to its non-parity and numerous engine problems.\n\nThe only possible positive this game can muster to draw from its ♥♥♥♥ crusted pile of dung is the graphics, which are good for the intensity they place upon the user's system and the tradeoff of apperance. But it numerous drawbacks with a sort of pseudo-motion blur being pervasive, even after disabling motion blur itself, with pixel dragging and visual distortion on numerous levels of graphic settings.\n\nSave yourself the money, and just go buy Rust.","January 2","false","0.7"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","8","10","2","0"

There's nothing innately wrong with the gameplay or the style, and the character creation is downright hilarious, which is a plus.   But there is something to be said about the fact that this is just another survive and build game, very similar to rust, but with the twist of a "King" that resides in a castle (on the original map) and is able to tax the people of the server.  This is interesting, and gives some forced role play which can be somewhat interesting even if you aren't usually into RPing.  The main problem with this game is it's optimization, which can and hopefully will be fixed, I have a reasonably strong computer that's able to deal with many games that are much nicer than this, but just like DayZ and to a certain extent rust, this game has some optimization issues.  Survival Building games like this truly cannot be played well without a team of friends to play with.  If you are alone you'll probably survive one to three nights before getting raided and essentially losing all reason to play.  Survival Building games like this also call for some insane amount of time to be spent playing them, so if you are interested.  Strap in as it will take a long time to get just about anything done.\n\nI'll break it down easy peasy below so you don't have to read all that if you don't want to.\n\nPros:\nHilarious Character Creation\nEasy Learning Curve\nSimple Mechanics\nFun if you like to build and survive (in video games)\nInteresting Forced Role Play\n\nCons:\nIt's just another builder survival game\nOptimization is horrible\nRust is probably better overall...\nYou basically need a group of at least three people to strive.\n\nI wouldn't recommend it to be honest, but it's really not horrible if you think you'd like to pick it up and have some friends to play with.\n\n","April 14","false","27.0"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

Creative, varied, oppressive, dominant, completely crackhead in the soul! BUY IT!\n\n\nFIRST REVIEW /11th MARCH 2015:  This game is good fun! Smooth and playable at most, i bet it will become addictive in the future, at the beginning i was playing in an empty server, but i realized that is way more fun in a full one, that holds at the moment around 20 players.\n\nTO BE AN ALPHA THIS GAME GIVES A GOOD APPROACH AND APPEARS TO BE WELL THOUGHT:\nThe character personalization looks fun and quite complete, compare to many other survivals where you are constraint on a standard model. Gathering and Crafting are easy to understand and not stressing at all, you start with a club and you can collect already wood and several plants in order to craft something. Wildlife and enemies like monsters are varied and very challenging, PvP combat is interesting and requires some skills, cause i got killed from a freshly spawned guy for example while i was equipped with a full wood armor and a better club, as well as some throwing stones, yet i died, maybe he was hacking, who knows, this is just a VERY FIRST IMPRESSION of the game, but i find it polished enough to be at this state, a really good start indeed! I will upgrade the review as soon as i play a bit more, thumbs up at the moment!","March 11, 2015","true","31.4"," 20 of 33 people (61%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","61","20","33","3","0"

After about 2 hours in everyone was killing people that where working together taking gear saying sorry that they would return their stuff just to kill them again. So after that I decided I would find a small area hidden from everyone to just get my feet wet. Everything was going well and durning that time frame about an hour or 2 people kept killing the new king and they would raise taxes to 40% or more. That slowed me down because it takes I beleive 40 wood to make one block for your house. After I finely finished my house and a bed to sleep on I decided to get off for a while. I decided to log on before bed just to be on the safe side to make sure no one broke in. Well there was two blocks missing from my house but they did not kill me or loot my place since I really didn't have anything that they couldn't gather in acouple of mins. so I decided to be tricky and double block my house and hide my loot crates under the floor so I could sleep at night not worring about anyone robbing me. The next day was my day off from work so I deided I would get a early start to building a wall and traps around my place to be extra safe. Well I logged in dead and my bed was broken so I had to spawn on a random spot on the beach half dead (not really sure why since when I fisrt logged in every bar was full.) Ayway I decided to go find my place and when I got there half of my base was gone and replaced leaf blocks and in the front there was a sign that said China #1. So I got into chat since everyone hates the Chinese I asked them to help me take my base back but no one answered me they was all to busy trash talking every other. So after a while I broke in and killed everyone inside and their beds. They had a lot of rare items I knew I wouldn't be able to defend by myself so I asked if anyone wanted to team up and take all their loot and everyone just talked trash to me. I then decided to throw everything into the ocean so no one could have it and then quit. The game itself isn't to bad they had a great idea.  I guess you can say the community ruined the game. I would not buy this game unless you have at lease 5 people or more to play with that will be on at all times of the day. It's just to easy to lose everything meaning... To build an okay house and sig you need to claim land it would take about 4 hours or so. Once you log off someone can come and break down your door or wall in about 10 mins or less and then break your sig in about 5 mins and then claim then they have a nice base and you have nothing. Think the game would be better if they had pvp servers and a hardcore pvp. Meaning in pvp you can kill anyone that is in the open but you can't break into their base it's like a safe zone in normal MMORPG's. Then in the hardcore pvp you aren't safe anywhere.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bunnyguy1/recommended/344760/","bunnyguy1","Bunnyguy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bunnyguy1/","26 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nReign of Kings, while in early alpha, shows a lot of promise to being a game that I could regularly play and want to play with friends. That being said, there are a ton of mechanics that should be implemented to make the game what it could fully be instead of the base outline it feels like right now, as well as a ton of things that need to be changed in order to make the game more playable and fair.\n\nFirst of all, what I liked. The learning curve is not too bad. It gets harder as you progress, but there's a friendly community and a wiki page to help with later game crafting and building. Not only that, but the building in this game is so satisfying. The hours I've sunk in have resulted in some of the most badass looking fortresses and castles I could ever have imagined. And the feeling you get after hours of mining when you put on a suit of steel armor like the knights of old is one of the coolest moments in the game.\n\nNow, on to what i hated. This game is frustrating. Like, Dark Souls level frustrating. The amount of materials you need to acquire to get basic building blocks is a bit ridiculous and really stalls out the building process. And the blocks that you can build quickly are so weak it takes any new character 10 minutes to break in and steal all your stuff. The character creator has little to no variability, with deformed, creepy looking characters being the majority of what you see and taking away from the gameplay experience. Combine that with the glitches that characters can do based on their height and weight, it makes the game unfair and forces you to have setbacks that shouldn't really be there. I've lost tons of bases due to midgets hopping on each others' backs and boosting over walls or going under rocks that normal sized people get stuck on.\n\nThe combat is sticky and buggy at best. I don't have a high end rig, but every battle I get into ends up with me lagging out and ending up dead within seconds despite having better gear and armor. The ranged mechanics are average at best, but with little to no hit detection on other players, you can't really use a bow on someone. Oh, and armor is useless in this game. All it does is slow you down. People with starter clubs can beat down people in steel suits of armor like its made of aluminum foil. You're better off avoiding anyone at all than risking a fight.\n\nLastly, the resources are so stupidly placed. You have to run around to find a dirt "node" to harvest dirt when you have been running on nothing but dirt for hours. Iron and Stone are always surrounded by either a lot of players or hostile wildlife, neither of which will let you get away with hard earned resources.\n\nI've ranted for a bit, but like I said, the game shows promise. If the developers added in RPG elements, it could be a fantastic game that rewards the time you put into it. As of right now, however, its simply not a fun experience for invested Roleplay players or passive players. If/when these issues are addressed, I will be happy to play the game to my fullest extent. Until then, avoid it.","June 23, 2015","false","67.7"," 14 of 22 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","14","22","0","0"

I think that the players limit will be  80 people no more. Currently 0/60 servers. Logically no mounts (yet). This very good for now.\n\nSandbox: trees, water, shrubs, minerals, animals in general. (Destructible objects).\n\nFree building: You can build freely everywhere. It is simple and fast. As a note, there are domain objects (3x levels) that allow dominate an area and can not be built near by other players, more than 1 domain object by player. This closes pretty spiral sandbox. 6 levels of building blocks, the last one damaged by catapults. Can not modify field.\n\nCrafting: About 3 lvl per station, not too big but not too small, it's ok for now.\n\nOpen world pvp: pvp exists wherever you go, no safe zones.\n\nPvp (combat): Ok, people this is FPS and three factors are determined: Ping + FPS + Hitbox. As pvp player, for me it's pretty ok but need fix better. Spears, bows, crossbows, stones, swords, axes, hammers, knives, 2h sword, 2h polearm 2h, 2h ax .... differents damage, attack speed and animatios (Please include shield when you can !!!). "Skills buttons (for example)": 6x differents attacks, parry 1x, 1x run / walk, jump 1x, 1x food, water 1x, 1x bandage, 1x range weapon, fast melee weapon 1x, 1x 2h weapon. Amputations are massive. In general is little buggy yet but funny.\n\nFull loot and build destruction: Full loot is total and build destruction depend of the tier of voxels, defense / durability grow with level, last level only get damage with catapult damage (they are real expensive).\n\nKing of hill: This mode is funny and create a special role playing. Actually i am in court of king and the life is wonderfull :D, I go down to the valley to gank my vassals, tax system (1-20%), so funny.\n\nClans: Family system,it's ok but poor for the moment, nothing to worry.\n\nPlayer Creation: I can only say is the Machine creator of trolls, laughing. It is very complete. (Please add Girls and more content in general to more laughter)\n\nEnviroment: In general i like it. Dawn, day, afternoon, evening, night; Lighting is so good but I think they should make more long transition for example 2 hours, at the time is too short like 30 mins. Rain and fog very well implemented.\n\nPVE village: Exist 1 npc village with monsters. Not experience yet, monsters are strong atm and need a special potion for go inside, the air is poisoned.\n\nCapture system: I still have no experience preferred direct killing. But it sounds fun especially to maintain controlled enemy players that are good in pvp or simple trolls.\n\nAll this sounds very nice but there are things I do not like:\n\n1. The general beach respawn should control more (cooldown??), and even put it further, (Currently exist respawn system in beds like rust and is perfect).\n\n2. General optimization server: keep in mind this is a free building with "good graphics more or less", is a challenge for companies, but i hope that they can control and optimize the maximum. I think they could put a limit of voxels construction by player.\n\n3. FPS combat, is ♥♥♥♥ing funny but need better fix the hitbox, and 2nd point influences this point. Animations and jumping movements should also improve.\n\n4. Possible Upgrades: + large map + players per server + content + another king and create two regions.\n\nIn General sandbox is close and very funny but need optimization.\n\n**Sorry for wall of text and my gispsie english.\n\nBless","March 13, 2015","true","52.0"," 15 of 24 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","15","24","0","0"

It had an amazing idea, but failed miserably when trying to execute it. Usually I don't give games flak for their technical issues (unless they are wide-spread issues and not limited to a minority). But this bug is so common that I will not be surprised if a lot of refunds are being processed at the moment; Australian's can't join the only two Aussie servers. I've had to joined 250+ ping servers. It's unplayable. The lag is too great. I have a great rig (4770k, 980Ti, 10gb RAM, etc) and I can't even 60 FPS on Medium graphics. The crafting system is okay, the King system is okay. The game is okay. I am refunding because it is literally unplayable for me. I hope to buy again if they fix these bloody issues.

Now Rust is a fine game, you may be thinking being likened to it is no bad thing but I found for me at least it had no real long term playability. RoR in its current form generally will encourage the worst in most players, what I mean by that is going around killing other players and wrecking their accomplishments. It is standard practice for most survival open world games, which is easy to understand because without a story or objectives there's little for players to really do.\nRoK has some pretty major balance issues for instance the trebuchet which can be loaded with 1000's of ammunition in a single shot which will just melt any wall you choose to build giving nothing you build any real longevity/durability and all the armour just feels wrong for instance I don't think in any reality someone with a wooden club should be able to kill someone else in head to toe steel plate armour\nBut in spite of all that I did enjoy the majority of my 100 hours, due heavily to the fact that the server I mainly played was populated with generally nice people who liked abit of role play, now I generally felt a little uncomfortable with the whole RP thing but over time I came to really appreciate  it , it adds colour to an otherwise kill people, build/wreck stuff experience, RoK just added a two ingredients a guild system and throne, then in this framework the server created a town, guilds with mutual defence agreements a sudo police force and a church with daily services.\nI am in conclusion hopeful about this games future development, although unless you know of a server with top notch admins i would wait to see if the problems are being resolved before buying, hacker issues have been well documented  bad game balance etc all are issues which are fixable and if the developers concentrate on how players can better work together by further developing the guild system having other objectives to rally around like separate taxable regions and making it so new to server players cant just kill anyone or wreck stuff within a couple of hours RoK may be a game you could play week in week out instead of being something you get bored of within a week","March 29, 2015","true","216.5"," 17 of 28 people (61%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","61","17","28","4","2"

And when ROK came out, I didn't know that it was behind the guys who made Starforge.\n\nThen I looked up some info, then learned starforge, a game in early access, was cancelled.\n\nThis game is going to get cancelled, and be in early access limbo, forever horrible to play, the future updates will ruin the game.\n\nPlease, don't give these "Developers" money for unfinished, trash games.

People are buying less and less early access games, causing games to simply stop being produced, and usually, ones of lower quality. Their actions, are ruining steam. Please, just pirate this game and get it over with. Don't help the problem, control it. Buy something else like Rust, or Nuclear Throne. Those games are more entertaining.\n\nAND ONTO THE REVIEW!\n\nThis game's gameplay is repetitive, and boring. One day, you have a base. The next hour, it gets raided due to the small size of the map, and how easy it is to get siege tools. The game is utterly unbalanced, and people simply block the bridge so others can't get the crown. Making everyone get %90 tax. The customization is also broken, if your character is the smallest midget ever, you can dodge EVERY attack. This is WORSE THAN TEMPER TANTRUM. It's broken, and it's buggy. It's also optimized horribly, I had to fix the damn game MYSELF because it won't run that well on an $800 computer. The graphics are poor, and has the gameplay of a walking simulator.\n\n1/10.","January 4","false","1.6"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","8","11","2","4"

They've been rolling out updates for this game as well. So all the people saying "Don't get this game because it's buggy." What the hell were you expecting? You already know that early access "pre-alpha" titles are going to be buggy. Stop complaining and don't get them if that's what you're going to put into each review of each pre-alpha that comes out.

It's definantly worth the twenty dollars to buy it. And at the very least, just watch reviews on YouTube. Watch out for updates and other things of that nature. Keep in touch, and follow this game. You don't have to buy it. But at least see what it's about by watching videos and reading reviews.\n\nRating: 7.5/10\n\nWould I buy it again assuming I didn't? Yes.\n\nIs it worth the twenty dollars?

They fixed the problem with sky bases being made, they made a new map, and they better optimized the game. Plus they have way more items. And if you people are thinking "Being a lone wolf is almost impossible!" I recommend not being a lone wolf. Myself on the other hand, am almost always a lone wolf, and I get along just fine and usually get a huge base going. So in the end, if you are not skilled in that field, don't ruin the game for others by saying how bad at it YOU are, just tell them how fun it could be for them.\n\nAnd for the lag, it is either: 1, you have to high of settings, 2, you are in a high ping server, or 3, have a crappy computer. And it is probobly the most fun building on hidden uneven terrain. I once made a large hole in the ground my base, and covered the top with dirt with stone under it incase of a raid, but never got raided. In fact, it is better building on uneven terrain because of how hidden you are, and how exposed the people on even terrain are. And main servers do not have a 20 player cap, they have a 40 player cap, and some community servers have a 60 player cap.\n\nAnd you are right, if you are saying there are a lot of abusive admins out there, because there ARE a lot of community servers that admins are abusive on, but there are also a lot of community servers where there are NOT abusive admins. If you don't want to be abused, don't join those servers. And it is very realistic that on a small island in the middle of the ocean, that there will be one king to rule them all (haha, get the reference?). If you don't like the king, raid him, and if he is too powerful, go around and collect taxes around the land, and if they try to fight you, you get to kill them and take there loot. And if you thing that taking 5 minutes to go get iron to make a sword with, or go for 5 mins to go get 200 flax from the flax field is too hard, then you are obviously not playing this game right.\n\nOver all I would rate this give a 9/10, because although this is such an amazing game, it will be better in the future. I hope my respond helped you rethink your review, or atleast, AT THE LEAST, helped you consider buying this game.","June 14, 2015","true","122.7"," 66 of 123 people (54%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","54","66","123","11","11"

It has everything shown in the trailer, and every single feature is a perfectly working. Crafting is simple. You gather wood, stone, metal, etc and make better crafting tables and other crafting items which are simillar to rust's crafting. Game play is absolutly fun, go and become king go around as a midget slaugheting people or just explore. The map is quite empty at the moment but with a large ammount of players there will be alot of raiding to do. With the chivalry-like combat system attacking people is quite fun when you have a small malitia to a large army. I do have to say, the game does not feel like a 20$ game, but it sure is fun. In its state, there are quite a few bugs. They are nothing agnoying  but they can happen at random times. One of the bugs that I found was me getting launched into the air (I think i might have met God) and splashing down into the water. The physics system is pretty good at its state right now. As I said before the flying bug is one of the only problems in the game. The character  customization feels alot like oblivin when you crate the strangest character. It is not that complicated and can edit your characters full body. You can be a averaged joe, or be a giant, or just be a little person. Reign Of Kings is a great game for anyone who just is a casual gammer or just wants to mess around with friends.\n\nI did forget to add that the community is great there are no screaming children, or people who just call you curse words.\n\n9/10","March 15, 2015","true","49.9"," 29 of 52 people (56%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","56","29","52","3","0"

It seems their intentions are no longer on developing and supporting game content.\nAt this point, the game feels like it's in a Beta state - movement, animations and character models are clunky and unrefined. The content available in the game feels shallow, and also in need of refinement. This is terribly unfortunate, because, despite the state of the game, there's plenty of fun to be had. If more time and effort had been put into the game's development, it would feel much fuller, vibrant and even more fun.\nWhat RoK offers now is a stable, albeit shallow and clunky, medieval sandbox survival experience. While it offers a fair amount of variety in resources, materials and crafting elements, it doesn't offer, or receive, the same developmental support that will ensure a lasting (fun and interesting) game experience. Furthermore, the combat, while serviceable and modestly entertaining, is in need of work; animations are horrible, and both armor and weapons could use balancing (to make the system more interesting, example being: the speed difference between fully nude and clad in full steel armor is roughly 6% - essentially, there's no pros, or cons, outside of armor value between armor sets).\nBut, again, RoK isn't a wholly bad game, and, in fact, it's pretty fun for the most part. It just feels unfinished. That's the best, tl:dr, way of describing the game: unfinished.\nI paid $5 for the game, on sale. At that price, it's worth the money. However, for the full $20, I just don't think I can recommend RoK. Ultimately, it's an unfinished product, that while fun, isn't worth the price of admission. If you can get it for $10, or less, then I say, "sure, go for it."\n\nAgain, TL:DR - Fun game, albeit feels unrefined and unfinished. Only worth it on sale, not at full-price.","February 13","false","92.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

No one can be trusted. Profanity and Hate is spewed from all spawn points with people in Iron or leather armor.

Although it's still in Early Access state, it is ABSOLUTELY playable!

The official servers are overwhelmingly packed but there are plenty of community servers and more show up everyday!\nThe games world rules are equivalent to what you would expect from a Hardcore PVP minecraft server.

Kind kings who give players guidance and have low taxes are usually supported by the playerbase of the server whereas most kings who come into power and raise the taxes to the roof are short lived when the furry of the whole server rallies up to get their vengence!

It lost its charm with the direction the devs took the game.... It saturated the servers with a gigantic map and more time wasted just seeking people to interact with. I don't want to be anti-social in a game that is supposed to be "survival" - that includes surviving other players.\n\nIn any case, the gameplay feels hindered, and the method of raiding has changed drastically. Everything shifted from being too easy toward being a waste of time. I just don't want to spend hours gathering materials and searching for people...\n\nI hope the reviews convince the devs to construct a better solution for problems rather than patching new content in and ignoring current issues.\n\nHopefully I made some persuasive points with this review, thanks!","December 28, 2015","false","146.9"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

Has it all, PvP, Building, RP and Survival. I've been holding off reviewing this game until I've had atleast 500 hours on it.\n\nIt's time to review.\n\nPros\n\n-Some of the funniest gaming experiences I've had have been on this game.\n\n-Building is fun and you can really creative with it, even better than the building system in minecraft.\n\n-PvP - Fast paced and very skill based.\n\n-Roleplaying - Even though I'm orientated towards PvP, Roleplay servers are an entirely differant experience in the game. Putting on a funny medieval voice and catching criminals as the medieval police was a very fun experience.\n\n-Character creation - I still chuckle at the bizzare and ugly character people come up with.\n\n-War time - The King and the guild system really add to the game, go to war with the king or with differant guilds.\n\nCons\n\n- Don't play this game alone - Whether you get irl friends, steam friends or make friends in game, it just makes the game so much more enjoyable than getting teamed on by yourself by 3 guys.\n\n- Official Server KOS and offline raiding - Although a lot of people like killing on sight and offline raiding, (i'm one of them) a lot of people get fustrated and leave after they die and lose their gear or somebody raids their home. If you're one of these people do not threat, you can still enjoy this game. There are COMMUNITY server with rules and admins who will ban anybody who breaks the rules. Find the right server for you.\n\n- Sieging - Sieging went from being completely overpowered to being completely underpowered. Codehatch are currently working on balancing so in time the siegeing system is a bit unbalanced and it may take a while to break into a base with a trebuchet.\n\nOverall I rate this game a solid 8/10 game. Some balancing issues are needed but overall I am very, very happy with my purchase.

You will spend a lot of time building things which is great, but there are so many hackers on every server that its pointless.

Hackers will just turn on your "flight mode" ? so while you are running you will fly into the floor by mistake and then they turn it off right after and you die. They do speed hacks where they run around really fast and break into your walls really fast.

My problem came with the core of this game on that first day, about my first two hours of game time where the combat experience was laggy and suffered from extremely slow framerates.\n\nSince then and about 20 hours of game time later..  I'm sold that this game is not only a two thumbs up, but the most fun, best multiplayer survival sandbox game out now.  It's incredibly fun, period.  Yes it has bugs and glitches and things that make you scratch your head like deer that run from you and fly through the air against logic and physics.  It doesn't matter.  This game is so much fun that it's easy to overlook these little problems and glitches that make no sense.\n\nGranted, I havent put all those hours in myself, as my son's best friend has been using my account to play with my son these past couple of days.  But both of them agree that this game is loads of fun after going on a five hour adventure in the game just this afternoon.\n\nI will be posting videos on this game soon, because covering everything fun and great about what these developers have created with this would make an insanely long wall of text that few would read.  Let's just say though that if you are an existing fan of similar games like Rust, Seven Days To Die, and the Forest, then you will probably love this game.  I have over 500 hours into Rust, and this game so far offers deeper gameplay, better graphics, and more fun then Rust.\n\nIt's not perfect, but it IS a helluva lot of fun, and these developers (who completely missed with StarForge) have both surprised and impressed me with RoK.  My biggest fear and reason to tell people to hold back is my fear that cheaters and hackers might take over and ruin this great game.  But it also might be a good reason to tell people to jump in NOW before that happens and experience all the fun it offers while it lasts.  Maybe the developers will continue to impress me and actually support and make this game even better and be able to control the cheaters and hackers.  {crosses my fingers}\n\nWith over 40 hours of game time in already between my son and I, this game has already been worth it's purchase price, and I suspect there are hundreds of hours to come.  The medeival style crafting in this game is already about 10 times that of what Rust 2.0 offers now, and we've only crafted about 15% of everything possible with all the hours we've already played.  ..Awesome.\n\nAny serious fans of Rust should not pass on this one right now.  For Rust fans particularly, this game is a definite and serious "MUST-BUY".  Wait, unless you are one of those weasel cheating, hack-using losers from Rust... then you should sat far, far away!  :-))\n\n\n-  Zaxx","March 11, 2015","true","75.4"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","63","10","16","3","0"

However after playing it for a total of 1 hour I was hooked and played it for 8 more hours on the first day.\n\nHowever information was being spread  about the company making the game. They botched on another game and people feel they were ripped of. Inspite of that for twenty dollars, I feel I have gotten my moneys worth easily. I've spent more on games that only have 20 hours of gameplay and very little replay value. However I'm well over 100 hours into this game and I still have not gotten bored.\n\nI do recommend finding a good online community to play with while the game is under development. For me that meant roleplay servers. The players are more friendly and are less likely to just break your stuff while you are asleep or kill you on sight. Plus interacting with other's characters is rather fun. At the time for local interaction VOIP is required. Otherwise there is a global chat for all and a global chat for your guild.\n\nThe game is perfect for anyone who loves the idea of playing around in a fantasy world and building their own great castles or even small homes.\n\nAs an alpha build, one thing to keep in mind is that servers do get completely wiped from time to time in order to fix issues. This can be discouraging but in a good community the players will work together to help rebuild before going to war with one another.\n\nI have recommended this game to all my friends and those who have purchased it have really enjoyed the game so far. I am looking forward to the future development of the game, but I will never feel that I was ripped off even if it doesn’t get much further than this.\n","March 26, 2015","true","343.2"," 14 of 24 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","14","24","0","0"

They add mod support and let people finish the game they failed to\n\n2. They actually start adding things again and talking to people on what needs to be fixed and added.\n\nOtherwise, this game in it's current state is pretty dull. I imagine it'll fade off by around the end of this year, maybe sooner. Guess it was fun while it lasted right?","February 27","false","306.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The building and PvP atmosphere was awesome & I was having an ♥♥♥ load of fun playing it. The game is absolutely unplayable right now on a public server.\n\nLast night I logged on, right after a server was wiped, and began establishing myself. I put in about 5 hours and had a very nice setup. A naked man wielding a club shows up and starts throwing spears at my base. Three of us run out to dispatch him, wearing Iron & Leather armor. We all have Iron weapons. This man proceeds to hit me and my friends, with a wooden club, from about 50 ft. away, never missing, & kills all three if us in seconds. He then enters our stone base, which is 100% blocked off with stone block and Iron gates, instantly and camps us. Shortly after, I go run around the corner of the mountain and this same guy has a giant T7 block base. He did this in 3 hours? I was logged on 2 hours b4 he was even on the server.\n\nI can not believe Code}{atch is just letting this game go to ♥♥♥♥. So many people enjoy it and they do literally nothing to combat hacking.  The game has so much potential, but their lack of effort has left it in an unplayable state. I wasted 5 hours of my time last night to rage quit. It is absolutely ridiculous that they have done nothing after all the input they have been given regarding this. Just read the rest of the comments and forums! I would not recommend this game to anyone until a solution is found.\n\nThank you Code}{atch for ruining what used to be one of my favorite games. Do you not care about your reputation? Or fans of your game? It would appear not.\n\n","March 2","false","409.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The game when fully fleshed out, has the potential imo to provide hours upon hours of fun akin to the type of experiences you would find in rust/dayz type communites albeit with less ♥♥♥♥ery. Thats not to say that this game has some flaws (which are to be expected in alpha) so for the sake of lists and lists alone (You know you like pros and cons bullet points in our reviews, you know you do!) I shall provide a brief list of Pros and Cons from MY perspective.\n\nPROS\n-Best Character Creation menu EVER!!! (I would seriously pay 5 bucks for a dlc that let me use the same system in this game on ANY game with character creation. Now the reason why I like it is very polarizing but I'll just state it simply; You can make your guy look ♥♥♥♥ing wierd beyond imagination. Remember 2K15's Face Scan Glitch? Picture that but the WHOLE body is your playground, if you haven't seen pictures of what Im talking about just google it and thank me later)\n-SUPER SMALL DL for how much stuff is already in the game, when I first dl'ed it was under 1gb (its more or exactly 1gb due to patches last time i checked)\n-Fairly Responsive Dev Team (Had one night where we saw 2 patches within a few hours of each other, they were extremly similar in what they fixed but it still shows they are earnest in their attempts to find all the kinks and what not)\n-Potential for an awesome RP experience (I suggest private or whitelisted servers, public servers it is nigh impossible to engage in rp or lite rp without sustaining small to severe raids up to having your whole base, blocks and all taken)\n-Potential for awesome PVP (Right now the game consists of several classes of swords axes warhammers bows crossbows javelins and varies other trinkets to maim and dismember your prey whether youre going for the kill or just to break his legs so you can rope him up easily and take him to your happy shack, and yes you will make a happy shack as I like to call it this game, filled with all the torture devices you can need for catching a leatherclad theif nicking your ♥♥♥♥. Also you can parry and feint and use 3 different types of strike for each melee weapon. SOMEWHAT similar to M&B or Chivalry)\n-Potential for amazing buildings (Has no upper limit to building as far as I know, built a tower on one server so high we timed it at 33 seconds to impact when jumping from the top. You can on rp servers mostly, build large complex towns through proper coordination and what not.)\n-Fairly engaging soundtrack (The soundtrack is very similar at somepoints to Skyrim the only problem being it plays sporadically at what seems to be random intervals, sometimes I hear music every 30 mins, sometimes its 10, sometimes it 2 hours etc.)\n\nCONS\n-Public servers can become riddled with hackers and griefers and even community servers that are not password protected or require you to be whitelisted can fall prey to these jackasses.\n-Limited material and structures to build with. (7 Tiers of material to make your base out of ranging anywhere from thatch,wood, reinforced iron, and stone being the highest tier currently. Also unless you rotate stairs or ramps there is no way to round out structures without resorting to the previous mentioned method, which is time consuming and often fatal if you are building high up. The game has half a dozen or so different lights, lanterns, lamps, candles, and torches to choose from when lighting up your humble viking raiding camp or peaceful cooking village. There are a handful of crafting stations each with there own set of upgrades that can produce anything from crests to claim land, steel armor for your warriors to defend their holy god emperor king lord, all manner of weapons, lockpicks, ropes, shackles, whips, trebuchets etc. The torture stations they have in the game are fairly limited so far but extremley rewarding when you do manage to throw someone in one, they consist of fun toys like guillotines, pillorys, gallows etc. There is A LOT of stuff for such a small DL and for an early release as well so I won't list them all.)\n-Unbalanced PVP (Right now most servers consist of midget fetus monsters with t rex arms running around with weapons twice the size of them kneecapping everyone of normal stature and just being an all around menace because, although the headshots are easier to score on these berserker offspring of the midget king napoleon, thats ONLY if you can hit the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. Not to mention hitboxes are horrible in this game compounded with lag and the to be expected bugs from alpha makes most matches a toss up, even if you're decked out in steel you can find yourself beaten to death and dismemberd by man in a thong wielding a deer leg.)\n-Server rollbacks/crashes can set your charcter back 2 mins or a few hours, I've had friends say it set them back by a full day but I cannot confirm that)\n-Game in its current state can become somewhat repetitive without engaging PVP/RP (After 50 hours in and being the king on a server where we built a nigh impenetrable gate, I found myself envying the peasants me and my men tortured and harassed for so long, manually collecting taxes or leading werewolfs or bears into their open houses, making them fight in death pits etc, because I was trapped in this iron fortress which is really just a giant guy made of stone who appears to be knighting another giant guy made of stone, while the wretched little curs were free to roam the countryside picking flax and flowers or blowing obnoxiously on their wretched horns or flutes, I had to always be on my guard leaving my fortress for as King you were always a target. So I switched servers and started and savage camp with my friends where we only wore wooden armor and used javelins and bows and shouted incomprehensible phrases at passerby before savagely...well savaging them. I suggest whenever you're feeling tired with the game to switch servers or just rebuild your base under a theme like "vikings, or traveling merchants, or slavers" whatever! just to keep you in the game until the devs start pumping out the really good stuff\n-The land is extremly small, to run from one end to the other takes about 7 mins so if you're coming from jogging simulator I mean DayZ then you might be put off or find this to your liking, hopefully they expand and add more stactic objects and possibly NPCS to interact with. Maybe a safe zone to do trading who knows.)\nTL;DR\nThis game has the potential to thrust itself firmly into the upper echelons of survival base building type games, but that all depends on the devs and their ability to push out fun and challenging new content and get rid of the hackers while also allowing a way for players to moderately their own communities without need of an Admin on 24/7. They also need to desperately update the admin panel because as it stands right now with explosive kegs being disabled, admin have no reliable way of removing objects or blocks placed down to grief someone other then using a trebuchet like a normal player. With all that being said this purchase should give you a few hundred hours if you're into medievel ♥♥♥♥, torture, slavery, and base building survival genres.","March 24, 2015","true","340.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

The game is too time consuming for the little entertainment it provides.

If you're not in an international clan where people in your clan play all throughout the day, everyday, it's not worth your time.

I started on a server with a low amount of players and some became addicted to the game. Bashing trees, building towers, killing animals ( I said I'd take revenge you stupid bear! ), some pvp from time to time and even starting a guild.\n\nIn the early alpha it was pretty easy to go from noob to hero, I didnt mind that at all since everytime you go offline for longer then 3 days you've got to pretty much restart and re-do everything. I had a great time and had a little guild with some new friends I made. But the fun decreased every update, restarting from the bottom became harder and harder until it was nearly impossible to get starting on your own. This game is fun, but the amount of time it takes to start and get into the fun stuff takes too long and everytime you get close someone will beat you up and make you have to restart all over again. But this isnt the only bad thing, there are tons of little glitches, sometimes they even kill you!!\nThe PvP is very very laggy, its so laggy that its not skill based whenever you win, nope its based on the amount of lagg and luck you get.\n\nI honestly was looking forward to play this game, but after all these things,\nI'm not enjoying the game anymore.\nToo bad it had to end like this.","December 12, 2015","false","126.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

But let me just say that I LOVE survival games. I play 7 Days to Die and Space Engineers pretty much exclusively so I know what I'm talking about when I say this game is just freakin awful.\n\nHere are my main problems with the game (compared to other survival games I enjoy past and present):\n\nThe UI is hideous, the game is buggy, the servers are full of angry 12 year olds, the graphics are nasty, the controls are clunky, the armor might as well be made of paper, the enemies are over powered, player movement speed is super slow, you can get roped by a naked guy and hauled off to stocks and there is NOTHING YOU CAN DO!\n\nRead on for review and updates...\n\n\n\n\n<August Update>\n\nNew update, Thought I'd try again. Still awful. In fact worse. A naked guy was able to grab me with a rope from real far away and haul me for ages while I could do nothing. He put me in stocks and axed me to death. I respawned, tried to find him and got teleported back to the same stocks some how. I could swing my club but not access my inventory. Only option was to exit game... What a pile of ♥♥♥♥ this game is.\n\n11/10 would get murdered by an angry 12 year old again\n\n<End of August Update>\n\n\n\n\n<July Update>\n\nAnother month gone by, and it seems like nothing has changed. I can't believe this piece of junk even exists! It was gifted to me by a friend but I still feel robbed...\n\n<End of July Update>\n\n\n\n\n<June Update>\n\nUpdated review to reflect recent updates. It's still bad and the fact there nearly every update (usually weekly) means a server reset and losing everything you've worked on really annoys me.\n\nBuggy, bad graphics, horrible community. The only "good" thing about this game is the concept. It's executed extremely poorly.\n\nWait for full release and it MIGHT be stable enough to play and enjoy.\n\n<End of June Update>\n\n\n\n\n<Original review May 2015>\n\nI wish I kept my original review... Went into great detail about the bugs.

The UI shares a lot in common with that other game, and the general resource gathering aspect will feel very familiar to those that have played both.\n\nBut that is where the comparison ends.\n\nI was hesitant to jump in on this one as I had played both flavors of that other game, and a few others games like it, and was expecting the same general type of community.  I'm not going to lie, yes, you'll encounter a few of those folks here as well, but the sheer scope of this game and the community at large, to me, more than makes up for any aspects of PVP that may have you not wanting to jump in on this one.\n\nBuilding crafting is a free formed "cubed" based with multiple material types and a is a tiered progression tied to your crafting equipment (workstations).  As you improve those workstations, you gain access to better stuff to make, very straight forward and simple to get started in.\n\nEarly game is about survival, mid-to-later game play is fortifying, and all of it builds up to trying to take (or defend) the crown for the kingdom.\n\nWhile yes, you'll run into those folks who simply want to watch the world burn, you'll also encounter those who want to achieve something more, and this game allows both to reside mostly side-by-side, while allowing you the convenience to play (mostly) how you like.\n\nJust keep in mind, at its heart, this is a PVP game that is really focused on the group vs. group mechanics, and there is no solo player mode without hosting your own private server.  So you can play solo if you really want, but you're honestly missing out on more than 50% of the game doing so.","March 23, 2015","true","23.8"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","0"

I joined a couple of Community servers to start out, and every time would gather/harvest peacefully for 30m or so.

The ability to free-build a castle and risk losing it all provides hours of fun. This fun has been RUINED by an influx of Chinese players who lag, exploit, and hack the North American official servers day and night, driving the legitimate players away.\n\nCodeHatch have failed to acknowledge this as even a problem and CHOOSE to develop the game in ways that it doesn't need right now. They chose to spend almost a month designing shields instead of pouring all their resources into releasing a working ping-limiter and auto-kicker system to get rid of these lagging and cheating Asian players. The game actually is more broken with this latest Patch 18 than it was weeks ago. CodeHatch continuously claims that the ping-limiter is not quite ready yet and delays its release every passing update. 99% of their community forums are actual LEGIT players begging for them to fix this...yet they can't/won't do it.\n\nDON'T get sucked in by the 50% off - Let them earn players by releasing content that helps the game.","August 5, 2015","false","327.7"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","9","15","0","0"

The combat is not great, it needs major improvements. The combat does not feel like anything from chivalry, there is a lot of lag and little combat. Currently right now simply sprinting into some can kill them... On servers with low ping I still see a lot of dsync happen. Players are not where they are on others screens and doors are open for one but closed for another. Also this games runs poorly on a lot of the official servers, once you start building a base your frames will drop, my guild had an average of 15 fps inside our base. Not only does building drop your frames but some servers just can't handle the load of people and the fps drops everywhere.

Although I am usually against purchasing Early Access games, I couldn't resist this one. The crafting is incredibly in depth and you can most definitely survive as a new spawn quite easily. Character customization is hilarious considering what you can do you them (i.e huge jacked legs w/ T-rex arms).\n\nMy one issue with this game is that it was made by the same people who kickstarted their first game "Starforge" on IndieGoGo quite a few years ago. They've pretty much abandoned that game and are "officially releasing" it soon dispite it clearly not being done. I did however contact them regarding this concern and they offered to refund the initial purchase of Starforge (although I declined) and gave me an extra RoK key.\n\nPersonally, this game is worth the purchase despite it being Early Access. They are updating the game regularly, server stability improves weekly, and the game is genuinely a fun time. To rap it up here's the review:\n\nPROS:\n\n- Character Customization usually results in tons of laughs\n- In depth crating system\n- Progession does not feel forced or grindy\n- Customer service/ Support are very cooperative when voicing concern with their previous game\n\nCONS:\n\n- Made by the same people who never finished their IndieGoGo campaign "StarForge"\n- Hackers are rampant\n- No incentive to not KoS\n- Server Stability is terrible right now","March 24, 2015","true","48.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Buy Reign of Kings.\n\nThis tire-fire of a game is truly one of the most horrific, poorly thought out, ill conceived, astonishingly poorly executed games on steam. My buddies convinced me to buy this game when it first came out as alpha. Since survival games were the rage of 2015, and having had some fun with others, I felt I'd give it a try (Day Z, H1Z1 -- which are not even close to great games, but at least were fun for a bit).\n\nLiterally would have enjoyed burning a 20 dollar bill in my hand. I know that is usually a hyperbolic statement, but, seriously, that would have been more enjoyable than giving a cent to this game and its creators.\n\nFrom the beggining:\n-The worst hit boxes in any video game I have ever played. Ever. Spears stick out of enemies feet from their bodies, but if you swing a club at an enemy and it visible goes through them, guess what? You missed. Learning this defunct combat system is akin to learning sandskrit.... blindfolded.\n\n-If you like a gaming community rife with hackers, this is your game. The amount of hacking ingame makes H1Z1's hacking woahs seem like childsplay. Seriously, your base will be hacked by time you finish heating up that Hot-Pocket.\n\n-The doors. Oh, for the love of God, the doors. I @#$% you not, the doors, when closing them, will pull you back into your structure and lock you inside. It is a @$#%^%^@# artform to close those doors. If the secret to immortality and infinite wealth was behind a reign of kings door, you'd die young and poor.\n\n-Even if your base isn't hacked, don't worry, they are unimagineably easy to break into and have everything stolen from them. But let's be real, it was likely just hacked.\n\n-Did I mention the combat? Oh, I did? It is so @#$%@!% terrible it needs a second mention how bad it is.\n\nLAST BUT NOT LEAST:\nI tried loading this game to see if this s!@# storm of a game had any improvements made on it. As if I could salvage the 29.4 hours i wasted on this game, and maybe get some value.\n\nNope.\n\nBlue Screened my computer upon load.\n\nDo Not Buy Reign of Kings. I promise. I guarantee. I ensure. You will regret it.\n\n","December 9, 2015","false","29.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I love high fantasy games but this one is a disappointment even with my positively biased views for Medieval games. The servers and connection between player and server is a huge problem. I had even tried it with 4 Mbps connection and I had a ping of around abouts 500. Not only that but if there is only just a single person on the server with you, lag jumps through the roof and will most often end up just logging you saying no connection to server. Now as for game mechanics, I would absolutely love to write a review for that however all my time in this game has been trying to at least get on a server without having a ♥♥♥♥ connection. I wish I could have a refund however the time limit expired months ago.

The biggest being the consistent cheating / hacking / exploiting regardless of how many attempts the DEVS made to try and reduce it. The only way to play this game is on a dedicated server with a consistant population and "good" admin team. Although even then, the bulk of the private servers were filled with countless abusive admins. Just another feather in the cap that helped break this game to virtually zero. That's why the mass majority of us went to other and much more better survival style games such as ARK and 7DtD.\n\nYou can look over the RoK forums and see for yourself how there's pratically zero activity for months barring a handful of new posts with zero to a few responses. Combine that with very little active DEV support and you have the perfect recipe for a slum game. Many will find this review "funny" but the numbers and forums don't lie.\n\nGo get 7DtD and find a good modded server (many out there) or get some fun with ARK.

But I can't. It has a lot of great features that i'm not even going to cover because there is no point in doing so. It's another crafting game that puts way too much emphasis on focusing people into a PvP situation. Want to build a base that looks like awsome fortress? Ok. Go ahead and pour hours into this game trying to do so and you will be rewarded with defeat in the end. Whether your structures are big or small someone will want to break it, and this usually will happen while you are logged out and your character is asleep with gear on its person in said base. Oh that's right, you log out and your avatar will be lying there waiting for someone to just beat it into a bloody mess and take all your gear. This game has no system in place to reward players for friendly play and it is eventually in the end causing players to kill each other for reasons such as "I'm bored, and you were there.". Recently hackers have been making the game even more difficult with Fly Mode, Speed Hacks, Invisibility, and Duping Monsters in mass just to name a few. The developer made some headway against this with one good update, but as of the day I typed this up I saw these hacks being used in game again with no penalty to the user. I am going to say that I am probably one negative comment in a sea of positives, and I will say check out other comments on this game before making your decision to play this game. But my experience of this game has been mostly negative and I cannot currently recommend it.","April 2, 2015","false","113.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Its so bad its good, like those crappy B-Rated horror movies like Sharknado that people will go out of their way to watch with a group of friends. I've dicked around quite a bit in this game and have had a massive amount of fun playing the jenky-game with my friends. The early access glitchy-ness was appealing. But, I'm going to rate this negitively because of one key aspect:\n\nThis is it. The game is finished as it is.\n\nI supported this game until Code}{atch, the developer, once again abandoned a project mid-way through. I bought this in beta a while back, expecting a lot more to come of the game. A friend of mine made a brilliant point "I couldn't tell if this was a glitch or a feature of the game" and that essentially describes a lot of the poor mechanics of the gameplay. This wouldn't be a problem but the developer decided that, one day, it was time to release the game in full! So this is it. This is the entire game in all of its (glory?). I wouldn't reccomend it. Its on sale for $4.99 and it isn't even worth that much content-wise. There's NOTHING in this game. Its in dire need of being updated and unfortunately it just won't really happen at this point.\n\nNot to mention the fact that they didn't even incorperate region-locking for the online servers, so there are massive amounts of vigilante chinese-hackers ruining servers so average players like me can't function properly and play the game the way its supposed to be played. I hade to make my own game out of it and create different goals aside from the main goal. At least it supports creativity, I guess... I'm pretty decent at the game, but I'm just sick of going on a North American server and seeing invincible chinese players spamming chinese characters in the chat that I can't read. Its sloppy and region locking should be incorperated in every game.","January 1","false","50.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

The overall execution of the game is terrible, I recently came back from months of not playing after they stopped adding features to the game, in the hopes that the optimization of the game would have improved. Sadly however, I returned to the same old unfinished game, the game that let me down from such a promising start. The lag on official and community servers is unbearable in combat. On community servers, PvP usually lags when a lot of people are online, which is supposed to be a time when the game is most exciting. The game is overall, pretty terrible, and the company should honestly stop making games until they learn what finishing and perfecting a game actually means.","February 27","false","542.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The game has very bad issues that cause constant server lag as well as constant teleporting issues where you someone will disapear and just reapear somwhere in that area. Since there are heavy lag issues server counts are usally small.\n2. The updates come few and far apart with very little changes.\n3. Poor optimization and play ability. Even tho the game is not graphicly intensive it runs poorly on all machines.\n4. Hitboxes are poorly defined. Manytimes you will go into an engagement and loose not because lack of skill but lack of solid pvp mechanics.\n5. The devs have a negative veiw in the public.\n\n-Pros-\n1. You like Medieval games.\n2. You like building.\n3. Decent sound track.(some songs/themes are really good.)\n4. The maps are not too large and not to small.\n5. The game has allot of potential.\n\n-Conclusion-\nReign Of Kings (RoK) is a good concept lacking proper execution.\nIt does have allot of potential that I hope will one day be realized.\nWhat is there doesnt justify the costs tho.\nI fear without proper direction and changes\nthis game is going to fall short of community expectations.\n\n-Warning-\nI suggest all people throughly withold purchasing an early acess title until they have done research on the devs and there team working on a game at the bare minimum. Too many people are supporting bad business practices.","May 4","false","6.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/prometheustsn/recommended/344760/","prometheustsn","Prometheus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/prometheustsn/","20 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nFirst of all, thank you for building up such an entertaining and great game.\n\nAs a gamer the most important aspect of a game is "playability" and if it has this, it will have a long-lasting play time.\n\nThe good things about the game are, it has lots of things similar to our life. There are lots of stuff and things to make. Building part is really nice since it provides the player a wide range of materials and creativity. The voice and mic thing is really nice for Role Playing.\n\nHowever, there are too many parts in game to be improved for stable playability. For instance, at first, it is not so much important to have so much items and so much graphics. In alpha version, the game could be more suitable for older computers (which I have one right now) so that more players can join and test the game without lagging and "paralyzed-screens", and freezings etc. What I mean is that the game MUST be fluent to play. This is the most important thing for many gamers. The graphics can be altered and improved later on.\n\nSecondly, the very first thing to improve is to OPTIMIZE the game engine as soon as possible. There must be more graphical options (Medium textures i.e.). Additionally the game takes too much RAM to run, so this must be, again, fixed at the very beginnig.\n\nI also played ROK in a more advanced computer (My brother's computer and he also has the game) but the problems are nearly the same.\n\nTo conclude, the game engine MUST be optimized so that the game can run on most of the computers (even in the older ones). This will make your game suitable for the top numbers (players). And there can be more options in character creation screen. But this is not so necessary for now.\n\nI think this game will start a new era for "free-world type" games and when those improvements above are done, it will reach a wide number of players around the world. In my country, Turkey, I heard about the same complaints from many players. So your team should focus on the optimization.\n\nIn the future if any help needed for "Localization" ( I mean if you need Turkish Language option) I gladly help you with this.\n\nLooking forward to see most of the problems solved in BETA!\n\nLATEST NOTE: The game is open for hacking. So this MUST be fixed at very first so that players do not leave the game FOREVER.\n\nRegards","November 2, 2015","true","245.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Feels like it needs more balancing, more stuff, and more... thought.
