But when a game is this terrible, I can't risk missing the refund window.\n\nSaw it had just released, thought I would give it a shot since there were no reviews at the time.\n\nPlayed for about 15 minutes. I'll go into detail about my verdict, but I have just one general point to state:\n\nThis game is garbage.\n\nFrom the very beginning of the game, I realized time and time again that the interface would be unintuitive and unresponsive. The menus do not often respond to inputs, the controls make very little sense, and often times you can't cycle backwards through various menus while looking at your options. In crafting menus, there are times when the game will not allow you to move backwards through the menu- you either have to craft what you've selected (regardless if you want to), or exit the menu entirely and start all over (assuming the game will even let you).\n\nThe visuals of the game are lazy and frequently reused. There are no voxels in this game, it is merely a visual style. There is no destructable nor buildable terrain, and maps are just flat squares populated with boring, repetitive trees, rocks and placeholder monster representations. The game is completely unoptimized- Running on the game's "Fastest" setting, my GTX 970 cannot seem to render the field without stuttering every few seconds. The problem is compounded when standing within a tile of water.\n\nIf asked to describe the combat system of the game in one word, there is only one word I can think of to fit it: Lousy. It is turned based in the traditional JRPG style of NES and PSX games, which isn't a bad thing. The problem is, the system is implemented SO POORLY.\n\nYou are forced to undergo a quick-time event every time you attack, and the accuracy is crucial to landing the strike. Perfect timing will result in a critical hit, and if you're close to perfect you'll get a weak hit. Unfortunately, the window for perfect timing is almost impossibly small, and the margin for error to even land a weaker hit is also unforgiving. There were times that I swore I'd nailed the QTE, yet the game still called the attack a miss.\n\n-Further elaborating on the combat, the controls are abyssmal. You select action options on a wheel via use of bumper buttons (By now you will have given up on using a mouse and keyboard, the game simply refuses to cooperate with those) and press "A" (or whatever button decides to work as the designated select button at that time). It is almost impossible to change your mind after selecting an option: Once, while looking through the "items" options, I decided to attack instead- the interface would not allow me to do anything but use a potion. I tried pressing every button on my controller and even a few common-sense keys on the keyboard. None of it worked. Forced to chug.\n\nI don't know if it's the same later on as you level up, but early game you are forced to "Rest" between attacks (OH. Your basic attacks cost Stamina, by the way. And a lot of it), forcing you to spend one turn resting to regain stamina for every turn you attack. Fortunately, the enemies are also forced to rest. This makes for boring, repetitive and time consuming battles that are almost meaningless.\n\nOverall, the quality of this game is something you should expect from a free alpha demo from a single-person studio, not a full release. This game is not worth a dime.\n\nDo not buy 3DRPG. I beg of you. Do not buy this trash.","January 12","false","0.3"," 631 of 917 people (69%) found this review helpful 55 people found this review funny","69","631","917","55","60"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Azure_Fang/recommended/431840/","Azure_Fang","Azure Fang","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Azure_Fang/","1396 products in account","I bought this game specifically because of Rusinylancer's negative review, and I am glad that I did so. While lacking polish, this game is surprisingly fun. If you just want the bullet list, scroll down to "Final Say", as this will be TL;DR for many.\n\nControls\nControl of this game is intended for controller, and controller is active by default. If you plan to use a keyboard, make sure to set controls in the pre-game setup menu, and go over them so  that you may become familiar. Once in game, navigate to "options" and set the control type to "keyboard" so that you have proper control of the game. Beyond this, still expect some odd control choices, such as a second confirm button when crafting.\n\nGameplay\nBe warned: There is no tutorial in this game. You will have to learn everything yourself.\n\nGameplay is broken in to two distinct modes: map and exploration. In map mode, you travel the overworld square by square, consuming food to move or perform actions such as adventuring or mining; exploring the map can also trigger events, which can lead to treasure, events, or combat.\n\nExploration encompasses hunting and gathering food, adventuring for treasure, and exploring towns. When entering an explorable, the zone is randomly generated, giving constant play even in a single playthrough. Monster kills and treasure finds generate resources that can be used to craft equipment, while hunting/gathering/fishing provides food necessary to perform exploration actions.\n\nAs noted in the game description, all NPCs in towns are recruitable - simply talk to an NPC and, if you meet their requirement, you can add them to your party to be used in combat and crafting actions.\n\nCharacter development follows two systems: level and skill. As you kill enemies, you gain experience, rising in level and gaining HP ans SP, as well as progressing "killer" tracks for enemy types. By using skills, everything from your attack skill to crafting skills, they rise in effectiveness over time, much in the way of adaptive level games such as the original Dungeon Siege.\n\nCombat follows the semi-standard "line formation" style. Your party and the enemy are on opposite sides of the field and take turns, based on stats, performing actions. Attacking an enemy in combat uses a quicktime event, requiring input when a target passes in a reticle to perform a successful hit. All attacks take SP, which are regenerated in combat using the "rest" command, artificially slowing combat both on your side and on the enemy's side. After a successful battle, experience and loot is awarded, monster log entries are updated, HP/SP are restored, and the game continues.\n\nA playthrough consists of selecting your appearance, class, stats, and main task, with "find someone to take the place of your soul" and "get revenge on your killer" being the initial unlocked tasks, then running the game. The goal of a playthrough is to complete your main task to win the game, but gameplay is otherwise freeform.\n\nOverall, gameplay is fun, if a grind, but the quicktime events and artificial stretching of combat requiring rest produce a dull, "do I have to go through this again?" break from the game.\n\nGraphics\nLet me clear the air in light of Rusinylancer's review. Voxel[en.wikipedia.org] =/= Buildable or destructible. Voxel graphics are exactly as you see in this game: objects in game are comprised of "3D pixels" - filled cubes - rather than shaped polygons. The misconception that voxel games are solely sandbox or destructible builders can be attributed to the fact that the style is used in an abundance of such games, most notoriously Minecraft (though this itself is a misconception) or Steam-distributed games such as Trove or 7 Days to Die, while it's use in terrain and objects can be dated back to Amok on Sega Saturn in 1996 but likely goes back even further.\n\nBy using small voxels to render objects, in much the same way as PlayStation 3 game 3D Dot Game Heroes, with which this game shares MANY similarities, the game produces a "neo-retro" feel, being both 3D yet pixelated at the same time. While the voxel usage produces uncommon, pleasing visuals, this is weakened by a pervasive blur effect on even close objects, a camera locked to 90 degree angle turns at a non-adjustable plane, and opaque zone walls that obstruct the camera when too close to the screen-side wall of a given zone.\n\nPolish\nTo an extent, the game feels a little "cranked out". Text bleeds over some menu boundaries, graphics could use a second opinion on some design choices, mouse cursor follows keyboard/controller choices in many cases leaving it hanging on the screen when not in use, menu cursor that remains on the same "row" when flowing through cascading menus, combat is artificially lengthened, and no tutorial explaining any mechanics in the game whatsoever. Needs a lot of polish.\n\nFinal Say\nNicely rendered voxel graphics hampered by pooor usage of blur\nArtificially lengthened combat\nRandomly generated gameplay giving long single- and multiple-playthrough lifetime\nFreeform party with any randomly generated NPC available as a member\nNo tutorial and no explanation of gameplay elements\nSolid, if basic, crafting system\nNeeds a lot of polish\nNo starting explanation of how to beat a playthrough short of the one line description\nThe game is enjoyable, if bland. If you like randomly generated RPGs there are worse games you could by with your money, but definitely weigh other game options when looking at this one. It is definitely enjoyable, but could easily turn a buyer off based on opinion. Remember that Steam has a return system for a reason!\n\nOverall, this deserves a recommendation, on the auspices that it may receive improvements over time.","January 13","true","2.2"," 75 of 94 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","75","94","2","0"

I am hard pressed to find games with this particular art style that don't lend to it's own tropes that seem to follow it around.  However, I did really enjoy 3D Dot Game Heroes on the PS3 (albeit I found frustratingly hard at times).  I'm also a huge fan of active/timed combat in a turn based environment ala JRPG.\n\nThis game hits all of those marks.\n\nPros:\n- tight, responsive and tactile controls\n- sharp, clean voxel graphics with that tilt-shift style lens filter\n- smart and active response turn based combat (at first, it's not, but the more you play, the more it evolves)\n- fun music with a little bit of a J-pop sound\n- exploration exploration exploration (go out, do things, discover what you'll do next)\n- randomly generated everything\n- the grind? (I love grinding)\n\nCons:\n- lack of story depth or quest options; I would like to see side quests available (fetch? kill count?)\n- mild tutorial without much introduction (I found it easy to find my way through the game, but without anyone to tell me things were going to get better...I assumed the worst)\n- not all controller keys/axis are configurable (can't adjust rotation to thumbstick, etc)\n- the grind?  (some people don't like grinding)\n\nI appreciate the subtle humor in the game, the art, and even the homage to all the games that came before it to make it what it is.  As the developer noted the game was inspired by 3DDGH, Breath of Fire, Legend of Dragoon, etc...and it really shows in all the good ways.","January 16","true","5.4"," 32 of 41 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","32","41","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/spazfrag/recommended/431840/","spazfrag","Spazfrag","http://steamcommunity.com/id/spazfrag/","5599 products in account","What starts of as an endearing cute styled RPG turns into a nightmare exercise in frustration due to poor design, poor controls, and a boring repetitive world.\n\nThis game feels like Early Access and should have been released as Early Access.   Right from the start you get a feel for the poor controls, the boring unresponsive combat and repetitive gameplay.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=600014931\n\nI won't go into details about the bugs, but this video will show a few.   But the bugs don't bother me, it's the core design of the game that does.\n\nFor a start, forget using a Keyboard.  Just forget it.  Although the controls are simple, they are poorly thought out and frustrating.    You use WASD keys to look around in Bow (hunting) mode, while to look left and right at 90 degree angles you press the Q and E key.   Why these aren't bound to mouse movement I don't know.\nUsing a controller isn't much better.   While walking around the square slab of the current flat boring map you use the left and right shoulder buttons to look left and right.   Again, why you can't use the controller's right stick I don't know.\n\nWhile walking around on a map in treasure mode you can initiate combat with a generic looking enemy which represents any enemy, and will become a random amount of actual enemies once combat has started.   We've all seen this before in older RPGs, but not everyone was a fan of it.\nThis is where the frustration really starts.   Every single attack is a simple QTE (Quick Time Event) where you have to push the button at the right time to make the attack make contact.  Every single attack, every time, a damned QTE.   What makes this really frustrating is that it rarely works properly, which results in a complete miss.  It seemed to miss more often with a controller.  Being turned based, every QTE attack (which is the standard attack), uses stamina.   Run out of stamina, and you need to manually select a "Defend" ability to pass your turn.\nEvery battle was the same thing.   Missed attack, Missed attack, run out of stamina, have one enemy kill your companion (who also missed attacks even though you SWEAR you got every one right) killed in two turns.   An escape or "Flee" option is available, but even that doesn't work correctly.   When I select it, it says "Already used today" even though I have never used it one single time in the entire game.\n\nThere's also crafting, cooking, fishing and mining, but none of it is ever explained to you.   The game basically just starts, plonks you into a town, and you'll find yourself just rubbing up against everything to see if you can interact with it. Is there a gate here?   How do I get out of here?   It took me a while to figure out that to even leave the town I had to press the EXIT button.  I saw it there but thought it would exit the game, not simply leave the "Dungeon" (town?)  Again, nothing is explained.\nIt's purely a game of experimentation to try and figure out what you can and should be doing while getting annoyed while doing it.   Same goes for the crafting, map modes (Treasure hunting/hunting for food), it's kind of just there, and assumes you already know everything.\n\nThis would be fine for an early access title, but this is not Early Access.   This is supposed to be the final product.\nIf you want to make the claim "Of course there's bugs, customers please help to fix the bugs so the bugs can be fixed", then release it as an EA title so people know what they are in for.    This doesn't feel finished at all.\n\n\n","January 14","false","5.0"," 28 of 43 people (65%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","65","28","43","2","0"

It's ready to live and die by that voxel art style so much that its encompassed as generic name as it could. 3DRPG what's it about? Its about 3D and RPG! It may look like another game with the same art style, but rather than playing like an adventure with real time combat and puzzles,  3DRPG is a traditional role playing game played out on a flat surface with turn based battles. If you are expecting a game where you build things with mini cubes or fight against enemies in real time, avoid this game. Everything that may look like a real time battle is just a different camera angle during combat.\n\nWhen the game begins, its revealed that you're a lost soul, an imp on its way to damnation until you remember your name and who you are. By this I mean make your character. Give yourself hair, an eye color, shirt color, gender and so on. Then you pick a class, a weapon and assign your stats. Once you make your character, you're given the choice of a plot in order to stay out of the infernal pits. From the start there are two plots unlocked which are kill someone or get someone to take your place. The game seems to play out the same with either selection.\n\nFrom there, the game is devoid of story, plot or quests. You're just plopped down in a generated town in a random generated world. Townspeople give you hints on how to play and if asked for directions, they tell you where your destination is such as a town to the northeast, but never reference names or quests. You can also ask any towns person to join your party with a starting limit of two. In town you can buy weapons, armor and items. If you leave town and return, a new town map is generated for you.\n\nYour player can move in 360 degrees, but the camera is limited to four directions: north, south, east and west. You can go into a first person aim mode that lets you look any which way, but takes away your ability to walk.\n\nOutside of town, is a world map where you move square to square in a cumbersome fashion. Normal games would let you move left and right, just keep moving. This game is a square by square basis. First you chose right, then move, then a selection pops up if you'd like to hunt for food, go treasure hunting or mining depending what type of terrain you're on. Each move on the map costs food depending on the terrain. Treasure hunting and mining cost food as well.\n\nHunting for food, costs no food. Here you're just dumped into a random map and given a bow and a fishing pole. You can either go fishing in a river or hunt down animals with a cumbersome control scheme where you take on a first person view and then rotate your way around to shoot bunnies, chickens and other things. When you're in first person view with a bow, you can only turn and aim. There's no way to walk forward. Other than killing things for food, you can find random plants to eat that are hovering above the surface.\n\nSearching for treasure is awful because its this giant, empty flat surface of a three dimensional map that has you looking for three small boxes. So its a three dimensional game with flat maps that have a rock formation here or there. It becomes quite an unenviable chore to scour an uninteresting flat surface for more than five minutes. Where are the real dungeons and environments? The towns manage to have buildings and trees, but the random generation just lacks something that was designed to be fun.\n\nI managed a few times to get stuck after walking over water, beyond town fences and getting wedged between a rock and a tree. The game lets you exit a map at any time and back to the world map.\n\nScavenging the land, killing things and so on will reward you with leather, gold, wood and food. With these items you can craft them into weapons, armor and potions. You can cook raw food into edible food. All crafting recopies are laid out easy. There's no guess work, just a system of menus. Select the type of thing you want to create between weapon, armor and item, select what you want to make and then what you want to make it out of. You see everything, there is no guesswork. The menu itself could be smoother.\n\nUnlike hunting, when you're searching for treasure you'll see slimes on the map. Touching a slime sends you into combat! However, battles can occur at random, but they are rare. You can also be ambushed with a battle on the world map as well.\n\nCombat is turn based like most other role playing games. There is a twist though, because your attacks are timing based. One square pops up on screen while another square moves toward the first. When they meet up you need to push a button to determine if you hit or miss. I managed to glitch the game where after a few battles, the prompt would never show up. When the squares were about to touch, it would just register as a miss with no opportunity to allow me to attack.\n\nEach attack used costs action points. So attacking is an action. Once you run low, you'll need to defend or standby which replenishes your action points. The game only allows you to flee one battle per day, but once I fled one battle the game never let me flee again. That's an issue that can be sorted out.\n\nThe combat is just dull and shallow reliant on tedium of a mini game that makes you push a button. This makes every battle tiresome because there are other timing mini games that are more engaging than 3DRPG, but from a role playing game. I want combat to be a deeper game of chess.\n\nYou get to see the enemy health and skill points along with who is ready to attack. Its a good system that shows you everything, but the big issue is how awkward the fight menu is and that sums up the game as a whole. To select an attack, its up or down on the directional pad. To cycle through attack, flee and item its the bumpers on the controller. Once you've selected an attack, chose who to use it on by using the left and right arrows. It feels so alien. Controlling the camera with the bumpers also feels so alien too. Maybe this game was designed for a Super Nintendo controller with modern technology.\n\nI should also point out this game's minimum requirements are above Skyrim's requirements. That seems crazy for a game that's under 500 MB. I'm also curious what this game would get for an age rating considering there's a lot of blood when enemies die.\n\nAfter the pummeling I've given to this game, I'd like to see something better with the art style. It just feels so hollow. You need to want to play it, but it does nothing to make me want to play it. There's no story, no quests, you just keep finding your own entertainment and when a game makes me find my own entertainment, that opens me up to the idea that other games are more entertaining than this.","January 23","false","1.7"," 17 of 25 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","17","25","0","0"

Exploration, great battle system, crafting, resource gathering, multiple class/profession options... to me, this is everything Minecraft is missing. Sure, it may not have building, but that is pretty small potatoes compared to the rest of the game.\n\nSo far, my biggest complaint is a lack of save system. However, that complaint is present in any game that implements only auto-saving.\n\nRPG fans shuld definitely give this game a shot!","January 23","true","9.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BrahminRamen/recommended/431840/","BrahminRamen","Nop","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BrahminRamen/","1404 products in account","15 minutes was enough to see this game wasn't for me.\n\nI do enjoy the art style, but the game just completely failed to keep my attention past a few minutes. Everything in the world seemed bland and pointless. You start off on a world map and select one of four tiles around you. You can look for food, look for treasure (find the 4 or so treasure chests and open them), look for a mine, or select another 4 tiles to travel to and repeat. That's not fun to me and it sure as heck didn't make me go "Ooh, I wonder what comes next!" or "Ooh, I want to better my character by <blank>!".\n\nThe second thing that put me off about this game were the controls. Why lock a 3d game to four fixed viewing directions (north, south, east, west) when the game was designed for a modern controller with two analog sticks? I did get into a battle, which *looked* like a standard JRPG battle, but it just wasn't. Somehow the controls were also poor during the battle scenes as well and on top of that you must pass a quicktime even to actually land an attack, for every attack. This can be seen in the trailer around the 50s mark.\n\nNeat graphics and it looked promising, but it has bad controls and, most importantly, no hook.","June 1","false","0.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

And In my opinion once you actually get into the game and play around with the whole crafting system,hunting system,fighting system and treasure finding system, i'm sure you will come to realize that this game isn't as bad as you think it is. If you only give this game little under an hour, you aren't fully experiencing what this game has to offer... I've played a little over 2 hours and have gotten really into the game due to how fun/funny some moments can be in this game, for one you have to collect a party, and to do things it requires food which means you hunt chicken :3, pretty fun if you ask me. So yeah that concludes my review for this game that literally came out yesterday, please give it a try before ranting about it in the reviews... Also one other thing, this game in the requirements says that  it requires:\nOS: 7\nProcessor: Intel Core i7\nMemory: 8 GB RAM\nWith that I will say I beg to differ, if anything this game requires a low-end pc to play, if you have anymore questions about the game before deciding to purchase it, or how to play it once you have it, feel free to add me and message me, always willing to help :).","January 12","true","2.1"," 13 of 29 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","13","29","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Gsurus/recommended/431840/","Gsurus","Gsurus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Gsurus/","137 products in account","I don't review games very often, but I have played a quite a few, and I feel as if the current reviewers are not giving the game enough of a chance, so lets begin shall we? Lets talk about the controls.\n\nControl Scheme:\n\nFrom the moment you start up the game, it is configured to be used by controllers, this is an easy fix, just use the arrow keys to navigate down to options, and set it to keyboard and mouse.\nSomething to note is that you don't have to really use the mouse at all, and it tends to be a bit awkward if you do.\nWhen you first load into the game itself, after the intro cinematic and character creation screen, you start out above a town, and if you look at the bottom of your screen you will see the default controls.\n(It's important to note that these controls can be rebound as by default they may be awkward for some)\nBy default, Space is set to confirm, with B bound to Cancel, Esc to Escape, C to menu, X to submenu and so on.\nI've played about thirty minutes so far, and I have had no issues with the menus or interfaces minus a bit of awkwardness before rebinding.\n\nGameplay:\n\nAs said in the paragraph before, you load into the game, a cutscene plays, and you design your character. After chosing a main objective, (The thing you'll be working towards throughout the game) the game puts you above a village in a sort of top down view which lets you plan your moves. I'm going to call this for simplicities sake the Map. On the map you can do a few things, the first of which is moving. You're able to move up, down, left, or right, each time consuming two food, (You start off with 10 if I remember correctly) At first, you start above a village, which you can choose to enter. Upon entering said village it puts you in a third person view, and you're able to move around the village freely. (Unfortunatly you can't use the mouse to reposition the camera and instead have to use Q and E to move it left and right, and while this is a bit awkward, and the animation for moving the camera is sometimes jerky, you get used to it pretty fast)\nIn villages you can either choose to buy things like armor, weapons, or potions, or you can choose to recruit someone to your party. At the start you are limited to having two people (including yourself) in a party at one time. (I think this number increases as you level) Other than that, there is nothing much else to do in villages.\n\nCombat:\n\nThe combat system is a pretty standard JRPG setup other than one thing, which is a quicktime event upon attacking, if you time it perfectly, you score a critical hit, if you hit it a bit off time you get a standard/weak attack. While it is a bit unforgiving and difficult to score criticals, I think it should be.\n\nCrafting:\n\nThere is also crafting, in which you can create weapons, armor, and potions from things that you collect around varying instances. Pretty run of the mill.\n\nFood and Treasure hunting:\n\nWhen you get too low on food you'll find yourself in a situation where you have to go out and scavenge for it. When you select the option to hunt for food you get put into an instance that has things such as chickens, rabbits, berries, and tomoatoes around. You can switch between a bow, a fishing rod, and a third option that simply lets you observe things around you in first person. This is something I dislike, as hunting for food can get tedious, but that is just out of my lazyness as it is easy to get a lot of food in a relatively short amount of time. Treasure hunting puts you in another instance that puts you in whatever biome you are over, like Food hunting, but instead of spawning chickens and berries, its spawns monsters, and treasure chests. The treasure chests are thrown randomly through the map and can be hard to find, and the monsters tend to chase you which makes it all the more difficult.\n\nOverall I think that this game has some work that needs to be done on it, but it isnt outright broken, and will give you at least a few hours of fun if you're willing to get over/rebind the controls. As I play more, and time progresses, I will update this review as it is not complete, nor have I played enough to fully review it.","January 12","true","1.2"," 67 of 181 people (37%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","37","67","181","3","11"
