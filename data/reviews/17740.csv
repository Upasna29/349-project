"http://steamcommunity.com/id/empiresisawesome/recommended/17740/","empiresisawesome","Bob2","http://steamcommunity.com/id/empiresisawesome/","19 products in account","The tactics involved in playing this game are layered endlessly. If NF has reason to believe you might be heading for straight for railgun heavies, you should respond with a light tank or APC rush early game (unless they are expecting you to, of course). Commanding actual players is extremely challenging but endlessly rewarding. Much like Age of Empires II, the gameplay does not reach any sort of nash-equilibria because the real bottleneck is your own ability to keep track of everything at once.\n\nFor the soldiers on the ground, the game is totally different. The tactical challenge lies is choosing your class, or the loadout of your tank, and in making sure that the decisions of the team as a whole make sense, and that nobody is missing some sneaky enemy tactic. The constant challenge otherwise is of course, to aim and respond, using cover to keep yourself alive while gaining ground on the enemy. All of the guns respond decently, but you'll find your preferences - I love the sniper and pistol, but many prefer the shotguns. Fortunately none of them are so overpowered that they become the only choice.\n\nUnfortunately, although there are many players, most of the time none of them are playing at all. That's why you will see many people arguing over whether the game is "dead" or not. See for yourself with the steam charts tracker[steamcharts.com], which tells you not only if people are playing right now, but also all the trends (saturday and sunday mostly, with a smaller peak on wednesday).\nhttp://steamcharts.com/app/17740","September 9, 2015","true","379.0"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","8","9","0","0"

All of these can be done by a single player.\nMeanwhile, a grenadier carries a mortar against buildings, a rocket launcher against vehicles, landmines, a handgun, the ability to detect mines, and can choose skills such as detecting the armor of enemy tanks, defusing mines, extra armor while driving, and many more.","March 15, 2015","true","590.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/counterstrike/recommended/17740/","counterstrike","BRITTAJIZZUS","http://steamcommunity.com/id/counterstrike/","263 products in account","Very fun game, has a short, but fairly hard learning curve, and then almost infinite potential for improvement.\n\nIn this game it's fairly easy to get good, i.e. be better than 70%, but to be in top 5% you need to really grind certain skillsets, whether it be being a good squad leader, or learn how to land your mortars inch-perfect.\n\nOn the surface, fairly simplistic.\n\nHere's a basic run down (and a rating out of 5) for classes:\n\nEngineer - revives fallen teammates, heals injured teammates, builds and repairs structures (commander dropped) as well as his own (walls/turrets/cameras/radars). Has seismic grenades which are excellent at taking down enemy structures.\n\nEase of learning (highest is easiest) - 5/5\nEase of reaching potential (highest is easiest to get really good at) - 4/5\nAnti-infantry - 2/5\nAnti-tank - 2/5\nAnti-structure - 5/5\nSolo potential (how useful the class is when played alone) - 3/5\nGroup potential (how useful the class is when played in a squad/with teammates) - 5/5\n\nHIGHLY RECOMMEND ENGINEER TO NEW PLAYERS!\n\nRifleman - mows down enemy infantry with ease, provides surpressing fire and long distance fire as well. Important in close combat, but requires engineer support to be fully functional. Has regular and sticky grenades, which can stick onto enemy vehicles and explode causing high damage.\n\nEase of learning - 4/5\nEase of reaching potential  - 3/5\nAnti-infantry - 5/5\nAnti-tank - 1/5 (3/5 with stickies)\nAnti-structure - 1/5\nSolo potential - 1/5\nGroup potential  - 4/5\n\nScout - infilitrator/spy/assassin/James Bond. This is an almost purely support class which is highly useless but  cause can cause a lot of hassle when paired up with another class. Besides regular SMGs available, this class has a scout rifle, a "sniper" rifle as referred by some. Has a hide ability, as well as radar stealth and enemy detection. Has smoke/concussion/stun grenades Generally avoid this class unless you know what you're doing.\n\nEase of learning - 3/5\nEase of reaching potential - 2/5\nAnti-infantry - 3/5\nAnti-tank - 1/5 (2/5 with stun)\nAnti-structure - 3/5\nSolo potential - 2/5\nGroup potential - 4/5\n\n\nGrenadier - it's in the name. Has a pistol, a dumbfire (or guided) RPG, a mortar, and mines. Has good vehicle related skillsets.\n\nEase of learning - 2/5\nEase of reaching potential - 1/5\nAnti-infantry - 4/5\nAnti-tank - 5/5\nAnti-structure - 4/5\nSolo potential - 3/5 (add +1 if you've mastered this class)\nGroup potential - 4/5 (add +1 if you've mastered this class)\n\n\nOnto vehicles:\n\nJeep - basic transportation vehicle carries from 2-4 people (including the driver), has no mountable weapons\nAPC - spawnable-in transportation vehicle carries 8 (including the driver), carries an MG and Grenade Launcher\nLight Tank/AFV - available by default first tank in the game. Carries standard cannon, a dumbfire missile, and a standard machine gun\nMedium Tank - carries advanced weaponry, has increased armor, but reduced speed and manouverability\nHeavy Tank - carries even more advanced weaponry, even more increased armor, but further reduced speed and manouverability\nArtillery Tank - fires up in the air in an arc. Has no short distance capabilites, is usually useful and weeding out the enemy out of a specific area.\n\nThe game has a lot of depth to it which is not obvious on the first play through.\n\nMyself had to reinstall the game 5 times, before I finally ended up liking it.\n\nWould gladly do it again. :)","April 20, 2011","true","893.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

If I were to grade the game strictly on its own merits it would easily be the greatest source mod. However, alot of the "veterans" of the game create an atmosphere which quickly turns away potentially new players. This game has a "commander" who essentially places structures and issues strategy for a team to follow. If you're a new player, never ever even try to command. You will be criticized harshly if you make even one mistake. Essentially this leaves players in a catch 22. You can't gain experience as commander unless you are allowed to command in atleast a 5v5, but if you play a 5v5 you  can't command and get better due to veterans criticizing you to the extent that you just leave. Alot of veterans believe the game is dead/dying due to new players performance as commanders (noted on multiple occasions that vets would blame bad comms for the reason why people would turn away from this game.) This is simply not the case. The game is dying for two reasons. One, source engine is getting old, and two, the majority of the veteran community is extremely unforgiving towards new players. Overall the game itself 10/10, but combined with the  community its probaly closer to 7/10.","May 20, 2014","true","164.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

According to Steam Charts, it's seen a slight growth in its average player count to 15 with a peak count of about 60 in April.\n\nUnfortunately, when I attempted to play the game I could count on one hand the players online. It quickly became clear that the player base isn't there to give the experience the developers envisioned.\n\nI was going to explore the map list but on the first one I picked, the game forced me to opt in to be a "commander" on the server and then vote for myself. The process took a couple minutes, then the game crashed when I tried to spawn, so I decided it wasn't worth the hassle.\n\nIt appears the developer is still actively working on this mod, but considering it's been out since 2008, I'm thinking it's dead. However, as with all the other free-to-play FPS's I'm reviewing this summer, I'll be checking back in the fall or winter and updating my review if there are any significant changes.","May 8","false","0.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","2"

On every team there is one player that has been voted commander by the others. He place buildings, research new technologies and help his team as much as he can.\nThe infantry consists of four classes with different specialities: planting mines, building turrets etc. These classes need to co-operate togheter and with their commander to achive their goal. However, the other team does the same.\n\nGenerally this is a VERY well-made mod and it is constantly improving and I believe it would soon be in state to become it's own game, just as Gary's mod has already done.

It provides a very true to life aspect to  battlefield tactics that many are sure to enjoy.
