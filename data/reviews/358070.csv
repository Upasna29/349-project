I'm going to say a little about getting the most out of the game.\nFirst, think of it more as a 'Garden' that you just leave running in the background, and come back and tend to every so often. For me, that's about every 20mins or so.\n\nAt first, you need to unlock all of the descriptions for the different plant and bug types, so that yo know how they interact... what the feed on, how they reproduce. To do this, you need to keep that plant/bug alive for 5000s straight. I'd recommend focussing on the Moulds first (OK, some of them are Carnivirous, worry about them a bit later, then) and pretty well ignore bugs altogether early game. Why? because The wrong bug can easliy wipe out an entire species or 10 of Mould.\n\nIf you have a Mould or bug that keeps dying, for no reason, it's probably Carnivorous, and has no food. Try reintroducing it once you have a bigger eco system running.\n\nI have yet to create a balanced, self sustaining system. It involves quite a lot more than you might think, actually. Right no I am in the middle of Terraforming to create separate Mini-Biomes, so that I can introduce several complementarty species that can rely on each other, and hopefully not wipe each other out.\n\nThis is the appeal of this game, it's preject with a view to the long term, kind of like making Bonsai.\n\nIt's always interesting when the planet decides to throw something random in the mix, though.","May 3, 2015","true","86.9"," 29 of 29 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","29","29","0","0"

I've enjoyed watching over my world and observing it grow while intervening where necessary. At first my I didn't have much but managed to grow an environment with about 7 or 8 different species. Unfortunately I wasn't managing it well and eventually saw my ecosystem nearly collapse. with only two fungi left and all my bugs gone.\n\nHowever, I manged to bounce back. Once I got a grasp on how the various bugs and fungi interacted, I soon found myself with a healthy enviornment with mushrooms and fungi, plenty of roaches and beetles, mantis to eat them, saw my first spider come in and grow into a little spider society a little away from my mountains with my mushrooms and flies. It bounced back completely, much more diverse and more individual creatures and it felt like I had accomplished something.\n\n\nEarthtongue has a nice balance of being able to interact with the world enough to guide it, but you're not expected to micromanage every single thing. Sometimes I would move a mantis over to a high populous area, or make sure my beetles could thrive elsewhere while their numbers increased, and of course the interventions that tick off every number of years. I feel like a gentle guiding hand to this world and it's a unique experience that I recommend trying!","September 29, 2015","true","6.5"," 20 of 20 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","20","20","0","0"

Well... unless you were a mycologist.\n\nEarthtongue is unique in that it's less of a game and more of a simulator with limited interactions. It still has some minor goals (unlocking journal entries) but everything is largely freeform and open-ended for how you decide on what you want to do with your little fungus world. A fully diverse ecosystem is a thing of beauty and playing Earthtongue will teach you to appreciate the balance such an system requires. It'll show you just how fragile the ecosystem around you -- just like on this simulated planet -- really can be.\n\nWhile its a great little simulator, and I can easily recommend Earthtongue, I wouldn't recommend it to everyone. Its for people who liked games similar to Mountain or watching Breve 3D Evolution simulations. Earthtongue is for people who like watching aquariums full of fish, or ant farms. People who want more interaction with their simulation games -- such as those who play Dwarf Fortress, or SimCity -- probably won't enjoy this nearly as much.","April 27, 2015","true","4.2"," 18 of 18 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","18","18","0","0"

Earthtongue is a unique Vivarium Simulator that does manage to have some complexity to it. The key word that drives this game is experimentation. What lifeforms are suited to each other and which are absolutely horrible for each other. You will use your powers of intervention to poke and prod the ecosystem to a stable state. While Earthtongue doesn't have much in the way of tutorials. It isn't hard to grasp the basic ideas and goals. Earthtongue isn't a game you can really win or lose at either. If you feel the need to burn everything and start over. That option is always available to you. Perhaps you want to see how many species you cram on the planet. What you do, and how you go about it, is all up to you. No matter what you decide it will more then likely take time and patience. Which makes Earthtongue a great game to have running in the background. Occasionally checking in and making sure everything is going well.\nLuckily there is a handy game speed option to match whatever playstyle you prefer. If your more hands on, jack it up to max speed. If you wanna check it occasionally leave it on normal. In all, its a fun little game and family friendly.\n\nI did a Let's Play/First impressions on this game! Come check it out if ya like!\nBig thanks to the developer for this great game!\nHope you enjoy.\nhttps://youtu.be/1mNRO5M2zsQ","April 27, 2015","true","1.6"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","0"

You don't necessarily HAVE to manage anything, you can just let the ecosystem manage itself. That's exactly what I ended up doing most of the time, just watched how the bugs and plants spawned and interacted with each other. I did use the intervention mechanic to speed things along by changing the landscape a bit to make sure bugs didn't get trapped, and to spawn random plants and bugs in spots I thought needed some more life.\n\nI loooove the art style. It's all very, very simple pixels, but I think it works great for the type of game this is. All the bugs and fungi are very distinct from one another, and fun to watch move around the landscape. It's all very colorful as well, never boring to look at.\n\nThat's also one of the reasons I enjoy Earthongue. It's very soothing to just kinda look at and mess with things every once in a while. I had it on while I was at work, and everything moving around combined with the music was just very calming and almost hypnotizing! And I can have it on in the background while I do work, come back to it after a bit and see what happened while I was gone! It's all very fun in a way that I guess I wouldn't describe as a game, but you CAN definitely play it like one. It has that micro-managing, and everything interacts with everything else in specific ways, so figuring out how to keep everything alive has a fun factor all its own!\n\nIf there's anything negative I have to say, I guess that it's just VERY HARD to get that last journal entry! I know I can wait for interventions and form the land and then wait more to spawn the specific things I want, but I didn't feel like I ever wanted to play it that way. That's just me though, I'm sure if I took the time I could form the world to be very specific I could get that 28 diversity, but honestly, I love the degree of randomness to the world, it makes it more interesting to see things unfold.\n\nso yeah, tl;dr the game has a cute art style and very fun micro-managing mechanics, and I personally find it to be a very soothing experience to just let the world unfold, spawn random stuff, and see how it affects everything else!","November 1, 2015","true","8.0"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

The pixel art is lovely and the music is soothing :)\n\nThere aren't any tutorials or instructions, although there are journal entries with specific information on each fungus/insect that are unlocked after a species survives for a long enough time. This means that the player will need to observe the behaviours of the insects and fungi in order to determine how to properly care for them. Some are herbivores, some carnivores - some fungi even eat bugs.\n\nBalancing the ecosystem is both challenging and rewarding. A species can easily die off if they over-consume their food source, for example. Some insects are bad at climbing terrain and may get stuck in an area with no food.\n\nThe player is given Intervention points which replenish over time, and allow them to add insects or fungi, change the weather, or alter the terrain. Choosing a random insect, fungi, or weather effect to add is significantly less expensive than choosing something specific, but of course the player receives less control over what will be added to the ecosystem when it is randomized.\n\nInsects can be picked up and moved by the player, allowing them the option to manually balance the ecosystem. Fungi, however, cannot be moved.\n\nEarthtongue can be addictive to play, but also fun to just leave running while I do other things. It's exciting to come back and see what has grown, which populations have survived, or which species have gone completely extinct ;)","April 28, 2015","true","3.0"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

And bugs, which is always good.\n\nIt has a slow, meditative feel to it, which is in no way meant to sound bad and in every way meant to encourage the purchase if, whether out of pure curiosity or the serious enjoyment of complexity-within-simplicity, you would like to experience the broad brush strokes of intervention in an active and alien bio-system.\n\nYou are an entity lingering over a strange, nutrient-rich landscape with the ability to drop insects and fungi. (Already riveting stuff!) The flora and fauna run on guidelines, within themselves, and with the intention of survival and procreation. Some combinations mesh well, others are at odds, and some develop symbiotic relationships.\n\nThe beetles, for example, are territorial and won't hesitate to attack other insects. However, they leave a lot of carcasses (theirs and their enemy's) along the ground, which is useful for flies to munch greedily upon.\n\nThe setup relies less on action and more on re-action. You push and pull the flow of creatures at a meandering pace, more intent on watching the What and the How than trying to force your agenda. Like a real terrarium of sorts, the experience is in dropping one or two new objects and waiting, or even just checking back in an hour. As you learn what makes every creature unique, the entity will write in-game logs attempting to detail them in ways that you might not have noticed. This datalog adds a touch of flavor, a pinch of tutorial, and a dash of tangible accomplishment to an otherwise fend-for-yourself style of gameplay.\n\nEarthtongue is an experience that doesn't require much of your time or your attention, but it has a richness that will have you quietly watching, maybe scratching your head, maybe nudging a beetle in the right direction, or maybe just smiling.","November 9, 2015","true","6.9"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

People are looking at this game and expecting more than it promises. This is not a fast-paced sim. Even at it's highest speed setting, massive interaction with the enviorment takes a while. However, that is all this game promises. It is a FANTASTIC "aquarium" style simulator. You watch a planet gros and interact with itself, change over time, and you can institute big changes, that might take sometime to devlope. This is a wonderful game for turning on in the background while doing other things and popping in to see how things are going, or just watching for a while when you're bored. Very calming, very awesome. There is a slight learning curve, as there is a very small tutorial and some of the tools are not completely described, but this is a game about experiementation, and it pull off everything it promises to do phenominally.

If you've ever played The Sims or any small-scale simulation game, you'll know you get strangely attached to your little simulated world.  It's yours!  Nobody else will have quite the same interaction with their world, and that makes it really special.\n\nIf you're looking for a really deep, directly engaging game, this probably isn't going to scratch that itch.  Earthtongue is a game that's at its most fun when you check in on it every now and then, tweak a few things, poke at your mantises, cross-pollinate a few mushrooms, and then leave again.\n\nThere's an update coming out pretty soon that'll add user-made customizable gardens, which is a REALLY cool addition.  If you're on the fence right now, that update should probably push you over.\n\nAlso it's just five bucks.  C'mon.

Well, from the description and the screenshots, I assumed it was a charming, pixel-graphic sandbox growth simulator. Instead, I got... Confused. And the game doesn't offer much in terms of explanation.\n\nThis was my first-ever return on Steam. I suppose it's personal preference, but I was turned off by the lack of tutorial or any sort of hint as to what I was expected to do in-game. None at all. Not even a tool tip. I understand that part of the fun is in figuring things out yourself, but that doesn't excuse the complete and utter lack of even the most basic of tutorials detailing what to press when you want to get something done. Hell, I would have accepted even a static image that flashed upon loadup with little arrows and directions hastily scrawled in what looks like Paint.\n\nSure, I don't want my hand held, but any sort of nudge in the right direction is good for a sandbox style game--and especially for one as obscure as Earthtongue. I was just presented with the planet screen you'll see featured in the screenshots, some little boxes with pictures that inadequately indicated what each did (including a number for some resource that I'm not sure how one earned), and headers for each ability/stat that, again, didn't have much information beyond a name.\n\n"Import fungus" had a bunch of pictures of mushrooms. Okay... So what? I can place some mushrooms depending on how much unnamed resource I have. Were some mushrooms better than others? What did I require to grow a mushroom? Would my mushrooms require care? What ate mushrooms? The same went for placing bugs and changing the weather and so on. After fumbling around for almost half an hour all I had to show for my efforts was a handful of dead bugs and the disappointment one feels when they expect one thing and get something else entirely.\n\nI can't comment on much else because I was too busy trying to figure out what to do, in honesty. I don't remember the soundtrack beyond the ambient noise of rain and the graphics are your standard pixel-y retro look.\n\nIf being thrown head first into something and expecting to work it out yourself without any sort of positive/negative feedback to indicate you've done something right/wrong is your thing, then pick this up. If you require even the slightest explanation of game mechanics in order to enjoy a game fully, maybe Earthtongue isn't for you.","March 27","false","0.2"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","2"

You start off knowing nothing about what you're doing and you slowly have to learn the rules of the different species through experience and research notes in game.\n\nThe players role in the ecosystem is two fold, in my experience. Firstly, the player has to introduce the species that will populate the world. Secondly, you will try to maintain the ecosystem. This is done by adding nutrients and water as well as moving bugs and spores to new areas. Most of the game is spent just watching the species cohabitate the once desolate planet.\n\nI've had a lot of fun with it. I've had planet destroying swarms of locusts (a couple hundred in total) that I proceeded to exterminate and completely collapse the worlds ecosystem. I've built massive fungal forests occupied by only spiny slugs, spiders, and wasps. I've fixed a massive overpopulation of herbivores by dropping voracious mantises on them, leading to a massive overpopulation of mantis. Everytime I enjoyed myself and learned a bit more about how to balance the ecosystem.\n\nI would recommend the game if you want something to waste away the time with. It really is a lot of fun to watch.","June 3, 2015","true","0.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It's quite amazing how many of the bugs and fungi have evolved to assist each other in surviving, such as a bug with an immunity to a dangerous fungus for example, and this bug has evolved a specialized stomach to spread this fungus around to help the bug keep a steady supply of food with minimal competition (the bug can eat this fungus, where other bugs have difficulties).\n\nI do however have one complaint. What is with this game's achievements? I'm thinking maybe it was intended to be as relaxing as possible, so the achievements were made to appear after the game is closed? We should at least have the option to change this, I hate having a mass amount of achievements unlocked at the wrong time, and displayed all with the same exact timestamp and not when I actually got them.\n\nIf you like peaceful "Fishtank Screensaver" type games, with minimal interaction, check this game out. Seriously, this game makes me feel like a god, and I love all of my children.

You'll sit there either touching or not touching the environment, and noticing that there's not a lot you can do to really create your own world seemingly, you're only slightly infleuncing what's going on. There's a lot of complex rules seemingly and someone who's willing to experiment with the game may have a lot of fun of it.

As you play more and more -- and catalogue more and more species -- you're also treated to some additional journal entries that reveal something like a backstory, showing who/what you are, and why you're watching the game unfold.

You can reposition bugs and fungus spores at will with a click of your mouse, but for meatier tasks (reshaping the planet tile by tile, introducing new species, summoning rain or lifeform-eradicating meteor showers, etc.), you are charged "intervention points," which build up over time. Consequently, a good chunk of the game consists of making something happen, sitting back and watching the effects, and then making another thing happen a little while later. You can accelerate the rate at which you accrue intervention points by having more biomass on your planet (i.e., more fungi and bugs crawling around at any given moment), and you are also given three speeds (and a pause button) for making time pass more quickly.\n\nThe forced passivity of Earthtongue is at once a good and bad thing. On the plus side, it encourages you to observe and strategize, knowing that time is another resource to manage, and your absence from the world another factor to account for as you play. It makes for a far different gameplay experience than you might be accustomed to seeing. On the negative end, it's sometimes irritating to have to sit around doing nothing while waiting to save up enough intervention points to perform several major maneuvers in succession.\n\nAside from what gripes the game's setup may entail, I've noticed a couple of issues with the game itself. First -- and worst -- is slowdown. When my planet is absolutely crawling with wildlife, the framerate suffers noticeably, and sometimes a portion of the planet won't even have loaded by the time I pan over to it. Second is the slight difficulty involved with clicking and moving things. Some spores are so tiny that you'll click one by accident as you try to pick up a bug, and you'll have no idea you're dragging the spore along as you frantically try to click anything else.\n\nEven with these complaints, I can assure you that I've never once felt frustrated playing Earthtongue. It is as close to a zero-stress experience as I've ever had. It can be mildly irritating to have one of your bugs or fungi face extinction, but you can always re-introduce them later for a few intervention points. If you don't like how your planet is turning out, you can always wipe out its population with a meteor shower, or start over entirely with a single button press. There are no failures in Earthtongue -- only setbacks faced on your way to a goal that you yourself set.\n\nI recommend this game enthusiastically and without hesitation.

It will point out quirks that you will learn as you play for hours on end. It covers the base game-world, but the resources that you manipulate in the game has patterns and limitations, and will appear in any game module.\n\nWorking with the game ecology and finding the in and out of sustainable systems, i want to say the ecosystem is flawed, and the 2d nature of the game is part of the reason. The game life finds local maxima to survive and will burn out over time. Life in this game works like wild fire burning dry trees, leaving behind ash for the next generation to regrow. Maybe this fire analogy is an accuracy way to expect how life will NOT continue to thrive without considerable maintenance by the user to 'fuel the fire' of this system.\n\nTo support the system there are two resources: water and nutrients. How these resources move in the ecosystem limits how plant-like life grows:\n\nRules of water is simple and less critical to life, water refreshes at the lower layers as ground water, and very rarely by rain, life and time drains the water, some life depends on water more than others, the top of mountains are dry and only some plants will naturally migrate and survive on hills.  There is no way for the user to improve the desperation of water without continuous work of manual rainfalls.\n\nHow nutrients replenish in the system, is ideally, by nutrient falls from the air. This is like another rain, but it is governed by rules the user must explore and he can enhance. There is a max cap or nutrients in the system that will fall before it stops and it can be increased by the user, but the amount of time and work to saturate the entire land with even falls automatically is unclear and possibly unachievable when compared to the volume of the land that is slowly increasing.\nIt is the scarcity of nutrients which will kill your ecosystem overtime because of limits how nutrients migrate. The dead rot and emit nutrients back in the surroundings. The living can move and die somewhere else, then rot and make that new land fertile.\n\nThe rules how nutrients, as a particle and in  this 2d space, is what limits life in local maxima of good condition.  Nutrients will over time sink deeper in the ground, and be inaccessible to  all but few plants with the right roots to reach, plants that by chance may never grow above these deep nutrients, and in this a world stacked with deep vertical tiles. Nutrients do not move off tiles on its own, and i am sure, never spread horizontally on its own, this limit of motion is what forces only local healthy sub-ecosystems;  be it intended or a flaw i do not now, but do not expect drainage from ground water to help move nutrients along the world, and happenstance to hot spots of life that need it.\n\nInstead to move and fuel nutrient short term and as a buffer, within supporting life the time of random and a slow nutrient fall hits; you need swarms of creatures feeding and rotting above plants. The creature ecosystem has balancing problems. Ideally there are diminishing returns feeding  nutrients down the food chain, where the loss appears back into the falls, but there are errors of positive feedback; flies and corpses on top of sticky-like plants was one, but was patched; but know where there are dead-eaters stacking, there is a deadlock of nutrients being looped and disappearing in that mini system and not spreading around and hopefully reappearing in the falls somewhere else.\n\nLikely, when the measure life is high in local spots, there are dead zones somewhere else, and like the wild-fire analogy, plants will burn out without fuel from the falls, life will die, and the unique life count will drop down to zero, without your help.\n\nDon't expect life in this game to be self sustaining , expect everything to burn out because resources that fuel this strange life: water and nutrients, do not migrate naturally in the ground, diminish within food chains, and slowly and randomly drop from the sky. Everything burns down like this dying planet.\n","May 12","true","258.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
