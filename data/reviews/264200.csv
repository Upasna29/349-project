Maybe you were a kid like me, wishing that someone would create a game that allowed you to be just as fluid, furrious and fast. Well, wish no longer.\n\nWithin a matter of moments, this game has quickly become one of my favorite titles this year..\nYes, you read that correctly.\n\nIt takes elements of DDR style timed gameplay and gives it to you with a simple 2 button system. Simply press either the left or right mouse buttons OR X and B on a controler and go to town. Such a simple system has never before made you feel like more of a badass.  Further proving that  a good game only requires amazing game design. And that's just what this dev has pulled off.\n\nDon't be fooled by the simplistic gameplay though. This brawler is not simple by any means and faster than you realize it, it will turn on you. Becoming a hardcore slaughter fest. Rating you on how many times you've missed and being rather unforgiving about it. This isn't to say that it's not fair by any means. If you missed, YOU missed. And you will pay for it with reductions to speed, taking damage and losing points.\n\nBut, if you can keep up with the insanity it's throwing at you from all sides, it's one of the single most rewarding feelings you can get from a game. Knowing you've just wrecked a small army of men using nothing but your timing, skill and reaction speed.\n\nFor the price, I can think of no better buy right now on the Steam Store. This indie dev put time and effort into crafting something amazing, beautiful, addictive and mind blowing.\n\nDo yourself a favor. Skip lunch for today and pick this game up right ♥♥♥♥ing now.","March 3, 2014","true","26.9"," 714 of 743 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","714","743","0","13"

There is timing, quickness, decision making, and attention that you need to win the rounds that get exponentially faster through the game.\n\nDon't let the simple graphics fool you, the soundtrack and sfx are top notch and it only makes me hope for a sequel!\n\nDo the devs a favor and nab this game so we can get that sequel with multiplayer (competitive mode anyone?)","October 27, 2014","true","5.1"," 262 of 272 people (96%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","96","262","272","15","9"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jasc0/recommended/264200/","jasc0","Calamity Heart","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jasc0/","84 products in account","I would not have discovered this game if I hadn't watched jacksepticeye play it on Youtube, and as soon as I saw gameplay of it, and saw that it was only $5, I knew I had to get it, and 90 hours of playtime later, I can safely say that it's perhaps the best five dollars I've ever spent.\n\nOne of my favorite types of games are games that are simple to learn, difficult to master, and rank you on how well you did. One Finger Death Punch, Flappy Bird, Spin Copters, Electronic Super Joy, all of them very simple (and cheap) games that I've put more hours in than I've put into any other type of game. But like every game, even one as good as I think One Finger Death Punch is, there were some hiccups.\n\nWhat I liked about the game:\n\n- Flexible difficulty: 1FDP is the only game I've come across so far that has such a flawless, seamless method of adjusting its difficulty level to player skill. If you were able to clear a level with little effort, it upped the speed a tad. If you did alright, it kept you as is. If you lost, or just -barely- beat it, it stepped you down a tad. There's still that "Easy > Normal > Hard" mechanic in the form of the Student, Master, and Grandmaster difficulties, which don't take you under a certain speed, but the flexibility remains, and it is pretty much perfect.\n\n- Shadow enemies: If an enemy design in a game as simple as 1FDP can make you -nervous- when you encounter it, that is excellent design, and the "shadow enemies" encountered in the later stages of Master, and nearly all the stages of Grandmaster are exactly that. Most enemies have an indicator below them that shows what order you need to click them in order to defeat them, and a color that corresponds to this order. Shadow enemies have neither, and because of this, it's nerve-wracking whenever you encounter them, because you don't know how many hits it'll take to defeat them, or whether or not they'll change sides. That sense of uncertainty adds a greater depth of challenge to an already very challenging game.\n\n- Atmosphere: It's a two-dimensional, two-button beat-em-up. The main character is a plain white, indescript stickman. The only variety between enemies is color, and sometimes a hat. And still, the game manages to make you feel like you're Bruce Lee, with an amazing soundtrack in the background, and an endless array of lightspeed punches kicks, blood, sound effects, bodies flying into the air, stuff breaking, exploding, collapsing, etc. And when it's all over, you can't help but take a deep breath at how epic it was, especially when you just got a perfect round.\n\n- Forking Progression: Progression in 1FDP is not linear in the sense that there is only one clearly-placed way to go, and if you're having trouble on a level, you just have to keep attacking it over and over and over until you finally win. 1FDP's, levels fork off into various paths in the middle, such that at any given time, you could have up to five or six levels available at one time to play. The forks taper back into a linear progression near the end, which I feel is appropriate, but the multitudes of forking paths in the middle was stunningly impressive to me.\n\nNow, for what I didn't like:\n\n- The Tutorial Levels: 1FDP is an incredibly simple game. It's so simple that the first six or so levels that -constantly- stop the gameplay in order to beat incredibly obvious mechanics into your skull, are completely redundant and unnecessary. From the first second of the first level, just by -glancing- at my character, and the oncoming enemy, I knew exactly what I had to do, which made it very annoying to me when everything kept pausing in order to waste time explaining it. Oh, the enemy with TWO bars underneath him takes TWO hits to defeat? You don't say! It irks me when games treat their players like they're idiots, especially games as simple as this one.\n\n- Wasted Design Opportunities: I feel like SDG dropped the ball in a few places in terms of designing mechanics, particularly, weapon design. There are two categories of weapon: melee and ranged, and three types of weapons for each category, sword, staff, and club for melee, arrow, dagger, and bomb for ranged. And other than the melee throw special, which, unless you take the Throw Weapon skill, you'll only see about 20% of the time, -all- the weapons in either given category do the -exact- same thing. Every ranged weapon gives you a one-hit kill. Every melee weapon extends your hit range. I feel like SDG could have done more with the weapons without compromising the simplicity of the game. Have staff weapons increase the range, have swords do two points of damage per hit, have clubs knock enemies back into the enemy behind them when they kill them, stalling that side of the screen for a moment. And something similar for  the ranged weapons. As it is, it's not bad at all, but I just feel like it could have been -better-.\n\nThis extends to the types of available levels as well. There's literally no difference between Light Sword rounds and Nunchaku Rounds besides color scheme and the obvious use of different weapons. And while those levels are -awesome-, they could have been done better, differently, to add a touch more variety.\n\nOverall, despite the annoying, needless idiot test at the very beginning of the game, and the wasted design opportunities, this is an absolutely amazing game for its price, and I'd give it an easy 9.7/10. Get it. You won't regret it.","October 21, 2014","true","106.8"," 163 of 175 people (93%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","93","163","175","10","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/264200/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2819 products in account","One Finger Death Punch is an action game produced by Silver Dollar Games. It was released in early 2014 and then ported onto IOS a couple of weeks ago.\n\nOFDP has two game modes, a story campaign, and a survival mode. The story mode is set out on a map, and you choose your route around stopping at each level, the levels can have different goals, such as timed events and knocking a certain amount of enemies through objects - there is a good variety of goals to stop each level feeling the same every time.\n\nThe actual game play is a very simple idea; you are unable to move the character from the spot he is in, all you do is turn side to side attacking the on coming enemies. You use the left and right mouse button to correspond with which side you want to attack. To start with it is very easy as the enemies are basic; but as you progress further into the game, enemies require different combinations of attacks to kill them, for instance you hit an enemy once on the right, and then he might end up jumping over to the other side and then back again, meaning you are constantly having to be aware of your entire surroundings at all times. It gets super hectic!\n\nIn the story mode there are three difficulty settings, student, master and grand-master. These effect the amount of enemies you get in each stage, the speed which they come at you and the amount of hit points your character has. I struggled on the easiest setting, Student. So that gives you an idea at how hard this game can be.\n\nThe graphics are simple, all the characters are fleshed out stick figures, honestly this makes the game have a little extra charm though. You are clearly able to tell what the characters are doing at all times, and it actually makes for an interesting watch for people not actually playing. There are a number of different backgrounds which you go through on the story mode; each of which are nicely designed.\n\nTo get through the story mode in One Finger Death Punch on student mode; it took me about four hours. This leaves tons of replay-ability in the survival mode, as well as upping the difficulty and replaying the story. Personally I am satisfied with the amount of time it took me to finish though, it's a cheap game and I easily got my money worth.\n\nI had no technical problems while playing; the game has controller support, but you probably wont need it given that the controls are purely left and right mouse buttons. However it is nice to see controller support being added as default.\n\nOne Finger Death Punch definitely has a place in everybody's library; it is cheap and you can get hours of action in it. This is the type of game you could play with friends round taking it in turns. The game is highly addictive; and most of all, its just a REALLY fun game.\n\n1) Stay away\n2) Only recommended when on sale\n3) Recommended\n4) Highly recommended\n5) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

It’s the kind of game that is simple enough for anyone to pick-up and start playing, while also having the depth, intricacy, and difficulty capabilities to beguile even the most hardcore gamers.\n\nThe identity of the game begins with the minimalist art direction and uncomplicated control scheme.  The gameplay consists of timing your pressing of 2 buttons (either on a keyboard, mouse, or gamepad) while your stick-figure character beats the devil out of other stick-figure characters in choreographed kung-fu animations... in the style made popular by the Xiao Xiao shorts that you may have seen on websites like Newgrounds.\n\nThis overly-simple style is welcoming to any gamer who may want to try it.  Once you become inevitably addicted, the game will continuously scale its speed to your ability in an attempt to allow you to make it as challenging or easy as you want/need.  If you desire a real challenge, you can try to beat all levels without any mistakes and/or without taking any damage.  Or, you can play survival modes and try to get as far as you can before the sheer speed of the game overwhelms you and the hand-eye reflex center of your brain explodes.\n\nRegardless of what level of intensity/difficulty you choose to experience the game at, you should find plenty of ways to have some fun.  To keep things from growing boring while you traverse the huge world-map of the campaign, there are many different game mode variations from level to level.  You can also choose to explore branching paths to unlock new abilities, or beeline to the end if you want to just take on the boss.\n\nAlso, to ensure that the most addicted of gamers have plenty to work for, the “Mastery” system can provide hours of playtime as you grind out more and more high scores to raise your point total.  You also can compete with your friends on leaderboards to show off your pro-gaming skills.\n\nIn short, One Finger Death Punch is a great game to check out if you are looking for something novel and different to experience.  And if you only try a few indie games a year, this deserves to be one of them.\n\nFollow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!","November 22, 2015","true","27.3"," 139 of 158 people (88%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","88","139","158","12","0"

It oozes personality, which is great if you don't mind extremely over-the-top Pan-Asian kung-fu stylings, complete with a very exaggerated Mr. Miyagi voice guiding you through the levels. I love it, myself, but I could see some people wincing at it, just a bit. I have a long history of giddily watching hordes of nameless dudes get bent by the likes of Bruce Lee, Jackie Chan, Jet Li, etc, and if that's you as well, you'll be re-enacting your favorite fight scenes in your head by the first few very very fast levels in this game. If you can get through a whole session of play without pulling even a little Bruce Lee yell after you finish one of the stages then I'm not sure I want to know you.\n\nTwo buttons. Two buttons is all it takes, if you have a game that has: surgeon-like responsiveness, incredible sound effects, simple but effective enemy styles, a ridiculous amount of fun and varied levels, great level music that adds the perfect touch to the kung-fu atmosphere but never terribly gets in the way... I could go on but what I'm trying to say is, this is a damn well put together piece of game. You can sort of tell how obsessive the devs were about nailing the gameplay, like mental patient obsessive, like crazy genius inventors living in a weird creepy tower obsessive, and I'm so glad they were. On another planet they'd be curing cancer but here they're making this game! Praise Jesus. Yes, on first glance it looks like a Newgrounds game. Who cares? It's brilliant.

You only use the left and right mouse button to fight -- you don't even move the mouse.  (So really this should be named Two Finger Death Punch.)  This is simple to learn but difficult to master due to a few challenges: timing the button presses, varying enemy behavior, and the speed of the game (which increases as your progress).  The game also has different mini-games and intense achievements giving you both variety and fun challenges.  If that is not enough, the soundtrack is very enjoyable as is the in-game sense of humor.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aussiedroid/recommended/264200/","aussiedroid","Aussiedroid","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aussiedroid/","744 products in account","One Finger Death Punch (OFDP) makes you feel like you are Bruce Lee in 2D! Well at least when you are doing well, and that is far from guaranteed. The gameplay is hard, despite being controlled purely by two buttons.\n\nAs you progress through the Story Mode, you are introduced to a varied range of levels. Each a different type of challenge, with each testing your reflexes and timing. One of the more difficult parts I found was getting the timing right. You have a bar at the bottom of the screen that guides you, but there are sections during most levels where the speed slows down, and adjusting to those frequent changes can interrupt your rhythm. You also need to think, choose your tactics on which enemy to attack first. Often you will encounter the opportunity to kill left or right at the same time, and that choice could mean the difference between getting hit or missing an attack (Missing will leave you vulnerable to attacks). Juggling all these factors in your head every split-second, while you try to get the timing perfect is truly a challenge to master.\n\nEven when I got past a level, I found myself going back to see if I could do better and try for that perfect run (besides its good practice). Levels are intense, albeit short 1-4min runs. It's a blast to play and good to pick up for a quick session.\n\nI was pretty impressed by the amount of content provided in OFDP, including a wide range of enemies to defeat. These start simple, such as ones that need to be hit twice before they die, but then you quickly get introduced to more complex patterns such as ones that switch sides or leader mobs that you need to beat with longer combos. There is a healthy selection of weapons you can pick up from your slain enemies, unlockable special skills plus an extensive number of attack moves and martial arts styles are incorporated. There are multiple difficulty levels to unlock as well as the ultimate Survival Mode (plus all the level modes in Story Mode too).\n\nArtistic style throughout is very well done, from the stick figure animations to the comic book graphic effects, plus the often busy destructible backgrounds & environmental effects. Not to mention the quality in-game sound effects and soundtrack; it all complements the gameplay nicely. Particular standout for me is the voice over guy, the Kung-Fu Master. I could just picture him doing a badly lip-synced English dub of some 1970s Hong Kong Kung-Fu flick every time he talked!\n\nThe only real drawback I have started to experience is getting stuck. I said earlier that the game is hard, and on top of that I'm pretty average, getting stuck a few times already just on Student. Repeating the same difficult challenge over and over can get demoralising & frustrating. I like the challenge, but for me having it a bit easier (at least at the student level) would have been a better learning curve. I also wish there was an option to bypass the launcher without having to set it to full screen every time - minor frustration.\n\nRegardless of the difficult drawbacks, OFDP will have you yelling Kung-Fu sounds at your computer screen (hmm ok maybe that's just me?), when you pull off that epic power move! I was  pleasantly surprised at how fun & addictive OFDP is to play. The gameplay is polished, balanced with great execution.\n\nSuch a simple concept, yet offers more intense fighting than many of its more 'advanced' 3D counterparts.\n\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this review, please follow True Blue Reviews for more recommendations!","December 6, 2014","true","4.8"," 38 of 40 people (95%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","95","38","40","3","4"

This game is made by Silver dollar games, a studio that honestly haven't made any good games in the past. This game catched me and many others by surprise.\n\nThe gameplay is simple, yet very difficult as you go forward. You play with your 2 mouse buttons, thats it. Attack right and left, in the right pace. The game has a very nice rhythm, put together with great soundtrack. Every punch and kick feels so good, thanks to very responsive controls.\n\nThe only downside to this otherwise great game is the graphics. Textures on the map looks bad. When you play it doesn't really matter though, only when you scroll through the levels. The figher you play as looks like a stickman, meaning the graphics is very simple, but does the job alright.\n\nThere's a lot of levels to play through, and 3 difficulty stages. When you're done with that there is also endless survival, highscores to beat (both your own and your friends) and other gamemodes available. A fun narrator will guide you forward as you learn new abilities. You can mix and match them as you like, and try different things out every run.\n\n\nI'm proud to say that this is one of my favorite games of 2014, and I think everyone should give it a try.","January 10, 2015","true","40.5"," 48 of 59 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","48","59","0","5"

Maybe..you never used a mouse?”\nAnd thus he died 5 clicks later..\n\nYes...you are right. It was the most epic ending ever.\n\n\nOkay. Enough of this fictional nonsense. I apologize for using one of my favourite movies to catch your attention but One Finger Death Punch deserves it. Easy to learn, difficult to master, impossible to find boring. Simplistic visuals meet funny and crazy effects, entertaining for hours. All you have to own is a mouse, concentration and at least two fingers, hopefully on one hand. As a master of arts there is only one goal: Finish all missions, unlock all skills and be the best. There is no need for storytelling here, all you have to know is: Use your left and right mouse buttons.\n\nAgain, you only need your mouse. Choose between story and survival and hit start. Story offers a huge amount of missions to unlock skills and learn more about your enemies. Be prepared for time trial, dagger rounds, destroy objects, nunchakus, boss-fights and many many more. Survival offers what it has to offer: Kill as many enemies before you get killed. After having killed a certain number, bonus rounds will start, offering a chance to replenish your health. Health, weapons, skills, range and enemy hit bars are always manageable due to a simple but precise User Interface. Sound effects are gorgeous, offering many laughs and “Ewwws” after barrels got crushed, bones broken, bodies impaled and hearts got separated from their owner.\n\nGameplay is simple. Enemies will approach from the left and the right side, forcing you to hit the right mouse buttons at the right time. Button Smashing means failure and leads to misses and death. Enemies with the same colour share the same pattern. For example: Green enemies need to be hit 2 times from the same side, red enemies need 3 hits and blue victims need one hit - but from both sides. What makes it even harder is the speed. The further you progress the faster you will have to react. This game is fair. If a mission is too hard and you fail over and over again, speed will adjust to make it easier to finish.Thus keeps motivation high and frustration low.\nSome enemies use and drop weapons that can be picked and thrown for maximum comic violence. Master powerful skills that allow to shoot bows 3 times instead of one, freeze enemies or shake the ground with the Deep Impact Skill and instantly clear the whole screen.\nEnough explanatory banter.\n\n\nBig text, quick facts:\nPro:\nSimple Controls - satisfying outcome\nMinimalistic 2D visuals with funny and bloody effects\nPerfect sound effects meet traditional ambient noise\nA vast amount of missions to complete - with dozens of playmodes\nRandom fighting stances, weapons, additional survival modes and skills to unlock motivate for hours\nDifficulty adjusts to the player’s skill, minimizing the frustration\nComic gore, violence and splatter - bloody, but funny\nCon:\nExpect to smash your mouse and lose some hair when difficulty starts to make fun of you\nFun or not - repetitive. Play 2 hours and take a break\nSadly - no multiplayer\n\nSummary:\nThis gem slept for months until I finally decided to install and play it. What you see is what you get. A brilliant 2D arcade action game that rewards precise clicking instead of button smashing. It doesn`t need a story to entertain for hours and offers dozens of missions, skills and bone breaking weapons instead.\n\nFans of Kung Fury: Street Rage should instantly buy it. It might lack retro graphics and nazi beatings but I personally prefer the variable playstyles and content that motivates for hours.\n\nVerdict: 9 / 10\n\nNo drama, Just Reviews","June 14, 2015","true","11.7"," 71 of 98 people (72%) found this review helpful 35 people found this review funny","72","71","98","35","9"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jadarma/recommended/264200/","Jadarma","Jadarma","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jadarma/","267 products in account","OverviewOne Finger Death Punch is a small scale indie game that managed to go big! It takes the all to known stickman one vs all fight that dominated the Flash era and puts it into a fun and actually addictive game that's literally all on your fingertips! Fight hordes of enemies in over 250 levels that span across multiple game modes and three survival challenges.\n\nThe Pros:Fun! - The main focus of this game is to keep you hooked, and it does just that. The gameplay is fun, the learning curve just right, the different game modes keep the game interesting and fight off repetitiveness even in long play sessions. It's one of those games that have a stupidly simple concept, but excel in execution.\n\nSkill & Reflex Development - It's really interesting if you document your performance in the game and play for a while. The learning curve is just right, and after a few hours you will find yourself getting better and better, but so do the levels. There are lots of things to put your skills to the test so you never feel like you quite mastered the game. There are 250 levels, three difficulty levels, and three endless modes to test your might in.\n\nSimple Controls - The game itself makes fun of it's title (Check the first earned achievement). But seriously, the fact that you only need two buttons to play this game is a huge bonus. It's perfect for when you just want to lay back and relax. Put your feet on the desk and play with your mouse. Or load this game on you laptop and use A/D while bored on the go. It is an excellent  time killer, too!\nThe Cons:No Steam Cloud - I really wished this had Steam Cloud, as it relies on character development, unlocking skills that are spread on the map, keeping an overall score of all your progress, etc. Forgetting to backup before a drive format, or not being able to link your save from your PC / Laptop is a real bummer.\n\nVisuals - There is no way to change the resolution and to some extent you can see slight stretching if playing in fullscreen. There are no settings whatsoever, too. Also, I can't decide whether to like the fact that it looks like a run-of-the-mill online flash game or not. It fits the game nicely, but just a personal preference - would have been nice to have a more minimalist look to it, without so many randomly coloured textures everywhere.\nConclusionThis is a really nice game and definitely deserves the rating it received. It's cheap, and it's a game that offers simple, mindless fun and a skill test.

What do you mean, what kind of review is that? Ok, ok...\n\nFirst, I've played this game for hours when it was released on Desura. I know a bit about this game. One Finger Death Punch is a brawler; it's just you against hordes of opponents. If you hate brawlers, or this genre in general, I have news for you. OFDP is not one of those games. It's a game about timing. You use your mouse (or, if you're a sucker for punishment, a controller) and click either the left button or the right button. That's it. That's the entire game right there. Except, until you actually play the game, you won't realise just how incredibly well realised this simple control system actually is. Enemies approach from the left and right of the screen, with you in the center, and when they move into range you have to put them down in the most bad-♥♥♥ kung-fu way possible. To achieve this, you click the left or the right mouse button depending on whether the opponent is on your left or your right. Your fist / foot connects with your opponents head / chest in a suitably bone-crunching manner, and you feel good. And it continues like this, getting slowly faster and faster, and increasingly insane, until you realise you have a huge grin on your face and you're kung-fu fighting like a master. Rarely has such a simple game offered such empowerment and the simple joy of looking awesome. It's also the closest many of us will likely come to a pure zen state of concentration.\n\nThere's more to it that that, with different enemy types that require different combinations to defeat, a variety of weapons to use (melee and ranged), a selection of power-ups that become increasingly important on the later, more difficult levels, and a variety of different game styles from straight-up mob action to laser sword rounds and mono colour rounds. The game just keeps throwing new and inventive stuff your way, and that grin rarely leaves your face. I won't spoil some of the better surprises, but there are quite a few.\n\nSo yes, buy this game and play it, and if you don't like it then you're probably already dead, or something.","March 4, 2014","true","7.5"," 25 of 27 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","25","27","0","1"

But as I played more and more, I realized the straightforward controls were a good thing. And although the controls may be simple, the game is not. One Finger Death Punch is easy to learn, easy to jump into, but hard to completely master.\n\nYou are a stick figure defending yourself against hordes of other stick figures. Left click to attack left, right click to attack right. If you attack without hitting an enemy, a "miss" is counted against you. Missing leaves you vulnerable to attack, and lowers your score for the stage. Your objective varies from stage to stage, but it's usually surviving a certain number of enemies.\n\nPlaying One Finger Death Punch requires not only quick reflexes but also quick thinking. If there are enemies in both the left and right attack zones, which way should you attack first? You have to take into account how close each enemy is to you, what color the enemies are, whatever weapons/goodies they may be carrying, and your reflex speed... all in a split second.\n\nHowever, the two-button thing comes with a drawback. Even though new enemies, weapons, level types, and skills are introduced along the way, you're still doing the same basic actions: clicking left mouse button and clicking right mouse button. The game may be a great idea with great execution, but boredom can seep in after playing for so long in one sitting. But despite this downside, I'd still say the price tag fits.\n\nPros\nEasy to learn.\nFast-paced combat.\nVarying objectives/different enemy types to spice things up.\nSimple but awesome art style.\nGreat music, fits the mood.\nTons of fun.\nCons\nGameplay can get repetitive; I never play for more than an hour at a time.\nLevel map is awkward to navigate.\nToo many levels, and sometimes levels are too long.\nLoading screen hints can be annoying advertisements for a game you already bought. (more of a nitpick tho)\nTL;DR In short, this is the most fun I've ever had clicking the left and right mouse buttons in quick succession. Definitely recommended.","November 24, 2014","true","6.1"," 26 of 29 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","26","29","0","0"

However, its extremely addicting. I downloaded thinking I would just put an hour into this game as it was from the Groupees BMX that I got the game from and found myself playing longer than that.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gitorian/recommended/264200/","gitorian","Gitorian","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gitorian/","108 products in account","In One Finger Death Punch you play as a stick figure shaped kung fu expert. You'll fend off enemies as the pour out at you from either side, steal their weapons and chain crazy combos of movies. The odd part? The gameplay only uses two buttons: the left and right mouse button. You do not move your character and only the momentum of your moves will carry you from side to side. The goal is (often) to kill a key number of foes by attacking left or right as soon as they enter range.\n\nIt sounds easy, but it isn't. Some enemies will require multiple hits or dodge to the left and right of you. Others will engage you in a combo battle requiring you to input a string of left and right key presses. Enemies come at you with ever increasing speed and it gets more and more challenging to key in the best possible patterns to defeat them all.\n\nWeapons and combo chains will increase your attack range while new abilities can be learned as you travel the map. Three abilities can be equipped at any given time and each has a different affect during combat. Some increase the usefulness of weapons while others launch a super move after you achieved a target number of kills.\n\nAlthough the characters are simplistic stick figures, combat is smooth, dynamic and engaging to watch. Every so often your fist will punch through a foe or send an eyeball flying at the screen. Every so often you will impale your opponent on a weapon. It's all pretty slick and set to a beat that maintains a good level of excitement as foes charge faster and faster towards you.\n\nI was a bit sceptic at first, seeing that the game only used two buttons, but I'm now convinced that the developpers have pulled off a brilliant and simple game. It has a real arcade vibe and is meant to be played as such. You often find yourself jubilating from that much sought after arcade frenzy while completing a two minutes level, killing two enemies per second, clicking five times in the same timespan and all of that without breathing.\nThe art design is pleasing although non essential. You do tend to ignore the graphics part and concentrate on not dying.\nThe difficulty ramp-up is too slow due to a ridiculously long campaign. The game starts off really slow and easy and ends up being so fast you physically cannot click fast enough with your mouse to kill the stickmen in time. Overall, the campaign mode could use a bit of work and maybe the emphasis on it is too strong.\nAnother problem with the game is the lack of proper sound options. As I recall, music and announcer voice can only be turned off/on, and there is not even a toggle for sound effects.\n\nAll in all really good for both casual players and hardcore arcade gamers in the "simple to play, hard to master" philosophy.","January 12","true","159.1"," 21 of 23 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","21","23","0","0"

Looking at the video on the Steam page may make you think that you can get through this "simple" game with button-mashing. However, you're very wrong if you think that way. The game warns you from the very start that button-mashing will get you nowhere. One Finger Death Punch builds on its simple controls to create a gameplay system that gets positively sophisticated.\n\nYou will face different enemy types that require different combinations of clicks/keypresses to defeat. While the fundamental gameplay mechanic (left click/arrow to hit left, right click/arrow to hit right) stays the same, the different combinations add up to make up for a fascinating gameplay experience. Let's just put it this way - the moment you think that you've got the game figured out, it throws you a new enemy type, a different level mode that challenge you to sharpen the very skills you thought you've mastered.\n\nThere is an RPG element to this game. As you progress through the game, skills become unlocked. These skills add on to your overall gameplay experience and help you manage as the pace of the game gets faster and faster.\n\nOne thing that surprised me about this game is how the voice acting (well, if we can refer to the sensei as that) adds to the game. It gives the whole game (each and every stage) some sort of dramatic sense with the sensei explaining to you the game mechanics.\n\nI find myself coming again and again to clear earlier stages, trying to outdo myself each time. I would love to see this game on a handheld (e.g. PlayStation Vita).\n\nI definitely recommend this game. It's amazing how a well-polished gameplay system can bring the fun that we've been seeking (perhaps in the wrong places)\n\n","May 13, 2014","true","1.3"," 17 of 17 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","17","17","0","0"

OFDP does not try to do anything that this type of game shouldn't do, and that is why it works so damn well.  In a game where the player is given two buttons, that's right, TWO, there is no room for error.  The execution of the combined game-play elements must be perfect -- and they are!  Each fight will have the player begging for more.\n\nThe game-play is fast paced and beautifully balanced.  There is no drawn-out tutorial, but everything that the player needs to know is explained before or as it is needed.  The rate in which the game increases in difficulty is awesome!  The game will adjust the challenge so that the player is always being pushed to the limit without making it too hard to enjoy.\n\nI almost never bring up music in a review; however, the music in this game will set the pace and the mood for the combat!

Most games would force you to memorize complicated button sequences but in this game it’s all with two buttons. You don’t even have to move a mouse or a thumb stick, just two buttons.\nCan something so simple as a two button game be fun? In this case, yes. The game requires timing and focus as button mashing will make you die an agonizing death. I find myself in a trance like state playing this game.

It features stickmen engaging in kung-fu, to about 5 different songs, and 5 different backdrops. The "gimmick," if you will, of OFDP is that it is played with just two buttons, M1 and M2 (X and B on a controller). Simply put, M1 is left attack and M2 is right attack. Very simple controls.\n\nIt is surprising how addictive this game is. With a concept so simple, you would think it would be repetitive, and boring after the novelty of it wears off. The thing is, OFDP manages to use this concept so incredibly right that you can just keep going and going and going...\n\nIt is responsive as hell. The music is catchy, and while there isn't much of a variety of music, it never seems to matter. The animations are as good as stickmen-kung-fu is going to get.

You get home from work or school (or both), you're tired, stressed out, and you need something to help you release some steam. Since us humans are sadistic sons of b's, one of the best way for us to deal with stress is by causing as much pain as physically possible upon others. And that is where "One Finger Death Punch" kicks in!\n\n"One Finger Death Punch" is a martial arts Beat-Em-Up (kind of) developed and published by Silver Dollar Games. Prior to this game, the company had a really bad record of Xbox Live Arcade games that were just complete, utter garbage! And if you check out their website[www.silverdollargames.com], you'd think that there's just no way these people will ever make anything good! But then, in one final attempt to save themselves from being cast into an abyss of doom, they put it all on this game. And that was the smartest thing they could have ever done.\n\nLet's talk about the story of "One Finger Death Punch": ... Moving on!\n\nYou can tell that this game ran on a tight budget during development, so Silver Dollar Games had to make the best out of what very little they had, and it came together majestically. All the characters in this game are simple stick figures, perhaps only differentiated by colors and a few accessories, but that works greatly in the game's favor. No enemy coming to screen will distract you with any kind of extravagant design, so you can always focus on the next thing that requires your attention. Your character is also just a standard stick figure, but thanks to the camera putting him / her in the dead center of the screen, you'll never confuse your character with an enemy. All the props blend in with the background, and when they break from someone crashing into them, they serve to add to the impact of every hit. And speaking of impact, every single attack you deliver (or receive) has a lot of weight behind it. Every single attack really gives the illusion that you just beat someone's s*** in, and it is glorious! Despite the fact that the HUD takes up a large portion of the screen, it doesn't actually interrupt your game because it has its own dedicated spot, unlike most HUD's that are just slapped somewhere on your screen. The game's visuals are simple, but come together to immerse the player into the experience beautifully!\n\nIt's called "One Finger Death Punch" because you legitimately only need one finger to play this game. All you have to do is click the left or right mouse button (or keyboard / gamepad if you so desire) that corresponds to the direction of the enemies approaching you. If I had to summarize the gameplay of "One Finger Death Punch" in one word, it'd be "precise." This is possibly the most responsive game I have played in my life, more so than even the greatest rhythm games out there (reminder: this is not a rhythm game). Each and every single action you make will either reward you or punish you. The game is in complete favor of skill, and if you think you can just spam your way to victory, you will die; if you fail, it's your fault and your fault alone. As you continue playing through the levels, you will unlock special skills that will aid you in battle, but it's clear that all of these skills are optional; they help a lot, but if you want to challenge yourself even more by not using any skills, you're more than welcome to. Other than your fists, you've also got an arsenal of melee weapons and projectiles that you can obtain from beating enemies or from the level itself. As you continue playing, the game will speed up or slow down depending on how well you've performed. By nature, this game is fast-paced, but it can get ludicrously fast if it thinks you're good enough. And if you are good enough, sir or madam, I tip my hat to you. Loading times are also more-or-less non-existent, so you don't have to worry about having to wait to get back in the action. There's very little strategy - it's all about your skill and reflexes.\n\nDat. Soundtrack. It's actually royalty free. However, that doesn't retract from how incredibly well the music mixes in with all the stages, getting you mad-pumped for the high-speed, brutal action that is about to commence. The sound effects of the game feel like they're straight-out of a classic kung-fu film, and they're awesome! Each attack has a fitting sound effect, adding even more oomph to every strike. There is also one voice actor (outside of grunts and moans) in this game, and that is your kung-fu master. He sounds very stereotypical and cheesy, but that all, again, just adds to the experience.\n\nAll of "One Finger Death Punch's" features come together to make you feel like a GOD. It is over-the-top, fast, addicting, and all-around an amazing game. Not only that, but this game also serves as an example for many gaming companies: you can make a good game, regardless of how much trash you've made in the past. Silver Dollar Games redeemed themselves from their sins with this master piece of a product, and I want to see more companies follow their steps! I whole-heatedly, 100% recommend this game. It should run perfectly fine on any normal computer, and it's only $5! If this seems like your type of game, do not even for a second hesitate to buy it!","May 9, 2015","true","11.7"," 19 of 24 people (79%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","79","19","24","5","0"

I saw all the positive reviews and comments, but I just couldn't accept that this game was that good. I'm so glad I bought it anyway. It's not often I play a game just for its gameplay, but I couldn't stop playing One Finger Death Punch. The name is fitting, because that's pretty much what it does to your time if you're not careful. This is a game that has such great and clever mechanics at work that it doesn't need anything else to deliver an amazing experience.\n\nOne Finger Death Punch brings a staggering level of depth to the table. That's surprising, because all you need to play the game are your two mouse buttons. This may seem dull at first, but it's not long before the game starts throwing in more mechanics to spice things up. For instance, enemies will sometimes drop weapons upon death that you can pick up to extend your reach. That's nice since the game quickly starts throwing different enemies at you requiring several button presses rather than just the one. The thrill of mastering there different enemy types and ripping through dozens of foes in an epic, bloody spectacle of glory is thrilling. The game's difficulty scales with your performance, so the more you win the faster it gets, while a loss will slow things down a bit so you can keep up. There are also several different types of battles you can engage in, varying from simple mob fights to rounds where you fights off dozens of enemies with a light sword (not a saber) with a raging inferno blazing in the background.\n\nDon't concern yourself with the game's length either, because it will take several hours just to beat the 'student' difficulty of level mode. There are two more difficulty modes that come after along with survival modes to test your skill in. I've beaten the 'student' difficulty and have made some progress in the next difficulty up, but I still find it immensely fun to go back to easier levels and perfect my technique. If you love a simple game that you can sit down and play for a bit or 4 hours straight, then pick up One Finger Death Punch. I may have gotten it half off, but I would gladly pay full price for a game this exciting and long.","January 4","true","10.3"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","11","11","0","0"

For just $5 or less you can get an extremely addictive game that will keep you going for hours. There are 250 levels in the campaign alone in addition to several modes including survival. The campaign will run you at least 15 hours if not more so the overall value of this game is extremely high.\n\nYou are a Kung Fu master and through just 2 buttons you decimate your enemies with a variety of styles, weapons and objectives. Some of my favorite types of matches are light saber levels, timed destruction and mob levels!\n\nThe game really has the juice to keep you entertained and coming back for more. It's a title that instantly makes it to my favorites tab; I will continue to play and keep trucking towards 100%. Finally, I love the "Mastery" section which shows you the total percent complete you are with the game; an hour will give you around 3-5% total mastery.\n\nWorth the full $5!

You want heart pumping, in your face, non stop action? Bad ♥♥♥ imagery to go along with all that? This is the game for you....unless you have a heart condition, in which case I dont recommend it, because when I say heart pumping, I am being literal. Your heartbeat will be elevated when you play this game.\n\nPrior to playing this, I had been enamored of Divekick's minimalist and yet brilliant approach to a fighter...namely two buttons and movement via attacks alone. While I still appreciate that game, One Finger Death Punch takes the two button, movement via attacking gameplay to a completely different level. Your controls are simply left and right and you can play using your mouse or any style of gamepad. It's optimized for all of them, up to and including the Xbox One and DS4 controller. I use a 360 gamepad personally. That will more be a matter of preference and comfort overall though.\n\nThe game is set up as a huge map that you battle your way through much like many past fighters, where defeating one area unlocks another one (or two depending on where you are on the map). I've fought probably 200 battles so far (at least) and havent even finished the map yet. So...there is no lack for content. The fight screens are basically the same with minor variants such as retro, thunderstorm, darkness, and so on, that all impact the fights and add a cool diversity to the fight screen. There are a variety of fights...some are horde battles where you fight through 50, 60, 100, even 180 opponents. Some are smash battles where you knock opponents around until they smash a certain amount of objects.. Some are weapon battles where you are armed with a single type of weapon (sword, dagger, nunchuk, etc...) and have to defeat a horde of enemies using only that weapon. There are boss battles. A lot of the enemies have special moves. Many wield special weapons that you can take from them and use for a limited amount of time. That is just some of the awesome variety.\n\nCertain battles unlock weapons or special abilities that can be put in one of three available slots to take into battle with you. All discharge when certain conditions are met. For example, maybe after killing 90 opponents, you are able to shake the ground killing all the enemies on screen. That is one example of an ability you can unlock, and how it is used in battle.\n\nThe combat system itself is set up to be as user friendly as possible. There are button prompts that you can use to help you in battles. There will be a point where you just gotta use your instincts though due to the speed in which the combat can end up running. In fact, the better you do, the faster your opponents are. However, that said, the game definitely penalizes you for button mashing, so you really end up learning how to fight properly within the system, and once you figure it out, it is completely gratifying and becomes second nature.\n\nDid I mention the graphics? They...look...awesome. For as simplistic as they are, they are really amazing, and the occasional death blow look flat out cool.\n\nI would call this game a must own, possibly the greatest fighter of all time, and maybe even in my personal top 10 games of all time. That is how good this game is. 10 out of 10, and if you could crank it up to 11, then that is where it would be.","July 22, 2014","true","5.5"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","11","13","2","3"

Remember all of those stick figure animations you found that you thought were super cool because they had cool martial arts and ripped off the matrix/Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon every now and then? One Finger Death Punch is pretty much that but in game form.\n\nTwo hands slap fights is a stick figure rythm game based around who I believe is a martial arts master who I could totally beat up.  You go from stage to stage with a variety of martial arts styles that only need two buttons to use. Enemy coming from the left? Press X or click the left mouse button. Enemy coming from the right? Press B or the right mouse button. You are then rewarded with a quick but satisfying animation of your stick figure beating the ever loving hell out of the other stick figures.\n\nThis game surprised me, honestly. It had every opportunity to be super lame. But Two Feet Fury Dance managed to surprise and delight me at the same time, like finding a almost complete sandwich in a trash bin, or a loose dollar on a strip club floor. Instead of having you simply punch or kick or throw your enemies around with the press of the button, you instead recieve a very flash very brutal looking attack that can send enemies flying in all directions. Add this together with weapons, power ups, and special enemy types and you have a game that will keep you on your toes like you're from Detroit.\n\nWith all the stages and special stages and difficulty levels, there is also a speed modifier that goes up depending on how well you do. It will never drop under 100% and it can go anywhere from fast, to super fast, to "What the ♥♥♥♥ have you done?" fast. And with this being a rythme game and all, this can either make or break a round for you.\n\nBut, should you play Four Toe Power Suplex? Probably, it's not like it's really all that expensive. The game will drop achievements on you like Snoop Animal drops hot things, and it's just simple enough that you can come back to it at any time and still remember how to play and what you were doing.\n\nI give Six Hand Relaxing Massage 16 Chinese Martial Arts B movies out of a total of 5.\n\nThe movie that Kung Pow dubbed over is called "Tiger and Crane Fist".\n\nThe Curator: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Dickbuttexperience#curation","January 2, 2015","true","4.7"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","76","13","17","8","1"

Best played with a controller.  Steady, fair learning curve that doesn't hinder you from progressing if you're not the greatest at this, but also has oodles of replayability.\n\nMy only gripe is that occasionally the UI seems to update just a split second before the character models get into attack range, leading to useless misses even though the game says the enemy was in-range.The weapons, which are meant to help you, have unpredictable effects that can hinder you just as easily.  I can't tell you how many times my character has instantly thrown a weapon, killing every character onscreen, instead of picking the weapon up and fighitng with it like I anticipated.  This leads to countless flubbed combos and unfair damage.\n\nAll that said, when you're in the flow of things, this game makes you feel like a god, and there aren't many games you can get that lost in, especially for such a low file size and price.","June 30, 2014","true","8.9"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/geoluz/recommended/264200/","geoluz","GeoLuz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/geoluz/","180 products in account","This game seems to be inspired by Kung-Fu films. You first learn to use the incredibly simple mechanics of martial arts choreography which requires only a mouse. There is no keyboard to consider for any part of the game. It is all about learning how to use the left and right mouse buttons as a stick figured man fight other stick figured people, usually gray in color. This is what I would call an easy game to learn, but hard to master. It requires plenty of practice and there are enough levels that would encourage you to practice a lot.\n\nYou begin in the middle of the map fighting stick figured enemies left and right. The commands of when to hit either the left or right mouse button appear at the below you and feel like musical notes that you must hit accurately in order to KO your opponents. Pressing the left mouse button will result in a quick kick and your character will move to the left automatically. There are some enemies, however, who will require several successive hits to bring them down. They tend to be stick figured non-gray colored enemies who may be colored green, brown, yellow, or pink. This is when your martial arts abilities are truly tested. You will view commands to hit those enemies a few times before they suddenly jump to the other side and you will view more commands to hit them a few more times, all while they may be striking you. It’s so tricky because one miss may lead to sudden defeat at the hands of the non-gray, more powerful stick figured men. Enemies with crowns over their heads are the most challenging and brutal since they require the most hits and move the fastest.\n\nThe speed of the martial arts combat starts at 100%, but it can increase if you are continuously successful. The speed of the combat can fall below 100% if you are getting knocked out too often. As you move around kicking ♥♥♥, you may find some wood in the environment that you can use to break these enemies in dramatic fashion. In those instances, the game will pause to show the impact of the violence while the screen zooms you in for the greatest animation possible. Other times you will find weapons that you can use to kill the martial arts enemies more quickly. The combat can pause to show you how you impaled an enemy in savage and dramatic fashion. These animation scenes reduce the monotony of each map since each map does not look drastically different than other maps. I found it very satisfying when I threw the bouncing ball left and right to mow down all opponents in quick succession regardless of their strength.\n\nThe number of maps in this game is enormous at around 250. As you progress, you can acquire skills that you can activate before entering a particular map. Only three skills can be activated at once and there are some maps that do not allow you to use any skills since they require special challenges. Some maps, known as defender rounds, require you to defend yourself against knives and one hit will end your game.\n\nThere are medals awarded at the end of each level. Medals are awarded according to how many times you missed when striking your opponents. Medals come in platinum, gold, silver, and bronze. Platinum is the highest medal because you earn it only if you have no misses by the end of the map. No medal is earned if you complete a map with more than ten misses. Some maps that are mob rounds require you to defeat long lines of stick figured opponents in a limited period of time. This requires plenty of dexterity and very accurate timing to complete mob rounds in time. Other maps require you to fight a few rounds, with each round being faster than the previous. All rounds have to be completed without losing a life.\n\nSimply mashing buttons randomly and violently will not be enough because timing and muscle memory will be important to victory in each map. The narrator of the game sounds like a man with a heavy Asian accent. He sounds campy when providing you instructions on how to use your martial arts talents and when he provides encouragement when you die. His campy voice adds entertainment value to the game.\n\nI think One Finger Death Punch provides enough action, challenges, and entertainment value that would justify spending $5. It can eventually feel monotonous and repetitive to some players, but you can get more out of this game for $5 than you can get out of some games costing at least $20. It is easy to get into the game and learn how hone your martial arts skills, but be prepared to practice a lot if you want to master it.\n\nMy Score: 8/10\n","June 26, 2015","true","29.2"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","8","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ErickaUnlimited/recommended/264200/","ErickaUnlimited","💝💝ErickaUnlimited💝💝","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ErickaUnlimited/","777 products in account","Overview\nOne Finger Death Punch is a 2D fighting game by Silver Dollar games, originally being released for the XBOX360 in 2013 before making its way to the PC.\n\nOne Finger Death Punch puts the player against rounds of enemies called "Mob Rounds" in game. The rounds differ in the size of waves, difficulty of enemies and various other premises, such as hit combos, weapon drops, changeable abilities, specialized rounds and boss battles. Fighting can be done with a simple two button configuration, one button corresponding left and the other to the right. Your mission is to defeat all the enemies before your health is depleted. You must hit the buttons in sequence to avoid taking damage. Each time you miss a button, or push the wrong one, the enemy will hit you.\n\nDespite only needing two buttons, , One Finger Death Punch supports both keyboard/mouse or controllers depending on your preference.\n\nThe game has two modes: the main story and survival mode. The main campaign consists of ever-increasing rounds of enemies and, on occasion, different requirements depending on the level. Some examples of those requirements include: light sword battles, timed battles, boss fights, lightening rounds and more. Survival mode is just that: survive. The waves never stop until you're eventually defeated. Survival is broken up into three sub-categories: Regular, Blind and "No Luca No". The regular mode plays much like the main campaign, blind removes the hit indicators on the bottom of all enemies except those that have unique combos and "No Luca No" is regular, but you must swat away a black cat named "Luca" from blocking your screen. In all three modes, the speed at which the enemies come slowly increases as time goes by. There are also three difficulty modes both in story mode and in survival mode; student, master and grandmaster.\n\nAs you traverse the main campaign, you'll unlock useful abilities, such as the ability to slow down enemies, earn health, extend the use of weapons...etc. You may select any three abilities at any given time and you can switch them before each level if you so desire. There is no penalty for changing abilities.\n\nOne Finger Death Punch doesn't offer much more than that. It's a very straight forward game, but does the job well. It's simple in design, but offers quite a challenge for those looking to play on some of the harder difficulties. What I will say is that I'm not a huge fan of most fighting games, 2D or 3D, but I really loved this one. It feels very smooth, the combos, weaponry, and abilities fit seamlessly into what you're doing so there's not much need to stop and think about what to do next, which is good since there is very little time to do so. The game never felt like I lost due to cheap hits and could really tell when my skills were improving and that was the most enjoyable part for me.\n\n\nPros\nVisuals (both combat & background) are well done.\nCombat movement is fluid and precise, even though you're fighting a bunch of stick figures.\nController support. I always played with one and it always worked fine. I used an XBOX & Logitech controller.\nAdjustable abilities to cater towards personal play styles.\nCons\nRepetitive - The game can feel a bit "samey" after longer playthroughs, both in combat and in level design.\nAchievements - There are a ton and they are extremely grind heavy and difficult for those who hunt achievements.\n\nOverall, One Finger Death Punch is a great title. I enjoyed all the stick-on-stick violence and found it a nice game to blow off some steam or just to lose myself in for a little while. If you like 2D fighters, stick figures, or both, I recommend checking it out. It's a blast.","April 6","true","21.0"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","2"

One Finger Death Punch is, very simply, amazing. While many might laugh at the simplicity they see on the surface, it has more depth and content than some games I've paid $60 or more for. At the surface, you clear stages by punching, brawling, shooting, blowing up, and impaling bad guys. Look a little further in, and you'll see around a dozen different modes that twist this format, including a Speed Round, where not only perfection and reflex are needed, but also a little bit of memorization of the most efficient click pattern. That, alongside a Thunderstorm mode, which colors out all the enemies, leaving you to look at the bars on the bottom for the right hitpatterns, and the god-mode Light Sword and Light Nunchaku rounds, which are some of the most fun I've had in a game in years. Not to mention the skill system which grants you amazing perks for longevity, ultility, or just to be even more of an offensive badass.\nAnd what's the best part? It's only $5. This game is so cheap, that it deserves a purchase, and even if for some reason, you end up not liking it, well, you're only out $5. But, as if you wouldn't like this. If you enjoy fast-paced action, simplistic art, beautifully responsive controls, references galore, an actually challenging game, feeling like a god, or just having fun, this game deserves to be in your library. And if you don't? Well, then there's just no pleasing you, is there?","May 22, 2014","true","11.5"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","7","7","0","0"

For a casual gamer there is enough wow moments to enjoy for a few hours until you get bored of it. For the more hardcore gamer, the difficulty scales up very high and for the most part the game rewards your skill.\n\nBut some rough edges cause frustration - the bouncing weapons which sometimes bounce through enemies without killing them, yet bounce over them and do kill them. Or the game going from ludicrous speed to slow motion when scenery is smashed, then back to ludicrous speed all in a heart beat. Or the dynamic difficulty which oscillates between too hard and too easy without settling on the sweet spot. Or the way that the pointless "Godly Combo" messages get displayed over the top of critical information showing the attack pattern of that enemy you are fighting. Or the way occasionally a stickman gets thrown at the screen obscuring your view once again. Sure all these things make the game more difficult, but they seem like the developer choosing style over substance more than considered gameplay design.\n\nWhen all is said and done though, even with some flaws - it costs less than a cup of coffee, gets you just as hyped up and satisfies much longer.","December 19, 2014","true","61.6"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","9","11","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/neema_t/recommended/264200/","neema_t","neema_t","http://steamcommunity.com/id/neema_t/","763 products in account","This is one of those games that makes it hard for you to tell if you're good, or if it's good at making you think you're good. Either way, it's immensely satisfying in short sessions. You'd think a game with only two inputs would get boring quickly, but it just keeps adding familiar-yet-different things at you so you find yourself having to remember the significance of various different things and then you have to figure out how to work all that into the sequence so nailing a later stage (oh yeah, I've only played through the, er, "story" mode) without missing and without being hit is satisfaction on a par with Super Hexagon. The different objectives are fun - Nunchuck and light sword rounds are so, so great - and the way it scales the speed depending on how well you're doing is a nice touch.\n\nI don't like that it can get confusing with regards to what your stick guy will do next; you can pick up throwable weapons and I sometimes don't realise that my next move will throw a ranged weapon instead of a short-range strike, so I quite often waste the ranged ability. Also, enemies can throw weapons at you that can get hidden behind masses of other enemies - in other words, it's a visually busy game and at higher speeds it can get very difficult to keep track of what's actually happening. Normal enemies are fine, very bright and visible against the background, but I think certain other elements could perhaps be indicated a little better, but then again maybe I'm just old and slow.\n\nFor the price of beer you can't really go wrong, though. Don't laugh but I wouldn't mind a Mac version, this would be a great lightweight laptop game.","April 26, 2015","true","8.8"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","77","10","13","3","0"

Well, let me tell you... This game is freakin' awesome ! It's also a really basic game with just enough depth and variation to keep things interesting for at least a couple of hours.\n\nYou control a stick figure that's centered on the screen. Enemies will come from your left and right, at a certain speed, and with the press of one button you can kill them pretty much instantly. The better you play, the faster the enemies will come at you. So it adjusts to your own skill. That's just brilliant if you ask me.\n\nLater levels will introduce other enemies, like bosses, enemies that require a combination of button presses or enemies that throw weapons at you. Later levels will also give you new missions/objectives instead of just hitting incoming enemies. Ok, I lied there. I think there's just one mission (maybe two) that doesn't make you kill enemies.\n\nBut why change a winning formula ? If killing enemies feels to good, then why on earth would you even want to change that, right ?\n\nOne Finger Death Punch deserves your money and it deserves it fast.\n\n[Rating: 84/100]","March 29, 2014","true","8.5"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

However, some enemies won't diewith one hit; they require multiple sequence hits. So, for example, there are enemies which force you to hit right-left in sequence, others left-right-right-left, others left-right-left, and other ones are just single hit fodder. You got it? Easy mechanics. There are brawlers too, which requiere more than that.\n\nGame looks simple but is very addictive. The difficult of the game varies depending on your performance, so if you are good, enemies move faster and if you are bad, enemies move slow. Add to that multiple skills, different weapons that you can use for limited time —for example, bows that shoot arrows that one-kill even brawlers, bombs, daggers, and so on—, 2 game modes —normal or survival— and even 3 difficulties for each one of them.\n\nOnly negative for me is that I think this game is a mouse-killer, I don't recommend to play it with your 80$ pro gamer mouse. Try one 5$ one for this game :)\n\n\nVery addictive game. Maybe not for everyone; if you are thinking about buying it, it's better if you like reflex fast paced games. Highly recommended game though.

I used to treat 30 hours for 40-50 euro game as standard for "money well spent". Enjoymen/euro is strong in this one. It doesn't come without flaws (or rather rough edges) and it isn't a game everyone will like.\nIf you like stickfight videos/games and want a test for your reflexes, this game might be for you.\n\nIf you don't have idea what this game is actually about, go watch some videos. Basically it's a 2D action game with 2 buttons.\n\nGenerally The Good:\n-This game excels at making the player better at the game.\nThe different rounds are diverse enough to inerhetly practice different things (like reflexes to choose nearest target when you get knife etc.) and if you are good enough, the speed multiplier goes up. It automatically becomes as challenging as possible without feeling impossible (except few cases, covered elsewhere).\n\n-This game has enough randomness to keep the player on his/her toes.\nYou can never guess what weapons or enemy types will spawn next, you always have to adapt. Even your own abilities that affect enemies immediately can keep you guessing (examples are freezing touch which freezes one side and Grey Out which instantly transfers every enemy to grey one for 10 seconds) since they activate on set kill count. You don't have the time to look at skill killcount at higher speeds (this is a good and a bad thing, however you want to look at it).\n\n-This game is simple. (But diverse)\nThere are just two buttons. But those two buttons have been "stretched" very far and very well. This also makes it fun to watch, especially on bigger screen, since you don't need anything other than few lines of conversation to know exactly what's going on.\n\n-It has enough content on initial playthrough on easiest difficulty to be considered a proper game.\nThough the sheer amount of levels may be discouraging at first, none of the levels feel truly meaningless. At least I felt I got gradually better and every level was slightly harder. There are also 21 skills scattered across the map and multiple route possibilities for you to choose. A little rusty, haven't played in a while? Play some earlier maps you hadn't played before, before moving on where you left off last time.\n\nThe Grey area:\n-I need to write specific paragraph about Light Sword and nunchacu rounds.\n-(They're basically levels where enemies come faster, but are always one hit enemies. You also have unbreakable weapon, giving extended range. At the end of level you get longer lasting brawled.)\n-Simply put: They're harder than normal levels. If I had to describe the "level difference", I'd say it's unfair. This difference doesn't, or shouldn't, show at earlier and middle levels, but especially the final three levels of this kind are far above other level types. You usually need to practice without progressing to clear these rounds. It's not tedious, but it differs from rest of the game.\n-How much are you willing to challenge yourself? Given that you've chosen to play this game to it's "end", the extra challenge shouldn't be discouraging.\n-I personally had hoped they would put this kind of "jump" in level to next difficulty.\n-Another problem with these levels is with the skill making brawlers easier. But as you might know, skills don't work in Light Sword/Nunchaku round. It's quite a leap from slower brawlers to inerhetly faster brawler without the slow. It just makes the skill counterproductive and "jump" even more unfair-feeling.\n\nI do like the round type though. The problem is in allocating the difficulty.\n\nGenerally The Bad:\nAll of these things are just unpolished details, but easily fixed bad experiences.\n\n-Combos wont extend with slows. This is mainly for faster speeds, when impossible combos become more frequent.\nSlow from smashing things is just... Stupid. It doesn't have a purpose. I wouldn't mind it if it had no negative sides. It's another randomizer, after all.\n"Special move"s should only happen when you have enemies near you. Why would you need slow when you just killed last enemy on screen? (Doesn't include Power Smash)\nI get it that this is to make the game equally random, not just in some situations.\n\n-Throwing mace(s).\nJust no. There's no way of telling whether that thing will hit anything, even when it "connects".\nAt faster speeds it creates situations where enemy first out of range, then when enemy is in range you would miss if the currently flying mace does hit it then mace goes partially through the enemy and you get hit. Even without this, if mace hits 4+ times, the situation gets exponentially more confusing. You kind of want to take action and even if that action will seem right, mace will be there to tell you to get it. Which you will. :(\n\nThere are few solutions for this: Extend the slow to when mace is done flying, make it hit max 3 times (like spear/pole) or make player hits ALWAYS connect before the mace, no matter how late the attack is inputted. You could also make the mace faster.\nCurrently I don't want to throw a mace. Even with four 4-hit enemies near me I wouldn't want to throw a mace.\nSword is the best thing ever, though.\n\n-Ranged weapons and inconsistent slow (Bomb, knife, bow)\nSometimes you need to very close enemy with ranged weapon and there's an enemy right behind him. Normally you could just punch and get slowmo' for few moments, but with ranged weapons (and with brain expecting consistency) you'll probably get hit instead. This is only major issue when you get 2 ranged weapons from one guy, since with one wepons the initial kill slow is enough to plan the use and connecting the next punch. With 2 ranged weapons you suddenly need to make correct key presses up to three times as fast as usual.\nRanged weapons make you have to react faster on short notice, for not getting close distance slows.\n\n-Sometimes dies\nInconsistently, the program stops working and needs to be restarted. I believe it's an issue related to repeatedly returning to map and repeating same level few time. Thankfully this game has autosave, but it may make you rage if it kills your epic survival run.\n\n\nClosing words and veredict:\nI enjoyed it. You could too. I wrote this after clearing grandmaster and 0-miss perfecting all student level.\nI apologize for bad english and typos in this review.\nI hope this review helped you make either make desicion about this game, stir your thoughts about it's contents or just entertain yourself with my horrible opinions.\n\nI'd rate it 8/10 if I had to. It excels at what it tries to be and has some rough edges. If you're looking for a fun challenge, this'll keep you entertained for quite a while.","June 18, 2014","true","43.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","1"

The premise is simple, when you begin a round your character has a pre-set fighting style, sets the boundarys, and then you click right and left mouse button to attack anything within range.  Sounds dull and boring right?\n\nWrong, there are so many really cool things in play, like, weapon pickups to extend range (And a wide veriaty of weapons), skills to change how you fight, enemies that dodge, brawlers that require QTE's to beat.\n\nWell even at that the levels would get boring right?\n\nWrong again!  It's not the same level, multi-rounds, smash rounds (Where you have to smash items), Time rounds, Thunderstorm rounds, Retro film rounds, boss rounds, and Nunchuku and Light Sabe... I mean Light sword rounds which make you feel like an Epic Bad@ss.\n\nThis game is awesome, replayabiliy is high, alot of content for what it is, you should buy it if you haven't, regardless of the price.","July 25, 2014","true","11.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

It brings back the air of the Xiao Xiao Series from stickpage.com. Stick games aren't much popular nowadays but One Finger Death Punch offers a simple and easy way to recall those stick games of the old. Using just two buttons to play, even a total amateur can actually play and enjoy this game. The game starts with your stick warrior/martial artist standing in the middle of the screen and you try to take down all the enemies that come from both sides. The game features a lot of powerups that you can equip and experiment with depending on the fighting style you like. It also includes two types of game modes: Story mode and Survival mode. The game replayability is very high since you have to go through the same challenges in a different difficulty as the story mode features 3 difficulties: Student, Master and Grandmaster. The Survival mode is also the same with Survival Mode, Blind Survival Mode and No Luca No Survival Mode difficulties.\n\nOne Finger Death Punch also includes different types of battle rounds and not just the typical mob round where you fight incoming enemies that spawn from both sides but I'll let you discover those on your own.\n\nI highly recommend One Finger Death Punch to those who are fans of stick game and to those who are looking for casual arcade games that involve button press timings. If you're a button masher type of player then this is not for you since the game features an anti-button mashing rule. This is also not for you if you care a lot for your achievement % progress because the game has 100+ achievements and some of them are near to impossible to achieve at all. I also recommend that you buy this game either during a sale or if you have the game's 50% coupon. It's a fun and a MUST try game. Relive the stickman games of the old with One Finger Death Punch!\n\nPersonal Rating:Gameplay: 9/10\nGraphics: 7/10\nMusic: 8/10\nStory/Plot: 5/10\n\nOverall: 7/10","September 6, 2015","true","5.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

Regardless of the fact that your placement on the screen is fairly stationary (you do move, of course, as a result of butt kicking), this game is really fast paced, but it also adjusts to your skill level. Having a tough time keeping up? The speed at which baddies come at you decreases until you are victorious in your Kung fu! There are different stages which challenge you in different ways. My favorite might be the light saber rounds. My least favorite are the black and white ones, where the color indicators on your baddies are nullified.\n\nAll in all, a great casual game that requires focus but not a ton of thought.

Four weeks later I have 41 hours clocked in and no sign of that slowing down any time soon.  While it might look like a brawler, it plays more akin to a rhythm-based game on steroids.\n\nThis is a casual game at its best.  There is a multitude of levels and a seemingly endless variety of skill combinations to tweak the experience.  You can play a level or two in five minutes or play for an hour or two and wonder where the time went.  Skill combinations that work on easier levels don't work on the more insane levels, and likewise strategies for the more difficult levels are kinda useless on easier levels.  You might find a strategy that works for you for large portions of the game but you will have to alter it later on as things get faster.\n\nWhen I wake up in the morning and put a pot of coffee on to brew, I'll play a level quick and the game's intense enough that that will wake me up fully before the coffee is even ready.  The response system between clicking the mouse and the action on the screen is perfect and you are only limited by your ability to click the mouse.  I was plateauing fairly early into the grandmaster levels when my gamer son explained to me you can click faster by arching your hand in a claw grip instead of resting your hand flat on the mouse.  It took a little while to acclimate to using the mouse in this way and I still alternate between the two grips, but when the game starts getting insane, the claw grip really does make a world of difference.\n\n\nLike I said, I'd seen the ads for One Finger Death Punch and never paid any attention to the game.  Skyrim or DayZ or RockBand or Tomb Raider whatnot, that's the sort of stuff I pay attention to.  Didn't care that the game lists at $5, it's just not he sort of game I'd expect to be interested in.  Now that I've played OFDP, the amount of replayability and sheer fun I've had with this game, I could've spent $20-30 on this game and still felt like it was money well spent.","May 10, 2015","true","196.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I added it to my library to play later and then forgot about it.\n\nLately I had been looking for a meaty beat'em up or sword-swinging game.  Something that rewarded timing and let you punish your enemies, but with more satisfaction than the Arkham series provided.  Something without stupid amounts of idiotic cutscenes to ruin the flow like "Killer is Dead".\n\nLittle did I know, the answer was in fact "One Finger Death Punch".  No idiotic story, no stupid cut scenes, just frantic, precision and timing that had the flow of a deep combo system without the complexity.  Despite the simplicity, it had plenty of nice touches like high-impact smashes that were enjoyable despite being random because they gave me a little breather.  Plus there was a variety in stages and the skill selection really did change everything.\n\nBut more important than anything else, it rewarded timing and precision like a good beat-em up did but delivered it at a much higher pace and there was always a strong need to have that perfect round.\n\nThe fact that the developers are just so darn grateful that the game was a success and kept showing their appreciation all the way through the game in the form of 'hints'... well, that just gave me a nice little fuzzy feeling.","January 8","true","40.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Two buttons is all it has, but two buttons is all you need to lay waste with style!\n\nTo break it down:\nThe action can change up from slowly trundling enemies at you one at a time from either the left or right side of the screen. Once they get close enough, you click either the left mouse button or the right mouse button (or relevant button you are using) to attack the left or right side of your character respectively. Basic enemies go down with one hit, the animation of which seems to vary depending on the combat style used in the stage and the current combo your character is in. Tougher enemies are not simply enemies that take more hits, but also ones that dodge after the first hit, moving to the other side of your character, or the enemies that fight you one-on-one in a cool fast-paced fight after which the  other enemies come at you again.\nWeapons drop pretty frequently and are often literally thrown at your character, forcing you to either become a pin cusion or deflect those blades like a badass as they get near. Getting hold of a weapon makes your character either begin pummelling enemies with it until it breaks, or throw it at your enemies for ranged attacks.\nCompleting certain stages unlocks powerups, of which you can initially slot three at a time. These give you advantages such as three shots with dropped ranged weapons instead of one, extended melee range or even a freezing blast that turns enemies into even more decor to destroy.\n\nPros:\nFast-paced  - Keeps things intense and fun. There's nothing quite like pulling off an epic combo and finishing with style!\n\nEasy to learn, difficult to master - You seriously cannot go wrong with two buttons. But you also cannot simply button mash, as you will die pretty fast if you do so. Easy to pick up and play.\n\nShort, varied levels (and lots of them!) - Short levels means you can pick up and play this anytime, you never feel like you are doing the same things over and over and the variation of the levels is interesting enough to keep things fresh throughout.\n\nStick men - Stick man fighting is an old concept, but a fun one!\n\nCons:\nArt style - I'd actually say the art style is great, but sometimes it feels a little unpolished with the animations, which, for such a simple yet in-depth game, is a real shame but does nothing to detract from the fun.\n\nOne more level! - Could possibly loose more time to this than expected... the levels are short so "one more level!" doesn't seem as dangerous! xD\n\nAdapting - Button mashers aside, people might still have trouble keeping on time with some of the features, missing once because of something random you didn't expect can be frustrating. (not had this problem much except when a combo unexpectedly wipes out too many enemies... yes, I said too many).","March 10, 2014","true","7.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Don't let the fast paced action fool you into thinking this is some mash to win affair, mashing will only get you killed quicker. This game reminded me a lot of the combat system in the Batman Arkham series, albeit simplified and striped down to its core then applied to a 2 button mouse.\nAlso I got a little hint of Kung Fu Master (arcade, NES) and that fight scene from Old boy.\nThe visuals match the simple controls with slo-mo, special effects and a camera that zooms in to 1 on 1 fights with mini bosses adding some flare to the side on 2D view.\nThe sounds are straight out of those classic kung fu flicks, loads of kiai screaming, hearts ripped out of chests sound like hearts getting ripped out of chests should.\n\nEven though this is a 2 button game, I did find the control scheme slightly awkward at first, after a few rounds of the early story mode levels OFDP's basic and some finer details clicked with me. This is one of those 'in the zone' games, where you know what needs done and you'll do it without thinking.\n\nSpecial shout-out to 'the ball'. Now one of my favourite power ups from any game.\n\nOverall, a very satisfying title with a huge story mode map and the endless challenge of survival modes. Fun for a quick 10 minute time waster, I've had a lot of entertainment hot seating this game with friends and there is enough content and variation in the gameplay to keep you curious to see what is waiting on the next stage.\nAny fans of kung fu should give this one a go, same goes for people who like Divekick or weird little indie games.","June 23, 2014","true","16.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

Unfortunately this one is not good. Its GREAT! From the first hit of the button it was instant addiction and the action get so good at times that you can get lost. This game is all about finness. Meaning if you press a button too many times, not enough times, or not at all, it is game over man! Then throw in some weapons and it becomes coorindated chaos. I've gotta make this review short so that I can get back to playing but even at $4.99 this game is worth every penny. Passing this one on sale is not a good idea. Why you ask? Well if you end up paying full price you'll banging your head against the keyboard for now buying it earlier and when it was cheaper. I'd give this a 9/10 , -1 for the moderately weak graphic design.

Four weeks later I have 41 hours clocked in and no sign of that slowing down any time soon.  While it might look like a brawler, it plays more akin to a rhythm-based game on steroids.\n\nThis is a casual game at its best.  There is a multitude of levels and a seemingly endless variety of skill combinations to tweak the experience.  You can play a level or two in five minutes or play for an hour or two and wonder where the time went.  Skill combinations that work on easier levels don't work on the more insane levels, and likewise strategies for the more difficult levels are kinda useless on easier levels.  You might find a strategy that works for you for large portions of the game but you will have to alter it later on as things get faster.\n\nWhen I wake up in the morning and put a pot of coffee on to brew, I'll play a level quick and the game's intense enough that that will wake me up fully before the coffee is even ready.  The response system between clicking the mouse and the action on the screen is perfect and you are only limited by your ability to click the mouse.  I was plateauing fairly early into the grandmaster levels when my gamer son explained to me you can click faster by arching your hand in a claw grip instead of resting your hand flat on the mouse.  It took a little while to acclimate to using the mouse in this way and I still alternate between the two grips, but when the game starts getting insane, the claw grip really does make a world of difference.\n\n\nLike I said, I'd seen the ads for One Finger Death Punch and never paid any attention to the game.  Skyrim or DayZ or RockBand or Tomb Raider whatnot, that's the sort of stuff I pay attention to.  Didn't care that the game lists at $5, it's just not he sort of game I'd expect to be interested in.  Now that I've played OFDP, the amount of replayability and sheer fun I've had with this game, I could've spent $20-30 on this game and still felt like it was money well spent.","May 10, 2015","true","196.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

This game does not get any more simple and straight to the point with the controls; literally only two buttons to perform bad-butt gameplay. Either left and right on the arrow keys or left and right click. The contrls are so crisp and on point, you feel them react to your pressing of the buttons. It feels like something you actually did yourself, rather than feeling like the game did it for you. You feel so rewarded for executing the long string of combos, and you feel brutally punished if you ruin your streak with a small and simple mistake. The game does not encourage button mashing, as this will actually get you killed. You have to react to the rate at which enemies are rushing you.\n\nDO NOT MISTAKE THIS FOR A RHYTHM GAME (rhythm games like Guitar Hero, Rock Band, Tap Tap, etc.)\n\nThough the game literally runs on two buttons, don't think for a second you will not be provided with a challenge. Difficulty adapts to player skill, no choosing between easy, normal, hard, etc.- meaning (straight up) if you suck, the difficulty will lower to help you out. If you're completely ripping through enemies, the difficulty gradually increases. So if you're completely pro, goodluck with keeping up with your own skill, as the game literally throws itself at you as you compete with your own skill. If you're finding yourself to not be the best, no worries! The game will slow down for you. Everyone wins when playing this game, being provided with the challenge they need.\n\nThe game may feel repetitive after a few levels, but the fun comes back when you run into a different stage type. There are two game types: "campaign" and survival mode. The campaign mode is loaded with over 250 levels and 13 different stage fights consisting of using lightsabers, nunchucks, 1-on-1 boss fights, speed levels, and more.\nThankfully you're allowed to go back to previous levels if you feel you can improve and get a higher score.\nThroughout the campaign, you have chances to beat certain levels to unlock skills that will help you rip through enemies in creative ways.\n\nIn conclusion; overall, One Finger Death Punch delivers a fast, challenging, compelling combat experience in the most simple way possible. The game can be played by really anyone. I tested it and allowed a few of my friends to try it and they loved it. Besides, who doesn't love some great stick-figure fighting action?\n\nRECOMMENDED TO MAKE YOUR OWN Bruce Lee "WATAAA" sound after every punch to add to experience.\n\n+ simple controls to deliver brutal combos\n+ loaded with levels and achievements\n+ great music to match the mood\n+ SUPER cheesy to add to the fun\n+ stick men, come on.\n\n- gradually becomes repetitive, but this can easily be fixed with how you play\n\nThe game is damn good. These are the kinds of games that prove you dont need breath taking graphics, music, story, personality, all the other stuff dorks argue over these days. Any one can play the game! I feel so grateful I was given this game on a discount.","April 28, 2014","true","3.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Such a simple mechanic in this game, but with flawless execution.\n\nIf you like intense, fast-paced action with only two actions keys (left and right mouse click), then you will love this game.\n\nThe aesthetics are fantastic! The character art may just be stick figures, but the different fighting styles and choreography is absolutely amazing. The gore is pretty good, and it even goes into slow-motion x-ray killcams every now and then (with eyeballs flying toward the screen). While you fight, your opponents will fly into and destroy the environment - for example, an enemy may be thrown into the pillar of a building, causing it to collapse. The music and sounds are great and add to the fast-paced, gameplay.\n\nThe controls are extremely simple - simply click the left or right mouse button depending on which direction your opponent is coming from. You have to time your clicks correctly, clicking only when an enemy is within your radius (indicated by gauges to the left and right). Misclicking will result in a "miss" against, and most likely a counterattack. The learning curve is minimal, however, the game gets progressively challenging, keeping you interested and engaged. The speed that enemies rush toward you increases progressively. Furthermore, you can get a "perfect" score by hitting everyone and not taking any damage; you can also get a platinum badge for each level by not missing for the entire match. Honestly, this part stresses me out because I have spent several minutes replaying the same level over and over trying to get 100% on it.\n\nThe narration is funny, however, the first few levels have tutorials in the beginning and cannot be skipped - so you will have to click through them over and over if you happen to restart.\n\nAs you play, you will unlock passive skills (like getting 3 daggers instead of 1 when you defeat an armed opponent), indicated by icons above each level.\n\nDuring a level, enemies with special weapons will drop them when defeated, and you can pick them up for immediate (short-lifespan) use. The swords extend your accepted range for clicking, and the daggers/bows kill at any range.\n\nThe boss levels are fun and challenging, your opponent will constantly dodge left and right, forcing you to follow and click quickly or risk taking damage (missing out on your 100% level completion).\n\nA fun, refreshing game. Pick it up if you are interested at all.\n\nDefinitely recommend.","July 30, 2014","true","2.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Such a simple mechanic in this game, but with flawless execution.\n\nIf you like intense, fast-paced action with only two actions keys (left and right mouse click), then you will love this game.\n\nThe aesthetics are fantastic! The character art may just be stick figures, but the different fighting styles and choreography is absolutely amazing. The gore is pretty good, and it even goes into slow-motion x-ray killcams every now and then (with eyeballs flying toward the screen). While you fight, your opponents will fly into and destroy the environment - for example, an enemy may be thrown into the pillar of a building, causing it to collapse. The music and sounds are great and add to the fast-paced, gameplay.\n\nThe controls are extremely simple - simply click the left or right mouse button depending on which direction your opponent is coming from. You have to time your clicks correctly, clicking only when an enemy is within your radius (indicated by gauges to the left and right). Misclicking will result in a "miss" against, and most likely a counterattack. The learning curve is minimal, however, the game gets progressively challenging, keeping you interested and engaged. The speed that enemies rush toward you increases progressively. Furthermore, you can get a "perfect" score by hitting everyone and not taking any damage; you can also get a platinum badge for each level by not missing for the entire match. Honestly, this part stresses me out because I have spent several minutes replaying the same level over and over trying to get 100% on it.\n\nThe narration is funny, however, the first few levels have tutorials in the beginning and cannot be skipped - so you will have to click through them over and over if you happen to restart.\n\nAs you play, you will unlock passive skills (like getting 3 daggers instead of 1 when you defeat an armed opponent), indicated by icons above each level.\n\nDuring a level, enemies with special weapons will drop them when defeated, and you can pick them up for immediate (short-lifespan) use. The swords extend your accepted range for clicking, and the daggers/bows kill at any range.\n\nThe boss levels are fun and challenging, your opponent will constantly dodge left and right, forcing you to follow and click quickly or risk taking damage (missing out on your 100% level completion).\n\nA fun, refreshing game. Pick it up if you are interested at all.\n\nDefinitely recommend.","July 30, 2014","true","2.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I'm unhappy with the game, because for it to truly help gamers, they need an option where a person can have full range of the entire screen, and click right and left. While the limited range of attack has it's purpose. It limits player who need intensity training. I'm dissatisfied with the game due to 3 reasons. 1st you can't set the speed of attack manually, even at later levels. 2nd you can't set the range of attack. 3rd. A lot of the items impede speed training instead of promoting it, for instance the weapons take 1 click to pick up, and 2nd click to strike, randomly dropped weapons then become a hindrance, and can cause a miss due to user not clicking twice or miss due to clicking twice. Weapon pickup system needs to be perfected especially since they have 0 tolerance for hit or miss. It's also crazy that you can get hit 4 times and miss 0 and get more reward. Missing an opponent is worse than being hit by one and frustrating when playing. No reward for killing `99 ppl just consequence for missing one guy then killing him again with the second click.  The miss system seems to me to be flawed.\n'Oh Master Yin punched the air, he loses a point, oh he punched again and killed a man, he gets a point. '\nI do realize the sys is in place to prevent spammers, though more distance or double click instead of single click miss allowances are needed. Bare min just allowing a no enemy weapons option would make me happy. Too many random weapon frustrations when playing. I've enjoyed it though it can be more enjoyable with more options. It should be ez for creators to add more fun options if the creators still exist. Either way it’s a fun cheap game.\n","January 11, 2015","true","18.0"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/recommended/264200/","maudish","Audish","http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/","908 products in account","Holy ♥♥♥♥, this game. I picked it up on a lark and for the rest of the day, every free moment I had was spent slaughtering stickmen. One Finger Death Punch is a two-button fighting game, pitting your kung fu stick guy against hordes of other stick guys. Playable with mouse or controller, your left button attacks to the left, and your right button attacks to the right. That's it. There's no movement, no jumping, no button combos, just two attacks. The trick is that enemies must be close enough to hit when you push the button, otherwise you whiff and leave yourself momentarily open to get hit. With hundreds of marauding stickmen bearing down with you, some requiring multiple hits or juking on you, that can get frantic real fast.\n\nThe beauty of OFDP is how it plays out your simple button presses. Each attack is animated in a different way, forming a ballet of murderous moves when the enemies get dense. There are tons of special attacks that come up as the right circumstances are met, such as power smashing foes through walls, pinning them with knives or arrows stolen from attackers, or impaling your hapless opponent on a fallen weapon. Weapons and passive special abilities can increase your range or set up free combos on groups of enemies, so you always need to be looking for those openings. The pace of the game is enthralling, and once you learn to keep up with it every level becomes a whirlwind of broken spines and flying bodies. It's like a rhythm game where every beat kills a person.\n\nBattles can take a minute or less, so the developers smartly included hundreds upon hundreds of levels and modes to enjoy. The main game has a world map with hundreds of stages across multiple paths, including time attacks, survival rounds, weapon stages using nunchakus and not-lightsabers, boss battles, and sepia-toned retro film battles. Some paths unlock new passive skills as well, such as longer weapon durations and free hits. There are three difficulties on top of that, and a host of survival modes to challenge as well. Of particular note is a genius difficulty system that adjusts as you play: Every time you win a battle, the game's pace increases slightly, and when you lose it drops back down. There's no incentive to keeping the pace high, it just keeps the game at a difficulty appropriate to you.\n\nI really cannot stress enough how viscerally fun it is to murder hundreds of stick dudes, and the vast amount of stages and modes to murder them in makes this an ideal package. Games like One Finger Death Punch deserve special recognition for creating a simple, enjoyable gameplay concept, and then giving you nigh-infinite permutations of it. If you like fast-paced action you're sure to love this, and there's enough to love to keep you busy for weeks on end.","January 23","true","9.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

When I first saw this game I was thinking it was going to be a massive button smasher, but one of the first things the game says is that if you button mash you will die.  This is so true. As you play the game the difficulty gets progressively harder with not only the difficulty of certain enemies but with an indicator that either speeds up the attackers or slows them down based off how well you are doing.  The more you succeed the faster the attackers attack and also the more you fail the slower the attackers come at you. At first this sounded to be a hand holding method, but it is quite smooth and is very noticeable when you go from a very easy level to a much harder level. I would have a much faster speed from dominating the easier level and then get dominated from the harder levels.  Another plus about this game is that it is a very friendly to a lower end PC. Works just fine on my 7 year old laptop. However the only real complaint is that the over world used to the basic adventure portion of the game is a little hard to get used to. It is slightly difficult to be able to move from level to level. This is only a small draw back due to the fact that it is quickly forgotten when you are very satisfactory decimating many stick figures with amazingly fluid response and in many respects this made me feel like I was the main character.  Great game and hope you are able to enjoy this as much as I did.","January 17, 2015","true","13.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Your video options are full screen or windowed with smaller/larger scales.  There are no sound options.  You can't adjust keyboard/mouse/controller bindings.  Navigating the game's map to select your "mission" (for lack of a better word) requires you to use your mouse.  I personally prefer to use the left and right arrows to play this game, and moving my hand to and from the mouse can be annoying, especially during the multi-match "missions."\n\nPOSITIVES:\nGameplay is absolutely outstanding!  The graphics are very impressive for a brawler.  The effects are very well crafted.  The game zooms in for finishers (which slow the game pace, but not enough to really bother you during your slaughter-fest), almong other special effects which do other small things you'll enjoy.  The game is EXTREMELY responsive to your commands (which is a must for a brawler like this).  To top all of this off, it's only $5 (I myself picked it up on sale for $4).\n\nOVERALL:\nYou need to own this game.  There are very few games that I sincerely go out of my way to recommend to others.  This title is one of them.  Don't let the negatives put you off from owning this title.  I hope they fix them, but given that this game has such an amazing gameplay, I would not advise you to miss it due to them.\n\nOn a side note:  Look forward to the golden sword.  It's like a scene straight out of a kung fu movie. :D","March 8, 2014","true","11.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

But the way that idea was enacted was very, very well made.\n\nOne finger death punch is a Fast-Paced Action game where enemies come at you from both sides. The enemies are not always the same though. There is the normal gray 1 punch, 1 kill enemies, but there are also colored enemies that will take multiple attacks before they are finally taken down. You have special attacks in a cooldown system which requires you to kill enemies to put them to use. there are also weapons that are occasionally dropped by enemies waiting for them to be picked up or used in a special way. There are sword type weapons that give you extra range to hit enemies, but there are bows and daggers that are ranged attacks, and a ball of death that you punch multiple times to take out enemies. The game is easy to learn but difficult to master.\n\nAs a PC gamer, graphics are important to me, but considering this is an indie dev, I could let a little bit slide. The graphics are definitely far from impressive, everything is 2d figures that contrast from where you are in the game, and all the sprites are just colored stick-figures.

I don't know why the game absolutely refuses to remember the things I tell it, and then it goes and tells me what the light sword round is all about, despite the fact that I've kicked so many asses with that sword that my sword is more ♥♥♥ than sword now. Like the game has perpetual amnesia.\n- Completionist bait re: so many ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ achievements for a game that's just about stoving in the heads of dudes who dare to run blindly towards your fist.\n- Why not call it Two Finger Death Punch? (Nitpicking at this point, time to move on.)\n\nThose are all the reasons I don't recommend it. Here's why I do:\n\n- Round lengths are PERFECT. Not too long, not too short, just right. All you need is a couple of minutes to lay waste to a crowd of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s and at the end you'll feel like you've really accomplished something. It taps into that same bloodlust euphoria that Hotline Miami taps into really well.\n- It gets its sexy so right. The player feedback for punching a dude dead is phenomenal. There's enough variations in the death sequences where you get to see a dude's ribs crack or an eyeball fly or pinning a dude to the ground with your sword to heighten the awesomeness. The tempo the game keeps is ♥♥♥♥ing wonderful.\n- As you get better, the game gets faster, and it keeps challenging you and you have to answer the ♥♥♥♥ing call by being faster and more precise or it shames you by making the game move slower.\n- The ability to one-hit kill bosses with thrown weapons is awesome and I really wish more games would do it more often.\n- The game can make you feel like a badass, but the included No Luca No Survival mode makes this hilarious. This is because in the midst of frenetic kung-fu badass action, the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ cat walks in front of the screen and shoving it away makes The Whiniest Cat Owner In The World whine at his cat, which hits so embarrasingly close to home that it becomes hilarious.\n\nAll of these reasons make my 'No Recommendation' list pale in absolute comparison. Yeah, sure, I really wish there wasn't a narrator at all and the game does things that ♥♥♥♥ me off, but those things are mere hurdles in the way of endlessly satisfying amounts of kicking the asses of dudes. You have to play this and accept the flaws, racist narrators and non-working settings and all. It's worth it.","June 28, 2015","true","3.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

A title with such ridiculously simple gameplay shouldn't be this enjoyable, but the two-man team at Silver Dollar Games really pulled off a thing of genius with One Finger Death Punch. It's pretty much just as simple as pressing the left mouse button to attack left and the right mouse button to attack right, but there's something irresistible about how that mechanic mixes with the visuals to deliver something utterly satisfying and hopelessly addictive. It's been years since I've played a game and said to myself, "Alright, I'll do this level, then quit," only to find myself still playing hours later. If the game has one shortcoming, it's that its visuals leave something to be desired, although I can appreciate that it draws inspiration from the old Xiao Xiao animations. My interest in this game was initially very low, but I'm glad I tried it.

As a gamer, one of the things I love most is the possibility to explore gorgeously designed and rendered worlds with strong aesthetic sensibilities. What I'm trying to say is: I stay the hell away from games that look like One Finger Death Punch.\n\nI'm glad I made an exception and gave it a try, though. REALLY glad. Because disgusting as it looks, it is incredibly fun and addictive to play. The mechanics are simple, but despite only having two buttons to press, you feel very much in control. It also is challenging. And mastering that challenge? Oh, it is just such fun. I found myself immediately replaying levels and trying to go for the best ranking. Additionally, the game does a great job in keeping things fresh and switching them up, expanding on the core gameplay in many different ways - not changing it, but simply taking on it from different perspectives. All throughout, this is a showcase of incredibly clever game design, and looking at Silver Dollar Games' questionable previous game catalogue, I have to wonder if they sold their soul to the devil to accomplish what they have with One Finger Death Punch.\n\nAnd for what it's worth? It's cheesy aesthetics fit what it's trying to do. I think the engrish voiceovers won me over.

Also for people who keep dying the game speed lowers so you can clear the level, the better you keep playing the faster the game gets, which is where the game really shines.

And now we finally got this in Video Game Form.\nThe creators of the videos and this game are not the same,but the idea is very similar. You get a stickfigure to control on the middle of the screen and use the left and right mouse button to smash your opponent on your left or right side. Don't take it easily because you only have two button for the entire game. The strength of this lies in the difficulty to beat those figures. Some of them need more than one hit to go down and can even switch sides, which makes mindless buttonmashing a death sentence.\n\nGameplay\n\nIn general, this game discourages you to just mash the poor button. One Finger Death Punch 01Similar to the Kung Fu Fighting movies some enemies need a complex succession of punches, or in this case 2 cicks left 2 clicks right before ist over. But beware my friend. Some Opponents with more than just 1 HP tend to switch side if you hit them and you could miss if you don't watch carefully and that makes you stunned for a short time and vulnerable for a counterattack. Luckily the devs are good guys and colored the enemies after their movement pattern. Green ones stays on one side no matter how much you hit them, orange ones switch sides after every strike.\nDuring the course of the game you can get abilites like healing or freezing all enemies on one side, which get activated after a certain body count. A nice feature, but you can go through the game even without this. You get these abilities unlocked in adventure mode where you travel the land on a game board to finally meet and beat your master. The board itself contains various challanges you need to win in order to progress. The challenges get a little repitive after a while, especially the standart challenge where just have to beat a certain amount of enemies without special restrictions.\n\n\nOne Finger Death Punch 02The last point in Gameplay I find worth a notice are weapons. It ranges from swords to maces to bows and does nothig more than inreasing your attack range. But if you already hold a weapon and grab another one you can throw the second one like a dealy projectile and hit multiple enemies at once. It's another story with ranged weapons of course. You just stand there and shoot it in the direction you're pressing.\n\n\nMusic & Sound\n\nThe game has several music tracks to offer, depending on which challange you currently take on. Nothing special, but adds a nice atmosphere.\nA far better job at achieving an atmosphere is doing your chinese master who is speaking from beyond your game and explaining part of the menu and the objectives of the challenges, if you want it or not. Which is a little negative aspect on it, because after a dozen times you know how this challenge works and you just want him to shut up.\n\nConclusion\n\nDid you wanted to feel like Bruce Lee or are you just mad at something and want to hurt someone, this is the game for you. For anyone else you have a pretty solid casual game on hand. A simple yet addictive gameplay, interesting challenges, the wish to beat the highscore and over 150 achievement can keep you going for a while. Though it can get frustrating sometimes.\n\n\nIf you want to get a better look at a playthrough of this game just click the link below:\nhttp://youtu.be/vC7w2TVh8jE?list=UUMxIS2guRxfCuJ1gllMecuA\n\nFor more Reviews visit my Blog at:\nhttp://achievementunlockblog.wordpress.com/home/","July 31, 2014","true","20.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I could go on, but you only need to know one thing:\n\nYOU CAN HIT PEOPLE WITH A MASSIVE FISH!!  10/10!\n\nScott Shaw would be proud.\n\nAnyways, this is an extremely fun, twitch-tastic game, obviously reminiscent of the classic Xiao Xiao Flash animations from the earlier days of the internet, where stick figures using martial arts would beat the crap out of each other.  While some of them were games, they were never very long, so this game feels like an epic Xiao Xiao quest!\n\nThe controls are pretty unique, as this game DEMANDS to be played in a certain way.  The game will tell you that button-mashing will not work.  Instead, you're given two buttons (either mouse buttons or a pair of keys on the keyboard) that allow you to attack to the left or the right.  At first, not being able to move may seem limiting, as you wait for bad guys to line up for fist sandwiches, but once you get the hang of how it works, you suddenly understand what they were going for.\n\nWhat they wanted was a game that made you "feel" like a martial arts master, and I think they totally pulled it off quite well.  By having the game be based on timed-inputs, you fall into a zen-like rhythm as you gracefully pound your opponents into gooey bits.  (Of course, then you get over-confident, screw up, and take a sword to the stomach, but you get a fair amount of lives for each level.)  There are few gaming experiences as exhilarating as catching a thrown-blade in mid-air and flinging it back into the throng, slicing them to ribbons.\n\nI admit, at time of writing, that I haven't played very far into the game, so I don't know how they shake up the formula, but I am certainly excited to keep going and see what they have in store.

This game is much more difficult to play in later levels than it may initially appear from screenshots and trailers.\n\nThis game might bring much nostalgia to you if you were around Newgrounds during the days that Xiao Xiao was really popular, because this is very much a spiritual successor to it.\n\nIt has a nice learning curve and is easy to pick up but somewhat difficult to truly master. For completionists out there, you might like the fact that it has a medal system. While it may seem easy to get a platinum medal for the first few missions, the difficulty ramps up with each campaign mission. Here's where my one and only complaint with the game comes from. While it occasionally varies it's many missions up with laser sword, crash, and numchuck missions, after a short while of playing it can feel very samey. Which isn't a bad thing because the game is addictive as all hell, but you might want to play in short bursts for maximum enjoyment.\n\nFor $5? This game is definitely worth it, it's highly entertaining, replayable and very addictive. A survival mode in any game for me is a huge plus and this game has three different kinds of survival modes (Well, technically two, the third one is just regular survival with a giant cat obscuring one side of your screen), one of which tests your game knowledge by taking away all visual cues except for enemy color.

The game is fun.\n\nThe stages which stop you from using skills (nunchuck and lightsaber rounds especially since enemies in those don't even have variation) are boring as get out. Without special skills this game loses the qualities that stop it from becoming mind numbingly repetitive. I think I lose in those stages a lot purely because I zone out from boredom.\n\nMy thoughts during those rounds tend to go something like this:\n"left left right right right right left right left left left left left left left right right right left right right left left left left right right right rght right right wow I've killed about 150 guys and not enjoyed it this is getting boring and repetitive I wonder if --ohshit I died"\n\nWith skills and various weapons the game is still simple but there's variation in the combat enough to keep it stimulating. Whether it's throwing weapons, blasting peopel with ice powers, jumping and shaking the earth to knock everything out... you know. Whatever. It makes it more than repetitively performing one attack the entire round.\n\nTo be fair the first time I saw the light saber it had a moment of sweetness. Mostly just because the first time I saw it it was new and I was wondering what was going to go on. I mean come on; it was a light saber! There was nothing to it really though. The gameplay in that round is numbingly simple - just pure normal attacks. I'd rather be able to just disable the rounds that turn skills off but you can't skip all of them.\n\nI did enjoy most of the game. There are many fighting styles incorporated into this. The game teaches how to play short and sweet at the beginning of any level with something new added with a quick voiceover of what I guess is the sensei. And there are a surprising amount of skills you can find and use in a game that's so simple.\n\nI'd give this a 5/10. It's a simple game. There's clearly effort in it, but ultimately the claim they make (being "We believe being an indie game company means we can focus on gameplay instead of graphics") falls flat on it's face since it lacked much in terms of graphics AND gameplay - especially once skills were removed for half of the stages in the game. To be fair it's not an overdone concept so they aren't exactly borrowing from others.\n\nIn terms of fun I think it definintly has it's moments. Certain stages.","March 20, 2015","true","58.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

When I first saw this game I was thinking it was going to be a massive button smasher, but one of the first things the game says is that if you button mash you will die.  This is so true. As you play the game the difficulty gets progressively harder with not only the difficulty of certain enemies but with an indicator that either speeds up the attackers or slows them down based off how well you are doing.  The more you succeed the faster the attackers attack and also the more you fail the slower the attackers come at you. At first this sounded to be a hand holding method, but it is quite smooth and is very noticeable when you go from a very easy level to a much harder level. I would have a much faster speed from dominating the easier level and then get dominated from the harder levels.  Another plus about this game is that it is a very friendly to a lower end PC. Works just fine on my 7 year old laptop. However the only real complaint is that the over world used to the basic adventure portion of the game is a little hard to get used to. It is slightly difficult to be able to move from level to level. This is only a small draw back due to the fact that it is quickly forgotten when you are very satisfactory decimating many stick figures with amazingly fluid response and in many respects this made me feel like I was the main character.  Great game and hope you are able to enjoy this as much as I did.","January 17, 2015","true","13.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You control a stick figure martial arts master, fighting an onslaught of enemies that appear from the sides of the screen. You only use two buttons, left and right mouse buttons, to attack enemies on the left and right of your character. It sounds simply, but One Finger Death Punch masterfully layers increasingly complex situations until eventually you either die like a punk or stand tall as a totally badass kung fu master.\n\nWith great visual feedback for each hit, a variety of weapons that you can turn against their wielders, and just straight-up solid-feeling gameplay, this is one of those little games you just can’t put down. When in the middle of a fight, chaining together combos and not even seeing the colour-coded hints on which buttons to press, there’s a great zen-like moment where you’re just… rocking. The game might not look all that great from a distance (or even up close), and people might disregard it as cheap, but they’d be passing up something unique that practically anyone can play.

This game is much more difficult to play in later levels than it may initially appear from screenshots and trailers.\n\nThis game might bring much nostalgia to you if you were around Newgrounds during the days that Xiao Xiao was really popular, because this is very much a spiritual successor to it.\n\nIt has a nice learning curve and is easy to pick up but somewhat difficult to truly master. For completionists out there, you might like the fact that it has a medal system. While it may seem easy to get a platinum medal for the first few missions, the difficulty ramps up with each campaign mission. Here's where my one and only complaint with the game comes from. While it occasionally varies it's many missions up with laser sword, crash, and numchuck missions, after a short while of playing it can feel very samey. Which isn't a bad thing because the game is addictive as all hell, but you might want to play in short bursts for maximum enjoyment.\n\nFor $5? This game is definitely worth it, it's highly entertaining, replayable and very addictive. A survival mode in any game for me is a huge plus and this game has three different kinds of survival modes (Well, technically two, the third one is just regular survival with a giant cat obscuring one side of your screen), one of which tests your game knowledge by taking away all visual cues except for enemy color.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Therexa/recommended/264200/","Therexa","Therexa","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Therexa/","55 products in account","This game is phenomenal, cheap and a MUST BUY.\n\nThe game begins easy at the start and gradually works its way up to being actually quite challenging; especially on the later levels. The range of enemies that require different fighting 'patterns' and the wide variety and types of levels keeps things fresh and always keeps you on your toes so that you never really play the same level the same way.\nBecause each level in itself is reasonably short you can play them in short bursts during your lunch breaks without having to worry about getting half-way through and having to quit and lose huge amounts of progress. Alternatively you can try and master through all the levels in a weekend or day off; perfect for stress relief.\n\nThe 'mastery' and perfection system in this game is also another reason I'd highly recommend it. Each level you play through awards you medals from nothing to the all sacred 'perfect medal' for a flawless game. For someone like myself who loves a challenge, this mechanic is amazing because I could play the same level 10+ times aiming for the elusive flawless game, still miss it and not care because I was having too much fun to care.\n\nBut what really works well in this game is it's adaptive difficulty. But, what's that?\nWell, if you're kicking bad guys asses too often and blazing through the levels super quick or just generally finding the game too easy, the enemies will get faster and harder to predict until you ultimately get your asses kicked instead (which actually makes for a lot of chaotic fun).\nAnd yet, if you're having trouble passing a level because they run at you too fast or you just can't get the patterns right the game will slow 'em down a little for you and give you a little breathing room... but don't expect it to hold your hand.\n\n\ntl;dr\nWhat other game can make you feel like an awesome kung-fu master kicking bad guys asses using only two buttons?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dunetiger/recommended/264200/","dunetiger","Dune Tiger","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dunetiger/","2220 products in account","I cannot even begin to describe how awesomely fun this game is.  You'd expect a lot less from Silver Dollar Games, makers of endless shovelware for XBLA and PC, with gems like Outbreak on Uranus, Who's the Daddy 1 and 2, Don't Be Nervous Talking to Girls, and the perennial favorite, Try Not to Fart.\n\nWith a track record like that, you'd be absolutely forgiven for thinking that One Finger Death Punch (OFDP) would be yet another pebble in the doodoo pile, but in every honking pile of ♥♥♥♥ is a kernel of greatness - OFDP is the gleaming piece of corn that stands out and probably makes you laugh.\n\nLike most great games, the core mechanic is simple - LMB attacks left, RMB attacks right.  There is nothing else for you to do in the game.  On the surface, it seems shallow and stupid - like almost all of Silver Dollar's back catalog - but there is some serious twitch action to be found and surprising depth from a game that uses only two buttons.\n\nYour character, the kung fooeyist of kung fu masters, stands in the middle of the field as endless waves of baddies rush in to attack him (or her - it's a stick person).  Beneath each baddie is a clue on how to defeat them; most are single-punch dismissals, but as you progress through the hundred levels (spread in 3 difficulties), they become more clever, have weapons, dodge your initial attacks, require multiple hits, swing from side to side, engage you in furious clicky duels, and so on and so forth.  Soon enough, you start a "mob round" and see there's 200 guys you need to combo and you don't want to miss a single hit if you're going to get that platinum medal.  But even if you're not the perfectionist, there's plenty of challenges for you to overcome, skills to unlock, and fantastic slaughterfest weapon levels (light sword levels are awesome).\n\nIs it worth $5?  That's subjective.  I picked it up in a bundle and have been playing it non-stop.  I've paid more for less.  If it means Silver Dollar Games will continue to make actual good games, I say give 'em your fiver and wait for the inevitable follow up.\n\nIf anything, I would LOVE to see art assets applied to the characters.  I get the appeal of the stick fighter, but given that these are all sprites with not a single 'tween' animation, a little character art would elevate this game to new heights.  Besides that, though, OFDP offers a solid, engaging arcade experience that is unreasonably, inexplicably fun.  You will agree once you get your first massive no-miss combo and if achievements are your thing, this game has plenty and doles them out quite often.\n\nBUY IT.","May 25, 2014","true","19.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/theinsightman/recommended/264200/","theinsightman","orange.man.from","http://steamcommunity.com/id/theinsightman/","13 products in account","I just want to lay some ground rules here before we start... You have to be dedicated, there's no way you can expect to finish or halfway finish on the whim that you feel like it. This is a journey, you're in, or you quit. Second, this I will defend this game to my grave. And third, there is no third. Now, onto this horridly long review, this'll be fun.\n\nI do believe I understand a thing or two about this game, just check my achevements and I've compleated Grandmaster mode, which is no walk in the park. let me start you off with the basics, you press to the right, you kill the enemy to your right, you press to the left, you kill the enemy to the left. you fight an enemy with more than one hit, you hit him again either right or left. Very basic, and this basic combat system does not change throughout the entirety of the game. Reading this after the other reviews, you know this becomes less simple, and levels become increasingly difficult. I'll just tell you that this is how the game is played, it can't be done another way. Another basic is the map, you start from the left side, and you fight your way to the right, collecting power-ups and skills along with increased combat experience all the way. The last basic this you need to know is not distract youself. I know this sounds easy but losing your focus can cost you life, maybe even your own...\n\nNow that you know the basics, lets explore the game. The game's level types are:\nMob rounds (The most common and the core of the game)\nSpeed rounds (Basically Mob rounds but to see how fast you can do them)\nBoss Rounds (You find these all over the place and they're difficult)\nLight Sword and Nunchuku Rounds (The player's worst nightmare on the higher speeds, the Nunchuku rounds are easier)\nRetro Film Rounds (There to make the brawler fights harder)\nThuderstorm Rounds (Something I can't wrap my head around as hard because of the change in colors, or a gift because the brawlers or non-existant, anyways, these are hard too)\nDagger, Bomb, Defender rounds (I f****** hate these rounds. thery're fast and if you mess up ONE TIME YOU DIE!!!)\nSmash rounds (Basically survive until the game is over, the fake objective is to smash enemies into objects)\nSurvival rounds (You can skip these)\nAnd Finally, the Multi-Rounds, i think these are easy because there are little enimies and you memorize them after doing it over and over again)\nNow, you can't have levels without any enimies now can you...\nThere are several combinations of enemies, most enemies can be killed with a sigle hit, others are a bit more unique. Oh, and all enimies are capable of holding wepons (We'll cover that later)\nGray (one shot, one kill enemies)\nColored enemies... (There's a space under them to show you how to react to them).. too vague? well how about you memorize all the colors of enemies??? Oh O.K. I'll try to remember...\nGreen (Hit two times in their direction to kill them))\nBlue (Hit towards them once, hit the other way once)\nThis is where there become too many colors, just know they have up to four hits.\nBrawlers (You learn to dislike these guys because you don't know how many hits they have. When you hit these enemies you have to kill them before you can fight another enemy)\nWarning, this next message could be classified as spoiler, scroll over at your own risk. "?"  (You can never tell how many hits these guys have. Exclusive to the end of Master and During Grandmaster mode)\nThrower (Gray enemies whose soul purpose is to toss a wepon that upon capture can be thrown at other enemies. It is pointless to attempt killing these enemies because not only do they move along with the edge of the screen, but because their wepon counts as their kill)\nBoss enemies (no different from normal color enemies except they are exclusive to Boss rounds and after completion of ther hits continually spawn new ones until the health bar at the top of the screen is depleated)\nThese are the wepons in this game, wepons are either picked up from killed enemies, throwers, on special rounds such as Dagger, Bomb, Defender, or after being depleted to one health you are given the golden sword for the remainder of the level, whether it be dying or becoming victorious. All wepons except thrown wepons increase your hit zone for a duration of time.\nStaffs (Then most common of the wepons, the thrown ability kills three enemies on distributed equally among the two different sides.)\nClubs (Have a cool effect when swung, thrown ability is confusing to predict as it will ocasionally bounce over enemies and kill or miss them, very annoying)\nSwords (By far the coolest looking and sounding wepon in the game, their thrown ability clears an entire side of the screen of anything, thrown wepons to brawlers, the sword does it all, just be sure to mind the other side of the screen too)\nThe Spiked Ball Of Death (The Ball is going to become the wepon you will use until you can no longer humainly contain it within the boundries of the screen. You hit the ball, it hits an enemy, the enemy dies. Amazing wepon and I always use it until I miss a hit... and it bounces off the screen. Such a sad death)\nDaggers, Bombs, and Arrows (You pick these wepons up either by killing an enemy holding a Bow and/or Dagger, Bomb or in Dagger/Bomb rounds. When these wepons make contact with an enemy they die. Only downside is that you do not move while using these three wepons, meaning you have to use them fast and then keep going or else enemies may catch up to you)\nOther Dead Bodies (While it is extremely rare, you may occasionally pick up a fallen enemy and use him to bash out the brains of his own kind)\nWell, that covers the combat and the map, keep reading if you aren't sold, but down here contains fatal game flaws as well as more positive stuff. Continue at your own risk, and while you're at it, buy this $5 game, it's worth it.\n\n\n\n\n\nO.K. You stuck around. Now we use personal experience, and a bit of reading on the internet, to see what real-life premises are lurking about in the hard-to-reach hidden gameplay mechanics you probably haven't gotten word about... Secretive enough for you?\nSo let's give the bad news first. There are, enevitably, fatal flaws in this one-of-a-kind brawler. I'll give you the biggies, and the smallies (Thumbs up if you think that's a word).\nCommon complaints:\n"Time-Warping"-- A game mechanic designed to give you a tiny break in the action and show off your stick-man's epic skills. however, this simple and honest slow motion has the potential to catch you off guard at higher speeds. And getting yourself thrown off\nSuch flaws or misconceptions lead to the few negative reviews for this title. And it's sad to say, but the bad reviews usually come from the ones with the greatest play times.\n\nTo be continued... What? It's two in the morning, this review os taking forever to write so I'm going to bed. O.K. I promise I'll finish writing, just, eh... I'll finish it, this game means enough to me to finish it.

You control a stick figure martial arts master, fighting an onslaught of enemies that appear from the sides of the screen. You only use two buttons, left and right mouse buttons, to attack enemies on the left and right of your character. It sounds simply, but One Finger Death Punch masterfully layers increasingly complex situations until eventually you either die like a punk or stand tall as a totally badass kung fu master.\n\nWith great visual feedback for each hit, a variety of weapons that you can turn against their wielders, and just straight-up solid-feeling gameplay, this is one of those little games you just can’t put down. When in the middle of a fight, chaining together combos and not even seeing the colour-coded hints on which buttons to press, there’s a great zen-like moment where you’re just… rocking. The game might not look all that great from a distance (or even up close), and people might disregard it as cheap, but they’d be passing up something unique that practically anyone can play. Although the cartoon violence might not be suitable for really young kids.","September 22, 2014","true","2.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It has HOURS AND HOURS of gameplay with almost endless replayability!\n\nI bought this game thinking I would probably play it for a week or two but I am completely hooked. When I'm bored of other games or I dont have the time to play games like ARK: Survival Evolved or H1Z1 I hop onto OFDP thinking I am only gonna play a few levels then I'm done, but a few minutes later, soon turns into A FEW HOURS...\n\nIf you want something fresh in your Steam Library to play then why not get One Finger Death Punch! It's EXTREMELY fun and addicting and only cost 5$!!!\n\n- This was my first review! If you guys think I did well it would be great if you left a rating or comment me if I should do anything different next time!

I've barely cleared half of the first difficulty though I've played for 10 hours. It is not a button masher, timing is everything. Fast reflexes and excellent visual perception won't do you any harm either.\n\nKudos to the developers, Silver Dollar: you've really outdone yourself on developing your dream game.

This is a game that fits the description of "greater than the sum of all its parts." With no story, stick figure visuals and two button controls, how could this be great? My answer: perfection in tailored difficulty and breakneck speed action. This game consistently throws at you the most exhilarating level of challenge without crossing over into frustration. Are you tired and sluggish today? No problem, the kung-fu will slow down to match you. Just loaded up on coffee? Don't get cocky because as fast as you go, this game will keep up.\n\nIt is precisely because of the two button control scheme that One Finger Death Punch is able to be such a fast paced game. I applaud the developers for finding this strength in what otherwise seems like a weak choice for controls. Similar praise could be given to the visuals. They're far from AAA quality but they're vibrant, fluid and joyously violent enough to work. The sound is deliciously impactful as you smash enemies through walls or cut them down with a light sword. I would have welcomed more tracks on the soundtrack but what is there fits the quick tempo of the combat. The announcer, while campy, is as fun to listen to as his accent is over-the-top. I'd also like to highlight the hilarious "No Luca No" survival mode that adds a nice human (and feline) touch to the game.\n\nAll this adds up to a game that is entertaining through and through.","November 7, 2014","true","24.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

In this way, it has a good deal of replayability as you will want to make perfect your score on every level.

Don't be put off by Newgrounds-esque game art, this is an well thought out game that is a shining example of what can be done when when developers know what they're doing and stick to what they know best.\n\nRecently, many indie studios have, instead of starting with a simple proof-of-concept, jump headlong into what they intend to be a ground-breaking masterpiece.  The vast majority of the time, as to be expected, they miss, shooting themselves in the foot while shooting for the stars.  Silver Dollar Games knew what they were doing here.  They knew their budget was limited, they knew they weren't Rembrandt, so instead of trying their hands at something they knew they couldn't do, they instead focused on solid gameplay.\n\nThat's basically what this game boils down to, a fantastic twitch-based brawler hidden behind a mediocre art-style.  If you know what's good for you, give this game a try; it's WELL worth your time and $5.","January 10, 2015","true","23.2"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","1"

There is no story to speak of but I don’t think it needs one, all it does is put an army in front of you in the middle of a thunderstorm and says “bet you can’t beat all of em without missing once or taking a single hit”.  One of the most satisfying for me is when the game goes into slow mo to show the opponents heart shoot out the back of his chest or give an X-ray shot of his ribcage crumpling by your fist.  This game disserves to be popular just for the spectacle of it.\nBottom line, if you’re looking for a simple game that will challenge your button mashing tendencies and has a bunch of “oh ♥♥♥♥!” moments, than this is the game for you.","March 21, 2014","true","17.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Many of them just dont grab my attention.  So I saw a video of this on youtube and it seemed interesting so I gave it a try.  Heck it was only $2.50.  I must say.  It was a $2.50 well spent.  This game is very entertaining.  Who could of thought that only using the two main buttons on the mouse could offer such enjoyment.  I get more satisifaction landing combos playing this then most triple A, high budget fighting titles.  Dont be fooled.  This is not a button mashing game.  Each mouse click needs to be timed correctly in order to succesfully land a attack.  Its easy enough for my non-gamer wife to enjoy and challenging enough for someone like me to keep me interested.

It has this satisfying feeling due to the fact that the controls are immediate. That every button press is hugely significant and that it does exactly what you expect it to; punch a dude's head off.\n\nIt's a game you gain a bunch of satisfaction from getting really good at, much like another game I love, Spelunky. They're totally different, they're both just challenging as hell. But I think the kidn of eprson who takes joy in becoming awesome at a game like that will love this game.\n\nIt's also a game you can just spend a couple hours on and be happy. It's concentrated fun and even if you don't fall in love with it you will not regret the purchase, especially on sale or in a bundle.\n\nThe only segment of gamers this game isn't for are those who literally only care about story. It has none. Literally, none. It doesn't even pretend. But that's not a con.\n\nIt's levels of various kinds of "punch all these dudes' heads off" then the occasional boss level, in which you fight one (well, I say one...) awesome dude. And to me that made a really epic (in the proper sense) narrative in and of itself. It let me create my own daydreams. Give my stickman (who I named Chow Yun Stick) backstory. I imagine that boss's name is Tao Lin and he killed my brother Fa Long and we were jsut simple farmers but then I swore vengeance and trained ofr years and meanwhile he became the head of the Triad and now I must punch through his minions to avenge my brother and OHMYGODAWESOME.\n\nAlso, once you beat a mode, one of the devs appears and talks to you, and thanks you profusely for playing his game. He even does it in text between levels. Those guys will be REALLY thankful to you if you buy this game. It's really adorable. It made me want to buy it again 'cause it just seemed like they really needed it. Like they're literally a studio with one silver dollar to their names.","November 30, 2014","true","38.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The team at Silver Dollar has done what many companies strive for but few have succeeded in.  They have made a game of simplicity and pure fun.  From the beginning to the end this game delivers.\n\nFrom the moment you start up the game one thing is very clear.  This game has a personality, and that personality is awesome.  With an epic soundtrack that would make any Shaw Bros. kung fu movie of old jealous you are emersed in a journey through intense kung fu battles all via your simple stick figure avatar.\n\nThe controls are just as simple as the graphics, and there is a beauty in that regards that many big budget games seem to overlook.  You don't need fancy GPU instensive graphics to have fun.  You just need fun to have fun.  From silly death animations to a variety of incredible levels involving light swords, nunchucks, thrunderstorms, and retro film themes you are a  kung fu master, and often I found myself just laughing and smiling through countless sessions and levels.\n\nIn addition to this fast paced action world of wonder the devs have even taken it one step further by adding numerous levels and game modes for you to enjoy in increasing difficulty.  Not only is the game immensely fun, but it's also challenging and hard as you progress.  The depth and skill curve is accurately balanced as the game adjusts to your speed of difficulty finding that perfect calibration to your skill level.\n\nThere is no doubt that this is a special title.  It's not often that you get to experience a game like this, but even in your last moments of hardship in the game the devs are right there sending you a sword from the heavens as if to say "We know you might not make it, but take this.. we believe in you".   I haven't had this kind of experience playing a game in a long long time.  It's nothing but pure joy, and a title I would recommend to anyone looking for a game that is fun, challenging, funny, epic, and that has a lot of heart.

It’s a 2D brawler that uses only two mouse buttons (or keys depending on your preference), and all its characters are simple stick figures. Enemies come at you from both sides of the screen, while you remain in the middle. You can’t move, you instead must wait for enemies to come close enough to be in range, once they are you either tap left or right according to which side they are on to attack.\n\nBefore we delve further into the gameplay, let’s quickly go over the controls. The game instructs you to use only the left and right mouse buttons, and as the name implies, you’re supposed to do so using only one finger. However, I found I preferred using two fingers, one on each button more. More than that, I didn’t actually use the mouse to play more than a few levels to test it. While the game makes no mention of it, you can also use the left and right arrow keys, or the A and D keys (of WASD fame) to play. The game however does not allow you to remap the controls at all. Thankfully though, using two fingers and the arrow keys worked wonderfully for me and I’d have not remapped even if I could.\n\nThe gameplay features two modes, level and survival. Level mode will introduce you to the basics of the game, so let’s talk about that first.\n\nI already talked about waiting for enemies to move into range, and how to attack, so we’ll not go over that again. As for attacking, you want to avoid button mashing, as it’ll cause you to miss. Missing makes you more likely to be hit by an enemy, as your character has a brief pause after missing before being able to attack again. Since you only have a limited amount of health for each level (usually 10 HP, but it varies by the level, sometimes only a single HP). If you manage to complete a level without being hit, you will receive a perfect. You will also receive a medal depending on how many times you missed. 0 earns you a platinum, 1-3 a gold, 4-6 a silver, 7-9 a bronze, and 10+ won’t net you a medal at all.  Achieving perfects and medals will not earn you anything in the game, but chances are you’ll keep replaying many levels until you get a perfect and a platinum medal.\n\nWhen you first start the game, enemies will consist of simple one hit enemies and brawlers. Brawlers are a special type of enemy that brings you into a fight against just that one enemy, consisting of various left and right strikes (the rest of the level momentarily is tuned out until after you defeat the brawler). As the game progress brawlers will have longer sequences of left and right, and more enemy types will appear. Now, there isn’t great variety in the enemy types, mostly it consists of the enemies requiring more hits to be defeated, and the order for the button presses needed to defeat them (some enemies dodge to the other side of your character after being hit). All the enemies are colour coded, so you can simply glance at them to determine the number of hits and order of the attack. Not keen on memorizing that? No need to worry, there will be coloured bars beneath each enemy indicating the order of the hits. Blue bars mean you click to the left, and red bars mean a click to the right, with the order of the bars going from top to bottom.\n\nWhat’s surprising is just how satisfying it is too mow down your enemies. But punching through hordes of coloured stick people does feel satisfying, with each hit you land providing a satisfying crunch. And the occasional gory death shot that randomly occurs is a nice touch as well.\n\nAs you plow through your stick figured foes, sometimes they’ll drop weapons that you can use to aid you in your fight. Melee weapons like swords and maces extend your range of attack, but can only be used for a limited amount of time. Ranged weapons like arrows, daggers, and bombs can be thrown across the screen to kill any enemy in a single hit, regardless of their health. You’ll only get one of a ranged weapon at a time though (unless you use are using a skill that causes you to pick up 3 at a time, but we’ll talk more about skills in a bit).\n\nAs you progress through the game you’ll encounter different types of stages. The bulk of your gameplay will be done in melee stages, which are just a simple assault of different enemies. You’ll also have special weapons rounds, in which you wield either a light sword or nunchucks, as you’re assaulted by a quick barrage of single hit enemies. Speed rounds impose a time limit upon you, requiring you to be swift in your punching. Multi rounds will have you play the same short wave of enemies multiple times in a row, with an increase in speed each time. Survival rounds test to see how many enemies you can defeat before you are killed (and always reward you with a victory, regardless of how well you do). There are other types of levels as well.\n\nLevels are selected from a map screen, which is frankly horrid. It’s not that I have issue with the map screen, but it’s just simply god-awful. It’s ugly to look at, does not allow you to scroll, instead forcing you to navigate by clicking on levels, which is overly cumbersome when trying to go to a level that’s 2 screens away. The map features branching paths for the levels, but there’s little rhyme or reason to the different paths, just levels thrown on each that are gradually increasing in difficulty, rendering the map largely pointless –save from an excursion down a side path that leads to a dead end containing  a skill.\n\nSpeaking of skills, let’s talk about those now. As you play through the game you’ll be able to procure various skills from certain levels as a reward for their completion. Skills may be equipped at the level select screen, and you may use up to 3 at a time. Skills range from allowing you to pick up 3 ranged weapons instead of 1, to healing a single hit point, temporarily extending your attack range, freezing enemies, and more.\n\nThe time to complete level mode will vary by how much time you spend redoing a levels to get a perfect. If you simply try to beat all the levels, it should only take you about 6 hours.\n\nThat pretty much covers level mode, so let’s talk about survival mode. First of all, it’s important to note that survival mode is much different than the survival rounds you’ll encounter in level mode. For that matter it’s also much better than level mode’s survival rounds. Before you begin an attempt at survival mode, you may select the skills you wish to use, and then you are thrown into combat. As you go along, enemy speed and difficulty will gradually increase. Every so often you’ll be thrown into a weapon round (triggered by not missing and not being hit), alternating between light sword and nunchucks. They are not only a great way to quickly rack up extra kills, they also allow you to regain HP by killing a special enemy that charges at you every so often. Weapon rounds end after you are hit 4 times, and the hits you take during a weapon round do not detract from your HP.\n\nNow let’s talk criticisms before we go. I mentioned two already, the horrid map design, and lack of an option to remap keys. Aside from that, the game’s menus and interface are clunky and more difficult to use than they should be. When you first launch the game it gives you the option to make the window size bigger or smaller, or to make it full screen, but you’re not able to adjust this once you make your choice without closing and relaunching the game. Thankfully, none of these criticisms detract much from the game.\n\nWhen all is said and done though, OFDP is well worth a go, as stick figure combat is apparently highly entertaining. Plus it’s only a couple bucks, so why not give it a shot?","March 4, 2015","true","17.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you're a fan of martial arts movies and good fight choreography and want something cheap and simple to pass the time, this game will do the trick wonderfully. Some of the moves and maneuvers you'll be pulling off just with two mouse buttons will give you plenty of 'oooooh' moments as well just laughing with glee as you take on hundreds of enemies like an unstoppable Jet Li. Doesn't hurt that they throw in a few twists to make things interesting including giving your a lightsaber or nunchuks and task you with deffeating over a hundred enemies before coming to a boss that has you feverishly matching the correct button presses to attack, counterattack, and dodge to defeat them.\n\nIf there's any downside it's that it gets pretty reflex intensive at times and requires you to get in a good rhythm for later stages and further in on survival mode. Otherwise, for $5, it's a great deal. If anything, the later challenge and zen-like requirement to pull the later action off might be a turn on for some people like myself.

It's just one of those games that did it perfectly, and whether they did it accidentally or purposfully doesn't matter. This game perfectly combines an originally creative and simplistic "Stick-guy" graphics style, amazingly effective gameplay, and terrificly implemented elements that appeals to all kinds gamers. Whether you only have time to game for 5 minutes a day or you have the time to sit and see how good of a score you can get on each course, you're able to get TONS of fun out of this game, that will keep you coming back for more. Not only that, but it does it so freaking simply. You have 2 buttons! That's it! This entire game is played with 2 buttons, and the game keeps creating new ways of implementing the same two buttons in ways that you never get bored of it. How genious is that?! I have no idea how it does it, but you barely even think about what you're clicking when you really get into it, you just become one with the game, and thus become a badass. It makes you feel like a master at the game from level one, while still managing to be VERY challenging, especially down the line, yet the game continuosly makes you feel like no one can stop you. This game is one "F*ck Yeah!" moment after another, and as far as I can tell, it never stops delivering. This game is easily one of my top 5 favorite games of all time, and probably my favorite Indie Game, and I hope everyone who wants to experience the true rush of a kung-fu master (aka: EVERYBODY) takes a look at this game. Plus, it's 5 dollars, just do yourself a favor and buy it already. Silver Dollar did it SO right.","March 8, 2014","true","24.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DissyQ/recommended/264200/","DissyQ","Chaos, in a Box!®","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DissyQ/","166 products in account","Do you like kung fu movies? Do you like indie games? Do you like 2D never-done-before type stuff? If you answered yes to any of these, I'd suggest picking up the game.\nThis quite the indie game treasure. Though it may look so simple by it's art style, the game play surely backs it up. It's a basis of you pressing two buttons as enemies aproach you while you kick their metaphorical and literal behinds. You may be thinking, "Why can't I just walk to them and do that?" Then it'd just be silly. Clearly.\n\nIn this game, don't really suspect a story as I felt none was implimented. You're main character is a simple stick man that doesn't look much different from other stick men then he a distinct color. Your foes of kung fu powah are simply: 1 hit gray man, Look mah I am green and can block a hit, I am a slightly different color of other guys and will confuse you while you are in you are being mobbed, Look dad I am blue and can change sides, ect ect. Others are a different color and attack pattern. I suppose we are lacking in the character department, but that is easy to look over when you play through.\n\nAh yes, the gameplay. It's quite simple but very satifying. As I said earlier, you basically are concrete on the floor till one of your foes comes close enough and allows you to move at the stake of his life. This may seem a turn down as with most fighting games (at least I've experience) allow a free movement to get the baddies. Now you take it home personal. I enjoyed the concept and it helped the game follow in a way that increased that bad♥♥♥ feeling inside me. I though had some trouble when coming off of combos where I had clicked to much and led me getting a missed hit. I kinda wished they added some safe guard off of that where the fighting would resume without you being unprepared for it. Other then that small complaint, I think everything ran smooth and flowed.\n\nAs for gamemodes, you are presented with levels mode and survival mode. Levels mode consists of a good sized map where you proceed from challange to challange to get around. Through the map system, you are able to fight to special missions that unlock you perks which you can use in most battles for your advantage. One example as one of the first you receive is an arrow increase perk. It changes it from one arrow you can shoot to two extra when you kill an enemy. It was a good system, but of course some perks didn't fair well with some others. Still onto the map, there's a varied skill of challanges. Some could be a wee bit difficult, but so far I've found they either easy to medium range of skill. Of course challange is upped in the following two skill levels, but that is pretty self explanatory. The second mode avaible is survival. It's self explanatory also. Beat up baddies till you are killed. In this mode, you are allowed to progress to the next harder survival mode by getting 500 kills. The last and third survival mode is quiet funny and worth getting to. Lets just say Silver Dollar Games gave a nod to one of their previous works. It's not really a nod... More like a photo. This unlock will make you wish it stayed at breakfast.\n\nSo in final, Silver Dollar Games and their rep for mixed quality of games, this is clearly one of their diamonds in the rough. I suggest it's worth the 5$ to spend on this game. To sum it up to if you still bothered to read: JACKEY CHAN SIMULATOR- 10/10. It'd be funny if they made some update to where the stick men are like horrible cutouts pasted onto the characters.

This is essentially action games boiled down into a simple two button beat'em up; an on-rails brawler as the game says.  It borrows the old XiaoXiao stickman kung fu aesthetic from years past and turns the gameplay into a simple button slamming (but not mashing) experience.\n\nYou're in the middle of the screen - enemies at you from the left and right.  When they get within "range", your left mouse button/X button hits enemies on your left, and your right mouse button hits enemies on your right.  You'll kill them in one hit, but you'll do crazy looking moves to do so - stuff you'd see out of old 80s/90s kung fu films.\n\nSimple concept, right?  Most enemies go down in one hit and every hit you're rewarded with an awesome looking animation.\n\nBut it doesn't stop there.  The game takes this concept and runs as far and as fast as it can with it.  Later enemies will require multiple hits to kill.  Others require you to engage in a one on one fight in the middle of the level, and some enemies require you to hit them in a 2-4 button sequence of left and right presses.  Suddenly, that simple "hit the button to kill an enemy" thing starts to get some bit of depth.\n\nThey add to this by letting you use weapons on your enemies: from bombs to bows, swords, spiked clubs, spears, etc.  These weapons increase your range, allowing you to hit the button earlier when an enemy is charging at you, and you can even throw them at enemies if the conditions are right.  Some of them kill in one hit, allowing you to take down those pesky multihit enemies that I described above.\n\nBut that's not all, you can even unlock skills that allow you to initiate special attacks: do a screen clearing earthquake move, slow down time, freeze enemies in their tracks, and so on.\n\nCombine this simple yet incredibly deep gameplay with dozens of levels to play through, three difficulty modes, three survival modes, tons of unlocks, and a parody of the traditional Chinese kung fu flick, and you get an awesome, addicting, and pulse pounding game.\n\nSeriously, for $5, you can't go wrong.  And if you're reading this review during a Steam sale?  This game is a no brainer.  GET THIS.  You won't be sorry.","August 17, 2014","true","34.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Not a button masher at all. Your moves need to be calculated and precicely timed. One Finger Death Punch punishes you for mistakes and makes combos rewarding. You can pick-up many weapons, both ranged and melee, which extend your reach when attacking oncoming enemies. With over 250 levels and multiple difficulties, as well as a three survival modes, there is plenty of challenge and replayability.","June 1, 2014","true","6.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The entire concept of the game is fighting by pressing two buttons.

And if it seems too easy for you, the game will simply adjust to a higher speed. And if it's still not fast enough, there are 2 more difficulties.\n\nVisually, it's just pleasing to look at. Both from a player point of view, and as a spectator. With little "fatalities" and interaction between player, enemies and environment, the team at Silver Dollar have really squeezed a lot of juice out of a rather small lemon, and made one fantastic drink that I personally intend to enjoy in the shade all summer.\n\nMy one criticism would be, that I'm too slow for grand master mode.","March 23, 2014","true","39.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Initially the player starts out in "Levels mode" which reveals an extensive map featuring a plethora of branching paths comprised of varing types of stages, from the basic "mob" level that requires you to simply massacre a set number of opponents, to more inventive levels such as the "Lightning" level which adds darkness with intermittant lightning strikes to the mix.\n\nEnemies come in many flavours, from the basic "Greys" that require a single hit to destroy, to a wide array of colours each requiring a different combination of left and right mouse button clicks to sucessfully beat down, and finally the crown wearing 'bosses' that, once engaged, pits you one on one in a time sensitive duel that requires the player to hit the right combination of left and rights when the correct indicator appears within an area of the screen designated the "Combat Zone".\n\nProgress through enough of the initial levels and you unlock the true gems of One Finger Death Punch. Survival mode is, as you might expect, a test of the players staying power, endless numbers of enemies begin to spawn and it's up to you to stay alive as long as you can, using all of your martial arts skills, along with a vast array of weapons conveniently discarded by the piled up corpses of your foes.\n\nBut that's not all!\n\n"Levels" mode also presents the opportunity to unlock a wide array of skills, three of which can be active at any one time, these range from additional ammo for ranged weapons (once grabbed from a dead enemy), to bonuses to your standard attack range and even healing abilities that automatically activate after a set number of foes have been slain.\n\nThe skills you earn in "Levels" mode are directly transferrable to survival mode allowing a player to artifically postpone their inevitable death by swinging the balance of power slightly more in their favour.\n\nFinally lightsabe... I mean "Light Swords" and Nunchaku. these particular level types appear both as singular set piece missions in the "Levels" mode and also as an additional saving grace in survival mode. In these modes the game shifts slightly in style, the game world changes and the player and all his enemies become cast in shadow, the only object not hidden in darkness is the 'Light Sword', which lets face it is basically a green lightsaber, at this point all enemies are one hit kill as the player effortlessly slices his prey into giblets. The Nunchaku is similar in it's styling however where the Light sword level appears to be quite hellish, the sky being predominantely reds and oranges, the Nunchaku round feels all "Cyber" casting the sky in digital blues and evoking feelings of Tron.\n\nThe Light Sword and Nunchaku play a more important role in Survival, here they are represented on the screen by a slowly building bar which increases with every enemy you slay, once the bar is fully built up by your kill count you enter the Light Sword or Nunchaku round, now you have four energy orbs which replace your lives for the duration of the mode, now you find that after roughly every 50ish black stickman minions you murder a single white minion will appear, kill this guy and you gain a life back which adds to the amount you had remaining in the regular survival mode. Hits in Light sword and Nunchaku drain the four energy orbs you had meaning for as long as you can keep the Light Sword/ Nunchaku mode running you have the chance to fully replenish your lives to full so that once your last energy orb is gone and you return to the normal survival mode combat you have even more chance of getting a truly astronomical kill count.\n\nWith the game costing as little as it does there really is no reason why you shouldn't take the risk. Just look through all the positive reviews this game has managed to amass, this many players can't all be wrong surely?","March 29, 2014","true","79.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Even though playing with only the left and right mouse buttons, you quickly feel as if you're part of a kungfu movie yourself, putting Bruce Lee to shame with crazy martial arts. The better you play, the faster the enemies will move, and at certain points your reflexes are tested to their limits, as is your mouse hand.\nA perfect game for a rainy afternoon or just whenever. Still in doubt? Just get it!","April 24, 2014","true","7.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It teaches the basics well; it really is simply left and right clicking. I literally couldn't stop playing it the first time I launched it, managed to get 40+ achievements in a short period of time. It's so satisfying to see how perfect you can beat each level and each stick figure. There's fatalities, map destruction, explosions, decapitations, ribs breaking, hearts being punched out, throat punching, impaling, etc. You unlock different skills along the way such as receiving more ranged ammo, longer use of a weapon class(for ex. a staff or sword.) This bloody inhumane gameplay is filled with replayability and overall simplicity. I will forever enjoy killing everything in sight.
