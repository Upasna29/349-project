This game is incredible. This is Parappa the Rapper on Steroids. This game is the absolute GREATEST GAME EVER CONCIEVED.\n\nI had no idea what to expect from this game. I knew it was a rhythm game, but that's all I knew. Let me break down my experience so far with the game for anyone curious.\n\nI started off on a space station, reporting for space news on space channel 5. Some space rogues had taken the station over and were forcing all the space citizens to space dance. It was my space job to space rescue them all. I blasted all the space minions with the power of my funky-fresh, 80's blacksploitation soundtrack moves and finished the first level off by out-singing three super-powered space karaoke robots.\n\nBy this point I can barely contain myself, I am almost at the point of involuntarily emptying my bowels from the sheer force of my own maniacal laughter. If you're not on board yet then you have terrible taste and should reconsider your life choices.\n\nThe next level opened with the space mayor, who bares a striking resemblance to Doctor Robotnik, being space-kidnapped by the rhythm rogues. It was once again up to me and my funky newsteam to go and rescue him. The ground troop leader took him to Space Seaworld, where mutated space plants had captured a musical class of primary school kids. I rescued the children flawlessly, before moving on to the space-boss. Oh no! My reporter protagonist, aptly named "Ulala" has been tied up in the tentacles of the slimy space pirhana plant. I struggle to battle the plant as my avatar makes hilariously tasteless jokes about being sexually aroused, but emerge victorious! Once again destroying my enemies with the power of space dance just after beating a rival network's reporter in a space electric guitar battle. We rescue the space president who proceeds to warm our hearts with a beautiful solo that would touch the hearts of even the most jaded of gamers, before being kidnapped once again. Dude really needs better bodyguards.\n\nOur news team doesnt have to research for long before we have a hot new lead, but oh no! The space police and their highest ranking officer, Cyote Ugly in Space, is trying to stop us! Her giant, breast-shaped space cruiser is launching mammary missiles at us! Ulala and her trusty sidekick manage to beat her in a space drum battle, but no! it was a trap all along, orchestrated by the head of the space baddies! We've got to get back to Space Station 5 and rescue Space channel 5's commanding officer, Space Michael Jackson. No, I'm not even kidding. You have to rescue Space Michael F*cking Jackson with the power of dance.\n\nI have to stop for now, my chest hurts too much to go on.\n\n11/10.","August 27, 2014","true","3.2"," 36 of 45 people (80%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","80","36","45","8","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/macmillan333/recommended/71260/","macmillan333","MacMillan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/macmillan333/","83 products in account","Fantastic. A must-have classic for music gamers.\n\nWhat impressed me most is their idea that, a whole plot can be added to a very simple kind of gameplay. You "chu" and "hey" all the way with Ulala, saving the Space President and breaking the evil plan. You meet accidents. You fight, and then ally with the police. You rush for a save, only to run into an ambush. You die and get revived. You defeat an enemy who used to be your friend. And of course there's the final showdown.\n\nAnd the music is just awesome. In every part the music gives a different feeling that perfectly fits the corresponding scenario, yet the same theme keeps appearing once in a while. The voice actors also do well. Not fully satisfying, but well (personal opinion: the Japanese voiceover sounds better than the English one). As for graphics, well, just don't expect too much from a 2002 game. A recent update added support for big resolutions and FXAA, so things should look at least okay. The dancing is pretty sexy though.\n\nYou play the game simply by repeating whatever command is chanted to you, such as "up, down, up, down, chu, chu, chu". It sounds easy, and yes, it is easy. What's hard is the hidden command. You have to press keys at specific moments during cutscenes. This is not QTE: there aren't any obvious hints for these, so you have to research and remember when to do this. Only by hitting all the hidden commands can you get a full score. I suppose the purpose of adding this is to add difficulty and replayability, but sometimes these commands get way too hard to hit. And since the stages are really long, it takes too much time to try again after a failed attempt.\n\nConclusion: overall, this game is fabulous. Classical. So classical that Michael Jackson himself came to play a role. There are certain aspects that people may not like, but they don't ruin the game as a whole. Recommended to any music game player, and other players looking for a never-before-seen genre of gaming.\n\nP.S. Sega really gave us a big surprise by making an update TWELVE years after the original game shipped. This update fixed almost all existing problems with the previous version, such as you had to tweak system registry to make the configuration tool work, as well as added support for achievements, high resolutions, V-sync and FXAA. However I still encountered two problems after this update:\n\n1. Occasionally the game goes out of sync with the music. I met this problem without V-sync, so I turned it on, and now all characters have disappeared. WTF?\n2. Though the new configuration tool makes English voiceover the default option, my game still uses the Japanese one. Fixed by changing the option to Japanese, and then back to English again. Just a one-time problem.\n\n+ creative rhythmic action\n+ sexy dancing\n+ awesome soundtrack\n+ story\n+ collectibles: the game tells you its own cheat code!\n+ 2 player co-op and 100-stage marathon (200-stage, actually)\n+ Space Michael\n+ surprise update fixing most problems\n- unbalanced difficulty: main game too easy, while hidden commands too hard\n10 out of 10, masterpiece.","January 28, 2014","true","18.5"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

I've played it for more than two dozen hours on PS2, and I bought it anyway on Steam just because.  The animation and choreography are a joy to watch, the music is catchy and varied, the controls are tight, and the port is perfect.  Gameplay is basically Simon Says to music, so it's pretty much accessible to anyone, and the crazy settings and situations keep things fresh, funny, and entertaining from start to finish.  It also comes loaded with extras (costumes, microphones, survival, and 2-player), so there are a ton of ways to really get the most out of your Channel 5 experience. I just wish it included the first one.","September 23, 2011","true","6.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Space bad guys bust a move in perfect synch to the (awsome, nigh-infinitely varied) background music, and you need to use the arrow keys or the D-Pad to bust those move right back at 'em! If you have no sense of rhythm, if you can't feel the beat of the music, if you can't use it to instantly determine when is the right moment to press buttons, you will fail, and fail hard. Simple as that.\n\nThe game, as far as video games have come as of yet, is the medium's ultimate example of merging a game's music in perfect synchronicity with the player's actions. Playing the game is essentially palying an interactive dance flick with occasional musical numbers. A Broadway production in which YOU are the star.\n\nDid I mention that this game looks like whath the future would look like if the sixties never ended? Did I mention that this game ACTUALLY TELLS A STORY? WIth CONFLICT and stuff?\n\nOh, and did I mention that this game has MICHAEL JACKSON?\n\nThere is so much, oh so so so much more to be said about this game, but alas the Steam review section could simply never accomodate for it. Suffice it to say, to this day, there has yet to be a a rhythm game developed that is superior to Space Channel 5: Part 2.\n\n(Some audio had to be cut from the first level of the english language PC and Xbox 360 releases of the game, as the game was originally localized exclusively for the Playstation 2, so the phrases "use the X button to shoot the robots, "when you hear "hey", press the Circle button" and "press the X button when you hear "chu"" would make no sense to players using a keyboard or an Xbox 360 controller, but the fact that Sega provides players with the original japanese voice track upon purchase of the PC version more than makes up for the lack of any newly-recorded audio.)\n\n(Also, the Steam release of the PC version (there is also a boxed retail version of the game available in the "Dreamcast Collection") may have problems writing registry values in Windows so it's possible that the game won't recognize the settings you configure, such as resolution, language etc.. Check the game's community hub for the existing solution to this problem should it occour.)","June 26, 2012","true","6.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I know, someone is already going to say I suck and if I suck I shouldn't review the game. But I honestly don't think I do. I try to do the rhythms like in the game, UP UP UP, then I do that and it doesn't work, like it's not in sync.\n\nI tried with the keyboard and controller and both work pitfully. I have no idea what I am doing wrong?? Until I figure out why I can't even do the first segment without failing, I have no choice but to not recommend, for fear of it just being a bad PC port as people on 360 who have this seem to be able to play it fine.\n\nThe other games however in the Dreamcast Collection I have had 0 problems with.

While this is a very faithful port of the original Dreamcast game, this particular game has lots to be desired as far as accuracy goes. I have more then the desired amount of memory that the game requires and a 2.4 ghz Intel Core 2 Duo processor and this game has issues with musical sync tied in with the right button presses. In the second news report, the sync seems to get really bad if you goof up pressing the right buttons even once. I promise, I've not had a few beers where this could impair my judgement playing this game but the sync really does mess this game up. If you play on the much lower resolution (640x480) these issues are almost non existient. It only happens at the higher resolutions. It could be solved by upgrading the computer not everyone has the money to do so. It's a thoughtful execution of a beloved Dreamcast game that falls short in many ways.","February 16, 2015","false","1.3"," 22 of 44 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","22","44","0","1"

The only problem is that the game doesn't always realize you pressed the button at the exact time you pressed it.\nSo instead of actually timing your button sequence right, you're better off pressing everything a little too early, which makes this rhythm game an absolute nightmare for everyone with some sort of feeling for rhythm.\n\nAlso the entire game is in Japanese with no subtitles whatsoever?!\nI have literally no clue what's going on in the so called "story mode".\nThen again all you ever do is dance so who really cares.\n\nThe co-op mode means that one person gets to press 4 out of the 6 buttons you need for the game, while the other player is in charge of the other two. You could just as well simply share a single controller.\n\nThis is probably the worst game I ever played in my life but the stupid dancing and ridiculous random stuff that's going on still makes it somewhat entertaining for a while when playing with a friend.\n\nNo way on earth is this game worth the 8€ it's listed as.

An "enemy" on screen says the command and performs the action, so if they're poiting up you have to correctly remember how long after their turn started to press up. They're there to assist you, but aren't all you need.\n\nThis adds to the original by varying up the gameplay a bit in a very natural and satisfying way. It's also chock full of secrets and extras.

It's really great until you get past the first level and the songs stop syncing up with the gameplay correctly. Still though, this came out when players weren't afraid to get a little bit of difficulty with their vidya, so if you're going for that nostalgic feel, then this is certainly a buy. Now that I'm thinking about it, Dreamcast games were never fun...","December 24, 2014","true","2.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

If you really break it down, Space Channel 5 isn't much more than a glorified version of Simon in a jetsons-esque retro future setting but in reality it is much more than that. It represents a lost era in gaming when music games were filled with crazy settings and ridiculous characters. Playing as a stylish news reporter that's saving lives one dance battle at a time is something that really could only happen in the dreamcast/ps2 era when budgets were less out of control. It's a game that is filled with a unique style and an inviting atmosphere focused on just having fun.

It's sort of like a mix of the Jetsons, West Side Story (or how I assume that musical is), and Simon. In terms of appearance, everything in this game would blend right in with the Jetsons; it has a very similar idea as to what the future will look like. The game is overdramatic and features group dancing against other dancing groups (that's what West Side Story is like, right?). As for the actual gameplay, it is a lot like the old game Simon in that it shows you a sequence, then you repeat it. However, unlike Simon, you have to match the rhythm as well. Between the awkward dialogue, the ridiculous concept, and the fun gameplay, this is a very ridiculous game that should keep anyone entertained.","March 8, 2011","true","13.1"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Have you ever wondered why <insert character here>  jumps, shoots, or simply starts walking, say, half a second late? This is called input lag. Our tv's do a little post processing to the signal that comes in and there for what you see in the screen is a little late to what actually is going on in the system or in out case, the computer. This post processing is absolutly FABULOUS for movies, but DETRIMENTAL to games such as space chanel five. most tv's now days have a "game mode" which disable most if not all the filtering and almost compleatly remove input lag. some TV's don't eliminate input lag very well at all, so be warned. If you dont see game mode, try disabling motion filters, noise filters and all dynamic this and that. to test take a game, lets say a mario something, <yes it happens with consoles like I said.> smack the shoot botton...no really smack it! make it sound of that TAP! if the tap sound sync to the shoot sound, your good! if it doesn't, you have contracted a deadly condition called input lag!","April 19, 2015","true","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

To put it simply, Space Channel 5 (both games) is very Japanese. Wild visuals, bright colors and it doesn't make a lot of sense. There's so much going on visually when it's really just a memory game. But it's not enough to memorize the patterns - you have to remember the rhythms too. And when the dance movements don't sync up with the voices and sounds, it's a lot more challenging than appearances imply.\n\nThis is, in all honesty, the first game series I've ever encountered where it is literally easier to play it with your eyes closed. When you don't have delayed dance moves throwing off your rhythm, you actually do better. Plus, you get to rescue Michael Jackson! This game can get frustrating, but it's unique and charmingly cheesy.","August 14, 2015","true","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I first heard about it through Project X Zone on the 3DS. I'm glad I did, I enjoyed this game quite a lot despite me not being too interested in rhythm games or SEGA games. I say all of this because it helps explain that I'm playing this game, not as an expert, but more of a novice or amateur.\n\nA general rule of thumb for me is that gameplay is most important, and neither voice acting nor visuals usually matter. My visual preference is cartoony, not realism, and so I feel that I should leave it off to limit bias as much as I can (Although, isn't bias the whole point of a review?) This is how it works for me specifically. Sorry if you disagree with that.\n\nFor a rhythm game, I feel that the order of importance for the review should be gameplay, music, and finally plot.\n\nGameplay: The gameplay is basic and easy to follow. You hit the 6 designated buttons when prompted in alignment with the beat of the music. If you are good at both timing and memory, and enjoy them, I'd recommend this game. The game's first two stages will give you a lot of leeway to make mistakes to get yourself situated with the game. All stages have segments that enough misses will cause you to fail the level and you can start from either a checkpoint or from the beginning, it's up to you.\n\nMusic: I am no music connoisseur, but I really like the soundtrack. I think it's supposed to sound like pop, but I think that because Space Michael, a major character in the game, is voiced by Michael Jackson. It's really catchy, so I didn't have much trouble following the beat.\n\nPlot: I won't give away spoilers, you can do it yourself by watching Youtube or similar video-sharing platforms if you wish. Going into a rhythm game or a Mario game for an interesting and deep story is like talking to a wall; You'll usually feel disappointment. The plot is easy to understand, quirky, random, not entirely logical, and pretty weird. I like it a lot.\n\nGameplay: 9/10\nMusic: 10/10\nPlot: 8/10\n\nOverall: 9/10\n\n(The following are just things about the game I found humorous. All things preceeding this is the actual serious review. I just wanted to be both serious and comical.)\nThings to expect:\nSaving everybody from dancing... by... dancing... some more...\nNews reporters dressed like pop stars.\nUlala's immense wardrobe.\nNews reporters with deadly lasers.\nShooting people with pink heart lasers to save them.\nEveryone does the hula hoop.\nGiant robots.\nRescuing the president.\nPlant monster predicament.\nPudding.\nRandom guitar battle... shouldn't we be saving the president...?\nThe level description for report 3 says "Meet the sexy space police."\nStrange coworkers.\nRescuing the rescue squad.\nWhy does the news reporting station need cheerleaders?\nSpace Michael.\nUlala fights 'Smooth Criminals' to save Space Michael.\nBattle of the bands.\nThe ending of the game if you miss the final cutscene button prompt.\nUlala does almost everything!","April 3","true","41.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is a fun game as long as you can get past some of the dificulties the game has in it. Unfortunately, as much as I love the game, I cannot fully recommend the game unless you are a fan.\n\nFirst off, this review was after the major patch Sega made that increased resolution and made several other changes to the game.\n\nThe controls to the game are simple. The villians do their part and all you have to do is repeat what they did including the deliberate pauses. You have the up, down, left, right, and two other buttons for a total of 6 possible moves. If your timing is good and you can get 100% the level rewards you with a new costume.\n\nThis is where I cannot recommend the game. A few patches has worked to syncing the game to the keyboard/controller but there are several areas where you will know that you pushed the button correctly and it did not register at the right moment, the sequence starts a split second after the villians even though they had a longer starting pause, or your part of the song is off sync with the music because of what your side says compared to the villians. At this point, it becomes more memorization than anticipation. Since this is the main focus of the game, I cannot fully recommend the game.\n\nGraphics wise, this is a port of a dreamcast game so you should not be expecting HD graphics. In fact, the original versions looked pretty much just like this. The fact that there is upscaling and V-sync is a bonus. One of the really interesting things is on some of the boss scenes the background moves in the same direction as the boss so you definitely know which move they did.\n\nThe music is a variety of upbeat songs some of which are from the original game. They do not stand out but are not overbearing. When playing through the game you will notice that same of the villians say "left" when they should be saying "right". This happens several times and with different villians. Also there is the character Pudding. During part of the game she is refered to as Padding (text and voice). While she is on stage the sign always says "Pudding".\n\nThere are several minor issues with the game. If you can figure out the sync issue in the game than it is a fun game. For $8 I cannot shoot it down to much.\n\nAlso, if you want to watch a perfect run Hold RB+LB+RT+LT while hitting B Y X, when it is your turn and the game will take over. You will hear Ulala's voice when you hit it correctly.","September 24, 2015","true","6.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In every sense of the word, UGA's Space Channel 5: Pt. 2 is a traditional sequel; it fixes everything about the first Dreamcast game and adds new content to enhance the dance madness.\nVisually, the port has several things straightened out from its original Dreamcast release.\nThe shimmering and aliasing have mostly vanished. The ungodly long load times have been made nearly seamless, and then there is all of the choreography,\n\nGroovy Outfits! There are modifications to some outfits, items, new characters, New game Plus and more.\nThis is sure to keep you busy if you are a completionist.\nLuckily, the grind for "Perfect ranks" are not so bad as players can soft save from midway through a level.\nThe game also crashes and freezes less on PC than the older Dreamcast equivalent.\n(However, this may be due to hardware limitations of early to late 90's hardware.)\n\nEnvironments and Art! The level design on a visual scale is classic. If the settings seemed unrealistic and weird before, the at times odd designs of space stations, rivers, schools and arboretums has a unique look in Space Channel 5: Pt. 2.\nThe environments are more colorful, offer more polygons and are more interactive. And they're filled with cheap but likeable puns and jokes.\n\n??? At one point in the story, a giant plant who's captured the Space President manages to capture Ulala....\nDuring this scene, the main villain Peace / Purge, uses the plants slimy tentacle like vines to grab Ulala. When she is grabbed in the Japanese and English dub, she says: "Oooooohhh, not there!" however this does not last long  as she naturally frees herself unprodded.  Though the entire scene is very odd, it is done in such a manner that it still makes me laugh!\n\nVerdict! UGA and SEGA have done an amazing job of porting both dubs for the pc market as it is almost the exact same dub as my original Dreamcast version (with a few things censored).\nWith regard to the gameplay, the tweaks and additions make Space Channel 5: Pt. 2 a far superior game to the first game in the series and more importantly, the original Dreamcast version.\nUlala's animations are more responsive, the animations are so quick that they never overlap with the upcoming beat.\n\nOverall, Space Channel 5: Part 2 is a great port.\nThere are a few blemishes on Ulala's PC record such as the invisible models and sound issues, but it makes little impact to the experience.\nFor a retro game, it holds up verry well.\n\nScore:\n8 / 10","October 19, 2015","true","6.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

To put it simply, Space Channel 5 (both games) is very Japanese. Wild visuals, bright colors and it doesn't make a lot of sense. There's so much going on visually when it's really just a memory game. But it's not enough to memorize the patterns - you have to remember the rhythms too. And when the dance movements don't sync up with the voices and sounds, it's a lot more challenging than appearances imply.\n\nThis is, in all honesty, the first game series I've ever encountered where it is literally easier to play it with your eyes closed. When you don't have delayed dance moves throwing off your rhythm, you actually do better. Plus, you get to rescue Michael Jackson! This game can get frustrating, but it's unique and charmingly cheesy.","August 14, 2015","true","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Dance to fight off the baddies? Oh well, anyways, you use up/down/right/left + "chu" (?) and "hey" in the order and with the timing the baddie (or not) does it. Sounds easy? Of course it doesn't. Sometimes you even have super ultra epic instrument battles!\n\nSo you move through a level and you have encounters with... Someone. You copycat 'em and if you fail with even just one thing in the sequence (multiple sequences in one encounter), you lose a heart. You have limited amount of 'em. You even have viewer rating, which shows how good or bad you are (mostly the latter probably)\n\nThis game is actually rather fun, even though it sounds a tad silly.

Why can't you make more games like this? Why do you insist on milking the blue chinchilla than make more of this trippy ♥♥♥♥?\n\nSpace Channel 5 is a rythmic simon says game. It's not that hard, but it's bizarre on so many levels, I love it. It is a visual trip down 70's to early 2000's blend of fashion and dance. If you're wondering if you need to play the first game, you don't need to, it's essentially the same. Though I do recommend the first one if you have the right system. Either way it's a weird as hell game and it's fun. I got this in the dreamcast collection on sale, and I suggest waiting for a price drop. It's a fairly short game, but fun either way.","March 24","true","4.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you're a fan of rhythm games in general and are looking to expand your library, I'd recommend this one. Rather than a constant feed of input like for example Guitar Hero, this game has more of a Simon Says approach, which is alright. Timings can be just a tad weird sometimes, and overall the game is pretty damn short, drawing most of it's replayability through getting perfect scores and unlockables.\n\nOther than that, it's pretty charming, but expect a lot of classic japanese rando humor (and naturally a tentacle scene).\n\nTechnical Issue:\nBe wary of tabbing down this game while playing as it can make some syncing issues occur, as well as mess with the loading of in-game art assets.","January 22","true","6.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But it is too difficult for modern players. I guess most player would not even be able to pass the 2nd level. The translation is also an issue, especially the voices. Their Japanese accent made it very difficult to distinguish Left and Right just by listening. In sum, it is very good for its cinematic performances and its innovative gameplay compared to traditional rhythm games. However, it is not recommended for average players.","November 30, 2015","false","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That's the sound of failure and you'll hear that a lot while playing this game.\n\nI love rhythm games. From Dance Dance Revolution to Just Dance and everything in between, if it's got a good soundtrack and good controls I am there playing (or failing) to my heart's content. I have a history with space channel 5, since I played it on the PlayStation2 as a package ( the original and part 2) and although the game was a hard as hell simon says rhythm game with no prompts other than “memorize these moves or kiss your ratings goodbye” I welcomed the challenge. Nothing made me happier than beating both games the first time as a kid and I was the rhythm queen!\n\nSo when my friends gifted me space channel 5 part 2 on steam I was so excited to revisit Ulala and save space Michael Jackson all over again. When I played the first stage a number of concerns ran through my mind as the intro started playing. The first one being:\n\n1. Why is this not in HD?\n\nThe game starts and I quickly figure out the commands for CHU and HEY are S and D. Not really the best setup when on a keyboard which led to my next concern.\n\n2. I can't customize my input style? Oh man I'm gonna ruin my S and D keys by the time this is over with.\n\nDespite getting used to the keyboard controls it was overall enjoyable...and then came the second stage: the space park...aquarium..garden place and oh god was it painful. Most people that play this know about stage 2 because the guitar battle with Pudding this was my favorite part of the stage. I say was because I quickly found out about the keyboard's unresponsive commands in the worst way possible. The part I could easily do on console with flair turned into frustration and borderline rage. Pudding wiped the floor with me when before I could do it perfectly. My hands were tired so I took a break, and closed the game, knowing that the game auto saves once you clear a stage. Only to come back to it days later to realize NONE of my progress was saved. NONE OF MY PROGRESS WAS SAVED.\n\nThis raised huge a red flag for me. Despite me only losing stage 1 progress I know how difficult and long the later stages get. And yes, its possible to do this whole game in one setting but I don't recommend it. The people you save, the costumes you unlock the secrets you find will not save at all. Meaning you could play this game perfectly get to the end and then never be able to play a new game with a different outfit unless you just leave the game running.\n\nNo, that's unforgivable. Ulala, get your act together. This is not how a famous space reporter should represent themselves on steam. There have been updates that help with a few of these problems but the game is still not smooth enough for me to recommend it with a clear conscious. Sorry Ulala, I'm canceling your show.","January 1, 2014","false","18.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I don't even mind the fact that the dialogue is in Japanese. What I do mind, though, is that the keyboard controls don't work, and you can't change them. In the very first level of this game, I couldn't get Ulala to do more than one of any action - up or down or chu. No matter how many times I pressed the corresponding keys, she would either stay still or there would be a big delay. I really do like this game, but I just can't recommend it because I can't play it, and I kind of doubt these issues will be fixed any time soon. It seems that others have similar issues.","May 18","false","7.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game has a "customization" file that you can run when you start the game--I have to load that every time I play the game and toggle English-->Japanese-->English to get it to load in English.\n\n* The audio settings seem to determine which of my two monitors it loads on. What?!\n\n* SEVERE input lag on controllers. This thing *hates* my Xbox controller. I have no idea why.\n\n* I had a lot more luck using the keyboard, but come on. It's a keyboard. That's not how I want to experience this game. And besides, even that gives me problems, though I don't know if it's lagging or if I just suck at using the keyboard.\n\nThis is a wonderful, fun, hilarious game, but this isn't the best version.","June 5","false","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
