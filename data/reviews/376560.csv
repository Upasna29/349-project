"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lillje/recommended/376560/","lillje","Lilly (✿◠‿◠)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lillje/","2609 products in account","Big Fish Legend is a cute casual side-scrolling platformer game that incorporates a few easy puzzle elements.\n\nIn each of the 60 levels that the game offers, you guide the kitty to the exit, jumping from platform to platform or vertically climbing walls (it's a cat after all, cats can always do funny stunts), collecting gems on the way that replenish the kitty's life. There are various monsters to defeat by jumping on them using different mechanics. Indicators that show which way to go are present in almost every screen, so it's quite easy to find the exit; however, the way is sometimes blocked by doors that need to be open either by collecting a key or by pushing an object on the button that controls the door, triggering it to open. And this is where the puzzle element comes into the picture - you need to bring those objects to the right location and sometimes this requires a bit of planning ahead, making use of the surroundings and a few timed jumps.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=491914139\nThe collision is quite good in the game and the levels are designed so that the objects don't get stuck in weird places; and even if a ball appears to not be movable because it ended up in a tight place, it's enough for the cat to push against it a bit for the ball to start moving due to its inertia.\n\nThe difficulty of the levels is rather constant, there's no increase apart from a few special ones that are timed or in which you have to avoid damaging the monsters; however not even those are very challenging and are easily done after 2 or 3 tries. This makes the game accessible not only to casual gamers, but to children too, despite the fact that it's not a kids game.\n\nThe aspect in which Big Fish Legend is lacking though is the story. I would have loved a more detailed one instead of the 3 comic book pages that the game offers.\n\nDespite the fact that the game's legitimacy on Steam is heavily debated on the forums and despite the fact that the developers did some unprofessional things for promoting it, I think this is a very enjoyable game. I consider the asking price to be way too high for what the game itself offers, but I appreciate the fact that they provided thousands of copies through giveaways in order to fix their mistakes.\n\nMore reviews on the Lilly's Corner Curator page","August 1, 2015","true","20.7"," 28 of 34 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","28","34","0","9"

You are scored points based on how well you accomplish each of these individual tasks, once you reach the end of the level gate. The game is very straight forward and simple. It is played using the mouse and takes a moment to adjust to not using the keyboard. The mazes seem pretty simplistic, although I would imagine the higher levels offer more complexity. Timing jumps is key to acquiring all the jewels and reaching some spots necessary to earn gold in a level, so you may end up practicing a timed jump a few times before you are able to do it. The graphics are very simple, the music isn't overly annoying, All in all, not a bad game.","October 19, 2015","true","22.2"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ladyoberon/recommended/376560/","ladyoberon","LadyOberon [#GamersRule]","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ladyoberon/","2871 products in account","I cannot recommend this game to the gaming population in general, or even platformer enthusiasts in general. I can only honestly recommend this game for a very specific type of player.\n\nThe game should appeal to younger gamers and those looking for a very casual gaming experience, and even more specifically, players that won't mind, or won't notice, the "cookie-cutter" level design that is repetitious and unimaginative.\n\nHowever, there is an additional issue with the controls and the texture of the surfaces. That issue is that the surfaces provide absolutely no traction or resistance, meaning that the entire game is like playing an "ice" world/level in another game. This can be challenging and fun in small doses, but when a game is like that in its entirety, especially when it's obviously suited for younger and/or casual gamers, it doesn't make sense.\n\nDuring my gameplay, I had extreme difficulty with this, because the character slides when you're not touching the controls, causing the cat to slip right over the edge of very short horizontal ledges and surfaces and to slide down on vertical surfaces.\n\nWall-jumping mechanics are also flawed here because of this slippage. It's difficult to jump from one vertical surface to another without sliding backwards or overshooting entirely.\n\nI also noticed that the jump height and distance were inconsistent. At times, the cat jumped higher or further than it did during consecutive attempts in the same spot, and I couldn't figure out a reason for that other than design flaw. I didn't find a double jump, high jump, or sprint capability, so that didn't explain it, either.\n\nI was also disappointed by the poor grammar and spelling, which was distracting to me and seems likely due to poor English translation.\n\nGamers looking for an immersive storyline in which to engage will not find that here. That aspect was also way below the average "grab the coins/gems" jumping platformers. As one who sometimes just wants to play a game without having to think too much, I can appreciate why the level design and problem solving/strategy aspects might have been purposely simplistic, but when the design itself or game mechanics, such as movement and controls, introduce illogical and inconsistent difficulty, that appreciation for a purposeful decision is replaced by disappointment for error and/or complacency. The resulting confusion and frustration completely negate any appreciation.\n\nI actually had this game on my wishilist and was very happy to see it come up in a recent bundle offer. If I'd paid full price for this game, I'd be much more disappointed than I am, and most likely very upset.\n\nIf you can find the game for a buck or two (or included in a bundle) and the issues I've mentioned don't deter you, then this may in fact be a game for you to try. On the other hand, if you're seeking consistency, high replayability, immersive storyline, a challenging puzzle platformer, or unique level design, then you're best looking elsewhere.","February 18","false","3.3"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","11","17","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dandk/recommended/376560/","dandk","Dan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dandk/","1554 products in account","A very interesting casual platformer game that appeals to people looking for a product quirky, simple and relaxed in difficulty to pass some time, best played in smaller intervals as there are elements of repetition. The overall goal is to bring the main character, a charming kitten, across 60 levels of various difficulty, with small variations such as time limits or without killing any monsters.\n\nThe levels gradually introduce more game mechanics as the game slowly becomes increasingly challenging, but largely remain within a few minutes of length, including fairly simple puzzle solving that requires fetching keys or manipulating boulders to push buttons to open doors, or grabbing a key item to unlock the exit gate. At the end of each game world, a boss fight occurs.\n\nGameplayControls\nThe main issue about the game itself is its control scheme. You can choose to control the kitty with either the keyboard or mouse. The cat moves frictionlessly on both air and ground, making each command feel as if you are navigating on slippery ice, and making air control almost impossible. Using a mouse, you obtain precise movement control but it becomes almost impossible to control jumps as the cat will attempt to follow your cursor immediately after the jump.\n\nSpeaking of jumping, the kitten automatically clings to walls and ropes when touching them, and if your jump button is held for one second longer than that, it immediately jumps off again. This means that to control your jumps you have to press the button before you hit a wall/rope and then let go of the button the second before you hit it, then climb it and hit the button again. If you are not used to this, you will be in trouble. (Ordinary platformers negate the jump input until you release and press the button again.)\n\nGenerally speaking, the combination of lack of air and jump control causes much frustration as you will repeatedly fail the occasional tricky jump and even more frequently get hit by monsters by not approaching them from the correct angle (from above) and feel stupid. While it could be argued that this adds a challenge to the game, no player would appreciate fake difficulty stemming from poor programming. As the creators of SMB put it, real difficulty must give the player full control and responsibility for his mistakes. In other words, input must be responsive, and this isn't (or you could say that it is way too responsive/sensitive).\n\nGeneral\nThe game keeps a fair learning curve introducing monsters and mechanics very gradually, even considering the added difficulty from the suboptimal controls. If you die, you respawn at the beginning or at a nearby checkpoint saving all progress you made through the level. One life lasts you about five hits from any hazards, and you carry excess lives across levels (as well as getting fully healed when completing a level).\n\nBy collecting the generous amount of gems scattered in each level and defeating monsters, you obtain points, which aside from giving you a pointless rating at the end of each level (outside achievements bounds, even) gives you a health effect for each 20,000 points collected in that level. Finding a heart power-up gives you the same effect. I say 'health effect' because there is a hefty problem here. See, if you happen to be at full health when getting point no. 20,000 or picking up a heart, you gain an extra life. If not, then it simply heals you. No matter how close you were to full health. This means that essentially, unless you happen to be at full health at the right time, you are 'wasting' part of the effect for no reason. This is a serious design flaw. Combined with how easy it is to get accidentally get hit by monsters, good luck picking up that last gem or heart for an extra life without getting it wasted for nothing.\n\nLast but not least, since 20,000 is the key amount of points, any number of leftover points at the end of a level that doesn't divide cleanly by this amount is used for absolutely nothing (apart from the aforementioned rating). An interesting note is that they do actually accumulate between levels, but the 20,000 needed for health always counts from 0 when starting a new level.\n\nA quick note on game physics: On top of our kitty vertically climbing walls (which due to clever design is not as much of an overpowered trait as it sounds) it can also push boulders around with the same ease as if they were made of papier-mâché. On the other hand, this prevents them for getting stuck in corners, but they are seriously hard to balance on.\n\nAs the player progresses in the game, most trophies and their mirrored Steam achievements will unlock, and some of them actually provides you with upgraded abilities, such as the possibility to look down (largely useless) and killing certain monsters faster.\n\nStoryAs most people will notice, the English translation is severely lacking, which contributes negatively to the overall experience, though in its defense it is clearly understandable and doesn't hamper the story as much as it could have, especially during in-game tutorial messages. On the other hand, this is also because the story is mostly non-existent and just an excuse plot for sending our furry protagonist on a platformy journey. Which doesn't have to be all that bad, since it is a platformer after all, but it has to be said. The comic style cinematics are few (only between worlds) and neither original or visionary. 'Decent' is a generous word here.\n\nGraphicsFor a pure 2D platformer, the simplistic and cute art style is generally appealing, with the colourful game world, protagonist and various inhabitants, background assets and items blending nicely together. It is easy to plan your navigation, in theory at least. Unfortunately, the overall state of the game prevents it from serving more usefulness.\n\nMediaApart from the above mentioned cutscenes, the game provides generic music for each of the three game worlds and the boss fights. It is nothing noteworthy but serves its purpose for setting the atmosphere and keeping it lively. Sound effects are standard on-hit noises and bouncy jumps.\n\nAchievementsThe poor translation makes it really hard to figure out some of the achievements but they seem to all naturally unlock during a normal playthrough, as long as you kill most of the enemies on the way. For achievement hunters, it should be a walk in the park if you are strong enough to endure the game till its completion.\n\nOverallI originally gave this game a chance because of its charming looks and casual attitude and would still recommend it to players that are looking for a relaxing platformer for recreational purposes or whatever. However, due to its incredibly sloppy controls, I am starting to fear that even this target group will instead experience unreasonable frustration, and they might as well rather feel that frustration playing a harder game with better responsiveness. If you happen to own the game already, I encourage you to give it a try and see for yourself, but otherwise I cannot advise you to obtain it. It is dangerously mediocre and there are many better alternatives out there.\n\n\nPros        Cons                Cute graphics        Frustrating controls                Relaxing difficulty        Health design flaws                Smooth level design        Generic content                        Poor translation                        Uninteresting story\nGameplay: 4/10\nStory: 5/10\nGraphics: 7/10\nMedia: 5/10\n\nOverall: 4/10","August 3, 2015","false","5.6"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","6","12","0","0"

So the game is a 2D platformer. You are a kitten, that has to master many diffrent levels while collecting gems and killing enemies (similar to Super Mario). The ambient music is great. However, you really need to get used to the controls. You can either use your mouse, or your WASD keys. I prefer the mouse though. The game is really cute, and I definitely recommend it for children.\nMany people claim, this game is overpriced. But I think 7 Euros is just fine.

If you really feel the need to buy this game, make sure to get it on sale or in a bundle, it is NOT worth full price.","March 10","false","9.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
