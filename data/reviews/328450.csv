Only buy if you run Windows 7 or lower.*\n\nThis game is awesome. Just plain awesome. I must have played 1000 hours of this in middle school and high school.\n\nIt's not terribly complex, but its complex enough that it doesn't feel simple either. It's an expand and conquest game, similar to Civ and other turn based strategy games. Where Deadlock shines so brightly, though, is in its charm.\n\nEach of the alien races is a delight. The have a huge array of custom taunts, praises, cowers, and insults which they occasionally lob throughout the game. The races are all unique and don't feel repetetive at all. Even after almost 20 years since playing it regularly, this game sticks in my memory as one of the best I have ever played.\n\nI was so glad to see it here on Steam, so I picked it up immediately. I look forward once again to long LAN parties and crushing my enemies with Tarth troopers!","October 27, 2014","true","0.6"," 38 of 40 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","38","40","0","2"

Really good 4x strategy game. Battles (which are usually the most tedious part of these types of games) are auto-battled, so don't expect dexterity or battle tactics to matter at all, it's mostly about resource management, base building, diplomacy, espionage and tech trees. I still like the tech tree more in this game than in any other I've played.","December 12, 2014","true","0.2"," 21 of 23 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","21","23","0","0"

Such a great game!\nDon't expect the AI to be super deep. They are not that smart, but they still are hard.\nIt's great fun to spend some time.

Deadlock II is basically Deadlock with an expansion pack, so not much new here if you've played Deadlock - but a few nice nice fixes and additions.\n\nThis is the game I go to when I'm craving oldschool strategy.","February 5","true","7.7"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

As far as mechanics, it is a 4x game where several alien species land on a single planet, and then battle it out for global domination.  You build up your colony, expand and colonize additional areas, build an army and fight with your enemies.  Fairly simple at its core, but what makes it special is that this basic formula is done just right.\n\nEach species has its own unique abilities and traits, and each really has very distinct advantages.  Even the humans, which in most games is the "average race" has very special abilities that no other race has, including a berserk ability for infantry, and very high taxes and trade.  Re-lu begin seeing the whole map, and so they know the composition and strength of enemy forces long before the assault has begun, and they can subvert enemy morale with their spies, leading to riots and much destruction of property.  There is really no average race, which is nice as a change of pace.  Each race also has a major penalty associated with it, such as with the Re-lu, weak military units and defenses, or with the humans, extremely expensive military maintenance.  There are 5 other races with equally interesting advantages and disadvantages.\n\nThe arguably worst feature of this game is the battles themselves.  You can watch them, but you have no control, and units often move around the battlefield in odd ways.  There is also some degree of luck involved because units have "accuracy," i.e., they just miss sometimes.  Nevertheless, the automated battles means you can focus on the more strategic elements of the game, rather than the nitty gritty tactical, which speeds up games substantially.  Personally, I don't mind it.  But if you are looking for Command and Conquer, this is simply not that.\n\nThe tech tree is functional, and depending on the map type (mostly land/mostly sea) and world type (alien, earth-like, volcanic, etc.) you will need to adapt your selections.  This is a refreshing change from games where you always research the same techs, no matter what.  You can still sort of get away with this in singleplayer, but you must adapt in multiplayer to have any chance at survival in a competitive game.\n\nAnd this brings me to multiplayer. In full disclosure, I have mostly only played 1v1 matches with the non-steam version, so I can't make any guarantees with the connection capabilities of the steam version.   I use Hamachi (free) to make the TCP-IP connection function. But wow is multiplayer wonderful.  I have played dozens of extremely close games, and you really feel the tension build as forces maneuver around the seas or make surprise land assaults with illegally purchased Skirineen Veterans.  Or subvert your morale... or poison food at just the wrong moment...  Or blockade you cutting off much needed food and energy to your colony (starvation and powered down defenses).  The point here is that there is substantial strategic and tactical depth here that really shows in multiplayer, and to me this makes multiplayer the best part.\n\nAnd another thing is that even after years of play, I am still discovering things I never knew.  Did you know that submarines have special abilities?  Did you know you can maximize taxes on every colony on the Cyth from turn 1 with no penalty because of their unique static morale ability to generate a ton of cash from the start?\n\nI would almost say it is a game that is deceptively simple.  Something can easily learn, but hard to truly master.  If you've never played it, I highly recommend it.  If you have played, I hope to see you in a game.\n\nJust a warning, I have been unable to make this work on Windows 8+, so be wary if that is your system.","December 29, 2015","true","0.1"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

I'm still learning and relearning Deadlock II I can already tell it has a lot more features I wasn't expecting like being able to build on water now.\n\nAll and all it a classic and I think anyone who likes colony space strategy builders should give it a try.\n\n\nIt does take a bit of a learning curv to learn and mico order all your units though so be aware of that. It offers mulit player I can play with people in my same State but haveing problems playing with my steam friends maybe somone can figure that out for us.","October 27, 2014","true","4.9"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","8","11","0","0"

Bought and installed, loaded and got a "Direct Draw Init FAILURE" notification.\n\nTo bypass this, simply go to the source folder and locate the Deadlock.exe file. Right-click and under the compatibility tab you will check the box to run it in compatibility mode and set it for a verson of Windows that itsn't Win8 or Win95. All others are okay. Once this is set, run as administrator and it'll work. Now the only problem to get past is the black screen which has to do with the refresh rate.\n\nAt this time, I do not recommend buying the game.","December 14, 2014","false","29.3"," 16 of 28 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","16","28","0","1"

Menus are not as intuitive as the first Deadlock game, but the game overrall is an improvement over the formula. You can have more units on the map, for example.

Simple-ish, relaxing, and short game sessions for me which I personally find highly replayable.\n\nThis game looks very intimidating initially, even having played Deadlock 1 when I was much younger. UI is cluttered with buttons, game can be micromanagement heavy, and lots of things aren't clear.\n\nFor quick and easy fun I recommend, starting from the main menu,\n\nNew Single Player Game\nRandom Scenario\nCity center win condition against 1 AI opponent\nCustom Planet then at least 50% wasteland with a higher percentage of plains and forests\nSelect plains or forests as the starting base location\nOnce you're in the actual game I recommend starting by building a farm, house, and university asap. Then try to acquire an income for all the basic resources (food, wood, energy, iron) as soon as possible. As turns go by you can manage your settlement however you like.\n\nIf this kind of game is fun and interesting to you then you're welcome to replay and experiment with different decisions which I did alot of. Practice also helped me play more efficiently and finish games in much less time. There's also some in-game help information (the question mark button) that I found useful.\n\nThis is my favourite game in my steam library at the time of this review.","June 5","true","49.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
