Here is my report of the first two days.\n\nDay One:\n\nI started the shift out finding illegal parked cars and writing tickets.  I spent about two hours (game time) doing this when I received a call from dispatch stating there was a report nearby of two people vandalizing a building.  I then turned on my lights and sirens and sped to the location where the report was.  At first I did not find anything as I approched people to gather more information two indvidivauls, a male and female, began to run from me.  I pursued the male on foot calling out to him to him that I was the police and to stop!.  After about a 20 mins foot chase (game time) He finally gave up and I found drug paraphernalia on him and subsequently arrested him.  I radioed dispatch for a van to come take him away to jail.  I then went back to the scene of the crime and found the female not too far away.  She gave up immediately.  I took her into custody and transported her back to the police station.\n\nEnd of shift\n\nDay 2:\n\nI started off doing speed traps on a rural road for about 3 hours (game time) when I got a transmission from dispatch about a theft that just occured.  I turned on my lights and sirens and arrived at scene to a crying female.  I interviewed her and she gave me an accurate discription of the suspect that took her purse.  I subsequent search of the area I found the male traveling west on the southern most road of town.  I stopped him and idetified myself and he gave up.  I found drugs and further evidence on this subject.  I arrested him and took him to the police station.  After I cleared I noticed a car traveling and a high rate of speed and swerving back and forth.  I activated my lights and sirens and pulled over the car.  The driver was IDed and found that there was problems with his documentation.  I tickted him and cleared the traffic stop.  I then received a call from dispatch of suspcious drug actvity in town.  I then arrived and found the suspected person in the middle of a park.  I walked slowly towards him and IDed myself as a police officer.  The defendeant then pulled a firearm on me and shot twice.  I pulled my service weapon, shot and killed him.  I then called an ambulance to come and clear the scene.\n\n9/10  Would kill drug dealers again\n\nRe-Edit to the trolls* To those trolls who say 1.8 hours.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/codamadius/recommended/318220/","codamadius","Frillin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/codamadius/","139 products in account","Developers\nBefore I go into my review I need to tell you all some things. To put this in the nicest way possible, the developers are an unprofessional, and hypocritical team of failures. If you go into the forums or look at their facebook page you will notice that any negativity against them will result in a "professional" and instant lash towards you. In the community forums you will notice that they have whined about negativity towards their "finished game". You will also notice that they say they will listen and answer everyone who has a question. I have asked a couple of questions and got no answers from the developers. Only answers from other community members telling me that they do not answer anyone. This game has been abandoned for quite some time and left with bugs and barely any gameplay to justify the price. As far as we're all concerned, they're back to just fix the bugs, add a "sandbox" mode and then throw their hands up and be done with it.  I have been banned from the forums yesterday after talking about a promising sounding new police simulator called 'Police 10-13'. Apparently they can't answer questions, but do visit the forums frequently to find an excuse to ban people that don't hold their game in high regards. To be fair, part of what I talked about was how the developers making 10-13 are making themselves look and I quote "like idiots" because there are multiple things they are doing that professionals wouldn't do. And the ban is fair according to the rules. In short, I'm iffy about it like I should be after this farce. Only time will tell and I am still excited to see the news and its development.\n\nWith this said about the developers, please be very cautious about their new project 'CTU' (Counter Terrorism Unit). These developers are childish and are untrustworthy.\nStory The only story there is is a quick intro scene saying that your father was great at being a police officer. After that you're thrown in with a pop up text tutorial and you figure out the rest.\n\nGameplay While it's clearly clunky and buggy, it is fun for a while. I put in 8 hours before getting very bored. I went back into the game to see if anything was changed or added despite what people said just to make sure, and nothing has been done. All there is is just a few cars you unlock by entering 'codes'. Your duties will differ. You will give chase on foot, get into gunfights, set up speedometers, arrest drunks and those that have harmed others and sometimes break and enter homes that have been reported to have someone armed and dangerous. It's realistic to a very small degree and has potential. Before the game was released, it had a different name and had a lot more going in (more buildings, looked much more polished, basically everything that makes a game look good to hype it up in the beginning). If all that was there it would be really good.\n\nSound Voice acting is terrible, music is very dull and on repeat, guns don't sound right etc. The sound isn't terrible, but it isn't good. And all of the talking past the introduction is silent and through text.\n\nGraphics  The graphics are basically a more polished GTA: San Andreas. Lighting is better and textures are smoother but not by much. It looks like one of the later PS2 games.\n\nOverall It's good in short bursts if you don't care for too much content but the bugs will irritate you enough to not want to play. With Police 10-13 planning on coming sometime in 2016 I would hold off. And there are other simulators much better than this one. The GTA IV police mod is the best one and there's an older and sillier simulation that feels complete as well called Police Force if you don't want to wait. But this "simulator" is worth $5 at best and even real police officers are voicing how bad this is. Get a better simulator or hold off for Police 10-13.\n\nSmall Immediate Edit I've had this review written out for quite some time and could not post it up until now and have no idea why and so I saved it and waited. Now that I've finally been able to post it, please spread the word about not getting this game at any price. I have never fallen victim to bad developers as I'm usually good about asking for opinions and looking at whether the business is professional as well up until now. And again, it isn't because I was banned from the forums. I have nothing personal against that. Just their empty promises, lack of news and refusal to keep an open mind and accept the fact that not everyone will be happy and they screwed up badly is why I am bashing them directly. I hope my review helps and happy gaming!","January 4","false","8.9"," 124 of 141 people (88%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","88","124","141","9","11"

I arrived on scene to two gentlemen fleeing in opposite directions prompting me to give chase. I pull my firearm and demand the suspect to stop, an order he replies too by drawing his own firearm prompting me once again to take action, this time to defend my life and lives of other citizens. I quickly empty my magazine into the suspect to no avail, he must have been using some sort of dark magic or incantation to sheild himself from my rounds as they had no effect on him at point blank range. I retreat, having been hit by the suspect and brought close to the cold death of realistic mode, to cover and grab my MP5 I obviously keep in my back pocket (not complaining, most games do this) and unleash a torrent of bullets.... Once again to no avail... In an attempt not to be killed in the line of duty two hours into my career by an enchanted magic man I sprint to my patrol car while dodging his bullets. Once in my cruiser, I turn on my lights, sirens, and punch the gas in an attempt to run the magic man over.... It only worsened the situation... Once struck by my police car at aproximately 75 MPH the suspect was propelled into orbit, though only for a breif time before he re-entered Earth's atmosphere at super sonic speed and landing on my patrol car (totalling it). Refusing to die to this other worldly being I promptly exited the game so I could respawn in the safety of my home.\n\n\nWhile glitches are present in the game, the dedicated staff/developers and their desire to improve the game is comforting. It can get a little monotonous at times but once you step away for an hour or two you can't help yourself from wanting to play more. As long as the staff/developers of this game stay as active as they are (also, if they give us multiplayer and put the game on the Steam Workshop) I have no reason to doubt the potential of this game.\n\n8/10 (mainly due to bugs): Would Patrol Again","October 28, 2014","true","11.4"," 113 of 137 people (82%) found this review helpful 37 people found this review funny","82","113","137","37","11"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/djsoulfck/recommended/318220/","djsoulfck","DJSF - off @ twitch.tv/sinlike","http://steamcommunity.com/id/djsoulfck/","416 products in account","I hadn't purchased a game for full price in a long while, but was itching to try this one after watching Robbaz's (YouTuber) playthrough for it. I saw that it was on sale via the Humbebundle store for $14.99, so I purchased it there.\n\nThe game is really fun, and if you like police simulators at all, you will enjoy this game - I will continue to play it and see how it develops. Unfortunately, however, I have to leave this at a "do not recommend," because I feel very disappointed at the product I was presented with. The simplest way for me to have given Enforcer a "thumbs up," would be for the developers to have this labelled as an early access/beta game. As an avid game reviewer, I CANNOT support this type of presentation. I have a fairly massive backlog of games in my library left to review (on top of my backlog of games to play), but I decided to bump this up to the very top, because I want as many people to avoid making the mistake I made in buying this game AND believing it to be a final, finished product. I went ahead and tried it out despite many of the negative reviews, but I implore everyone and anyone interested to wait to see whether or not the game actually develops further.\n\nBecause quite obviously, this is a largely unfinished, barebones product. It both plays and feels like an early access game, and I would know, since I had a pretty potent early access game phase. Unlike the cesspool that is Starbound, I sincerely hope that the developers for Enforcer continue to work on the game, as it definitely has a lot of potential.\n\nNow, on to the meat of the review.\n\nThe aesthetics are good, the detail in the environment and character models are decent. The rain effects are pretty weak, and there the vehicle damage is insignificant. There seems to be a very low pool of character models, with the main difference being the color of their outfits. The vehicle pool is also considerably tiny, and you will notice this very quickly. The sounds and music are average, but I prefer to play my own instead. While in your police cruiser, there will be chatter over the radio, but (again) that pool appears to also be small, so you will notice repetitions within the first hour of playing.\n\nThe controls may take a bit of effort to get used to - there is a pop-up help menu right when you begin, and a super quick tutorial after you select your character sex and name. The help menu also provides descriptions for most of the things you can currently do in the world, and I strongly recommend you take a look through everything to properly orient yourself in the Enforcer world. The learning curve is minimal to moderate, depending on your experience with police simulators. You can play the game on normal or realistic mode, the latter having permanent death and more rapid/frequent missions for you to do.\n\nI've played this game quite a bit and enjoyed it a lot, however, many of the game elements show the unpolished quality common in early access game builds. For example, the AI is very basic, and many times you might ask a car to pull over, only to have them rear-end another car. Of course, the sloppiness of the AI will fool you, as this event will NOT constitute as an offence of any sort (at least on top of whatever offence that particular NPC might already have committed). I've seen a car speed through a red light and drive straight into a civilian crossing the street (not hurting the walker in any way, oddly enough) and - after pulling him over - the only recorded offence was speeding.\n\nWhen you pull over vehicles - you can do so by toggling your cruiser's warning siren, or calling out on foot - you will be given a few options like: apply breathalyzer, write ticket, and check license and registration (this will show you any offences the driver has committed). Something I don't really like about the latter feature is that you can set up traffic cones to create a roadblock, then go through an endless lineup of cars and spam the "check license and registration" option. Even if the car had been speeding blocks away from you, you will magically know that they were speeding with your omniscient police powers. Note, that this is also a pretty cheap way to farm police points, which contribute to your police ranking (the higher your ranking, the more money you make after each shift, and the larger the variety of missions available to you).\n\nAfter pulling people over, you can arrest drunk drivers and either put them in your squadcar (to take them to the police station), walk them to the station, or call a police van. Calling a police van, ambulance, or tow truck will bring you to a loading-type screen, and everything will occur behind-the-scenes, then bring you back to real-time. I don't mind this, considering how quickly you can pull over and check cars. Some NPCs might flee if you ask then to step out of the vehicle, and a quick taser shot will make them complaint again. Abusing your power (shooting them again with the taser, or even using your pistol) will cause considerable penalties to your police score.\n\nOne thing that really irritates me about this game is that it seems to only register "lethal force" as acceptable if the NPC shoots at you first. So, they can pull out and aim a gun at you, but until they shoot, you best use a taser, or worse - wait. NPCs commonly drop their weapons after taking one or two shots, and you MUST arrest them after this, or incur a penalty. I tried using a taser just to make sure they would remain complaint after the criminal dropped his gun, but received a heavy penalty for power abuse (annoyed me quite a bit). I also had a scenario where 2 NPCs were shooting at me (I still used only my pistol and not my sub-machinegun) - I killed the first person, and received a penalty for killing the second person because he hadn't fired at me yet. The crime/consequence algorithms can use a lot of refinement. It takes about two shots for you to die/be hospitalized, and the only way to heal is to sleep in your bed, or pay a fee at the hospital. Respawning (if you are playing normal) results in a considerable penalty to your police score.\n\nI've taken a screenshot of a parked car hovering in the air, stuck in an odd position. I gave it a ticket and towed it - scoring some points. As I continued playing, I was disappointed to see so many cars randomly stuck in the air, at different elevations. Clearly, the bugginess throughout the game should speak volumes regarding its quality as a finished product.\n\nYou are the ONLY police officer in the small city (map is split into grids, and you can travel to each one by driving - or teleport whenever you leave your house).\n\nThere are three meters you must take care of - energy, hunger, and stress, You can eat while you are on duty (you must select "on duty" in your closet at home to start your shift), but you cannot sleep or recover stress. After enough time has passed, you will be able to end your shift by going to the police station and selecting that option. You can, however, continue to work, but your gauges will continue to fall. To fill these, you can sleep at home or eat at any place that sells food (you pay $5 when you interact with your fridge). Stress is recovered by going out with your friends or family, and each social call costs 4h of gametime. While off duty, you have a meter that will show you how long you can stay off for, and continuing to stay off duty after your time is up will cause you to progressively lose police points (you can get fired/lose the game if it falls low enough).\n\nWhen you go for social calls, it will take you to a loading scene with a picture of whoever you decided to spend time with. A much more effective way (as of now) seems to be to buy a television in your house (use the online store on your laptop) and repeatedly watch tv. Doing so not only raises your stress, but also fills some of your energy (allowing you to skip sleeping in bed).","November 2, 2014","false","7.8"," 157 of 206 people (76%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","76","157","206","8","10"

In it's current state, it isn't worth the $20 price tag. The game lacks content and gets boring real fast. At this moment, there is only ONE developer working on this game. In the discussion threads, the developer explains that to him, this game is complete, and basically everything from now on is just icing on the cake...WOW... This game is basically an alpha...if that. I understand the whole small team, low budget thing, but to say this game is, in any way complete, is just plain crazy.\n\nPROS:\n+Can be entertaining in small bursts.\n+Sandbox\n+The game does have potential (maybe not anymore, but it did).\n+It has an aspect of realism to it.\n+The updates are free (as they should be), and the developer stated he didn't want DLCs.\n+Developers respond to you if you ask a question or comment on something.\n+Pretty cool customization of your police unit.

In this review I will assess the positives and negatives, explain some of the features and finally give my verdict on the game.\n\nPositives:\n\n- Variety of different missions (passive and direct).\n- 7 regions to explore.\n- On and Off Duty modes.\n- Level up / Ranking system in the police force.\n- Can interact with every NPC civilian.\n- Police cars have warning sirens, full sirens, and lightbars that can be customised.\n- Variety of clothing and vehicle paintjobs.\n- Realistic feel of policing.\n- Can storm buildings, make civilians surrender, stop fleeing vehicles by hitting them with yours.\n- Has an easy and hard mode.\n\nNegatives:\n\n- At the time of its release, it is quite buggy.\n- When an ambulance / police transport / tow truck is called, they are not actually seen.\n- Car physics are not very realistic.\n- You get reduced career points for actions such as breaking down doors even if there is a criminal inside.\n- You are the only patrol officer in the game.\n- Fleeing NPCs act as if they were not being chased if they get clear of you a few metres, then run again when you get close.\n- Limited things to do Off Duty.\n- Does not have a very comrehensive help / controls screen.\nPLEASE NOTE MANY OF THE ABOVE WILL MOST LIKELY BE IMPROVED / FIXED AS THE GAME DEVELOPS!\n\nSuggestions:\n\n- Could have custom loadouts (e.g. different weapons).\n- Could call backup such as a SWAT team.\n- When the player reaches a high rank, they could command other officers.\n- Needs more vehicles and Off Duty activities (could maybe respond to specific emergencies).\n\nAnalysis:\n\nI am someone who is a big fan of police simulators. Arma 3 Altis Life was great for this, and Enforcer: Police Crime Action is quite similar, only it is single player. You can drive around the town centre looking out for speeders (cars drive around 20mph and around 30mph is considered speeding) and you can pull them over, use the breathalyser or frisk them if you feel it is necessary. On the start of every shift there is a passive mission to complete by the end of the shift, for example setting up a roadblock with cones and checking 6 drivers for faults on their cars. There are also dispatch calls with generous time limits such as finding a person wanted for assaulting passers by. For this you would go and talk to the victims to get a description, then wait until there is intel about where the person was last seen. You would then go to the scene, find the person matching the description, and park up. Normally when you call out for them to stop, they will run off. You can pull out your tazer, and when you get close you fire. After that you can arrest the suspect, take them to the station or call for a transport. You get career points which help you rank up after completing every mission.\n\nOff duty mode is really unique, and has a lot of potential. When you have enough money you can buy a car, and you can also customise your home with new furniture. It is also possible to level up your stress level buy going out with friends or your mother, and other people. Instead of actually interacting with your friends or mother, the game teleports you to their house and puts the time forward a few hours, and says that you have spent time with your friends / mother, without you actually seeing anything. Physically doing activities may well be something the developers add in the future. When off duty it is also possible to fill up on food and replenish your energy by sleeping. You have to be careful though as spending too much time off duty will reduce career points.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThis game as mentioned earlier has obviously been developed on a low budget, but they have made that budget stretch as far as possible. The gameplay is enjoyable even though the graphics and physics are not fantastic. Now it has been released, it is likely that if lots of people buy it and the developers have access to more money, the game will be better optimized, feel more smooth and have some great new features added. That will of course come over time so if anything, the money you put in to buy this game will be an investment, so they can improve it. That said, even before the game is developed further it is still great fun and I can see a lot of hours of gameplay from it.\n\nOverall Verdict:\n\nI would recommend this game to any fan of police simulators, or anyone who fancies a go at being a police officer. It may at first seem very rough and strange, but believe me, you will probably get used to it just fine.\n\nI rate Enforcer: Police Crime Action 7/10 at its current state but it has the potential of being a 8/10 or even 9/10 game.","October 28, 2014","true","12.7"," 80 of 103 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","80","103","0","0"

Most of the AI is very underdeveloped: pedestrians walking everywhere, stoping for nothing and nobody. The driving in the game is a nightmare. Speed is a relative term at the moment, getting from 20mph to 134mph under a second... and good luck stoping... without immidiate reversing. Missions are quite repetative but so is the life of a police officer... as I would imagine.The time passes real quick. An hour in the game equals to a minute in our life not leaving much space to complete missons without doing 16 hours shifts. The concept of getting hungry, tired and irritated is a great idea, but at the moment they don't have much effect on our character. Ranking up is also a great idea... yet again, doesn't really change much. You are still putting those speeding cameras out, regardless your rank. But enough of the negatives.\nIt's a police simulator! Yes. You are wearing a uniform, you have your police cruiser, which is by the way very nicely detailed, as far as sound and lights go. The weapon mechanics is acceptable and it is fun giving out those tickets for broken lights or  speeding thorugh town to attend a burglary.\nThe developers have a great vision. There is no doubt about it. This game might have been released just a bit too early, but their presence in forums and announcments on up-coming updates is reassuring that buying this game at this price is an investment. Now it is up to us if we are willing to invest and see the development through. I am, because it's exciting to be part of developing a great police simulator.","December 14, 2014","true","5.2"," 51 of 65 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","51","65","0","2"

I don't think they will fix this either because it is one of the core mechanics of the game.\n\nUnfortunatly when you do anything it is done through a menu system, for example you call to get a prisoner transport and instead of seeing a car come out and pick up the prisiner you get a screeen shot saying it has been done, this is the same for ambulances, tow trucks ect.\n\nThe graphics leave a lot to be desired, most of the game looks pretty poor the models look like they came out of a ps1 game, this would not be an issue if the game mechanics were better. Also every citezen looks the same i think there are no more than say 10 character models.\n\nThe map is split into tiny sections you have to drive through checkpoints to get to different parts of the map, there are so many loading screens in this game for pretty much everything you do.\n\nAll the above points are things that are core parts of ther game and will probably never be changed/fixed at the time of writing there are many other issues too such as bugs (cars floating in the sky), I feel like the duty time is too short it makes you rush to complete the day, buying yoyur own car is far too expensive compared to how much money you make, you have to get a taxi home because home is too far from the station. Hopefully the modding community will come to the rescue of this game but at the moment i wouldn't recommend this game, ive played played games that cost £4 - £5 that have been more polished  and genrally better games.","October 26, 2014","false","3.0"," 90 of 129 people (70%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","70","90","129","2","1"

This game leaves a lot to be desired and honestly feels like an early release at best. It absolutely is NOT worth the $19.99 at this point in its production and will need many large updates to make it anywhere close to worth its asking price. I will list some pros and cons:\n\nPros:\n-It's a police simulator and those are hard to come by, if nothing else it's an attempt to deliver a very demanded but rare game format\n-It's ambitious: There are many features such as buying police cars, living life off work, etc. which are nice on first play\n-Practial button layout\n\nCons:\n-Really, really clunky - the car driving and handling may be some of the worst I've ever tried. Sure having features such as having to turn on the engine and the realistic idle movement of drive and reverse are fun in theory, but the steering controls manage to be un and/or late responsive while the gas and reverse are over-responsive. It's horrible. Running and crouching aren't much better.\n-This game doesn't look pretty. I get that it's not a large studio producing it but if you're going to charge me $20 at least have more than five car and character models in the game\n-Everyone in this game has a gun. I have done 10 missions and 9/10 ended with the suspect pulling a gun\n-Shooting controls are very poor - the gun often will not fire the first few shots unless you zoom in, which can lead to getting you killed\n-Boring mission types - There are a variety of missions and the idea of questioning suspects and searching nearby buildings is a great one, but the tips are only clothing descriptions and all the searches end in you having to gun down a pistol wielding suspect\n-Simple features such as tow trucks, ambulance calls, and police pick up lack an animation and instead take you to a brief load screen before returning you to where you were witht he action performed - things like this REALLY make it feel like an early access\n-Whoever developed it is not an English speaker and google translate is not flawless. Many spelling or wording mistakes really prevent it from having a professional, clean feal\n\nIn conclusion, don't buy this game. I was incredibly disappointed with this game. I was quite excited that a new police simulator was finally being produced as there are barely any available. Don't get me wrong, I know it is a small project and wouldn't be upset if this were an early release, but I paid a decent price for it for far from a decent product. On the very bare outside it looks similar to LCPDFR, but don't be fooled. This game is far from being worth its asking price and will need some serious updating in the control, mission, and visual department before it comes close its asking price.","November 1, 2014","false","1.1"," 34 of 46 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","34","46","0","3"

If even slowly driving your patrol vehicle onto the concrete of the downtown gas station damages your car badly (up to 10%), that's just not how it should be. Also the handling while driving is annoying. The slightest push of a button can completely turn your car around. Not to mention all the bugs like flying cars that are not reachable which makes it impossible to finish certain missions, too fast decreasing of gas and car condition, clipping errors (eg. handling your submachine gun), invisible road bumps that crash your car and so on.

The player movement is clunky, car acceleration random and almost uncontrolable, useful customization almost non existant, features that felt like dead ends and were started but never finished.

And yet it is still a much better title (and game) Then any of the "Simulation" Games released for the purpose of a quick cash grab.\nIt's simple. You play as a police officer, male or female, and are tasked with the daily routines of being said police officer. You go do a shift by beginning with a mundane mission and will either get interrupted with a more exciting mission or just simply go through the mission and gain points. Points mean you are promoted and get money, thus allowing you to spend it on your house. The closest comparision I have is True Crime: New York City in terms of random missions and being tasked with being a police officer.\nThe game doesn't look impressive, but it get's the job done. It has good character and vehicle animations that allow you to tell what a character is doing and what they plan. The appeal of just going through the daily life of a police officer is a welcome compromise between the hardcore idea of being an officer (Swat series) To the matienince of health and hunger levels (Deadly Premonition).\nThe worst part about this game is that it feels cheap. The love for this game the developers gave to it is clear, and I enjoy the experience thus far, but there are a lot of times where I find cars flipped over for no reason, the camera constantly get's stuck to one position and once someone screams you will hear that scream throughout your shift like that victim is haunting your soul. If given more assets and time, this game could honestly be as good as Euro Truck SImulator in providing for a niche audience.\n\nWOULD I RECOMMEND THIS GAME: YES\nDespite the cheap look this game has, it is a game with a lot of love and detail put into it that already feels like a unique experience.\n\nSUGGESTIONS TO DEVS: Focus more on bringing in the social life for the protagionist; I actually felt like this town could be given a lot more history and more characters that you could interact with.","October 26, 2014","true","3.2"," 27 of 41 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","27","41","0","0"

The graphics are not the best but they don't take away too much from the gameplay, plus the game came out pretty recently so I'm sure a lot of bugs will be fixed and things added. It's a pretty realistic simulator, as you get rewarded in points for giving out tickets correctly, capturing criminals, and helping out people, and you lose points for arresting innocent people, police abuse, civilian casualties, etc. And as you get points you get promoted, which earns you a larger salary each time you complete a shift, and you can buy items for your house, cars, gas, food, and ammo. You have three meters (stress, energy, and hunger) which you can replenish while off duty or on duty, but you get penalized for staying off duty too long, and you can stay on duty as long as you want as long as you have enough energy. The animations are pretty good for each action like walking, asking questions, hand cuffing, etc. and the only bad part of the animations is the idle animation for you character, as he/she just stands there lik a ragdoll and slightly breathes, and some of the animtion transitions are jumpy but still pretty good. It kinda reminds me of Watch_Dogs except you are the cops and no hacking, but is still fun. You still get some fun out of this despite some bugs and overall apearance, but again, the game is new and I'm sure will be fixed and imporved in time. If you take a look at the news feed on this game, you can see that they are frequently updating and have laid out plans for the future, and I think now might be a good time to get this game so you can get a feel for it and watch it improve, and plus you get a free soundtrack. (If you like that kind of stuff...) I guess you could mess around and just arrest everyone, but i'm not sure if you can "lose" the game yet unless you have realism mode on.

If you are a fan of LCPD:FR, you'll love this - it's more refined and less glitchy. It is not without bugs and glitches however, but once you accept that 1. It's the first day of release, 2. It's their first PC game on the market and 3. The team consists of 4 devs you really appreciate the work that has been put into it (especially if you've been following the game since it was first announced like I have).\n\nSome feedback I would like to give the devs:\n1. Currently certain areas in the roads are buggy, making your car flip at high speed, or just hit invisible objects.\n\n2. The cars could be a bit more durable - police cruisers (particularly the Crown Vic) are known for their ability to take a lot of punishment, at current time i lose about 2-4% of vehicle health by going over small bumps at the gas station.\n\n3. I'd love to hear more variety in the police radio clips, currently the clips are from the NYPD and as such reference New York locations, it'd be awesome to get voice actors in to record some radio, or at least grab a few more clips.\n\n4. Change the hunger animation, or remove it. I don't have a problem with the animation, but it'd be better if it only played once - when the hunger bar drops right down and from then on only having the text notification. I get what it's trying to achieve, and i like it: but at crucial times (foot pursuits, shootouts) it's annoying to have to stop for 3 seconds for the animation to play, leaving you very vulnerable.\n\nSome things I'd like to see added in the future:\n1. More player customisation (especially some kind of Sheriff / State Trooper uniform)\n2. More NPC variety\n3. An extra civilian car or two (perhaps a charger for about $25,000)\n4. Perhaps a police motorcyle (and proper uniform of course) for more highway patrol type players.\n\nFor anyone who has actually read this far, you should definitely get the game if you're into police sims - the devs are very open and actually listen to our feedback, so give it a play and tell them (constructively) what you think - at $14.99 until the end of October you really can't go wrong!","October 24, 2014","true","15.9"," 21 of 31 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","21","31","0","0"

Driving through intersections your car reacts like it hit something. Your cursor can randomly get stuck. The ballistics make no sense, e.g. shooting at a vehicle window and nothing is happening.\n\nGameplay is clunky, largely because of the horrible driving mechanics. Other commentors have said the driving is like Crazy Taxi; that is wholly accurate. There are some good parts of the game, but overall the game is repetitive and the flow of gameplay is hampered by the whole "stress" situation. This game would benefit a lot from a campaign, or at least set missions like in GTA. You need a car when off duty, but you only make like $500 a shift and your net income is more like $100 a shift after vehicle repairs (necessary due to aforementioned clunky driving and the fact that ramming cars is the only way to stop vehicles that do not pull over). The cheapest car is like $16,000. You can call taxis...but not to your house.\n\nSo far I've been exploiting the bugs in the game to actually get any play in. For example, I quit after going off duty and then when I log back in I'm in my house, fully rested and fed. I also call my sister, who apparently drops me back at my house after we're done hanging out.\n\nThere are so many elements of this game that just feel very amateurish and silly.

Think of True Crime New York City; you could give tickets, inspect cars, frisk people, etc. However, like True Crime NYC, this game is rather broken. The world feels empty, the NPCs are nearly identical aside from a few color differences in clothing, there is a lack of dialogue. In all aspects, the game can be done if you look past these things but it really needs a lot of work. The aimming is clunky, the driving is dodgy, the weather effects are ugly.\n\nThere is no denything that I still enjoyed the game. However, until the game is polished up, I will not be touching this game for a while. There are many ways the player can boost, or outright manipualte the way the game is meant to be played and quickly level up. Despite the bugs and exploits, you can have a fun time but the game can get really boring really fast, there's not much to do when off-duty.\n\nIn conclusion, if you can look past the bugs and exploits, you will most likely like this game if you enjoy police simulators. However, if you are like me and suffer from strong OCD, the glitches will really drive you insane. If and when this game is a little bit more playable, I will indeed consider rewriting my review.

I'm not going to review the story line, but just the gameplay itself. Enforcer: Police Crime Action centres around a single municipal police officer in a small desert town. You respond to call the dispatch informs you about and you have the options to respond to the calls or not. There is also real-time events happening in the city as well. It likes to focus mostly around the every day duties of a police officer and it does this very well. The simulator also goes beyond the duties of a police officer and you have to maintain you social and home life when you are not on duty, like manage your stress, eating, sleeping, and spending time with friends and family. Now that I have vaguely explained the game, I'm going to go into pros and cons of the game.\n\nPros:\n-The simulator/game, or whichever you prefer to call it, does an amazing job of immersing you into the life of a police officer. The lackluster graphics still do not get in the way of making you feel and believe you are the law enforcement of this town and tries to make you thorough in your investigations and arrests, making you feel like you want to make a difference in the one-cop-town.\n\n-The callouts. There is, at this stage of the game, quite a few different types of callouts that dispatch will give you while you're driving aroung town, looking for any law breakers. You can do simple things like, stopping some delinquents from vandalizing a public building to solving a kidnapping and finding the kidnapped and taking out the kidnapper and calling in an ambulance to take the kidnapped person from the situation.\n\n-The rank up system. There is a huge list of different ranks to go through, from just a simple patrol officer to the chief of police. The list is quite large and every crime you solve and even just giving an illegally parked car a ticket helps you earn points to rank up and earn new things, like different police vehicles and customization items to them, as well as making your paycheck at the end of each shift more bountyfull.\n\n-Being able to make vehicle roadblocks and checkpoints, for example, like creating a drunk driving program where you stop vehicles and perform breath tests to catch drunk drivers and even inspect vehicles to make sure they are road-worthy. Even just doing this can add enjoyment of feeling like a police officer and busting those damn drunk drivers a ticket and time in the slammer.\n\n-The game does balance the action and simulation very well. I have had to chase down many suspects that attemted to flee and deploy the tazer on them, watching them get the jitters and then give themselves up after one hell of a shocking. You are equipped with a pistol and a SMG when there are those times that you just can't take them down the nonlethal way. I found myself hiding behind my vehicle helplessly as the offender continues to sling lead my direction and found myself trying to figure out how to take him down and end the situation.\n\nI could name many more Pros to this game, but I may edit those in at a later time, but let's address the obvious Cons of this game now.\n\nCons:\n-The graphics are horrendous, but given the small team that made this whole game themselves, you find yourself not caring too much, but this is a Con because the optimization is pretty bad. For a game that lack a lot of detail in the town there shouldn't be an excuse why I only get less than 20FPS on the medium settings on my system. The optimization is really bad and I run a pretty good system, so I should get 30FPS or more on the medium setting.\n\n-Physics are non-existing. You are, what feels like, stuck to the ground, like your car is a giant magnet and stuck to the ground. There's really not much else to say about the physic-less world, but let's hope there is some sort of physic engine added in later, probably much later.\n\n-The controls, oh the controls, they are awful, with no sensitivity sliders, or custom key options. You turn your car almost 90 degrees by just barely tapping the "A" and "D" keys. It makes it hard to stay to one side of the road and you find yourself all over the damn road and crashing into everything.\n\n-Damage system. Your car takes way too much damage easily. Just by bumper tapping or hitting curb, you'll find yourself repairing you vehicle up to 3 times a shift and the shifts are very short. To get to parking lots, or the gas pump, and the garage have no slope on the curb, so you always take a lot of damage by just trying to get into the gas station. It's extremely frusterating and annoying. This huge flaw needs to be addressed immediatley. Like, now, seriously. It almost ruins the game for me.\n\n-Your food, sleep, and stress bars. They deplete waaay to fast. I think they have been fixed, but they still go down way too fast. They need to be slowed down by 10x or more.\n\nOkay, so I hope this review helped people deceide whether or not to invest in this game. Is it worth $16 on sale? Maybe, but maybe not. If they release a MAJOR and I mean, MAJOR update soon. Then hell to the freaking yes it's worth it, but as it stands no. Helping this small team of developers is worth it, though. This game has AMAZING potential and I'm so damn excited to see what they have in store for this game. Personally, I give this game a 8.5/10. I love this game. The police simulation games come in a small amount, like Police Force 2 or the LCPDFR mod for GTA IV, so I welcome this game and I am happy to support the developers. Keep it up, so far this game has me hooked and I can't wait to see what you all have in store for this.","October 27, 2014","true","46.9"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","0"

Quite frankly they are terrible with customer service, after asking a simple question one of their admins gave a short response (did not answer the question) then proceeded to lock the thread. Not the best way to handle a customer.\n\nThe game itself has its high and low points. Despite what the designers state, it does feel a little repetitive no matter how you play the game. The limited customization of characters, the fact that characters don't have traits upon creation or their experiences working make the player character feel bland. The personal interactions are also very bland and don't do much to bring the player into the world of the officer they are playing.\n\nEnforcer does provide a large playing area where you can explore, yet the world feels a bit empty. In a day and age with so much attention paid to how Police Officers perform their job, you do not get any of this in the game. You do not even have other officers, events that change how the community sees the police, or a Chief that imposes training on the force.\n\nUnfortunately, it causes the game to feel a bit hollow. While you have the option to choose from a number of police vehicles, and freedom to patrol where you want, there's just a great deal missing that causes the game to not feel satisfying.  I am recommending the game only based on the fact it's the only one of its kind and it's not terrible if you have low expectations.\n\nThe developers also should take a hard look at how they respond to customers as well.\n\nTrue Score: 5.5/10","March 23","true","6.1"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","12","17","0","10"

When it came out it had a lot of promise with a dev team that would interect with the players on the forums, addressing bugs and even trying to put in mod support. The content was growing with new vehicles, a reworked and revamped map, and albeit it isn't content, bug fixes.\n\nThen it stopped, promises of a huge patch that would add a lot more content and bug fixes was constantly pushed off. They would even start silencing the steam forum of any sort of dissent and eventually the communication stopped. After a bit of a lull they finally came up with a date to expect it. And when the time came, nothing. They addressed it again, gave it another date and once more, nothing.\n\nThis game showed a lot of promise, considering that there isn't much of a market for Law Enforcement Simulators or even games.  Heck it even had a skeptic like me thinking that they could pull it off.\n\nThe game in its current state is better then it was when launched, but still retains some of the odd bugs paired with its awkward driving controls and weird AI, you would swear you leapt from the Alpha test to the beginning stages of Beta testing. As for the customization, you can change the skin on your police car and your uniform...and that's it.\n\nAlthough, I may have been gifted this game. I feel nothing but awful for having recieved it knowing that they have willingly spent money on this with the goodness of their heart.\n\nIf you wish to pursue another Police Simulator, I would recommend that you purchase GTAV and download the LSPDFR mod. The difference is considerable. Especially due to the customization of the LSPDFR Mod that allows you to improve your Law Enforcement experience.","May 25","false","6.7"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

When the game was first released in Early Access, it looked fairly promising. It has the potential to be entertaining at first, but then just becomes tedious when you realize you keep pulling over the same 5 character models. Sometimes you get emergency calls, there are about 3 different ones and they are all exactly the same each time over. It is just a barren, empty shell of a game that has been abandoned by the developer.\n\nThe reason I say it has been abandoned is that the game literally did not change whatsoever from the first day it was released in Early Access, up until now, when it is in its "complete" form. Don't take this as a "waaaah developer ripped me off because I bought a game in Early Access" This is just my observations of the direction development took in this game, and in my opinion it was a miserable failure all things considered.\n\nThe developer, Odin Studios, has also released another Early Access zombie survival game, Better Late Than Dead (lol) on the same broken engine, so I would avoid that too! :^)","March 3","false","12.1"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

The developers were friends of mine on a forum, and I eagerly expected the release. The trailers provided a great insight into what we could be doing when the game was officially released; however, it seems the actual product wasn't really portrayed very well.\n\nEnforcer: Police Crime Action delivers a fun and different experience with its gameplay:\nYou have an off duty lifestyle, tied into the game with an actual need (Stress level). While it's not really superbly fun and you can't spend more than a few hours off duty before getting bored, it's a cool feature.\n\nBeing on duty involves multiple 'tasks' in which you do not have to finish but increase your career points, leading to promotions. These tasks can be anything from pulling over a required amount of vehicles within a certain amount of time  to call-outs, robberies and drunks being just a few.\n\nVehicle customization is a neat addition, offering four different vehicles (two are unlocked via secret codes, obtained by registering your game) all with their own liveries. Lightbars, light colours and wheel types are also some of the changeable options.\n\nTo experience the features, you really must watch a gameplay. Of course, being a police officer, a day is never the same, and you have to watch someone play it to see this.\n\nOf course, as it's only a first release, bugs are to be expected, but this game has started very poorly. Driving needs a hell of a lot of fine-tuning, it feels clunky and not at all fluid. The entire game is sort of clunky; it plays very much the indie game it is. If you're looking for an LCPD:FR contender, you're not going to find it. LCPD:FR expanded on a triple A game engine, fully developed and rounded off by Rockstar; Odin Game Studio has built this game from the ground up and it stands as a completely different game. LCPD:FR has the advantage of calling in backup, more vehicles, an urban environment, backup, etc, whereas Enforcer is somewhat primitive in this approach, featuring no backup and only a crude radio to call in prisoner transport (this is executed via a loading screen), but I feel after many updates the realism will shoot up, making the game a more immersive experience than it currently is.\n\nThe usual bugs are found, odd animations, cars flying everywhere, but these don't really affect gameplay too much (they did on the first release; gunfights were a mess!),, and provide a few laughs. It is a bit annoying, though.\n\nAs it stands, Enforcer: Police Crime Action needs a lot of work, but if we do get that, it could easily be worth its £14.99 asking price.\n","October 28, 2014","true","6.7"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

You start off as a police officer rank and work your way upto chief of police, and in the help guide in the game, it says as you progress ranks you unlock new missions and therefore take on more challenging and complex jobs. Yet this hasnt been the case, as i'm now a Lieutenant and i'm still doing the same jobs (getting the same jobs) that i've been given since the start and its now all too repetetive.\n\nSo to sum up for me...i good game, different. But longetivity doesnt seem to be there for me, as i just keep getting the same missions despite having been promoted ranks and i'm now not too far off the top rank as lieutenant. Maybe someone else will back me up on this or reassure me that new missions do come up once you progress from lieutenant.\nBit disappointing in this respect but a decent game. I'd recommend buying it when on discount.","December 27, 2014","true","11.1"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

Furthermore the missions are often rather repetative as the criminals will often spawn in the same locations every time. In addition there is literally no incentive to bring the criminals back alive (if they have their gun drawn) you recieve the same points for killing the criminal as you do for brining them back alive (unless they dont have their gun drawn, points are lost for shooting at them).  As well despite the several distinct regions in the game, they all feel almost entirely bland as they are rife with either unenterable buildings, or land with nothing on it. Another thing that I must complain about is the fact that shooting vehichles does literally NOTHING, if you shoot at a vehichle it will not do any damage to the vehichle or the driver, also problamatic is the fact that if you shoot at a civilian vehichle, no points are deducted. Another problem is that if you simply quit and reload your game, your stress level will be reset and your sleep and hunger levels are also almost enitrely reset, which removes the necessity to take anytime off. There are also rampant glitches, such as the fact that the main city (or at least the one your house is in the region of) is rife with invisible potholes on the streets that will do damage to your car if you go over them at too high a speed and possibly even send your vehichle flying. As well I have noticed sometimes that there will randomly be vehichles just sort of floating in the air. I have also noticed that sometimes in the city various vehichles will run into each other for no apparent reason, maybe it is just the drunk drivers but I dont know.\nOverall, I think that if the problems with this game are fixed it could be a good or maybe even a great game, I really do like the concept of a game where you play as a police officer as it has not been done very often, however until they fix the problems listed and the many more that I probably didnt notice or think to write about, then it is not really a worthwhile purchase\nUPDATE: they are improving the game however, so hopefully soon they will fix the bugs that currently plague the game","October 28, 2014","false","10.4"," 21 of 36 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","21","36","0","0"

It's a great concept (as mods for GTA V such as LCPD:FR have shown with their massive fanbase), and this actually isn't a bad excution of it, while it needs some serious bug-hunting and polish, the potential is certainly there.\n\nProblems:\n1.) Days are way too short, you don't have time to do much, then your character is clutching his guts in agony while standing in the road.\n2.) Time compression is extreme, gas runs out, hunger sets in, and your character becomes lethargic all while driving to work.\n3.) Physics are non-existent, one stop light in particular sends cars flipping across the road, good entertainment value, but certainly immersion breaking.\n\nThe good stuff:\n1.) I think a game like this has had a demand for some time now, while we've seen a few teasers over the years they've often turn to little more than a flash in the pan, unless you count the CoD clone SWAT games (police=FPS... wut?).\n2.) The game-play is rather straight forward, and the Sims-esque needs give you a break after putting the hurt on drunk drivers for a couple hours. I know after playing GTA V with LCPD:FR for a couple hours, I often got bored and started a massive killing spree -- no reason to do that here.\n3.) Options: car liveries, and player clothing. You have several asthetic options right off the bat, all of which seem to have had work and thought put into them.\n4.) The future -- I think this game will get the polish it needs, the devs are small enough to work with their potential fanbase, and although I haven't had look at the files yet, probably has a good modability factor.\n\nI know what you're asking and why you're reading this: "Red, should I buy this game with my hard-earned money?"\nWell, I really couldn't tell you -- while the potential is there, it isn't yet. Is it worth $20? Probably not.. not yet anyways. Do you have $20 you want to spend and help a small company along the way? Then buy it. But if you don't want to spend $20 just to see if you like it, then I wouldn't recomend it, you'd end up hating it like the rather harsh people who've commented before me because now you think you "wasted" $20 on "this".\n\nGive it a shot though, and keep an eye on it, I know I will.\n\n-RedHorizon","October 24, 2014","true","6.6"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

What I saw so far is there are not enough different cars, need more variety of people. Why aren't there a lot of gas stations, or more cars to buy? Add more cities or scenery. The lights effects are pretty cool, but you should have more patterns like a Wheelen bar or liberty one?

I bought it the day it came out, and I think it was worth the 15 dollars I spent on it, but maybe not the full price. At least not yet. The game still needs a lot of work, but I appreciate that the developers are working hard to fix all the issues with the game. I'm not sure how quickly it will be fully fixed, but when it is, this game will be really great. For example, I am still having issues with cars flying in the air, and a lot of pop in. I'll be driving down the road and sometimes objects will just appear right infront of me. This makes it almost impossible to drive through town without almost totalling my car each time. I also am still having a lot of issues with lag. If I was playing a game like Skyrim on Ultra I might question if my computer can handle it, but with this game, I'm pretty sure it still needs to be optimized for more graphical set ups. I have a quad core and radeon duel graphics, so I think I should be able to handle this just fine... Any ways, once all the issues are worked out this game could be a lot of fun.

While it has a lot of fun things to do, it currently is quite buggy, which the developers have promised to fix in patches, along with new features in the next few months. So here are the pros:\n\n- Has a fun concept; patrol the town and surrounding country looking for criminals or traffic violations.\n- Different dispatch missions; various calls like drunks causing trouble, robberies etc.\n- Multiple ways of catching criminals; tasers, guns, shout at them to surrender etc.\n- You can kick people's doors in an arrest them with a warrant (this is buggy at the moment tho)\n\nCons:\n-VERY buggy and not very user friendly at the moment (probably fixable in patches soon though)\n- There's no backup system, so ATM you're the only cop in town\n-animations, drivng physics and pursuits don't really work properly.\n-tasers make people hover in the air for a minute (???)\n\nSo overall, if you're a fan of games such as SWAT 4 and GTA 4's LCPDFR mod, i'd recommend you give it a try after a few patches. For the dev's first PC release, it's pretty decent, with a good graphics/sound options menu.\n","October 29, 2014","true","4.4"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","2"

For most of the game you will be patrolling the map in a cruiser of your choice (Squad car, unmarked, SUV) pulling over drivers, doing breathalyzer tests, setting up roadblocks and doing stop and checks, responding to violent crime calls (such as burgalarys and drug deals).\n\nThe other half of the game is when you are off duty, you will be eating food, watching TV and sleeping to get your characters needs back up so you can head back out on duty.\nThere is also some small customization as you can buy furniture for your house and switch out your characters clothing (very little clothing choice as of now.)\n\nThe game offers a "realistic" mode, which basically means your character has one life, if you create a character and get shot and killed, you won't respawn, that will be the end of that character. This mode makes you play carefully when responding to violent crimes, and is fun to see how long you can keep your character alive.\n\nThe game is definately rough around the edges with jagged animations and sometimes hilarious bugs (See flying cars and hilarious AI car accidents) the devs are doing a top notch job in taking these bugs out and are also adding new features daily, but if you can't handle these types of bugs and rough edges, I wouldn't recommend buying this game.\n\nI really do hope that the devs continue to update this game and add new features, as it has potential to be a real gem, I also hope they add paid DLC so we can continue to support it.\n\nOverall Enforcer: Police Crime Action is a solid, fun little police simulator, people who really enjoy the feel of being a LEO and upholding the law will like this game, however those of you who don't like bugs and are looking for fast paced car chases and gun fights probably won't enjoy this game.\n\nI'm personally looking forward to seeing what the devs do with this game and what kind of DLC we will get.\n\n[Edit] If you decide to buy this game you can use these two codes to unlock bonus vehicles - "greenbrute" "iamunmarked"","November 1, 2014","true","12.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/recommended/318220/","rockstarcro","RockstarCRO","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/","252 products in account","I love police games and have played many variations over the years. I was looking forward to purchasing this game and trying it out. Unfortunately, it's fallen not short, but extremely far from my expectations.\n\nThis game at best feels half done. From the graphics, the game play, and especially the driving almost nothing exactly feels right. The one thing they did try is attempting to give the player more options in how to catch those who break the law. Even this they did with a great shake.\n\nEnforcer : Police Crime Action resembles GTA in it's works. You are a police officer who can switch on and off duty by changing clothes inside your house. The house and your clothing can be customized/purchased and a car can be purchased for your own personal use. When you start out without a car, you'll be getting around by cab fare. There are three main bars you need to worry about : stress, hunger, and energy. Stress can be relieved by sleeping or hanging out with relatives, while the other two are quite obvious in how to replenish. What the game sort of did right was the simplicity in choosing what to ask a suspect. For example, imagine me standing on the side of the road and I see a car. I press C to tell the car to pull over then interact with the person inside by pressing the right mouse button. Upon pressing this, I'm given a few options to choose, from asking the person to step out of the car to using a breathalyzer. The animations are basic and none vary from person to person. Some drivers will be intoxicated or some sort of reason will pop up for you to apprehend them. Although it be it the case, I will give the game kudos for adding decoration to the command menu. When setting up a road block, you are able to walk up to your car and pull out some cones. You can also set up a radar to catch speeders but your involvement in that is literally minimal. You set up the radar and that's as far as you go. You will be waiting until you've reached the goal amount or until you get interrupted by a call on the radio. The game is sort of stale for this reason and other users have mentioned this as well. When a call does come up, a little adrenaline rush comes up and so does excitement... only for so long. Upon arriving on the scene of the crime, you will not catch the perpetrators in the act. Rather, they will be somewhere in the area and it's up to you to ask people for suspicious activity. Approach a perpetrator without a gun cocked and you may be kissing the pavement reminding yourself for the next time to run around like an idiot everywhere with his gun drawn. The game tries to act like a cop game, but I don't know of a single cop willing to run around with their gun in their hand pointing them at everyone and telling everyone hands up. This is the other thing, the objectives for the day such as issuing tickets are fun (to an extent) but when you get a call and usually the outcome involves you firing at the suspect and calling an ambulance, there isn't much to brag about. In the game SWAT 4, suspects were unsure whether they wanted to surrender or not which put the player in a real hot seat and gave them a feeling what it was like to be an officer. Here, the scenario always ends up with a call to the paramedic. It is cool that they give you all sorts of options such as being able to call for a police pickup-up of a suspect or being able to tow a car, but even then options feel quite limited. You are able to stop and frisk anyone you see in the street, but again, it's very limited in how everything goes down. People will 99% of the time shoot at you when you answer to a call on the radio. When stopping people on the street, they will give up right away. If they drop anything while they put their hands up, you are able to collect the evidence. Doing jobs properly will result in acquiring more XP and $$. I should mention that cars do get out of the way when your sirens and lights are on. As an added bonus, you can use your turn signals and even put your hazard lights on.\n\nGraphics are at best GTA 3 quality and sounds are as basic as you can get. There is no variation in sound as every bullet and siren will sound exactly the same. The game feels empty due to the lack of ambiance. Every map sections more or less resembles each other to the tee.\n\nWhat's wrong with this game? Well quite a bit. Driving first and fore most is the stiffest I've ever seen in any game. Stopping doesn't really stop you and using the hand break will not get you to where you need to go within a turn. If you forget to turn your engine off, your car may start rolling away. AI will keep walking into you and will not try to avoid you, and sometimes will continue walking into a wall. The other drivers on the road have zero intelligence. When they are told to pull over, they will crash right into you or another car. Also, when you do get run over, you don't get ran over... you get pushed by the car. Apparently it's normal for a cement truck to push a person along like it's another day in Mr. Rogers neighborhood. Not only that, the game feels extremely empty. No one interacts, no one looks around funny, no one looks suspicious, no criminal is on scene upon arriving at a forced entry crime scene even if you're right next door to the crime.\n\nI want to love this game and because I'm a hardcore police simulation fan I will play it sporadically, but as far as it goes, this game is only meant for people who have an extremely high tolerance and appreciation for this sort of genre.\n\nGiving it anything better than this would certainly be a crime.\n\nRATING : 6.0/10\n\n(This game is definitely not worth it's stated price)\n\nScreenShots :\nEvery map resembles this type of scenery\n\nA.I's do a pretty good job pretending you don't exist\n\nSet up a solid roadblock complete with radar\n\nYou won't have to call the fire department ever because nothing will ever be on fire\n\nThe collision system is extremely basic in the game. I can't even give him a ticket for hitting my car","September 7, 2015","false","2.3"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","6","9","0","0"

If you're looking for a Police simulation game then this is as close as you will get. It is no way perfect. I torrented the game first, sort of as a demo, and it has improved A LOT since. It is a lot more optimized and the graphics have been improved significantly. If you enjoy Mount N Blade and graphics don't bother you as long as the gameplay is fun then you will have no problem with this game.\n\nI will say that it REALLY needs multiplayer. It get's really lonely being the only person in the game with an IQ level above 10.","January 14, 2015","true","3.1"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","62","8","13","13","0"

Well, not good. Dont want to say it was awful.\nI have come back to it after a few months and it has radically improved.\n\nThe graphics are not gorgeous. In fact they would not look out of place in early Xbox games at points. So if you are looking for good look this is not it. And frankly, asking for good graphics in something that is a simulation game of this type is just silly.\n\nWhich brings me to my next point: I have seen some mention that the game gets pretty dull after some time playing. They are not wrong. However, once again, this IS a sim game that attempts to simulate a real life job. And much like its counterparts in the career simulation genre, things are going to get repetetive at times. Just like a real life career. Anyone who has played a truck simulator will have hit that issue where they feel bored, even if you are a trucking fan, like me. And that is to say nothing of my second favourite Farming Simulator. Sorry but real policing is not all gun fights and car chases.\n\nBugs. It has some small ones that unless you are someone who is easily annoyed or bugged (Badum Tsh!) by such things, you will not notice them.\n\nWhat you get here is something that attempts to bring you the day to day grind of a police officer. Even the boring stuff (Which i personally like to see and do) such as traffic policing.\n\nCould this be better? Sure. But what it is right now is good considering the small time it has been around.\n\nSo, dont expect high octane chases, and movie style policing. Its a simulation. And dont expect AAA graphics.\n","January 20, 2015","true","5.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The models are awful, the animations are awful, the world iteslf makes no sense (its a 20 second drive from corner to corner of the city) The mission are boring such as - Place parking tickets on cars. The game gives you guns and everything at the start so theres no sense of progression, The world is bland and clearly just thrown together without a thought at all, there are around 20 meaningless people that walk the entire earth, the cutscenes dont render correctly and when they do there a left over assets in the background, if the cars hit the player they just bounce off (due to the player weighing more, because of lazy programming) this game is FILLED to the brim with Bugs, i fell off the map twice, litterally played this for 30 mins and will never touch again.

It's been said by other reviews, but it really does feel like it's in early access and not quite finished. Apart from the floating cars, etc. mentioned by others, these are the things i found frustrating:\n- Fuel consumption. Appears to be the same regardless of engine revs... when i first started, i got into my patrol car, and played around with the keys etc for 5 mins. In that 5 mins, my fuel went down to 70%! Just idling in the driveway! Did they install a lawnmower tank in the car?\n\n- Refuelling - Apart from the lack of driveway access to the gas station which knocks 7-8% points off your damage just getting next to the fuel pump, Why do I have to pay for the gas? Maybe it's different in other parts of the world but where I come from, the police department pays for the fuel, Not the officer!\n\n- Bad Drivers! So, I'm giving a ticket to the truck parked illegally and some bozo drives into my patrol car (which had its lights going parked up on the side of the road). So I pull the driver out, Pat him down and breathalise him and he comes back clean. So I arrest him and take him to the station and apparently i've arrested an innocent man! I guess its not against the law in mountain valley to not look where you're driving. I imagine the same thing would have happened had I arrested the 2 people in cars outside the police station who were sat stationary on the footpath driving into the concrete planter boxes... Innocent too I imagine..\n\nIts an awesome concept. and has the posibility of being one of the greats.. but it needs work. I would not recommend it right now.. its a disappointment. If the developers actively listen to the reviews and make some changes that make the game a little more realistic (it is after all touted as a SIMULATOR not an arcade game) then I'd be happy to re-review.. but if like me, you ignore the reviews and buy it anyway, be prepared for a let down.","October 30, 2014","false","8.1"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","63","5","8","2","0"

This game needs a lot of polish before it can even be considered playable for the mac.

I have no idea what's wrong but obviously the game is not as optimized as it should be.\n\nMissions get very repetitive after a while and there are no helpful instructions whatsoever as to what you need to actually do to complete missions or even find your way back to your own home. If you're the type of gamer that likes police simulators then by all means go ahead and buy it. It'll just be a while before this game develops to the playable state you were expecting in the first place.","January 22, 2015","false","14.0"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","6","10","2","0"

Any defense of traditional Europe/traditional values is branded by the forum moderators as xenophobic and autobanned.  Any profit they make off of you would probably end up promoting communism on some level, promoting destruction of European culture, identity, and economy.  If you're one of the people who has had enough of the BS with the elites selling out the traditional Western countries to create the nightmare they call the "global village" (translated- make everyone in the west poorer, make it impossible to start business, freeze up the economy with regulations, etc..), then don't support these guys.  If you think Europe should NOT be invaded by parasite vermin from around the world who are doing nothing but mooching off the welfare state, you are not welcome on their forum.  They do a great job destroying themselves.  What's even more ridiculous, is that I was DEFENDING the developers in the forum, telling complainers and perennial whiners to shut up, because they only paid 20 bucks and to stop thinking it's going to give them their dream come true.  Developers will even ban the people who defend their work if you go against their weird political agenda of inclusion of terrorists and unchecked invaders in Europe.","February 24","false","2.3"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

Its a good game as its something that hasnt been done before, there isnt an open world cop game like this. It does need a few changes and fixes (PLZ ADD MODS! / STEAM WORKSHOP!) but after all that i say its worth it, perhaps not £11.99 but worth it gameplay wise, i can only recomend this to the guy who wants something new and is tired of GTA 5 and has had enough of the same, but if you are the guy that is stuck with COD forever and is level 945 on GTA 5 then this most likely isnt for you as you are just the kind of person who gets what is fed to you and is happy with it (nothing wrong with that i enjoy playing COD and GTA sometimes too) but i say that we should cut the game some slack and let it evolve a bit, let it grow and see where its going.

You're in control of policeman, starting your career from the very bottom of it, showing us with lots of details how does the average life of law-enforcement officers looks like.\n\nAdvantages\nGood, quite uniqe concept of game\nAbsorbing gameplay with tons of various missions and events\nSounds are done quite well and voicing of characters is predominantly very good, big "+" for it\nControl over your characters, whether on foot or by car, is bit weird yet very responsive\nMap is impressive thanks to its size and diversity\nDisadvantages\nMechanics and physics of game are horribly... stiff I would say. There is almost no smoothness anywhere you look around\nGraphics are kinda not satisfying as for 2014 release\nAfter few in-game days, it forces you to be always on duty as things that are out there to do are really limitet\nBuggy and glitchy as all hell\nSummary\nGame is obviously highly unpolished but devs are constantly coming out with new updates to it, fixing quite alot of issues  (when I watched footage from about 1 year ago, game was in really, really worse state), but still, in my opinion it should be in Early Access right now. Yet after all, game is interesting, I might even say that it's bit addictive once you'll get sucked into it, I would love to see even more refined version of it. Even with all this negativity towards game and developpers, I do recommend trying it out. It's interesting and entertaining and belive me, thanks to "unfinished" state of game, it's even more fun than you would think it is!\n\nPersonal score\n6.5 / 10\nIf you find my review helpful or funny be sure to follow Opium Pulses curator page right here for more reviewed games!","March 9","true","5.8"," 11 of 20 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","11","20","0","0"

Whilst going through this page and looking at reviews, I figured I should try it. It was on sale and I said to myself "Why not?" I personally am a very very very large fan of the police genre of gaming (My favorite games being the SWAT Series, especially SWAT 4, LCPDFR from GTA 4 and various other examples) and while I am very biased in my opinion, which is why it is my opinion, I feel compelled to say that I can see the arguments on both sides. Yes, this game is buggy in various ways (Though not as many as I read about. Maybe I was lucky.) And yes it does have questionable graphics. But this game, to me at least, was not made for the general population. It was made for the people who specifically like to play regular cops and aren't all about the shooting and explosions life styles (I realize the hypocritial way I said SWAT 4 was my favorite police genre game, back off xD). This game has an outstanding amount of minute details. So while I do recommend this game, I recommend it to a very small percent of gamers. If you want a game that's about shooting and explosions then this is not for you. Whilst I love explosions and shooting myself, it's a nice change of pace. And yes, the devs do update this game (As shown by the police motorcycle) but at the same time it is a small dev team so you have to accept some problems. All in all I feel this game was made for me and some other small percentage of gamers. If you are truly stuck on if you should buy this or not, I recommend watching gaming reviews and not someone whose messing with the engine of the game and make up your mind for yourself.","January 20, 2015","true","10.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The amount of people out there looking for a genuine (and playable) police simulator is a high number; this game is for every one of them. It is definetly a working progress, and the developers need to fix a lot of things and add more into this simulator:\n\n- AI must be fixed... when someone decides to run away from you, your thoughts are "yes, finally a chase" and then they end up running into a wall or car and don't proceed. This ruined a fair few moments for me.\n-More (and fixed) car chases. Car persuits are a big pro to police games, and this game just needs to up that. When a car fails to stop in this game, it drives far too slow, you want a car persuit to be fast and action filled, not at 25mph on a more or less straight road.\n- Fixed sirens. The siren/ lights (on police vehicles) in this game is better than most others. Having said that, there could be A LOT more done to make this system more lifelike.\n- Animations. The game is seriously lacking in animations when something happens in-game e.g. after you shoot and kill a suspect, or find any injured person, the protocol is to phone for an ambulance. Once pressing the ambulance button the cop states into the radio that an ambulance is needed. Then a still frame of the police station shows on screen along with the allocated points for what you have done. That is just one example of many animatons that are lacking.\n- Fellow cops. For a POLICE simulator, there isn't enough police-you are litterally the only cop in the game. It would be nice to see other patrol cars patrolling and to be able to call for backup when you are under fire from multiple people.\n- Different scenarios (and locations). After a while playing the game, the patterns are obvious, you do not even need to look at the map to find out where you're going because you already know where the developers have set that specific scenaro to happen.\n\nTo conclude, this game is very addicting, you can play for hours on end without getting bored. BUT, having said that, this game is 100% a WORKING DEVELOPMENT, only purchase this game if you are prepared to put up with some annoying bugs and repeated scenarios. This game definetly has potential. Lets just hope that the devs see what needs to be improved and act accordingly.","January 9, 2015","true","21.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is a fun game but has a great deal of flaws:\n\n1: Graphics obviously aren't the best\n2: Vehical Handleing isn't the easiet to get a hang of\n3: And there is some weird thing glitches, like once I got a report of a murder suspect so I got a warrent and went to there hosue, I walked in they pulled a gun so I shot them, but the game took 1500 points from me! Also when you pull drivers over and inspect their car it sometimes says "Illegal Licences Plate" Normally you get arrested for that and in this you can only ticket the criminal.\n4. I activated the HOHOHO cheat which added a christmas theme and IT WON"T GO AWAY!!!\n\nOther then a couple flaws it is an enjoyable game to play if you can deal with the bugs, I hope you the makers see this and hear other player's cries for help and they fix these flaws, it would make the game 10x better!","February 4, 2015","true","7.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game has a very realistic feel to it, and has many different features that you can do; For example you can walk up to an civilian NPC and ask them if they have seen someone with a warrant, if they seem drunk you can ask them to take a breathealyzer. You can also check the NPCs for drugs and weapons along with many other things. Somtimes you're hiding near a highway with radars ready to catch speeders. Sometimes im patroling watching for gang/drug activity. The only downside to this game is that the graphics are terrible, they're similiar to the ps2's graphics and have similar graphics to GTA: San Andreas, but I hardly even notice the bad graphics and they're easily overlooked. This game is especially impressive considering only FOUR men came together to make this game.

In the trailers it seems as if there are cool crimes to arrest people for such as robbery, murder, or kidnapping. While ther are these crimes that occur they RARELY happen. In the mean time there is really not much to do but the boring repetative stop and frisk, or pull over a breathalize. The controls for this game are a whole other problem. The car is near impossible to steer which wouldn't be a problem if you didn't have to pay your money that you made in the game to repair it.

There is sooo much you can do, while capturing the day-to-day grind.  While this could become boring, it does a pretty good job capturing the realistic career-risk of any "routine", where even a routine traffic stop can turn suddenly violent and the player faces sudden and possible death.\n\nIt is not perfect.  There areas I wish would be improved upon.  My primary issue is, there is no, "backup" support.  You do not have a partner, and you can't call for backup.  I feel this, could be rectified in an expansion, which, maybe we will see some day.  This shortcoming, I was able to justify with the rationale, that, the town is pretty small, it "might" be possible, that you are the sole law enforcer on payroll (and of course dispatch).\n\nEnjoyable game, does a great job of immersing the player in the atmosphere.  Visuals are well done in many areas.  The open-world, random citizen/criminal generation keeps the replayability going (and humorous at times... my first day on patrol, my first three suspects were woman truck drivers... immagine my shock when this cute girl in a sexy dress jumped out of her truck and pulled a gun on me...).\n\nThe realistic mode really draws you in to the life & death risks of the job... you learn to rapidly eject from your car in a chase, taking up cover behind your car, very quick.  My player has died in the line of duty four times (meaning permadeath-restart from scratch), before my latest actually has survived up to LT (and still going).\n\nThere is a more arcade mode... haven't played it, where death is not possible, but injury is.  This brings me to the 2nd issue I have with the game, I believe their should be a second mode, where both injury or death is possible (not always one or the other).\n\nGreat game.  Hope to see more from the developer.\n\nDefinitely recommend this game.\n\n10-4!","February 12, 2015","true","14.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

It needs alot of patches and bug fixes an example is when a car hits you, what happens is that the car makes a flip. Another one is when I travel from one part of MV to another one, my car loses 1 hp. When my sirens and lights are on some cars still manage to hit me and the drivers are not drunk.. Things are very expensive. I was on a mission I had to shoot 2 drug dealers, I got hit once and and shot like 8 bullets. My car got hit by another car and i had to pay for the gas. I had to pay 100$ for the bullets, 200$ for medicine 25$ for my car and 11$ for the gas plus the food that is 5$... I earned 600$. My total expenses were 341$ 600$-341$= 259$. The cheapest car costs 9000$... After my shift I have to either walk home (like 7-10 minutes running) or waste 20$ on a cab to my house. You have to pay to get food out of your fridge, it's 5 dollars... wtf? The physics in this game suck, driving is laggy even with the lowest graphic settings with me and I have no clue why because I can run games like arma and BF4 on max FPS. 2 body shots with an m9 can drop me but with my mp5 I need 4 body shots (m9 fires 9×19mm Parabellum bullets and so does the mp5, this means that it fires the same bullets but I need more shots to drop someone). The map is split in small parts which is really annoying because I get lost alot (for anyone of you who has postal 2, think about going from one part to another) This wastes alot of time on just loading that and I get lost sometimes trying to find my house.. Also when I arrest someone and as for a van to pick them up I see a screen saying "Good job, one less criminal on the streets"... They could've added a truck to pick them up.\nMy advice to you: Don't buy this game unless you are willing to deal with the bugs.\nThis game has potential, if you fix these bugs it will be an amazing game.\nThanks for reading this.","March 6, 2015","false","5.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I would grab this on sale at probably half off if you are looking for a police simulator because it is worth it if you can look past it's issues. But I don't think it is worth the full price. Mainly due to the bugs.\n\nYou will have some days on Duty where tons of action occurs. As soon as your day starts you get to a simple task like perform traffic stops, or road blocks and check drivers for vehicle problems, such as invalid license plates and drunken drivers. Or simple tasks such as ticketing illegally parked vehicles.\n\nOther days you will get calls about robberies, injured people, people assisting in homicides. The game does have a customization menu for your vehicle and you can buy new weapons as well which is a nice feature however it is rather limited. You also do get promotions and paid more money with those promotions to buy new cars, customize them and also decorate your home.\n\nYou have 3 meters on your screen you need to keep track of.\n\n-Energy (You need sleep)\n-Hunger\n-Stress (You reduce this by watching TV, showering, or hanging with family or friends on your time off)\n\nThe games major downfalls come in its outdated graphics as well as bugs. The AI can be very buggy at times and all over the place, also some of the options do not work so well. Such as obtaining a search warrant, I cannot seem to get this to work for the life of me.\n\nAll in all a great game, but it feels unfinished, it plays like it's early access and I wish there was a wider variety of jobs to perform besides ticketing, injured people, drunken drivers and fleeing criminals. I would love for the developers to bring new content to this game and address the issues with the bugs.\n\nAll in all I like the game game but I would NOT pick this up at full price. Wait for it to go on a major sale. STEP UP TO THE PLATE DEVS! Please fix this game.","January 23, 2015","true","15.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","3"

It needs alot of patches and bug fixes an example is when a car hits you, what happens is that the car makes a flip. Another one is when I travel from one part of MV to another one, my car loses 1 hp. When my sirens and lights are on some cars still manage to hit me and the drivers are not drunk.. Things are very expensive. I was on a mission I had to shoot 2 drug dealers, I got hit once and and shot like 8 bullets. My car got hit by another car and i had to pay for the gas. I had to pay 100$ for the bullets, 200$ for medicine 25$ for my car and 11$ for the gas plus the food that is 5$... I earned 600$. My total expenses were 341$ 600$-341$= 259$. The cheapest car costs 9000$... After my shift I have to either walk home (like 7-10 minutes running) or waste 20$ on a cab to my house. You have to pay to get food out of your fridge, it's 5 dollars... wtf? The physics in this game suck, driving is laggy even with the lowest graphic settings with me and I have no clue why because I can run games like arma and BF4 on max FPS. 2 body shots with an m9 can drop me but with my mp5 I need 4 body shots (m9 fires 9×19mm Parabellum bullets and so does the mp5, this means that it fires the same bullets but I need more shots to drop someone). The map is split in small parts which is really annoying because I get lost alot (for anyone of you who has postal 2, think about going from one part to another) This wastes alot of time on just loading that and I get lost sometimes trying to find my house.. Also when I arrest someone and as for a van to pick them up I see a screen saying "Good job, one less criminal on the streets"... They could've added a truck to pick them up.\nMy advice to you: Don't buy this game unless you are willing to deal with the bugs.\nThis game has potential, if you fix these bugs it will be an amazing game.\nThanks for reading this.","March 6, 2015","false","5.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/partymaster/recommended/318220/","partymaster","Partymaster","http://steamcommunity.com/id/partymaster/","237 products in account","If your looking for a good police simulator then look no further. This game(as it is still in development) provides almost all the policing experiences a cop could experience in his every day life. However there can definitely be some improvements to the game as far as exanding the map to be more of an open world sandbox and have additional CPU police to patrol around as well and maybe even multiplayer. This game has a huge amount of potential to be the best police simulator out there but it still needs quite a bit of work to get there with minor bugs and a little bit more of a relistic feel. What I mean by realistic feel is when you play the game everyone and everything gameplay mechanics wise seems to be robotic almost, the civilians almost seem like they have no life to them at all, they look like robots walking around and the driving is a little unrealistic in the sense that if a car runs into you, it doesn't harm you but it harms itself by somehow flipping over and going out of control. Like I said though, this game is a great simulator because of the wide variety of missions and calls that a normal cop would answer to in real life. The basic concept of the game is fantastic, its working out great as far as how policing is done so far. If your like early development games and policing then I highly recommend this game, however if you like a full complete game and not something in development then I suggest waiting a little longer before purchasing the game however the price of the game may increase like almost all games that are in development always do.\n\nMy suggestions to you devs as far as making the game that much better is\n1-Multiplayer. Co-op multiplayer and maybe even VS Drug Lords VS Cops/Swat\n\n2-Implement more AI- patrolling around and busting bad guys and all is really fun but the lack of other police patrolling around and no backup seems a little unrealistic and a little dull, having a team to work with or maybe even command when your a high ranking officer can definitely spice up the gameplay and make it a lot more interesting.\n\n3- Implement S.W.A.T- Everyone loves swat...No question about it. Swat is a huge help during tight situations and if there was even an option to play as swat and just go on raid missions, breaching and clearing, taking out High Value Targets and etc. that would probably spike this games badassery up by a ton. Everyone loves that feeling of being a badass S.W.A.T with a team about to breach and clear or just go into an area to raise absolute hell. Implementing S.W.A.T AI backup in the game and even a S.W.A.T mode would just be awesome\n\n4- Connect the maps together to make one big sandbox- Instead of seperate maps, connect them! I think most people would prefer a sandbox rather than different sections, especially if the different sections of the maps can be really small in comparison to the main city.\n\n5- Implement more traffic violations- I've noticed that every time I pull over a car for blowing a red light or even crashing into another car yields no bad outcome whenever they are pulled over and traffic stopped. I always mistake pulling people over for blowing through red lights and think I'm going to ticket them but the game doesn't pay attention to them blowing red lights, implementing that would be pretty cool too.\n\nFor all of those people reading this review all the way through good job! lol and thanks for reading. As for the Devs, nobodys expecting all these suggestions to happen in like one week, we can wait however don't blow the suggestions off otherwise the game will get dull very quickly because there is a lot more that you guys can add to increase the feel of being on the Police Force. Don't quit! This game has potential over all other police simulators to be the best because so far you can do a lot more in this game as far as policing than any other game made so far. You guys are doing a splendid job and I wish you the best of luck developing this game, I can't wait for the final product because if you guys can make it this good this early in development, you guys can definitely make it amazing with time. Don't quit! A lot of people will support this game to the end!","November 9, 2014","true","6.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wartornsoldier/recommended/318220/","wartornsoldier","Maverick","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wartornsoldier/","86 products in account","Alright. Never written a review before so. What the hell! Ahem...\n\nI'm going to give this a 3/5 in this case. Mainly because its in its baby stages, and theres more to add in this case.\n\nSo far, the gameplay is alright, Simple so far. Start out as a beat cop (Sort of) Walking around, Ticketing vehicles, setting speed traps, pulling over drunk drivers. There is a minor story in both the male and female characters, but that quickly liquidates as..Well. Its a sandbox..Free-roam. So I can't mark down points on that.\n\nThe location is....Clunky. In my personal opinion (And others may feel free to disagree) It feels as if you could either move it to a more populated area. (Or create a second map. That would give players a much wider sense of adventure and exploration) Or just expand the area more with more to explore. Eitherway, Once you've seen all the areas, thats it, exploration over.\n\nCombat? Well. Rarely there. Or I havn't really progressed far yet. (First Sergeant so far) Fists are rarely used (You could throw a baton in there for variation.) Firearms are suddenly thrown in. Maybe remove the SMG? I find its rarely used around now. Probably for later ranks. Tazers are not the only non-lethals out there, Pepper spray maybe? Good for short-ranged. Less range than the tazer. More range that your fists (Or baton if its implimented). Two hits and your dead, unstandable. Frustrating when you forget the tazer has only one shot and you have to reload. Maybe throw in body armor later on? Seeing as you will more and likely going up against drug dealers, cartels, gangs. It'd be logical to later on recieve body armor for a small cost. Hey. If it gets worse, throw in S.W.A.T armor/uniform! Baby stages!\n\n\nMissions. So far. So good! It started slow with simple hunt down drink drivers, or wander drunks, or setting up speed traps. And as I ranked up I started getting more into the dirty side of crime by hunting down the occassional drug dealer. Like I said, in baby stages so far, but more can be added. So looking forward to more here. Some missions I find quite entertaining. 'Go to X and find Z' One I just find inasne......'Illegally parked Vehicles' Okay. So 25 Minutes to find 7 wrongfully parked vehicles. I don't think Mountain Valley has a drug problem, I think it more has a parking problem. And they're so well hidden that I can't find them! I have to traverse map to map sections just to meet my quota! Oh. And some times are too generous. 25 Real time minutes is pretty much 2 shifts. But when your first shift ends, that progress is lost. Be alittle more less lenient on times..... And...Less illegally parked cars...More drugs and gang violance.\n\nProgression. So far, I'm liking the rank tree and the standard 'Gain certain amount of EXP/Score' to rank up. Maybe unlock more uniforms/Vehicles/Housing and such as you level up. Hell. If you get to Sergeant, throw in an NPC Companion maybe! It pays to be ranked! And this job is too dangerous to go alone!\n\nDriving. Okay. So far. This will be the main negative part for this. I took a car out, and I swear I was falling into a 'Back to the Future' Moment. Gently press the accelerate button...And...Atleast a second later. 99MPH..... I had to immediantly slam on the breaks to slow down. Heck. At one point I was going in reverse so fast I had to slam the handbreak on as accelerating did nothing! This requires quite abit of tweaking! And the car repair costs are manic, not just because its expensive, its more that its difficult to NOT hit anything. Cruise helps. But. Eh.\n\nA.I. Uh. Its not great, but its not so bad either. Maybe some more character models for look. They're not so bad walking, they just horrific when driving. Stop one car, the one behind slams into it and slowly (And painfully) Tries to continue moving. Usually people stop as soon as they hit a car, (Or see a policeman giving a ticket to the person in front.) A bit of an intelligence tweak may be required on the drivers.\n\nCustomisation? Meh. Five off duty uniforms. Two on duty uniforms. Not great. Maybe add shopping here? Or a new flashy uniform when you rank up? Only one house. Little customisation. An expensive fridge does little to no better than your cheap stock one.\n\nOverall Verdict? So far. So good. Alot of tweaks to be made. It does in its own way feel unique. Realistic. And none of that 'Good cop, Bad Cop' rubbish. (Though kicking in doors is quite a good one without caring for minor loss points.)\n\nImprovements?\n- A much stronger progression system. Maybe additional uniforms per promotion. Access to more equipment.\n- The cars. The speed is an issue. If I go any faster, I might break the time barrier and see the game in the future.\n- A.I. Yeah. Intelligence Tweak when driving.\n- Either friendly Police A.I to assist you (Seriously, Can't be the only policeman in this valley right?) Or impliment a co-op feature (Though give that time, Co-Op and multiplayer is when the game is a good few builds away from completion)\n\nOverall. Keep it up. And keep going!\n\n","March 27, 2015","true","5.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Here are the bugs- 1. Includes floating cars, primarily in the downtown area, even after the updates, cars still float. 2. Some cars do not pull over by siren, when i'm trying to pull certain vehicles over, they fail to pull over, when i go in front of them they just drive into my car. 3. I found that my left indicator keeps coming on while driving. 4. When I press the number "4" in-game my character is frozen and it can't move. Very big issue. Now enough with the bugs, here are a few suggestions- 1. More police vehicles, assuming the map takes place in America, I, living in the United States assume you don't know much about our vehicles. My city has these cars (Fayetteville Police Department) -2007 Ford F-150 -2012 Dodge Charger SRT8 -2007 Chevrolet Tahoe -2012 Dodge Caravan -2005 Chevrolet Impala -unmarked 2012 Dodge Charger -Unmarked 2010 Chevrolet Impala Of course, since you don't have licensing you can't get the exact models, but its just a idea on what our police cars look like. 2. Police backup I think that calling backup that come in there cars, armed to help you out would be great. I think that would have to be my biggest concern with the game is the lack of other police. 3. Less loading screens It would be nice if when you called a ambulance, a ambulance was actually responding and you can see the ambulance doing its duties, same with calling a police van to pick up someone you arrested, as well as when you call a tow truck, just to add to the realism, i saw you did alot on off-duty, but don't forget about on-duty! 4. Mod compatibility, I think it would be nice for members to be able to create mods that maybe you developers never really thought of. 5. Less rain- I'm not sure if it rains alot in Brazil, but here in North America, it doesn't rain every single day. 6. More call outs- Here are just a few ideas that I think are very important to implant- -Car Accidents (VERY IMPORTANT) -Drunk Driver -Officer Assistance -Domestic Disturbance (2 people fighting, even when you get on scene) Those are pretty much the most important call outs I think the game needs. 7. Faster cars I found the cars go only about 17 mph through the city while the speed limit is 30, I never actually caught someone speeding. I think people speeding should be very visible. 8. Speed Radar I think it would be nice to see the exact speed of vehicles passing by 9. License check It would be nice to check people's license by going back to the police vehicle and checking there name on the police computer. There, we can see if the driver has a warrant/expired license/revoked license. It would also be nice if some drivers didn't have a license as well. 10. Police baton Not very important, though just a small feature. Overall, its a great game.","November 3, 2014","true","177.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I see what the devs are trying to achieve, but it looks like they have given up on their game and have moved on. I feel like I have been robbed of $20 because this game is not even worth that much, I would estimate that this game is about $1 at this stage. Another reason I feel robbed is that they actually think that this game is done and have slowed down on making updates which is what makes me furious. This game is not even half done, its 1/10 done.

The ability to have a partner call for backup, ems, fire etc, and actually see it in action is the main feature missing in this game. Even in the most rural of areas there are at least a handful of officers. Even if backup would take a while it would arrive. Other than that I see great potential with this game.\n\nOverall as of now "IF" you would like to play a game where you are a police officer that makes a good attempt to do more than just high speed chases and shootouts, and adds the day to day aspects of the job than purchase this game "WHEN" it is on sale. As of "NOW" $20 is not worth what the game currently has to offer.\n\nIf in the "FUTURE" this game had a: dynamic, immersive environment, similar to that of GTA, the addition of a functioning police department under a broader Emergency System that encompases patrol, detectives, and swat, as well as other units,  a ranking system that allotted you actual command appropriate to the rank i.e. commanding multiple units, support, operations, etc. As well as expansion on the ability to buy/customize your house, buy different cars and have a sort of off the job "sims" like experience. Now that game I would pay $60 for.","December 16, 2014","true","4.3"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Being a police officer and being able to do whatever a police officer does on a daily basics makes the game great. Not to mention the ranking system which gives the game a more MMO feel, where you need to get enough points to rank up to the next level.\n\nThe bad: Sadly, there is more bad then good. Pretty much the only major bugs/glitches that the game has is with vehicles. Just driving a car feels really bad, in the sense that simply moving forward and turning left for just a second makes the car almost instantly turn 90 degrees. Also sometimes when driving fast and colliding with sidewalks or passing intersections makes the car fly into the air, and do a couple of flips.\n\nAnother glitch is tha sometimes when firing at an armed criminal, your bullets dont shoot correctly. And by that I mean dont shoot at all, leaving you free to get shot by the armed criminal.\n\nI am still recommending this game because as a police fan, this is perfect for me. Adding on that there is no other stable game that accomplishes this.","October 25, 2014","true","3.6"," 10 of 19 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","10","19","0","0"

So far, in its early stages, it's proven to be a very fun game. I played it for about 2 hours and got to level 4. I was a little disappointed that I couldn't figure out how exactly I can get my new car.\n\nNow, in the start, you have to spend the first 5 minutes just reading through a very long text that explains how everything works. Instead, I'd suggest a categorized way of looking through things. That way it's better to look over things later on as well.\n\nThe game mechanics are.. they're not the best. It's sluggish, the car handling is pretty crap and civilians driving trucks often cause traffic jams because they can't turn a tight corner. As far as civilian interaction goes and completing missions that involve finding suspects, it's pretty much impossible. I mean my first callout was a vandalism case. I asked the guy who called what the vandals look like and he gave me the descriptions of them. Problem was, the descriptions matched like 3 nearby NPCs. I'd have no way of knowing which one of them is the real criminal. Some diversity in appearances would be nice. Just retexture the clothes, if you must.\n\nDUIs are a little confusing. So I check someones breath and they're under the influence. I get them out, place them under arrest and it gets ticked under "Innocent Civilians Arrested"? DUI is an arrestable crime in pretty much every state in America. Wut.\n\nAs far as on-duty off-duty time goes, I think there's way too much effort put into the off-duty aspect. The stress level is.. meh. Hanging out with your mother/sister/grandparents/friends doesn't even give you any stress points, which is weird. And what's with the applause as if I've just won an Oscar after hanging out with people?\n\nThe police vehicle itself is well done, as well as the interactables. Indicators, siren and the strobes themselves. However, it being just red is kind of bland. Red and blue in the future pls. Oh and while I think to mention it, please add a tutorial on how to get a new police vehicle, because I have not got a clue on how to get my new ones.\n\nThe game is built on a strange engine as well. I mean the graphics aren't really top of the line and I'm lagging horribly unless I run it under low graphics. It doesn't make much sense that I can run Payday 2 better than I can run this.\n\nThere should also be a little bit of further research be done on the ranks. I mean you don't have Police Officer and then Senior Deputy. Deputy = Sheriff's Office/Department (county).

The calls are varied and the situations feel organic with the suspects reacting in a believable manner. For example, drunks and thieves are unlikely to pull a gun on you (but much more likely to flee) while hardcore criminals with drug raps and worse tend to violently object to your stopping their crime sprees. Also, the locations of the criminals are not automatic and sometimes you just have to go around looking for them either from witness descriptions or behaviour described in the initial call (example: rowdy drunk). The game does give you hints after a time in the form of radio updates about the rough location of the suspect(s), if you are worried about never finding the perps.\nThe police procedures are sometimes a bit off (you generally want to cuff the perps before searching them, devs...) but overall the basics are there. Note that this game is meant for people who WANT to follow police procedure. If you want to mess around, the game basically ignores it and it will feel weird. But then again, if you just want to mess around in an open world, why are you here? GTA series are that way --->\nThe game has problems too. The driving model is wonky and there are some glitches and bugs around, some amusing (like trucks launching in to orbit) and some not (a car parked 10m in the air....).Its not the prettiest game in any way, shape or form either.\n\nIn the end of the day, this is a game for cop fans and no-one else. Being one, i recommend it.

I dont know whether I'm playing in first person or third, I think this is casuing the shooting to feel awkward as well.

The developers have allot of work to do with this game as it is unfinished. The game is easy and hard at the same time. I got up to 2000 career score than in one mission dropped to -200 and had died. The reason i was chasing a burglar suspect who was running had my taser out trying to stop him and npcs started running scared i assume. The suspect turned on me with a gun since you can't key bind i brought up my radio instead of my gun had to cancel that screen got my gun out than had to aim. Once aimed i tried shooting but a npc run in front of the suspect and i killed the Innocent person who in real life wouldn't running towards someone with a guy aimed at a cop. Than i tried shooting the suspect but it was too late he killed me. And since there is no save function i lose all my current score and went into the minus.\n\nBut i like the idea of the game it offers a good experience as what it would be like to be a police officer. Its well done for what there is and i know they are still working on it since its a early release game. The price is right and i happy with what i got for what i paid for.

Those not recommending the game in their reviews clearly aren't looking at the big picture, and don't understand how gaming (or Economics for that matter) works.\n\nFirst off, I'd like to remind everyone that the original GTA is a piece of ♥♥♥♥. The original 3D sandbox GTA, GTA III is a piece of ♥♥♥♥. But we would have never gotten to the glory that is Grand Theft Auto 5 if people just simply looked at the graphics and didn't support it. This game has alot of promise, and I'm willing to bet tha with the right ammount of support, the developers can turn this into a franchise game easily as it's not your run of the mill shooter. It's a mix of Shooter, Simulation, Roleplay, and Strategy. And you have to balance all three to be successful, thats what makes a good game, variety and uniqueness, not graphics. If you think otherwise, then you're not a real gamer.\n\nI'd recommend you just get it now if you're on the fence, 14.99 is alot better to spend than 19.99, and the price on the Excaliber site is nearly $25, so you're gonna have to make a choice.

Right now for me I turned my Resolution down to far and it wont let me change it back up to 1080p because the 'Save' button is off the screen and there is no Scroll bar. I played a good bit and its mostly the same thing over so it does get boring fast. I already went into the files and (kinda changed it up to $75k | aswell might have change my rank up to 10... cough) well lets not talk about it. Although I looked at all the customization on cars and your person and house. It was not very much and theres should DEFINITELY be MORE. They should go into greater detail on the little things, and make it customizable like the belts and shoes, etc. Not make it where it changes the whole suit, or skin. Make it color customizable, and a cool addon would be multiplayer. It would be very cool to play as a police officer or a crime lord. A good game to look at is Arma 3, the popular addon for it 'Altis Life' is pretty nice without downloading anything. And then a full out addon 'Arma 3 Life' is a better thing to look at. The realistic aspect of it is very nice and would be cool if you could mirror a little bit of that. I do understand that your a 4 man team, or so i've heard. So this may take a while but would definitely bring in a lot more sells. I bought this the day after it came out, not even knowing it just came out, so I was a little bit like wtf? But I do understand on what its like to model all this stuff. Definitely think about it, may'be a year or so. If you don't do that kind of stuff I definitely would lower the price, because at the moment it really isn't worth $20, even for me I bought on sale for $15 and probably shouldn't be that much. Thanks for reading this, if you do developers and hopefully that will encourage you to create and give you some ideas for the upocming updates, and possibly addons. :)\n","October 27, 2014","true","5.0"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

So far, in its early stages, it's proven to be a very fun game. I played it for about 2 hours and got to level 4. I was a little disappointed that I couldn't figure out how exactly I can get my new car.\n\nNow, in the start, you have to spend the first 5 minutes just reading through a very long text that explains how everything works. Instead, I'd suggest a categorized way of looking through things. That way it's better to look over things later on as well.\n\nThe game mechanics are.. they're not the best. It's sluggish, the car handling is pretty crap and civilians driving trucks often cause traffic jams because they can't turn a tight corner. As far as civilian interaction goes and completing missions that involve finding suspects, it's pretty much impossible. I mean my first callout was a vandalism case. I asked the guy who called what the vandals look like and he gave me the descriptions of them. Problem was, the descriptions matched like 3 nearby NPCs. I'd have no way of knowing which one of them is the real criminal. Some diversity in appearances would be nice. Just retexture the clothes, if you must.\n\nDUIs are a little confusing. So I check someones breath and they're under the influence. I get them out, place them under arrest and it gets ticked under "Innocent Civilians Arrested"? DUI is an arrestable crime in pretty much every state in America. Wut.\n\nAs far as on-duty off-duty time goes, I think there's way too much effort put into the off-duty aspect. The stress level is.. meh. Hanging out with your mother/sister/grandparents/friends doesn't even give you any stress points, which is weird. And what's with the applause as if I've just won an Oscar after hanging out with people?\n\nThe police vehicle itself is well done, as well as the interactables. Indicators, siren and the strobes themselves. However, it being just red is kind of bland. Red and blue in the future pls. Oh and while I think to mention it, please add a tutorial on how to get a new police vehicle, because I have not got a clue on how to get my new ones.\n\nThe game is built on a strange engine as well. I mean the graphics aren't really top of the line and I'm lagging horribly unless I run it under low graphics. It doesn't make much sense that I can run Payday 2 better than I can run this.\n\nThere should also be a little bit of further research be done on the ranks. I mean you don't have Police Officer and then Senior Deputy. Deputy = Sheriff's Office/Department (county). Police Officer = Police Department (city).\n\nAll in all, like I said, it's a pretty good game with a lot of potential. Needs a lot of polishing. I mean the English itself in the game is sometimes bizarre.","October 25, 2014","true","3.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheSanzi/recommended/318220/","TheSanzi","Sanzi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheSanzi/","116 products in account","The reason I'm saying no because as of my review date (10-25-14) the game still has many bugs. The drving mechanics are very wonky. The game mechanics just are kind of angering, the sleep, stress, hunger, gas, and car health meters go down way too fast. And because the most per shift I've even gotten so far is $300 and taking into consideration $50 for gas and $300 for repairs, you begin to lose money or make very little profit. And the game in general lags horribley.\nOn the positive side, I do see a chance for this game if they work the driving mechanics out and I'll look into about changing the depletion speeds. Also I would like to see a longer allowed time to be off duty, and if your cop car either had to stay at your house when not being used or at the police station when not being used. Instead of this thing where you park at the police station, go off duty, take a cab home, go to bed, wake up, go on duty, and boom your car is magically in your driveway. Just make it go one way or the other.\nAnyways I'm sure I'm missing out more major bugs, but anywyas I would not recommend buying this game until they fix quite a few things. And like I said, it has a chance, hopefully.","October 25, 2014","false","2.6"," 10 of 20 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","10","20","0","0"

Just about yesterday did I really give this title a chance. Now I am addicted to it. For some odd reason. Allow me to give some Positives and Negatives on the game. So you can decide to make your purchase.\n\nPositives: -Plenty of Dispatch Missions to take advantage of, which are Challengings and Fun.\n-Your Police Vehicle has many customization options.\n-Wide vast area with much to explore.\n-Plenty of criminals to arrest.\n-Responsive Controls.\n-Driving feels very fluent, but takes time to get used to.\n-Music is actually very good.\n-Voice acting is on point.\n-There is always something to do, even when there are no missions available.\n-Ranking up feels rewarding as you get an increase in pay.\n-Weather & Night to Day transitions are wonderfully done.\n-You are able to decorate and buy new things for your home.\n\nNegatives: -Aiming can be a chore to pull off, when you are about to get shot.\n-Sometimes when doing routine checks on cars, the person driving the car will run sometimes, also very far.\n-When you arrest someone, you are forced to walk. When you want to put them in your car, especially if they run a far distance, walking takes forever to get back to your car which will inspire you to call police dispatch to lighten the burden.\n-When finished with routine missions, entering the police station for a warrant based on a mission is a problem. When you step back outside the station, the game forces another routine mission on you, removing the perp from the map. Making it difficult to find where they are again. Unless Dispatch decides to update you on their location, which can take a terribly long time.\n-illegally parked cars don't spawn often, unless you quit, and restart the game. So when asked to ticket illegally parked cars, there are usually none in the street. There is a way around this by ticketing cars on the street by checking their license plates, and ticketing them that way. Its the only way around it.\n-You take no damage by getting hit by cars. They usually flip over you. Also you cannot kill a pedestrian by hitting them.\n-You can only arrest one person at a time. When you're after two perps, you have to dispatch the one first, while the other has the chance to escape as you cannot go after them when you have someone handcuffed.\n-Sometimes Dispatch missions never show up. Because of a game glitch. You have to sleep 8 hours & restart the game. The glitch is caused by the Stress meter being too low. The game gets confused and doesn't turn back Dispatch calls on.\n-AI pedestrians have a habit of endlessly walking into vehicles, perps in houses run endlessly into the wall, or the door with their body peeking out of the door when you try to arrest them.\n-The game has a bad habit of throwing you missions even after your shift is over. They should stop. Because when you end your shift with a mission active, even if its routine, you are penalized points. Which you need to rank up.\n\nEven with the negatives I think the game is still very enjoyable. Regardless, its up to the buyer. Happy New Year everyone.","December 30, 2015","true","13.9"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","50","5","10","3","4"

Do they understand the concept of Quality Assurance?\n5 Febuary. Latest update FINALLY released. WTF, more bugs than ever, more unplayable. What the hell are the devs doing?\n27 January. Latest excuse is that players want free update?? Since when has it been normal to charge for bug fixes?\n10 January 2016, still no update or comms from the dev. Only sign that there not dead is the censorship in the forums they are carrying out..\n19 December, no update, and devs actively censoring the forums to remove any 'negative' threads and comments, while not actually giving any response.\n\nUnfinished and full of bugs. Devs talk a lot about the 'update coming', but was due June 15, still no show near end of October 15. Many threads locked down and being directed to their list of excuses as to why they can't finish/ can only have 1 person part time working on it (Looks like they believe their next game is more important than actually finishing this one). And finally, if you want to try and see any progress they claim, you have to have a Facebook account (for a game thats sold on STEAM)?\n\nBelow a small list of some of the bugs/poor gameplay i have experianced:\ni. Unable to execute handbrake turn(car slides sideways and backwards at about 40 degrees).\nii. 70 mph max on road and offroad, road and terrian has no effect.\niii. Suspects running up a cliffside half inside the sheer face.\niv. Any vehicle impact(such as stopping drunk driver), by rear ramming, results in your car being bounced high onto the air, as the car stops dead on the road(the physics suck).\nv. Chasing a vehicle off map ,new map has car sitting on side of road, engine off and suspect vehicle disappered.\nvi. A suspect pulls a gun on you, but if you shoot them before they open fire, you get a hefty penalty, for opening fire on an innocent. Then when you call for the medical services, you get a bonous for completing the mission and removing another criminal from the streets.","October 27, 2015","false","6.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

Go figured they wanted to hide the negative review.  I was one of the first people to play this game, and I spent several months not only playing it, but being the sole community moderator.  Enforcer is an arcade-style game.  I honestly wouldn't even call it a simulator.  Yes, you play as a cop, you can pull people over, respond to calls, etc but the game is just terrible.  The graphics are bad, movement is bad, driving is bad, general physics is bad.  Essentially, EVERYTHING about this game is bad.\n\nFor the first few hours you can enjoy it, but after that you realize how annoying the game actually is.  The AI is a joke!  The AI drivers are terrible, which reflects back on the developer for not making a decent AI.  Here's one example:  I pull over someone for running a red light and give them a ticket.  As soon as they leave the traffic stop, they do it again!  There was even one intersection where cars would always despawn coming from a certain direction.\n\nThe worst part about this game is the developer and thee publisher.  Kaligus and Chris.  They try so hard to justify their inability to properly fix this game and make it worth $20.  Excuse after excuse.  "Updates are coming." Yet, here we are, one year later and only 3-4 updates have even been released.  Both of these people are purely incompetent.  When I was a moderator, I was the sole community-to staff interaction.  They essentially made me the public relations guy because they are TERRIBLE at talking to their community.  Since I stepped down, their communications with the communtiy has decreased to almost none!  When Chris does post, all he does is post linking to a topic that talks about an update.  Nothing else.\n\nCustomization wise, you can change your lightbar to one of three options, but one of the lightbars has been broken since day one.\n\nYou can choose from various different cars; from a Crown Vic to a Charger, to a Tahoe to an F150 to even a bike,\n\nYou can use custom textures on vehicles that were created by the community.\n\nFinally, here's some basics.\n\nPositives:\nVery basic police sim.\nOption to use various cars.\nAbility to be good cop/bad cop.\n\nNegatives:\nVery little to no real interaction from the developer and publisher.  Community is often left in the dark.\nGame hasn't changed since day 1.\nBasic issues such as lightbar texture problem is still not fixed.\nDriving is very poor and arcadey, not simulation like.\nEver since a recent update, the game has gotten much worse.\nPublisher often tries to downplay all negativity, which includes deleting negative posts.\nRips off customers by making this very basic and very horrible game $20.","February 16","false","376.9"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","1"

Just about yesterday did I really give this title a chance. Now I am addicted to it. For some odd reason. Allow me to give some Positives and Negatives on the game. So you can decide to make your purchase.\n\nPositives: -Plenty of Dispatch Missions to take advantage of, which are Challengings and Fun.\n-Your Police Vehicle has many customization options.\n-Wide vast area with much to explore.\n-Plenty of criminals to arrest.\n-Responsive Controls.\n-Driving feels very fluent, but takes time to get used to.\n-Music is actually very good.\n-Voice acting is on point.\n-There is always something to do, even when there are no missions available.\n-Ranking up feels rewarding as you get an increase in pay.\n-Weather & Night to Day transitions are wonderfully done.\n-You are able to decorate and buy new things for your home.\n\nNegatives: -Aiming can be a chore to pull off, when you are about to get shot.\n-Sometimes when doing routine checks on cars, the person driving the car will run sometimes, also very far.\n-When you arrest someone, you are forced to walk. When you want to put them in your car, especially if they run a far distance, walking takes forever to get back to your car which will inspire you to call police dispatch to lighten the burden.\n-When finished with routine missions, entering the police station for a warrant based on a mission is a problem. When you step back outside the station, the game forces another routine mission on you, removing the perp from the map. Making it difficult to find where they are again. Unless Dispatch decides to update you on their location, which can take a terribly long time.\n-illegally parked cars don't spawn often, unless you quit, and restart the game. So when asked to ticket illegally parked cars, there are usually none in the street. There is a way around this by ticketing cars on the street by checking their license plates, and ticketing them that way. Its the only way around it.\n-You take no damage by getting hit by cars. They usually flip over you. Also you cannot kill a pedestrian by hitting them.\n-You can only arrest one person at a time. When you're after two perps, you have to dispatch the one first, while the other has the chance to escape as you cannot go after them when you have someone handcuffed.\n-Sometimes Dispatch missions never show up. Because of a game glitch. You have to sleep 8 hours & restart the game. The glitch is caused by the Stress meter being too low. The game gets confused and doesn't turn back Dispatch calls on.\n-AI pedestrians have a habit of endlessly walking into vehicles, perps in houses run endlessly into the wall, or the door with their body peeking out of the door when you try to arrest them.\n-The game has a bad habit of throwing you missions even after your shift is over. They should stop. Because when you end your shift with a mission active, even if its routine, you are penalized points. Which you need to rank up.\n\nEven with the negatives I think the game is still very enjoyable. Regardless, its up to the buyer. Happy New Year everyone.","December 30, 2015","true","13.9"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","50","5","10","3","4"

This game will never be fixed, as they are playing everyone daft enough to buy it as mugs.\n\n12 Febuary, update a disaster, so bad, they rolled back to previous build. Do they understand the concept of Quality Assurance?\n5 Febuary. Latest update FINALLY released. WTF, more bugs than ever, more unplayable. What the hell are the devs doing?\n27 January. Latest excuse is that players want free update?? Since when has it been normal to charge for bug fixes?\n10 January 2016, still no update or comms from the dev. Only sign that there not dead is the censorship in the forums they are carrying out..\n19 December, no update, and devs actively censoring the forums to remove any 'negative' threads and comments, while not actually giving any response.\n\nUnfinished and full of bugs. Devs talk a lot about the 'update coming', but was due June 15, still no show near end of October 15. Many threads locked down and being directed to their list of excuses as to why they can't finish/ can only have 1 person part time working on it (Looks like they believe their next game is more important than actually finishing this one). And finally, if you want to try and see any progress they claim, you have to have a Facebook account (for a game thats sold on STEAM)?\n\nBelow a small list of some of the bugs/poor gameplay i have experianced:\ni. Unable to execute handbrake turn(car slides sideways and backwards at about 40 degrees).\nii. 70 mph max on road and offroad, road and terrian has no effect.\niii. Suspects running up a cliffside half inside the sheer face.\niv. Any vehicle impact(such as stopping drunk driver), by rear ramming, results in your car being bounced high onto the air, as the car stops dead on the road(the physics suck).\nv. Chasing a vehicle off map ,new map has car sitting on side of road, engine off and suspect vehicle disappered.\nvi. A suspect pulls a gun on you, but if you shoot them before they open fire, you get a hefty penalty, for opening fire on an innocent. Then when you call for the medical services, you get a bonous for completing the mission and removing another criminal from the streets.","October 27, 2015","false","6.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

There are differnt location to work at, missions or "call outs" can be cancled if your busy with something else. There are good guides to fallow through. The game can be fun, lot of possabilites. How ever there is a dark side to this.....\n\nThis game was released as a finshed product with more bugs than Orkin could handle. The bigger bugs that made gameplay impossable have been resolved, but the game still has a load of bugs... Instant spawns and disappearance, bad graphics, malfunctions, unknown sliding, bad car handling and menu freezes and more... After a while this all gets old to deal with, I even placed up a "bug report" video on youtube with the bugs, and bugs that Odin themseves denied exsisted. It took 9 video's in a bug report play list to show what exsisted, including what Oldin denied. At this time a update or fix has been promised for soon release, but that was months ago before summer of 2015. At this point and time the entire community including a modirator, is at war against Oldin without mercy. I belive I am the last one to turn, and for the longest time did support the game against the community including the modirator. Now I am with them against the game. Odin has brought up they were still working on the update, but have one guy, and crying about lost money as if it was our fault for releasing a unfinshed product calling it compleate. Maybe we at the community mis-understood that a game that has been released, is a finished product by Odin Logic, even if it dosen't work right or at all.  Because this update fix? lets face it, it is just a re-build of the game...\n\nI will mention it..  ---->looky here, some kind of Police sim Called Enforcer..\n\nI will advise it, ----> Since there are many that got refunds, get it on sale at its cheapest. Because once you get going, you will feel less ripped off at the sale price. Right now as it stands at $19.00 is a rip off, It is only worth $5.00 and that is just being nice.. So if your still want it, it is best to wait for the price to come down a lot. Who knows when the new build is done.

Keep In-mind this review has been written on my beliefs In which I have seen an experienced, we all experience things In different ways. I am writting this review to show people my experience on this game.\n\n\nReview                        Gameplay        The overall gameplay for Enforcer: Police Crime Action, Is basically grand theft auto with less features In a nut shell . The gameplay Is kinda hard to play, with It's slow moving ability an the slight less appealable grahpics. (Which I will speak about In the graphics section). This game has a lot of policing features more then most Police Role-play games , but overall some of the features are quite buggy an not to real-life standards. This game had so much potentianl In certain areas but now just lacks the motivation of the development team to place the certain items In to that game. I rate the gameplay for Enforcer: Police Crime Action a 3/10.                 Graphics        Enforcer: Police Crime Actions graphic portion of the game lacks In some what of a way. It feels like the game was just based of a pre-made system such as unity. In most games being released there Is a Increased In graphical enchancement. I was terribly upset with the graphic portion of this game, In lacked certain graphics but I can't expect much In a game that wasn't properly prepared. I would rate the graphics for Enforcer: Police Crime Action 2/10.                 Developers        I haven't spent to much time In looking Into the development team, but I can say this the team Is small and not that much time seems to be put Into this project. I state this because most games they have the deverlopers always reaching out the public of gamers looking to hear what they want In a game. I have followed the forums for a bit to see if any of that Is happening an I haven't seen much of It. I feel that If that this team was larger and had more love an motivation towards this game an It's future I could see a better future for this game an it's community. I would rate the Developers portion 5/10\nI believe this game should have went In alpha before becoming a full released game, It was all rushed an didn't recieve the proper attention It needed from the developers of the game.\n\nEnforcer: Police Crime Action Rating - 4.5/10	I did enjoy playing this game an have made several videos of It, In which I will have attached below.\n\n(several videos I have made)\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMwd2v-G0LM\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoowAeKJMA\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoFwEaFsl2g","October 25, 2015","true","7.6"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","46","6","13","2","1"

I like a bit of realism, and being able to pull over, check, breathalyze, arrest and transport is lot's of fun. The constantly running perps who take you miles from your vehicle, the tedium of keeping your stress level down, and the annoyance of having to play hours before you can drive around off duty are pretty big detractors. Having said that it appears the developers are working very hard to get this right (eventually) and that speaks volumes for the games appeal. Is it LCPD:FR? Nope, but it is trying, and with the addition of backup units, even a cutscene style state police call where they come and "help" by arresting the fleeing vehicle, (I'm tired of spending tons of money fixing a cop car that has to be used as a battering ram every time I get in a chase) would make this game absolutley worth it. For now 6/10 with the potential for 9/10. Go ahead and buy it, play it a little and wait for those awesome updates I'm expecting soon.","November 3, 2014","true","29.1"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

I say this because rarely does a game make me lose all track of time. I grew up with the Police Quest series and until recently, I've played the Police Force series from Excalibur Publishing  (makers of Simulator games). About a year ago, the maker of Police Quest, Jim Walls, was trying to revive the Police Quest series and bring it into the 21st Century but sadly it left Kickstarter and ceased.\n\nIf you've played Police Force, there are some things alike. You can walk around, accept emergencies, and use the number keys for "actions," Enforcer definately uses Police Force as a foundation but expands on it greatly and whoever put it all together definately should get a raise!\n\nI have to say that the devloper and his team really did a great job. You are able to have a home and when your shift is over, you can spend time there eating, watching TV, showering, sleeping, and/or taking a nap. Any of these things can help your stress, hunger, and alertness. All of these can have an affect on your aiming in sticky situations as well as your life ( you can die if you don't eat). You can explore any of the 7 regions but your patrol area is within Mountain View. You can buy furnishings for your home and at a higher rank, you can upgrade your patrol car as well as buy a car while off duty. Your home is kind of bland. I wish that my house looked a little nicer than the shack it resembles. I do find it odd that when I'm off duty, my patrol car seems to be parked at my house. I though I would have to drive (walk, or take a cab) to the Police Station, and get to my patrol car. When I go to the Police Station it's void of any NPCs. Your main reason inside the Police Station is too check email, ask for a warrant, or go off duty. When you have suspects in custody, all you do is click the police station door (without going in) and a window pops up asking if you want to put the suspects in jail. Clicking the window, tells you how you did (giving expierence). You also get expierence putting tickets on illegally parked cars and towing them away when a driver fails a breathalyzer test.\n\nWhile on duty, dispatch will squawk emergencies and you have the option of excepting. If you do, dispatch alerts other officers that "26" (your call) is in route. It would of been nice like in Police Quest, to be able to click a button to alert dispatch og your whereabouts (ex. "dispatch, 26, is heading south on main or dispatch, 26, is on scene or requesting backup. I found that when a suspect raises their gun, you don't have much time to react which in real life is true but there should be something that allows you to walk up to the suspect and if he/she pulls out a gun, how can you survive.  I have to say that the game makes you learn. If a murder suspect or drug dealer is your emergency, you bring your car close enough, and if things get hairy; jump in your car for a better strategic location. I did find that outside, the perp runs and you can command them to stop. The one in the mini-mart only allows me to take him down. I wish there was an other way instead of killing the suspect. By the way, the mini mart only had a counter.\n\nYour patrol car is fantastic. I love how you can get in, turn on your lights, (high beams also),  turn in the warning siren ti pull people over, turn on the emergency lights for persuit, and siren. You can set up speed traps and road blocks to check traffic. The help screen is a nice touch. I wish that there was a quick tutorial that goes thru it by putting you in each situation.\n\nI love how this game is open ended on the realistic side. It won't end unless you retire. You can rise through the ranks from patrolman to trooper captain ( I think, I would habe to look). Rising through the ranks seems to allow you to be able to buy a car, upgrade your patrol car and/or buy another. That seems it.\n\nI wish we were able to see other cops, mingle with them as well as call for backup. In Police Quest, you would be at the Police Station, shower, change into your uniform, go through a briefing with the captain, grab your walkie and patrol keys. I see the speed limit signs which is realistic, however, when I was not called to an emergency, I find that me speeding, had no effect as well as running red lights. I thought when you don't respond to emergencies, as a police officer, you still must obey all traffic laws.\n\nAll in all, for $19 (from the release date till Oct. 31st, it's $15) this game is really good. Yes it has bugs (cars parked 5 ft. in the air), poor path finding by NPCs but the game has already been thru 2 patches so it will be interesting how this game evolves. I'm hoping it's constantly supported with added DLC and expansions. This game has the potential to be fantastic. Now while this game has some bugs, it certainly doesn't make this game unplayable. It's still very enjoyable!\n\nInterstingly, a patch came thru during the weekend. Cudoes to the developer for working "after hours." Don't think it's not appreciated!\n\n","October 26, 2014","true","18.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

However, it does have flaws that need to be adressed.\n1: Vehicle handling is awful. Doesn't even make sense at times.\n2: Running criminals will stop and walk normally like nothing ever happened after 30 yards, instead of continuing to run or trying to hide.\n3: Criminals with guns with will sometimes wait up to 8 seconds to start shooting you.\n4: There are not enough things to spend your money on. You only get to buy 3 cars, and buying furniture for your house is nice, but not enough. It would be nice to be able to buy a new house, and place it wherever we want.\n5: You can not recruit a partner, which is very unrealistic.\n6: Gun play is not very good, considering there is no recoil at all. It would be nice if there was, and as we gain stress levels, the recoil becomes greater.\n7: Criminal AI is awful, they stand in one spot when trying to shoot you, instead of trying to get behind cover.\n8: We need more content, after you play the game for about 3 days, you have pretty much seen everything there is to the game. Give us more missions, more cars, more houses, more gun options, gun customization, a recoil system, partners, trucks, ect.\n9: It would be nice to have an actual Story Mode. This would entice us to keep playing and staying interested in the game. It mentions that your grandparents dont have much time to live, maybe you could play on that a little bit?\n10: MULTIPLAYER! The fun of this game would increse tenfold if we could play with a friend.\n\nI'll say this again, I love this game and want to see it grow. However it is very unpolished and until the problems listed above are adressed, I couldn't reccomend this game to just anyone. But if you could look past the problems, you just may find your new favorite game.","April 7, 2015","true","38.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I am currently playing on Normal difficulty so that there is no permadeath and all you ever do is find cars that are parked illegally or check for drunk drivers. I don't want to do any of that stuff for an extended period of time. I want actual calls to respond to. It's not fun doing the same crap every single shift. If you're *lucky*, you may get one call per shift (like every 20 minutes).\n\nI absolutely love police and firefighting games, but I cannot recommend this game in its current state. In order for me to recommend this game, the following needs to be done:\n\n1. Better AI: criminals tend to give up immediately upon pressing "C".\n\n2. Smoother transitions with weapons and aiming: I've died multiple times because the aim system is very odd. Also, you should be able to pull the trigger whether you're aiming or not. In real life situations, you aren't always going to be able to aim at your target if he/she is at point-blank range.\n\n3. More frequent missions: I really can't express this enough. I don't want to spend my entire shift switching from giving parking tickets to taking people to jail for a DUI. That's not fun. I want to finish up with one call and immediately have to go to another call to take care of them.\n\n4. Limiting players to one call on Normal mode is bad: The fact that I don't want to die permanently has no bearing on my ability to multi-task. I really don't know why they thought it was a good idea to only allow you one mission at a time in Normal mode. In an Easy mode, perhaps.","December 30, 2014","false","21.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I think that if you want to make this realistic then you should have the option to change gears and when you slow down to stop at a light that the vehicle would stay stopped until you hit the reverse control again.

In addition if you have played LCPDFR you know the struggle to get the mods you want to work, hell you had problems getting GTA IV to start, but you did what you had to, stayed up through the night to get everything working because you know how fun it is, and now you are looking at this game because its like LCPDFR except you don't have to worry about bugs, crashes, bad mods, no. Finally a game based around the idea of police simulation. Now the question is, is this game good? Is it what we all wanted? The answer, is yes. Amazingly this seems to be the first success of its kind and on my very first day of playing it I already had 5 hours, keep in mind this was not made by Rockstar, this was made by an indie developer so this is not GTA 6 Police, not even close. This game still has minor bugs, it still needs polishing, it is not finished. Currently the game is very enjoyable and playable, none of the minor drawbacks that I just mentioned damper the games "fun factor" at all. All I meant by saying that is do not expect GTA 6 Police, however what you will find is a game with good graphics, decent animations, a good selection of vehicles, and a good system of fighting crime. And I know that the one question you still want answered before you buy this game, so I will tell you, yes, you can\n*Pull people over (Traffic stop). When you do this you have the option to check their plates and license, use a breathelizer, ask them to exit the vehicle, issue a ticket, and I believe a couple more. And yes, sometimes they do run and you must chase after them, but whatever the random situation is you have the choice of letting them go free, write a ticket, or if need be, arrest them and transport them to the station or call a police van. You also should tow their car however that is optional. Now for your characters abilites, you can fight with your fists, you have a pistol, you can direct traffic, you have a taser, and you have your radio to call a police transportation van, an ambulance, a tow truck, and help if your police car runs out of gas or has reached its maximum damage capacity. (Yes cars use gas I know its awesome!) And of course you do get random callouts. There is also a level system, I do not know off hand how many levels their are but I believe their is about 15 or 16. You start as a corpral and make your way all the way down to the final rank Chief of Police. Now depending on your rank you will get more dangerous callouts and get paid more at the end of your shift. Now I do not want to spoil the whole game but you do have shifts and off your shift you go to your house, you can go out with friends, own your own civilian car, eat, watch TV, shower, sleep, and many other things. Now this system of off duty is not the greatest, their is not much to do and it will probably be polished in the future. But I do think that it is good because in a game that is centered around police simulation it would be awkward to be on patrol 24 hours a day 7 days a week, so I do believe this is a good system that was put into play. So that is pretty much what you are getting, also do not forget the whole game is open world, no missions! Now if there was one thing that I could say was the biggest problem with the game currently it would probably the car physics, they are not unplayable but they are not Iracing physics. That is pretty much the end of my review and don't think you know everything now because I am happy to say there are many more features in the game still that you can do as a police officer! I do believe it is worth the money and my final rating on the game *CURRENTLY is a 8.7/10","April 6, 2015","true","5.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

And I know that the one question you still want answered before you buy this game, so I will tell you, yes, you can\n*Pull people over (Traffic stop). When you do this you have the option to check their plates and license, use a breathelizer, ask them to exit the vehicle, issue a ticket, and I believe a couple more. And yes, sometimes they do run and you must chase after them, but whatever the random situation is you have the choice of letting them go free, write a ticket, or if need be, arrest them and transport them to the station or call a police van. You also should tow their car however that is optional. Now for your characters abilites, you can fight with your fists, you have a pistol, you can direct traffic, you have a taser, and you have your radio to call a police transportation van, an ambulance, a tow truck, and help if your police car runs out of gas or has reached its maximum damage capacity. (Yes cars use gas I know its awesome!) And of course you do get random callouts. There is also a level system, I do not know off hand how many levels their are but I believe their is about 15 or 16. You start as a corpral and make your way all the way down to the final rank Chief of Police. Now depending on your rank you will get more dangerous callouts and get paid more at the end of your shift. Now I do not want to spoil the whole game but you do have shifts and off your shift you go to your house, you can go out with friends, own your own civilian car, eat, watch TV, shower, sleep, and many other things. Now this system of off duty is not the greatest, their is not much to do and it will probably be polished in the future. But I do think that it is good because in a game that is centered around police simulation it would be awkward to be on patrol 24 hours a day 7 days a week, so I do believe this is a good system that was put into play. So that is pretty much what you are getting, also do not forget the whole game is open world, no missions! Now if there was one thing that I could say was the biggest problem with the game currently it would probably the car physics, they are not unplayable but they are not Iracing physics. That is pretty much the end of my review and don't think you know everything now because I am happy to say there are many more features in the game still that you can do as a police officer! I do believe it is worth the money and my final rating on the game *CURRENTLY is a 8.7/10","April 6, 2015","true","5.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Sure, its graphics can be considered lacking, maybe around a more ps2 style, but that just means older pcs are welcome to join in on the fun. Driving is touchy, especially in the different models, but there are more than enough good moments in this game to keep a player coming back. The pedestrians are quirky, so it may seem lame to some, but I think it breaks up the repetitiveness of the game. Different things to do, such as setting up road blocks or speed radars, busting drug dealers who seem to always have a gun, serving warrants and more. This game isnt difficult to learn, and is a great time killer. I got on Steam sale for 9.99, and I would say that is the price YOU should shoot for.\nPros\n-Variety of missions leading to different styles of gameplay.  (Laid back pulling speeders over, or gun ho, busting dealers)\n-Customizable clothes, cars, and house.  (Not a huge variety, but enough to set you a part)\n-Easy to learn\n-Tons of potential\n-Taser the ♥♥♥♥ out of someone.\n\nCons\n-Outdated Graphics (Older systems welcome)\n-Touchy driving system\n-Lack of interaction with HQ, other officers, and other agencies.\n-Turning on/off car over and over\n-Turning on/off all your lights and your siren.\n-Gas and damage system are “iffy”\n\n7/10\nWould smoke a bowl waiting for speeders just to have the perp run on me so I can shoot them in the back with 10,000 volts.\n","March 29, 2015","true","8.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The concept is solid, but the programmers really needed to test it on more systems.\n\n4 gb of ram for this game is a steep requirement?! I can run the Sims 3 with most of the addon content all day long without crashes!\n\nI meet all the requirements yet when i try to leave my house dressed as a cop the game crashes every time. I can seem to leave the house as the off duty version of my protagonist, but as the cop it's a no go. I have a suspicion that the way the programmers have the game handling the memory allocation has something to do with this issue. I think the game is trying to load everything in one big data dump on the computer eating all the memory all at once.\n\nI also found that it crashed out upon trying to re-enter my house as the off duty version of my character, again sounds like poor memory handling coding.\n\nInterestingly enough i tried running the game in 256 color mode and it runs, except the game is unplayable because it looks like you have the predator's eyes...\n\nAt least it wasn't very expensive, but i really wish the developers would have told everyone that they needed 8 gb of ram instead of 4 to run a flash game...","October 30, 2014","false","1.1"," 1 of 7 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","1","7","0","0"

Some really good ideas and has been well excuted for a game still in early development.\n\nHere are some things I'd like to see implemented in the game.\n\n-Have more variety of missions as you move up the ranks. As I've ranked up I am still getting the same menial tasks while on duty. I'd love to be able to do drug raids and busts as well look for clues at a murder scene etc.\n\n-Have the option to choose a career track. Have the ability to choose whether to become a SWAT team member or Homicide Detective etc.\n\n-Have more things to interact with and do while off duty. Have a bar or nightclub where the player can go for a drink to lower stress or even meet a partner to date and eventually move into your home.\n\n-Have bigger houses to buy\n\n-Have food places modelled indoors. This could work gameplay wise with robberies in progress happening inside the places or hostage negotiation situations.\n\n-Fledge out the precinct indoors a bit more. As you rank up you get your own desk. You could also have a meeting room where the chief tells you about a wanted criminal to track down etc.\n\n-More NPC variety. Once you pull them over and as you walk up to their car they could take off and start a pursuit. I also haven't encountered any of them who try to punch you, it's either they run away or draw a gun. There should be an inbetween.\n\n-Add new items like pepper spray or baton you can use on unruly NPC's and Spike Strips for speeding cars who are dangerous.\n\nThe game is still in early development and I am sure the developers have a lot of plans for the game they want to implement. I am keen to see how this game pans out in the future :)","January 19, 2015","true","3.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Has its glitches here and there but nothing game breaking, just minor things that occure not too often. Has lower gaphics but that doesn't take from the game itself. Controls took a little getting used to but after about 15 minutes you pretty much get the hang of it.\n\nI hope the developers will continue to add to this game, it has a lot of potential. Would love to see more regions perhaps as ways to pick where you want to work, like a bustling city instead of just the rural area, perhaps some more buildings to go into, even while on duty like stores, restaurants, ect. Kinda like how real officers do, who eat while on duty or patrol stores. More interaction with NPCs while off duty would be nice, such as building relationships or stopping in at a friends house and actually going to clubs or restaurants. Hopefully they are working on these or will consider it now it's been said.\n\nBut over all I give this game a 9/10 and a recommend.","January 19, 2015","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Looking for realism? Don't buy. Looking for something like <Insert random word> Simulator 2014? Could give you some fun.\n\nGot off the bus near my house in the middle of the night, it's raining and I've just got a shirt and hotpants on, should've planned that better. Got a squad car in my rather crappy yard, suppose it's my colleagues wanting to greet me. Turns out it isn't, it's my own personal squad car with a never ceasing stream of chatter through the comm radio. Nevermind, I better go to bed instead. I enter my house and I feel the sudden urge to charge through the living room at full speed, I must've looked like a malformed gorilla with my freakishly large arms waving about. Oh well, at least no one saw me, I'll go to sleep now, wake up fresh for my shift tomorrow.\n\nI decide to take a cab to the station, seeing as I can't use the squad car in my yard. They all look funny at me when I arrive, I'm apparently not supposed to check in here at my shift, they tell me to just get changed back home and drive out, they'll assign me as I go. But they graciously enough let me check my e-mail on the computer and offer to sell me ammunition for 100 bucks. Seems kind of strange to me, at my previous assignment they equipped us with that kind of stuff for free. Oh well, note to self: Don't shoot too much.\n\nOnce again I call the cab to drive me home. I check my wardrobe and there it is! My uniform, a handgun, a sub-machine gun and a tazer. Ready for all eventualities. I go out and enter my car, start it up and tries to back out the entrance to my rather crappy yard. This car handles like a rhino, at least when backing. But at least it accelerates quickly, I went from 0-110km/h in like 2 seconds. No one really cares when I speed past red lights on the sidewalk in 110. The perks of being a cop.\n\nFirst mission! Catch four speeders with the radar. Well that's ironic. Anyway, I drive out a bit away from town. If I should really call it town, more like a glorified block. I set up near a slope, that way they don't see me until it's too late. I go to get my radar and holey moley! There's tons of radars and cones in my car. I resist the urge to litter the entire area with radars and decide to just place two instead. That proves to be quite a difficult task though as the radar keeps falling over when I try to put it on the ground. After some effort and planning I manage to get a couple up anyway. A couple of people speed by, the radars automatically issues them a ticket, that's awesome tech. Suddenly this big freakin' truck comes wobbling across the road, I yell for him to stop the vehicle. He swerves into the side of my squad car and stops. I proceed to tell him to exit the vehicle and promptly does a breathalyzer test on him. He's clean. I'm pretty suspicious about the guy though so I ask for compliance, I frisk him and check his ID as well as the plates on the car. Nothing, he's clean, the truck is clean. Oh well, gotta let him go. It's not like I gotta pay the damage on my squad car by myself. Right?... Wrong. I call dispatch and they tell me to be more careful and charge me 600 bucks. I mean, c'mon.\n\nAs I walk back to my freshly repaired car, dispatch calls about a kidnapping. I'm so all over that. I get in my car, blaze my sirens and drive around aimlessly. Where am I supposed to go? I start asking people if they've seen anything suspect. No one has. Dispatch calls again, says they have a possible location. 10-4. As I watch my GPS I realize that when I switch the settings from "mini-map" to "overview map", the map is rotated so they don't look the same. Very unintuitive gear they assign here. Oh well, I manage to find my way at least. I get out my car and draw my gun, I feel my adrenaline pumping. In panic I realize I can't crouch with my gun drawn, I simply can't! I'll have to manage anyway. I see them, a girl lying on the ground and a fat white guy just stands there, looking at me, before I get the chance to tell him to get on the ground, he pulls out a gun. I shoot him in the chest. He staggers but is still alive, he points the gun at me and I shoot him again, right in the chest. He staggers again but he's still standing! What kind of beast is this?! I pop off two more bullets in his chest and stomach. Still standing. One final shot and he's down. Mission complete. 200 points to me. I call an ambulance and they take both the perp and the victim away. No further investigation needed. That's efficient policework. I grab his gun from the ground and get back to stopping cars. There seems to be A LOT of drunk drivers here. One of them swerves right towards me, I panick, my life flash before my eyes and I prepare for permadeath. He crashes straight into me and comes to a complete stop, I didn't even flinch. Seems like I'm made of some tough stuff. I arrest him then I go home to sleep. Busy day.","January 20, 2015","false","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Also driving the car, in which you spend most of your day, is completely unrealistic; shooting is a bit too slow; there are not enough missions, everyday you do the same.

We've all wanted to, at some point, be a police officer, driving around town in our fast police cars with sirens and lights blaring, answering calls and getting bad guys. This game tries to fulfill that childhood dream and has done a darn good job at it. Now I know the graphics arent superb, but the game has plenty to offer. Dense customization of your car and house, 7 different police vehicles to date, and the ability to purchase a personal car that you can drive off-duty. You can also attempt to persuade criminals to surrender, taze them, or shoot them in the face with a pistol, a submachine gun, or a fully automatic assault rifle (3rd option is my go to). Also the map is quite large, and split up into several regions.\n\nIf I were to add/change anything in this game, it'd be as follows: have the ability to call for backup, because as of now you are the only officer in town. Also multiplayer would be nice, maybe even modes where you could play as a cop or a criminal. Also co-op, which would tie in with the "calling for backup". Also I would like the mouse sensitivity inside your house to be the same as outdoors, because inside it is really hard to look/turn around. Also different siren sounds would be nice ( I discovered today that pressing F changes the siren to like a phazer :D)\n\nAnd that just about does it. Thanks for reading this review, I tried not to make it too long. Now I must go, for I have criminals to mow down with an assault rifle! >:)\n","April 4, 2015","true","34.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I imagine the game will get more "intense" as things progress. Stopped one robbery and botched one other investigation...maybe that's why I'm doing meter maid duty...\n\nANYWAY, as for graphics, I'm guessing they'll get updated with time. However, it might be my machine but the game does have a bit of lag, even on lowest graphic settings. As if the game is refeshing in the direction I'm looking, but again, might be my machine.\n\nStory? Nothing so much in the way of Battlefield: Hardline, but I get the feeling that's because not every Police thing is gonna be 'shoot 'em up' and more like "Cops."\n\nWish there was a way to interact with other Officers, maybe even work with a Rookie Officer after you reach a decent enough level. Participate in raids with other AI Officers. As it stands being the ONLY Officer on call for X, Y, and Z time does seem a bit...unrealistic.\n\nTwo shots and you're down! Seriously, this took me by surprise at how REALISTIC that is. Most games give you a "Health Bar" and ways to replenish it. Not this game! One shot, you're okay, two shots, you're pretty much dead.\n\nVoice acting, for what little parts are actually needed, is solid. If the game is expanded to show more, I'd love to see what the people can accomplish here.\n\nOverall if everyone has reached this part of my review, the game is solid. If you're into RPG Style games with LEGIT Police Work and not run around and shoot EVERYONE, get this game. If you're into Open World Games where you can live the life of a Cop, get this game. HOWEVER, if you're looking for a Call of Duty, Battlefield, Shooter Game, this is NOT the game for you. While it has SOME gun play, it's VERY realistic and if you go down, you fail the mission. You have the option to revive in Normal Mode, but in realistic mode, you go down, you go down and you gotta restart from scratch.\n\nSo far, 8/10 due to the lacking of AI interaction with other Officers and the minor bugs I've seen.

On sale for $10 it's an acceptable asking price, anything further is a rip-off.\n\nLong: I mean the basic concept of the game is pretty fun. Unfortunately sooner or later it becomes repeditive or worse. It took me about 14 hours of play time to rank up from level 1 (Officer) to level 15 (Chief of Police). The levels don't really do anything as a far as I can tell, since you are a lone police officer with no backup. As far as ticketing and arrests of daily street crime, this game has got it. Anything else, not implemented. This game would probably benefit from multiplayer and some bug fixes but I don't see that happening. The developer himself stated they are a small studio and originally, they didn't even plan to update this. They did release a few updates because of the amount of interest there is, but if you buy this you should expect that you are purchasing a run-down game. I mean, it's good to kill time, but further then that there is just simply not much to do.\n\nThis game also features an off-duty side, but it's really poorly implemented and boring to do. I usually slept for 6 hours, watched TV 3-5 times and was already to go on duty again. It's really passable and more of an inconvience then anything more.","April 6, 2015","true","15.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Would only want to see more updates, multiplayer, shooting range, add on of becoming a police, ambulance, fire fighter, basicaly choose your career. More of a story on and off duty. One or two officers that you can see pull people over, go to house raids, back you up when chasing someone, call in backup, SWAT teams, bigger missions add in a school or public building that needs heavy backup, helicopters, crashed vehicals, and more questions to ask when pulling someone over. Basically when you pull someone over when you have the mission to put drunk people in jail you can block off a area breathilize them and let them move on.","March 9, 2015","true","44.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Unfortunately, the idea is not followed by graphics - it's ok, but looks old - and sounds - which are quite.. poor? Also driving the car, in which you spend most of your day, is completely unrealistic; shooting is a bit too slow; there are not enough missions, everyday you do the same. The game is also full of smaller or larger technical issues, bugs etc. But you know what? I really enjoyed every minute of Enforcer. I really hope that the developers get rid of those problems and - with more money and time - the game might become perfect for those looking forward to playing any other role, than another criminal or special forces soldier.","February 13, 2015","true","11.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You, the only cop in town, have the authority and people listen to you! While you do the normal missions, dispatch can call you for various emergencies. YOU HAVE TO SLEEP AT LEAST 8 HOURS EACH NIGHT IN ORDER FOR THEM TO KEEP CALLING! Taking two gunshots can get you killed, so gunfights are especially nerve-wracking. Sometimes if you pull over a person and they run, you have to draw your tazer and press C to make them stop.\n\nThere are also realism factors like turn signals, the warning horn, and others. You have to shut off your engine to exit the car, but once you reach 12mph or lower you can press R, the car will stop, and you get out.\n\nLove this game and love that the Devs are still working on it!","June 22, 2015","true","14.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

We've all wanted to, at some point, be a police officer, driving around town in our fast police cars with sirens and lights blaring, answering calls and getting bad guys. This game tries to fulfill that childhood dream and has done a darn good job at it. Now I know the graphics arent superb, but the game has plenty to offer. Dense customization of your car and house, 7 different police vehicles to date, and the ability to purchase a personal car that you can drive off-duty. You can also attempt to persuade criminals to surrender, taze them, or shoot them in the face with a pistol, a submachine gun, or a fully automatic assault rifle (3rd option is my go to). Also the map is quite large, and split up into several regions.\n\nIf I were to add/change anything in this game, it'd be as follows: have the ability to call for backup, because as of now you are the only officer in town. Also multiplayer would be nice, maybe even modes where you could play as a cop or a criminal. Also co-op, which would tie in with the "calling for backup". Also I would like the mouse sensitivity inside your house to be the same as outdoors, because inside it is really hard to look/turn around. Also different siren sounds would be nice ( I discovered today that pressing F changes the siren to like a phazer :D)\n\nAnd that just about does it. Thanks for reading this review, I tried not to make it too long. Now I must go, for I have criminals to mow down with an assault rifle! >:)\n","April 4, 2015","true","34.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I imagine the game will get more "intense" as things progress. Stopped one robbery and botched one other investigation...maybe that's why I'm doing meter maid duty...\n\nANYWAY, as for graphics, I'm guessing they'll get updated with time. However, it might be my machine but the game does have a bit of lag, even on lowest graphic settings. As if the game is refeshing in the direction I'm looking, but again, might be my machine.\n\nStory? Nothing so much in the way of Battlefield: Hardline, but I get the feeling that's because not every Police thing is gonna be 'shoot 'em up' and more like "Cops."\n\nWish there was a way to interact with other Officers, maybe even work with a Rookie Officer after you reach a decent enough level. Participate in raids with other AI Officers. As it stands being the ONLY Officer on call for X, Y, and Z time does seem a bit...unrealistic.\n\nTwo shots and you're down! Seriously, this took me by surprise at how REALISTIC that is. Most games give you a "Health Bar" and ways to replenish it. Not this game! One shot, you're okay, two shots, you're pretty much dead.\n\nVoice acting, for what little parts are actually needed, is solid. If the game is expanded to show more, I'd love to see what the people can accomplish here.\n\nOverall if everyone has reached this part of my review, the game is solid. If you're into RPG Style games with LEGIT Police Work and not run around and shoot EVERYONE, get this game. If you're into Open World Games where you can live the life of a Cop, get this game. HOWEVER, if you're looking for a Call of Duty, Battlefield, Shooter Game, this is NOT the game for you. While it has SOME gun play, it's VERY realistic and if you go down, you fail the mission. You have the option to revive in Normal Mode, but in realistic mode, you go down, you go down and you gotta restart from scratch.\n\nSo far, 8/10 due to the lacking of AI interaction with other Officers and the minor bugs I've seen. Keep going guys, you've made a good game!","April 4, 2015","true","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, the game wasn't as bad as I thought it was. The game does have some good points but I have noticed a few minor errors within the game that should be addressed. First of, there are some mistakes in spellings and grammar. For example in the "Contacts" menu, it says "4+h" when it should say +4h. Moreover, in a some places the developer has forgotten to add a "s" on the end of words.\n\nAnother issue is that the car picks up speed quite quickly making handeling difficult. Moreover, the speed on the roads need to be increased. On long back roads the speed should be 50 or 60 MPH and not 30 MPH. This gets annoying when the NPC drive really slowly and you are stuck behind them...\n\nI am also having an isssue in the car customization and when I change to get on duty where the screen just freezes or I cannot move. I don't know if this is a problem on my side.\n\nRight now I just pull over random cars and find many things wrong with them without me even knowing. For example a car looks fine but when my officer goes to speak to them there registration plates are illegal or their brake lights don't work or they are drunk , but from their driving they don't look drunk... The game needs to add more of a realistic feel when pulling over cars.\n\nOverall, I would give the game 3.5/5 stars. As far as recomending the game to anyone, I am on a fence. This game still need a lot of work and I don't believe it is worth 15 quid. There are better games out there at around the same price. However, once all of the issues have been addressed then the game would be more fun and seem more realistic. It would be cool instead of making the car teleport to the station you could see the actual tow truck or prisoner transport show up and take them. The map also needs to be faced the right way as you do not know how many times I have taken a wrong turn due to the oreintation of the map.The game came out on the 24th October 2014. Right now it is the 9th April 2015. So I'm wondering what the developer has done as the game still feels as a Pre-release or Alpha version and not the full, final version of the game. The game can be fun but as days progess it feels like you are doing the same thing over and over again...\n\nOnce the car controls have been masterd and most other elements of the games have been ironed out this game can become big! The game is fun at the moment but when new features get added the game will be a lot more. Kudos to the develpors as this is their first shot at PC gaming. Hopefully I don't have to change my review. Also get the game whilst it is cheap (7.49 pounds) as I don't see anyone buying this for 15 quid! Thanks for reading.","April 8, 2015","true","5.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As well, vehicle handling, in my opinion is nearly impossible. 0-150 KM/H in 3 seconds? and slowing down.... good luck braking from 150, because when you do, you will lose control of your vehicle, and likely hit a few cars, damaging your police car, forcing you to waste your earned in-game money, and losing score to call a tow truck to fix your car that was damaged beyond believe upon hitting a no parking sign. Until this update comes out, that was promised mid-July, but no notice has been given as to why, in early August, there is still no update. Unless the update covers the biggest issues I can find in this game, such as vehicle handling, ( which also makes it impossible to get into a good position to arrest drug dealers ) this game is lacking. As well, I have seen a few bugs so far, such as people walking over my police car ( yes, they litterally jump up, walk over the roof, down onto the hood, and keep talking on their cell-phones like nothing happened ) or stuck spinning around behind some vehicle they constantly keep walking into. You have alot of work to do devs, and if you ever manage to release the much-awaited, and promised update, I will be happy to revise my review.

You just have to go into it with an open mind that it is still in the works, otherwise all the bugs will irritate you. As of now, everything is pretty routine.  As of now, it's like a mobile game, in the respect that it is just sort of a time killer. Not something you will spend all day playing, but it is fun for a few hours.\n\nIf you like 3rd person games, and a police simulator that is actually pretty in-depth, I do suggest picking this up. Hopefully, it can only get better. They have already patched some irritating issues, like the invisible jumps in the middle of the road that send you into the sky for a meet and greet with jesus christ himself.\n\nWhat can you do?\n\n1.) Stop cars and check registration / Administer breathalizer\n2.) Use NYC's stop and frisk policy on random people walking\n3.) Wait for a call for a suspected murderer, vandalizer, thief, or assault.\n4.) Set up a radar and sit back collecting 30pts per speeder.\n5.) Go home, pay $5 to your fridge to eat, take a shower, watch tv, go to sleep.\n6.) Rank up with points, which unlocks free new cruisers. (Better top speeds.... Goodluck staying on road and stopping.)\n\nThe main bugs that hurt are:\n\nThe randomly disappearing objects, such as a person you are in a foot chase with, or a car that you are attempting to stop. (Mainly because it gets out of range when you try to turn around your charger that steers like a battle tanker)\n\nRandom gun jams on your weapon. The gun sometimes just doesn't fire, which leaves you clicking fast and sometimes unloading a full magazine into somoenes face.\n\nYou cannot relieve stress fast enough. If you try to go out with friends and good ol mom in one day, you get penalized for being off duty too long. And a shower only gives VERY little relief.\n\nCars can, and will run into you.

I just find it so aggravating and tiresome trying to play this game because my character ends up doing things I don't want him to do or I can't figure out how to do something.\n\nOn the flip, the idea behind the game is good. I like the police simulation theme and a lot of the ideas behind traffic stops, speed traps, responding to calls, etc. is really cool. But when I spend the whole (in-game) day trying to do only one of those, the game needs some work. I'm sure if you put enough time and effort into this game, you may get good at it and might actually enjoy it but the learning curve is crazy with this game.

Understandable. But then the publishers and dev team started to slowly get further away from us, they were not telling us what was going on untill they are not telling us why its not out yet.

I tried really hard to love this game, and did at launch. However, it dawned on me just how little there is to do in the game. It also doesn't help that major things just as driving mechanics have not been addressed. Major features that were advertised seem to have no impact on game play, such as the stress mechanic. One issue I did notice was that when cycling through the graphics settings I was unable to go from "ultra" back to low, as the "ultra" setting would automatically crash the game on my PC. However, my computer is FAR from a top of the line gaming rig so I will not count that against the game; but it is something to keep in mind though.\n\nOverall, poor execution on a game that had a lot of potential, and honestly quite a bit of hype surrounding it all things considered.","May 27, 2015","false","5.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Without further developing (by the devs, or by highly skilled modders) this game gets too repetitive to play.  When on duty there're some serious, but acceptable shortcomings.  But off-duty is the most un/under-developed "game" ever, which is highly unacceptable for a "finished" product.  Still enjoyable for a few hours of play each month (until you remember just how bad the off-duty game "mechanics" work).  As a whole I'd give this game a 3/10, if I seperated this into 2 games for "on-duty" and "off-duty"  On would be probably 7/10, while off is a resounding 0.\n\nThis IS a released game, not a greenlight, don't be mistaken.  They are still adding new features (which isn't something a COMPLETE game should need... this is a functional alpha test that's being called full by the devs) so maybe eventually it will become a worthwhile game.","May 23, 2015","false","22.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I was intrigued by the idea of getting to play as a police officer. It is a rarely used idea and one that would make for good fun. This game has an interesting premise but can't deliver. My biggest critiques have to be the driving and the animations. The taser animation makes the suspect look like they are being possessed and you look like your arms are legos. The driving has to be the worst I've seen in a game. You car will keep going long after you let off the gas pedal like your wheels are covered in butter. I found the only reliable way to stop is to turn of your engine. The graphics are ok, not the ugliest thing I've seen.

You just have to go into it with an open mind that it is still in the works, otherwise all the bugs will irritate you. As of now, everything is pretty routine.  As of now, it's like a mobile game, in the respect that it is just sort of a time killer. Not something you will spend all day playing, but it is fun for a few hours.\n\nIf you like 3rd person games, and a police simulator that is actually pretty in-depth, I do suggest picking this up. Hopefully, it can only get better. They have already patched some irritating issues, like the invisible jumps in the middle of the road that send you into the sky for a meet and greet with jesus christ himself.\n\nWhat can you do?\n\n1.) Stop cars and check registration / Administer breathalizer\n2.) Use NYC's stop and frisk policy on random people walking\n3.) Wait for a call for a suspected murderer, vandalizer, thief, or assault.\n4.) Set up a radar and sit back collecting 30pts per speeder.\n5.) Go home, pay $5 to your fridge to eat, take a shower, watch tv, go to sleep.\n6.) Rank up with points, which unlocks free new cruisers. (Better top speeds.... Goodluck staying on road and stopping.)\n\nThe main bugs that hurt are:\n\nThe randomly disappearing objects, such as a person you are in a foot chase with, or a car that you are attempting to stop. (Mainly because it gets out of range when you try to turn around your charger that steers like a battle tanker)\n\nRandom gun jams on your weapon. The gun sometimes just doesn't fire, which leaves you clicking fast and sometimes unloading a full magazine into somoenes face.\n\nYou cannot relieve stress fast enough. If you try to go out with friends and good ol mom in one day, you get penalized for being off duty too long. And a shower only gives VERY little relief.\n\nCars can, and will run into you. Not that it hurts you, as your officer is Bruce Lee, and will ninja jump to the top on the car.","April 25, 2015","false","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The former is tolerable, but the latter could use minor work.\n\nLoad points are.. Obvious, a bit to obvious. You can see their green glow from far across the cell. Other than visually unappealing, they function well.\n\nPerpetrators tend to have three modes, shoot, run, or surrender. When they shoot, it's tolerable, and requires some fast thinking. When they run, there is an issue.. You character can't run as fast as the AI, so being away from your vehicle on foot chases always fail unless you can get them to surrender quickly. When they surrender, there are some arrest issues. Such as when you go code 3 because someone blows through a blockade, pointing a tazer at them costs points. Other times they work fine.\n\nCars/people are unvaried. There are a couple several models for both, different clothings, skin colors, car colors, and issues with the cars. However, increased detail, in-depth conversations, random generated rap sheets and more models and even clothing would make the depth and roleplay value tenfold.\n\nPhysics is... Simple. In Enforcer. Gravity seems to be low. The impact of wrecks causes more of an ice-skating situation. And punching the breaks at high speed causes some interesting/unrealistic sliding. Also, don't worry about running over civilians, they will levitate over your vehicle. And sometimes even run over the top.\n\nVehicle specs/damage could be refined heavily. I have drove a P-71 Highway Inteceptor for a few years. The top speed is not 70mph, it is more in line of 140mph (With the govenor, it's more like 120). All vehicles need the physics refined, and the specs adjusted. The damage to the vehicles could be more specific. Such as flat-tires, optional upgrades for tires, bumpers, lights, ect..\n\nNo fires. Ever. Which is disappointing. Happening upon a field fire would be nice. At least to report.\n\nYou and the dispatcher are the only directly interactable public service. Other police vehicles/paramedics/tows and ect would be nice. Being able to call backup, or to see another officer pulling over speeders would be cool.\n\nCertian situations are cause for arresting someone. There are occassional bugs where someone shooting you will get you punished if you fire at, or arrest them.\n\nMore/better houses could be added, upgrades and all that.\n\nMore weapons/outfits/character customization would be nice. Actual vendors/shops and inventory would be cool.\n\nInstead of taking perps directly to the 200sqft police station/jail you should take them to a penetentary.\n\nTraffic lights and laws for AI needs repaired/overhauled.\n\n\n... I can't think of any more things right now, but I am sure to renew and revise this opinion as the game developes. I would very much like to hear from the developers about my views/opinions.\n\nAll in all.. This game is well worth the price. It is good. It has potental. If you like law enforcement rp, buy it. :)","October 11, 2015","true","12.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game really should be on as early access because it is far from what I would expect from a completed project. The AI is poorly coded, for example I parked at the roadside to set up a speed camera and within seconds 6 npcs were walking continuously against the boot/trunk of my car going nowhere.\n\nWhen you arrest someone they magically teleport to you as you lead them back to your car and if you stand still they start to circle you like a derpy shark. There's no tutorial to explain how anything works (probably because most of it is broken).\n\nThe vehicle handling is laughable and the lack of softbody physics is brought sharply into focus when you crash into a lamp post only to come to an instant halt.\n\nThe camera clips through walls and gets stuck on the outside of the car garage when you drive inside.\n\nThere's an unacceptable number of bugs and poorly delivered gameplay elements here that leaves me astounded that the developer would honestly believe that this was ready to move into beta never mind a full release.\n\nDO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY! Hang on for "Police 10-13" it looks like it could be a great game and more importantly the devs are active with their community.\n\n0/10\n\n","August 25, 2015","false","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As well, vehicle handling, in my opinion is nearly impossible. 0-150 KM/H in 3 seconds? and slowing down.... good luck braking from 150, because when you do, you will lose control of your vehicle, and likely hit a few cars, damaging your police car, forcing you to waste your earned in-game money, and losing score to call a tow truck to fix your car that was damaged beyond believe upon hitting a no parking sign. Until this update comes out, that was promised mid-July, but no notice has been given as to why, in early August, there is still no update. Unless the update covers the biggest issues I can find in this game, such as vehicle handling, ( which also makes it impossible to get into a good position to arrest drug dealers ) this game is lacking. As well, I have seen a few bugs so far, such as people walking over my police car ( yes, they litterally jump up, walk over the roof, down onto the hood, and keep talking on their cell-phones like nothing happened ) or stuck spinning around behind some vehicle they constantly keep walking into. You have alot of work to do devs, and if you ever manage to release the much-awaited, and promised update, I will be happy to revise my review.

This game really should be on as early access because it is far from what I would expect from a completed project. The AI is poorly coded, for example I parked at the roadside to set up a speed camera and within seconds 6 npcs were walking continuously against the boot/trunk of my car going nowhere.\n\nWhen you arrest someone they magically teleport to you as you lead them back to your car and if you stand still they start to circle you like a derpy shark. There's no tutorial to explain how anything works (probably because most of it is broken).\n\nThe vehicle handling is laughable and the lack of softbody physics is brought sharply into focus when you crash into a lamp post only to come to an instant halt.\n\nThe camera clips through walls and gets stuck on the outside of the car garage when you drive inside.\n\nThere's an unacceptable number of bugs and poorly delivered gameplay elements here that leaves me astounded that the developer would honestly believe that this was ready to move into beta never mind a full release.\n\nDO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY! Hang on for "Police 10-13" it looks like it could be a great game and more importantly the devs are active with their community.\n\n0/10\n\n","August 25, 2015","false","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, the game wasn't as bad as I thought it was. The game does have some good points but I have noticed a few minor errors within the game that should be addressed. First of, there are some mistakes in spellings and grammar. For example in the "Contacts" menu, it says "4+h" when it should say +4h. Moreover, in a some places the developer has forgotten to add a "s" on the end of words.\n\nAnother issue is that the car picks up speed quite quickly making handeling difficult. Moreover, the speed on the roads need to be increased. On long back roads the speed should be 50 or 60 MPH and not 30 MPH. This gets annoying when the NPC drive really slowly and you are stuck behind them...\n\nI am also having an isssue in the car customization and when I change to get on duty where the screen just freezes or I cannot move. I don't know if this is a problem on my side.\n\nRight now I just pull over random cars and find many things wrong with them without me even knowing. For example a car looks fine but when my officer goes to speak to them there registration plates are illegal or their brake lights don't work or they are drunk , but from their driving they don't look drunk... The game needs to add more of a realistic feel when pulling over cars.\n\nOverall, I would give the game 3.5/5 stars. As far as recomending the game to anyone, I am on a fence. This game still need a lot of work and I don't believe it is worth 15 quid. There are better games out there at around the same price. However, once all of the issues have been addressed then the game would be more fun and seem more realistic. It would be cool instead of making the car teleport to the station you could see the actual tow truck or prisoner transport show up and take them. The map also needs to be faced the right way as you do not know how many times I have taken a wrong turn due to the oreintation of the map.The game came out on the 24th October 2014. Right now it is the 9th April 2015. So I'm wondering what the developer has done as the game still feels as a Pre-release or Alpha version and not the full, final version of the game. The game can be fun but as days progess it feels like you are doing the same thing over and over again...\n\nOnce the car controls have been masterd and most other elements of the games have been ironed out this game can become big! The game is fun at the moment but when new features get added the game will be a lot more. Kudos to the develpors as this is their first shot at PC gaming. Hopefully I don't have to change my review. Also get the game whilst it is cheap (7.49 pounds) as I don't see anyone buying this for 15 quid! Thanks for reading.","April 8, 2015","true","5.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

(Could have been better for you to always be on duty, in my opinion.)\n-To go off duty, if you are in a remote region you must pass through other regions to get to the police station, you will get assigned rutine missions as you pass through each sector. This might not seem like a problem to you now but when you start to get into the game you will find it very anoying.\n-Firefights are very random, example: Stop a normal car on a rutine alchohol check, car stops, driver gets out and starts running away, i persue the driver through the streets, she stops, turns around and puts hands in the air, I tazz her (my bad) and she just pulls out a gun, pumps me full of lead and BUM! Im in the hospital.\n\nThis game had a lot of potential but franckly is not worth your time.\n\n-P.S: Game stopped working when I stop civilian vehicules, the keyboard is disabled and I cant do anything.

Being single player it is nice to have to pass the time with when you get burnt out on other games.\n\nPROs:\nSemi-moddable.  You cannot bring in custom models (that I have seen anyways), however you can cusomize vehicle skins, player skins and just about an other graphic, sound, or text file in the game if you know what you are doing.\n\nCONs:\nSingle player only, inconsistant vehicle handling, AI don't always cooperate.\n\nI have over 270 hours on Enforcer: Police, Crime, Action.  One of my favorite things to do is create custom textures for the vehicles.  I have found that the models are not the best for doing this but you get used to the quirks the more textures you make.\n\nI also enjoy just hopping on and doing a quick tour of duty when I need a break from website work or other games such as GTA.  Although this is not a AAA game I would still recommend to anyone that wants something small that can be used as a decent way to take a break from it all.","April 12","true","258.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A lot of what's said from dispatch, or the written text, is odd and strikes me as non-English speakers who've never watched Cops trying to write dialog.  I would expect less "There's a murderer on the loose" and more "Shots fired; civilian casualties" or "Armed suspect reported" or the like.  Google searches reveal that the dialog used to be even worse, so this is *after improvement*.\n\nThere isn't much polish; the little things will constantly eat at you.  Like, trying to back up your squad car feels clunky, or having it slide backwards down a hill when it's parked (which I guess is fixed in the latest patch).  You basically harass and pull over random people to try and make your quotas, with only a few traffic violations being "externally visible".  I will say I was really impressed when, at night, I could actually see people with their headlights broken and ticket them for it.  That was cool, I'll give them that!\n\nYou can't pull people over for running lights, you can't issue tickets for accidents.  The game doesn't seem to care if you, yourself, drive recklessly and there doesn't seem to be a penalty for damaging innocent cars.  Scarface: The World Is Yours had better traffic law mechanics.  I couldn't even pull over a truck that ran a light, then rammed into a street light and blocked an intersection.\n\nAnd finally, the weather; when it started raining, the sound of the storm was really overwhelming and irritating.  And it was raining inside the police station, which was great.  In my house, at least it wasn't raining in there but it was still equally loud as outside.  Really obnoxious.\n\nOne of the things that made Police Quest cool was they actually hired law enforcement folks to help design the game.  I'd love these guys to take another shot at this game, with Enforcer 2, and actually hire a cop to help them make it.  Despite all my problems with this game, I really want to love it, and I really tried to, so please try again.","March 13","false","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A lot of what's said from dispatch, or the written text, is odd and strikes me as non-English speakers who've never watched Cops trying to write dialog.  I would expect less "There's a murderer on the loose" and more "Shots fired; civilian casualties" or "Armed suspect reported" or the like.  Google searches reveal that the dialog used to be even worse, so this is *after improvement*.\n\nThere isn't much polish; the little things will constantly eat at you.  Like, trying to back up your squad car feels clunky, or having it slide backwards down a hill when it's parked (which I guess is fixed in the latest patch).  You basically harass and pull over random people to try and make your quotas, with only a few traffic violations being "externally visible".  I will say I was really impressed when, at night, I could actually see people with their headlights broken and ticket them for it.  That was cool, I'll give them that!\n\nYou can't pull people over for running lights, you can't issue tickets for accidents.  The game doesn't seem to care if you, yourself, drive recklessly and there doesn't seem to be a penalty for damaging innocent cars.  Scarface: The World Is Yours had better traffic law mechanics.  I couldn't even pull over a truck that ran a light, then rammed into a street light and blocked an intersection.\n\nAnd finally, the weather; when it started raining, the sound of the storm was really overwhelming and irritating.  And it was raining inside the police station, which was great.  In my house, at least it wasn't raining in there but it was still equally loud as outside.  Really obnoxious.\n\nOne of the things that made Police Quest cool was they actually hired law enforcement folks to help design the game.  I'd love these guys to take another shot at this game, with Enforcer 2, and actually hire a cop to help them make it.  Despite all my problems with this game, I really want to love it, and I really tried to, so please try again.","March 13","false","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Now, although I agree that this game should still be labled as early access, I really gives you what you would expect. So, unless you don't mind bugs much, I wouldn't buy this game.

It's not that it's just completely horrible, it's not. However, the game controls are really hard to use and the movement/action of the character is not smooth by any twist of the word. I just find it so aggravating and tiresome trying to play this game because my character ends up doing things I don't want him to do or I can't figure out how to do something.\n\nOn the flip, the idea behind the game is good. I like the police simulation theme and a lot of the ideas behind traffic stops, speed traps, responding to calls, etc. is really cool. But when I spend the whole (in-game) day trying to do only one of those, the game needs some work. I'm sure if you put enough time and effort into this game, you may get good at it and might actually enjoy it but the learning curve is crazy with this game. I'm sorry but I don't recommed this game.","March 19","false","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Simply put, the graphics were so bad, I thought my computer was tripping because it has a great graphics card. But no, it looks like it was made in 2000 and looks outdated. The towns don't have alot of detail, the cars handling is way off balanced, and overall, I'd rather play LSPDFR since it's actually more than decent even thought it's a mod for GTA V. It doesn't look like the developers care and only made the game for a quick buck. I don't recommend this game to anyone,","May 2","false","15.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Well, at least devs are fixing it. But then I found out that there is only ONE developers working on this game who tells his community about a year to release a proper update, but still..there has been updates but they did not fix any of the issues. When you try to ask for help about specific issues or try to discuss them with other players, your thread gets locked or even removed immediately.\n\nThis game is probably the biggest waste of money. I never was as frustrated paying money for a game like for this one.\nBesides that, the price is ridiculously high. £ 15.00 is just way too much. To even buy this game for £ 1 or £ 2 you probably have to be very drunk or on acid.\n\nHighly NOT recommended. Do not buy this game and do not make the same mistake as thousands of others who wasted money on this " game ".\n\n","May 16","false","8.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'd like to see a little more variety in tasks. It'd be good to iron out a few little visual bugs - like when someone gets out of a vehicle - there's still someone sitting inside, or when you tell someone they're free to go, and they still stand there gormlessly. An auto-rest option would be good - as it's pretty repetitive at the end of a shift to have to go home and watch the tv 4 times. The directing traffic option does nothing other than make you look silly.\n\nIt's a good base game - has a lot of positives going for it - but if ever there's a version 2 - could do with a lot of improvement. If you just like the idea of cruising around in a police car issuing tickets and catching drunks, it'll keep you happy.","May 26","true","35.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
