Since 2 days I own this game and already clocked over 20 hours. I've played several sandbox building games, such as Minecraft, 7 Days to die, Arma 2 and 3 epoch (if you want to count that) and many more.\n\nThe difference with many other games, is that in this game, nature is your enemy, such as bears. With that approach, it is different from most other survival games. It is nice for a change not to have zombies constantly chasing you and always find you no matter what you do.\n\nFor construction you use resources you gather on the map like wood and stone and with workbenches you can turn it into the kind of wood or stone that you find, looks appealing. Besides that, you can change it into many shapes to make your building look original in design or create tools and materials such as furniture. it uses similar physics as Minecraft. Except that trees come down completely when cut  down (no more chasing leaves that float in the sky).\n\nEven though the game is in early access, it has a lot to offer already. The development team is very active, also on the forums. The last update caused a bug and was  reported by several players and the developer promised to still fix it the same day, which they did a few hours after.\n\nIf you like building games with survival aspects and much nicer graphics than most building games available today, this game certainly deserves your support to make this into one of the best building games ever made.\n\nI  wish the development team all the best with the further development of this game.\n","May 28, 2015","true","143.4"," 195 of 220 people (89%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","89","195","220","12","0"

That being said,  I have a lot of good things to say about this game, I as well would like to point out some things that I hope help the development team along their way should they read this. I have clocked 5.6 hours - SO FAR - into the game by the way so I haven't experienced everything yet. Here is my review on what I have seen so far - warning, it is lengthy as I have comments for the Devs too.\n\n\nRising world is a Survival game but in its current condition it is more of a Creative play - which that by the way has been promised to be added later on as a playable game, I look forward to this (so for those of you that do not want to worry about monsters chasing after you, right now, there are none - made me REAL happy to see for now).\n\n\n+ Graphics: They feel rustic, they allow players to use Modern Day graphics pre-built into the game itself to allow for a more modern-day game play and there are the fantasy graphics available to allow players who wish to go back to Ye ol merry times in ol' Camelot to have some fun as well. *The grass is beautiful*, the trees have a very nicely thought out animation when chopped down and the sounds they make are just incredible!\n\n- Graphics: As I said, they are rustic. I am expecting this to get slightly better as more funding becomes available. *The grass in this game - though beautiful as previously stated - will quickly get on your last nerve. Reason being: objects are hidden in the grass and you have no way to cut it until you establish yourself a base of operations basically. It is too tall, Devs, make it just slightly shorter and I think we would be good. If you can't even see the melons you are standing directly next to, we have a problem here (and I'm not going to talk about the apples disappearing issue).\n\n+ Lighting: It is fantastic, that's really understating it too! Torches are beautiful looking, lamps are smooth and light 'just' the right amount of area. These were all done very well - great job guys!\n\n-  Lighting: Though nice it has its drawbacks as well... Environmental drawbacks. At one point you could be standing next to a torch placed on the ground and turned to your right where two trees (or even that tall grass again) is at that and each tree will be affected by the torch differently (weird, not annoying, just weird). The grass could have some grass directly next to your campfire not lit up at all, but take some steps further into the grass and you will find orange light lighting up the grass a bit further back. I am certain this is just a calculation issue with the light mapping that will be cleared up at a later date, but it is still worth mentioning here for the Devs.\n\n+ Overall Mining: This is a beautifully done digging process, and the sounds along with this were incredible just as much as the trees or torches are. The graphical side to the digging is nicely done, as the pick hits the rock cracks a little more with each smack. The wholes created make sense as the player beats on the rocks, they are small and rough not smooth and round (or square) causing you to actually make bigger holes to get your large body through. The endless ravines under the ground are incredible - some paths lead to dead ends, others lead to very deep holes you do NOT want to fall down. Well done Devs!\n\n- Overall Mining: There are a few things to mention here for this. Though the mining is done nicely, it takes a while to break the rocks - but this is a fine balance between taking too long and way to quick, so it’s really just a preference to each person playing. The holes created are very nice, as mentioned above, but can also be very annoying if you do not hit the rock wall just right. I understand you were aiming for a not-so-perfect feeling, but something isn't right there as the ground will crack and form and then you have a sudden dip in your floor that you were not trying to make just because you broke down a large stalagmite in your way. You might want to look at the calculations for this or something... ORE! Ore was nowhere to be found. Now, I'm not sure if this is just because it is still in the process of being worked on or what, but some people could find ore some could find iron - I played 3 different tester worlds and found nothing but dirt and stone, and I dug. A LOT. The ratio here is WAY off... you might want to look into that Devs.\n\n+ Building: There is NOTHING negative to say here at all. Only positives. The Building is done extremely well! The options you are given are limitless it feels. I am seriously impressed with this... You can twist, turn, enlarging, shrink and even mass-place objects into the world - all while either free-handing the placement, or using a customizable grid to assist with snapping things together. Above all things needing to be worked on, THIS needs nothing done to it (except maybe allowing for smaller or large sizes on things - but I digress).\n\n*Oh! I do have one thing to point out Devs... The Glass Panes. They are annoying as all out to try and see in the world. I would love to suggest maybe some kind of outline on it or something to assist in viewing it, just makes seeing what size it is or where exactly you placing it a lot easier.\n\n- Animals: I really don't have a lot of positives here for the animals. They are almost all currently empty as they are still in development, minus the pigs and I believe it was the cow. They make for some good grilled meat meals I assure you! But the SPEED of the animals is ridiculous... I was at a flat out run while chasing a sheep and (I think) an antelope and they were out running me. Not nice when I cannot find any food and the only thing around me is livestock with food and I cannot catch it to survive. The pigs are relatively easy to kill, but forget the sheep at the moment.\n\n*Hint for you guys... I got up behind the animals and with my pick I dug a fairly deep hole under the animal to cause it to fall down into it then slaughtered them in there that way, only way I could finally catch the antelope.\n\n**Multiplayer: This really doesn't get a plus or minus to it as I really couldn't get involved with any servers that had people on them or was English (or at least not English enough to ask detailed questions). But I DID need to make sure and thank those that allowed me to use their servers to test the Multiplayer function out on:\n\nThank you   Neue Welt PVE   and Thank You   Hessenstrolche eXz-Hosting Server!\nAnemon was extremely kind and very helpful in all ways that he/she could be, then Pinky on his/her server was extremely kind and answered what he/she could for me as well.\n\nBOTH individuals shared their massive worlds with me and allowed me to look around on them to see the many different ways this game permitted you to build. I was greatly impressed and HIGHLY encouraged to keep on building (many ideas were formed thanks to these two servers).\nOnce more:   THANK YOU EVERYONE ON BOTH SERVERS!\n\nGeneral Game overview:\nI LIKE IT! It is highly entertaining in such an early stage and is on the fast track to (sadly) beat Minecraft in entertainment. Yes, it is a little expensive at $15 for an Alpha-based game, but think of it this way... You are now involved in a game where you can voice your opinion on how the development of the game should/might turn out. YOU have the voice to help make changes in the game. It is fun, entertaining and once you figure out all the little tricks (you know, like the Light button and such) then you will find the game very hard to walk away from.\n\nWell done JIW Games, you are doing splendidly so far!","March 11, 2015","true","31.2"," 89 of 100 people (89%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","89","89","100","8","0"

Since this is an EA game, it's perfectly reasonable that later on there will be much more added and the game will feel more complete.Therefore, my review may change accordingly.\n\nSo, this game is obviously similar to Minecraft. I am not going to go into detail on whether it's a clone or not (to me it doesn't feel like one) but it's fair to say that the basic gameplay will be familiar to Minecraft players.\n\nThe graphics are pretty, not top notch, but beautiful in their own way and style. To me, the blockiness of Minecraft was unimmersive, so Rising World gives a nice visual alternative to people like myself.\n\nSound is also well made. The music is nice and relaxing and the effects are fairly well done and don't detract  from the experience. Only point to make here would be to add a bit of variety here and there but this is in alpha so things like this are excused.\n\nGameplay as mentioned in similar to Minecraft. The main difference is that the world is not blocky, so it may get a bit of getting used to mining ,for example, since it's a bit more realistic (you mine chunks off the rock, rather than square blocks, so you get a bit disorientated after a while). I would say the gameplay is reminiscent of Rust, especially when it comes to gathering resources (obviously excluding mining).That being said I found the gameplay enjoyable.\n\nAs far as bugs are concerned, I did notice a few visual bugs that are excused for an EA game but nothing gamebraking, as some other people have experienced. So, in that regard kudos for the good state of the game. I didn't feel like I got cheated in any way.\n\nGenerally, the game has a very nice ambience and I found myself being immersed into it, for the first few hours at least. I started mining downwards and quickly found a web of interlaced tunnels and caves waiting to be explored and precious ores to be mined. A couple of hours later and I pop out of the ground a few miles away from my base, finally seeing the light of day once more.\n\nAll in all Rising World is a very nice game with great atmosphere sure to keep you company for a while. So, why the negative review? Simply put, the game as of now is very bare bones. If you like to do anything other than just build stuff there is simply zero interest after the first few hours.\n\nThe game offers nothing in regards to exploration or adventure, something that becomes evident after a good underground venture into the dark, subterranean caves. The only thing that poses a danger are bears and personally I didn't even encounter one in my first few hours. Additionally, the world is lacking some sort of landmarks to orientate yourself (Rust had the road to follow and a few very specific buildings, so you had a rough idea of where you are). Therefore if you die you practically lose your progress. More to the point, the world feels a bit faceless, as it's just a randomly generated grassland with nothing of note.\n\nSo, taking the above into account the game is currently not worth the money it is asking out of you and is recommended only to avid builders. That being said, it's obviously an EA title and , contrary to other EA games, it seems like the developer(s) is active and invovled in the forums and thus it feels like he could take this game somewhere eventually.\n\nIf you like what you see and would like to support the developer, consequently helping him improve the game and add features faster, buy it. The price is not THAT steep anyway. If you are looking for something more fleshed out and ready to be explored you may want to wait for a few months. Personally, I don't regret spending the money, but I did so as an investment for the future.","October 6, 2015","false","10.5"," 221 of 292 people (76%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","76","221","292","10","12"

More features have been implemented and the game is as fantastic as ever!\n\n26 Jan 2016 Early Access Review\n\nI was bored last weekend and figured I'd give an EA game another shot.  After clocking ten hours in three or so days, I must say I am impressed with the amount of content so far.  Think minecraft alpha after the redstone update.  There is no electricity yet so that might have been a bad analogy but still, the content is enough for the time being.\n\nPlenty of different blocks and you can turn them into different shapes to meet your building needs.  No, I'm not talking stairs, pyramids and squares, I'm talking rounded corners and a myriad of other different curved shapes.  This can let you build that tower you always wanted but got hosed by minecrafts limitations.  I shouldn't really compare this to minecraft, it's just in the same genre not the same game.  Yes you mine, you build, and you eat to survive but that is where the similarities end.  You build tables with different variants and colors depending on what you want.  You cna go medieval or you can go modern or a mix of both.  Plenty of different blocks like marble, stone, cobblestone, sandstone, loam, metal, wood, the list goes on.\n\nBiomes were introduced last month based on the update news.  So far I've seen the temperate, tundra, and safari.  I took an axe to an elephant and got wrecked.  Bears...well get a weapon to say the least.  Mountains and ditches as well as caves and ravines are plentiful.  Penguins, moose, chicken, sheep, bear, cows, pigs, giraffe, and elephants galore.  I managed to dig down far enough after a few days of playing to get to hell.  The only place that a liquid exists.  Word of advice, don't fall in, it's easy to do.\n\nOutside of those features there are a crap ton of ores.  Copper, iron, silver, gold, tungsten, mithril, cobalt, and aluminum.   Some of these don't have any apparent use yet but they are working on that.  Water is presumeably the next update as well.  This should make getting something to drink in the game easier as right now you eat apples or watermelon to get rehydrated.\n\nThe music is very ambient and sporadic.  Everything seems to flow and I haven't glitched to my death yet.  You can rotate things you are about to place as well as even out the land whether it be dirt or solid rock.  Nothing like a sledgehammer to make that wall flat!  I started a tomato farm but haven't really went beyond that.\n\nFor a game that has been out for as long as it has, I was expecting more.  However, there is still plenty to do and build.  I'm not sure how many more world wipes will  be necessary but it isn't a big deal as I enjoy building in this game.\n\n\nMultiplayer works well.  You can host straight off of your computer to jump right in or you can host a dedicated server.  This can be either on a separate box or it can be one that you pay for in the event you are not network savvy ro simply don't have the capability to host a server for whatever reason.  At the current time I give this game a thumbs up.  Time will tell but I think with the constant support and active development team, this could turn into a masterpiece.  Just keep in mind this is still an alpha build.","January 26","true","39.9"," 85 of 96 people (89%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","89","85","96","5","8"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/recommended/324080/","markdj","dj.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/","2975 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nIntroductionAt first sight Rising World looks like a more technically advanced version of Minecraft: it is also an open-world sandbox game where you can do whatever you want to do. We’ve seen tens of these games come by the last couple of years, some a bit tougher/challenging than others, but the basics always remained the same. Will Rising World be the game to finally bring something new to the table or is it just more of the same and therefore better to avoid it?\n\nGameplayI know I’m in the minority here, but I never really saw the appeal in playing Minecraft. I know I won’t make any friends by saying this but I just couldn’t get into it. God knows I’ve tried. But ultimately it just wasn’t interesting enough for me to keep playing it. I thought the crafting mechanics were frustrating and cumbersome while the defensive gameplay was mostly unchallenging. But that was years ago and I realize things might have changed for the better.\n\nI could go into more detail as far as the main gameplay is concerned, but it all really comes down to gathering materials, crafting items and building shelter, all the while maintaining your hunger and thirst to avoid dying. That’s basically what it all comes down to, but of course you won’t be able to do it in a matter of minutes; it’s all been stretched out to make it a more complete experience. A journey, if you will.\nIt’s absolutely not my intention to sound like Negative Nancy here, because the concept just works and a lot of people still seem to enjoy it, but if you never were into games like this then it’s likely it won’t suddenly make you a (big) fan.\n\nThe game generates a random open world each time you start a new game so if you’re tired of your current world then you just press a button and BAM!: you have an entirely new world to play in/with.\nEvery object can also be interested with in some way, which is very cool and makes the world feel more believable. And everything can be destroyed as well. How great is that? There might still be some bugs and glitches, but there’s technically speaking nothing wrong with this game. It’s quite impressive.\n\nThe ultimate goal of the game is to build your own world to your own liking. There’s a reason why it’s called a sandbox game; you are absolutely free to pursue whatever you would like to do. Want to chop down every tree available to you can create the most epic things ever then you’re free to do so. Want to try and kill all animals? Craft a weapon and go for it! Okay, these are really terrible examples, but what I’m trying to say is that there’s no limit to what you can do (well, there is, but it’s limited to the available tools).\nBut while it is still a work-in-progress there definitely needs to be more of a challenge right now. But I understand that there will always be a group that doesn’t want a bigger challenge; they just want to build stuff. And that’s perfectly fine, of course; just let people choose if they want a relaxing or tenser experience (survival aspect) by letting them select a checkbox before generating the world.\n\nAn early survival aspect has also been partially implemented, but at the moment it’s still far from complete. While some things are already in place (thirst and hunger) the focus right now is still to build stuff. I expect that this aspect will be more feature complete in a year or so and when it is finally complete I’m sure it will give you an entirely different experience. I expect there to be more hostile animals/enemies, for example, while having to manage/juggle the multiple meters will make things more challenging in general.\n\nAnyway, if you’re not so good at all of this (in general) then you can simply ask/invite a friend to help you out. It might even be the better experience because it feels more like you have a purpose and all people involved will usually benefit from this shared experience since you’ll be interacting with one another and this way also get to learn from each other.\n\nAudio & VisualsThe audio suffices in my opinion: there’s not a lot of fancy effects, which is understandable for a game in this genre, and the music remains mostly in the background without getting obtrusive.\nIt’s obvious the audio doesn’t have the biggest focus (yet) but right now it complements the game in a good, relaxing way. Don’t go in and expect too much from it and you will never be disappointed. One of my favorite mottos.\n\nAs expected Rising World has a more detailed world in comparison to games like Minecraft. It looks quite beautiful and detailed actually. The engine also can handle environmental destruction without breaking a sweat. That’s an impressive feat. All of the crafted items are nicely modeled and have good detail. Same goes for the animals, but these could use a tiny bit more detail in my opinion. Nevertheless, this is a beautiful game, way more immersive than Minecraft.\n\nLength/Replay ValueAs with all other open-world sandbox games there’s basically infinite replay value here. You could spend hours in the same world without ever getting bored, or you could play in one for a few weeks and then just start another one. Potentially you could put hundreds of hours into it, and that’s impressive. It all depends on your own interest and imagination. And in this case also on the developer, since the game is still being actively worked on and more content will have be added regularly to keep things from becoming too repetitive.\n\nConclusionI’m very sorry to say that Rising World also doesn’t bring anything new to the table. It’s a good game, a more beautiful clone even, but that is really it: a good game. It’s very similar to all the other open-world sandbox survival/building games that we’ve all at least played once before. I’ve personally grown tired of these games; they don’t do anything revolutionary. All they do is evolve, just barely, and I can’t express how sad that makes me. But… if you’ve never played a game like this before then Rising World will probably be a good introduction to the genre: technically speaking it’s really great and what’s already there content-wise is pretty solid. Or give it a try if you’re looking for something a little (just a little) different, but still in the same genre.\n\nToo long, didn’t readPros:\n+ Lovely graphics\n+ Lots of items to use and craft\n+ Randomly generated, open, worlds\n+ You can put tons of hours into it and never get bored\n+ Multiplayer adds extra fun\n\nMixed:\n+/- It’s not really a con - I really can’t fault the game here as it was a conscious design choice - but it unfortunately doesn’t bring anything truly new to the genre\n\nCons:\n- Minecraft (or games similar to it) haters need to look further; if it didn’t interest you then then it is likely this won’t interest you now either\n- Needs more content and features to keep things interesting\n- Survival aspect still in its infancy\n\nPlease note: a Steam key for this game was provided by the developer.\nRating: 7.4 (out of 10)(Ratings aren’t calculated based on a formula, but on my personal feelings)\n\n\nPlease feel free to join my group, DJ’s reviews, or follow me directly as a curator.\nDon’t feel like it?

It's nice to have a similar gaming experience in a realistic environment however, despite the increased realism Minecraft still wins out on a couple of fronts.\n\n1. MC feels more like a survival game (I always preferred the challenge of dodging MOBs, it made the game feel more 'real'.)\n\n2. You can start building more quickly in MC, building huge projects in RW is definitely a massive undertaking.\n\nOverall though, RW is an enjoyable sandbox experience until it starts to feel a bit too much like hard work (probably not for the hardcore sandbox builders though).\n\nOne thing I loved about the game was - ironically - a glitch. Once in a while the game would freeze and a few seconds later it would unfreeze and I'd either be underground or in the air and could see through the ground. I managed to look down upon a long winding tunnel that I had spent an hour or so digging and it was cool to see the 'big picture' of my efforts. Any chance of making this an actual feature in the game?\n\nWhilst playing, I imagined a game similar to this, but with aspects of a city building/ RTS game built in, whereby if you managed to construct an appealing mine/ village/ building with a road attached, that miners/villagers/ workers would gradually start to move in to your creation, moving around freely and interacting with you and the environment. I'd love to see a game something like that in the future, basically a first person city/ town construction game working literally from the ground up. If anyone knows of a game like that please let me know!\n\nIn short. Would reccomend to those who love sandbox building and don't mind hours of tedious mining, smelting, crafting and construction. If you already LOVE everything about Minecraft, chances are you'll enjoy this game for a while but revert back to MC before too long.","December 23, 2015","true","35.7"," 64 of 73 people (88%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","88","64","73","9","0"

Honestly it is Minecraft next gen. Obviously being Alpha there are a lot of things that need to be tweaked, added, removed and contemplated over but in the state this game is currently in it's more of a time waster than anything.\n\nThe current features include:\n* Digging\n* Cutting down trees\n* Very limited crating\n* And placing some items, including bricks for basic structure.\n\nIn the long run for this game to really draw people in and become "The New Thing" it will need better animation when it comes to player models, animals etc.\n\n-Much more content added. There are animals roaming around that you beat to death then can't actually loot anything off of them.\n\n-The UI at this point in time is sloppy, as well as the sensitivity of the mouse... I had to turn mine up to max in order to get a normal gameplay experience and not having to drag my mouse to the other edge of the mouse pad to look an inch to the left. And it seems to get worse when you are trying to move items around in your inventory.\n\n-The map needs some tweaking for more accurate digging etc, I know voxels have a mind of their own but this really needs to be refined otherwise you dig somewhere and it creates a huge hole and some places are smoothed etc.\n\n-Recourse collection system and crafting will have to be tweaked a lot. At the moment it takes about 30 seconds to a minute to cut a tree down, then another 30 seconds to a minute to remove the stump and cut the tree up only to be left with 5 - 10 logs which = 4 blocks to place. I can understand where they want some realism there but even if you were given 8 blocks it would be a better system.\n\n-At the moment you cannot pick up any crafting tables you place. These cost 16 planks I believe to make, that 4 logs. so roughly 2 minutes to create a crafting table only to have it stay in the once place. If you try to 'break' it to pick it up it simply gets rid of it and you have to create another.\n\n\n*NOTE*\nI understand this game is Alpha, more Pre-Alpha than anything as it really is just the basics, more like the start of a survival sim/adventure/open world game. I am giving this a thumbs up BUT I would suggest you wait till it comes on special to purchase as there isn't enough content to justify the $15 price tag at this point in time, $5 - $10 would be much better.\n\nBeing Alpha I also understand there is going to be a lot of tweaking done and all of the issues or... opinions I brought up could be fixed, added, and/or removed within a week. It’s simply a guide/ feedback for everybody including the developers.\n\n\n\nI will be sure to update/ change my review as updates come out or I discover anything worth talking about!\n\n\n\nThanks for reading\n","December 18, 2014","true","2.3"," 125 of 167 people (75%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","75","125","167","5","0"

However whilst browsing steam today Rising World caught my eye, so i thought why not take a chance and give one a go? I'm so glad i did! This game is one of most stable alpha build games i've ever played and it is a lot of fun even in this early stage. For a Voxel game it looks really impressive, especially on the higher graphical settings (the screenshots don't do it justice) and the sound assets are great. Plus it is just so much fun tunneling through mountains and building bases with such a large array of options. Also i freakin love the ability to put your own images in the game as posters/paintings. So do i recommend this game? Absolutely!\n\nNow one last message for the Devs in the event that they read this.\nYou are sitting on a gold mine so if you want to be rich do not stop until this game meets it's potential!

Absolutely! It should honestly be higher than what it is. Price is only going to go up with future patches, which won't be long judging by the speed of content released so far.\n\nAmazing building game with immense potential and a great crafting system. The system is too vast to list here, so I would suggest checking out some gameplay videos on youtube to get a glimpse of it. Basically it's like minecraft on steroids, without the tiny balls. The graphics are great too, except for players though.. they look disturbing.\n\nCurrently (time of writing this review) it's basically only a building game with very minimal survival aspects: food/thirst, aggressive bears, and some animals that fight back, all of which are easy to overcome. The friendly animals are cows, pigs, sheep, foxes, and rabbits. Neutral animals that will defend themselves are goats and moose. The only hostile creatures are bears that will attack you on sight, but are easily defeated once you learn how to manipulate their bad movement system. There is also no water yet, so my suggestion is to play this on single player creative mode because servers/worlds will likely be useless once water and other updates are released. Also because it takes less time to gather and being able to fly allows for easier building (which is what this game currently is).\n\nThere are some glitches and bugs, but I am going to type this next part in caps for a reason...\nUNLIKE MOST ALPHA GAMES, THIS IS UPDATED/PATCHED REGULARLY AND THE DEVS LISTEN TO FEEDBACK!\nSome games have made thousands, even millions of $ and never come out of alpha... literally never. Other games act like they're running a political campaign and promise things that sound great, then deliver nothing but more words. This definitely isn't one of those, and that alone is why it's worth buying now. Also because they've basically said that once they release more content, the price will go up.","May 5, 2015","true","23.8"," 87 of 111 people (78%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","78","87","111","12","4"

This one looks pretty much on par with the rest but its really not a game yet. Whether it will be remains to be seen but in my  experience these games never get more than a few tweaks and a couple of additions before going silent.\n\nRising World is nothing exrordinary. It has a lot of animals which is great but  other than running up and twatting them (which is bumpy to say the least) theres nothing you can do with them. This game promises to be crafting rich but really all I can see mostly vanity items so im unsure how much will be added with any praticallity that would make you want to grind mats for them.\n\nOn that note the material load is poor , wood and stone  are all  there is, and for 20 minutes you will have fun making the items and the building system being smart actually makes it fairly quick to bulld a house, unlike TUG materials are bountiful and go a long way and your tools currently from what I can see are indestructable.  This seems like a good idea but actually leaves little to do. Once you have build a shack and crafted a few useless items you'll notice your food gauge hasnt dropped at all ...and that one pumpkin you've found in 12 miles of walking is actually not even useable.\n\nThat's right food is not actually in the game yet!  so no need to look for it or think about it at all, I raked out 2 large squares for farms and was very dissapointed to know that farming  is not there either yet , this is survival and in my oppinion no game in this genre should be adding any features until food is ready or even launch a game in Alpha state for that matter. The scenery is bland , very nice graphics but then 3 trees types some grassland and samey mountain ranges couldnt have been too difficult to nail, At least TUG keeps it eye pleasing allbeit a bit ecclectic and keeps you grinding to have a supply of tools and materials.\n\nSome things look nice and if they keep to their promise of features and an 'Adventure mode' then this could be a good game , but I have that same feeling I have when buying one of these games and that is that I've paid for a concept that will never truly improve to a point where you can really enjoy the game.\n\n\nThe biggest thing that pisses me off in this game is I've randomly fell through the floor several times and when this happens you're essentially ♥♥♥♥ed, the game doesnt return you to you tent so finding home is an impossible task once you die, This is a stupid oversight which makes me not even want to play, whats the point of spending 2 hours making a home to have that happen","January 7, 2015","false","6.9"," 494 of 738 people (67%) found this review helpful 53 people found this review funny","67","494","738","53","42"

Along with the dynamics is the mining tool which will dig out a certain area of dirt or stone depening on which you are mining and just the detail alone is nice, but you can not really make just a straight line which is more real to life. There are actual roots on the trees which i thought was a nice touch and the stump counts as one log as well. Depending on how tall the tree is will determine how many times you need chop at it with the Axe.\n\nGraphic wise you have lush tall grass flowing in the wind along with swaying trees, the bark looks like bark, the dirt looks like dirt, rock looks like rock , there a few animals, Cow/Pig/Goat all lovely done. The trees themselves when they fall keep there dynamic shape and look really cool when rolling down a hill. The lighting is nicely done as well, looks as though they used a spectrum on them, like if your in tunnel and a torch is around a bend it will not shine light down the tunnel as the light itself is blocked by the corner or stone in the way.\n\nWould say they are off to a great start and I am sure if they keep it up will add alot more to the game to make it more compatible to everyones taste, I personally hope they add fishing so I can feed the bears they have not yet implamented (maybe).\n\nWould say if you like minecraft this is defently your upgrade. minus all the sniper skellies and bonzi creepers.","January 16, 2015","true","102.8"," 69 of 85 people (81%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","81","69","85","18","0"

Runs fairly well even on an old system.  Lots of block options, a good balance of grind and payoff, a very nice atmosphere in general.  An open-world multiplayer sandbox without zombies (I'm sick of zombies).  Creative mode for us architect-y types with a drag-fill option for blocks and free crafting.  Easy-to-use terrain tool in creative mode, it's fun and easy just to manipulate the terrain and build entire mountains, or dig huge caverns with just a few clicks.  Uses photo-realism textures, but manages to utilize them without them feeling janky or disjointed or immersion-breaking.  Dev team is responsive and seems to have a handle on all the bugs present and manages to either fix or create a workaround in a relatively quick fashion (7 Days to Die could learn a few things).  Reasonable cost.\n\nCons: Still early access, so who knows, but development has been relatively slow (I hesitate to put this in here, as I don't count it against the game, but it's worth stating to anyone expecting the Early Access title to imply it'll update rapidly).  The menu could use some help in polish and visuals, and there are still some features that are missing, leaving placeholders here and there.  No character customization yet; everyone is a bald monk in a gray tunic, and pronouns default male on server notifications.  Water is not in the game yet (but is in works, as shown by recent dev snapshots).\n\nI do love this game, a heck of a lot.  It's still in the works, and has been for quite a while, but even in its current state there are hours and hours to be gotten out of it.  It's most apt as a building game, has a great balance between the modern and the archaic, and satisfies a wish I've had for a very long time for something like Minecraft, but more immersive and realistic.  It's not going to satisfy the gamers that want the survival mechanic to last them forever in their run of the game, but there is enough here to at least serve as escapism to those of us that are sad that the world's borders are already drawn and its wildernesses all behind fences.","May 3","true","90.4"," 45 of 49 people (92%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","92","45","49","3","0"

The game has good content and great potential so far, and I am looking forward to future patches/updates.\n\nFor some strange reason I find the game to be quite relaxing (SP so far anyway).....I don't know if it is the music, the lack of enemies, or both, but I enjoy the exploration and crafting aspects of the game, and it will be even better with the addition of biomes to mix up the exploration more.  You do have to be a bit aware and careful of running into bears, as that is when the relaxation of the game is temporarily taken over by some intensity.   ;-)\n\nOnce you get somewhat establish, you can make your first crafting station, and then as you gather more resources (wood, ore, etc.) via exploring, you're then able to craft higher tiered workstations that open up more items to craft.  The amount of different things you can craft is pretty amazing so far, especially for an EA game, and it gives you a really good sense of how you can run wild with your imagination crafting things.  With the plethora of items you can currently craft, I’d like to find a server where people are cooperatively building towns and cities.

My 3 year old watched the whole time and enjoyed every minute of it, in fact she had me put up a poster with her face on it (awesome custom feature) in my first little shack. I still have about 3 hours to go before I lay the first stone (more flattening & grass cutting) but I am already loving the game's comfiness. The graphics add to this (sun rays!) and the music at the beginning set a great tone to that as well. Minecraft is an obvious inspiration, but things like customization of certain blocks within the game (as opposed to external mods in Minecraft) and the manipulation of the environment make this game stand out.\n\nWarning: Java makes it a sonofa♥♥♥♥♥ to get going and you will have issues, but the devs are very prompt and active on Steam forums to assist. It also has console commands to help you with the few potential bugs, such as a flymode since you can fall through the floor (for reference, it happened to me only one time in 6.5 hours of play).","December 10, 2014","true","27.5"," 68 of 88 people (77%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","77","68","88","3","6"

One can choose a survival or creative oriented approach to the game. Whichever you choose, you can build a base, hunt for food, and explore a vast, procedurally-generated world populated by different animals, plants, and biomes.\n\nSingleplayer and multiplayer options exist, where you can play with friends on servers or by LAN connection.\n\nAccess to creative mode can shorten building time if you are mostly interested in building things. Creative mode is entirely available in singleplayer mode. However, it may be limited or deactivated on some multiplayer servers.\n\nIn survival, you experience the added challenge of getting adequate nutrition and fending off hostile animals. Craft the necessary tools and design a farm for easy gathering. If the nomad life seems the more suitable one, craft a weapon and go hunting.\n\nThe amount of wildlife available, while diverse, is admittedly limited. A handful of predators exist to make life a little difficult, but they are relatively easy to dispatch with a heavy weapon at hand. Some animals only attack if provoked, so be careful blindly swinging weapons and tools. Only a few animals currently drop items when killed, but this will likely change in pending updates.\n\nCrafting and building are the predominant theme of the game. Raw resources are essential to the building process, so expect to spend a fair bit of harvesting stone, ores, and timber prior to building (unless you use creative mode).\n\nRealistic graphics are a lucrative feature of the game. Many of the craftable items have particular textures and designs. One could feasibly spend most of the time just building since there are essentially no limits to what one can build. However, this can also be monotonous if you are looking for a wider range of activities.\n\nPVP servers exist, but they are relatively barren. That aside, the weapons available are effective and fun to use. They are medieval pieces and offer a flair of knight-like combat. The morningstar is the most powerful weapon available and the most bad*ss. Unfortunately, not many weapons exist, and combat is limited to close range melee fights. This will likely change in the future, but, for now, there are only so many ways of scewering your adversaries.\n\nAll in all, Rising World is an addictive game. It has a polished and irresistible appearance uncharacteristic of most early access games. Most of the downsides are rather minute in scale and are usually addressed speedily by an otherwise small development team. I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys this genre.","February 28","true","950.5"," 46 of 53 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","46","53","0","0"

When Minecraft first came out, we all wondered what this might look like if it wasn't made up of blocks. Today, we see dozens of sandbox survival games attempting to re-create Minecraft in their own style. So, I was skeptical when I was gifted this title that it would just be more of the same. However, Rising World develivered!\n\nhttp://youtu.be/lIkSg-GWqEA\n\nI made a quick "Getting Started" video to help newbies get into Rising World, and to help skeptics understand just what they're in for.

Personally right now we tend to lean to playing it more than either 7 Days or Minecraft though overall we still prefer both of the others.  That said I think this game has a TON of fun potential.  Does it do anything overly unique from other similar surival, crafting, open world games?  Not really.  But what it does do it does well.   The grass is a bit annoying however you get used to it and after you learn to clear it off it is not that bad.   Over all the fact that you can add a ton of extra personal content and really customize your worlds makes this game even more the unqiue game.

If playing bug hunt isn't your idea of fun, or you don't like unfinished titles, please move on and revisit Rising World after it is completed. Otherwise, stick around for the notes.\n\n=========================================\nTL:DR Edition: As of 0.6.2 Alpha, game is pretty stable. Decent amount of in-game objects to work with, so crafting is good. Mobs consist of passive animals with rudimentary AI. Definitely worth checking out if sandbox builders are your bag. Check back later if you’re a fighter or explorer type.\n=========================================\n\nFirst off, if anyone has ever played Blockscape, this is what that game could have been. (HEAR THAT JENS!)\n\nThis review is of the 0.6.2 ALPHA version of the game. I will probably revisit it at a later point in the game's development. So let's see what it does and how well it does it:\n\nSandbox Building - It appears that this is the set of game mechanics that the devs focused on initially. I have to say it's pretty solid for an alpha state. The object library has an extensive list of blocks and objects to pull from. The combination of snap-to-grid and free floating positioning is great. If you know Minecraft, you can quickly get in and start building things. The interface and controls can be pretty awkward to use at time.\nTutorial - At this point, I think it's a stub for things to come. The tutorial is a few pages in the Journal, and doesn't really explain much other than basic survival. Use the guides in Steam to learn how to play the game.\nMobs - Still a stub. Only mobs are animals. AI is very basic and doesn't do anything unless you attack them. Bears will still mess you up. (Maybe OP)\nGraphics - Graphics are great. Textures are awesome. World generation makes interesting landscapes that can be deadly if you're running. From a distance, trees can look like paper cut outs at times. Biomes are coming (maybe this month). No water yet, either.\nSurvival - Three basic weapons and no armor yet. Can sleep to skip night cycle, and bed option is available almost immediately. Can grow and eat a variety of foods, but can only cook bacon and steak. No night time dangers yet, other than running into a bear or a pit. No weather or temps to deal with, either. Many stubs here to flesh out.\nDev Support - Devs are very active in the forums. Website as a list of objectives they want to include in the game, but could do a lot more in the way of project management. The website doesn't list what the planned order for features and what bugs they're working on. (Not a fan of Trello's site for use in game development, but it does this basic task well.)\nOnline Play - Game has it, but I didn't try it out.\nMy recommendationsIf you are a builder: Get this game. The building system is miles beyond what Minecraft can do, and it just looks more awesome.\nIf you are not a builder: Put this on your wish list and wait for a few updates to pass. Exploration is neat for about an hour or two, and then it gets boring. No pregenerated structures outside of landscapes and caves. Biomes update will help to fix this, but will need a lot more to keep it interesting for explorers. PvP and PvE people may also wish to wait for more objects (including armor), AI updates, Mobs, etc. But bears will still mess you up.\n","November 28, 2015","true","99.4"," 50 of 63 people (79%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","79","50","63","10","2"

It's got a long way to go, but it's great. Being built from the ground up, everything fits well and runs smoothly. It's got a little something for everyone. You can rough it out in an medievil castle or build a modern home.\n\nFarm your own food, plant crops and hunt animals. Animals.. The animals on this game are pretty damn cool. I started playing without realising how many animals there actually are. One afternoon I ran east for about 5km.. And i found myself in the african wilderness with Elephants, Rhynos and Giraffes...

An epic voxel based sandbox game.\npeoples may ask why this game would be so epic, and come with comments like "isnt this just another terriblie remake of minecraft"?\n\nwell the answere is NO.\n\nThis game indeed has inspiration by minecraft, but again theres a whole lot more to this game than you may think.\nAs i said this game is a voxel game just  like minecraft wich means that the game is buildt up by cubes. And what i just said is not theoretically and scientificly corect, but i am just going to say that so you understand what i am talking about. an better explaination can be found in wikipedia.\n\nHowever, what is it really that makes this unrealistic pixelized game as good as it is and how is it possiblie that a game that most peoples would call a minecraft remake could be a good game? well i am going to tell you that.\n\n"The thing" about Rising World is that in this game you are more "free" and have a lot more options to how you can build whatever you're gonna build. yes you can build your house with blocks as in minecraft if you like, but in this game the material isnt blocks by standard. in this game you have to manually craft the blocks from different material wich can be mined in same way as in minecraft. when you cut down your first tree you will see that it drops a wood log as a raw material, with this wood log you can create planks and supporting beams for a "realistic house" and floor/wall panel like you would do in real life. Or if you want to you can craft an wood "block" instead.\n\nThe developers of this game have been focusing a lot on the subject "Realism" when you cut down the wood, they dont break in blocks, they break in logs, if you mine some ore they dont drop like  blocks they drop like rocks in real life. Honestly this is actually a really awesome looking in game, the way the grass and everything is made is in so high quality that you wouldnt even belive it.\n\nThis game is based on the same subject as Minecraft wich is survival and building. As it is right now, the game is still in the early stage of development wich makes it a little bit dull right now if you want some action, but there will be coming hostile envoirment into the game really soon, and when i talk about hostile envoirment i mean hostile-wild animals like wolves and so on that can attack you. I am currently not sure what type of animals that will be added as hostile but i just used "wolf" as an example.\n\nThe game has two game modes to play: single player and multiplayer.\n\nthe single player part is pretty basic as i described above, mine, craft, survive, build\nBut the multiplayer part has PVP. Wich means that in game you will be able to find other peoples and choose wether you want to become their friends or their enemies, and if you choose enemies... well i guess you can imagine what happens next. FIGHT FOR YOUR LIFE WITH WHATEVER WEAPON YOU GOT!\n\nIn this game i have experienced a bit troubles when it comes to the online servers. for some reason i get this issue with getting disconnected every 30 minutes wich is really annoying but im sure the devs will sort this out pretty quick,\nIn the  first sentence of this review i wrote about piano. and you may wonder "what the heck has playing piano with this game to do"?\n\nwell in this game you can craft a lot of furniture that can be used wich also includes a fully functional playable piano where you use your keyboard to play different "buttons" on the piano.\nand honestly i find this quite fun specially when im getting aplauded while playing "chis medina - what are words "\nlive for peoples on the server.\n\nas furniture you have a lot of things to choose from, or more corectly said. hundreds of stuff!\namong theese you god atleast 8 different doors, book shelves, lamps, chairs, tables and so on. everything from medieval style to modern style furniture.\n\nIn the end this game is a beautiful masterpiece of a game totally worth to check out.\n\nso let your imagination free and go and build an masterpiece!\n\n\ni will give this game an 9.5/10 points because of some lack of content but this is as i said resulted by early stage of development.\nbut yet i highly recommend this game to any voxel lovers or gamers who likes to use their creativity.\n\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ar20O_YzzeI&feature=youtu.be","February 12, 2015","true","16.5"," 125 of 190 people (66%) found this review helpful 26 people found this review funny","66","125","190","26","6"

I went into Rising World thinking it was going to be just another Minecraft clone like the disappointing Castle Miner z, but I was really surprised how well this game plays. Rising World is in alpha and is still missing a lot of the polish and features, but that being said Rising World as so much potential. Rising World’s terrain is not block/cube based, and the blocks used for creating building/ect are much more varied which allows for much more creativity. (Block, cylinder, half cylinder, stairs type 1/2, ramp, ramp corner, and ramp inner corner) Along with all the different block shapes that game has tons of other cool items: Poster (used to upload a custom image to the game), trashcans, ladders, and different weapons/tools. Even whilst being in alpha, Rising World gives you so much to do, and it isn’t anywhere near what it’s going to be. I am very excited to see where Rising World goes is in the future.\n\nPros\nShows tons of promise\nNon-blocky terrain\nRegular updates\nBetter graphics compared to other voxel based games\nTons of blocks\nMany block variants\nWell-made multiplayer\nSimple building\n\n\nCons\n*** This game is in alpha.

The terrain is not blocky like Minecraft and this is going to be a huge upside for a lot of people, but Rising World has a long way to go before it can compete with larger voxel based games. If you’re willing to wait awhile for it to be finished, Rising World shows tons of potential and it’s absolutely worth getting into now.\n\n-HiPFiRED\n\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group\n\nCheck out the Original Network Groups.

Right now.. It seems Slower, not as intuitive, it makes you work more than Minecraft. The harvest times are longer.  Then you have to make your blocks... And good luck finding Iron which everything hinges on. My lord.  I finally had to make a creative world and cheat by typing "Item ironingot 64" to even get the ability to make a rake to flatten the ground out a bit.   That being said.  Making the blocks.. there is WAYYY more variety and choices than mincraft.  a basic stone can be made into nearly anything same with the wood.  Lots of textures and way pretty.  But as far as playability...

I find it very pleasing to be able to interact with everything. There is a lot of room for improvement and some I've noted:\n\n-Animals should react instead of just standing doing nothing.\n-UI should totally change, having a nice and smooth UI with good quality attracts players.\n-The animation of chopping/mining should be smoother and more realistic. It kinda looks like a tool swinging in the air.\n-When I build a shelter and I mine and destroy the ground under it, it just stays in the air. It should be fixed to either be destroyed or fall down.\n-Third Person View would be nice.\n-Push to talk (in-game voice chat).\n-A little notification when you pick stuff up when you mine or chop.\n-Crouching is absolutely useless, it just feels like I am bending my knee a little. The character should crouch more than 50cm.\n-Now concerning furnaces it is fine the way it is, but it should be a little bit more realistic by having to fuel it (With a bar or something to know when it'll run out). I also suggest adding a temperature counter so that certain ores can be melted at a certain degree.\n-Walking/running up a steep way feels like gliding.\n-Sometimes when I jump at a round wall it climbs it, as if I am walking up a hill rather than actually jumping.\n\nThat's the things I think should be added/improved, which some are totally based on opinion and play style.","January 29","true","1.3"," 32 of 40 people (80%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","80","32","40","4","1"

The  game is relaxing, and even though there are a limited amount of things you can do in the game it is still entertaining. You can explore the wolrd, cave systems, find a spot you might want to set up a homestead and start working on making your first building. You need to fuflfill your thirst and hunger needs, so farming is a must.

Logged in and immediately felt like the game was a bit dated, despite the changes.  The very first thing that bothered me was the speed of movement - too slow, and not smooth enough.  The lack of speed also translated into the actions you were taking, i.e. chopping down a tree, mining, etc.  On top of that, the animations just don't "feel" right for those actions.\n\nTo be sure, what IS there is interesting, so hopefully I'll be changing this review as things progress.\n----\n\nRealize that the game is bare bones right now with many features missing, so unless you simply like buying early access games, wait on this title.\n\nBefore I get into what's needed/missing, I'll go over what it has going for it:\n\n1) Looks better than most voxel games of this type - textures such as wood, stone, etc.\n2) The types of items you can craft seem to indicate that the finished product will have quite a range of craftable items\n3) The animals look good\n4) Building structures is easy - like the ability to lay down a string of blocks by left-clicking and holding\n\nWith that said, the game has a lot of potential assuming a few things happen:\n\n1) Walking speed is too slow, it just seems to drag\n2) Have to add in the other resources as soon as possible\n3) Better animations for player actions\n4) Hopefully instead of just "making" a piano in one shot, the crafting system will have a bit more complexity and you'll be required to first craft the components and then assemble them - and not just for the piano...\n5) Fix the issue where animals can walk over open spaces that the character can't\n6) The price seems a bit high for what there is currently (so only for those really wanting to support the dev on such an early project)\n\nAssuming those were the only things fixed/done, the game would be much more enjoyable, but hopefully there will be some true mobs added - even if they were just aggressive animals.","December 22, 2014","false","1.9"," 66 of 106 people (62%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","62","66","106","4","1"

The game has a more realistic feel with the voxels as instead of cubes you dig somewhat normally, it's hard to explain but just know it isn't a blocky game although you can create blocks using materials you have dug up.\n\n---Gameplay---\nThe gameplay doesn't entirely differ from games like 'Minecraft' but has it's own unique takes on how it plays, such as the fact the game takes things such as toilets and puts them in the game to create a very life like feel to it and it works very well. The game is smooth and fun to play and will definately give you a lot of enjoyment even if you have played voxel games for years and may be a bit tired of them. The game features multiplayer but a lot of fun can be had in singleplayer. I'm not sure if the server list doesn't work or that there aren't any servers but either way the game on launch features online multiplayer which is amazing for an EA game.\n\n---Crafting---\nThe game uses a drop down menu of different catagories which differs for the type of workbench you are using such as a normal workbench will allow you to create weapons and other basic things whereas a block workbench will allow you to create blocks. Without a workbench you can only create very basic things such as a basic sleeping tent, torch and some resources.\n\n---Bugs---\nCurrently there are a low amount of bugs, atleast I haven't really come across any, the only ones I have found is a floating cow and glitching through the terrain and on my first playthrough a few minutes in I found this bug and I fell for quite a while till I found *SPOILER* ...Hell...Yes Hell is in this game, I'm not sure how far down but it's pretty far.\n\n---Conclusion---\nOverall this game is very fun and well created and has a tonne of potential and I can't wait to see what this develops into. I give this game an 8.5 for being fun, unique and very interesting!\n\n---YouTube Video---\nhttp://youtu.be/ZQm7Aeg7ylw","December 3, 2014","true","1.2"," 54 of 85 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","54","85","0","12"

It feels very similar to Minecraft, however, the world isn't as restricted to the voxel grid, and the landscapes look much more natural. The game is still in Alpha, so the gameplay does feel a little limited, however, the developer has been constantly working on updates and it looks like a very promising game.\n\nRising World focuses on exploration, building structures (in a way very similar to Minecraft), hunting animals, farming, and traveling into caves to find rare ore to use in building.\n\nThe graphics are beautiful, particularly the lighting, but not so elaborate were it'd require a hardcore computer to run it. The interface and controls are very minimal, which is nice, but can feel a little unintuitive and confusing at times.","August 31, 2015","true","16.5"," 21 of 27 people (78%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","78","21","27","3","0"

Sure, there's more I can do, such as built gorgeous structures, but for now I've played through all the games implemented mechanics.\n\nTo put it simply, this is another crafting game similar but not exactly like minecraft. While there are blocks, there are also many different shapes to build with, and the entire terrain is smooth and bumpy.\n\nMy first few minutes were rather confused. I had a pickaxe, a wood axe, and I was placed in the middle of a forest it seemed. My first instinct was to cut down some trees. A few seconds later, I watched as the tree didn't just fall into a pile of wood, or only gave me the piece of tree I was chopping, but rather actually cracked and fell over like a real tree, leaving a stump. (of which you can also chop for wood)\n\nIt was then I quickly found the crafting menu, and saw a few things I could make from the new wood I got, including a crafting bench. I was assuming with this bench I could craft things not available in my standard inventory, so I made one and placed it.\n\nIt's at this point you'd probably see that there is a long list of items that require no materials to make. That's because, this being an Early Access game and essentially a paid demo, the developer decided rather than excluding these fully fuctional items just because there's no recipe yet, you can instead access them to test and use. It's a welcome change from developers instead hiding these kinds of things from us. Sure, it adds no difficulty or depth to the crafting, but that's not the point right now.\nYou'll also notice you can make a "block bench", of which I did and placed it. It was here I finally found what I could do with all that wood. There are a TON of different blocks in this game right now. They're all pretty much functionally the same, but there are so many different textures to choose from. You can pretty much make any type of house or building you can imagine with many different types of wood, stone, concrete, tiles, metals, and even scraps. It really adds a massive sense of variety to the building in this game, something games like Minecraft were lacking for a very long time.\n\nAgain though, since the only two resources available in the game right now are wood from trees and stone/iron from mountains, you can pretty much craft and block with ease.\n\nAside from that there are multiple different light sources to craft such as torches, lamps, flashlights, spotlights; and a couple different weapons and tools like a pickaxe, woodaxe, broad sword, all at really no cost right now.\n\nAnd that's it. There is a basic multiplayer mode with servers, and the animals in game are really just there for atmosphere since you don't need to eat yet and they don't provide anything when killed. There are no enemies except other players I guess, and there's absolutely no urgency. This is pretty much VERY Early Access, where the game is just barely functional with little to no content. Sure, there is a LOT to craft (even furniture and a WORKING PIANO) but really there's not much to hold your attention unless all you like to do is craft with no danger or cost at all.\n\nWhen this game starts to develop more and add more content, I'm sure this will easily be one of the better Minecraft replacements you can get. There are a couple other crafting games that already show some great promise as well, but this is the one I decided one right now, so hopefully it will continue to be worked on and supported until it is done.","December 23, 2014","true","1.1"," 44 of 71 people (62%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","62","44","71","4","0"

It is heavily inspired by Minecraft.\nAt this moment the game is more of a crafting and exploration game. The survival aspect of the game is minimal. If you have a stock of watermelon you're going to be fine as long as you don't forget to eat. The watermelon is also refilling your level of thirst. If you find pigs or cows, try to kill them and you have a bunch of meat to eat as well (cook it first tho).\n\nWhat can you do in this game?\nWell a couple of things.\n- Building / Crafting\n- Exploration\n- Farming materials and food\n\nExploration is not that exciting yet. You encounter different animals which are not hostile yet. While exploring you can (if you allow them) encounter caves as well. Those caves can be a hole in the ground or a entrance in a mountain. Most of the caves have different shafts going all kind of places. If you take a lot of torches and torch holders with you, you're able to explore the whole cave without waling in the dark (which is not a good idea anyway).\nThe caves have a creepy feeling because it's pitch dark in there if you have no torches or flashlight.\n\nWhile you're in a cave you should farm for ores and stone. I explored a cave where I had to walk back and forth between my camp and the cave several times. After completely exploring the cave I had enough stone and iron ore to build myself a little farmhouse (two stories) with a fireplace and a separate workshop. I only needed to head out for wood.\n\nFarming materials and food is easy. I still have some items that have no purpose in the game yet, but those are stored away. Trees are all over the place, so wood is easy to come by. Food is also easy to find. Watermelons are growing everywhere, don't forget to look up mountains as well! Then you still have the tomatoes and carrots which you can grow yourself on a plot of farmland as well. Although the tomatoes and carrots are harder to spot because of the high grass, you come across them more often if you know how they look like.\n\nBuilding or crafting is fun and easy. I like crafting games, especially if they are combined with survival and freedom. Like I said, this game is inspired by Minecraft. The building principle is the same as Minecraft. Crafting your materials needs to be done by the crafting menu which are accessed by crafting tables. Different tables for different things.\nYou can craft a lot of things which gives you a lot of different styles for i.e. buildings.\nOres are melted down to ingots and then made into plates and rods. It's a lot more than just picking a item and craft it. So in my second world I started gathering materials for all the crafting stations so I could build the house and other stuff.\n\nNow, like I said this is an early access review. Although I think the game is already a lot of fun, it has some issues as well.\nYou can for example fall through the ground. I had it once while mining for ore. The F2 key helps in this case (no clipping mode).\nIf you attack some animals (like bears) they attack back. If you respawn they are still mad at you, so don't attack them near your respawn point.\nThe game is easy on survival mode!\nThe only seeds you can plant are tomatoes and carrots. Watermelons and pumpkins has to be found.\nAnimals can float in the air or run into mountains.\n\nThese are some minor bugs and are not affecting the gameplay.\nThe game is still in development and the dev team is active. So if you like it, support them by buying the game. You won't regret it. :)","July 19, 2015","true","43.5"," 17 of 22 people (77%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","77","17","22","3","0"

It's still pretty limited, not a whole lot to offer outside of creating & building . There are animals, only some have something to offer for dinner, the others have nothing to offer.\n\nCooking: Can burn your food. Wanna live as a vegetarian, you can live off of fruits of the earth :)\n\nAs of May 2015, they've added mining material to the caves with the ability to smelt it down, and not long ago they added the ability to grow crops. Tomatoes, carrots. I believe there's one more but I don't recall without looking it up.\n\nOverall, as of 5/29/2015, I still enjoy the game, building and creating (which is what it mostly is right now, though there is a few online servers for MP if I recall correctly.  I also believe you can connect directly to another person's PC and co-op with them at home.\n\nDepending on your settings, some animals can be aggressive, creating a need for survival.\n\nThere are a variety of things you can build. A castle, a small house, a tent with a fire pit. A city even.. There are many images online and screenshots here in STEAM that are amazing.\n\nI would rate the game 8/10 right now as it's still in progress.","March 16, 2015","true","57.6"," 20 of 28 people (71%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","71","20","28","5","0"

First off let me just say that this is not a Minecraft clone at all. You build with blocks but thats about it. The world it self is actually smooth and wonderful. My first hour in this game was making myself a small cave to call home. Although there are naturally generating caves, I could not find one at the time. Once I had made myself a small shelter, a workbench, and a blockbench I went to find some flat ground for my house. Once I found flat ground I was suprised by how good the savanah/plains biome looked. I then began chopping trees (Which is fun since the tree's have physics). I then built myself a shack with some crafting tools in it(workbench, sawmill  and a blockbench) I then hunted some animals and found some iron to make a grill. I then cooked those animals and ate them. After that I walked alongside a mountain and fell through the world. That is one thing you need to be careful about, taking your valuables with you. Only take what you absolutely need. Being that it is in early alpha, it is understandable that bugs like this occur, but they still need to be fixed asap. So I then started a new world since I couldn't find my tool shed by my fire next to my depressingly small mine. I tried out the surreal world generator and I couldn't do much on it. It is a really cool idea, and I'm sure if you got a good seed with lots of trees nearby you could start a good world on it, but I wasn't very lucky. So I then started a new world on normal generation and spawned inside of a pine forest next to a plains biome. The pine forest looked even better that the first plains biome I came across, and I found a cave, inside of it was some iron, unfortunately not enough to do anything it with though. So seven hours later I finished building my house, I also fell through the world a few times too. (seriously fix that) All and all though this game is really good. Ive only crashed once so its fairly stable, and it already has a lot of content for being this new. So you better buy it, JUST DO IT!","September 12, 2015","true","11.4"," 23 of 34 people (68%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","68","23","34","3","0"

I'm not a great builder but I like to gather, mine, hoard, craft, farm and attempt to build. I love to explore also, but not if I'm worried about what's around every dark corner at any given time. So yes I've turned off the hostile animals (you can chose which to turn off individually) for the world I'm currently playing in. I am not sure you can outrun every thing when you first spawn and are not prepared to fight. With the crafting system I don't think you really can be prepared for some in game days in either case. I know you can outrun the bear..\nI will say that if this game is purchased I think people should be prepared to start a new world with updates and to me that is understandable.\n\nI only have 12 hours in (playing for 2 days with all my downtime in the game).","January 17","true","95.5"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

The amount of creativity and customization you can add to your building projects is amazing. In Rising world you are able to resize, turn and flip many objects, which blows the standard block building style away.  I have had this game for less than 2 weeks and have almost 40 hours on it.  The last time I played a game this much was probably Minecraft.  It may be because the building aspect of the game really interests me. As the game progresses through its various stages I hope they don't lose focus or attention to the building aspect of the game.  As I read through the list of things that the devs would like to add through out the games lifespan... I feel like the game could be a completely different game than it is right now.. But only time will tell. Afterall, it is just an early access game.\n\nIf you were the guy that spent hours and hours building buildings, random ideas, vehicles, boats, castles, pools on minecraft or any other building type of game. Check this game out. You will not be dissapointed.\n\n9/10- Overall (For what the game is now)\n\n","January 10, 2015","true","56.9"," 44 of 76 people (58%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","58","44","76","12","0"

As a creative contruction style of game it has great possibilities.  At heart I am very much a creative builder. I enjoy space engineers for example.\n\nThe system that these guys have created can become quite fulfilling in this respect, as long as I am not forced to go down the path of 'survival mode' or have to ultimately 'defeat the zombies'.  I have enough conflict games already and look to this one for expressing peaceful creativity.  That is the base it is currently offering.  I find it a bit of a pity that I now have to go out searching for food  and have to eat regularly.  I actually died before I realized that a strange sound that I was hearing was a notice that I had begun starving, (i missed reading the update that said you now have to eat to survive).\n\nThere are many alpha glitches and bugs, as well as very little indication of what it is that you have to do to get started.  But, once you find your way it is quite good fun.  The graphics are excellent for a building game and it is quite easy to get underway with contructions.\n\nMy concerns apart from having required conflict introduced is the lack of an easy location map to find your way back home.  It is extremely easy to get lost while running around and not be able to find your home base again.  I have a home base somewhere in the world that I never found back and so I started a new one elsewhere.\n\nAnother concern is that the game is run over the net in Java and I am a bit uncomfortable the security of my computer as a result.  Note also that the agreement appears to make allowances for the maker to charge us in future for access to the game world.\n\nAs far as the game itself goes, this has the basis for a really excellent world building environment with neat graphics and the ability to be really creative.  I wait with interest to see haw it develops in the future.  If this game reaches its potential it could reach stardom for those of us who are creatively inspired builders.","February 10, 2015","true","210.9"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","77","10","13","2","0"

I Highly recommend this game for people who have played, and enjoyed the voxel-based video game, Minecraft. Rising World has more of a realistic concept of Minecraft. There is so much more to this game than there is in Minecraft. Nothing is block-like, exept "some" of the building blocks. As for the rest of the building blocks, you can change their shape to cone, cylinder, half-sphere, triangle, stairs, a steep-like triangle, useful for such as roofs. There are some I can't seem to put in words...\nyou can also change their type of wood(thats only for the wood). There are different kinds of materials these blocks(or shapes) can be changed to, Such as(im going in order. top to bottom)\n\n!. Stone\n2.Stonebricks\n3.Sandstone\n4.Cobblestone\n5.Loam(I don't really know what this is)\n6.Marble\n7.Woodblocks\n8.Woodplanks\n9.Stonetiles\n10.Asphalt\n11.Concrete\n12.Concreteplates\n13.Reinforced Concrete\n14.Plaster\n15.Tiles(like bathroom tiles)\n16.Marbletiles\n17.Copper\n18.Metal\n19.Metalplates\n20.Recycled metal\n21.Ornament tiles(very fancy and colorful blocks)\nThere are also wooden planks and wooden beems. These can be used in construction, and can not be most of the materials I have listed exept wood. They can be changed to various types. The best part is, they can be resized. You heard me, resized.\nWhen trees are cut down, they fall like they would in real-life, with realistic noise.\nGrills: The are three types: The Grill,  The Cooking Grill and The Smoker. You can put animal meat on the grate anywhere you want! I forgot to mention that the textures in the game are\nphoto-realistic. Meaning they look like they would in real-life. The photographer's name is Deon Hamilton AKA, yahgiggle on steam. Look at my list of friends. You'll see him. I also want to give thanks to Red51, the developer of this wonderful game! There is so much more to this game than I have listed! I can't list ALL the features. TIP: When resizing/moving objects, press F 2 on your keybord for help. Goodbye, and rise your world.

I've spent a good amount of money on Early Access games over the past 3+ years. I've made some good purchases (Rust, The Forest, The Long Dark, Empyrion -Galactic Survival) and some terrible purchases (Nether, Miscreated, The Dead Linger, Survival: Postapocalypse Now). I can confidently say that Rising World was one of the better EA purchases I've made. It's truly been a breath of fresh air and I have enjoyed playing it. It's a nice crafting/building game with some minor survival elements. It is definitely a nice change of pace from some of the KOS/Hack-filled survival games out there. There is just something to be said about a group of players building beautiful buildings and towns while being able to help one another out. The learning curve isn't too bad and crafting is generally pretty straightforward. The developers seem to be doing a respectable job with updates. I think the biggest challenge they face will be adding more content (shapes, blocks, equipment, clothing, character design, etc). This game is pretty good in its current state but what's exciting is the potential of this game moving forward. Overall I would give Rising World 7.5/10 and it has been worth (to me anyway) the $14.99 price tag.","October 26, 2015","true","69.9"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","71","12","17","3","1"

It was fun - but essentially a smooth-terrain version of Minecraft (minus the monsters and plus a couple of angry bears/goats).  The gameplay does still largely lean toward creating a world, rather than survival - but I feel that there is a fairly enjoyable balance!\nAs of the most recent update (0.6.4) different biomes have been added.  Although at the moment the transition between them seems a little abrupt - but I am assuming that small issue will be solved when they add water.  I am very much looking forwards to seeing how the developers go about doing this and what impact it might have on gameplay.  At the moment food is your primary source of fluid intake.  The idea of having to try and build some sort of water purification object seems like it could be quite an interesting starting point in the game!\nThere is a definite grind to finding resources to build stuff in this game, even with them set to high - but it is worth it (in my opinion) if you want to burn away a few hours!\nAlso for an early access game of this type - I have personally experienced very few bugs - and absolutely no game breaking ones so far! *touch wood*\nI will try to revisit this review from time to time to update it as the game develops. :)\n\nIn summary - if you want to build a world, possibly play with friends gathering resources and building yourself an epic castle/base/house on a game with above-par graphics, then the current state of this game is for you.\n\nPros:\n-Actively developed, communication and updates seem to be fairly frequent\n-Pretty lighting/overall visual appearance!\n-Lots of objects to build and resources to find\n-Great time-killer\n\nCons:\n-A little spartan on the survival front at the moment - but it fits this sort of game fairly well. *\n-I can never seem to cook meat!!  It always ends up burned! :P\n-Some minor glitches - like when I went back to loot my corpse and found the head floating quite comically above it.\n\n\n*I don't know if the devs will see this review - but a "hardcore survival" type setting would be fun alongside the standard game mode for the future where tools wear down with use and there is more of an emphasis on setting up a base quickly as well!","January 3","true","41.5"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","8","11","0","0"

One of my favourite reason a recomend this is because of the free choice you have.(For an example, you can chose to be a modern person or a medieval person or a mid 1855-1957 person) Rising World is so good it made my day game tasic! If you're reading this then I say buy this game beause I know you'll love but sadly at first its a bit hard but so quickly it becomes realy clear! These are the reasons I recomend it!\n1. This game gives you the choice of what to do.\n2. You can chose what time you want to be in.(Which I already told you above)\n3. The way you can costomize the terraine.(But I wouldn't say it's better than minecrafts world editor)\n4.The way how the forests and caves and hell looks so real.(But I haven't told you about hell yet)\n5. The way how chopping trees go throught real life progresses.(But a bit shorter)\n6. How there are so meny things to be.(For example, this will take a while, a flower collector, a hunter, a miner, an adventurer, a woods men, a builder a normal person or even a demolitionist)\nThose are my reasons but I still have more to talk about, so lets cut to the cheese. Although the lack of motion is put in I still like it. The graphics are great!(Besides the big pot belly characters and the heads the turn a whole circle) Rising world is a great name for this game because the world is sort of rising up in your hands.\nThat is way a recomend this great spectacular game!","December 23, 2014","true","13.5"," 56 of 103 people (54%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","54","56","103","8","0"

Visually gorgeous.\n\n-----\n\nVery hard to come up with much in the way of criticism for a game at such an early stage. A few things I will mention:\n\n1. Currently, hitboxes for combat do odd things sometimes (ie. allowing you to be hit through walls or terrain).\n2. Sometimes it feels like there need to be faster tools for doing a job (ie. felling trees, mining).\n3. There are some resources (such as some of the ores) that currently have no crafting associated to them.\n4. When you die, your corpse posture is strange (standing with arms straight out). Also, his head flies up 3 blocks and floats.\n5. Blueprints do not clear trees when placing buildings, so you can wind up with trees THROUGH your structure.\n6. #5 leads to a few strange happenings with regard to trees through other surfaces, once you chop them down.\n7. Lighting glitches with torches/wall lights from time to time.\n8. Unable to pick up cooking surfaces or ore smelter, unlike most crafting stations.\n\nMy suspicion is that all of these will be addressed before it ever makes it out of Beta, and I'm 99% sure that #2 and #3 will effectively take care of each other.","November 20, 2015","true","148.9"," 16 of 28 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","16","28","0","0"

If the developers continue to work on this game, it has potential to be a very popular sandbox game.\n\nPros:\n- The graphics exceeded expectations and are far better than Minecraft or any other sandbox game that I have seen.\n- You are able to interact with 99% of the game. You can harvest crops, open drawers and cupboards, sit on chairs, realistically operate furnaces and ovens, and more.\n- The crafting system is in-depth without being too tedious.\n\nCons:\n- Multiplayer\nI have found that the majority of servers are made in a different language, which makes it slightly more difficult to find my way around. There are very few players online most of the time, and that reduces the enjoyment of online servers considerably. However, should this game become more popular, I feel that this problem will solve itself.\n- Content\nOne aspect of Minecraft that defeats Rising World is the vast amount of items and content that it contains. While very diverse when it comes to block textures, the game leaves much to be desired in the way of items. There are only 3 weapons, and they are all melee. Bows and maybe even rifles would be helpful and much appreciated. Also, there is now character modification, which means no armor.\n- No Mass Inventory\nWhen in creative mode, you can fly, break blocks with nearly any tool very quickly, etc. However, there is no mass inventory which means you have to shell out mass amounts of blocks, even in creative, which can get tedious.\n- Terraforming\nWhile terraforming takes practice in any game, I am not fond of the setup in Rising World. It tends to get frustrating trying to modify the environment in just the way you want, without it taking forever.\n\nDespite the many cons, you have to remember the game is still in its beginning stages, and, as I said earlier, it is still a great sandbox game and I imagine that many of the cons will eventually be resolved by the developers.","May 23","true","27.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Sure, it does have some survival aspects, but the building aspect of it is what really intruiged me. You can build and resize many different blocks and wood boardings to build your base, you can choose from a variety of different textures for many of the blocks in the game, and most importantly you can rotate the part you are trying to place in all three planes and actually place it and have it work. There is also a grid feature where you can build with ease knowing that you won't place things incorrectly. With the resizing feature, the rotation feature, the grid feature, and a bit of imagination, you can go pretty far in building how your base wants to look.\n\nSome downsides include there being not much to do as of yet, some glitches, just the same generic things that an alpha game has.\n\nWith this said I would definately reccomend this game to anyone interested in the things I found most intersting about it, and is willing to support the development of this potential-filled game.\n\n","August 17, 2015","true","15.2"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","0"

I was able to spend a little over 7 hours in game but nothing to keep me interested in it for much longer.\n\n+Graphics and performance were pretty good for early access.\n+lots of building choices\n+HUGE potential\n\n-few wildlife and not much danger\n-no water (really not a huge deal but should probably be there at this point)\n-limited gameplay (as of right now)\n","February 9","true","8.5"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","8","13","0","0"

From the start the game takes advantage of the intuitive key mappings that Minecraft has introduced many people to but also many other games. The first thing you will think is realistic minecraft but the game has so much potential to be more than that.\n\nThe learning curve isn't bad when getting going. Checking out the controls is a good idea. Once you get the hang of moving, using tools and gathering you're pretty much all set to go. I found jumping wasn't great personally. I thought a little higher might be nice.\n\nThe fact that their is so much content and choice even though it's mostly aesthetic at the moment in the game, for a early access alpha game it's great. There's coutless different blocks, items, furniture etc. Some have recipes, some don't but they're all amazing and yet you can play with them none the less.\n\nThe big issues is if you have 2 graphics cards the game tends to only see one. In my case my chipset and not my actual card which would cause the game to crash. Most people found from my research they could force one card to run the game over another which fixed their problems, in my case it didn't work. I had to actually plug a 2nd monitor in and set it as my primary in order to force the game to run with that graphics card but then it was as easy as dragging the game to my laptop screen.\n\nAll in all it's a great game with lots of potential, oh and the support I got from their offical forums was great also. I say if you wanna support the game and it looks pretty interesting to you now then give this game a purchase because I promise you won't be disappointed.\n\n26/2/16 - Game still amazing, I found the game seems to detect my card and use it rather than the built-in graphics on my new laptop meaning my previous issue is no longer a problem on my new computer. Still recommend. Also been more changes since then. Many animals and biomes as well as farming, crafting, mining, survival vs creative mode. Hostile mobs and passive ones and there's still more content planned.","December 28, 2014","true","21.0"," 12 of 21 people (57%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","57","12","21","5","0"

The synopsis being that the survival mode is pretty bad, but creative is fantastic.\n\nIf you're looking into it and excited about the survial mode, don't do it. Honestly, the survival mode is lousy. I spent 45 minutes doing nothing but mining in caves and never found a single bit of iron ore which you need for vairous tools, like the scythe. Which you NEED. Why? The grass in this game is so inexplicably long you can't hardly tell what you're doing unless you cut it down. I can't tell you how many trees I lost after cutting them down and cutting them up because I couldn't see them in the grass. It doesn't add to the game in any way. Also, the lighting effects from torches when you're trying to mine in caves or at night time is a pain. They turn everything a nasty yellow tint where even if you do run across ores you wouldn't know it.\n\nHowever, if you are looking into this game for the creative mode (where you still have to deal with the stupid grass but can at least easily clear it) then I'd say go for it! The construction in this game is incredible and the amount of customization you have is just crazy. I've seen some insane screenshots of things people have made.","May 15","true","7.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The emphasis of the game is on creative construction.  And the possibilities are endless.  If you enjoy building (with a little surviving aspect) either by yourself or with some friends, this is definitely the game to go with.  Personally, I was searching for a building/survival game to play with some friends.  I read a lot of reviews, and did a ton of research for Steam games and non-steam games.  And this is the one I purchased.  I am glad I did.  Here is a quick list of why I believe this game is above all the others:\n- It is in Alpha stage and yet it is stable (no crashes)\n- It is in Alpha stage and there is a ton of content\n- It is in Alpha stage and the graphics are fluid\n- It is in Alpha stage and movement and UI are smooth\nThese 4 things listed here, tell me that those designing and building this game are doing a great job.  Not only that, but this also tells me that this game will be expanding in the comming months.  And it will be expanding in a stable way.\n\nOther reasons why this game is awesome;\n- it gives the player amazing control over placement and selection including color choices.\nThis is one thing that stands out with this game, I have played a few other building/survival games and this game, opens up so many more routes of creativity for the player.\n- the graphics are awesome\nFor me graphics are a big thing.  So when a modern open world game is less than 1gig total size, I usually don't touch it.  But the vids on this game looked so good, and then when i tried for myself, I was amazed.  The graphcis are simple.... BUT yet, detailed in an amazing way.  They have done an outstanding job, keeping things simple, user controllable AND amazing looking.\n- you CAN die\nThis was one of the first things I tested out.  How easy is it to die?  I found out that if you just build, you have nothing to worry about.  BUT if you want explore, and you come across a bear, you will die.  To me, that is a realistic game.  If I have to fight an angry grizzle bear, and all I have is an axe, I should lose.  AND because the game is still growing and developing, more and more animals are being added, both dangerous and skidish animals.  Perfect!!!\n\nIt is a beautiful game, that comes with my full recomendation.  JIW team is doing a great Job on this game, and from what I have seen of their work, I give them my full support.  I am excited to see this game develop and grow.\n\n","September 29, 2015","true","6.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Already in Alpha it it has more to offer creatively than minecraft does. It looks amazing and has really cool digging/building physics. And it doesn't seem to be just a refurbished 7 days to die clone, as it might seem to be at first. This game triumphs 7Days already, and the alpha was released on steam this week! JIW-Games are going to score big time on this for sure!\n\nPros:\n- Lots of building materials / items to create houses and destinct buildings.\n- Digging / mining is very intresting and makes caves super intresting to explore or dig yourself.\n- Terraforming is really well done, with minor improvements it could become the greatest creative tool for editing an allready stunning landscape\n- Uses seeds for random landscapes, just like minecraft, so you wont get boored by the same map every new game.\n- The developers really seems to take what the community recomends/suggests to heart, also being very active on the community forums.\n- REALLY lightweight, and performance is awesome, even for low-end PCs. Most computers would have no problem max'ing everything, very optimized!\n\nCons:\n- There are ofcourse minor bugs, as to be expected for a game in this state. I personally haven't run into any yet, atleast none that didn't correct after a sec.\n- Some things are missing from the game at this point, like metals, food and water. altho there is some animals NPCs, but they are useless as of now. But then again, you can still craft all metall items without resources, and food and drink does not deplete, so in this state of the game, it really doesn't matter.\n- The gamemodes didn't have all to much of an effect on the game, but again, this is expected to change at a later date.\n\nThere really isn't any cons for this game, as these issues will be worked out in the future.\n\nCONCLUSION:\nIt's an awsome game, and I have no problem recommending it! But beware at this state, it isn't really a survival game YET. But it WILL become this at a later date. It shows a metric ton of promise, and I'm certain that this will be the gateway for many people into the survival games.\nPlease support the developer and buy the game now, there isn't a doubt in my mind that this game will EXPLODE once released, and then you can feel good for actually supporting the development for an upcoming classic.","December 7, 2014","true","4.1"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","6","10","0","0"

So I am doing my part and telling everyone about this game.  On a rating of 1 to 10.  All thumbs up for a 10.  I can not wait for the next update which I am sure is going to make the game 100% better.  Which right now is really hard to do.","August 31, 2015","true","632.8"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","56","9","16","3","0"

It is a shame that this game is not in the spotline for good beta testers to help the developers getting this game to its perfect shape.\n\nThat being said, this game offers you everything minecraft can offer, just in a more modern setting and not blocky.\nA smooth and nice experiance even during earlie access.

Many people draw comparison to Minecraft, which is understandable.. Although I feel the crafting and building aspect is more like 7 Days to Die, since it's got a crafting menu not gridlike table, and it's using voxels for the world and not the classic blocks. The building however uses blocks, so you get the best of both worlds. You're not bound to blocks though as you can place stone and dirt however you want in a voxelbased way, allowing for more natural looking constructions and builds.\n\nThere's a lot of crafting stations to build, and with them comes tons of furniture and components you can build. Like windows, glass panes, doors, frames, plank boards, beams. There's many possible tools for you to be creative in this game, and I'm sure there's gonna be a lot of screenshots of nice things people build. For such an early game, it's got a lot of things to keep you busy from the get-go.\n\nThe game is a very early draft of the final product, of that I'm sure. But it's got heaps of potential, like so many other open worlds builders.. Let's just hope this one makes something from itself. Tough market for this type of game, since it's no longer a niche genre these days..\nI like it so far, and can see myself having a lot of fun with it once it get's more fleshed out. There are a few neat mechanics in this game, including a built in bukkit system (like Minecraft) in which you can chose which blocks or areas people can alter. Useful for preventing griefing and making sure things you've built stays unharmed. The feature isn't fully implemented yet I think, but I'm sure it'll be fully operational soon enough.\nThere's also a feature in which allows you to import image files directly into the game as "posters" that you can place all over the world (on walls, on the ground and roof). I can only imagine what potential that has :P\n\nAll in all, it's a neat little game and I do recommend it for people who want this. You know who you are ;)\nHard to give it a score so early on, but I can definitely approve it. Give it a try!","December 4, 2014","true","6.3"," 14 of 26 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","14","26","0","0"

The progress is disappointingly slow at times. rumor has it that this is due to rather small development team.  if they keep it up it will eventually be an incredible smooth-textured diversion that could very well become a 'minecraft killer'.  Though if progress slows much more, it will be difficult to convince anyone that it was an original idea upon conception, as there are similar games being made right now which could easily surpass the beta or final realease date. I do recommend this, and it is pretty and unique, however it does require patience at this point.","September 21, 2015","true","91.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The mine is a mess and the working area is a muddle of benches, for godness sake I'm still sleeping in a thatch hut, until later....hopefully\nSo what's been taking up 30 hours...It's the options, textures and the ability to maniplate building materials, re-sizing, changing angles,  360 degree rotation in 3 planes it's all there.\nThe developers have done an awsome job with whats already been included in the game and well worth the money spent. At the risk of under stating it, think of mine craft for grown ups or CAD (computer aided design) for people with imagination. Creating great designs is just so easy.\nThe game is not without flaws with some tearing and minor glitching but this easily forgivable, remember it's in development.\nI also have to thank the Rising World community for some great tips and instructional videos, check out "safety meeting"\n\nIF you like world builder games and you want to see how creative you can be this will keep you up all night.

Even in alpha.\n\nBeen called a Minecraft clone w/e let them, as this game take what minecraft offered and improves it vastly not just in graphics but in so many ways.\n\nBeen playing pretty regularly (looking forward each day after work) because it is still in early stages there are few annoying bugs, like getting froze, invisible (ninja) bears, smelter acting like they don't work, or blocks sometimes not vanishing as well as very little stuttering or falling through the ground.\n\nBut the few bugs you discover after playing for a longer period of time are a minor inconvenience and are worth ignore due to the fact this game RULES!! Of course because it is in alpha the developers are more than willing to accept suggestions so there is a plus behind that.\n\nIf you have ever built anything in Sims, Minecraft (and clones) or anything else and enjoyed it then you will become addicted to this game, as that is the majority of what you can do (but far better than either of the mentioned games)\n\nPlaying multiple player is by far better, as you can see others houses or come across and abandoned area and just hang out for a bit, leave little gifts (in my case random pictures on a plank of wood by their beds) so long as you stay in the lines of being respectful there has been no problems.\n\nIn multiple player you can have an admin of the server assign you an area, this is your home what you build cannot be destroyed/altered by other players, door can only be opened by you, chest can only be looted by you. This allows you to build how you want with no fear of other people. Also with some servers they use scripts to allow a little more free way for the players, such as food deliver, home teleport, save points and such.\n\nAnother plus is the fact this game allows use of the commands. In single player (or cheating multi player servers) you can add items. But the better commands allow you to "mark" your current location or "goto mark" to teleport back to that spot, as well as "goto #spawn" sending you back to your spawn points. As I'm still new these are the small commands I know.\n\nExploring has been a lot of fun, dig a path way to the center of the world come across a vast cave system explore to your heart content mining ore and stone, run a single direction and be put in awe by the sunset/sunrise you came across stopping you in your tracks. Run over the mountains falling into random caves and breaking your bones all this and so much more.\n\nFirst review of a game, first game that made me really want to.\nPlay this game, you will love it the community has been very friendly and it is just fun to explore this great (soon to be better) looking world. Currently logged in 25 hours and haven't even built a house yet, a small cave and just been loving the exploring and collecting.","October 8, 2015","true","45.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I've died twice for no reason and lost everything. Graphics aren't bad. Should be able to save the game or at lease respawn to where your base is. Would be good if you didn't lose your equipment after you have died.. This game does have a lot of potential and I'm sure that will show in later updates. Unfortunately the terrain is all too similar and boring (from what i've explored). I think a few rivers/lakes, buildings and scattered junk/debris could be added. Should be able to loot from dead animals and even have some animals attack, just to make it a bit more interesting.

I appreciate that this is part of minecrafts charm before i offend someone but might i digress. a good early access, plenty to do, most basic building and crafting systems are in place. Offering plenty to do for the coming months while updates are being implimented. No ores are yet in the game leaving just timber and stone, with the game giving you iron for free, to open up iron based crafting to get you by. this game has alot of potential! the devs just need to be careful with how they go, not overly replicating minecraft. aesthetically the game is very pretty, very good graphics and detail. the one shame is the mechanics of the tool actions seem a little limp wristed and not overly realistic. the need for dangerous wild animals. bear, wolves, crocs and snakes would help to add a to the survivor feel. meybe even add the dayz touch? as zombies would again add to the haste of shelter before dark! even if its just a couple of server mod. just a though! worth the £10 investment as is. and as the devs have hit the ground running im expecting a £30-40 game in a year or so!","January 11, 2015","true","4.0"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","56","5","9","5","0"

I played the heck out of 7DTD, from alpha 3 until 9 and loved every moment.  Taking some time off I decided to see what my nephew and 90% of the gaming channels on YouTube were abuzz about, Minecraft.  I think I played a total of 6 hours in creative and another 10 hours on a server.  I almost puked after each session.  The blurry textures (even with add on mods improving them) made it hard to look at.  Towel thrown in.  I stumbled upon this after researching Life is Fuedal and thought this could be a good alternative.  Then I saw on the front page it was ALPHA.  I have been burned by alpha games over the last year.  Between Rust, Nether (I know they are different from RW) and other games (looking at you Landmark) I have had my fair share of buyers remorse.  I decided to reach out to the Rising World community to ask a few questions.  Surprisingly the community was friendly and willing to answer questions respectfully.  Another nice surprise....the dev team responded to some of my questions as well and did so within minutes of posting the questions.\n\nReview: For Alpha 0.5.1.4\n\nGraphics:  8/10 Some weird glitches and tearing.  Character looks like Voldemort (as stated from another post).  There are already a HUGE library of tool, weapons, blocks and decor.\n\nSound: 5/10 Sounds like the outdoors.  Birds chirp and bugs buzz but there is no music.\n\nUI: 9/10 Very simple and spartan.  I was already used to controls and on screen commands in 5 minutes.\n\nStability: 7/10  I ran into a memory leak and crashed during my first play through.  After that no further issue.  There is some lag even with a fairly decent computer but it is alpha and engine will be tuned in the future.\n\nOverall:  8/10 I would recommend this game to anyone who wants to relax and just build.  This game is designed with gamers who find gaming to be relaxing and just want to use their imagination.  Add in future Workshop support, patches that are dropped every week or so, devs that respond quickly and servers that SO FAR are stable and you have a game that is a WINNER.","January 2, 2015","true","12.1"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","6","11","0","0"

It has attrative gameplay, nice graphic. However, it does not worth 15 bucks at  this state since only thing we can do is just collecting and building stuffs but you cant hunt or find food or drink. Also, there are a few annoying bugs but the dev team worked really hard to fix it. At this state its not a survival game actually at this moment ( 0.5.1.4 alpha).

That said, I like the odds on this one.  When I installed it, the Java download was frustrating; the latest patch fixed that issue.  As with any Early Access/Alpha, don't expect a smooth, shiny finished product.  This just came out last month, and had a holiday season to get through.\n\nAt the moment (1/3/15) the game is pretty much crafting and building.  Survival elements such as hunger and thirst are not yet implemented.  I have yet to even notice anything resembling a water source.  Raw materials are two basics: stone and wood.  If you're worried that means you can't make metal for tools, that is not so, it's just currently "free" to craft something that would usually be built from metal.\n\nThat being said, the range of block textures is amazing already.  You can select textures even for the wood on each of the workbenches.  I've been able to build paths by making a rake and just clearing grass to the dirt, just as I've also been levelling off areas for my buildings/base camp.\n\nIf you want a quick intro to familiarize yourself, this thread from the game's forums is an excellent start: https://forum.rising-world.net/index.php/Thread/12-First-steps/\n\nAll in all, I hope this can be a pleasant addition to the voxel/crafting genre that's been picking up, and I certainly recommend this game for its potential - at the very least this is one to keep an eye on.","January 2, 2015","true","104.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

I give this game a 9/10 for the following reasons.\n\nNow I've seen alot of bad reviews of this game and can't see why, the game is in very early stages. But that's what I like, the simplicity. For those who don't like that shouldn't be buying games in the Early Acess area of Steam, the people wanted the game and the devs wanted to release the game, enough said. But I'm going to say more, the game is just fun to play, in the last two days I've had the game I was able to create an amazing mine site sort of THING. It didn't take me weeks like some projects would with other building games, like MC. (Sorry MC I love you but... R-W is sooo much easier) Collecting resources is sooo easy, mainly because the game is not complete, or anywhere near complete.

So let's get down to some of what I've already discovered about this game - which as I write this is still in early access alpha stage.\n\n1. As I write this, the only resources you need to worry about collecting are logs and stone. Metal is presently freely available from the anvil, so you can do all of the building and construction you like without waiting for the ores to be implemented.\n\n2. Building... what a pleasure! Without describing all of the various wood, stone, marble and metal construction materials available, I will say that you have far greater ability to rotate many of your items and place items at various angles. You can use a grid and change the size of the grid for more precise placement, and your imagination is the only limit I've found. Check out some of the screenshots in the community forum.\n\nEdit: Having spent some time going through all of the different crafting stations I can now report there are currently 306 items available for crafting, and if you include all of the shape and colour variations it adds up to just over 2,000 combinations (plus you can upload your own pictures for additional decorations. Some items like the woodplanks can be rotated in three dimensions with 24 different settings for each. 15 degree rotation x 3 = 72 options for positions, though since front and back images are the same, realistically that is only (!) 36 positions. 45 of those 306 items are currently freely available to craft, but you'll need to gather logs and stone for the rest.\n\n3. Some special features. Some of the things I haven't seen in other games is the ability to use some of the items you create. Sitting at the table is somewhat expected, but playing actual tunes and chords on the piano was definitely surprising. You can shape the landscape by using tools like the rake and sledgehammer, and tree planting has just been introduced in the latest update.\n\nThe cons:\n\nSurvival at the present time is assured - providing you avoid falling in caves. The developers assure us that the game will include the normal issues to deal with such as hostiles, hunger, etc\n\nSome people have also reported some problems getting the game started, and this is nearly always due to their Java installations. If you have a 64bit OS, you probably only have a 32bit Java installed. You'll need to download and install the latest 64bit version, then I'd suggest you reboot your computer to start clean. There is a thread on the forums about how to resolve this if you are affected. It took me less than 10 minutes to sort it out myself, so as long as you are sensible and don't try messing around unnecessarily with the task manager you shouldn't have any trouble.\n\nIf you do have any issues though, the devs are around very regularly offering support and assistance - and when I say regularly I mean at least daily from what I've seen so far. There are a lot of happy Rising World purchasers in the community willing to help as well.\n\nThe TL;DR version - if you like building and shaping your environment, then you can do most of that now (still waiting on water). If you want to hunt monsters or farm, you may want to follow along for a bit and wait until they've been implemented.","December 28, 2014","true","93.2"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","4","8","0","0"

Obviously, that's why it's early access.  If you want something that's closer to a full game, I'd keep an eye on Rising World, but not buy it yet.\n\n\nThe Gameplay\nSimply put, there's not much here yet.  You can explore, chop down trees, collect plants, dig in to the earth, but that's about it.  So far, I've only found that you can make a crafting table to make more complex things down the road, and a simple shelter.  That's...about it.  Currently it also seems like there's no way to feed your character, but you can kill cows and whatnot.  A neat feature is that you can hide the body.  I'm sure the devs have it planned, but it's simply not in there yet.  It's gameplay is very simple, but it's bound to have a lot of things in the future.\n\nControls\nThe default controls are VERY confusing right now.  At least they add an option to rebind them.  It took a lot of pressing all sorts of buttons until I wisened up and checked the options.  There's a few no-brainers, for instance, I is inventory, WASD to move, L for light.  But then there's actually interacting with things, which is bound to F for some reason?  That one in particular bothers me.  But again, you can remap it to be however you want.\n\nGraphics\nWONDERFUL.  By far my favorite thing of the game so far!  It's quite a pretty game AND it hasn't had much lag!  I've only ever played the single player, and have no plans on playing multiplayer, but again, I was so surprised that it didn't slow down much at all on my crap computer with 5+ year old everything!  I hope that, as they add more features, this part of the game doesn't change.\n\nOverall, I give this game a thumbs up.  The devs are very active in the forums, and are doing their very best.  It feels like they've worked on some things in a backwards order(for instance, adding a trashcan, but no ability to get food yet?), but they're trying.  They're trying so hard, and are even willing to walk you through problems on steam chat so you don't have to constantly click back to the forums trying to figure something out in the hopes that a dev will see your forum post again.  It's still in development, and I'm looking forward to watching it grow, but keep in mind it's still in very early alpha and should not be considered a fully playable game yet.  You're funding the developers much like you would be on kickstarter.","January 4, 2015","true","17.9"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","4","8","0","0"

It runs very smoothly, full-screen now available.  Known hazards are falling through the world (rare unless you fly into the scenery), occasional freezing of game and failure to save some details (rare if you come out of the game and reload every couple of hours).\n\nResources are extremely limited at present (wood and stone) but there is an impressive array of building textures available and several pre-defined block shapes, and quite a few props.  RSI has been considered - tools will operate continuously, blocks can be crafted in quantity and built in continuous lines (horizontally but not vetically yet).  There is no facility to design your own building blocks and currently the rotation of blocks is restricted.  Crafting is easily mastered and instant - no tedious timers to wiat out.  Placing items on the other hand does have a timer - which gives you a chance to change your mind - useful because there are few items which can be reclaimed once placed.\n\nVisually the game is a pleasure, the wandering animals are lovely to look at although the only interaction presently available is you can kill them.  This can be done by accident as they will wander between your axe and the tree you are cutting and die in 2 hits.  The animals also have a tendency to sink into the scenery (there is a goat sunk to its shoulders in my kitchen garden plot and a deer with its front half stuck in my stone quarry wall).  I find the scenery lovely but repetitive, but possibly I have not explored far enough.\n\nExploring is always hazardous for me as I get lost very easily, but the craftable compass is easy to use and effective.   There are a range of craftable light sources but there is also a strong white light available on the L key which I find helpful because I have visual issues.  The player inventory looks well thought out and storage is addressed from the start of game with craftable chests.\n\nThe survival and adventure tags are not warranted for the game in its present form.  Injury and death are caused by falling damage and there is presently no health regen.  Apart from falling there appears to be no risk as yet.  Hunger and thirst icons exist but presently remain green.  Crops, food and survival demands are yet to come.\n\nI have tried a number of games of this genre (Minecraft, Fortress Craft Evovled, Starforge, Landmark) and IMO Rising World has the potential to become the most popular due to the realistic visuals and animation, user-friendly controls, crafting system and construction options already in place.  I look forward to the development of more varied resources, biomes, survival needs and adventure.","January 4, 2015","true","693.2"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","3","6","0","0"

Make sure your Java is as up-to-date as possible ( 25 I believe ) BEFORE launching. So far, I haven't been able to launch the Mac version. ( Late 2013 MacBook Pro 2.6Ghz i7 16gb Ram Running 10.10.1 ) either native or Windows 7 or 8 emulated. Nothing at all happens when I click "Play". I just up-dated my Java on my Windows box and so far I am getting an error that Rising World is running altho it appears not to be, but that "may be" a Steam thing. Next I guess I'll see if it runs on Lunix as advertised. I want to say good things and I have a feeling I will be able to once I do some restarting and up dating and such. I'm going to give it a thumbs down so it catches your eye and you can make the changes and up dates yourself before downloading this title. I am certainly sure that when I edit this post I'll change things in a positive direction. I REALLY want to because this game seems exciting and I sure do hope to find out! By all means get it because it looks to be VERY COOL but just make sure, as with anything, that your system - whatever it may be - is up to date. If it's not, well now you know what to expect. I mean no disrespect towards the developers with this thumbs down, and yes I do understand that this isn't a final release.\n\nHappy Holler-Daze\nCheers\nOy!\n\nEDIT: See that,....working swell now on Windows 7 after a restart. Looks BEAUTIFUL. I will follow up with a linux install ( once I can tear myself away from this game). Still a no go on Mac after a restart of the machine and Java update. Weird. Again, I'm sure it's a fixable issue.\n\nOver.\n\n\nFINAL EDIT: Excellent game. Still having issues with my 2013 MacBook and I will be using their forum going forward. Side note, the game ran great on my 2009 Mac Mini server. Linux ( as expected ) worked flawless. And as stated worked on my Windows box. No doubt that my Mac issue will get solved quickly.\n\nThat is why I have changed my recommendation from "no" to a great big "YES!!! With great support and an AMAZING looking game, it is a well deserved endorsement. It's early release Alpha, understand that there will be minor issues, additions, deletions and eventual changes and you'll be fine. I've fallen thru the world/ground a few times but thats OK,...it was pretty funny actually & I laughed! Don't get emotionally attached to items in your inventory should you croak. They go away. Thats because resurrection isn't FREE I bet ;-) and thats ok too - the game is that fun, I don't care & that may well change later in development.\n\nIf you grew up with 8-bit games thousands of years ago as my kids believe and couldn't understand what all the hype was over Minecraft - BUT liked the concept, you just wished Minecraft had awesome imagery ( not blocky ), this is what you've been looking & hoping for,...but better. Highly addictive, pleasing to the eye & fun to play. It's potential is outstanding. Its all ready outstanding and can only get better!\n\nTruly enjoyable.\n\nWishing the Dev's the best with Rising World, you can tell they've put their heart & soul into this game. It's well worth the money spent. I'm loving this game!\n\n-maxi","December 14, 2014","true","20.7"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","7","14","0","4"

I was expecting a generic Minecraft clone, but Rising World is an improvement over Minecraft, in many ways. Even at this early stage there are dozens of items and tools to craft (and right now some of them don't need materials, though I'm sure that will change). It's not revolutionary, but it's fun. Buy it if you like open-world exploration and survival.\n\nLike many of the negative reviews on here, I had a few problems involving Java when I first loaded this up, but I think I figured it out. To get Rising World to work, install it, completely exit out of Steam, go to Java's download page (https://www.java.com/en/) and just hit download. Not only will Java automatically determine which Java you need, but it'll download it lickety split so you don't have to spend hours researching your system specs to figure out which version works best for you. After I downloaded it, I exited out of the browser, pulled up Rising World, and it works just fine. I hope this precludes any potential Java issues.","December 31, 2014","true","1.6"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","7","14","0","0"

If you do buy it now, don't expect to much from it. This is because the game is really alpha! My biggest complaint with the game is the accuracy of mining. For instance, I was building a cave house out of the side of the mountain, but it was really hard to get the floor level. Also, in the near future, I hope to see at least a "lawn mower" item put into the game. With or without a recipe.

Will definately Like this... Yeah right now sometimes when it loads... weapons, tools and houses youve created sometimes are just black... But reloading the game sometimes fixes it... You have to take into account that it is in Alpha.. and just with what they allow right now.. this game has alot of potential. I cant wait to see what other animals they are going to add and what type of enemies, monsters, or feral animals they may add... Its gonna be a fun and exciting game. even though right now 13 bucks seems a bit much for where its at... but i would rather pay that now and help with development than may 20-40 later when its almost done... this game will be worth it. I recommend it. Some people may wanna wait but if your patient and wanna learn some of the game before the deadly things are added. its still fun with just where its at.","January 14, 2015","true","26.3"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","4","8","2","0"

There are many sandbox games out there inspired by Minecraft, but none of them really fulfil your needs if you're looking for a true Minecraft alternative. This is the real deal!\n\nConsidering the early stage, here are a few tips for the further development:\n- In-game tutorial / documentation (I don't like switching from wiki to game)\n- Less monotonous landscape generation (like biomes in minecraft maybe?)\n- More realistic mountain generation (feels like a roller-coaster at the moment)\n- As crafting posibilities increase, less resource-hungry crafting or spawn more resources\n- The amount of random resources will be insufficient when more resource hungy crafting pattern arrive\n- More survival elements in the environment (weather, wildlife, aura)\n- Pigs look more like a fat opera singer's bottom\n\nI'm very excited to see what the future will bring.

Rather than use a blocky system for everything, the game uses the polygon esque method seen in planet explorers, only perfects it! Caving in this game truly looks like you are manoeuvring a real cave, with the lighting effects being just spot on. Whilst it is an indie game it does many things right;\n\n1-The lighting i spot on, the torches you hold light up the immediate vicinity, whilst the torches are capable of piercing far away caves or just the night. The daylight also just looks beautiful, now bear in mind that i am using a laptop (running planet explorers at 13 fps) and on very high quality the game runs very nicely, even with all the light options turned on!\n\n2- The atmosphere of the game, i have owned this game for two days as of the time of writing, and i have been unable to put it down. The world feels alive, and even with no real dangerous mobs (apart from bears) i still feel twitchy going through caves. But the over world feels comfortable and just generally pleasant.\n\n3-Construction; one can stick to usual mc methods, yet the construction are capable of being so much more free formed, wooden planks are the best thing in any game, the ability to make a wooden house, defensive wall or just a toilet shack , makes this game truly unmissable.\n\nOverall, unlike other games which are buggy, rough gameplay or just unresponsive developers, this game is taking a step in the right direction in EVERY way. Food and water are important but not debilitating.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/deathcloset/recommended/324080/","deathcloset","Sugarbuzz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/deathcloset/","89 products in account","Early Access Review\n\ntl;dr A fresh and lovely take on the open world survival sandbox genre: buy it and enjoy!\n\nMain Review\nI love this game! Not the least for the developer(s) and the community.\n\nRising World is simple, engaging and rewarding without being boring, difficult or grindy. Somehow Rising World strikes this rare, perfect and seemingly contradictory balance - and it's a happy thing to experience.\n\nDespite its apparent simplicity, Rising World is simply beautiful. Wandering around the forests and hills is relaxing yet stimulating. The soundscape is peaceful and crisp.\n\nThe pace of gameplay seems perfect to me: not so fast as to be hectic yet not so slow as to be tedious. For example, I'll mine for a bit and find some copper. Cool! But I need iron. So I mine and mine some more and find some tungsten...OK, I will probably need this later...then I mine and mine some more, find coal, find more coal, and just when I start to feel like I'm never going to find iron, boom, I find a big old patch of it!\n\nThe atmosphere of the game is enchanting. I greatly enjoy using the rake to make trails and pathways from my house or my mine to the nearby forests. I like dotting the roads with torches. I love going out on these trails for hunting/gathering expeditions and chopping down some trees. To me the experience is just captivating yet serene.\n\nSo to further describe Rising World (RW) I'm going to make some comparisons and contrasts to Minecraft (MC) here - sorry but when all that you've had in your town is McDonald's it's the only thing you can use as comparison when you finally get an In-N-Out Burger or maybe it would be more accurate to call Rising World a KFC to Minecraft's McDonald's...but now I'm just making myself hungry, so here I go.\n\nThe sheer number and types of building blocks you can craft far outstrips vanilla MC, as does the ability to construct buildings. The building capabilities of RW seem closer to Second Life than to MC or other blocky builders - though far, far easier to handle than Second Life's. The buildings I've seen on multiplayer servers are awesome!...my own are...well, not quite as awesome, but they still are made of beautiful blocks! I especially like hollowing-out a cave from the side of a hill and making a cozy evil-boss lair. It's quite enjoyable.\n\nI haven't engaged in any PvP (it's not my bag), so I can't comment on that aspect. There isn't any real machinery or mechanics yet, but the developer will be adding electricity, wires and logic controllers in the future. The Mobs are very simple at this point: nothing magical (i.e., no zombies which is a rather nice and refreshing change). Just watch out for Tigers and Bears, oh my! And the creatures of the world don't seem to do much path finding, so you'll find you can escape predators by running to the far side of a hole in the ground. I fear the day the AI is updated.\n\nSo, speaking of updates, the development process is consistent and transparent. And the help and support on the forums is just great. I recently had a pretty annoying and weird problem that I caused, and when I brought it to their attention it was fixed within a few hours. Do you know how great that feels? :)\n\nGet Rising World.\n\nEven in its early access form it's just a nice, fun, excellently made game.","December 30, 2015","true","46.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","2","4","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/NeibeG/recommended/324080/","NeibeG","Bartender","http://steamcommunity.com/id/NeibeG/","170 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nEDIT: Id like to make a note about my view of the game as of now. While there are some issues that need to be addressed in the game, I want to say that I do not hate it. And that infact i see this game having great potential to grow! This can and i suspect will be an awesome game, but there are some issues that need to be fixed.\n\n\nThis game is going to need a lot of work as of right now.\n\n1. IP addresses play a role in that if you are to switch to a new router or IP address, the game will no longer recognize the original character you played on for say your single player servers. You wont be able to access your console commands with switching.\n\n2. This version of the game is only applicable to this and this only. If you were to say want to download the game separately from steam, on their website rising-world.net then you would not be able to play the game as it says you wouldnt have purchased it. as the developers stated you cannot link your steam account to your JWGames account.\nEDIT: this is more due to steam-to-standalone issues but i am sure will be corrected in time\n\n3. setting up servers is also complicated in single player options unfortunately. If you were to say use the dedicated server and run your game, you risk a reset of your single player worlds as the game would then recognize two types of the game, one as the server, and one as you playing.\n\n4. in the game itself there are a few unusual bugs such as animals flying in the air. If you were to explore say, a cave, you will probably see some animals up by the ceiling which is unusual.\n\n5. Not all of the buttons in the start up menu seem to be working either. accessing the Community button or Profile button does not work at all which would probably help fix some of the client issues.\nEDIT: also just hasnt been implemented yet. so it should come in time.","December 5, 2014","true","55.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

You appreeciate everything more thats for sure.\n\nThe only thing i find is there is no system for locating your home once your finding resources and then going back home again.

I'll review based on the negatives, BUT don't let that make you think by any stretch I think this is a bad game to any extend. I give it an honest 8/10. Onwards! (All I say is respective to the fact it is early release).\n\nThis game falls flat on several different areas but the main area I think it falls down on is it's seemingly cluttered nature. Once you get used to it, it does turn out to be slightly clearer, but still largely it will be quite hard to grasp and often times downright hideous to maneuver which can and does make building things quite hard to start doing. No doubt this will clear up, but for now I would say that is it's largest failing. The world seems to be a bit mix and match - you can spend a while searching and only find the same 5 things which can make builing something quite hard.\nAll this said, though, don't be put off by it because once you begin to grasp the basics (and I highly recommend getting Google's help at regular intervals) the game can be rather absorbing and you may find hours vanish. I love digging as deep as possible and, man you can go far down!\n\nThis may seem like a contradiction, but bear with me. The simplicity of it is a good thing. Normally there are thousands of buttons that need to be hit within a second at the exact same time for you to move forward, but this game is rather simpler in this regards. Need to hit rock, tree, mud or animal? Left click. No song and dance and prayers to the great God King Wallibandiwando. Just click.\nSome other functions might be a bit harder, but the controls are nice and fairly intuative.\n\nLastly, the emptyness can be a little... boring, I guess. I wouldn't mind maybe encountering a semi-civilized creature out there with whom I can trade or communicate with for added ease... or aggrevate and attack for added spice. That would eb nice, but without at least 2-3 friends, the world seems too empty and, dare I say it; stagnant.\n\nThe conclusion is it is overall a cute game, if nothing else. Nice and simple to control, a little hard to craft and maneuver around in addition to being sometimes boring and stagnant, but the world is overall quite nice and is capable of consuming a while. For a small game, it is surprisingly well crafted and comfortable.\n\n8/10 so far. Once it is complete, I will rewrite or edit this if needed and hopefully give it better... or give it worse, depending on what the developers do...\n\nUpdate from 11th Jul 15 - 8th Jan 16: A lot has been added and *some* of what I said above has been seen to. So far, recommendation stands.","July 10, 2015","true","5.5"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","44","4","9","2","0"

Why:\n-Nice graphics.(when you chop a tree it fall, not wood jus apear in your inventory)\n-Not to many random crashes like other survival games.\n-You can make anything you want.\n-If you look at disk space that it need (500mb... I know it changed maybe but now this is it) is normal to have some bug onther games have 5-20gb and lots more bugs and I see it updates often so it have some potencial.\nIt have some problems too:\n-Too easy.(when you fight with a bear it stop and then it attack, a goat can kill you faster)\n-Not many crafting recepies(with stone you can make almost any block and you can make new axes and pickaxes but they are unbreakeble) - I think that will change in some updates, but for now I want to mention it.\n-After 8 hours of gameplay on a survival map you make all the thinks you need(ore, wood ,etc) for small construction if you want to build asowme thinks(I want to say I want to build more stuff but.....

You have access for dozens of texture and hundreds of shape for everyblock. With the building system, real-a-like buildings can be built.\n\nAnother better side of game is, of course, digging system. While you are busy with creating mines, dirt and stone brakes with a good reality and you can see more natural paths according to minecraft.\n\nCrafting system is also promising but it is very inadequate right now.\n\nSurvival mode is also absent right now.\n\nAs a conlusion, good early access game and very promising for the future.\n\n","March 16, 2015","true","12.3"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","3","7","0","0"

This game is pretty much an Interior Design / Architect sim.\n\n-CONS\nPretty poorly optimized,so you need a pretty decent gaming PC to run it at the lowest settings (KEEP THAT IN MIND BEFORE BUYING!!)\nLittle to no combat until you get to certain areas.\nCrafting, and initial building is a tad confusing. (Make sure to actually read tutorial.)\nMining, and removing blocks feels exremely clunky, considering most of the time, it's too dark, or too much grass is in your way.\nPlaying alone for about an hour can get really boring if you're just on your own.\n\nWhile you may think that the pros outweigh the cons, just realize that it's a much better version of Minecraft, honestly. 100's of different buidling blocks. Full furniture sets, and just tons of stuff. You really do get more bang for your buck if you bought this game instead of MC. You might want to wait until it is on sale though, and maybe try to play it with a friend....\n\nWith that, I'd give this game a solid 6.5 out of 10 cucumber dips.

There appears to have been a 'stealth' patch 0.5.7.6 and since then (and 0.5.7.7), I have not experienced any more random invisible holes in the terrain (other when I've tried the fly-mode when it seems you can fly through the ground and then die - but then trying to fly through the ground should be realistic enough to kill you so I can hardly complain about that!)\nDiscovered that running uphill to escape bears was far more practical.  Turning around half-way up a mountain and hacking at them with a freshly sharpened battleaxe tends to slow them down a fair bit too...There are still animal collision errors but these aren't game breaking imho so I can live with those and I'm sure will get fixed in future updates.\nGlad to be back enjoying RW...\n\n\nAlpha 0.5.7.5 Review\nI'd like to make it clear from the start that my downvote is Not Recommended At The Moment.  I think this game shows a lot of promise and has the grounding to develop a great deal of scope but let me provide a brief synopsis of my first three games:\n1: Spawned next to a bear, died. Respawned next to same bear, died, Respawned, ran away bleeding profusely, made it all the way to the plains, could no longer hear bear, turned around, mauled by bear and died\n2: Game with caves. Spent a couple of hours deforesting, mining my area and caves, only found coal. After an hour or so of collecting coal, fell through ground and died\n3: Game without caves - yippee - ores now appear on the ground! Found iron, copper, tungsten, aluminium and coal in the first few hours.  Built a small base, workbenches, anvil, lots of food, campfire grill.  Went exploring, got lost as no clear waypoints to view but collected more ore and decided to build another base and then hopefully find my way back.  Fell through ground, died\n\nSo after ten hours of gaming I've got nothing to show for it other than a base I can't find and the distinct possibility of losing my inventory through a pretty game-breaking bug.  Also, the collision detection for animals is broken as they can wander through walls (so running back to your stone-walled base to escape a bear isn't an option - they'll just appear next to you).\n\nThis is early Alpha and hopefully the developers (who, so far, seem to be really active in updating - let's hope that continues!) will fix the bugs, add some more content and I can go back to this in a while and enjoy the experience.\n\nAdditional 29Jun15:\nTried one more game.  Played for a couple of hours, no issues. Reloaded the next day and the terrain around my base has 'dropped' completely, mountains are now mainly invisible and items are spawning in mid-air. If I walk around dropped terrain, I fall into complete darkness and my only option is the command console goto #spawn. So still not recommended...","June 28, 2015","true","26.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","40","2","5","2","2"

This game is pretty much an Interior Design / Architect sim.\n\n-CONS\nPretty poorly optimized,so you need a pretty decent gaming PC to run it at the lowest settings (KEEP THAT IN MIND BEFORE BUYING!!)\nLittle to no combat until you get to certain areas.\nCrafting, and initial building is a tad confusing. (Make sure to actually read tutorial.)\nMining, and removing blocks feels exremely clunky, considering most of the time, it's too dark, or too much grass is in your way.\nPlaying alone for about an hour can get really boring if you're just on your own.\n\nWhile you may think that the pros outweigh the cons, just realize that it's a much better version of Minecraft, honestly. 100's of different buidling blocks. Full furniture sets, and just tons of stuff. You really do get more bang for your buck if you bought this game instead of MC. You might want to wait until it is on sale though, and maybe try to play it with a friend....\n\nWith that, I'd give this game a solid 6.5 out of 10 cucumber dips.

It's slowly moving forward (for example, there's more than one hostile animal with the last update), but there isn't much else to do besides eat watermelons and build stuff.\n\nIf however, your favorite thing about Minecraft and similar games was the creative constructions, then I have no doubt that Rising World can cover that base nicely.  There's a massive amount of decorations you can create, as well as crazy amounts of block variations within catagories (there's dozens of different brick types, for example).  Every piece is rotateable to any angle, and the environment is voxel based.\n\nIf you like to build, this is a good example of how to do it, but I would hold off if you're more interested in survival mechanics.","January 14","true","1.6"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Examlpe, I was deep in a mine, getting hungry, I simply ran outside, grabbed a few tomatoes sorted.\n\nHaving said that, its probably the best crafting game I have played. There is so much to build and so may different block options the game will keep you motivated to farm mats so you can build more and more structures.\n\nI am a much bigger fan of Survival games with a little crafting thrown in (e.g. 7 days to die) but this game is definitely a lot of fun even though the element of environment dangers is missing.\n\nOverall, if you like crafting games, you must buy this however despite the tag, this isn't a survival game but still a lot of fun.","October 3, 2015","true","6.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

No clip mode is usually a cheat and there is a hotkey to enable it in this game..It makes it way too easy to escape from bears or danger, like falling from a cliff. So it takes away a major element of survival and risk.\n\nAnother thing I find lame is the fact you can build modern furniture with basic salvaged materials from the wilderness, which doesn't really make sense. And to be honest, I find it dumb.\n\nIf future updates remove the need for no-clip/fly mode, remove unrealistic furniture which doesn't belong in the game, introduce tech and perhaps even introduce an RPG-like system for character development I think this game will be really great. It's in early stages so I will assume the devs are still experimenting with things at the moment.\n\nThe game could also use mobs/enemies, besides bears. It would be so cool if their were randomly generated camps and factions of bad guys etc..Either human or fictional monsters would both be cool.\n\nAnyways, I there are so many possibilities for what could be added to this game..I can't name them all.\n\nRight now it's a bit bland and boring, but I'm happy to support development.","October 2, 2015","true","2.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I like it and have a lot of fun with the amazing building aspect, but the game still needs a lot more. More crafting stations, more creatures, more items, things of the sort. It just lacks with the variety of items and things. Other than that I like it, but I'd play it a lot more when it's got a lot more things on it.

Examlpe, I was deep in a mine, getting hungry, I simply ran outside, grabbed a few tomatoes sorted.\n\nHaving said that, its probably the best crafting game I have played. There is so much to build and so may different block options the game will keep you motivated to farm mats so you can build more and more structures.\n\nI am a much bigger fan of Survival games with a little crafting thrown in (e.g. 7 days to die) but this game is definitely a lot of fun even though the element of environment dangers is missing.\n\nOverall, if you like crafting games, you must buy this however despite the tag, this isn't a survival game but still a lot of fun.","October 3, 2015","true","6.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

This game is an exception. That reason is because you don't need much time to see it's potential. Sure it's Early Access, but the devs are very loyal. They listen to us. They even posted the other day about tips to get aound bugs that they are working on. Some may say it's a Minecraft Clone. There is one major difference though... that is that this game is more realistic. It tries to be more about surivival instead of enchanting crap and being OP in 3 days of Hardcore mode (I've done it a LOT). If you like survival games, treat yourself to this game and go buy it.

However, there aren't many servers and only a few speak English. Many servers rarely have more than 5 people as well. I don't know whether it might be my timezone because most servers are either German or Dutch, but this game needs more people (and English people) in the servers. Overall this game is worth WAY MORE than your 15 BUCKS and offers a lot more than Minecraft. The developers are also active within the community and show great support. Please buy this game and support them so we can have an even better experience!\n\nIn this game you pretty much aim to try and establish a nice house and some furniture as well as other stuff to make your property of land look nice. There are also bears and you can mine just like you can in minecraft, although there isn't so much of that "blocky" feeling making the environment feel more smoother and realistic.\n\nThank you to the developers of Rising World as it is one of the best open world games I've played.","October 23, 2015","true","2.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I cut down trees, killed pigs, built a house, and went mining. Later in the game, I started exploring farming and all the furnitrure items I could create.\n\nThis game is focused mainly on BUILDING. The survival aspects aren't truly there yet. At the moment there aren't any enemies besides bears. The world feels more friendly this way, but building shelters feels a little pointless. Building is hella fun though. It's like Minecraft but the graphics make it completely different in it's own way. There are many different textured blocks as well.\n\nMany glitches right now, but the dev is very active in the forums and is obviously working hard on the game. Watch some videos of this game, and if it looks interesting, I highly reccomend it.\n\nPros:\n+ Graphics\n+ Building Mechanics\n+ Destructible environment\n+ Tree cutting\n+ Farming\n+ Cooking and Smelting functions\n+ Multiplayer\n+ Very active dev team\n\nCons\n- Glitches\n- No threatening enemies\n- Survival aspect is very easy as there is plenty of food everywhere.\n- Not very in depth (yet).\n- VERY easy to get lost at beginning.\n\n7/10 at the moment, but the future holds so much potential for this game.

There is a passive mode for players who dont want to experience the violence from wilderness animals (single player only). The game has great potential and can be played in multiplayer as well. I havent played on a public server yet but we have a LAN server here at home that 3 of us play on. Hosting a server is a bit complicated at the moment but Im sure will be fixed eventually. There are also server hosting sites that support the game. Theres still some bugs but thats to be expected with any EA game. The game runs on windows 7-10 fine, not sure about anything else though. But despite the bugs, you could basicly build a whole city with some interesting geometry and then mine the ground underneath you. Supposedly there is a hell if you mine that far but i havent yet.\nI've played many open world survivals and this one reaches out to me.  The game is built in Java so make sure thats up to date.

Make no mistake, this is a Minecraft derivitive.  However, it containes significant improvements (other than graphical) and new ideas to recommend it over the older (and simpler) game.\n\nI will postpone a full review until more content is added. In the meantime, there are two points to hightlight: First, this game is currently in alpha stage and likely will be for several more months (01/16 right now).  Development has been at a slow but steady pace.  While this is somewhat of a detriment, it is evidence of a "don't release until we're ready to" attitude amongst development staff.  Second, the developers have been VERY responsive to player feedback and maintain a constant presence on the discussion board.  It's very telling that there is a developer comment in almost every thread.\n\nConclusion: It's too early.  If you liked Minecraft, you'll probably enjoy playing this right now, but it still has a ways to go before broader appeal.

It's one of the best sandbox games I've played, but there is room for improvement. The new farming system really helps, but there is a lack of ranged weapons; usually resulting in me being slain by a bear! Character customization should be added some how, so you can cover up your players bald head!\nIs it worth the £10.99 i payed for it?\nYes! The survival aspect is brilliant, the building system is amazing too I would deffinately recommend this game to people looking to have a laugh with their mates, or to record a let's paly on!\nI can really see this game going somwhere in the near future! 10/10","May 11, 2015","true","37.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

There is a passive mode for players who dont want to experience the violence from wilderness animals (single player only). The game has great potential and can be played in multiplayer as well. I havent played on a public server yet but we have a LAN server here at home that 3 of us play on. Hosting a server is a bit complicated at the moment but Im sure will be fixed eventually. There are also server hosting sites that support the game. Theres still some bugs but thats to be expected with any EA game. The game runs on windows 7-10 fine, not sure about anything else though. But despite the bugs, you could basicly build a whole city with some interesting geometry and then mine the ground underneath you. Supposedly there is a hell if you mine that far but i havent yet.\nI've played many open world survivals and this one reaches out to me.  The game is built in Java so make sure thats up to date.

Make no mistake, this is a Minecraft derivitive.  However, it containes significant improvements (other than graphical) and new ideas to recommend it over the older (and simpler) game.\n\nI will postpone a full review until more content is added. In the meantime, there are two points to hightlight: First, this game is currently in alpha stage and likely will be for several more months (01/16 right now).  Development has been at a slow but steady pace.  While this is somewhat of a detriment, it is evidence of a "don't release until we're ready to" attitude amongst development staff.  Second, the developers have been VERY responsive to player feedback and maintain a constant presence on the discussion board.  It's very telling that there is a developer comment in almost every thread.\n\nConclusion: It's too early.  If you liked Minecraft, you'll probably enjoy playing this right now, but it still has a ways to go before broader appeal.  This game has a ton of potential within the genre.\n","January 14","true","68.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Too many unfinished games of this kind have left a bad taste in my mouth over the years, some even after they  were "finished". Therefore, Rising World proved a pleasant surprise. Make no mistake, the game is lacking in quite a few areas and bears clear indicators of being far from finished. But that's actually part of what excites me about it. Because it has immense amounts of potential, and is already a truly enjoyable game I can easily see myself investing WAY too much time in. If you like survival building games and don't mind Early Access, Rising World is well worth your buck, although in its current stage, it might be a bit tedious in the long run. But if the developers pull through and keep making the game it seems like they want to make, I think it'll end up being a damn good investement.","January 1","true","13.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

However, there aren't many servers and only a few speak English. Many servers rarely have more than 5 people as well. I don't know whether it might be my timezone because most servers are either German or Dutch, but this game needs more people (and English people) in the servers. Overall this game is worth WAY MORE than your 15 BUCKS and offers a lot more than Minecraft. The developers are also active within the community and show great support.

However, there aren't many servers and only a few speak English. Many servers rarely have more than 5 people as well.

I cut down trees, killed pigs, built a house, and went mining. Later in the game, I started exploring farming and all the furnitrure items I could create.\n\nThis game is focused mainly on BUILDING. The survival aspects aren't truly there yet. At the moment there aren't any enemies besides bears. The world feels more friendly this way, but building shelters feels a little pointless. Building is hella fun though. It's like Minecraft but the graphics make it completely different in it's own way. There are many different textured blocks as well.\n\nMany glitches right now, but the dev is very active in the forums and is obviously working hard on the game. Watch some videos of this game, and if it looks interesting, I highly reccomend it.\n\nPros:\n+ Graphics\n+ Building Mechanics\n+ Destructible environment\n+ Tree cutting\n+ Farming\n+ Cooking and Smelting functions\n+ Multiplayer\n+ Very active dev team\n\nCons\n- Glitches\n- No threatening enemies\n- Survival aspect is very easy as there is plenty of food everywhere.\n- Not very in depth (yet).\n- VERY easy to get lost at beginning.\n\n7/10 at the moment, but the future holds so much potential for this game.

GPU's and CPU's on both rigs well above min specs AND recommended specs, Java JRE latest version. Yet Java issue after Java issue . I know I can't run Chrome.

That is a B-. The reason I give this game a B is for the lack of creativity. Yes this game is a great take of the survival type of game but it seems like so many other games. Some games like ARK and Rust became popular due to there unique twist. This game kind of lacks this. By kind of I mean it is there but not empowering. I would rate this game 10 out of 10 if they improve graphical capabilities(I am aware this is Alpha but I would like this onceit goes to Beta or even its full relase. I also want them to add more. It has all of the core functions of a good game but needs something more.\n\nEven with this negativity I still love this game. I only have 3 hours on it. I have had it for a long time but due too my old cpmputer I could not play it. I am going to play this game more and once I get a gaming computer that runs this even better I will most likely be more updated and have a more positive review.\n\nI see a bright future in this game and I still would recommend you buying this.

Excellent.\n\nEDITED REVIEW:\nHaving tried various things (deleting and reinstalling the game, updating Java, uninstalling all versions of Java and then reinstalling the latest 32 bit and 64 bit versions of Java (both separately and together) and a few PC restarts) the game now runs. Whilst I'm happy it now runs it was certainly frustrating to have to go through any of that just to get it to run. I'm probably a little too early to yet give a proper review of the game but wanted to update my review out of fairness to the developer now that I've at least got a game to review.\n\nFrom the bit I have played so far it seems quite promising but is certainly a bit glitchy (dying from falling less than a metre and randomly popping through the roof of a cave straight on to the floor above) but that isn't too much of an issue considering it is in early access so the usual suggestion apply; don't buy it yet unless you're aware that this is not a finished/polished/bug-free game yet and are happy with that. There seems to be enough here to have some fun with but also enough glitchiness with the physics as to cause a fair amount of frustration. I may change my review to recommended in the future but at the moment, with the kerfuffle of trying to get it to even launch and the current level of completion, I don't think I can recommend it just yet.","December 13, 2014","false","1.4"," 37 of 76 people (49%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","49","37","76","3","2"

It seems like more and more glitches happen every time they update. I now cant access the game because the settings have made it too large for me to even access the settings menu to restore the defaults. My character always glitches into walls when digging, animals will suddenly appear when i first load up the game, attack me and kill me within seconds, and the act of building things/crafting things/getting the items to craft buildings is so hard it causes the game to become not so fun way to quickly.\n\nYeah it may look pretty, but sometimes the basic things need to be kept basic.

I will admit the game was pretty confusing to get running at first then I realized I just needed to download the "offline version of Java 8 update 25" and bam I'm in the game and everything is running perfectly.\n\n\nPros: Tons of craftable items, beautful graphics, well optimized, lighing effects are amazing, terrain shaping is a 1000x better than Minecraft or 7 Days to Die. You can also host your own dedicated server. Weekly updates and super active devs. If you look at the official forums, posts from months ago suggesting Item XXXXX be added and you look in the game to see that the item was added. That's that kind of devs we need more of.\n\n\n\nCons: This is a slow game. It takes forever to break rock and cut down trees. There is no point to the game (yet) because there are no enemies, there is no hunger or thirst but the dev has confirmed it's incoming. Other than that for $14 I would highly suggest this game. Especially if it starts to turn out like Minecraft.\n\n\nAs a side note also check out www.reddit.com/r/risingworld","December 26, 2014","true","4.5"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","3","8","0","0"

I guess it must have been all about gameplay and creation.\n\nWhere Minecraft fell down (badly in my opinion) Rising World takes over. The choice of textures and shapes means you can create some really eye catching structures and not a jagged pixelated mess either.\n\nThe server files are released to the public from day one (always good when you want to build a community orientated server) and the developers are down to earth and helpful, taking on board feedback and ideas to add to the game's roadmap.\n\nThe game supports LUA scripts that enable hosts and admins to customise the server they and the players want.\nFeatures such as area protection give players the chance to carry on building without the risk of losing their creation to a griefer - the scourge of many a game.\n\nIn its current form - I would give the game an 8/10 even with a few bugs as it's in early alpha.\n\nI've had a server running for the past week and enjoy seeing what players come up with in their creations.\n\nJust to add that there are some features I haven't seen in other games - such as being able to upload an image (to use as a poster) in-game. Being able to fully rotate alot of the objects enabling more and more possibilities when constructing a building or area.A piano in-game that you can play and hear others playing. Things like the sound of your footsteps on stone, soil and metal and the little details that have been added to make it more immersive.\n\nI usually only play first person shooters and military sims - but this game is a breath of fresh air. It is probably in the same genre as The Forest and Rust but offers alot more content creation ability. I look forward to seeing how the game evolves over the coming months and recommend it to anyone that wants to try something a little different.\n\nOur server will run for as long as the game develops <plug> (named "V for Victory") </plug> and I look forward to spending more hours in Rising World.

You can craft and build pretty much anything you can dream off, cottage, house or castle you name it you can make it. The crafting of "blocks" is amazing, you might think its simple blocks like Minecraft but its a whole new world really. You can make them in loads of different shapes and add seats, stairs, flooring, and even a toilet if you wish. This coupled with the hunting and weaponry building make this something pretty anyone that likes to build should keep their eye on!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-S7vC1R-NI","April 7, 2015","true","1.4"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

The world is beautiful. The cavern systems are very interesting and creepy, and while digging mines, sometimes you find them by accident.  The world terrain is very very deep.  They even put in a hell at the bottom where you see rivers and lakes of molten lava and islands of hellstone spires.  The building is very easy, and there are a lot of block material options.  All-in-all it is a great start!\n\nIt is very early  in development, and I am sure there is still a lot to be added; however, the developers are very open to Lua scripting and mods.  I have been asking them a ton of questions about their Lua API and they have answered every question very quickly.  They are about the nicest development team that you will ever meet!  I love their concepts and I really hope this game keeps going, because it is going to be one of the best!","December 11, 2014","true","39.5"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","1","4","0","0"

At first I didn't understand the controls that well, but once I understood how it worked (I am a minecraft fanatic, just really used to those controls), I couldn't stop playing. The vast open worlds for exploring are beautiful, and the animals all about the place is great. Theres also food everywhere, so it's hard to starve. Also, the cave systems... oh man, so realistic looking. Looking over ledges in caves gives me chills because of my fear of heights. Also the torch in hand light system is pretty sick too. All in all, I give this game a 5/5 stars, even for an early alpha game with plenty of features to come!\n\nP.S.

For those who haven't heard of it, it's a MMO where you mine, chop wood, do quests, cook, farming, and lots of other skills. The goal was to reach level 100 and you're username would be on the leaderboard.\n\nThis is also reminds me of Minecraft with the sandbox, open world feeling. But Rising world takes it a step further will amazing graphics for it being only in "Early Access"\n\nThe control are a bit weird, and need getting use to, but really every game will be that way. You can change the shortcut keys (Such as your inventory to the E key just like in Minecraft; you can do this in the settings)\n\nThere are bugs, such as trees flying away if it lands on you and you're on the side of a hill. Logs will float once in awhile in the air for no reason. Could use a cleaner and slimmer interface for the main menu and settings dialog.\n\nThe support forums is mixed with German and English users. There is a Wiki, but not filled with all the needed info, perhaps due to this game being in Early Access still.\n\nI would highly suggest this game if you have previous experience with Minecraft and want some real world graphics. But I warn you there are bugs of course. But the main functions work just fine.\n\nLong as the team continues to add updates, and perhaps doing it more often in short updates, that may show more activity to the community and keep our hopes up. :)","December 2, 2015","true","5.3"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

The world is beautiful. The cavern systems are very interesting and creepy, and while digging mines, sometimes you find them by accident.  The world terrain is very very deep.  They even put in a hell at the bottom where you see rivers and lakes of molten lava and islands of hellstone spires.  The building is very easy, and there are a lot of block material options.  All-in-all it is a great start!\n\nIt is very early  in development, and I am sure there is still a lot to be added; however, the developers are very open to Lua scripting and mods.  I have been asking them a ton of questions about their Lua API and they have answered every question very quickly.  They are about the nicest development team that you will ever meet!  I love their concepts and I really hope this game keeps going, because it is going to be one of the best!","December 11, 2014","true","39.5"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","1","4","0","0"

I wasn't able to find any lakes or water unfortunately, nor is the collision detection and AI pathing smooth just yet.  Cows when hit, for example, walk a few steps, stop, turn, walk a few steps, stop, walk a few more, etc.  There's plenty to craft at the present time, though some of the items don't seem to require materials (I'm assuming costs will be added later as more raw resources make their way into the game, but I'm guessing).

Some times for no apparent reason, some times when cutting down trees tree will fall on top of your head and knock you below the terrain and in all cases you end up dead.\n\nAlso when I set home point for respawn after death it never works and when I click the respawn it spawns me with in the terrain just to be stuck and if there is no one on the server to help you get out you are stuck indifferently and once again end up dead just to repeat it all over again and end up having to just leave the server and try again on another server and experience the same things.\n\nI also had trouble with the storage chests. I experienced large numbers of items disapearing in a few different situations. Some times when moving items from my person to the chest using a click and drag method some stacks would move successfully where some would not and just disappear, not in your inventory and not on the ground.\n\nI also tried bouble clicking items to move them from personal inventory to the storage chest and just like the click and drag method I got the same results, some successfully moving and some just vanishing into thin air. And I also had stacks of items vanish when trying to move them from the storage chest to my person.\n\nAlso getting lots of Java errors and my java is up to date, not sure what the java errors areall about.\n\nAll in all as of now I would not suggest spending your hard earned money on this game until it is fully realsed and the bugs are worked out of it, good concept and will probably be good in the future if the Dev puts his mind to fixing issues and adds more content.

Now I must mention, make sure you have Java 64 bit installed BEFORE downloading this game, as many people seemed to have difficulty starting it up. If you happen to accidentally download it without Java already installed I'd recommend deleting Rising World from your computer (e.g. delete from steam library) install java, then redownload the game. Something I want to tell the developers- man, this game would be so awesome if there was a slight horror element added to it. If I could have my way I'd have it to the point where at night you could barely see past your torchlight and monsters ran up on you very quickly and out of nowhere. I'd also add spooky atmospheric noises once night falls, along with terrifyingly loud noises once a monster has attacked you. Although I'd pay $100 for that to be implemented, you guys have done so well so far I'd recommend just sticking to your instinct and follow your goal of whatever you wanted Rising World to be. Keep up the fantastic work, you guys definitely have something special here.","December 4, 2014","true","2.7"," 6 of 16 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","6","16","0","0"

It reminds me of a mix of Minecraft, Rust, and Space Engineers (the mining/collection/control aspect). Beautiful graphics and I really like the night vision mode! I'm not sure if thats an early feature that will go away or not... but its nice being able to mine without torches!\n\nVery unfinished at this point, you can only collect wood and stone, but any items you need that aren't craftable... you can just... GET. Done! It's got a lot of cool crafting possibilities that are all vanilla, which you would require a dozen minecraft mods to match.

If you ever get lonely you can play multiplayer! (you may of already seen that in the trailer) Worth a purchase without a doubt, the only issue that I had (notice the "had") was having to learn alot about Java.

Early stages but im liking the general ideas of this game not to mention the fact that for me personally this is ideal for someone that enjoys working at their own pace on a survival/sandbox sort of game, a casual experience. So far there are a few basic options in creating your own worlds including flat worlds, cave orientated worlds or forest/dense worlds. This is going to be an interesting development for me and hopefully if all goes well and problems ironed out this could turn out to be a very nice tidy game. I will write another review once ive sunk my teeth into it properly for a good day or so. For those unsure of purchasing, maybe best to hold on tight for now and keep up with other peoples reviews as early access purchases always come with a risk. Money comes and goes (and i appreciate its harder for some people to make) but for this price i had to personally take the chance and show my support.

Put them into the ground ...natural conclusin,nea, they stay there and when you cut them again , they are still suplings......\n\nItems that you can place down. Great until you want to move then to a diferent location. Then you have to destroy then copletly, you get no resaurses back you have to go and find new material to rebuild them.

I didn't know it was possible to make something even more boring than Minecraft.  Sure the environment is more customizable than Minecraft but its only slightly so you eventually see the same angles over and over again.  Its hard to figure out how you need to build your mine shaft so you can climb back out of it.

But after that i was a little let down, thinking i might be able to play this game. So i reset my PC and tried to launch the game and it worked fine and dandy. The title screen like minecraft with your options on the left, so when your logged in and ready to play, you make your world and jump right in. right away i find my first animal and kill it, i notice Pigs dont have food in them but this is in Alpha so i cant say i didnt exspect it to be done. so as im playing i find the crafting tab. and i was so sad at first. cause the menu has like 5 or 6 categories with 1 or 2 items in each, then i saw the workbench and was so releaved. So i made my underground house and made my workbench, and started to make a house... out of Plaster. and that worked fine and dandy. and i made all the crafting stations and a really big, nice house. So this is a really nice game, i dont regret buying this game.

This game is a good example why it's such a stupid system: In it's current state, I do recommend this game for a particular group of players (creative only), but I also I don't recommend it for the other group (survivor enthusiasts). I'm part of the second group, so I made my "thumb" choice based on that. Moving on...\n\nCame back to the game after about a year and check it's current state. Some new biomes, animals, the world has water now. The caves look much better, not the mess I remember from my last playthrough. Slow progress, but I have no problem with that. Games need time to be developted, and this one looks pretty ambitious, so I don't mind waiting.\n\nThat being said, still gets a thumbs down from me. If you're the creative tipe, by all means buy it. If you're into survivor, buy only to support the devs, if you believe in them. The survival aspect of the game is not bad, because it simply doesn't exist yet. All you have to do to stay alive is eat a fruit here and there, and run away from the occasional bear/tiger. Or you can kill them with some weapons you can craft, whatever. It doesn't really matter because the "survivor" stuff you have right now is a very simplistic placeholder.\n\nLot's of potential, but for now it's for creative people only.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOriginal Review:\n\nFor anyone familiar with Minecraft, this EA is not worth the asking price right now, unless you're a creative enthusiast and are tired of poor Minecraft clones .\n\nIt has potential, but for now it's a Minecraft clone with better graphics, don't be fooled by those positive reviews. I think most of those recommending the game never played MC before, because It plays exactly like that one. Absolutely nothing new, unless you consider different shapes for building and the option to upload your own images into the game something groundbreaking.\n\nI'll keep updating this review as new features are added. I'm all for EA and crowd funding projects (Kickstarter), and I can only hope the devs keep their word and don't turn this into a MC on steroids. Maybe it turns out to be an evolution from MC, but in its current state there's no way I can recommend this, specially if you're a MC veteran looking for something new.","May 27, 2015","false","5.9"," 2 of 9 people (22%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","22","2","9","0","2"

What I want to know is when do you fix your glitches? I played the game and it reminds me of the time Minecraft had the same stuff. I fell through the graphics landed in Hell which is -830 Y axis.\nIf you buy the game press F3 for Location. In the top left hand corner is you X axis, Y axis , and  Z axis. My advise to the programmers is this is not funny! We pay for your game and get glitches!\nHow big did you make the map? Java is not ment for games and I will say it again! Break out the C language and fix it! Since your in your Alpha version and not in you prime... start paying for gaming testers! I would like people to know I do not lie about this.\nSystem specs for this game should read as Follows.\n\ni7 core  60 GB processing speed\nMemory 164 GB\nVidoe card 80 GB processing speed\nShader set for 90\n\nMight as well start with your parents vacant room for 8 super towers that cost you $148,000.00\nEven then maybe you can run their game properly.\n\nKey word for designers is smaller maps  X axis 148 , Y axis 54, Z axis 148. I would think someone would wise up.\nIf we need to explore a new content load a new map with the same dimisions.  Other wise give up we don't need another Minecraft correction!","January 4","false","23.6"," 1 of 9 people (11%) found this review helpful","11","1","9","0","0"

I wish is was not so expansive to include asphalt and modern buildings  but it is about the same.   The chopping and digging routines are pretty much out of place swinging in the air but I am sure they will enhance those automations in the future or if not remain stupid looking.\n\nNo water in the game that I have found but they say it will be added next patch.

In several dozens of hours of playing I did not have a single crash and only one (non-blocking) bug with mouse capture in full screen, dependent on my multi-monitor setup.\n\nThe number of items which can be crafted is already quite large (there is even a piano you can actually play!) and only a fraction of them are 'blocky' (in fact, for a voxel game, the general appearance is very far from obviously 'blocky').\n\nImplemented functions/features include: mining, processing of stone and ore into resources, gathering food, hunting, farming and harvesting of a number of crops, including trees for wood resources (no herding, though), terraforming, and of course crafting. Practically anything there is in the world can be acted upon and/or modified/removed/destroyed.\n\nThe graphics are very well engineered: trees, grass, stone, ore veins within stone, all looks quite realistic,even after modifying them. The game is also not very hungry in specs: with my oldish ATI HD 5770, the tens of thousands of grass blades and of landscape blocks are rendered with no noticeable impact on the fluidity of movement.\n\nOf course, there are things not implemented yet, as it can be expected in an Alpha: the biggest limit is probably in survival. There is a survival mode, but the only dangers you risk to meet are starving and falling from too high. The crafting tree is relatively wide (a fair number of item to make) but short: only one or two steps from the raw resource(s) to the finished product. There is no water, nor weather or seasons. There are commands for displaying a clock and a compass, but they do nothing at the moment. I did fall in a hole in the ground and broke a bone: there seems to be no way of mending it, nor does it affect character abilities in any way. I expected most of the limitation to be overcome as the programme evolves (and, yes, it does evolve).\n\nSome design choices might be questionable; primarily, the impossibility to move objects once placed in the world, even objects which in the 'real world' work because they can be moved, like chairs. Once placed, anything can only be destroyed and rebuilt elsewhere (NOT TRUE: see edit below!).\n\nThese limitations notwithstanding, the game is fully enjoyable and very mature for an Alpha (and possibly not only for an Alpha). I already spent on it more hours than I expected and now I know I will spend many many more, even before further updates will add new features.\n\nEDIT: I was wrong! It IS possible to un-place placed objects, getting them back and placing them elsewhere. Another plus for RW!","April 21","true","218.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

No zombies or anything like that, just you and the local fauna.\nRelaxing, not a hardcore survival game.\nDevs are very responsive and willing to sort out your problems.\nCons:\nBugs, bugs and more bugs. Animals clipping through walls, light acts funny, etc.\nLinux version suffers more severe bugs due to some libraries used.\nRequires you to create yet another online account.\nThere isn't really all that much to do at the moment other than to build enormous sandcastles to compensate for your personal shortcomings so unless you are really into building stuff, the game might become boring after a while.\nControls, when it comes to finetuning the building process to make something nice, are not exactly the most intuitive and sometimes it is incredibly frustrating to get the pieces snap together the way you want them to.","May 24","true","74.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","7"
