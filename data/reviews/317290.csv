It’s a visual novel produced by one of the Western masters of the form, Winterwolves. That means a choose-your-own-adventure with pretty pictures. Simple enough. Where it gets tough is trying to summarize the story.Bionic Heart 2 picks up where the canon path of Bionic Heart left off. Tom, Luke, and Helen escape from Richard Meier by scrounging up some fake IDs and hitching a ride to Mars. Tanya, an android in love with Luke, stays on Earth and attempts to fight the super corporation of Richard Meier by herself.Each playable perspective (Tanya, Luke, Tom, and Tina) are used to illustrate different parts of the conflicts that become integral to the plot. Each choice brings you closer to uncovering the conspiracy headed up by Nanotech or brings you closer to death. It’s a wild ride like any noir crime story that leaves brings interesting twists and revelations to light and raises the question of what it is to be human.Overall, the writing is decent. The story is interesting and the direction isn't terribly predictable. The numerous scenes throughout the story are well paced. Bionic Heart 2 promotes interest is the inclusion of “social boss fights.” These are essentially dialogue puzzles where the goal is to win over the character you are talking to. At the most basic implementation, it means filling a bar to 100% by making the right choices, but as you get further along the formula is changed, thus keeping the mechanic fresh throughout the experience.The environment art is stunning, but the character art could use some work. The outfits and the characters' hair are good, but the faces appear slightly smudged, giving the impression of a lack of polish.The audio tracks are original and contribute to the unique game atmosphere and universe.Bionic Heart 2 is a game worth experiencing. If you’re a sci-fi, noir, neo-noir, crime, or visual novel fan, chances are you’ll find something to latch onto and get a lot of enjoyment out of the game. It’s full of replayability as well, thanks to multiple endings and a well thought-out story.Bionic Heart 2 is an interesting adventure and visual novel worth playing.","December 14, 2014","true","16.1"," 28 of 35 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","28","35","0","0"

In terms of content, it felt like there was a lot more dialogue. The 'social boss fights' were kinda funny but in the end it wasn't anything groundbreaking (which isn't too bad). It's just a similar way to trigger flags. When it comes to art, I definitely saw a big difference. The characters were still drawn quite well but I wasn't able to recognize the same style that was present in the Heileen series and BH1. The art was still quite good though. I really like the sequel's version of Julia as opposed to the previous game.\n\nNice VN overall. I'd give it a 4/5.","February 10, 2015","true","1.6"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","16","19","0","0"

In the first moment the graphics seem pretty improved comparing to Bionic Heart 1. Dialogues are now inside the text window. They introduced newly some bossfights (order decision answers) and a new gameplay. Now can progress in the story but have to set about a dozen of savepoints to playthrough all endings. A bit nervy is that you have beat the final endboss for each of the endings. Still a good piece of VN.","January 12","true","1.8"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","13","14","0","0"

The writing could be the mayor issue. It is  much better than that of its predecessor, but still shows some inconsistencies, such as different versions of "reality" depending on the path (that may be needed for making room to the 24 endings, but I find that a bit cheaty and unimmersive), and some deus-ex-machinas hard to explain. In a few points, disconnects from the story of the first game, which I find a good decision. That should allow you to not feel obliged to play that game, which was worse than this one. Also, there are a few minor bugs here and there, nothing game-breaking or particularly annoying (but note that in Linux, the achievements don't unlock, but if you kept savegames before the endings you can load the savegames in other platform and unlock the achievements by replaying them, I had to do that). All the endings can be achieved but the guides are hard to find and follow (I couldn't find a comprehensive one). Getting all of them became a bit tedious (and frustrating because of the errors in the guides I used).\n\nOverall, it's a pretty decent game that probably should reserve more recognition that it has. It's more difficult than most others I've played, so I wouldn't recommend the game to a novice in visual novels. Experienced players should try it (beware of the different theme and setting, though).\n\nAbout the price of the game, just look at it, compare it to my hours played (and those of other players) and consider if it makes up for you.","December 6, 2014","true","18.1"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","13","17","0","0"

Sadly the developer has taken a good thing smeared feces all over it like a simian at the Zoo.\n\nAll the dark humor and wit seemed to be discarded in lieu of now boring mundane characters with no real depth and all their engaging qualities lost in this atrocious game.\n\nMy tip to the dev: Bring back your unique cartoony style of characters and animations and also bring back your voice actors so your interactive novel isn’t as stale as the rest of the bargain bin ones advertised on steam.","September 20, 2015","false","0.8"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Using the skip function to attain more endings, I had some trouble remembering the choices each character made that were the same or different from my already-achieved endings but it was impressive to see the cohesion of the story despite having several plot threads for each path.  The more serious tone of this over the prequel was a welcome change and the 24 endings provide great variety and replay value.  In addition, the new character art and social boss fights are definite improvements over the prequel.","December 2, 2015","true","3.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

It wasn’t a masterpiece, but surely more enjoyable than the sequel. I liked the art style (but sometimes there’s a certain lack of expressions — but that’s more like a pet peeve of mine) and BGM, they were nice. Bionic Heart 2 is way too serious and it becomes boring after some time playing.\n\nEven so, I recommend getting this game on a good sale. It has tons of different endings. So if you have some spare money, get BH2.\n\n5/10. I personally didn’t liked this game so much, but I must admit that the multiple endings are quite an accomplishment.

The art and effects are nice, but what's really nice is the writing. The writing is well done, and throughout multiple playthroughs, you get a feel of what each character is like, and there's so many endings that come about through choice that you make that really didn't seem to matter much at that moment. Though I have to say, lots of the endings are very similar to each other. There aren't many big reveals and all, so it's rather easy to see what kind of ending you might get, so if you'd get bored if you're the type of person that thrives on plot twists.. A pretty nice visual novel overall, and a good way to pass time if you want a solid story.","September 10, 2015","true","5.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Every pro in this sequel has a con:\n\n* The character art is far more appealing to me (I hated the exaggerated look in the first game), but Luke in particular appears too young considering that the first game says that he's 35.\n\n* The writing is better (the first game's dialogue was clunky and amateurish, and rife with typos), but the narrative still suffers from long stretches of exposition. And I still don't get why we can understand the cat.\n\n* I appreciate the multiple points of view, but the characters don't quite mesh with their original-game selves in terms of their priorities, behaviors, personalities, and even vocabulary. This game feels like a sequel-but-not-a-sequel in many ways as a result.\n\n* This game's branches are more interesting than those of the first game, and I also like how it's possible for the story to continue even after someone messes up in a "boss battle," but on occasion the endings conflict a bit.\n\n* Finally, going back to the sequel-but-not-a-sequel feeling, the tone of this story is quite a departure from that of the first game. This story tries so hard to be much more serious, with higher stakes and far-reaching consequences. Sometimes it works, but other times it's pure melodrama.\n\nIn the end, I can't say that the improvements in this sequel make it a good game, but I did like it better than its predecessor. I'm hoping to see good things in the other Winter Wolves games I still have left to play.","February 20","false","8.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
