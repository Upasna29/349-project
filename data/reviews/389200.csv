I've only played the game for a short time  as yet, but  closed the game down because  the game kept freezing, or more  like  no ball would reappear after losing one.  This was frustrating because I was enjoying playing the game.  It's colorful, has multiplayer support, you can play with   several players and the shape of the  game arena is different to the usual  breakout games.\n\nOne thing i would ask the developers to change  is the bat and ball physics, at least to stop   the ability to just  let the ball  run  automatically  and destroy virtually every brick without even having to move the bat.  When  a new ball  is available it is centered on the bat.  If you position the bat directly below   a set of bricks and don'tmove the bat at all, it will just move in a vertical  manner until you move the bat off center.  most breakouts   can change the angle of the ball rebound so this usually doesn't happen.  I destroyed every  brick on the first level without moving the bat, on the second level  only two small bricks were left and same with the third level.  This can obviously be overcome immediately   after the  new ball has left the bat, by changing the position of the bat  slightly,  the ball with then rebound at an angle.\n\nI will be playing this a lot more over the next few days and will  edit this  short  initial review to reflect  my new gaming experiences with this game.\n\n\nEdit:\n\nPlayed the game for a  short while today and  managed to get to the second level before the ball stuck to the side of the boundary and slowly moved towards the bottom.  I was hoping  that the ball would fall off onto the bat, but when it got to the bottom, it just stayed there.  I left it for  a few moments, but no change.   You can see where the ball ended up once it has stopped crawling down the right hand side of the arena:\n\nBall Stuck to side of Arena[s13.postimg.org]\n\n\nThe developer definitely needs to iron out some of the bugs. I realise this is  early access, so  we can expect such glitches, but as it stands it's virtually unplayable.\n\n2nd edit:\n\nAlready posted this elsewhere, but though I should post it here as well:\n\nsuggestions:\n\n... Change the bat physics so that the ball veers off at an angle at any point on the bat\n... Include different shaped balls   which will add even more possibiliteis with respect to   ball angles\n... Include a level editor so that we can create our own levels.  If you included a page on your web site where the community could share  these levels, you may get something as successful as ricochet Infinity - We may even get a workshop section here on Steam.\n... Create more  arena shapes, not just the  one used a tthe moment, including the traditional  square/oblong  arena;s.  A round one would be nice.\n... Possiblt include  some 3D tables.  i've never seen a breakout game that uses both 2D and 3D  tables, so this would add  something really  different.\n...  Add more power ups and  allow the   player to be able to configure  the game  to use   specific power ups. This would enable  much more replayability   as you could play each level over and over  but use different combinations of power ups.\n... I nclude secret levels that  can only be accessed  with  certain combinations of power ups and  brick combinations.\n... If you did include an editor, also  incude the ability to  design  own brick shapes\n... Include more varieties of brick shapes","August 1, 2015","true","14.4"," 15 of 15 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","15","15","0","1"

Brick breaking games haven't got an unique twist in a LONG time so I was glad to hear that last month NANOS came out on steam in Early Access.\n\nIt's a fun game that you can play to kill some spare time and ofcours it's fun to play with your friends (I recommend to play it on a big screen from your couch when you're beating your friends).\n\nThe game does still has some bugs but i haven't had a major problem with them (it actually came in pretty handy when a bug would appear against a friend :P) and i hope that the developers will fix them soon.","September 23, 2015","true","9.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Shatter uses air currents as it's unique element. Wizorb uses magic, however these powerups are usually still reminiscent of Arkanoid and as such, will give the problem of clearing that one single block over and over again.\nWith rotation, different kind of playing fields and multiplayer in one single field, it gets rid of that tedious gameplay. And with such a price, I definitely find it worth the try.","September 8, 2015","true","0.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"
