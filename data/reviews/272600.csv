"http://steamcommunity.com/id/linibot/recommended/272600/","linibot","Lin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/linibot/","556 products in account","A really fun and endearing little point & click that stands out for its narrative qualities. Unfortunately it is also very streamlined and easy, at least for anyone who has played the first game in the series and expects a bit of a sleuthing challenge.\n\nSome history...Detective Grimoire's first appearance was several years back in a free browser game that you should go and play right now[armorgames.com] if you haven't already. As a browser game it was unique, interesting, well made (for a free game) and its best selling point was that you were actually required to do some detective work: The game expected you to collect clues, solve puzzles, interrogate people with a fun little lie detecting mechanic, and actually stop, think and make some deductions on your own before you could accuse someone of the crime. It was perfectly possible to make mistakes if you didn't think things through and that was exactly what made the game really interesting.\n\n...and some crushed expectations.This is sadly not the case with its crowdfunded follow-up. You are asked to sit back and enjoy an easy ride, in which yes, you are interacting with the world and the story in interesting ways, but, no, you are not asked to do any real thinking of your own. And then when you have collected all the strands and are hyped about thinking through the mystery, the game will step in and hold your hand while it reveals its secrets. To me (with my previous high expectations) it felt dumbed down, and that was a disappointment.\n\nThe Good: Writing, Art, Animation, SoundtrackThat said, this is a really really good, if short, point & click. It is less the answer to the mystery at its core that makes it interesting and more the charming, intriguing characters whose motivations and backstories you're watching untangle. I have a special soft spot for well written dialogue and Detective Grimoire delivers that in spades, accompanied by fantastic voice acting that makes the characters come alive. Bonus points for a dialogue system that expects you to pay attention when interviewing suspects, allowing you to become even more immersed in the game world. In fact not only the characters but the whole "Boggy's Bog" you are walking around in feels alive, thanks to some adorable art and an atmospheric soundtrack. I thoroughly enjoyed the lovingly hand-painted backdrops and all the neat animation details.\n\nThe Mediocre: Gameplay, PuzzlesMy own expectations aside, the gameplay is not bad per se. The fact that it is so streamlined may make the game feel too easy (for me), but one could claim that it also helps in allowing you to become engrossed in the game's story. Still, the puzzles are simplistic and many gameplay elements feel like a missed opportunity. For example, having a suspect screen where you can look through various facts that you have uncovered and tag them as suspicious or not suspicious but then never being allowed to use this mechanic in any meaningful way felt like a real let down. On the other hand, combining your clues into logical claims in order to open up new interrogation opportunities is a much better utilised mechanic, and thus becomes one of the most entertaining gameplay elements. All in all, there are many original ideas here, most of which were sadly not allowed to shine. So come to it expecting to interact with an interesting little mystery, but not to be a real agent of change in this world.\n\nThe endorsementSo there you have it. I was disappointed by this game, and yet I thoroughly enjoyed it. There is no denying its charm. It is a polished and very entertaining experience but it is also less than 3 hours long with no replayability, so gauge your preferred price tag accordingly. I experienced no technical problems, those elsewhere cited bugs seem to have been patched out. And for any achievement hunters amongst you, it is a really easy game to 100%. It gets a full thumbs up from me, it's a good little game despite its flaws and I have not regretted my purchase. But whatever you do, definitely do yourself a favour and go play it's free predecessor.","October 30, 2015","true","2.5"," 38 of 39 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","38","39","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/272600/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","Let's get one thing out of the way first: Detective Grimoire is not the bonafide Professor Layton clone some may have been hoping for. Though it shares a few similarities, and even references the top hat wearing puzzle solver at one point, where Layton focuses heavily on brain teasers and riddles Grimoire is a pure detective game; something akin to an elaborate game of Clue crossed with an adventure game. While I could see developer SFB Games losing some people at this point, Detective Grimoire is actually all the better off for straying away from Nintendo's franchise and carving its own original, highly enjoyable path for itself.\n\nSet in a swamp located in the middle of nowhere, populated by suspicious individuals, and potentially home to a mysterious and brutal creature, a murder takes place. With little to go on, the police turn to Detective Grimoire (whose first name I never did find out), who arrives at the scene of the crime and begins to get to work putting the pieces together of just what occurred the night before.\n\nAnd this is where you come in. When I said this was a pure detective game, I meant it quite fully, as the entire game is broken down to finding clues, questioning suspects, and gathering evidence to eventually track down the culprit. As a result, the actual gameplay is rather simple, and usually involves little more than asking suspect A about clue B to get clue C, and repeat this until you've exhausted what you can get out of who you're questioning.\n\nIt's a bit dull on paper, yes, but what kept me engaged throughout the 3 or so hour story was the brilliant writing, lively character, and dry humor and wit of Grimoire. There is a huge amount of personality in every character, every line of dialog delivered with some truly fantastic voice work leading you one step closer to the final reveal, and the vibrant and wonderfully animated art is just the character on top. The plot itself likely couldn't hold its own among most other whodunits, but the way everything is presented more than makes up for the occasionally straightforward narrative and kept me entertained and guessing right up to the very end.\n\nPerhaps some will miss the puzzles or elaborate plot of other detective games, but I for one found Detective Grimoire's offbeat style, basic but enjoyable sleuthing, and buckets of personality one of the more uniquely enjoyable games I've played all year. It doesn't try to do a whole lot, but focuses its energy where it counts and makes my only real disappointment being there is not more of it. Thankfully, if what is hinted at after the credits becomes a reality we'll be seeing more of this detective soon, and that's definitely something to look forward to.\n\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","August 24, 2014","true","3.4"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cinnamongingerpops/recommended/272600/","cinnamongingerpops","Mizuno","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cinnamongingerpops/","524 products in account","First, the pros:\n\nThe game has lovely graphics and animation (but if you know SFB you expected that), quality voice acting and is obviously made with love and care. The characters are interesting and charismatic, not your run-of-the-mill lifeless cookie-cutter supporting characters. The conversation options might not be all that hilarious but they should at least make you smile. The mystery itself is not obvious at all from the beginning, there's some complexity to it, the writing is pretty decent. All good up to this point.\n\nThe main reason I advise you not to purchase this game is simple: the difficulty is next to none, it is almost an insult to our collective intelligence. 'Almost' because at least at the ending you have to consider a few pieces of evidence at the same time to find the culprit, aside from that the game poses no challenge whatsoever. The puzzles are so easy they seem aimed to very young children - except they couldn't possibly be able to consider so many pieces of info as you are supposed to at the end - plus there are some violent themes and graphic grizzly sounds (nothing visual though) so it is definitely not a game that should be aimed at little kids either. I am unsure what the target audience of this game is, to be honest, and that's my biggest bone to pick with it. There are hardly any puzzles anyway, and you'll spend most of the time talking to the same characters over and over and presenting the same clues and profiles - hint: they won't have anything to say about them 80% of the time - so on top of the non-existant difficulty, it can get extremely repetitive despite its short duration.\n\nI really, really wanted to love this game because I've been an SFB fan for way longer than I care to admit, and when I could finally pick up Detective Grimoire I expected something much more well-rounded. I am disappointed as you have gathered already from my review. There's too much hype about this game, and I'm sure there are many more SFB fans like me around here, back from early Newgrounds days, who mean well and are trying to support who they know are very talented guys. But getting the hype about this game up is doing no good to anyone, this game is seriously flawed and I hope they will do some serious work in these weak points if they plan to release a sequel. You can do WAY BETTER and we KNOW IT.\n\nIn conscience, I cannot recommend this game to anyone who isn't very young (but not a kid!), very inexperienced with adventure games and looking for a beginner's experience that poses near no challenge, or someone who is looking for a VERY casual game experience.","February 20, 2015","false","3.4"," 14 of 21 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","14","21","0","0"

Made by a couple dudes who graduated from the Newgrounds school of flash games, DG has quirky characters, good voice acting and a GREAT soundtrack. The story is pretty simple, almost a Scooby Doo story. The owner of a theme park in the middle of a swamp has been murdered and people think it's the work of a swamp monster. Enter you as the titular detective, going around finding clues, questioning suspects and breaking psych-lo....err completing character challenges. The only complain I have is that the game is quite easy. It's also only around 2-3 hours long but since the game's MSRP is 7$, it's not really a problem.\n\nTL;DR Ace Attorney on Steam.","October 13, 2014","true","3.0"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

That's not to say that adults can't enjoy it, but you should know going in that may be purchasing something that was meant more for pre-teens and younger.  Still, it's a cute game and story and worth the effort.

Location and characters are fun and creative, and the setting is family friendly. No bugs or performance issues.

The game has nice graphics and is well-made on the whole, but I just found it way too simple, the story so-so, and the interface and gameplay aimed too much at children. I would only recommend this to kids/teens aged 7-15.\n\nHere's what I liked:+ Mystery to be solved\n+ Pretty, vibrant visuals\n+ Fully voiced\n+ Voice autoplays during conversations, so you can just sit back and let things flow\n+ Good music\n+ High production values\n+ Quite a few trading cards\n\nHere's what I didn't:- Puzzles are way too simple\n- Some puzzles are poorly conceived and have nothing to do with the context\n- Mainly just talking to other characters\n- No object use (i.e. you never have an inventory and never need to use any item)\n- Not a "real" adventure game per se (due to the points mentioned above)\n- Almost all the clues are pieced together by combining words to form a sentence\n- Very kiddish interface\n- Story is dull, uninspired, unoriginal and bland\n- Conclusion is really boring and anti-climactic\n- No satisfaction in solving the mystery\n- Game holds your hand throughout and treats you like you're 5 years old\n\nSome examples of the "puzzles" you will encounter:\n1) Moving objects aside to find what was beneath them. And you are specifically instructed to do so. DUH.\n2) Selecting the correct phrases to form a sentence. E.g. "___ was told to ___ yesterday." And the choices you are given are dead obvious.\n3) Putting the correct pairs together.\n4) Entering the correct code to open a lock, and the code has nothing to do with the lock.\n5) Choosing the correct image to form a clue. E.g. On a diagram of a person hiding in a tent, you must choose a picture (out of 4 choices) that depicts what made him stay in the tent. All the choices other than the correct answer are completely nonsensical.\n6) Putting gears in the correct place to open something.\n7) Choosing the correct string in a tangle.\n8) Matching the correct shape to the keyhole.\n\nConclusionIt's not a bad game, but it's definitely not for the discerning old-school adventure gamer looking for at least some creative & challenging adventure game puzzles to solve. Add to that a really blah story with no drama or excitement whatsoever, and I say give this a miss.","May 31","false","8.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","2"

Nothing other than how the game is controlled has been altered in the Steam port, so any side-puzzles you get involve very simple drag-and-drop solutions. However in my opinion, the game itself is so strong that this lack of puzzle difficulty is more than made up for.\n\nThe standout aspect of Detective Grimoire for me is the story, which is fantastically good fun to the end. Grimoire himself is a briliant character; his humour is part cheese and part charm, with a dash of classic British dryness and a stellar voice actor to boot. But it's not just him - all the other characters have great personalities and voice actors too, and if you do end up buying the game then I strongly suggest not skipping a single bit of dialogue! Every conversation and monologue is hilariously entertaining, and a couple had me in tears from laughing so hard. Other positves I need to mention are the game's stunning, hand-drawn art style and its accompanying soundtrack, both of which are gorgeous and you can tell had great care put into them.\n\nAs for the negatives, from a personal point of view I can't list many. Detective Grimoire doesn't come with the usual roster of bugs, trial-and-error item combinations, pixel hunting and bad voice acting that I'm used to from the adventure genre - the technical aspects of the game are flawless. However if you prefer skill and difficulty in an adventure game over a good story, then Detective Grimoire will probably let you down. Little hint icons make clue-hunting fairly straightforward (although these can be turned off to make the game harder), and if you don't do well questioning a suspect you can try again as many times as you like. However, I personally had no problem with any of this as I picked up the game well aware that it was originally intended for mobile.\n\nTL;DR:  Detective Grimoire is a gorgeous little gem of a game which I simply cannot recommend enough, and its polished finesse and fluid storytelliing make this a must-play for any fan of the adventure game genre. The adorable art style and lack of difficulty also make it a perfect introduction to the world of point-and-click gaming for younger players.

I buy a lot of adventure games.\n\n...and this is the first one I've enjoyed playing. The high points for me are what's not there:\n- You will never need to watch a character walk.\n- All the cutscenes are skippable and most are repeatable if you miss something.\n- Movement is instant. Click on the map location you want and your character is instantly there.\n\nAll the puzzles are trivially easy, and the gameplay itself mainly consists of dialog trees. You click on all the dialog options in order while the game tells you its story. This is a good thing, though.

It was more interesting than I originally assumed it would be, considering the price (well, I got it on sale...). As negative traits, I must say it's quite short (you can finish it in three hours or less, finding every clue and getting every achievement) and the puzzles are ridiculously simple. I would even think it's cool for children (well, yeah, there's a murder, but you don't even see the corpse or even blood, but I don't mean 3 y/o kids... well I don't know).\n\nThings I liked about this game:\n* Artwork. I liked the cartoonish style. It was simple and nice. It conveyed very basic body language (well, facial actually) in a humorous way. The atmosphere is very well achieved.\n* Dialogs. The scripts were rather humorous, dynamic and very well acted. I liked the different choices in dialog, even though they don't always affect the outcome of the interrogation (but sometimes they do). Little objection: it can become incredibly annoying to click "not suspicious" on all the clues of one character, because the guy keeps saying it over and over, but I guess it doesn't matter if you don't do them all at the same time.\n* Sounds. The environmental sounds were great, not too overwhelming that they became annoying. The music was one of the best I heard in this kind of games. It reminded me strongly to the style of Danny Elfman music, and it was a perfect fit for the atmosphere of this game.\n\nI can recommend this cute little game, especially if on sale, as a lovely way of spending a couple of hours.

I have to say i've just found it. Detective Grimoire is one of the games i will definitely recommend to anyone who wants nice detective game :)\n\nFirst of all, menu is simple and functional, nothing special, you can just adjust sound there and maybe switch to windowed mode i think. Main character, detective Grimoire is funny guy, with great dialogues. At the beginning, some officer will introduce you into the case. After that, whole "island" in marshes is yours. You can go anywhere, click on anything, talk to anybody, collect items, just everything to solve the murder. There are also some simple puzzles to solve and also challenges for every person you meet. I think that the game itself is not that hard, you can finish it in 3 hours with all achievements, you can also receive trading cards. Soundtrack is also nice, and there is an option to purchase it, if you want. Different voice actors, who did their job really well, dialogues are awesome thanks to them. The only negative thing is maybe controls. It's a Point&Click game, so you can do everything with only mouse, but. If you want to go from one scene to another, you have to "switch" the controls between "exploration mode" and "movement mode". In one mode you can click on everything and Grimoire will interact with it, in other mode you can just move from scene to scene. Not really negative thing, it just needs time to get used to it. I can't remember any other point&click adventure with same controls.\n\nSo, is it worth 7€? I would say yes, even when playtime is really around 3 hours. But that soundtrack, those characters, that art, beautiful environments. This game really surpised me, and i am glad i've bought it. And actually it is "Overwhelmingly Positive" on Steam, so i am surely not the only one with similar opinion :) But of course, price can be maybe higher for somebody, but there are sales sometimes :) I would recommend to buy it for full price, as there is "mentioned" in the game, that maybe sequel will come :) And i really hope it will.","January 8","true","5.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The game has a few minor gameplay issues, but nothing that took away the entertainment and feeling of immersion in play. It offers a rather detailed interface that can be intimidating at first, but each tool is important to your ability to solve the crime. I go into detail about the interface features more in my video review.\n\n\nThis is a traditional point and click detective adventure that I am pleased to report focuses more on the investigative and detective aspects of the game rather than flooding you with puzzles that can take away from your immersion into your case. The items you acquire are clues that tie together to help you figure out who the murderer is. You aren't running around the map on a wild scavenger quest.  This game is one of the few that actually does the 'detective' aspect right. It isn't too complicated, and fairly straightforward, but it synergizes with itself well.\n\nIt does have some comedic elements, but nothing that will have you rolling in the aisles. It doesn't take itself too seriously, but it does so just enough to relay the gravity of solving a murder.  At the end of the day, this was a very enjoyable game. It has a solid story and solid gameplay, with a well put together detective interface and mechanics. There are a few minor performance issues, but nothing that would ruin your experience. The music is fitting, the voice acting is well done, and it is a well put together detective story.\n\nThanks for your viewership and support; for more videos click here.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/SocioPsycho","January 17","true","4.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The art style is very lovely and just plain oozes charm. The voice acting was surprisingly good, and the story over all was an enjoyable short ride. This game is also rather "family friendly" so don't expect any gut wrenching crimes.\n\n(MILD SPOILER...I THINK)\n\n\nWhen i finished the game, the story said it was to be continued, so theres gonna be (hopefully) more games in this series.

The plot was also believable and a lot of evidence made sense along with the suspects. 10/10\n\nGraphics: The graphic cartoony design instilled into this was pretty good, and the characters all feel well instilled into this world. Plus I LOVE THE ANIMATION CUTSCENES, this was perfect 10/10\n\nGameplay: The controls and inventory system are very simplistic, heck you just need your trusty mouse to play the whole game! You have two ways of going at it in this game, looking at things and walking around, also you have fun little mini-games and can of course talk to suspects and show them evidence and interrogate them. I would warn people though that this game is very easy to beat so don't expect it to be long. 9.5/10\n\nOverall: This was one of the best adventure games I've ever played, it's got great voice acting, good cartoony graphic's and a good length (seriously I thought I could beat this in an hour but it took me 4) so if you can please buy this game, it's totally worth it. 10/10\n\nRecommended price to buy: FULL PRICE!","April 11, 2015","true","2.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","2"

It may be closer of being a Flash cartoon, but it’s a really excellent one at that.\n\nLong version:Detective Grimoire is the sequel of a 2007 freeware Flash game under the same name (but different content), made originally for tablets (the game even asks you to “tap” with the mouse all the time).\nStrictly speaking it falls under the point ‘n’ click adventure genre, but in reality it’s more of an interactive adventure cartoon with a roughly two hour run time as it offers no actual difficulty.\n\nBut it’s all inconsequential, since Detective Grimoire is a wonderful all-age murder mystery with a good plot, memorable characters, entertaining dialogues and excellent voice actors. Although the swamp setting and environmentalist messages can get a little overbearing sometimes.\nAs a detective story it has next to no replay value: once you wrap up the crime, this was it. Still, it’s priced similarly as a movie ticket, and it sure is a lot more entertaining than most movies you may watch.","March 30, 2015","true","2.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/janusan89/recommended/272600/","janusan89","Archangel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/janusan89/","270 products in account","Short Review:\n\nA nice investigation "point & click" game with high quality voice acting behind it and very detail animations, with a very unique style that reminds of Professor Layton, Zelda Windwaker, and old-style cartoons of the 50s. If anything, the game lacks depth and it's rather too short, and the final part of the game is very disappointing since it does everything for you.\nWorth a check, considering the low price point.\n\nLong Review:\n\nDetective Grimoire is technically the second game of the series, with the first being released as a free flash game on their site (which is still pretty good in my opinion! Give it a check!). However, with this game they did a HUGE leap of quality, adding a ton of stuff that the original game didn't have, such as voice acting (A LOT of voice acting) better animation, different art style and more complex puzzles (but not as complex as they should be really).\n\nInitially released for portables such as iPads and what not, I was anticipating this game for a long time, as I loved the original DG for being quite interesting, and the character is actually very likeable and very funny; what we have here is basically a port that didn't suffer from it and still maintains its core mechanics, such as the "theory-maker" thingie.\nIf anything, the resolution cannot be changed, and the volume is at max by default: little nitpicks, so nothing to worry about.\n\nThe game itself is splendidly made: dialogues are fun to follow and don't drag too much, as they flow very fast and I rarely skipped the dialogues, since they were very interesting and very funny (especially Grimoire: he really tells a lot of stupid things. Oh, and they made the hat joke again!). The puzzles are ok, but just too easy to follow: the real challenge at times is the Theory-making part, since at times you'll put the wrong statement...but at the same time, it's a lot of fun to mess up those, making him say the dumbest thing ever. The game is fluid and has also animated cutscenes as well, and the characters are...okay, for the most part.\n\nHowever, there are some issues in my opinion: for one, the story is good, but the last part is a joke: you do nothing at all when you catch the culprit, and that's a huge disappointment considering that the first game, a flash game, had a far more complicated part where you EVEN have to guess who did it. In here, he picks it up for you.\nThe game is also too easy: you really can't fail anything at all, and as soon as you get your clues you can just spam them to the suspects and see their reaction...and Grimoire even tells you "when it's time to go". They also gave you the possibility to see if something is suspect or not on a culprit, but it's completely useless and serves no purpose: it's just there for letting you  check your progress to catch the culprit. And let's face it, you'll guess who it is pretty soon.\n\nI honestly hoped the game to be more intriguing: the art is amazing and the game is very fun, but the story behind is disappointing and lacks to be intriguing, which is a huge problem for me.\nStill, I do recommend this game, because it's always good to have nice adventure games and the game is still VERY well done.\nAvoid it if you don't care about investigation, reading, or point and click adventures in general.","August 18, 2014","true","2.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

As Detective Grimoire, you must gather evidence to discover how and why the murder was committed, and then interrogate people to learn facts about them, which will help you to work out which one is the murderer.\n\nThe game is simple to pick up, and fun to play. In particular I enjoyed the "challenge" mechanic, which allows you to quiz each suspect on a key topic and use evidence to get the truth out of them. This mechanic was reminiscent of the Phoenix Wright games for Nintendo DS. The puzzles were very simple, but in a way it was nice to play the game and enjoy the story without getting stuck on complicated puzzles.\n\nThe story was fun, and the characters were entertaining and well-acted. My only criticism is that it is a very short game (about 2 hours long), which would be fine as the first episode in a multi-part series, but as a standalone game it does leave you feeling unsatisfied. The game could easily be extended to include more than one case, and hopefully the developers will do so in the future.\n\nThe graphics in my opinion were fine, a very simple 2D cartoony style, but I imagine that some people would find the style very ugly and it would put them off the game. I would encourage them to look past the graphics and try to enjoy the game for the story and gameplay. One thing I did notice about the graphics is everything was very large, as if it was a mobile phone game stretched to fill a full-sized screen.  But this didn't interfere with enjoyment of the game in any way.\n\nOverall, I would heartily recommend this game if it is on sale. But due to its unsatisfactory length, I would not recommend paying full price.  I would say the game is suitable for ages 8 and up (despite the murder theme, there is no violence or gore).","January 2","true","3.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The dialogue had that awesome Phoenix Wright sarcasm going for it which is always excellent. I loved the puzzles and sentence-makings. It really kept your attention on what exactly was going on instead of people just playing and figuring it all out near the end. It really made you think for yourself in that sense.\n\nSo, yes.

Though a bit on the short side (it runs about 2 hours) it's jam packed with detail that makes it a great quick play. The story is original, the cast quirky and fun. But the best part is you really feel like you're being a detective as you gather clues and observe everything and I mean EVERYTHING. To get a complete in this game you must leave no stone unturned quite literaly. You never know where a clue will be or just a fun throw away joke. Surpisingly for such a straightfoward game there is a lot of replay value if you ever want to just have a cute pick me up.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/altered_confusion/recommended/272600/","altered_confusion","Altered_Confusion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/altered_confusion/","289 products in account","In this exciting detective adventure game filled with twists and turns, by SFB Games, you will find yourself playing the role of Detective Grimoire. Your job is to take on the mysterious death of Remington, the owner of a swamp amusement park in the far reaches of a swamp. The odd thing is that the apparent killer is the infamous Boggy, a creature so unique that it hasn't been seen in 60 years, and yet came out of hiding to kill the man that created a park about the creature itself.\n\nGraphically I loved the look of the game, the characters all had a very different look to them, and the different sections of the "park" definitely went with the vibe of what was going on in the scene. All the screens are static back drops, and some of them have characters that will appear somewhere in the foreground. There was just something about the character design that just draws a person in, I can't tell if it was the way that they were drawn, or if it is the use of colors, but whatever it is, it works for the game. I also really liked the HUD layout of the game, you definitely new where you were in the game, in terms of progress, as well as where you stood with the different characters that you would be interviewing as you try to track down the killer.\n\nOne of the biggest things that I have found makes or breaks the game is the voices and sounds of the game. This particular game nailed it. Along with the look of the characters I could feel the voices breath life into them. Each was very unique and each made me believe that those voices belonged to those characters. I also really appreciated the humorous dialogue that was thrown in from time to time to keep things a little lighter in the game.\n\nThe controls are really simple, this is another point and click game. So as long as you feel confident left clicking with a mouse, you'll do just fine.\n\nAlright so lets get down to it, as I stated before you will be playing the role of Detective Grimoire. You have been asked to consult in this truly bizarre death which everyone is claiming was done by an almost mythical creature that has not been seen in 60 years. It is your job to interview everyone on the island and try to uncover all the truths, lies, and obstacles that get in your way. My only problem with the game was that the overall length wasn't all that long, but there was something about this game that I didn't really care. I enjoyed it for what it was, and that was a great story, with a great cast of characters, and surprises spread throughout. I also enjoy the interrogation mechanic that was in the game. There was always a chance that some new bit of information or perhaps an actual clue could get more information out of the different individuals spread out across this very unique theme park.\n\nNow I'd like to go more into some of the twists and turns, but that would be a terrible thing to give away for anyone out there wanting to play the game, and I think most will want to play this game. So if you like point and click mysteries with colorful casts, and a very mysterious murder, this is the game for you. You can beat the game in under 2 hours, that's the only thing that I want to warn you about, but outside of that I think most will greatly enjoy the time they spend playing this game. This game gets an 8.8 out of 10.","October 9, 2014","true","2.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's quite short, but that's completely ok if you are looking for a game that doesn't ask you for tens of hours of play in order to get to the end.\nOne small tip: even when the game directs you to get back to the entrance to finally solve the case, do so only once you've uncovered all the tips. It makes quite more sense then that you can get certain conclusions (especially about who the culprit is!!) rather than getting in there with just the bare minimum of the hints.","October 25, 2014","true","3.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Still, the plot is nice, I really enjoyed the graphs and sound effects, the game has some dark and ironic sense of humor that most adults will enjoy. I foun dthe voice acting extremely good.\nYou can add some challenge by turning off the shining hints, an dyou can walk around the game areas in any order you want, which gives you a sense of freedom. The fact that after the game you can still go back to look for the stuff you missed in order to get 100% of suspects/clues/notes was a plus for me, as it gave me the excuse to go back and enjoy Detective Grimoire ´s world without having to go through all the game again.\nMy main complaint is that the game was too short, but with the simple "case" involved it would have been harder to extend the playing time without making it boring. If the developers´ idea was to leave you wanting for more, they succeeded with me, as I will be definitely checking out for other Detective Grimoire games. I got this one in a bundle so I´m not sure what is its regular price keeping in mind it is so short, but in the worst case scenario other DG games will be on my wish list should other bundles or sales include them.","March 14, 2015","true","3.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I played this game with my boyfriend last night and we both often found ourselves smiling at the game: It has a lovely style of art, and very, very charming characters. The voice acting is great, the dialogues are great, and the protagonist is a charming, slightly sarcastic, definitly cool character.\n\nThe gameplay had some refreshing mechanics to it in my opinion, letting you form thoughts that you probably already figured in your head. That really allowed you to stay on top of things and for once incooperate what you thought into the game - something most detective games don't do. You sit there thinking you figured it all out, but you can never tell anyone, well, this game tries to change that up a little.\n\nThe puzzles were all quite easy, and the story itself is not hard to understand for any adult. So if you are looking for a challenging game, this will probably not be for you. It is also relatively short, with a playtime of maybe two hours, and whilst it is entertaining for that duration it will probably not have any replay value for some time.\n\nI would gladly hand this game to a child, because the puzzles and the story will be absolutely appropriate for them. The art style and characters would simply charm them, and I remember playing games like this in my past and loving them with all my heart, because to me they were still mysterious and unpredictable when I was still a child.\n\nFor adults? Not challenging, nothing too iconic - if you are someone who enjoys games aiming at a younger audience, this game is great. If you want something more adult and complex, I would not recommend this game.\n\nOverall I really enjoyed it for its playful and childlike charm.

It, for me at least, had about 2 hours of gameplay which isn't a massive amount. The puzzles are just too simple and require very little effort, the system that lets you judge whether something one of the suspects did was suspicious or not is pointless and the murderer was a little too obvious to me.  Putting these points aside the game is still very enjoyable and worth playing. I would say that this game is directed at a younger audience however there is nothing stopping older people playing it.

I'd write a couple paragraphs, but no one comes to steam reviews to actually read, so heres a pros and cons list\n\nPros:\n-Neat, unique artstyle, with likable characters. At first I was a little put off by the hyper pale/caricature style as opposed to the more realistic style of the flash game, but I ended up liking it, and it seems more suited to this type of game.\n\n-A fun story that is easy to pick up and quirky but still staying realistic-ish. A little bit more scooby doo and less serious than the old one, but again, in a way that seems fitting to what they're going for.\n\n-Really good for any age. Not even in a "Fun for the whole family!" way, but just seems like something you could enjoy at 50 years old or 10 years old.\n\n-Always mixes up the current task. You're never interrogating for too long before being given a puzzle, or given too many questions without answers.\n\nNeutral:\n-Puzzles are never super hard. This isn't a "Puzzle game" in any sense I'd say. You're never going to have to look up a guide or feel cheated by not getting something, they're mostly just to to mix things up here and there. Personally I appreciate this, because im generally a dumbass with that kind of stuff.\n\n-It took me maybe two and a half hours to complete with 100% completion. However, this is good because it really does feel like something you should do in one sitting. Its the price of a movie ticket for whats more or less an interactive movie.\n\n-The big whodunnit is more or less easy to tell just from intuition, and after going around and talking to everyone once you'll probably have a solid idea of who you're accusing, and the rest is just getting your evidence together. Again, this is great for a younger audience or just for an "Easy riding" type of game, but it does feel you can process of elimination it out very quickly.\n\nCons:\n-There may be parts more near the end of the game that you feel you're shoving 20+ pieces of evidence to *Every* character just in case they have something to say on it.\n\n-The cut-scene like scenes shown in the trailer arent present in the actual game. Though characters still move through different poses as you talk to them.\n\n-There are two ending cinematics (though the latter is mostly just text) that feel a bit awkward and out of theme to the rest of the story. Maybe its just my opinion.\n\n-Theres no replay value other than just going through it again, but what did you expect?\n\nGeneral: If you liked the first flash game, detective style games, or even just more narrative focused games I'd say its definitely worth the pick up. Could it be 2 dollars cheaper? Sure, but I think it was a good experience and worth it for a rainy day for sure.","April 3, 2015","true","2.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/altered_confusion/recommended/272600/","altered_confusion","Altered_Confusion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/altered_confusion/","289 products in account","In this exciting detective adventure game filled with twists and turns, by SFB Games, you will find yourself playing the role of Detective Grimoire. Your job is to take on the mysterious death of Remington, the owner of a swamp amusement park in the far reaches of a swamp. The odd thing is that the apparent killer is the infamous Boggy, a creature so unique that it hasn't been seen in 60 years, and yet came out of hiding to kill the man that created a park about the creature itself.\n\nGraphically I loved the look of the game, the characters all had a very different look to them, and the different sections of the "park" definitely went with the vibe of what was going on in the scene. All the screens are static back drops, and some of them have characters that will appear somewhere in the foreground. There was just something about the character design that just draws a person in, I can't tell if it was the way that they were drawn, or if it is the use of colors, but whatever it is, it works for the game. I also really liked the HUD layout of the game, you definitely new where you were in the game, in terms of progress, as well as where you stood with the different characters that you would be interviewing as you try to track down the killer.\n\nOne of the biggest things that I have found makes or breaks the game is the voices and sounds of the game. This particular game nailed it. Along with the look of the characters I could feel the voices breath life into them. Each was very unique and each made me believe that those voices belonged to those characters. I also really appreciated the humorous dialogue that was thrown in from time to time to keep things a little lighter in the game.\n\nThe controls are really simple, this is another point and click game. So as long as you feel confident left clicking with a mouse, you'll do just fine.\n\nAlright so lets get down to it, as I stated before you will be playing the role of Detective Grimoire. You have been asked to consult in this truly bizarre death which everyone is claiming was done by an almost mythical creature that has not been seen in 60 years. It is your job to interview everyone on the island and try to uncover all the truths, lies, and obstacles that get in your way. My only problem with the game was that the overall length wasn't all that long, but there was something about this game that I didn't really care. I enjoyed it for what it was, and that was a great story, with a great cast of characters, and surprises spread throughout. I also enjoy the interrogation mechanic that was in the game. There was always a chance that some new bit of information or perhaps an actual clue could get more information out of the different individuals spread out across this very unique theme park.\n\nNow I'd like to go more into some of the twists and turns, but that would be a terrible thing to give away for anyone out there wanting to play the game, and I think most will want to play this game. So if you like point and click mysteries with colorful casts, and a very mysterious murder, this is the game for you. You can beat the game in under 2 hours, that's the only thing that I want to warn you about, but outside of that I think most will greatly enjoy the time they spend playing this game. This game gets an 8.8 out of 10.","October 9, 2014","true","2.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If the developers´ idea was to leave you wanting for more, they succeeded with me, as I will be definitely checking out for other Detective Grimoire games. I got this one in a bundle so I´m not sure what is its regular price keeping in mind it is so short, but in the worst case scenario other DG games will be on my wish list should other bundles or sales include them.","March 14, 2015","true","3.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I played this game with my boyfriend last night and we both often found ourselves smiling at the game: It has a lovely style of art, and very, very charming characters. The voice acting is great, the dialogues are great, and the protagonist is a charming, slightly sarcastic, definitly cool character.\n\nThe gameplay had some refreshing mechanics to it in my opinion, letting you form thoughts that you probably already figured in your head. That really allowed you to stay on top of things and for once incooperate what you thought into the game - something most detective games don't do. You sit there thinking you figured it all out, but you can never tell anyone, well, this game tries to change that up a little.\n\nThe puzzles were all quite easy, and the story itself is not hard to understand for any adult. So if you are looking for a challenging game, this will probably not be for you. It is also relatively short, with a playtime of maybe two hours, and whilst it is entertaining for that duration it will probably not have any replay value for some time.\n\nI would gladly hand this game to a child, because the puzzles and the story will be absolutely appropriate for them. The art style and characters would simply charm them, and I remember playing games like this in my past and loving them with all my heart, because to me they were still mysterious and unpredictable when I was still a child.\n\nFor adults? Not challenging, nothing too iconic - if you are someone who enjoys games aiming at a younger audience, this game is great. If you want something more adult and complex, I would not recommend this game.\n\nOverall I really enjoyed it for its playful and childlike charm. If you ever got 5 quid to spend, I think this is a good purchase.","February 21, 2015","true","2.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game's soundtrack was wonderful and there was plenty of ambiance within the game itself. The artwork was splendid and I loved the style, it really matched the humor of the characters. The jokes were also my cup of tea. The animation was fluid and added to the style of the game. It got a bit repetitive as you're clicking around looking for clues, and so I wish there was a way to turn off the voiceover, though there might have been and I just missed it. The interface for the suspect profiles is a bit tedious to work around, but I thought it was very cute. The voice acting was rather fitting of all of the characters and I really enjoyed hearing it whenever they weren't repeating lines. The timing was perfect, and was fitting of a detective game, leading you to be suspicious of certain things people say. I did think that the culprit was easy to figure out, and I felt like the game could have made it a bit more difficult, thus also lengthening it. All in all, I thought it was a good game, and definitely worth a buy.\n\nPROS:\n+ Cute art style\n+ Fluid animations\n+ Subtle Humor\n+ Ambiance/Good timing\n+ Soundtrack\n+ Voiceovers were really cute and well done\n+ Boggy merch\n+ Side puzzles\n+ Grimoire's notebook\n\nCONS:\n- Short\n- Easy/not very challenging\n- Lines get repetitive\n- Voiceover is sometimes annoying\n- Lots of random clicking\n\nTl;dr Short, easy, quirky, and cute","December 25, 2015","true","2.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The visuals are gorgeous.\n- The voice acting is soothing. Yes, soothing. If you ever get stuck, you'll hear the characters repeat their lines again and again, but it's okay, because it's relaxing.\n- Easily unlockable Locked Doors. A single easy puzzle on a door is better than running around looking for items you might have missed to interact with it.\n- A map to get to places. You can't get lost, and you don't have to watch your character run around for ages. Going from A to B is as easy as clicking on B.\n- Deducing stuff (unlocking challenges) is intuitive, straightforward, and if you don't understand what you're supposed to deduce, just try and the game will eventually hint you in the right direction with clever commentary from Grimoire.\n\nWhat I don't like with it?\n- A tad too simple for my own taste.\n- It's short.","April 3","true","3.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

My only problem is that I want more. This is like a short demonstration of the game mechanism and style for a detective themed click-and-point adventure, in lieu of building the "full adventure". In terms of these features, it could be compared to LA Noire, but Discworld Noir still had more innovation, such as combining clues and notes and objects to make deductions. Detective Grimoire could be said to build on this, but in a very limited way, by the use of a selection of combining phrases to choose from in order to craft a deduction. But, as I said, this was specialized/tailored to each specific situation rather than a generalised mechanism (plus a limited selection of topics rather than all the available clues/notes, although that limitation does make it more streamlined). So, there is room for improvement maybe.","April 5","true","4.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is a engaging game, it is a boring game. Yet what does that mean?\n\nThe game involves you questioning subjects and looking around crime scenes for clues. You can question subjects about one of four topics, ask them about another character, or about an object in an inventory. Get enough clues and you get a special interrogation section with a character that plays out like a memory game, if you can remember the details, you will recieve an extra clue. Get even more clues after that and you will play a matching game that allows you to also recieve an additional clue. All to discover the solution to the mystery. Forgot details? Don't worry every single clue is written down for your convenience. There are even a few puzzles like trying to open a door available as well, but these are trivial.\n\nOn the possitive aspects Detective Grimoire is a creative game with bright vibrant characters with voice acting and animation that instantly brings them to life in a way few games ever achieve. The world is quite fleshed out and mildly interesting as well as a tourist attraction in a swamp feels like a place that really could exist. The game is very intuitive and discovering who the criminal is stems naturally from the clues given to the extent where you could solve the case in your head without the need for sudden reveals.\n\nThe negative aspect of the game can be summed up as busy work. There is an old saying that in adventure games when you get stuck you need to use everything on everything else. Detective Grimoire is a game based around using everything on everything else and unfortunately in some cases it is what you genuinely need to do. You will sometimes find yourself bringing up every item and suspect to every single character... Now you might think to yourself "But divulging that I am onto the criminal might scare them away or put me in danger." Not so in Detective Grimoire, you can bring up all the evidence you need to catch the criminal to the criminal and they won't even bat an eye. Essentially making this feel like a large game of "busy work" instead of a full blown detective game. It is also a bit on the short side.\n\nDifficulty wise the game is easy. Hints are on by default, essentially it will give you solutions, and even with them off occasionally the hints they give in the game should entirely give the puzzle away. There is no game overs and the game even has a system to tell you when you missed something. If you think Telltale point and clicks are too hard, this game is for you.\n\nThis game confuses me because on paper I should dislike the game because it is incredibly easy and ultimately requires no real problem solving... Yet I actually like the game because of its atmosphere, voice acting, and world building as well as the characters that inhabit it. It helps that it is priced quite fairly.\n\nI give this a 8/10\n\nBy the by, those 3 hours on record? I beat the game in that time, and probably could have done it faster.","August 20, 2014","true","2.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","1"

Well, here's something: It's okay.\n\nI first stumbled upon the game on Kongregate, some time before the sequel (this game) was announced. I remember thinking "this was really fun!". It wasn't something huge or ground-breaking, but it was a pretty cool little gem. And, to be fair, it's not trying to be grand, and I can respect that. It's not the issue I have with this game. This game is much of the same. The story is fine, the gameplay is pretty standard, but the art is definitely eyecandy.\n\nSo here's the story: You are detective Grimoire, and you've been called out to a swamp, to investigate a murder in a tourist attraction. The supposed killer is the mascot on which the attraction was built: a swamp monster. You meet a cast of colorful characters, note in your pad who is suspicious and who isn't, go over the evidence and play a silly flash game from the early 2000's until the murderer is finally caught.\n\nSo what are the good things? Well, characters and voice-acting. Both are really good, and I can't really point out many places that broke immersion (there is ONE, but we'll get to that). Their dialogue is fun and interesting, and breaking their safeguards on certain points is pretty satisfying because they keep denying or outright fighting you on the subject. The art, of course, is beautiful and colorful (much more interesting to the eye might I add, which begs the question: why are none of the triple-A companies taking advantage of more colors in their games?).\n\nUnfortunately, there were quite a few things I disliked about this game. The little girl character is more or less there because she was in the first game (like, really, she gives you a map and pleads for you not to arrest the swamp monster). The aforementioned flash game from the early 2000's really stands out from the rest of the game style-wise (and in early 2000's flash game fashion, the sounds are really loud). The setting is almost the same as the first game. The ending is pretty weak (first gave us a psychotic freak-out, this one has mythical monsters), and the section leading up to it is so straight forward, it almost crumbles the rest of the cookie. See, whether or not you note one of your suspects as the only suspect, you will be pointed to the actual murderer so long as you take the right dialogue choices in the first part of fetching the murderer. So if you thought that wormy guy was the murderer, whoops! Looks like it was this other guy all along! The only difficult part of the game is finding all the clues and details, which really chips down in hindsight.\n\nThen, who finally catches the murderer? What ending is this totally okay game bestowing upon us? The swamp monster. Honestly, I wasn't even angry. I was disappointed. This is a game that seems like it could be centered around our world, one that never hinted to a supernatural element (apart from the witch who turned out to be a herbalist, which I guess is witchcraft to the uninitiated), and yet here they spring an actual monster on us. I was really disappointed, because this could have been my scooby doo (there's no such thing as monsters and the whole kahoozie), and I really really REALLY wanted to like this game.\n\nIn a way, though, I want you to give it a try. It's an unrefined gem, dusty and unclear, in need to find its own place in a chunk of ore. There is potential, definitely, but I don't know if the series will continue from here on (though there are characters to grab and hold on to, and the visual style is a five-star lobster dinner to the eye), but as is, it's pretty harmless.","October 20, 2015","true","3.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

But it's just too simplistic, too linear (their jokingly "non-linear" circular map notwithstanding), and too forgiving. The environment often provides too few cues as to where you need to click in order to find the requisite clues, and likewise the topics that will or won't prove helpful when talking to a given suspect are not necessarily intuitive. Basically, just click on every square inch of each scene until, go through every possible conversation topic with every possible person, and you'll complete the game in two hours with zero consequences. I guess that could be construed as "kid-friendly" or something, but ultimately this isn't so much a game as it is a simplistic demonstration of how investigation kind of works. And to round it all out, the voice acting is quite hit-and-miss.\n\nI applaud the idea and the effort, and I hope these guys use it as a springboard for a more ambitious project, but for now I can't call it a worthwhile experience.","November 15, 2015","false","1.7"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"

I can see what the game wanted to be, and it has all the elements to be a great game but falls rather short in the end.\n\nPros:\nVoice Acting\nBackground ArtCons:\nThe plot is rather rudimentary, the 'mystery' isn't that difficult to solve. It feels like a chore to trudge through all the dialogue searching for clues.\nThe "puzzles" can't even really be called puzzles, they are far too simple. The only real puzzle is at the end of the game where you use commons sense to figure things out.\nThere are no consequences to any of your actions/choices so it all seems very pointless.\nThe game practically holds your hand the entire way through, as opposed to letting the player figure things out, i.e). you'll find a clue of some sort and the game immediately launches you into what can be compared to the logic system used in the Phoenix Wright games, this causes the game to feel rather disjointed.\nThe writing isn't terrible but it's not good either, it tries all too hard to be funny and witty.","January 2","false","3.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I really, really did. I saw all the great reviews and I'm a fan of point and click mystery games. I thought it would be awesome.\n\nIt WOULD be awesome. If I was under the age of twelve.\n\nPros:\n+ Stylized Art. Pretty and painterly\n+ Doesn't entirely give away the "bad guy" -- you still have to guess at the end\n+ Voice acting is nice. Some characters more than others\n+ Everyone has a slight motive\n\nCons:\n- Puzzles are either laughingly easy, or stupidly easy to overlook and spend time needlessly running around when you had to click TWO PIXELS over from something you already clicked.\n- Dialogues can be repeated endlessly. There's no real consequences or difficulty. You can't "die" or "lose."\n- The map is annoying to naviagte\n- The voice acting can be horrible at times, and sometimes poorly compressed.\n- Plot line is linear\n\nThe characters are quirky. But that's it. There's no depth, and you don't really care at all about them as people. They're just quirky, one-note characters.\n\nI actually finished 90% of the game without meeting one of the MAIN suspects (and, turns out, the actual perpetrator.) I was obviously supposed to meet said person before this point, but the game did not lead me to this person at all. I was using the map to travel, and jumped right past them. I could not figure out what I was doing wrong, everything was at 100% except a big BLANK spot. Ended up having to look up a guide.\n\nThe rest of the game was just...made for a kid. It's not that difficult, and some of the 'puzzles' are so easy I questioned if I had this game on a weirdly low difficulty level.\n\nRecommend this for your kid's first point-and-click puzzle if they're around 7~12 years old. Otherwise, just skip it.","December 29, 2015","false","3.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Arguably worth the low price of €6.99.\n\nI think the first thing that I really took notice of was the cute artstyle, which really brought back memories of obscure cartoons in my early, early childhood. It was mostly impressive within cutscenes, while in-game it looked a bit stale and clunky at times (incl. during dialogue sequences). But all in all a fairly good artstyle.\n\nThe gameplay is very simplistic point-and-click. Very much just running around the map, clicking on things until you find the solution, as it switched chapters for me twice just going around the map a singular time. It does not make any effort to hide the fact that it was ported over from mobile platforms, as it continuously reminds you to "tap" things instead of "clicking" them. Not that I find it at all hampering to the overall process of playing it.\n\nThe story itself is quite kid-friendly, actually, which I find to be a rather curious matter-of-fact seeing as the case entirely revolves around a murder... which is not all that kid-friendly. Nonetheless, the story did actually grab me in enough to play through the entire two or so hours as I frantically clicked away at things. In the end, a cute little story.\n\nSomething that I should mention is that I, personally, had some weird framerate issues. They mainly occurred after playing for more than half-an-hour or so, and would only affect interactions with objects within the world - but it did not affect the menus, the dialogue or the cutscenes. It might only be me experiencing this, as no one on the forum seems to be complaining about such issues at the time.\n\nSincerely\nCrayt","October 3, 2014","true","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game is almost completely investigating, yet it's better here.  In Detective Grimoire, you investigate a murder.  You examine the area to find clues, speak with witnesses/suspects, and solve some simple puzzles.  Grimoire himself is entertaining to listen to, and most of the other characters get good voice actors.  The one thing that I'd like to see changed about this game is the interrogation scenes.  These are the moments where you're supposed to confront the witness with evidence about what they're hiding from you.  It needs to have some challenge.  If you have the correct evidence, then you probably know what to present already.  You should be forced to consider what the evidence has in relation to this witness.

Basically you are detective Grimoire, who is investigating a murder possibly caused by a supernatural swamp creature. People who are into mystery solving, speaking with the other rpg characters and collecting evdience will pretty much enjoy this games since the majoirty of the time you will be doing that. However, there are a couple small puzzle games that I actually did enjoy, like when you had to arrange your words to create the correct thought to simple arranges. They don't get too annoying, but some might be to easy.\n\nOne of the best thing about this game I attracted to me personally was the art style. What I always love in point and click games are the environment that we get to take our time to explore, which the artist did a beautiful job with. Also the characters are fun to look at, like being in a children books as well as matching the humor with it. All of this is unique and memorable to look at. The artist who is responsible is named Catherine Unger, an animation graduated who also help develop the other Steam game "Haunt the House: Terrortown". Check out her blogspot to see all the artwork she has done before and some of the sketches she created for those games.\n\nOverall, this is a nice relaxing game to bring back the traditional two-dimesional animation, funny dialogue and pleasure exploration. Check it out for yourself to see what I mean.","September 20, 2014","true","7.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I think I completed it in around 2 hours - but the good news is I found myself having a  problem quitting. Loved the athmosphere, loved the characters and voice acting - and very quickly got into how it was played.\n\nI think the perfect playthrough of this would be with my oldest daughter (7 years), even though it is about a murder. Slightly older, english speaking kids (maybe 8-12?) could have a very fun time solving this murder mystery on their own.\n\nOnly negative remark I would have is that I found myself testing a lot of combinations (in dialogue or objects), perhaps out of old habit, which was tedious. I would chalk that up to being my bad actually, if it weren't for the fact that I found 1, maybe 2 wacky combinations that represent the reason why we would do this in older point and click adventures anyway.

Detective Grimoire is a game where you have to investigate scenery and talk to people because someone died. Find out why they died, find out who died them, and observe the sexual tension between some characters. Seriously, anyone who's played Pheonix Wright should feel right at home with this game. However, I cannot say that the game is amazing. It feels disjointed, and somewhat dumbed down. It feels more like an over-simplified version of Pheonix Wright than a standalone title. Despite this, I enjoyed playing it, hearing the lovely sounds of the voice actors read their lines, and the impressive musical score. One of few games where I would reccommend picking up the soundtrack, Detective Grimoire gets a 7.75/10. Thankfully a sequel was teased, so if some improvements were made to make the game more engaging, a better experience could be had. Please pardon my English, I'm tired as hell as of writing.","August 25, 2014","true","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a game that can and likely will be played in a single session, as the simplistic gameplay never becomes overwhelming and the player always find new interesting story details that will encurage them to press on just a little further.\n\nThe story starts as improbable as it gets: Detective Grimoire is send on a murder case that may have been commited by an elusive creature that is the main attaction of a tourist attaction somewhere in the middle of a remote swamp. Strangely enough, Grimoire appears to be the only one confused how such a place can turn any kind of profit and thus begins our strange hunt for clues to unravel this mystery one piece at a time...\n\nYou might be best advised to see this game more along the lines of a visual novel, with a few simple puzzles mixed in to keep your brain running. The only flaw the story has in my opinion is that depending on the order you find the clues and how your brain works, you can make a very sure-fire guess who the culpirt is about half the way into the game. Thankfully, the story surrounding the case is much larger than the game first hints at, kepping you invested the full time it takes to find the last missing piece of evidence to cement the case or to figure out the full story surrounding Boggy's Bog.","February 5, 2015","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This isn't a typical adventure point and click, so if you're looking for an Monkey Island, Broken Sword or Runaway alternative, you probably wont be impressed.\nAnyway, if you're looking for a simple adventure (and by simple i mean that you're probably not going to visit every location more than twice) very cartoonish, with some well animated and well voiced charaters, then Detective Grimoire is a good choice to spend 3 hours of play.\n\nDetective Grimoire is also on IOS, where i personally think has a better interface, and touch controls that gives it something more in fun and gameplay.","February 7, 2015","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I was at first rather sceptical when I picked it up in a bundle, but I decided to give it a try anyway.  Detective Grimoire is a great game to play when you have a couple hour to kill, as it only took about 3 hours to play through completely.  The animation style is enjoyable, and the only real thing that I didn't like about it was that there is no fast way to skip the repetitive dialogue while searching for the last little clues.

From its animated characters, background art and its music; this game is worth playing.\n\nI've tried the first Detective Grimoire game on Newgrounds before, and it was the very reason why I got this game. The first game was modeled after Phoenix Wright (in-game, Grimoire hinted something to this) and this one could be hinted to Professor Layton. Still, you can find the influence of the Wright games in the interrogation sequences(questioning, presenting evidence/profiles, cross-examination) but its the inclusion of the puzzles(though I must admit, the puzzles are very easy to solve, I just love more challenge to my puzzles and this game has none of it. But its not a bad thing mind you, its pacing is designed for easy puzzles to get the story moving.) that make it a mystery/detective game.\n\nThe narrative is very impressive; This seriously gave me some Call of Cthulu vibes. Although, it is kind of lacking in the character development. Can't say anymore since I don't want to spoil a cool story (you'll just have to buy the game and play it for yourself)\n\nThis game stands on its own and in no way a clone of anything else aside from its influences. I am slightly disappointed since I expected the puzzles to be more challenging, most of the time you could just show every single piece of evidence, really its just a diligent point-and-click. I really wish that the developers would hurry the next game since I feel that this has the potential to be a great episodic game.\n\nPro Short game\nLovely Narrative\nGreat character and background art\nCool music\nDidn't expect this to have a voiceover\nCon Short game\nInterrogating the characters could have been fleshed out more.\nEasy Puzzles\nShort game\nOthers Some voice over lines sound lower quality than the rest (putting Overall 4.5/5","February 19, 2015","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Grimoire is the second in the series, the original being available on the Newgrounds website, although the game doesn't hold many throwbacks to that game, aside from one remark, so it isn't ultimately necessary to play in order to enjoy this game, although  still whole heartedly recommended.\n\nDetective Grimoire details the story of the titular character's attempts to solve the mystery of the death of an attraction within an unusual place, and his main suspect is the tourist attraction's prominent star - Boggy, a creature that nobody has seen in decades. The Detective has been called to this murky bog in order to solve this mystery. While finding his misplaced hat, preferably.\n\nFirst thing first - there is no doubt that Detective Grimoire is an excellent game, and with the price I spent on it, I was pretty satisfied. However, the issue I mainly had for this  game was the puzzles, and the overall difficulty is a bit lacking. The puzzles that arised were very simplistic, and the game never really presented much of a challenge. Aside from that, I really did enjoy everything else. Unraveling the mystery of the swamp was very irritating, and the presentation of the bog was excellent, both in terms of art and sound. The humour in the game was also very amusing, and I must admit, I did find myself having a bit of a childish giggle at Grimoire's thought puzzle sections.\n\nDetective Grimoire is definitely something people should check out, and, as a huge fan of SFB Games, I look forward to what they produce next!","August 23, 2014","true","5.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Like the chemistry test mini-game having only three obivious objects to pick from... and you have to do it three times.  Still, I did enjoy the sentence-construction puzzles. Those were fun and again, the main entertainment is learning about all the characters.\n\nHighly recomended!","September 7, 2014","true","3.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I had completed the game 100% (no assistance or guides ) in one sitting and I love the game for what it is, but it must be stated that for anyone expecting a challenging struggle of determining who's the culprit in this murder-mystery game you will surely disappointed.\n\nPros:\n-The Music: It's pretty damn good albeit a little repetitive due to its looping nature. The composer is Raphael B. Meyer, I -believe.\n-Art Style: Yeah, it's great mate.\n-Absurd Humor: There's too many moments to accurately describe.\n-Voice Acting: "Egoraptor" , "Omahdon" and several others pitched in to help with the voice acting. Needless to say, it's good.\n\nCons:\n- A very lackluster murder-mystery to painfully honest\n-Ludicrously easy puzzles so facile that they might as well not exist in the game.\n-The culprit is as obvious as can possibly be without blatantly screaming, "Hey, I'm the killer."\n\nWhen it comes down to it, despite this game having a disappointing detective aspect to it, the music, atmosphere and art style continues to draw me in and makes me want to recommend this game. If one does want to experience this game, experience it for the humor and all things EXCEPT the crime solving.","May 15, 2015","true","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So you can just present everthing to everyone and that's it.\n- I really didn't understand (nor I used except to get the achievement) the "suspicious/unsuspicious" system. I don't get the point.\n- Swamp monster thing, really? I understand it's probably a reference to Scooby-Doo, but the story is kind of lazy sometimes.\n\nAnyway, it's still an excellent game and I enjoyed it a lot. Too short, I want more! ;-)","February 28","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The art style and animation is gorgeous (even though I wish that the cutscenes were higher resolution than they are, although that probably stems from the fact the game was originally designed for mobile devices), and the voice acting is really good as well, featuring some well-known people such as Joshua "Jaxamoto" Tomar and Arin "Egoraptor" Hanson. It's about 2 hours in length, so you might want to wait for a sale, although I would say that it is still worth it's £5 price tag :)","September 3, 2014","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game is charming but it feels like episode 1 of telltale games. The engine already there to be utilized for more story/puzzle.","June 1","true","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The style and the point and clicking. Not to mention the whole snappy quips here and there from characters. It's not overly hard to catch onto and it's something I'd play again and again!","June 3","true","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

At the ending ( not going to spoil) it will always leave a cliffhanger such as "We're getting to it next time" or "But there is something else", etc.. (The ones I've provided were not put in the game, just some examples.)\n\nHowever, with every game there is cons.\nFirst off, the game is awfully short, it doesn't have much suspects and places to explore. and at moments the game would be simple.\nBut, (this could be a pro and con, but it depends on the user), some clues are actually hard to find, some could blend in, some couldn't even been seen, but that's mystery games for ya!\n\nIn conclusion, this game is really great and I highly recommend it, if it was longer then made a better review, speaking of reviews, this is my first time actually making one that seemed professional, so if they are any grammar errors, spelling errors or things that don't make sense, then you know why!\n\n\n","June 6","true","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ellioop/recommended/272600/","ellioop","ElliOop","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ellioop/","78 products in account","Cute little point-and-click adventure game, perfect for a younger audience. Quirky characters and appealing art style compliment the mystery plot that isn't too simplistic or "kiddiefied", and the excellent soundtrack and audio design deserve a mention. For adult gamers this adventure may seem short or a bit unchallenging; despite this, Detective Grimoire was still hours of good fun.","June 5","true","3.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I finished the game, and was disappointed that it was over, and that another installment doesn't exist yet. It's a simple, entertaining game with fun voice acting, nice art style, non-frustrating puzzles and a nice little mystery to solve. I just wish there were more of it!","June 6","true","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
