"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Amerdika/recommended/2920/","Amerdika","Tylander The Traveler","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Amerdika/","438 products in account","This game I like for how fun it is to blow submarines up and try to be stealthy but I warn you this game is really complex and takes some time just to learn how to tell if something is friend or foe but int he end its always fun to make a flying torpedo hit something so try it at your own risk :).\n\nEdit due to its just a short review, long in depth (submarine joke) one below.\n\nSub command is a complex simulation game made by the people who made Dangurous Waters,Fleet Command, and 688(I) Hunter/Killer and when I mean complex I mean complex. Don't get me wrong it is a great game involving tactics, stealth, and a realistic sonar. Now there is a small campain that revolves around the 688(I) sub, the Akula and the Seawolf but I found the side missions better because they offer a wide arrange of diffrent missions and circumstances. Things that people not like about this game is the fact that its hard to read the sonar or how to acually fire a torpedo correctly, but when you acually hit your target it feels so releiving its almost something to celebrate for, though if you hear your coms say torpedo in the water and you see more blips on the sonar you start to get cold and stiff. One final thing is that this game is a precursor to Dangurous Waters so it is best to learn how to use the subarmine here because dangurous waters dosent have a interactive tutorial and you eiter have to be overwhelmed or watch videos the game wants you to watch, so its a good thing to know 6-8 buttons on the screen so you can just figure out the 2 you need. All and all this game is a great game and if you get multiplayer to work its fun freaking out your friends by firing torpedos at them and making it miss by a inch, I would buy this game and give it to a friend if it was like 49 cents or else I would buy this game for me if it was 10 or under (which I have).","November 29, 2013","true","8.3"," 40 of 48 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","40","48","0","1"

The graphics are not that good, but then in a sub you don't really get to look at the outside. Instead, you are looking at visual representation of sound, how to interpret sonar signals, and when to employ your weapons optimally, from cruise missiles to anti-ship missiles to torpedoes to mines. And this game can be hard, as hours can go by with nothing happening, while you attempt to chase down one bit of sound that may or may not be your illusive quarry... If you have an interest in the genre, this is a must-have, despite its age.","April 28, 2013","true","5.6"," 28 of 32 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","28","32","0","1"

Minimizing it basically crashed it, most of the time it wouldn't start.  I ended up having to run it in windowed mode via -windowed steam parameter and set my screen resolution to 1280x720 16bit 60hz to even view it halfway decently.\n2) Frequently hit the bottom when trying to "Hug the Bottom".  I had to turn auto sonar off as it would constantly change the bearing point that I was trying to classify to other bearing points as it "automatically searched".\n\nThe Bugs:\n1)  Campaign is almost unplayable from bugs.\nIn campaign mode, I find I have to do the missions 2-3 times each before it properly checks things off.  For example mission 1 for russia, I launch the seal team within 2 miles of checkpoint, didn't register.  The third time I tried it, while sitting on top of the checkpoint, it worked.  The next couple missions same thing, very frustrating.\n2)  The new 3d overlay is visually nice but when I click on one it blasts the noise the ship would make, way too loud, and I can't control it specifically.  I ended up turning that feature off because of this.\n\nOverall:\nI would say overall this is an "ok" sub game with more features than 688i, but it fails hard due to bugs as many games did back in the 90's.  I would much recommend 688i over this one if you've never played either, but it's hard to go back without the new features of this one.","April 7, 2015","false","16.3"," 26 of 32 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","26","32","0","0"

To compare the graphics to a more modern game isn't fair as it was created years go.  The game play however is top notch.\n\nAbsolutely nothing good happens 'quickly' on a submarine.  Attacks take time to prepare, you have to track and identify contacts and it isn't easy.  In the 'real world' you have multiple Sonar Techs and a Sonar Supervisor pouring over multiple displays, you have Fire Control Techs tracking contacts, you have the Officer of the Deck putting the picture together...in the game, you take on all of those roles.\n\nIf you want to really get an idea of what it's like, turn off every bit of assistance and crank up the difficulty...and grab a cup of the worst coffee humanly possible.  Prepare to take at least 6-8 hours to go through a mission, and now you're almost there.\n\nThis game (Sub Command) and 688i are always on my PCs, I can't help but play them when I feel 'nostalgic', hour after hour in a control room rigged for red working side by side with some of the best people you'll ever meet.\n\nOnce you have the controls down, it really is a great game, and if you do understand "how to drive a boat", that knowledge pays off.\n\nI honestly can't recommend this game highly enough, and it's as real as you can get and still release it to the general public.","July 8, 2015","true","1.9"," 15 of 15 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","15","15","2","0"

If, however, you are the kind of person who gets hot and bothered about humorous bugs every once in a blue moon, this game might not be for you. Examples include aircraft flying backward, aircraft flying at impossible altitudes (6.2k feet, or "flying" underwater), and NPC submarines suspended in the air. Not that I'm complaining - it makes for quite an interesting screenshots library. Would recommend 12/10 (the extra two points are for the photo ops due to the bugs) - and not being sarcastic.","September 21, 2014","true","54.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

RTFM, guys. Once I  did so, the game was fantastic and intense. There are some bugs in the campaign, but it is really good, anyway. I also reccomend Fleet Command.\n\nPro\nRealistic damage and weapons and ships\nSensors follow the laws of physics (mostly)\nThe campaign is fun and engaging, even with issues\nIt rewards skills, not just spraying torpedoes all around\nFor 1998, graphics are quite good, but really, who cares in a sub sim\nLong missions can be really intense with the threat of sudden death!\nFinding and classifying enemy subs is really satisfying, and then sneaking up on them....\nThe war is happening all around you, with ships fighting eachother and planes shooting eachother down above you.\nCon\n...\nThe map can get really confusing with lots of unknown contacts and the auto crew kinda sucks at figuring it out for you.\nDo not get this game if you are in to instant action and cant be patient\nIt helps a lot to have basic understanding of naval warfare. Try fleet command first, or read about it.\nDont play this game if you hate having to understand lots of little technicalities (like how your periscope breaks over about 10 mph /knots)\n\n\n","July 21, 2015","true","17.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
