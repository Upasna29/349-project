"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sayre85/recommended/334410/","sayre85","sayre85","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sayre85/","276 products in account","JUMP gives me the same feeling about VR platforming that Super Mario 64 did about 3D platforming almost 20 years ago: there are some kinks to work out, but overall, we're figuring it out.\n\nLet's be honest, 99% of gamers who have put on a VR headset (Oculus Rift, Samsung Gear VR, HTC Vive) agree that this technology is going to change the future of entertainment as a whole (not just gaming). It's the ones who haven't tried it out that remain skeptics.\n\nDue to the potential motion sickness that it might induce, JUMP may not be the right game to introduce those skeptics to the power of virtual reality, but for those of us who have our VR-legs and don't get sick easily, this game is a great challenge and fun to play. You're tasked with reaching the tallest point in each of five major U.S. cities, and you have to achieve that goal in the fewest number of jumps possible. Replaying levels to minimize your jump count becomes addictive, and the awesome soundtrack keeps you moving.\n\nLocomotion controls need to be a little bit more sensitive, and you'll notice it most when jumping to small platforms that require you to quickly slow down after sticking the landing. But that's my only real gripe.\n\nThis is the first game from Endeavor One, a studio comprised of ex-Halo and Destiny developers, and if it's any indication as to the direction they will be taking with their virtual reality games, count me excited for the future of this stuff.","July 30, 2015","true","1.9"," 37 of 49 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","37","49","0","0"

It's an awesome feeling to jump through the city in VR. First Person games often make me motion sick, but nothing so far in JUMP. But make sure you run the game in extended mode, direct seems to cause judder for others (didn't even try it after reading the feedback).\n\nI can't wait to play more and from my first impressions I can already recommend it!!\n\nGreat first taste from Endeavor One!","July 31, 2015","true","0.7"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","12","15","2","0"

However if you're a Rift gamer starved of content, give it a blast.\n\nIt's worth noting that at the time of writing this you need to use extended mode to run the game smoothly, though the devs have said that direct mode should be supported with the next release of SteamVR.","August 4, 2015","true","17.4"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","8","10","0","0"

In fact, it's so basic that I would think than anyone spending a few hours looking through Unity tutorials would be able to replicate the mechanics.\nYou just press forward toward the building you want to land on, and press A to jump, hoping you've picked the correct route, and that you haven't misjudged the distance.\n\nThe style looks a bit like Mirrors Edge, and of course it's about jumping from building to building - but there's no wallrunning in Jump,  and there are no bad guys chasing you, or any of the other elements that made ME interesting.\n\nYou're urged to try to complete each of the levels as fast as possible and with as few jumps as possible - but it feels a bit like an attempt to add an artificial sense of purpose to the game. You might also try standing on one leg while playing to add to the challenge, but why would you?\n\nIn each of the five (at time of writing) levels, the last jumps are made on square platforms hovering in the sky instead of on buildings. I guess there were no way to get to the highest buildings in each city with the chosen physics otherwise - but that also feels like a bit of a letdown. The game is bland, but at least you were supposed to jump from building to building, which should be cool. When you end up jumping on squares, it once again feels like a Unity tutorial level.\n\nIt was judder-free for me in extended mode, and the music and artstyle (however simple), is pretty good. If you're into time-trials you may like it - but as mentioned, the game is so basic that there isn't much skill involved, so once you've found the fasted route, it's just about clicking the buttons.\n\nToo pricey for such a simple game.\n\n","August 4, 2015","false","0.5"," 7 of 16 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","7","16","0","0"
