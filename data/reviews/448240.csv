It does contain a fun sanbox where you can mix and match a wide range of creatures to create crazy combinations. In addition to the creature creator is a deathmatch mode and 3 other minigames selected by choosing the "challenges" in the map selecter.  Overall I'm having a lot of fun with the minigames and enjoying creating and breeding my own cubified monstrosities.\n\nYou might like this game if you enjoyed:\nCubivore\nImpossible Creatures\n\nSee more "Plus Side" reviews at my curator page:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/theplussside#curation","May 12","true","2.7"," 33 of 37 people (89%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","89","33","37","7","0"

Breeding two animals and making a new one that is never the same if you did it again is crazy, but fun! However, despite the creative idea and the intelligent algorithms, the game is not very optimized for gameplay. You can't choose a custom mouse sensitivity, you can't choose a level of graphics (ex. low, medium, or high), and the FPS feels choppy even if it is high. Also, 9/10 times I try to play, no one is hosting, and no one even bothers trying to host! I sure hope the developer makes "official" servers that are always online.\n\nThe developer says he will make it for optimized for gameplay, and I do hope so. It's a fun idea that is just a joy to play with, but until the game is optimized, I highly suggest waiting!","May 28","false","0.5"," 30 of 42 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","30","42","0","0"

The game was originally a Steam Greenlight game (woot!) and had a decent enough following to make it to the store.\n\nFeatures\n- Multiplayer support!\n- Expirimental mode (Allows you to hybridize animals to your enjoyment!)\n- Editor: Create your own animals!\n- Workshop Support (coming!)\n- Forks.. yes. Forks..\n\nThoughtsI personally found this game on Steam Greenlight soon after the dev had posted it, I looked at the trailer and hit "VOTE" Soon after the game was Greenlit for steam, and I checked on it from time to time, and responded to people with questions. I bought the game, and I totally love it. At the time of this review it is in the first stage of a released Alpha, so it's not fully developed and could use a tad of work, but the dev is totally commited. I fully RECCOMEND this game to anyone who likes to have fun with friends!\n\nThe DeveloperFamished Mammal the developer of the game, is an awesome dude, he seems to be active working on the game. I fully support him and his development.","May 10","true","2.8"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","0"

While I find the creature generation system excedingly fun, with a huge amount of possible combinations as well as custom parent creatures able to be made, I find the gamemodes pretty shallow and lacking. The Deathmatch mode has a DOOM-lite aspect to it, with many creature zipping about the map with powerups and weapons found on the battlefield.  Also, the servers appear to have some problems, with some closing after the game is finished, DCing, etc. Overall, it may be best to wait for the game to be fleshed out further, but if you wish for a variety of games and a fun, more or less unique character creation system, this is a decent game to get. 8.5/10","May 9","true","0.6"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","9","12","0","0"

The algorithm driven creature splicings are genuinely hilarious, their stats change every 24 hours (so there's never a PERFECT mutant), all the guns and weapons have solid variety, and online works great! Just dang fun to play, pick it up already man.","May 10","true","5.8"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

Updates are yet to come (Bots, Video Improving, Adding your own creation to the hybrid list.) But of course I have some suggestions. 1) add Account info like level kill death ratio. 2) Custom Team with your friends or random player. 3) Make our own Arena to play in or make more maps. Those are half my ideas :) if possible to make these ideas come to the game im sure you'll be having more players :) :) :) thanks :D","May 19","true","5.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

After two breeds, the icon textures starting bugging. The icon starts to distort, show previous bred monsters in the same icon, and other things. Hopefully the game devs fix my glitch, because I don't think I should play it until the bug is fixed. It's not my computer. My computer can run games way more detailed and complicated than this game (no offense). Also, my computer is new, I got it about a month ago, so it's not my computer.","June 3","false","0.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","1"

I was also disappointed that when you fuse a man and a spider you don't get spiderman.

I really like the idea, it reminds me a lot of spore and other games like that, and I love the fact that you can use your mutaded freaks of nature to battle other players online. But the combat is really boring and doesnt do a very good job of keeping me invested. I may come back to this game in a year or 2 to see how its doing, and maybe I'll pick it up agian.","May 25","false","0.5"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"
