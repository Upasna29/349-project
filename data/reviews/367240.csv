Currently, one can rebind keyboard keys for instance, but solely from the Unity menu outside of the game and tutorial prompts don't reflect the change in-game. Animation is awkward and can be buggy. Jumps propell you backward if you're too close to the wall, like you're a ball. One time I was propelled some 7m in the air while climbing stairs for no apparent reason. And when you crouch, you inexplicably and slowly change your point of view downward. No, thank you, game, I'm perfectly capable of bringing the mouse down if I want to. I. just. Wanna. Crouch. But those are forgiveable things.\n\nThe greatest problem is the flavour text found in dialogues and journal. It's badly translated. Yeah, one can determine "what the poet wanted to say", but pacing of the text, syntax, idioms, metaphores - they all seem off. I mean, I'm not a native eng speaker, and I can kinda glimpse original thoughts - they're very similar to something someone from my country would make, if he weren't great at translation and would translate word-for-word. And I'm aware I've most probably butchered english grammar right now, writing this review and it is probably choke-full of spell errors, bad syntax sentences and strange foreighn idioms, but then again I'm exhausted after too little sleap last night/day and I'm fully aware I'm writing a User Steam review, not a text I'll put into a product which costs money. The text in game is not "All your bases" bad, but it's not well translated text either and young aspiring indie devs should maybe set higher standards. Plenty enough time to correct it, I just hope devs won't forget it. As it stands now, I wanted to dive into an intriguing steam-punk world, but the text kicked me right back into reality where I grade foreign language texts for a living (german, if you must know, don't have a degree in eng).\nC+ Could improve with lots of practice!\n...\nAww, schucks, changing it into B- cause of all the potential! :-)\n\nThat's it for my first 10 minutes review. If I have more constructive thoughts after playing some more, I'll update the review.\n--Edited and reworded some parts cause I realized the game is in Early Access only after I've written and posted the whole thing... 9_9","August 17, 2015","true","18.0"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","11","16","0","0"

A map feature is greatly needed. I did very much enjoy the freeroam style but there was little direction. For Early Access it is legit.\n\nThere is a conundrum with early access. If you do not support the developers and are rude they will not want to finish the game. I see it happen time after time. A great start flops for no reason when you think about it by negative people who want the moon and stars.

There's a lot of underpolish and even basic movement is highly questionable right now. I'm not even compelled to try it further than the half-hour I spent.\n\nPutting development priority on gameplay and optimisation rather than making a large world/story would probably help this game immensely. It seems to be too big of a project for its own good.\n\nSince I'm still interested in how the game will turn out, I'm going to keep an eye on the game and change this review accordingly.","December 26, 2015","false","0.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

For example, when you get to the mines there's a spiral staircase which I couldn't get down without crouching (which only seems to exist for getting down stairs) and then walking along the rail. The map doesn't really show exactly where you're meant to be heading, so there's a good chance of wandering around for several minutes until you find it. The countrols aren't really explained, so you'd have to check the controls in the options. There's a option to holster your weapons by 'holding' down the Reload button (R), which seems to serve no purpose other than activating around a third of the times you press R to reload and forcing you to run away in a fight whilst you press the button for the weapon you were using.\nAs for the story, nothing is really explained. The protaganist starts in an airship, is given a secret mission which would be better accomplished by a group rather than a single person, and, up to the part where I just gave up on the game, meets a poorly voiced android who tells him to collect items for them for no given reason. There's no actual explanation as to who the character is or why he's the one given this mission. The only other human I encountered in the game talked as if the protaganist was basically equivalent to a Private in the Inventor's Guild (another concept which isn't explained).\n\nTL;DR version:\nDon't buy it. Good concept and graphics, terrible gameplay and story.","August 30, 2015","false","0.9"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

The trees do not look realistic,they go so fast that they look like they have had too many cups of coffee. objects look like they were lowered in pollies and they buffer and flash. (know since I do 3d object creation myself) some objects are hard to click like the little red bottle on top of the big platform you have to jump on crates to get on top of. its between the beginning building where you flip switch and the cog wheel spins then you go down spiral stairs and before you talk with the robot person in next building. This title needs some serious tweeking and fixing, and I really don't feel that 14.99 is a suitable price for this title. Don't get me wrong I have played far worse games than this.. Look at Ocean City Racing if you want a badly made game.\nThis title was part of a bundle sale so I am not out much but still feel kind of ripped off.\n\nGraphics 5 out of 10 (trees can make you motion sick and the model buffering/flickering)\nGameplay 4 out of 10 (because of crashes and glitches)\nPrice 3 out of 10  (bit too much for this title at current state)\nWould I recommend this title? well if you place it against Ocean City Racing than yes its better,\nbut don't buy it full price.

I noticed the Motion Blur is too much as it is, but hey you can change it to lower levels, just thought Motion Blur would look nice but it actually didnt.\nI spawned in a Myst-like environment and fixed doors (I think) and found potions and a lot of journals I didnt want to read.\nI got outside the door and noticed the beautiful world and my much too long arm. (This was fixed after I lowered the motion Blur...might aswell be the "update" that happened the day before)\nI got inside a building and found a creepy looking robot and insulted it. The last thing I heard was something like "your mother". I walked in his direction and found out he would look up when I would come near him...played around with that for around 2 Minutes.\nI went downstairs to a workshop and got a healing potion, after that I left the building and wandered around the world. I went into another building and clicked "to forest" and my game crashed.\n\nStarted the game the next day after something like an update happened, don't exactly now whether it was an update or not.\nI started next to the robot. I had my healing potion in my inventory so I knew when the game saved, because I can't save the game myself, but I was happy with that because I thought I would have to start all over.\nI tried to get out of the building but I couldnt because I was going too soon after I opened the door... I was stuck in it, so I closed the door again, I glitched out of it, opened the door again and left.\nThen I got to another place I didnt visit before and found a weapon that I held in my left hand after that so I looked like a badass now holding two weapons.\nI went to that building were my game crasehd the day before and I was able to go to the forrest (hurray)\nIn the forest the robot said he hacked into my glasses and would talk to me now and there are bad robots in this world too. 2 Minutes later I killed two robots, 2 robot spiders and a bigger robot, found ammo and something after I went to a memorial.\nI looked around two or three corners and found nice places and a tower. (Dont go near that tower) Next to that thing was a door that led under the ground. There was another workshop where I found ammo and crafted another healing potion. Then I went downstairs and there was a man telling me everything I can see would be in his possession and I would be dead if I took anything from him. I asked him to get my quest item and I got my first quest to get him an item for the one I requested. I took a potion from his room and left. Then I quitted the game for this day.\n\nI like this game right now, not because it is a nice shooter or a nice adventure game but I like discovering funny graphic bugs or glitches and walking around that good looking forest in this steampunk, Myst-like environment.... can't recommend it for everyone but for people like me.

Most of the textures ingame seem too simple, often either 1 single texture tiled over the entire models like tables or chairs makes it look little lazy, but they are still working on it so i hope these are just placeholders. Im also not too keen to the level desing since lot of the places dont have too much detail on them.\n\nSound:\nThe game seems to lack sounds as it doesent seem to have music at all\n\nBugs and optimization:\nThe game doesent seem too bad at first but once i managed to get to the second area (Forest) my framerate dropped to 15fps, now i have a fairly powerfull system running on GTX970 but the game still seemes to struggle to keep it decent, even when i set everyting to "Low" the framerate was only 25fps, so framerate seems to be a big issue here. What comes to random bugs i seemed to found a weird one where you walk into a sign and it launches you 100 feets up in the air. The game also seems to have a really strong motion blur that kind of want to make you vomit after a while but you can always turn it off. When increasing field of View and looking down you can actually see trough your body.\n\nMovement and controls:\nThe character movement seems little slow and jumping sometimes doesent seem to work and the character jumps backwards in a slow weird manner. The game also features a stamina system that is insanely high, meaning you can run probably 15 minutes untill it depletes completely.\n\nWorld:\nEverything seems to look way too shiny to really enjoy the actual visuals but the game seems to give you freedom on where to go, alltho it doesent exactly give enough info to understand where your suppose to go, making it really disorienting and wanting to just walk aimlessly in the woods and expecting you to just find something to look at.\n\n\nIn all and all the game isint too bad, it has quite a solid foundation to it, but all the minor bugs and weird texture problems make it not too enjoyable at the moment. If in the future they manage to make it look better and get all the bigger things sorted out, the game could actually be really good, but for now i suggest peoples to wait maybe till 2016 and look back if any major updating have happent.\n\n","July 30, 2015","false","0.4"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","2"

Everything feels like it could have been okay ten years ago, but even then it wouldn't have been a great success.\n\nThe combat is one big joke, enemies simply walk at you and when they hit you it doesn't feel like anything happens. The same goes for when you hit them, you just shoot 2 bullets and then reload and after a few times the enemy drops and you continue.\n\nThere isn't really a clear path to follow, you just walk into dead ends with a few enemies and a container to loot and you'll have to walk back and find out where to go. Normally finding out where to go and exploring the map can be fun in some games but in this game it just feels like you're wasting your time.\n\nThe game supports a controller but even once I put the aiming speed of it at it's maximum it still moved very slowly, which makes the contoller simply unusable. Using the keyboard and mouse does work but still doesn't feel very comfortable.\n\nThe game is simply a pain to play and is at it's current state simply not worth playing.

I did. Interesting setting, RPG elements and lovely visuals. But I can't. Game crashes in the doorway to the second area. I can put up with all the bugs and motion sickness inducing camera, but this is just bloody terrible\n\nRefunded.","June 9, 2015","false","0.6"," 7 of 26 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","7","26","0","0"

This game, with a lot of puzzles, is a real challenge for gamers, just for hardcore gamers, so If you are thinking to buy Avenging Angel, you need to know you are not wasting your money ;D. 7/10","June 8, 2015","true","3.2"," 9 of 31 people (29%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","29","9","31","0","0"

Very disconcerting being "underwater" and having look the same as being above the water.) The visuals reminded me a lot of Myst actually.\n\nVoice work is functional. The dialogue was subpar. (A case in point. The PC swears at an NPC with no real provocation? Just because a request was made? And no other dialogue options for the PC to use if they wanted to negotiate or be more diplomatic?)\n\nCombat and movement are sluggish. Weapons are few, though I understand there are more on the way.\n\nWhich brings us sadly to the game's progress. The developers have promised an update which is extremely overdue and communications have been downright glacial. I am actually concerned about this being abandonware. I understand that this is Early Access but that means you need to be more verbal about delays not less.\n\nIf you are interested, I would say wait six months then check and see what has happened. If the project has moved forward, then see what is going on in the forum. If it seems genuine forward motion has been made then maybe invest in Avenging Angel. Otherwise, stay away.","May 7","false","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
