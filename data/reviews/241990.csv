But once you've played a couple of games and grasped the mechanics, it is hard not to notice the many design and balance flaws as well as how shallow the game ultimately is. With time, these issues can hopefully be addressed but as it stands now, this game is hard to recommend at the $40 price point. Wait for a sale instead, and hopefully you'll get a patched and better balanced game in the process as well.\n\nIn-depth review\nI find this game to be okay... There are quite a number of components that are better (e.g. quest variety) than Stardock's previous efforts in the Elemental series (Fallen Enchantress, Legendary Heroes) and the graphical and UI overhaul is largely welcomed. Many of the subsystems will feel very familiar to players who have played Legendary Heroes, including the not-particularly-tactical Tactical combat, right down to obscure stats like Spell Mastery (which is a different stat from Spell Damage).\n\nSo, basically, I believe that if you like the premise of the game, if you have a certain fondness for 4X games, this will probably satisfy you to a degree and you'll have fun. If you like tactical combat (such as those found in the Heroes of Might and Magic series, as well as King's Bounty, and most notably Age of Wonders 3), you'll find yourself sorely disappointed. There _is_ a tactical element to tactical combat, it just doesn't feel particularly deep compared to the examples above.\n\nMy personal misgivings about the game in its current state include:\nLongevity of the game once you have beaten it once. There are only two victory conditions after all and they'll play out the same no matter what. The only thing that differs is what playstyle you utilize to get there. And yes, while there are 6 sovereigns each with their own unique units/play style slant/gimmick, they ultimately all train the same base units which all utilise the same progression paths.\nConcerns about balance - units like Enchanters are a late addition and don't feel like much thought has put into making them an interesting strategic option. At the moment, units like Enchanters and Clerics just feel entirely useless instead with how fragile they're and their low initiative (which means they take action very rarely, and pretty much die instantly if an enemy ranged unit looks at them funny, or if an enemy mage were to cast an AOE spell...) - you're much better off giving that precious army slot to another Paladin or Rider instead which brings so much more to the table in comparison... Given that Enchanters were added by Brad, the lead designer of the game, it doesn't inspire much confidence... (compare to the design process and goals that goes into games like League of Legends, the way the Enchanter was designed and added just feels random/adhoc).\nVarious obscure elements not well explained e.g. what do traits like Wisdom, Courage, Persuasion, Cruelty do (you pretty much find out only by watching the Stardock streams or searching the forums), with no way to look at what traits you've accumulated so far. What is the spell mastery stat (not explained in the Help sections, or manual, or tooltips)?\nConcerns about the Crafting subsystem - It gets _really_ tedious late game, and there are issues... For instance, when you seemingly max out on Crafting recipes, the game doesn't handle it well (e.g. you can still attempt to trade for more crafting recipes, pay the price and get nothing in return).\nAlot of the spells/skills are not enticing - playing the Priest, I barely found the need to cast anything beyond Into the Light, Restore, and the occasional Refresh in tactical combat. Also, many of the sovereign skill trees do not offer choices that feel very compelling or rewarding. Note that you need to sacrifice your unit's turn to cast a sovereign spell in tactical combat, but I rarely found this trade off worthwhile.\nIffy design concerns - I have concerns with general placement/layouts of the sovereign skill trees. As an example, I find inexplicable how "Enchanted Forges" is extremely early in many of the sovereign skill trees yet you can't actually build the corresponding Wonder to actually unlock enchanting until mid-late game...  On the other hand, +army size is fairly accessible for some of the sovereigns (e.g. Priest, strangely, who according to dev journals, was designed to have weaker/smaller armies), and extremely inaccessible for some of the others who really need it (e.g. the Guardian sovereign, who starts with a Ranger hero with skills that benefit ranged units as well as Tame Beasts yet struggles to find the army slots necessary to fit in frontline units/beasts and still have space for ranged backline).\nAt the end of the day, the biggest concern is with longevity. You're ultimately playing a solo game here, and with there being only 2 ways to win, and with you going through the same motion and fighting the same boss every single time, with there being only 1 playable race, it is probably going to get old fast.\n\nAnd by the way, I thought I would just toss it out there that the asymmetric turn-based games has been done before - the campaign games of classics like Heroes of Might and Magic have you undergo similar jounreys to overcome asymmetric challenges. Within the 4X space, the campaign modes of games like Age of Wonders 3 pretty much offers the same (as well as a very satisfying sense of questing, levelling, progression, and more satisfying tactical combat). The problem is Sorcerer King is that the asymmetric premise is kind of the only thing you have going on, whereas all these other games, including Stardock's own past entires like Fallen Enchantress and Legendary Heroes, actually more ways to play and more races/classes to play with.\n\nAt $40, this is a Not Recommended for me. Suggest that you wait and get this when it is on sale instead (hopefully the game will also be more polished then).\n\nPlayers who already own Legendary Heroes can get the game at $30 with the discount code from the Stardock store, and at the $30 price point, it still is hard to make a recommendation for this game in its current state with any conviction.","July 16, 2015","false","18.7"," 644 of 727 people (89%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","89","644","727","18","23"

In fact, if you go into this game expecting a typical 4X experience and challenge, you may well be disappointed. Yet, the differences are what made me really enjoy this game over its competitors.\n\nThe way I prefer to see SK is as an RPG with a 4X control scheme. Sure, you build cities and expand your empire, but the main focus of the game is always on your champions. You explore the world, you find and do quests, you hunt for loot to craft new equipment, and get experience for your heroes so you can handle the final boss at the end. The strategy elements are still there, but downplayed compared to the RPG elements. This is the type of game for those of us who enjoyed our hero stacks in other fantasy strategy games.\n\nAlso be warned that SK is a very text-heavy game. A lot of the quests, as well as the interactions between yourself and your various allies and enemies, are told through text boxes. The writing isn't especially deep, but is filled with humor and snark through-out. This keeps the writing interesting, even if it may seem a little jarring with the post-apocalyptic premise.\n\nI am personally much more of an RPG gamer than a strategy one, and so it surprised me how much I ended up truly loving Sorcerer King. It definitely gets my recommendation, and I'm eager to see how the game continues to develop.","September 24, 2015","true","157.2"," 265 of 290 people (91%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","91","265","290","3","5"

Instead of expanding and improving that franchise Stardock was intent on releasing a new game that's honestly better suited for an ipad. At first glance the game isn't bad and to be fair I did somewhat enjoy my first playthrough. It completely lacks depth though and once you've beaten the game you've really seen it all. If it was 5.99 I would recommend it as a novelty but that's all it is... a novelty.\n\nBasically, all you do is take your heroes and run around the world fighting monsters and competing text based quests that just basically involve you choosing an option and fighting a monster.

So, of course, I figured that the negative reviews for Sorceror King were probably not going to be accurate for me.  Here it is, a week since I've bought the game and I can't even bother to try to make it through my 2nd complete game.  I'm a big fan of this company but they really missed the target with Sorceror King.\n\n1 - Enemy armies can enter your ZOC and attack you in the same turn meaning you have no advance warning so you can try to protect yourself.\n\n2 - I generally end up with one solid hero but he and his units have to spend half of their time Cloud Walking back to whatever territory is getting overrun by enemy units _constantly_.  I can normally get 4-6 turns away from a territory before I have to come back which significantly reduces my ability to expand.\n\n3 - Depending on your starting spawn the game is really just, simply boring.  All you have to do is get a unit with 3+ paladins and a hero, put some good gear and +move/+initiative stuff on them and you're going to walk through anything that is put in your way.  Diplomacy is non-existent.\n\n4 - You often find yourself in a scenario where because you walked into a Bazaar square there's no way to get out of it so you *have* to choose one of the trade options even if you don't like any of them.\n\nAt this point short of a miracle patch or DLC I don't think I'll ever play this title again.  And I have played Fallen Enchantress: Legendary Heroes off and on for years now.","July 27, 2015","false","68.5"," 166 of 210 people (79%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","79","166","210","5","5"

I've played all of the Elemental titles and this is by far the worst.  It's a departure from the more traditional 4x genre but not in a good way.  It's more of a choose your own adventure mobile game in a cartoon setting.\n\nTLDR -Issue:  The game itself is really more of a single mission or scenario rather than a full fledged game.\n\nSingle Player: It's "Won and done" as you're doing the same thing every single time.  Zero replayability, zero depth.  I know you're saying to yourself, "but you have 130 hrs in-game?"  Again, lots of EA skirmish time and a run through of each class can get you that sort of playtime.  However it barely matters what class you choose as you end up with all the same units and most of the same spells anyways.  Same mission everytime, same units everytime, same gear everytime - no matter your choices.  It's one dimensional and boring.\n\nMP:  None\n\nStory:  There isn't one, other than kill the bad guy.  Not that SD ever did a good job at developing the lore of Elemental but the little they did share is gone.  I felt like I was starting to get a feel for the factions, geography and lore after FE but that was all "streamlined" out.  I should note that SK in fact is a comedy.  The writing itself is comedic but it obviously doesn't fit the setting.  Honestly, it's comparable to walking around with Tosh 2.0 making fun of everything you see and everyone you talk to.  Again, it doesn't mesh with an end-time saga of survival.\n\nGraphics:  Plastic kid toons.  The visual assets and UI look like they were outsourced to the My Little Pony people.  Adds a layer of unwanted cheese and embarrassment.  I brought this up on the forum in EA and was told that people really like the Fisher Price look.  No, they really don't.  Your game didn't sell, people hated it.\n\nCampaign:   Just when I thought Stardock couldn't offer any less of a campaign than they did in GC3 they went ahead and proved me wrong with SK.  It's quite literally a singular, static skirmish map with gate icons that partition the map and trigger text events.  I've been playing vids for 30 years and this is one of laziest efforts that I can remember.  I played a ton of early access thinking they were just getting warmed up with content and features for release but sadly they really weren't, it was obvious they had given up on the game months prior.\n\nUnfortunately this franchise is all but done.  They didn't see much of a future for it based on their effort, budget and execution.  It needed to get darker, deeper and more story driven to legitimize the franchise and instead they mailed it in with a silly, watered down mobile game.\n\nIt's efforts like this and GC3 that remind us that Stardock is really more of a publisher than a developer.  SK is a low end game that warrants $20 maximum.  I used to respect Stardock but it feels like they stopped respecting themselves and it shows in their poor quality games and DLC.","January 8","false","132.7"," 91 of 107 people (85%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","85","91","107","5","6"

However, it is absolutely lacking in content.  You only get one faction to play.  You only ever get one enemy to fight.  There are just a handful of monsters and generals to face.  You can only choose from a few leaders for your single faction.  Stardock did not try to give the customer value in this game.\n\nGameplay is redundant. You fight the same scenario each game.  It doesn't matter that the map chances, it's the same darn scenario each time.  You can't customize the number of opponents, win conditions, and faction abilities.  It's just the same routine over and over.\n\nThis game may get better with expansions, but they will need to be broad expansions.  There needs to be so much added to this game to make it as good as FE:LH 2.0.  Stardock should reconsider whether it was wise to launch a game with such little content and hopefully never make that mistake again.","October 3, 2015","false","39.5"," 81 of 93 people (87%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","87","81","93","2","7"

After you've played it a few times, you've played it". He also committed to fixing that issue. His ideas to fix it included the ability to play as one of the minor factions and to have multiple win conditions. However, to me, this will just make the game a  lighter and shallower version of Fallen Enchantress or Ledgendary Heros.\n\n\nAs for the game play:\nIt's very fun at first. However, it's shallow compared to Legendary Heros, and gets old fast. Futher, the sovereigns, while different, are rarely needed to be called on beyond the early game, and perhaps at the final battle.\n\nMany of the level ups for heros just aren't useful or interesting. Many of the spells are fairly useless. You'll find yourself using the same small group of spells over and over. They claim that there are many, many quests, but I often get the same ones each time I've played. Futhermore, the treasure in each quest (or monster lair) is the same group of gems and berries (used in crafting) over and over again\n\nThe crafting system feels clunky and isn't worth the effort, because most of the the items you can craft are pretty weak.\n\nThe style of writing and humor used in quest and interactions with the minors and SK is amusing initially, but like the overall game play, gets old fast. I would characterize the humor as snarky, cynical, mean, and juvenile. The units are the same for all sovereigns, and the mage ones are weak and not worth training. If you're looking for high fantasy, look elsewhere.","July 24, 2015","false","62.1"," 93 of 120 people (78%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","78","93","120","2","0"

And after all my experience i thought, this would be great if instead of fighting other factions who are similar, fight one all powerful faction and you can equip all your units individually.\n\nAnd thats exactly what stardock has done with sorcerer king.\n\nSorcerer king is a sublte blend of RPG and 4X, but imo, more emphisis on the rpg, which is to my approval and it reminds me of the board game talisman for some reason. Its not similar in mechanics (sorcerer king is far more complex) but just the goal. Build up strong enough to fight the end game baddie, which i suppose is the goal of all rpgs. But sorcerer king sprinkles that city building element and makes it more richer for it.\n\nThe other thing about stardocks games, (and i know im going out on a limb here) but it has a style, a feel, a brand.\nSomething so rare with modern gaming (30+ years experience).\nYou know when you play a blizzard game you know its made by blizzard?

You no longer design your own units with equipment the way you did in previous FE games.\nIt is true, you do not.  Instead, you get generic unit types like swordsmen, spearmen, archers, riders, knights, etc.  In addition, you can form alliances with Remnant factions and get unique units that way.\n\nHowever,  a crafting system has been added so you can create armour and such to equip these units!  In addition, equipment can be enhanced!\nYou can't change the weapon the units are equipped with, but you can give them additional armour, and add elmemental damage via rings and such.\n\nIn addition, designing units was honestly a pain in the butt in the previous games.  When you research new technologies, you got to design the unit with the upgraded equipment.  It felt tedious and time consuming.  Stardock has enhanced and streamlined the unit improvement process in SK compared to FE:LH's static unit designing.\n\n2.  It's no longer a true 4X because of asynchronous gameplay (your goal is to kill the sorcerer king, while the SK's goal is to destroy all the shards on the map to become the eternal ruler of the world).\n\nWell, AIs tend to be the worst part of 4x games, and generally result in these games offering very little challenge because 4x are generally too complex for an AI to do well (unless they got insane bonuses).  FE:LH suffered from this problem because the AI just wasn't very good at attacking the player or creating deadly armies (e.g. lots of high-initiative ranged attackers).\n\nBy making the gameplay asynchronous, Stardock made the AI more challenging.  The AI will spawn armies that attack the shards, which you can stop by stationing your armies to fight them off.\n\nIn other words, both changes actually improved the gameplay compared to FE:LH.\n\n\nOther Improvements:\n- the graphics are now much more colourful and fantasy-like.\n- 6 leader types, all of which have their own technology tree and style of play based on their tech tree.\n- The addition of minor factions that you can sway to your cause, who then assist you with units, technology, and/or resources","May 16, 2015","true","106.1"," 101 of 138 people (73%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","73","101","138","4","0"

One such quality is the fact that this game is a casual gaming experience.  (a brief pause for the stereotypical Hardcore players' gasps and shudders)  If you are a veteran 4X player hailing from the lands of Sid Meier's Civilization, Heroes of Might and Magic, or Endless Space, then you might be a little disappointed by the lack of mind bending strategies, depth of min/maxing, or precision fine tuning of global economies.  To be clear, I absolutely <3 all 3 of those games.\n\nHowever, this little gem is great because of it's simplicity.  It taps into the essence of all the things that make the 4X genre great without being overly complicated (or making new users figure out what is going on in the world by using 20 different UI screens filled with charts and graphs).\n\nEach Sovereign has an ability unique to themselves, a Champion (with starting party) that represents how they handle things on the battlefield, and a set of spellbooks.  The spellbooks determine the likelihood that spells of certain categories will appear when you reasearch.\n\nThe maps are littered with little dungeons, caves, ancient battlefields, etc; each with the purpose of delivering a little comically written quest.  When the quest is done, rewards are given, cake is eaten, and you move on your way to the next quest or enemy army.  Your Champions will level up and gain new abilities as you battle your way to the Sorcerer King's doorstep (he's a total jerk btw).  Battles are fought turn-based on a chess-like grid in a setting that reflects the area you initiated the battle.\n\nYou will encounter other races that are basically quest givers and potential allies/enemies alike.  The Sorcerer King will be trying to gain their favor as well, and some of them are sworn enemies of each other.  This means that if you ally with one, it might just be impossible for you to become friends with the other.  Having these guys on your side will provide you with periodic trade options, or some other kind of assistance in your efforts against the Sorcerer King.  While they may not provide much direct military support on their own, at least they are with you, rather than against you.\n\nIf you require your 4X to bombard you with information til your eyes bleed hashtags, then I would move along.  If you're looking for a simple 4X with a casual pace and light hearted spirit, or if you have never played a 4X game in your life and want a good entry to the genre, then look no further than Sorcerer King.","August 18, 2015","true","87.0"," 54 of 66 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","54","66","0","2"

It is graphically (both in terms of 3D and artwork) much better though, and its gameplay is slightly different despite several things in common.\n\nBut like it predecessors, SK is unpolished and has countless infuriating game design flaws. To give a few examples, there are several city enchantments which are based on how many essences this city holds in its territory (essences is the source of magic or mana if you prefer). Those spells may for example add life, defense or initiative to the units trained in that city while the enchantment is active so the player is encouraged to find the richer spots in essence to build its cities and focus its production in them. But of course the tile yield is rarely shown (typically you need to "fertilize" lands with another mid-game spell to actually see the best spots) as only one terrain type (fertile) and its surroundings do actually give that information. This would not be so much of a problem if another game mechanic had been better thought, buildings and especially unique buildings which you cannot destroy. Typically the "Paladin" unit can only be built in one city due to a "1 per faction" building restriction on the construction that unlocks it. So building this in a low essence yield tile is of course a poor long term strategy, because you cannot destroy the building (well there is a work around which is to have some wandering monsters to destroy the whole city, but this again means you have to not have cleaned all the spawning camps in the area).\n\nWhile crafting/enchanting is definitely an interesting feature to have in a 4X game, the weapon bug is a pretty annoying one and I am very amazed that having purchased this game on sale a year after its release (I don't trust Stardock anymore as a developer I have to say, even if I keep buying their half-decent product I now always do it for half-price or less) that such a major and annoying bug is still around. Basically you can equip weapons on all of your units, but some have a level requirement. If the feature works for heroes, for all the regular units it simply does not even if your unit have the appropriate level and using the appropriate type of weapon. I read there is a work-around which consist to enchant the weapons, save the game and reload. I played without crafting/enchanting weapons so far so I will confirm (and edit here) at later stage if I ever do check this solution. But hell, seriously... what self-respecting developer would leave such a major bug in its beloved product for its beloved community to enjoy so much time after the official release? Well, one who doesn't care about any of the latter maybe?\n\nDon't get me wrong, besides the lack of polish and lack of interest in delivering its still loyal audience near flawless products (speaking of the in-house ones, as third party publishing of Stardock delivered some gems), this game is still an enjoyable 4X with some good ideas. Quest writing does not take itself seriously at all and there was a lot of effort put in making the narration diverse and fresh. Although the concept of the Sorcerer King allowing you to grow at the same time as trying to punish you for doing so turns out to be very secondary at the end (and basically when you master your expansion, you will just ignore him and your doomday counter will remain at zero, while you play the game like any other 4X) and it become near to irrelevant feature.\n\nThe replayability is pretty low at the end, as the balance between the trainable units is pretty bad (unless you rely on other factions'troops in which case you may have more options than with "indigenous" ones) despite a good effort in diversifying the 6 playable character classes. Each class has its own specific "empire skill tree" and core spells which are definitely going to assymetrically affect your expansion and strategies, and then you can choose a starting hero and a unique spell (provided you wanna optimize your leader for a specific strategy instead of using the standard ones, for synergies like large armies of the Commander combined with the ranger hero massive bonuses to ranged units). This is certainly where the game is very exciting and fun as indeed there are a few possiblities available for the creative player.\n\nAlso, once you understood what are the self-defeating game mechanics in this game spamming "crusade" and "destiny's gift" which are not only cheap to cast but also overpower every other unit enchant and grindy crafting, it becomes quickly uninteresting/unchallenging once you reach mid-game. Obviously what Stardock lacks is a proper, passionnate testing team or they should learn to listen to relevant feedback in their community (preferably early on with Beta testers). I could go on with "guide-like" criticism, but I sincerly think the game stops being fully enjoyable once you find out about all the possible exploits available because this game was clearly rushed out of the production line.\n\nIt is hard for me to decide if I shall recommend Sorcerer King or not and while writing this review I am still knowing it is going to be a 51/49 close call (since I have to make a choice). So I shall say that I would recommend it on sale, but I will press the "no" button because I think Stardock just lack that finition skills (often because they already moved on the next DLC or next iteration in the franchise) to actually make their games near to flawless, which I am sure they could do if they really wanted to.","April 20","false","65.8"," 35 of 38 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","35","38","0","6"

I finished an entire game not just a combat without casting any battle spells........so great feature.\n\nThe Champions are all very 'meh' and dont seem very heroic at all with some poor graphical depictations. Why give a champion a dragon mount and have it teleport around the battlefield? Why put a quiver on what otherwise looks like a handsome little figure! Why have a mage/fighter combo that doesnt work in this game?\n\nThe units; or lack of recruitable units are also very 'meh' which wouldnt be a problem if you had better acces to other races or units but in all the games I have played I have never had anything other than generic units. If i play on random small or medium maps all the other civs are destroyed before i even make contact with them and if I play on large or huge maps well.........I'm still looking\nIts very annoying that you have to choose a specific leader to just get some 'basic' unit classes, for example knights or any kind of spell caster although these are useless in their current state so not really missed to be honest. The knights however coupled with their shiny foot counter parts are nigh unstoppable so you know what to build and spam. In battles with 5 or 6 of these units against anything even a uber bad guy mini boss they wipe everything before the mages and archers even get a shot off. Its even more annoying considering how many different units i have seen in the game and I cant get acces to them!!!!! and why cant i summon anything other than a wisp;a single skeleton; a anemic frost thing and something else that was so forgettable i forget what it was.\n\nGraphics and music 9/10; it would have been 10 but that damn empty quiver on the back of the warrior class knocked a point off.\n\nThe whole game has a weird feel to it..........Some aspects of the narration between you and the evil baddie are very childish even for say a ten year old; in fact my nephew who is ten laughed at it and thought it more for someone aged 6 so who knows the target audience is maybe 8 years old? Anyway.......some of it is seriousish and a lot of it is click click click fight reward as after reading the same drivel a few dozens times you lose interest.\n\nThere certainly is no high epic heroic fantasy feel to it at all; its more like my little pony with a unicorn horn glued on and a ken doll dressed in plastic armor.\n\nWho knows maybe the 'campaign' feature will be great and the next 30 days will see huge improvements and im still going to play it to see if i can get it to 'work' but as it is unless you either a) are indeed an 8 year old or b) find most strategy games too challenging and c) like your fantasy RPG more like Willow than LOTR then this is probably not the game for you. You should try AGE OF WONDERS instead of this if you want to at least have something to do with the left or right hemisphere of your brain as this game lacks any challenge currently; my bad i forgot about the really OP grezen or whatever they are called at the start with their twin axes who will obliterate your starting armies but aside from that.......as the meerkat brethen would say.......simples.\n\nDid i mention all the spells you research and never; i mean NEVER use? I was i must admit panicking about the doom counter.....alright panicking perhaps not the right word......more ****** off i couldnt play at the pace i wanted to but after 200+ turns its still only a tiny bit full so dont worry about that. Resources and city building sites are awful in its current state for 'random' maps.\nSo many things to forge but so little resources to do it and by the time i get the resources my troops are so 'UBER' hard i dont need to put a smelly leather helmet on it to make it harder and why can i put a leather helmet on a 'Sentinel' class troop clad all in shiny armor? also if you expect anything that you make to be visibly represented on your little people forget it. Except for the weapons of some Champions i think; again I had started to nod off by the time i had equipped a different sword to my champion who could by this time kill anything in her path with a fire breathing mount....which i like but it STILL CANT FLY!!!!! its more like a fire breathing tauntaun with some wings glued on.\n\nWhat really bugs me now is the complete lack of diversity you have which is meant to be countered by recruiting other races to your cause and using their untis; wouldnt know as stated earlier; why oh why cant you pick one of the other races to play as the 'main' race and everyone else naturally plays a role as a minor race. I think this is a HUGE **** up by the development team and in truth I am amazed that this and everything else i have mentioned has not been fed back to them by the beta testers who as usual have either failed at their jobs or the developers have once again donned the god complex of im right and you guys have no idea what you are talking about.\n\nDid i mention you can enchant things too........yeah......click.......click.......its blue.....click......well it all looks great in my imagination.......but nothing changed on screen.......oh dear.\n\nOne last thing i think.......I have a top end pentium super duper ivy league bridge......32 billion mega bits of ram corsair cooling system.......graphics card that i could fry eggs on and on a HUGE map this game is still horribly slow......but weirdly so. I could handle clicking end turn and a little hour glass for example spins letting you know that the A.I is making its moves but no........I click end turn and sometimes Im back in control and sometimes its still taking its turns and im sort of being allowed to do stuff its weird and slow.......even on large maps. The game does try and compensate though and make most of the HUGE maps 75% water and mountains.......oh the random maps are soooooooooo ****ing annoying right now! lol\n\nWould i recommend you buy this game? If you have grown weary of Age of Wonders and need something to do before you feel refreshed then buy this game. If you didnt like Fallen Enchantress then buy this game; if you did however then I would say buy this only on sale as you will play it then go back and play Fallen Enchantress and wonder how they went so wrong.\n\nA final note; it could be that the 'Campaign' is very well balanced and you get to play a diverse role with different units and lords as you progress through scenarios to defeat the evil sorcerer king and if thats the case then I will ammend this review upon its final release.\n\n*Update* Just to highlight how easy this game currently is..........I levelled Varda the Slayer to near max which isnt too hard in itsself and she on her own without an army killed the Sorcerer King who cheats ridiculously in the fight. The closer to death he is the higher his initiative is so he gets 5 or 6 attacks to your 1 for example. Anyway.......Max out your dodge and equip an uber sword and go kill the sorcerer king and read the little box that tells you well done for finishing the game........no epic endings here.\n\nI can understand why the release date has been pushed back to October as its certainly not anywhere near fit for release yet unless you just want to stare at it and admire how pretty it is.","June 5, 2015","false","67.9"," 145 of 225 people (64%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","64","145","225","18","9"

Read the rest of this review for more detail.\n\nI’ll start this review off by saying that I wasn’t a huge fan of Fallen Enchantress or Elemental: War on Magic games.  I found each of them would degenerate into a grind once the initial exploration phase was done with.\n\nHowever Sorcerer King dodges this bullet and maintains it’s pace and interest throughout.  This is basically because it’s not trying to be a fantasy TBS 4X game, it’s more a hybrid between an RPG and a TBS 4X.  I’ll sum my thoughts up with a series of bullet points below:\n\nPros:\n+  Streamlined 4X elements – fewer cities, more focus on a few groups of units.  Although this will probably deter people who are expecting a pure 4X game.\n+  RPG/Quests – they’re all basically multi-choice quests that will grant certain rewards based on your decisions.  However they’re well written and grant points associated with your playstyle (for example +1 courage for attacking a group of bandits rather than running from them).  These in turn (as you rack them up) will trigger events as the game progresses.\n+  Quick, tactical combat – nothing revolutionary but the battles are quick, and straightforward.  The available tactics are limited and generally revolve around clever use of skills and initiative.  They’re much better than in the FE and E:WoM games which had your troops taking 2 or 3 turns running across the battlefield before they’d even be able to enter combat.\n+  The doomsday counter and interactions with the Sorcerer King adds flavour and an element of urgency.  It really does feel like you skulking around in the shadows in the first part of the game.\n\nCons\n-  The AI isn’t fantastic.  I often had enemies run through burning tiles in tactical battles, resulting in them dying when they could have just gone around it.  Also while fighting the ice lieutenant it repeated targeted one of my units that was immune to cold based attacks, leaving my other units to slowly whittle away his health.  Making the combat much, much easier than it should have been.\n-  As the Sorcerer King raises the threat that he perceives you to be you’ll find that he will send more and more troops against you.  This is fine but they just appear as monster lairs which your borders, which seems a bit of a cheat to me.\n-  Replayability isn’t fantastic.  I’ve completed the game and all I can do now is more of the same.  The different Sovereigns do make a small amount of difference to how you play but fundamentally the game will largely play out the same regardless.  More winning conditions or different races would make the game much more replayable.\n\nOther/General\n*  Graphics are clean and do the job.  It’s a shame that changing a characters weapons/armour doesn’t show on the unit but it’s not a big deal.\n*  The music does a good job of reflecting the type of game this is.  Sound is fine.\n*  I’ve not experienced any bugs while playing\n*  The crafting mechanic can become a little laborious later on but it’s fun finding and trying out new recipes\n*  The army design mechanic that was in the previous titles has been removed which may irritate a few people.\n\nAnyway this has become a bit of wall of text so I’ll leave it there and add a TL:DR section at the top.","July 23, 2015","true","31.5"," 39 of 52 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","39","52","0","0"

Building off of the strength that was Fallen Enchantress, Sorcerer King should have been an enhancement of an already solid game.  Unfortunately the devs have continued to veer down the path of half-baked work smothered in awkward humor (seriously...the jokes are not funny).  Visually, the design is dated.  As has been mentioned in other reviews, this feels like a tablet/phone game.  There is no depth.  The concept of fighting against a 'doom' timer is interesting and that is the only plus of this effort.  My advice is not to bother purchasing this garbage,  no matter the discount.

This game I feel was made soley for people who are looking for a more modern remake of "Masters of Magic" (MoM), and even then it may not hit the head on the nail for some of you. After playing I can understand some of your gripes. My main gripe is that they didnt spend the extra time to create a procedurally generated world, or at least randomize/reconfigure the location of huts, resources, etc just to give the game the appearance of replayabiliity without becoming extremely dull. I mean, cmon, evern MoM had a procedurally generated world with infinite replayablitiy. I feel they are doing their project a severe injustice by not doing this.\n\nThat aside, I found the game very fun and most similiar to the old MoM. This is the one instance where I would say don't let the "mixed" reveiew rating be your deciding factor for this game. I bought it when it was on sale for $10 and I dont think I would have spent the $25 on it that it's going for now.\n\nThey game uses a spellbook system in a similiar way that MoM did,  with customizable wizard. Although MoM was more strategy based like a normal 4x strat game, this game focuses more about having a main party roaming the map discovering stuff, destroying stuff, crafting stuff, and getting stronger and stronger so that it will ultimately be able to win a final showdown with an opposing Uber 1337 squad. Not too much unlike the orginal MoM, just a little easier to defend cities. The only units with any kind of late game longevity that your cities can build require difficullt to attain strategic resources which you will have to acquisition a flow of into your empire before you can consider training this leet army. Just like having to secure a bunch of uranium in Civ before you can build a fleet of nukes to  holocaust the world.\n\nIn many ways it does a good job recreating MoM except they really need to give you a randomized start for replayability. One of the main things that reminded me of MoM is how useless decent units are at first until you get their rank up. Remember having a bunch of green bowman barely be able to take anything out at first? I could go on but I think I've said enough, if you really have any questions for me friend and pm me Ill try to answer you.\n\nTLDR: Surprisingly good if you're looking for a Masters of Magic remake. Lacks variancd and replayablitiy (to much chagrin). Still a good game if you're pining for some gold ol MoM. I got it in sale, IDK if I'd pay 25 for it.  You may only play it once through due to the lack of replayability so if you're a leet gamer play on Hard instead of Average for a real challenge.","April 23","true","36.3"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","0"

There are minor factions you can ally with or declare war on, but you always have one ultimate opponent: the Sorcerer King. This neatly solves the problem in MoM of needing to wipe out each opponent in turn: once you defeat the SK, the game is won. There is also a Spell of Mastery–like win condition for at least some of the sovereigns.\n\nThere are still some bugs in 1.0, but nothing too horrible.

Probably. You're here, aren't you? That must mean that you have some interest in fantasy 4X or Stardock or the Elemental series. Do you like the idea of a fantasy 4X that borrows ideas from AI War or Star Control 2 and spins it in a unique way?\n\nSorcerer King is an assymetrical 4X game that resembles Arcen Game's AI War and is the product of many lessons learned from the Elemental series. When they say that it's assymetrical, it means that the other 'players' aren't playing by the same set of rules or with the same set of objectives as you are. You're playing a game that imagines that you played the last 4X game and lost. The winner, the Sorcerer King, is now trying to acheive God status and you are only a minor faction among many that attempts to rebuild, and possibly stop him, while negotiating with the countless Sorcerer King armies and deal with the other minors.\n\nIt introduces a Dungeon Master that will constantly monitor how you play and playstyles that you might be favoring and will adjust the game and the game world accordingly. Using archers too much? The DM might just initiate an event that causes "high winds" and now arrows are extremely unreliable. Using your cavalry units too much? Darn, that horse virus just wiped out half of your horse population. Imagine the possibilities!\n\nThe crafting system is superb and will only get better. As you travel the world, you'll find different items that will help you craft new armor, new rings, new weapons! You'll also find new crafting recipes, the occasional new item free of the need to craft it, and other awesome stuff. The crafting system is reminiscent of Master of Magic, but now it has a super slick UI and it's been brought to 2014/15.\n\nMinor factions are center stage, too. You'll need to woo them and convince them of the strength of your cause. Eventually, we'll be completing multi-stage quests for the minor factions in order to ally with them and gain access to special units, items or other benefits. They speak to you and interact with you in ways very reminiscent of Star Control 2. They aren't  there just yet, but they will be very, very soon.\n\nAlso, quests are being written by a Cracked.Com writer and each of them (there will be over 200!) are witty and fun and lead to some really fun choices and exciting outcomes. They're easily the best quest dialogues I've ever seen, including the recent quest-oriented Endless Legend. I've laughed out loud at a few and I'm a hard dog to make laugh.\n\nThere's more to this game than meets the eye. It's not a re-skin, it's not a reboot. It's an all-new and unique take on the 4X genre that combines the best of the genre with some truly exciting RPG elements.\n\nStardock is a true champion of the genre. With one exclusion, they've made solid 4X games for some time now. Supporting this game and Stardock is supporting the genre and this game is deserving of that pledge of support.\n\nJust buy it.

I don't deny it's a tad pricy, even on a discount, but it's not a disaster, and quite a few of the core components are functional, making the game still playable. The missing tutorial means trial and error for now but that's nothing new. If you don't like unfinished works then I'm not sure why you're even looking at an early access game. However, the game has a good sense of humor, even about it's unfinished nature, and it gave me a good laugh while being entertaining. It's not overwelmingly confusing even without the tutorial, and seems forgiving of trial and error, which for /any/ game is a good plus.

It's like watching a movie in which rebels will team up to fight a tyran.\nNot only do you have to stop the Sorcerer's ongoing plans while he is watching you, but your choices in all kinds of random events will hasten or slow the Sorcerer's progress. You actually might have to think twice about your choices: Will you be greedy, get instant results and hasten the doom clock? Or will you be kind, let go of treasures and win time?\n\nMap resources feel very valuable as they are not plentiful, but this might change as the game development continues.\n\nSpells and items are very much like in Fallen Enchantress, except you now have random chances to research less common spells. There is no tech tree, but you don't really notice.\n\nItem shops have been replaced by a crafting system, which really feels a ton better than the shops.\nIn order to craft an item you need both the teachings for that item and the crafting materials - which are random drops.\nYou can't just hoard whatever items you want, regardless of how rich you are. You need luck, patience and planning.\nThat reminds me: There is no gold or such all-round currency here! It's an improvement, as there is no longer any resource that can be hoarded and used to buy everything and anything.\n\nUnits cannot be customized like in Fallen Enchantress. BUT, trained units may now equip most items just like your heroes! As such, the difference between heroes and units has been reduced. Units cannot learn new skills and they cannot equip weapon items, but they are otherwise pretty much like heroes.\n\nAs of now what I miss the most is more variety of spells, buildings and items, and customizing when creating a game.\nI'm sure all of these will come before the game is released - plus the possibility of creating your own!","December 21, 2014","true","165.7"," 26 of 41 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","26","41","0","0"

This game while utilizing the same engine and universe as those previous titles feels a lot different from those games which is an  RPG of tactical combat with some civilization elements.\n\nYou start the game as a soveriegn which each has a very different set of skills and different beginning spells. You can pick one of the 6 or customize your sovereign's starting hero and spellbooks which give you access to spells of a certain type (wrath is damage, summon is summon creatures). You'll start with a single city and expand from there going on quests fighting monsters and bandits and eventually the sorcerer king himself before he can cast a spell which is measured in the dooms day counter.\n\nYou'll want to watch the dev streams on stardock's youtube channel to get a clearer idea of how the game works but that's it in a nutshell. The things that still need work are some minor bugs (there's the occassional having to click turn button twice, missing icons for tile yields and odd spell effects) but nothing to break the game and these have been improved and fixed over time. There's also some unit abilities that need more clearer definition in what they do and some AI improvements to make the other minor factions more aggressive.\n\nOne of the chief concerns I had playing this game when I first started in the beta was this going to have much replay value after the first few games. Suffice I was surprised to find myself keeping coming back to it and looking forward to each game and I realized the main reason: It's fun.\n\nThe game's not overally complicated with research, and deep-seeded strategy, though there is some. It's game of you leading a group of units leveling your hero, making choices that have an impact on the game and killing a bunch of monsters and enemies.  The quests are fun to read, you can ally yourself with fire and elemantal creatures that each their own personality and abilities. You'll get some awesome units over the course of the game, find cool loot and find some great comboes (though a few are a bit much even though I love Varda the Slayer's combo of abilities)\n\nSince playing the Beta the game has come a long way in everything from content, features and units. If you're looking for the ultimate ground-breaking RPG civilization game hybrid this may be worth a try though you may want something richer. If you like fun, want to play with cool characters, make meaningful choices and the thought of having a bear named Ben annihlate whole armies then this defintely worth your time.\n\nIt's an excellent start for new game and looking forward to future expansions and content. Would love to see them expand into using more of the ocean with possible naval units and cycling out different bosses for you to face before the sorcerer king.","July 26, 2015","true","135.0"," 14 of 19 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","14","19","0","0"

It is not!  Some elements and concepts are the same but the game has been dumbed down and made more childish.  The graphics feel more like they were designed for a childrens game.  And all the logistical strategy elements have been removed to simplify the game (again this may be an attempt to make it easier for 10 yr olds to play).  There are no shard variations, no money, no unreast, no different city types, no design your own units, no city layout designs,   .  It has all been simplified down to a cute little game with no need to worry about these strategy elements.\n\nThe combat is improved and has a nice feel, the crafting (I use this term loosly) system feels fake, the overall game goals (doomsday counter) feel stupid and unfun (my counter was at 10% before I even got 22 seasons in).  The loot managment has been very improved and probably the best feature of the game.  You can give equiptment to reg troops or even share potions (I wish this element would be added to FE).\n\nIf your a fan of FE you may be disappointed by what they have done to the game overall.

Yes, it has a certain charm.\n\nCan I recommend this game?  If you find this in the $5-10 range, then I'd say it's worth trying.  More than that, and why I'm putting this as a no, lay with my problems below.\n\nI'd picked this came up on the strength of Stardock's Fallen Enchantress: Legendary Heroes.  I'd figured this would be a minor iteration of that technology.  Sadly, I was wrong as this game is a large step back from FE.\n\nThe problems I found included:  User-hostile UI.  Trying to find unit levels, character honor/compassion/etc scores, or any other similar feedback was a chore.\nTiny font.  The default font in game is someplace between miniscule and Liliputian.  It's a bad enough sin to warrant a separate item.\nFragility of units.  You need units, like archers, to do most any task.  Yet time and again they get annihilated while being barely able to do anything.  Yes you can gear and enchant them - but it doesn't matter as much as their leveling.\nGraphics.  Boring at best, head-scratchingly bad at worst.  A huge sin here, in my eyes, but where's the textures on the city expansions?  It's like spare Monopoly pieces are just plopped down.   The city mini-map is also near useless as it's from the same land as the font.\nDepth, or lack of it.  There is a fine balance between complex and simple in game design.  Balancing that leads to depth.  There's none of that here as any shade of complexity is missing.  Like others have said, it's like this is meant for an iPad or other soft platform.\nBuilt in sarcasm.  In my first play-through as the guardian all of my text choices (and a fair numbed of description boxes) were filled with snarky sarcasm.  Why?  Immersion is broken by forcing another voice onto the player.  As a player I should have at least been given adequate control to adjust my tone.\nMagic system isn't very magical.  Particularly the terrain altering spells.  Beaches are immortal, you can't raise them - it's just a mana sink.  Big mana to convert shadow tiles to normal...but only one tile - never worth the mana.","August 9, 2015","false","21.4"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

Very similar mechanics and play styles as the previous two installments, with a few very different changes and additions. I'll elaborate later on.\n\nI DO recommend this game.\n\nOverall score: 30/40 = 75%\n\nCategory        Score                Graphics        7/10                Gameplay        8/10                Sound and Music        6/10                Replayability        9/10\nMain Review\nThe main premise of this game takes place after the story line of the previous games in this series, notably Fallen Enchantress: Legendary Heroes. After defeating the Fallen Enchantress, the world is in tatters, all of the Kingdoms and Empires scattered and broken. Your avatar rises to take the lead of your faction, and must rally against the Sorcerer King to prevent the world being destroyed as he attains Godhood.\n\nSimilar to the previous games, you start with a Hero unit, with some minor units in his/her army. Your hero can found your first city, and then will usually be used to explore the surrounding territory. All over this land there are hostile NPC monsters, bandits, and demons, which you can fight or avoid. These hostile "mobs" typically start off fairly weak, but as time goes on, they do get stronger and more aggressive. There are also treasure chests and quest locations, which will give you items or ingredients, and gain experience for the units that complete those quests.\n\nThis installment adds some new mechanics, most notably the Doomsday Counter, in order to keep the player progressing. Every so often, the counter will tick up, and if it ever fills up all the way, the Sorcerer King will cast the Spell of Making and destroy the realm, becoming a God in the process.\n\nGraphics\n7/10\n\nSame graphics style as the previous games, which isn't photorealistic, but for this type of game, it works really well. I decided to give this one a 7 out of 10, simply based on there being a few odd glitches here and there. One of them being that when you are zoomed out far enough the map changes to a "cloth" style map. This will actually speed up the game as it no longer needs to render so much information. However, when you complete a build order in one of your cities, it will change to the normal style map for a second or two, then switch back to your cloth map. It will usually end up having some tearing and stuttering, with the worst being a CTD (crash to desktop).\n\nGameplay\n8/10\n\nThe gameplay runs really similar to the previous games, so if you're a veteran of those you will feel right at home. You are a Sovereign, who guides a fledgling band of ragtag heroes into a mighty Kingdom, able to destoy the Sorcerer King, preventing the destruction of your home.\n\nAs the Sovereign, you are able to cast a multitude of spells, from different Books. Some spells will affect your cities, adding extra production or food and such. Others are on the "strategic" level, affecting the map as a whole, like raising mountains or making land suitable for settling. There are spells that are used during tactical battles, allowing you to heal your units, speed them up, or directly damage the enemy units, just to name a few.\n\nYou start with a single "Hero" level unit, along with a couple of minor units in that army. This starting hero can found your first city, with the spawn point usually being the best spot to start off with. A big difference between this game and the previous games, is that instead of paying wages in gold for your armies, you instead generate Logistics which is used at 1 per unit. Various buildings within your cities will improve how much Logistics you make, which in turn pays for larger armies. All of the units, hero and normal, can equip items, like armour and accesories, improving various aspects. One notable thing to remember is that while the hero level units can change their starting weapons, normal level units cannot. All units can gain experience, leading to leveling up, which improves their base stats. You are also able to improve your units by upgrading them once you have researched a higher tier in weapons or armour and so on. This is done simply by selecting the unit you wish to upgrade, and using the "upgrade" order, bringing up a dialog which has your upgrade options.\n\nCities are few and far between in this game, habitable areas being hard to find. While this does make it harder to establish a sprawling Kingdom, it forces you to focus instead on the few cities you do control, and improve them at a steady rate. There are many different buildings to add to your cities, most of them adding basic resources or improving your research rates. Your cities won't add the buildings physically on the map, like the previous games did. There are resources out on the map that your faction can claim, such as metal and crystal. Each node will only add a limited finite amount of resources, instead of generating a set amount per turn, limiting how you use these resources.\n\nFinally, instead of having to rely on finding and buying your equipments and items, you can instead craft them. This is new in this game, adding alot more options for customizing your units. Most treasure chests will produce the ingredients used in crafting, with the chests being fairly abundant, the materials are easily obtained. Certain building will also make your resource nodes produce some of these crafting materials regularily, adding a steady income. There is many, many different reciepies for crafting, some added through research, some added through buildings, and some added through quests. There are so many that I havent discovered them all yet, even with the amount of play time I have logged.\n\nSound and Music\n6/10\n\nI found the sound rather lackluster, falling flat at times. This game is an epic 4x strategy, with sweeping stories and fantastic battles, but the music fails to live up to that standard. While it does not inspire greatness, it also isn't annoying and works just fine as background noise.\n\nThe battle sounds, like sword strikes and spell blasts sound rather canned, like the devs simply didn't decide to put as much effort into that part as they did almost everything else.\n\nReplayability\n9/10\n\nWhile the campaign is a one shot deal, as in it never really changes, the replayability is in the skirmish mode. Random maps, with adjustable difficulties, and many different rival factions, make no two games alike. While you can only play as the Kingdom faction, you can pick one of six leaders, with different perks and powers. Each is tailored to a particular gameplay style, but can be customized to play however you want.\n\nSummary\nI would highly recommend this game, it is a fun way to while away your time. The strategy is deep, the gameplay is rich, and it keeps the "one more turn" feeling going strong. It has a few issues, but what game doesn't?\n\nExcellent game, 30 out of 40! Now get out there and save the world of the Sorcerer King!","October 11, 2015","true","24.7"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","10","14","0","0"

Considering it's brand new and not a high price, it's a good one to pick up and sink some hours into. The learning curve is extremely minimal, only taking between 60-90 minutes to grasp the basic mechanics, and then you're quickly onto more advanced strategies and higher levels of aggression. I never found the AI to be devastating however, even on insane difficulties. Sure it would endlessly harass my shards/kingdoms - being a nusance as opposed to a legitimate threat, but it would  never stress me or lure me out.\n\nThe AI often opts to win by default, by which I mean it throws medium forces at your main force to cause attrition (this doesn't affect the AI because, of course, it has infinite resources and unit production). This also has the effect of causing the 'doom timer' to tick by as you're paralyzed by endless harrying. Sure I guess it's a legitimate battle tactic, but if quickly gets tiresome; it's not intelligence, it's simply an abuse of resource advantage.\n\nThis is more of a game that attempts to hook you in and then by your own desire you explore the various leader characters and their stats/spells (increasing play time). They do often provide an interesting twist and the skirmish maps were varied enough in scope/scale/challenges/uniqueness that I gave most of them a full playthrough prior to this review.\n\nI haven't experiened any significant bugs or crashes aside from one particular frustrating element. When casting hypnosis on specific enemy units (wargs especially) the game would often freeze up on the next manual battle; causing a soft crash. The only cure was to either disband the unit or place them in a keep as stalwart defenders. It's troublesome because hypnosis costs resources and those converted units typically have a good hit point to damage ratio, making them worthwhile units to steal from the enemy. On higher difficulties this ability can really turn the battle and keep things interesting, it's just a shame it causes so much grief (at time of review).\n\nThat singular issue  aside however, I have had no other crashes or even bugs in the game; it's surprisingly robust. Your experience may vary (the other reviews on here do seem to have had trouble), but frankly I would assume it to be a problem with your system before the game's.\n\nIt's a good 7.5/10. It's fairly inexpensive, can create some fun adventures (I hypnotised Kevin the Dragon and used his mega Charizard flame burst to literally burn my way to the enemies citadel), and has a good sense of humour in the writing and gameplay. Pick it up if you get a chance.","August 3, 2015","true","29.0"," 13 of 20 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","13","20","0","2"

One of the great things about the combat is that you can "Auto-Resolve" so that you don't actually have to go into the fight yourself. Personally, I only ever used it when it said "Overwhelming Victory" because I found that sometimes when it just said "Victory" that I might lose a faction, so I participated in those battles just to be safe.\n2. You have main "Heroes" that you can gather than can lead your armies (yes plural) and you can also make alliances with other kingdoms in order to take down the Sorcerer King. One of the things you have to keep in mind thoughi is that even though you may have gotten an alliance with another kingdom, that ensures that you can't ally with another kingdom because in Dark Ages past, one of them took the other's chewtoy, so Timmy won't be friends with you because your friends with Sasha, who tripped Timmy and embarrassed him in front of the girl he liked. I wished that I could have alligned with everyong, but it simply won't happen in this game.\n3. At the time of posting this, I have only played 1 game, and that was 17.7 hours long, on Beginner difficulty. Even on beginner, I was faced with many challenges (including learning the game) which definitely kept me on my toes, and still kept the Sorcerer King at the end a challenging battle. (I mean come on, he 1 hit my Heroes, and I only had 1 left at the end of the battle, and I really like my Ranger!)\n4. You can equip your Heroes with armor, 6 accessory slots (rings, necklaces, capes, etc.), sword/shield/staff when appropriate, not to mention you can enchant these items. The only annoying thing is that you can't give any weapons to those who aren't your Heroes (even though you can give them accessories and armor...)\n5. As the role of the Sovereign, you raise your solitary kingdom into a vast empire in order to combat the Sorcerer King, and you yourself have special abilities where you can assist your armies on the battlefield by casting buffs or summoning extra monsters, and you can use various other abilities while in the Tactical Map.\n6. It takes Mana and various other things in order to be successful, so when you start out for the first time, I recommend starting on Beginner just so you can learn the basics without having to worry about others aligning with the Sorcerer King too quickly.\n7. A really neat aspect is that there is technically a time limit on your match. The Sorcerer King is attempting to cast "Doomsday" which will automatically end the game, but you can do many things to prevent it. From the way I played, the highest he ever got was 23/500. By the end of the game, I brought him back to 0. There are many things you can do on the Tactic Map like go to Abandoned Villages, engage in battle, setup Kingdoms and Strongholds, obtain Crystals (Very important!), visit Markets, discuss alliances with others, and more!\n8. Wonderful humor! For example: At one time I took my party and we went into a dungeon, and it went something along the lines of this: "Up ahead you see twin ogres sorting supplies for the Sorcerer King's armies. In fact, now that you think about it, all ogres kind of look the same. You racist." On top of that, you can make "Indifferent" choices, "Courageous" choices, "Honorable" choices, "Wise" choices, and more! The most you have of each, the more options you have to use when in a conversation or making choices, like a "Wisdom" choice I made at one point had me talking with a bunch of Wizards studying for their final about the Sorcerer King, and I joined in to talk about my hands-on experiences, or an "Honorable" choice was choosing not to pilfer through graves.\nIt's all good fun, and takes a good amount of time to get stuff done. I found it extremely enjoyable, and definitely recommend it! If you're still unsure, you might want to watch a playthrough and see if it's the thing for you, but I found pretty much everything about this game flawless and a pleasure to play.","July 22, 2015","true","17.7"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","9","14","0","0"

Unfortunately, the innovation and the work stop there.  Game lacks polish and the idea is poorly implemented (compared to FE).  Details below:\n\nEssence and city creation - city is now a 5x5 grid, so you cannot snake your way around to the good resources like it FE.  However, the ZOC alleviate the resource issues... what killed it is the lack of essence availability.  Problem gotten a lot worst compared to FE.  Hope they can fix it by 1.4+\n\nCrafting - problematic in getting the required mats.  Wolf pelts, which you need for the starting leather armor, is more difficult to secure than the iron for the chain armor (next tier).  This is rather problematic end game, especially for the tinkerer merchants (e.g. cannot get enough radiant diamonds, or demon horn for the legendary equipment that your skill tree unlocks/only tinkerer can craft).\n\nEnchantment - this was tacked on for the sake of having "item enchantment".  When you have a stack of 15 units, all with 12 pieces of equipment...  UI will list all of the items, which make finding things to enchant a pain.  When you enchant an item, it gets moved to the bottom of the list while your cursor stays where it used to be, preventing you from efficiently enchanting an item multiple times (tinkerer can enchant an item 4x).\n\nMagic & Spellbook feels really underwhelming in SK.  In one of my game, I selected 8 enchant spell books to try and acquire more unit enchant spells.  I got a total of 4... and been told that I got 8 nice item enchant in the enchantment system instead... (which competes against crafting for mats).  In another game, I picked 4 summons and 4 enchant spell books... I got more unit enchant spells this way... so let's try and figure out how the game works:\n\nWiki/Help - official wiki might as well not be there, because stardocks has made no effort other than setting up a very generic shell.  In game help/spell list is copies over from FE (with some old unused items), and is equally unhelpful in finding/figuring which spell books give what.  Civ has a much better built in help that Stardocks need to start mirroring.\n\nAdventure/Quest - while the sorcerer king can temp you with goodies that increase the doomsday counter by 5, the quests from goodie huts can reverse some of that progress.  As the quest locations are fixed, you can plan around it.\n\nBugs - still plenty, such as roads not working in the campaign once your outpost added more roads on top of it.  But it is bearable/Not as bad as WoM.\n\nOverall, it is a good first attempt by the team to break out of Stardock's 4X mold and add some freshness in the genre.  But you need to find the courage to think outside the box, and not get tie down by your roots.  More importantly, you need to answer how playing the same thing as diffirent soverign is going to be fun for the gamers?  The game, in its current state, stops being engaging once you figure out how to manage the doomsday counter.\n\n\nTLDR, stick with FE.  You will have fun with it for about 10-15 hours, until you figure out what's buried under the nice looking carpet.  If you need a change, go play AOW or Endless XXX.","October 6, 2015","false","81.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The whole game is full of fun little tidbits, from the dialogue options when you go to goody huts to the diplomacy with other races.  The one big problem I am having is that the different possibly lords you can pick seem incredibly unbalanced.  Some have special powers that are nigh useless (pay a huge chunck of mana to maybe convert an enemy when it would be easier to just kill them), while the straight-combat based on can allow all his units to take their turn immediately for the same price.  I don't need to tell you how overpowered it can be to get the first turn for all your units before the enemy can even move.\n\nSo overall a good single-player game, if a bit repetative on repeat playthroughs","November 14, 2015","true","45.7"," 10 of 17 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","10","17","0","0"

I think it was Rock Paper Shotgun that put it "The game actually starts after you LOST the last one."  The evil dictator won the war and graciously let you live, battered and bloody.  You have to slowly build up a team of fighters while refining your own magic, courting allies, and crafting weapons and armor.  At the same time, the big baddy will court your rivals and try to keep you in check while Doomsday approaches.  The point is a balancing act of expanding but staying under the big bad's notice and ahead of his Doomsday Schedule.\n\nDon't be too afraid of that timer, though.  The land is littered in little quest-huts, many of which give you options to slow down the timer.  You can also build (one time) structure in your cities, cast a spell (high cost and cooldown, but repeatable), or beseach a few allies you make to slow down the timer.  I actually beat my first playthrough (on normal) with the counter pushed back down to 0! Think of it less as a timer and more of another resource you need to manage.  Some heroes and abilities even gain power as the timer increases (like production bonus to cities), but if the timer gets too high your population will succumb to despair.  The thralls do nothing but tie up army points of yours... so as I said, its  just something you learn to manage.\n\nThe main campaign gets pretty stale pretty quickly, though.  The problem is that even the quest huts are static, so you can devise presice strategies to jumpstart your early game like "go south to this inn to recruit this extra unit+quest attribute that lets you bypass the early area and expand quicker so you can then quickly grab this unguarded magic shard...." etc.\n\nThere is a random map generator to help alleviate this.  The map size is smaller, but it allows you to play as the other character classes without banging your head into your desk at how stale the campaign can get after a few playthroughs.  The basic core of the game (collect ingredients, train and equip a killer squad, RPG-lite aspect of overthrowing a would-be god) are still solid enough to make the random map scenarious a joy.\n\nOverall I whole-heartedly reccomend the game.  The devs should continue making content for the game (they specifically mentioned letting you play as other factions), so there will be more to come!","March 10","true","27.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

You can craft items which is nice and the city upgrades are useful. However, the lack of diversity in monsters makes the turn base combat a little lack luster after awhile. Placing roads can be annoying, can't disband units, no multiplayer, no hotkey list or the option to rebind your keys and the music goes from good to just annoying. Lack of diversity. Most quest are not voice acted and some graphical glitches. No mod tools or support so I don't see much replay value. The ending was short. However, for a TBS RPG it's not bad.

I don't know if it was worth the $40 I paid for it but if I get to 100 hours then I think it will be worth it.  Here are some of the reasons why I like this game...\n\n1.  The game is relatively easy to pick up.  It took me a few restarts but once I got how the progression worked through the game, I started to enjoy it a lot.  Again I am new to this genre so thats just me learning.\n2.  The sovereigns make how you play so much different.  If  you pick the commander sovereign, he makes your army more powerful through talents tthat increase their stats when you make them in your cities, and by the number of army slots you can have in each army.  The guardian sovereign makes it to where your outposts can really control the map by making their zone of control larger...much larger.  The tinkerer allows you to craft a whole lot of different items rather quickly, allows more enchant slots on each item, and allows for certain unique recipes.  An example of this is the arrows you can make that go into accessory slots for archers.  Making these and fully enchanting them can makes things a bit too easy though I have found out, especially if you picked the ranger hero.\n3.  The map is full of plenty of things to explore.  The campaign map is rather large and uncovering it all will take quite a long time.\n4.  The graphics on everything seem to be really smooth and the sound effects are on point.\n\nAlong with the good are the bad.  Here are a few examples of them...\n1.  The AI is rather dull in this game.  I am only playing on the default difficulty setting since im new to this type of game, but I find the map easy to controll for the most part because the sorcerer kings army is not that bright.  They don't attack often enough.\n2.  There is no way to save an army composition.  If you move one of your armies into a city, you have to drag each unit 1 by 1 out of the city and reform the army.  This is a bit annoying.\n3.  The doomsday counter seems too easy to control.  I really feel no sense of urgency because I can keep the doomsday counter down to 0 most of the time.  I think the amount of quests that reduce this counter should be reduced.\n4.  Very little difference in army options no matter what sovereign you play.  Certain sovereigns have special units you can unlock through their talent tree but unit options seems too limited at the moment.  The mages are useless, there's no healer unless you go with the cleric sovereign (unless i'm mistaken), the archers are crap unless you have the ranger hero or you went the tinkerer sovereign.\n5.  There's a bug that effects your spells.  I've noticed that if you messed up and want to reload one of the autosaves, the last spell that you learned will show back in your learning queue.  This is really annoying, especially in the beginning part of the game.\n\nThere are good and bad points to the game but I find it overall enjoyable.  I really don't have room to compare this game to others because I'm new to this type of game so I'm sorry for that.  I hope this helps some people decide.  I will be updating this review as I go.","July 28, 2015","true","69.1"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

There are still hard choices to make, but you won't spend a lot of time analyzing menus, you can make your choices quickly and move on to the combat.\n\nThe tactical combat is fun, though you'll often want to "Autoresolve" and the autoresolve is more reliable this time than in Legendary Heroes.\n\nThe game is almost like a tower defense game mixed into a 4X, and that gives it a fresh feel. You need to keep magical nodes on the map alive, while your enemy tries to destroy them. Meanwhile, your heroes level up in powerhouses, and you need to pres the advantage against your foe to assault his main citadel.\n\nThe 'neutral faction' feature that is still forthcoming is partially present, and it seems to hold a lot of promise.\n\nThe quests are varied and well-written, giving you more to do than only fight the war.\n\nVery excited to see how this improves from here, I recommend giving it a shot while you can get the beta discount.","October 8, 2014","true","104.7"," 16 of 30 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","16","30","0","0"

You are trying to stop an already advanced and strong AI empire from destroying magical shards placed around the map to end the game. The games looks are improved over Fallen Enchantress and Legendary Heroes while also feeling further along in development (and more fun to play) than Stardock's other beta game Galactic Civilizations III at this point in time.\n\nThe big thing currently missing is the minor factions/diplomacy system which is expected in the next couple of weeks. Apart from that along with a lack of race and map customization (which are currently locked), the game is a lot of fun to play and runs well with minimal bugs.

(Sorry, but it was so bad)\n-Skill and Kingdom Progression is very satisfying, and there are many branches to develop.\n-Not much micro-management, you don't get confused with too many little things.\n-UI is simply the best in this genre. Everything is under your view and control. Easily accessible.\n-Writing is superb. You will have great fun with the amazing sense of humour. Unique to this game, there are dozens of side quests scattered around the map, and not a single one of them are the same. Each quest has a unique writing.\n-Main quest and Sorcerer King's Doomsday system is very unique and entertaining.\n-Still getting updates and patches.\n\nCons:\n- No multiplayer. Even though the game is turn-based.\n- Not much replayibility as there is only one campaign and one map. Each time, the map is randomized, but the factions/mainquest spots are unchanged.\n- AI gets dumb at some points. Needs some work.\n- Sounds go mute sometimes, for very short periods.\n- Sense of humour might be too much for some people who are looking for a serious story.\n- There are some imbalanced abilities on certain heroes (Yes, i am looking at you Drogon the constantly taking turns dwarf)","January 22","true","11.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Having been a fan of Galactic Civilizations 2, Fallen Enchantress Legendary Heroes, and to a lesser extent Galactic Civilizations 3, it seemed like a no brainer to try Stardock's latest entry in the Elemental series, especially when Steam had it on sale for less than $12.  I like it and recommend it, with some caveats.  Fans of previous elemental games who are expecting the full 4X experience that Legendary Heroes has will be a bit disappointed.  Sorcerer King feels more like a subgenre spinoff of Legendary Heroes than a true sequel.  While there is exploration, expansion, exploitation of resources, and extermination of foes, all of these things are dialed back in favor of the game's main objective which is to defeat the sorcerer king.  Instead of negotiating trade agreements with other kingdoms, you are now simply attempting to gain their favor so that they will aid you against the Sorcerer King (though the aid really seems to be in name only... I never witnessed any of my allies sending troops to fend off the Sorcerer King's armies).  Alternatively, you can choose to go to war with them and wipe them out, or if they become the Sorcerer King's thralls they will permanently declare war against you.  Also, let's talk about the Doomsday Clock.  It's actually not as bad as it sounds.  Yes, the Sorcerer King does keep building up the timer to doomsday, and when the game first starts and the timer rises it seems pretty hopeless.  Then as you gain power, you find ways to turn back the timer so it's really kind of a non issue.  By the endgame I had completely turned the timer back to zero.\n\nIn addition to the trimmed down diplomacy options, the game is also missing one of the best features of previous Elemental games, which is the dragons!  Sure, they were incredibly overpowered, but who didn't love taking over a dragon cave and growing their very own nuclear option that was sure to turn the tide of almost any battle?  Also instead of the many titans that showed up in Legendary Heroes, this game has only two which must be defeated for one of the possible paths to victory.\n\nSo overall, I enjoyed Sorcerer King though not as much as Legendary Heroes.  For replay value, Legendary Heroes has so much more to do.  However if you enjoy the Elemental series, or Stardock games in general, it's worth picking up and trying, especially if you find it on sale.","February 6","true","48.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I think it's important to understand that this is a different type of game than Fallen Enchantress/Legendary Heroes. That was more of a traditional 4X while this launches you into an a-symetric war story.\n\nPros -\n1) Good mechanics, deep enough to provide an initial challenge, but not a frustrating learning curve\n2) Good lore/story built into play - the player makes choices that matter really frequently\n3) Smooth but not awe inspiring graphics (its a 4X game, presumably this is what they're going for)\n4) Crafting - has gotten mixed responses with some people saying it's not powerful enough, I find it to be well balanced in terms of time spent crafting to advantage it gives in battle\n\nCons -\n1) Replayability - On the plus side I played at least a half dozen games on different map sizes and difficulty levels, both of which give a different experience to the game, however:\ni) Unfortunately after a couple play throughs you realize that there is an optimal way to build every city and there is no queue, so that means going back to each city every time you build something to figure out where you are in that city's build order (annoying)\nii) Limited number of units and balance between them in the late game makes strategic decisions at the end of the game much easier than at the begining and needs to be developed more, such as balance between mounted units (most powerful) and magical units (severly under powered)\n2) Stats and tooltips - Some states just aren't explained anywhere, like Spell Mastery, which seems like it could be important, but I still have no idea after 50 hours\n\nAnyone still reading has seen that despite a couple of issues I have with the game (as of version 1.0), I still reccomended it. Expect to get 40-80 hours of enjoyment out of the game and then have basically played out the various senarios running into replayabilty walls... if 40-80 hours of entertainment is worth $40 then by all means go for it because I haven't regretted any of the time I spent playing.","August 13, 2015","true","59.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gormless/recommended/241990/","gormless","Indrid","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gormless/","132 products in account","A competant and fun 4X game that doesn't really excel at anything and lacks replayability.  Worth the new low price, especially on sale.\n\nThe game never quite feels at ease with what it's trying to do; there is a dissonance in almost every aspect.  The serious marketing ("How do you kill a God?") and gloomy premise (bad guy in charge) seems at odds with the almost cartoony visuals and humurous writing.\n\nThe economic and city-building aspect of the game is so basic and forgettable that you wonder why it's in the game.  It's like Stardock didn't want to fully commit to the nature of the title; building your own stack of doom.  The key of enjoying the game then becomes; how do you build the stack of doom?  Turns out, it's like most other 4X but stripped down.\n\nThe almost literal handful of units you can train from your cities is adequate at best, and boring at worst.  "Soldier", "Pikeman".  Really?  Even when you pick up a named unit with slightly different stats from one of the (well written) quests, they are usually just slightly different versions of these with the same model and animations.\n\nEach Sovereign (your character "class") has access to a unique starting Champion with their retinue, and one or two unique units.  These are the only things that have any character, and unfortunately your first Champion's retinue are not often good enough for end game, so you're left with the champions.  The Champions are cool, there's just nowhere near enough of them.  The ones that are there even share some aspects of their skill trees.  This is because the meat of the game, combat, is quite lacking.\n\nYou spend a lot of time fighting in Sorcerer King.  The battles are decent scale in terms of amount of units you can control, but they take place in tiny arenas.  There is no room for manoevre or really move at all.  You are right on top of each other.  This was obviously done to speed up the battles, but they went a bit too far.  You know what other 4X has a lot of focus on army building and combat? Age of Wonders 3, which has flanking, area of influence, range, sight blocking along with a massive selection of units.  It does this without the battles feeling any more of a chore than they do in Sorcerer King which lacks most of that nuance.\n\nSorcerer King makes some strange decisions with regards to balance.  Ranged units are able to target enemies wherever they are on the map.  This makes them immediate targets all the time since you can't hide from them, and makes for weird battles where the ranged back lines shoot at each other while the melee units try to reach them.  Another big dropped ball was the way the game handles initiative.  It's turn-based, and turn order is determined by initiative.  Fine.  The game then screws this up by giving you various ways, including a low level spell, to boost initiative.  Which then makes it the go-to thing to boost however you can, since you can often destroy an enemy army without them getting any turns.  This could have been solved by simply having initiative be a strictly inate statistic, or improved only very rarely.  Sorcerer King: The Search for Initiative.\n\nThe premise is cool, it gives you a singular focus; "I need to make an awesome stack for a boss fight at the end".  Unfortunately any adventure is drained from the experience as it plays out in typically the same way.  There are plenty of quests, but they mostly consist of reading some funny text and then fighting something, typically very easy even if they are labelled as "strong".  It's a fantasy world full of magic where not much interesting stuff happens.  If I'm building a stack, make that stack amazing.  Fill it with characters that you did awesome things with to get there.  But you didn't.  You read some text and fought some wolves, or you clicked a button and trained a cookie-cutter "Sentinel" (not as cool as it sounds)  from your emotionless city.  You can even recruit a Champion by simply selecting a skill on your skill tree.  Narratively justified?  Yes, perhaps, it could be regarded as a reflection of your fame.  But they could have tried to make it narratively interesting.\n\nSorcerer King is a game I wanted to love. A 4X that has me doing something other than running around and destroying enemy cities against poor AI.  They just didn't go all out with it, so you end up doing a lot of the same things anyway.  There is a crafting system, and it starts of cool but descends into tedium as you try to keep your stack not only equipped but those equipped items also enchanted (why can't I do them at the same time??) with an interface that just can't keep up.  Simple things let it down.  When you craft an item, you can have it instantly sent to a unit.  Cool right?  Does it give you a drop-down or grid or list to choose them from?  No, you get a singular field that you must click arrows to cycle through.\n\nI am still recommending this game.  It is an overall fun if short experience, with more time in the oven it could have been epic.  I'm not a fan of the visual style myself, but it's clean and there is enjoyment to be had with building your stack of death.  I paid £8-something and got over 15 hours, so that's good value in my book.  Are there better fantasy 4X games out there?  Yes, but this one is worth a play and could get significantly better if supported with DLC.","January 23","true","24.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It melds together strong aspects of strategy, tactical and RPG games. It also presents a very balanced mix of physical combat and magical combat, conquering the land by clearing it and colonizing it while delaying the advance of the enemy's own conquest, especially the progress of the Doomsday bar, finding and using resources wisely,  researching and making use of spells with temperance. I found that, at its core, it was a game of balance, of equilibrium; you are constantly walking on a suspended rope, and you can only fall once!\n\nThe graphics are very good, lively and colourful (with a reservation; see observations below). The music is repeatitive, but aptly accompanies the themes of the game, setting a good, heroic playing mood.\n\nThis being said, a few observations are called for.\n\n>The lack of a gamer's manual introduces several problems. It is difficult to understand the meaning of colour codes, for example, without a legend. Game rules have to be discovered as one plays, which presents some interesting late of mid- game... surprises.\n\nLet us continue with the User Interface.\n\n>When casting the "Heal" spell on an army, why are we shown units in full health? It IS a healing spell. Units in full health hardly require it.\n\n>Speaking of that 'healing window', another observation comes to mind. When one selects a unit's icon to become the recipient of the healing effect, it does become very slightly haloed in light blue that hardly stands out against the black background. I supposed I just betrayed my age, but mine poor eyes struggle to verify that the correct unit has been highlighted. Wouldn't it be possible to produce a highlight that stands out much more sharply? I understand that blue is the 'universal' colour for 'good effects' in games nowadays, but how about a more luminescent light blue? Also, do those icons absolutely need to be stacked so closely? If a larger space were managed around each, a halo would be easier to distinguish.\n\n>In the city window, over half the space available is taken up by a 'prettily drawn, pretty' picture of an idealized medieval castle. Well done! The actual information windows are very small and, as a result, the useful information is cramped. However, this is not the worst here. The bottom left side panel shows an overview of the city's 5x5 map with very important information regarding the yield of each plot (or tile). This information is not available anywhere else in the game. The icons representing each building your city has produced are lined at the top of this map; once the city has reached maturity, you are unable to see the topmost row of plots, at all. The information you need to decide in which direction you should expand your city's territy, for example, is lost in part, making it difficult to take an informed decision. As far as I'm concerned, this is a design fault. The icons should have been lined down at the right side of the pretty picture, detracting a bit from its amazing awesomeness, no doubt, but allowing us to see what's really important to play intelligently.\n\n>Speaking of terrain information, one needs to play extensively to understand that there are really two types of 'pastures' in this game: the rich land that can be settled is dark green (Fertile Land) while the exploitable but 'un-settleble' land is a lime green (Grassland). Yes, one noticed the two colours upon beginning to play, but nothing indicated their meanings, which brings us back to the lack of a gamer's manual. When a settler is selected, the dark green tiles show their yield, which is fine, but other lighter green ones amidst them do not, nor do forests or any other tile. How does one make an informed decision in these circumstances? Select the finest dark green tile, optimally located and hope for the best?\nThat's shoddy strategy. This needs to be addressed. Shadowed yield icons on tiles that cannot be settled, perhaps?\n\n> I ought to add that an option should exist, in game, to allow the gamer to see at all times tile yields; I am thinking of a toggle. One may want to see the yields for a while to take decisions, then turn this information off to return to a 'normalized' landscape.\n\n>Having to select a spell in three steps each time you need to use it can be annoying and tiresome, especially if you are spamming 'Heal' on an army of 12-15 units, some of which may require several healings. Healing and terraforming spells are frequently used on the strategy map, while combat and summoning spells are used on the tactical map. Why can we not have the use of quick spell bars in each? I'm thinking of the type of bar that permits one to drag and drop spell icons into empty slots, allowing direct access to frequently used spells [Make it a 10-slot bar. Thanks!]. Using the spell book should be reserved for infrequently called upon spells.\n\nI am a great fan of building and terraforming. I love to produce maps that are just so. Yes, I am a 'reformed' perfectionist. Forcing myself to apply stamps crookedly on a stack of 100 envelopes taught me a measure of practicality, but once a perfectionist... A couple of things struck me about terraforming.\n\n>Although one can research a 'Road' spell at some point, roads are mostly laid out by the program to connect together the various cities and outposts one builds. This is useful and very, very mana economical, but presents one disadvantage; once a road passes through a tile, it is no longer possible to build a village there to exploit its resources or to create a resource using a spell, or to terraform said tile. The problem arises from the gamer's inability to remove a road segment. Once a tile has been amended and built upon, a road can be built or re-built without compromising the changes made. A spell to remove roads is sorely needed!\n\n>If I have understood the hierarchy of soils correctly, they are tiered from totally dead (burnt, dead, sand, swampish, etc.), barren, grassland, fertile. The gardener and soil expert in me caught the hiccups upon realizing that sand was classified as dead; desert sand is unproductive because of the absence of water, to wit: oasises. A sandy loam is actually an ideal medium for the production of perfect carrots and potatoes. This being written, I must recognize the creative license of the game's designers. However, when it comes to being unable to change grassland (light green) into fertile land (dark green) while one can change a lower grades of land into fertile land, such as barren land into fertile land or dead land into grassland or even fertile land, I find this quite ridiculous. Such a spell would be mana demanding since it would push a tile all the way up to the very top of the pyramid of fertily, granted, but it should exists in my humble opinion. How many times have I found myself unable to found the city I have been spending hundreds, nay thousands of units of mana to prepare because THE tile that needed to be fertile was merely exploitable? And why are we able to lower entire mountanous areas into grassland this is unusable for purposes of settling? I suppose you intended us to be only able to leverage the one or three mountains in the zone of control of a city, but gamers armed with such a powerful too have other ideas. I'm sorry to say this chaps, but deal with it.\n\nIn spite of these observations, which address minor aspects of the game, when all is told I warmly recommend this game to lovers of strategy, tactical and RPG gamers.","October 15, 2015","true","173.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sanahtlig/recommended/241990/","sanahtlig","sanahtlig","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sanahtlig/","7 products in account","A game that combines strategy and RPG mechanics all in one package.  Using the same formula as the venerable Lords of Magic and its predecessor Fallen Enchantress, Sorcerer King incrementally improves the formula and manages to build an interesting fantasy setting while it's at it.  With tongue-in-cheek mini-quests that spice up the exploration, as well as a doomsday timer that doesn't let the player simply turtle and assemble an overwhelming army, Sorcerer King manages to maintain a pacing that sometimes eludes long campaign-based strategy games with one big map to explore.  Like the better 4x games, this is a game that grabs you and keeps prodding you to keep going.  I'm 20 hours into the campaign and I've only explored half the map, so we're looking at 40-50 hours for one playthrough.\n\nVersus Fallen Enchantress, the campaign feels a little more story-driven than the default map of Fallen Enchantress, but much more open-ended than that game's campaign.  I like the balance they struck with the quest system and dialogue options, giving the world flavor without hemming the player in.  I do kind of miss the linear story, being a fan of RPGs, but this works too.\n\nThe battle is more refined than Fallen Enchantress.  High-level warriors were essentially invincible in FE and could solo just about anything with life drain equipment (or was it Lords of Magic?).  In Sorcerer King even a high-level warrior with really strong defense can get overwhelmed by crowds of low-level enemies due to stacking flanking bonuses.  This of course works both ways.\n\nThe scenario encourages rapid exploration to grab crystal fragments, while punishing reckless settlement by drawing increasing attention from your foes, who will send increasingly powerful armies to squish you with each new city.  Building a ton of new settlements all at once early in the game will likely draw swift retaliation and a premature end, forcing the player to strike a balance between beating the doomsday timer and expanding before having the means to deal with the armies of your main foe.\n\nIn short, if you're a fan of 4X games, especially the fantasy genre, then you should pick this up.","November 4, 2015","true","71.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I played and enjoyed Fallen Enchantress, but unlike that game Sorcerer King kept me going until the end.  I really like the adventuring and army tweaking aspects, and this game had it in spades.  Town development was present but never felt annoying to me, and though I had hundreds of tactical combats I enjoyed each and every one of them.  There was plenty of variety in map locations and combats, and it was easy for me to both recruit and acclimate new units as well as carry tried and true "lowbie" starter units to the end through patient leveling, gear, and lots of enchanting.  Recommended in its current state for casual 4x fans... see other reviews for how it holds up to more challenging play.\n\nAs for bugs, as of the last patch in December 2015 I only encountered a handful, none of which stopped my fun and which I expect will be fixed as they put the final polishes and touchups on the game.","January 3","true","39.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I played with the "commander" and learned how to play as I went. Played a game and made some mistakes. Then I restarted. This time I played all the way through to the end. Total time was about 20 hours. Had to spend lots of time researching stuff on line, so I don't know if you can count all that fun time, but maybe that put my time at something like 28 hours (that counts\n\nThe map/world was beutiful. Battle graphics solid. The gameplay was sweet. I really enjoyed the rpg meets strategy mix. As I was looking for a fantasty 4X game (fix), very happy to say that it was a joy to play this one and hard to put down for my first play through.\n\nAs for replayability, I'm having a hard time starting up another game. Perhaps I'll play a random map with another faction one of these days, but right now, it just seems like work. The AI doesn't seem like it's much of challenge or allows a lot of different strategies either. I played on hard my first game (there's an insane difficulty I've yet to try). Perhaps once I start playing again it will get me hooked again, but I don't know, I've beat the sorcerer king. Now what? There are little steam rewards like beating game with each of the six different factions, but I can't be bothered with digital gold stars.\n\nSo, all in all, I'll give it an 8 out of 10. Yeah, hard critic I know, but what can I say, it was really fun to play through.\n\nMy message to the games makers is thank you. Keep making nice games like this. However, this game deserves to be boxed. It should have a 50 page paper instruction manual. It seems like it's missing something being sold via steam and having a bare bones digital manual. We should have detailed spell listings, item stats, monster listing, universe history, etc. The game deserves this 1999 Fallout/Baldurs Gate treatment, but I guess you probably couldn't afford it. Anyways, thanks again for a wonderful game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gormless/recommended/241990/","gormless","Indrid","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gormless/","132 products in account","A competant and fun 4X game that doesn't really excel at anything and lacks replayability.  Worth the new low price, especially on sale.\n\nThe game never quite feels at ease with what it's trying to do; there is a dissonance in almost every aspect.  The serious marketing ("How do you kill a God?") and gloomy premise (bad guy in charge) seems at odds with the almost cartoony visuals and humurous writing.\n\nThe economic and city-building aspect of the game is so basic and forgettable that you wonder why it's in the game.  It's like Stardock didn't want to fully commit to the nature of the title; building your own stack of doom.  The key of enjoying the game then becomes; how do you build the stack of doom?  Turns out, it's like most other 4X but stripped down.\n\nThe almost literal handful of units you can train from your cities is adequate at best, and boring at worst.  "Soldier", "Pikeman".  Really?  Even when you pick up a named unit with slightly different stats from one of the (well written) quests, they are usually just slightly different versions of these with the same model and animations.\n\nEach Sovereign (your character "class") has access to a unique starting Champion with their retinue, and one or two unique units.  These are the only things that have any character, and unfortunately your first Champion's retinue are not often good enough for end game, so you're left with the champions.  The Champions are cool, there's just nowhere near enough of them.  The ones that are there even share some aspects of their skill trees.  This is because the meat of the game, combat, is quite lacking.\n\nYou spend a lot of time fighting in Sorcerer King.  The battles are decent scale in terms of amount of units you can control, but they take place in tiny arenas.  There is no room for manoevre or really move at all.  You are right on top of each other.  This was obviously done to speed up the battles, but they went a bit too far.  You know what other 4X has a lot of focus on army building and combat? Age of Wonders 3, which has flanking, area of influence, range, sight blocking along with a massive selection of units.  It does this without the battles feeling any more of a chore than they do in Sorcerer King which lacks most of that nuance.\n\nSorcerer King makes some strange decisions with regards to balance.  Ranged units are able to target enemies wherever they are on the map.  This makes them immediate targets all the time since you can't hide from them, and makes for weird battles where the ranged back lines shoot at each other while the melee units try to reach them.  Another big dropped ball was the way the game handles initiative.  It's turn-based, and turn order is determined by initiative.  Fine.  The game then screws this up by giving you various ways, including a low level spell, to boost initiative.  Which then makes it the go-to thing to boost however you can, since you can often destroy an enemy army without them getting any turns.  This could have been solved by simply having initiative be a strictly inate statistic, or improved only very rarely.  Sorcerer King: The Search for Initiative.\n\nThe premise is cool, it gives you a singular focus; "I need to make an awesome stack for a boss fight at the end".  Unfortunately any adventure is drained from the experience as it plays out in typically the same way.  There are plenty of quests, but they mostly consist of reading some funny text and then fighting something, typically very easy even if they are labelled as "strong".  It's a fantasy world full of magic where not much interesting stuff happens.  If I'm building a stack, make that stack amazing.  Fill it with characters that you did awesome things with to get there.  But you didn't.  You read some text and fought some wolves, or you clicked a button and trained a cookie-cutter "Sentinel" (not as cool as it sounds)  from your emotionless city.  You can even recruit a Champion by simply selecting a skill on your skill tree.  Narratively justified?  Yes, perhaps, it could be regarded as a reflection of your fame.  But they could have tried to make it narratively interesting.\n\nSorcerer King is a game I wanted to love. A 4X that has me doing something other than running around and destroying enemy cities against poor AI.  They just didn't go all out with it, so you end up doing a lot of the same things anyway.  There is a crafting system, and it starts of cool but descends into tedium as you try to keep your stack not only equipped but those equipped items also enchanted (why can't I do them at the same time??) with an interface that just can't keep up.  Simple things let it down.  When you craft an item, you can have it instantly sent to a unit.  Cool right?  Does it give you a drop-down or grid or list to choose them from?  No, you get a singular field that you must click arrows to cycle through.\n\nI am still recommending this game.  It is an overall fun if short experience, with more time in the oven it could have been epic.  I'm not a fan of the visual style myself, but it's clean and there is enjoyment to be had with building your stack of death.  I paid £8-something and got over 15 hours, so that's good value in my book.  Are there better fantasy 4X games out there?  Yes, but this one is worth a play and could get significantly better if supported with DLC.","January 23","true","24.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Once I got the hang of the mechanics, I found myself playing for hours.  The game shares features from games like Civilization and Heroes of Might & Magic.  It's interesting to start in a game where the evil sorcerer has already won and taken over the land.  At the top of the screen, there's a doomsday meter that fills up every now and then and if you let it fill completely, you lose.  However, in the beginning the Sorcerer King doesn't find you a threat.  Not only does his forces ignore you unless you attack them first (in which case, the game will warn you that you're about to go to war with the Sorcerer King), but you have many opportunities to accept his help.  Sometimes he'll give you supplies, warriors, or magic in return for filling the doomsday bar a bit further.  You can also reduce the meter by completing quests honorably and using an expensive spell that also lowers the doomsday bar.  There's even a hero you can play as who feeds off of the doomsday meter, earning powerful spells and stats the closer to doomsday you are.\n\nThe dialogue is light hearted and funny.  Even some descriptions of units add a little bit of humor.  The pioneer unit, for example, explains that it is good at creating outposts, good at making settlements, and good at dying if no other units are around to protect it. The mana you gain can be used to cast spells during battle, give buffs to your cities, and even go as far as changing the landscape of the map.  In one such case, I used a spell to destroy a mountain instead of going completely around it.  On top of getting a shortcut to my destination, I also gained some crafting supplies from the rubble.\nWith unique features, such as the doomsday counter, along with  funny dialogue, many spells,  and 9 races/heroes to choose from, Sorcerer King kept me entertained for hours on end.   There wasn't anything with the game that I didn't like.  I just have a few small things I'd like changed/added to the game. I've been playing for 15 hours so far, and haven't come across any glitches.

On normal I found the game a bit easy, but I think this was a result of a major update that allowed the sovereign to cast without expending the unit's turn - this might get balanced back in later updates. My biggest gripe was that it gave me duplicates of the same hero in the campaign so I felt I didn't get to explore variations in game play that much, and because the game takes so long I will probably not play a larger size game again.","October 21, 2015","true","53.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

TL;DR The game is worth to buy. Definitely, way better than many other games. It plays like Civ on the tactical map with the battle system of Heroes of Might and Magic, systems tried and greatly enjoyable.\n\nWhat sets it apart is the interesting storyline, the *massive* campaign map(I have not delved on the skirmish maps yet and the tons of quests that can happen around it. Sadly the campaign with its masiveness starts you on the same place each time, but I know Skirmish Maps have randomized starting positions. Gameplay wise I cannot comment on too much without spoiling the surprise. I personally found the ability to summon units ridiculously powerful on the late game since I could explore the map with pioneers and each time they were attacked I could bring in an army of elementals in the battle map to win the fight. But I focused all my resources on being able to do that and it was very rewarding.\n\nAll in all the game encourages you to focus on one particular tactic and if you do that you can beat the hardest challenges. Again the campaign map is humongous and it took me ~20 hours to beat it on hard difficulty and I still had explored 60% of it.\n\nAs a negative side, I can say that the sound bugs up sometimes, and some improvements could be done on occasions where the AI takes your own units for a spin(such as on instant attack abilities or berserk-like abilities). There is an option for realistic combat animations where the units fights between tiles but on low res monitors this can make the units disappear.\n\nThere are cases where the animations and the otherwise smooth audio makes this a 3/5 in comparison to the best games out there, but I would give it a personal 4/5 because of the numerous neutral units you can recruit and the incredible variety this gives to your army. Almost every event allows you to recruit moppey bandits, failed barbers and bad shopkeepers and if you take care of them soon you have legendary heroes in your army. On my campaign the Sorcerer King fell to my army of heroes, including 2 Crazed Libraries and a Poor Yeti Philosopher that I had trained to perfection.\n\nIf you enjoy games like Civ and HMM you will definitely love this I can guarantee that.","December 27, 2015","true","15.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I had tried two previous times, choosing as I usually do to start learning games on a difficult setting to find out where the learning curve really is. I really enjoyed fallen enchantress and considered it the spiritual successor to master of magic from way back when.\n\nIn this latest 4x fantasy kingdom builder I found alot of giddy reminders of old play dynamics amid gaming concepts established in other gaming genres. Now rather than resources being narrowed down to a few basic commodities, much of the game is set around exploration and interaction with the environment.characters, crafting ingredients, and recipes are all hidden about the map and availbile as quest rewards, giving a new emphasis to getting out onto the map and securing as much 'low hanging fruit' as possible.\n\nThe pace of the game is controlled by the doomsday counter which I found to matter more when in a defensive posture then when out raiding on the map and being heroic. The mechanic of suffering penalties or earning rewards forcertain play styles made strategic use of certain spells a consideration.\n\nWhile there were a number of bugs I encountered with city production, the bigger hassle I experinced was in enduring the game's sense of humor. Most of the game establishes this feeling of impending doom and having to make long term strategic descions in order to advance, the humor seemed to me quite silly and over the top. Setting aside this glaring dichotmy, this is one of the best strategic game experinces I have had in a long long time.","March 17, 2015","true","105.1"," 16 of 33 people (48%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","48","16","33","0","0"

This is not a traditional 4X.  It's not supposed to play like a traditional 4X.  In some ways, I'd say this is more like a roguelike or RPG that uses 4X conventions.\n\nThe idea is to build your stack of doom/companions of doom, then take on the Big Bad (Sorcerer King).  It's a really neat concept, and the execution is getting there.   Now that it's out of beta, I can say that this as of right now, is my personal game of the year.\n\nThis game has a wide variety of challenges, and you can customize it to be a cakewalk, or make it really hard (setting Doomsday to fast really forces aggression and makes it much harder).   There's also a neat number of abilities- and the process of exploring, levelling, and fighting is fun.\n\nStardock has a lot of experience doing Early Access, having done it themselves before Steam was even created (the original GalCiv had EA)- so it's safe to assume they will deliver on the product.","November 22, 2014","true","162.0"," 13 of 27 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","13","27","0","0"

At launch, the game was unplayable.  So much so that the lead dev ended up giving everyone who purchased the game around launch the first 2 DLC's for free.  This was to ease the sheer amount of backlash the company received over the broken game.  After actually listening to the community and hiring some key devs, Fallen Enchantress came out (first DLC) and all was forgiven.  Then, Legendary Heroes came out and made the game even better.  However, now we have the Sorcerer King, an offshoot from the Elemental games... and Stardock apparently didn't learn their lessons with Elemental: War of Magic.\n\nSorcerer King is a broken mess.  Much of the game is riddled with bugs, some completely game-breaking.  There was a livestream that I watched where a guy sacrificed a thug to gain an extra spell cast.  However, despite the thug being off the map, the thug still had a turn and could be moved and sacrificed over and over again.  That was the start of the snowballing of bugs that riddled his game.  The thug was still alive on the tactical map.  However, whatever army he was in seemed to double itself.  The player moved his army to a spot to take out a Sorcerer King's attacking army.  However, on the next turn, he found that the army he moved had disappeared and the real army was in his city.  He lost that crystal.\n\nThen, there was the issue of complete brokeness of his conversion spell he attained through gaining enough Bravery.  He could have almost every mob that didn't have a high enough spell resist, to become his permanent unit.  He even successfully used it on drakes.  What made it even more broken was that the units that he converted didn't use up any of his Logistics like all the units that he trained would use.\n\nI have experienced game-breaking bugs such as trying to level up a city only to have the screen unexplicably move over to an army and I could not exit out.\n\nThis game, in its current form is a broken mess.  Unless things are fixed, I would not recommend anyone buy it at all.\n\nEDIT:  Here's the vid that I described above:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECqxEmIlWxM","August 4, 2015","false","2.7"," 11 of 23 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","11","23","0","5"

It will crash every 30 minutes or so, and just bug out where you cannot move or control particular units every few turns.","August 18, 2015","false","17.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","1"

And I really shouldn't use the term streamline because that might give you the impression of efficiency. Diluted, simple and colorless would better describe it.\n\nExamples of things I found most off-putting:\n\n-Can't be any faction other than the Kingdom of Altar\n-Heavily reduced unit customization\n-Game ending bug of reaching top sovereign level and finding no way to progress\n-Challenge curve went from normal to being an unstoppable steamroller finding 1 out of 20 fights worth being involved in directly\n-Limited building options\n-No more research choices, just a random set of spells to pick\n-Couldn't understand why some weapons I could equip on units, while others (most others) only for certain champions. (can't express how frustrating it was to have many armies fully equipped with armor/accessories and NO weapons)\n-general feeling that devs wanted to use the bare-minimum content from previous titles to get another title out ASAP for larger profit margins (admittedly I have no real evidence to support this)\n-got it on sale and still feel shorted\n-when interacting with the AI factions or questing, your character has the attitude of a quirky teenager the entire time. Imagine being a fearless death-magic casting tyrant who talks like a millenial half-witted hipster.\n\nFrankly I've nothing nice to say about it.\n\nAll in all, this may be the last nail in the coffin for the series for me.

It feels not like a beta, but a demo.  Demos should be free.\n\nRight now there is no semblance of balance between the player and the AI, on any difficulty setting.  Enemies scale in power sharply and for no reason, and no amount of crafting or leveling ever brings your units up to par fast enough.  If you have enough patience with Cheat Engine you can edit values during the game to achieve some level of parity and test out the combat mechanics, but if you don't do that it's very one-sided.\n\nThe basic accuracy of units is very, very low.  Therefore, most units miss constantly.  Allied units built at the base are garbage.\n\nThere is potential here, but this game is nowhere near complete.  If you liked War of Magic you might like this one, unfortunately this is NOT a beta but an alpha/demo at this point.\n\nThe gaming industry currently has a huge problem with companies making money off of unfinished products and it's encouraging a very low standard of game quality.  Paying full price for alpha-level demo's is one reason why they get away with it.","February 25, 2015","false","13.5"," 13 of 28 people (46%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","46","13","28","3","0"

It is a fun game with a mix of RPG, nice crafting system and strategy. However, it is relatively simplistic and once you have played it for a while, it gets pretty predictable. The single player campaign is only one map. Although it takes hours to do, because it is a relatively big map. I think it took me 15 hours to complete it first time, where I tried it on easy mode, because I was 100% new to the game. Easy mode is really easy. I have not tried it on higher difficulty yet. However, now that I know how the game works, I could probably do the campaign in around 10 hours. This is not a lot of content, when you, for example, compare it with 100 hours of campaign in Dragon Age 3 and Witcher 3, which is not much more expensive than Sorcerer King. The big weakness of this game is the overprice considering the limited content and relatively simplistic mechanics in the game, and bugs (which will be repaired with some updates I guess). The diplimomacy is also very simplistic and predictable, which does not add much fun to the gameplay. I have played the campaign, and in the last 10-15% of that campaign, I was getting bored and tired of the game. So, buy it on sale and try it out, if you want to, unless you want to pay overprice.","July 28, 2015","false","18.3"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

Would be helpful to know this applies only to units produced after the structure is built, and not to existing trained units.

The Sorcerer King has won, and is sitting back in his castle working on becoming a god.  I think of it like many 4X games on large maps - I am not going to spend the time to wipe out everything, I am going for an easier victory condition.  There is some lore that he needs sentient life to absorb when he casts the spell... so there is a reason he doesn't just waste you right away, his end game spell will do that for him.  At the start of the game, he wants you to peacefully build your single city.\nYou take a role as a conquered faction (now a minor faction) or one of the Sorcerer King's disgruntled  city managers and build power to stop him.  Do quests, make allies, build armies.\nTaking this like a regular 4X will draw the Sorcerer King's wrath. The start is a game of gathering loot and crafting supplies, doing easy quests and not drawing too much attention to yourself.  Leveling your Hero is practically more important than city building.  The beginning is an RPG with some minor empire stuff, and finish with your massive army meeting his.  There is a doomsday countrer - questing as a good guy can keep that very low.\nThere will be years of developer support and a lot of balancing. They already have a list of balances that will go out with the next update.\nI am impressed how it turned out. The first video intro to the game looked like animation from a free to play phone game ad. I was worried for the graphics and style of the game.","July 25, 2015","true","109.8"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

For $30 instead of $40, it's easier to look past it's rough edges.\n\nI really enjoy Sorcerer King.  I have just finished a very slow and terribly played by me campaign and I loved every minute of the 14 hours I took to fail.  Every time I played it,  I had to take just "one more turn" before going to bed.  It was stressful at times in a good way and I took a day off playing it at all because I just "didn't want to deal with it."  To me, it's great when a game can really make you think about it and in a way worry about it when you're not even playing.  I really felt like it was up to me to save the world.\n\nThat brings up a few things that I do not enjoy about Sorcerer King.  The main thing that could be improved upon is the AI for the Sorcerer King, himself, and the other factions you share the world with.  It really is up to you to save the world, because all the other factions are going to do if they side with you is trade with you and give you units.  They do have armies and I thing I saw them pick off a few smaller enemy groups, but they mostly let baddies march right through their kingdom to get to you.  I also had one faction side with the Sorcerer King.  They just sat around their only castle until I marched right up and destroyed it.  The AI needs to think about expanding, improving and being about to really go to war with you or against you.  As of now, it really doesn't do that.  I like getting units from my allies, but I would also like a real ally to back me up.  Your allies’ strength should be added to yours and be counted in the report tab.\n\nOver all, I really enjoyed playing Sorcerer King.  Focusing on questing and less on expansions is a nice break from the other turn-based strategy games I  enjoy.  I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys TBSs and want to imagine themselves as a fantasy hero charged with saving the world from a great evil that is growing ever stronger.  If the price is steep, it will be more than worth your time as it gets improved upon and goes on sale.\n","July 24, 2015","true","14.6"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I find harping on a game in early access for having bugs is kind of like saying Stalin was a little harsh on critics. There is just no point. However I will start by saying that yes there are bugs, however I have yet to encounter a game breaking one. Now onto the game.\nThis game is a 4X strategy game from stardock software. If you don’t like strategy games leave now. The game is set in a fantasy universe that uniquely has already been conquered by the evil overlord.  I found the more I played this game the more I enjoyed it. I would come across ruins and have to decide, do I slay the evil doers and move on, or do I hire them into my army growing my power but also moving the doom clock on. In my view this is how a moral choice should be with the “good” choice being the harder to execute but better for you in the long run. The combat is turn based and solid, there is a mechanic in it that I have not seen before in a turn based strategy game where if you have two or more units adjacent to an enemy whenever one of your units attacks all attack but only the selected attacker does full damage. It’s a neat idea and I look forward to seeing what they do with combat from here. Overall this game invokes a combination of galactic civilizations and heroes of might and magic 5. If that sounds up your alley pick it up or wait for release if you don’t like early access.\n","October 6, 2014","true","0.7"," 17 of 37 people (46%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","46","17","37","0","0"

The game is basically feature complete, but needs a little balancing and very, very few bug fixes. I've had two crashes the entire time I've played and only one annoying bug (Imperium quests). The game is also a lot deeper than it looks with a number of interesting decisions. Over on the Stardock forums, the creator is proposing some additional changes before release (July) which is going to make an already very good game better. In some ways this is a 4x Role playing game, with city expansion, limited resources, good and not drawn out tactical battles (not as in depth as Age of Wonders), and hundreds of small to large quests. The game comes with 6 different starting kingdoms/factions and the ability to customize you own. It also comes with a handful of pre-made maps and a random map generator which is good. I've only had one important place/item cut off from the rest of the map, forcing you to research a summon boat to go get.\n\nUnfortunately, there are not a lot of in-depth let's plays out there; and those that are don't show the mid to late game when the armies get larger and much more dangerous. Right now I'd give it an 8 on a scale of 10.","May 29, 2015","true","134.0"," 11 of 25 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","11","25","0","0"

It's a really good fanasy 4x game with RPG elements for your heroes and armies. Nonetheless, the game engine continues to stutter and pause unexpectedly on larger maps, even with a 64 bit operating system, 16 gigs of RAM, a GTX 970, and the fastest i5 processor currently on the market. But, the stutters and pauses aren't as bad as in previous games.\n\nGraphics are passable but not great. It's like a civilization game: you don't play it for the graphics. You play it for the gameplay.\n\nAnd the gameplay has a lot of interesting features, a few of which I've never seen in a 4x game before. The most notable feature is the doomsday counter. You see, the bad guy (the Sorceror King) has already won. You were one of his generals who is now in charge of a city. You learn he is planning a doomsday spell to end the world, so you decide to revolt. But, he doesn't know you're revolting yet. This makes things VERY interesting because:\n\n1) If you reveal that you're revolting from him before you're strong enough (by your diplomatic interactions with him, by attacking his forces, or by other interactions) then he'll send his forces against you and wipe you out, and\n\n2) If you don't defeat him by the time the Doomsday counter is full, then the world is destroyed and you lose.\n\nSo #1 forces you to be stealthy, in a way, and #2 forces you to be aggressive. But being too aggressive too early means you'll fail at #1 and he'll wipe you out. In other words, you have to walk a fine line and use REAL STRATEGIC THINKING when planning things out.\n\nAlso, you can accept help from the Sorceror King to bolster your forces (he believes you're still on his side after all, at least initially), but doing so advances the doomsday counter.\n\nGuys, I can't tell you how absolutely GENIUS and BRILLIANT this gameplay mechanic is! You have to walk a fine line or all is lost. This is the BEST innovation in 4x gaming since the original Civilization game came out, in my humble but expert opinion!\n\nYou can find great gear by completing quests or defeating powerful enemies, but often the best gear is made by crafting - after you get the blueprint and crafting components by, you guessed it: completing quests, defeating powerful enemies, and opening chests spread randomly over the map (which usually only contain crafting components, not actual treasure.)\n\nThere's also a ton of spells to research, that your sovereign casts, and combat is turn-based. So you get a fantasy Civ game with RPG elements, with a combat system a bit like the Heroes of Might & Magic or games of that ilk.\n\nSo, all in all it's a great game with a few new and interesting ideas that make gameplay interesting and unique enough to make this game stand out from the crowd. It's easily Stardock's best 4x fantasy strategy game yet.","July 10, 2015","true","68.4"," 9 of 21 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","9","21","0","0"

Along the way, there are other minor factions who may choose to ally with you, or (the rogues!) with the Sorcerer King.\n\nWhere the game shines is in the many interlinking systems that make up the customization and gameplay. There's the crafting system, which allows you to create armor, weapons, scrolls, potions etc. from found loot, and equip them to your units, giving a really good way to 'build up' your forces, and in a really organic way. There's the Shards system, which calls for strategic planning of where to place your cities and outposts in order to harvest all-important Shards which generate Magic, which is split into your Skill, Lore, or Mana (basically ruler abilities, research points, and currency.)\n\nSkill allows you to choose abilities in your Sovereign skill tree (ruler abilities), which vary according to your choice of Sovereign, and which grow alongside individual Champion trees for each of your Champions (hero units.) Lore (research points) can be used to choose one spell out of a randomized short list of available spells, which keeps each choice fresh and makes every choice important. Mana is your currency for casting these spells, and for other things like unit abilities and fast-buying city improvements.\n\nCities grow organically, according to their Food production, and as they level, you choose the next tile to expand into, depending on the Labor, Food, or Essence of that tile. Labor determines how fast your improvements and units build, while Essence determines how many City Enchantments you can cast on it.\n\nAll in all, the game is, even in this beta stage, a wonderful amalgamation and interlinking of all these systems. Every choice you make feels important, because it is important, because it affects some other thing that will affect some other thing in the game. At the end of the day, you're not simply making optimizations or doing management, but making some small degree of impact upon your final victory or defeat through each individual choice in all the different systems and mechanisms that come together to form the game.\n\nTactical combat (yes! tactical combat!) is square-grid based, and is snappy and to the point. Here too, choices matter, in tactical decisions such as movement, placement, ability usage, Sovereign spell casts, etc. Death for each unit feels final, as there aren't many ways to bring them back, and somehow you end up caring for each unit. Whether this be through their accumulated XP and levels, the equipment you put on them, or just because each unit plays an important part in every battle, or because a lot of them come with a cool backstory (like horse thieves that you forcefully reform into solders) or because you can name them silly names like Ben or Bill, it all really feels great, and you start to care for your men (though they're not always 'men.')\n\nExploration on the beautifully-drawn map is a joy. The landscape is lush and filled with treasure chests of resources for crafting, lairs of monsters for you to do heroic (or unheroic things) and gain XP and sweet loot, terrain of differing kinds, and outposts and cities of the other factions and the Sorcerer King. As you explore, you are faced with choices at each lair that gains you points in Compassion, Cowardice, Fame, Intimidation, and other personal qualities, that go on to have game effects according to each quality that you become strong in. The stories are entertaining, and multitudinous enough to not feel too repetitive, and each choice results in differing results with both combat and non-combat consequences.\n\nThe only thing the game is missing IMHO right now is more playable races, but this can be fixed in future expansions or DLCs if the developers will it. The devs are friendly too and responsive to forum posts, and run a weekly (or thereabout) dev stream on Twitch where you can chat to them directly.\n\nI'm not new to Stardock's style, and have played plenty of other 4X's in different genres (both sci-fi and fantasy), but Sorcerer King is a definite gem with lots and lots of potential. Support this awesome product to see it grow with more expansions!\n\nDefinite thumbs up, YES, YES, YES I recommend this game.\n\nEdit: Forum peoples are concerned about the Sorcerer King countdown, which is the countdown to the god-becoming spell that the Sorcerer King will cast. But there are actions and events in the game that slow the countdown or even set it back, so the countdown has elements of a push-and-pull between you and the Sorcerer King, and is not entirely an unstoppable timer. The countdown can also be set in the options to be slow.\n\nYou may or may not have a preference for the countdown, but it's not as bad as it sounds (this coming from someone who also had the same understandable knee-jerk reaction against a 'time limit'). But it adds a good amount of urgency to your actions without becoming unbearable, and is a great push towards achieving your goal in the game.","June 25, 2015","true","19.1"," 6 of 15 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","6","15","0","0"

No.  And this seems to be a lot of the problem that people posting negative reviews have.   SK is a different game set in the same universe.   If you play the game from that mindset, you will find a lot in SK to like.\n\nThere are enough similarities to the other Elemental games that you will get a nice, warm, notalgic glow from playing, but not so much that it feels like the same old game.\n\nThe game, while still strategic, moves at a much faster pace.  The Doomsday Counter is the bane of those who prefer to sit back and methodically build an empire.\n\nThe graphics style has changed.  Some will see this as an improvement, some won't.  Personally, I like the new style much better than the old.\n\nAlthough you can rename any unit in your army, designing your own units is gone.\n\nBasically, you unlock unit types which you can then build if you have the necessary resources. Apart from hero units ( of which there are much fewer ) , Individual units do level up and can be customized to certain extent, but not to the extent of the other Elemental games.\n\nThe best way to describe Sorcerer King is that it is a much more focused game than its Elemental brethren.  The point of the game is to stop the Sorcerer King - not to build a huge sprawling empire.  If you spread your empire too far and too fast, the Sorcerer King's minions show up on your doorstep to crush you.   Of course, if you spread too slow, they eventually show up and crush you anyway too.\n\nSo, should you buy Sorcerer King?\n\nIf you are looking for an expansion of the previous Elemental games, I would say no.\n\nBut if you are looking for a fun game in the Elemental universe, I would say, definitely.\n\nAs game balancing improves, the game can only get better and better.\n\nI say to you, "Go forth and stop the apocalypse !

The game offers many ways to become more powerful: leveling units, crafting/enchanting items, spells (city enchants, unit enchants, summons, land changing, etc.), sovereign skill trees, hero skill trees, and city buildings.\n\nIt is still a little buggy, but Stardock seems to be working hard to eliminate bugs, balance the game, and include further enhancements before the close release date.\n\nIt does seem like heroes are currently much more powerful than standard units.

I reopened a game after many month and updates to find out if anything has changed with this game. Suprisingly I am thinking more favorable about it now. There have been many tweaks to the game that have made this a more enjoyable experience. Although it still is not the sequal that I had hoped for I do find itt now a worth while game to sit down to. Hope it continues.\n\n1st Impression 35hrs\nFirst off I understand Sorcerer King (SK)  is now out of Beta and into Early Access with improvements possibly still to come. Somehow at this stage I doubt there is a lot that would be changed.\n\nSecond I played Elemental a bit and thought the concept amazing, a civ type game in a fantasy world setting. Loved it. Though there were many bugs and some bad excecution,  I was excited to see the coming of Fallen Enchantress (FE). Great improvement from one game to the next though still some noticeable bugs  and some concepts not fully materialized to make it the next great game for me.\n\nPresent. A game concept with the idea to continue from game end of the last, you the loser, the same world elements and same unique artwork.  After playing this game roughly 30 hours on a couple play throughs I find it having a lot of potential but lacking. To me, and just my opinion, this game lacks on a great many levels and some serious backwards steps to a concept I hoped would get better.\n\nPros:\n* Overall look: Art work is much better than previous games. Characters have more definition and diversity in appearance. Animations and actions are pretty cool. Beautiful work here.\n* Game flow: Turns move much quicker and the game moves on at a nice pace.\n* The enemy js continually sending out attackers/ armies, that actually give a decent amount of XP instead of (1) per unit. (This was the case in FE a concept that drove me nuts when the monster lairs ran dry).\n* A crafting system to add / remove items as needed to all units. Not sure if I like this yet vs pooling resources for unit production. Atm will list as pro.\n* Sovereigns: I like the overlooking ruler with a skill tree of their own to aid the minor faction as it grows to a kingdom able stand agaist the SK..\n* Magic: Having limited spells in combat is a nice touch. Pick what you need to win or aid you vs unlimited access in FE\n* Champions: Again less is better. One or two to make it count is better. Take your champion were its needed instead of one for every army. Only grip is how quickly the skill tree maxes out. Some skills seem kind of lame, some  are supper cool really only giving me the desire to use on or two since the others are clearly less effective.\n* Logistics: Great concept. Army count based off support of city and buildings built. Just takes the burden out of the players hands to micro manage finances. Now just field your armies and enjoy the game with the logistical count available.\n\nWhatevers:\n* Single city tiles (SK) vs build on towns (FE). Personally I liked the build on town in (FE). This was a very unique design that mad it feel as if my towns were growing in size and scope. I also like the simple version of the single tile system. It is very clean and still changes as it grows taking much less space so max level cities are not hording the map realestate, limiting room to march armies or having the AI go for one more town that won't grow right next to you.\n* Army size: (FE) had what I thought to be pretty cool units size. Individual, squad, company, etc. Ths idea was completly thtown out in (SK). I personally like the growing army size in (FE) but seeing as units start with 1x3 size its sort of a wash aside from the odd 1x1 units you start with or aquire through the course of gameplay.\nResources: Logistical build vs stockpiling resource. Both seem to have useable functions to the game and add their own flair. Set amount to use (SK) vs limited to abundance through gameplay (FE)\n\nCons:\n* Although the overall look and feel has been enhanced, the overall game just seems to be lacking some functional depth. The concept of the game is epic. An all powerful sorcerer king has begun his actions to end the world as we know it and yet it just doesn't feel translated into the game as it progresses.\n* Battles: For me they lasted roughly half a turn, maybe one with me. I usually never feared the death to my mundane groupe of soldiers. There is never a real sense of a armies clashing taking place. Since battle is fairly weak there is no real need for strategy in the much more defined battlemap and its choke points, no need for diverse units and no need for the plethera of now worthless spells to cast or special moves. Why cant some depth be given to city/ castel fights. Walls, ramparts, towers? Something to make it feel more grand. No this is not Total War but, it is still a castle.\n* Magic: Lots of spells, most seem useless or a repeat in a different form. Without a variety of foes, weaknesses and strengths, there is not much need for a variety of spells.\nTactical: Since battles end so quickly why the need for lots of options? You wont get to use any. Though (FE) battles lasted a little longer the same problem persists. There isn't much stategic value using them when other skills can be employeed over and over at the same result or faster. Casting the spell just takes a move away from my unit to give a crap bonus for or against when I can just walk up and hack it.\nStrategic: Lots of them that just seem unbalanced, wasted time, or a rarely seen or valued opportunity to cast aside from city enchantments. Limited terraforming spells in this rendition seem pretty usless or bugged at the moment.\n* Crafted Items: Great idea, aweful excection. I can make cool items to give my hard working soldiers and champs!? Here guys try this piece of crap I made for you that really doesn't change a thing! Who cares about a ring that give a mighty +1 hp. Are you kidding me? Outside the armors, most craftable items are a waste of time and resources that wont effect much unless enchanted which really only has about 7 options at this time. The rest of your options come from loot infused as enchantment which takes up far too much space instead of being stacked for a quick easy look at what you have relative to what it does. We dont need 4 items scattered across 3 pages to know we have a lot of clouded rubies. Important resources for the nice gear are just too infrequent to make me care about the process. Waapons should progress allowing a nice order and time frame from low to high instead of being able to make two (worst and best) skipping all in between by the time I get said resources.\n* Cities: Appear to have been turned into very basic linear choice without much variety. Since your choices of where to build have relatively taken away there aren't bonus structuers, such as being next to a river like a dock (FE). Could we also try the previously mention here too? Units should stack as army inside the city for one option, not each. Not a nig deal but its just the missed attention to detail that nags at me and being tired of looking at my army of administrators..\n*Outposts seem more for decoration and tower defense than an integral part of the game outside of grabing a resource. I loved them in (FE) for atk/def/ move bonuses and population boosting. Felt more like expanding my kingdom instead of putting up a sign.\n* Though AI turns move faster the overall game seems to as well, as if some of the meat has been taken out to give you a very fast unengagging flat experiance. The graphics and art may have improved along with a few new or improved concepts but sadly thats about where it ends.\n\nIn closing I will say I just expected and hoped for more. At this time if it stays as it is and at the current cost, so should you. Wait for a special. If you want something quick and easy with little fulfilment or attachment, this is for you.","February 12, 2015","true","157.7"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

Now the developers seem to be adding some of the bells and whistles that make it worth the purchase. It's almost at the level of its forbarer, fallen enchantress, but different -- in a good way. I've never been much into story lines but the idea of protecting the shards is superbly developed into the gameplay, and crafting/enchanting items is also a nice new touch. The developers are definitely on to something, and I'm glad they haven't gone the way of "Sid Meier" and totally destroyed what was a good game with later iterations. Keeping adding unique touches like "unique once per game" city improvements, or other surprises, and you may have a winner!","May 7, 2015","true","135.7"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

Even the main menu when it returned me to it has no more music.\n\nSometimes units will freeze during a battle, making where they will not be able to do anything else (Including pass) forcing you to simply auto end the battle, hoping the simulator is smart enough to win you the battle, or at least not kill off half of your army in the process.\n\nAll the AI nations have 0 interaction with each other. When you ally with a nation to have them join your cause to battle the sorcerer king, it would make sense for them to fight the forces they come across. Instead, they simply walk on by as if they are simply another map obstacle. This also makes no sense because it makes it harder for them to expand their cities for no reason at all, I have yet to feel a difference on their city expansions between normal and insane difficulties for the AI's.\n\nAs many bugs as there are, I have high hopes for this game, and will continue to be pllaying this game for a while longer.","August 25, 2015","true","34.2"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

This isn't quite the world's first successful strategy-RPG -- the first game which is both uncompromisingly a strategy game and uncompromisingly a Japanese-style RPG -- but it shows what that game would look like; among the secrets are sharply circumscribing the range of available possibilities, and creating a scenario which can play out in broad strokes that the game can recognize, even when the details are wildly different from game to game.\n\n_Sorceror King_ is also a worthy successor to _Master of Magic_, probably the first game that can really call itself _Master of Magic 2_. It even includes the part where High Men Paladins are a strategy in themselves :) -- and more seriously, it has the exact same feel, but more modern, more fully implemented and fleshed-out. Your character is more sympathetic, too, unless you go out of your way to choose the evil vassal.\n\nAs a game itself, it's superb -- although also horribly addictive in the classic just-one-more-turn manner of spacefaring 4Xes. I can recommend this too strongly, if there's anything else you want to do with your life; but still, it's really, really good.\n\nAtmospherically, the game is odd. The Sorceror King is plotting to destroy all life and absorb the whole world into himself; he's a savage brute, a torturer and slave-driver; but he's just so _gullible_. And _helpful_. If he went to Atlantic City he'd get scammed in shell games. Even though he's an absolute moral monster, I almost feel _guilty_ about stabbing him in the back.\n\n(By the way, there's a spell which the Sorceror-King is unimaginably weak against. Make modest use of it, and you can cheese the game; you can win well before what was supposed to be the halfway point. The miracle spell in question? Raise Terrain.\n\n(Create Road is pretty game-busting, too.)","July 28, 2015","true","16.0"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

Played it for few hours and I must say that this game has soooo much potential to be great.\nMy biggest wishes are in chaotic order:\n- Increased randomness of loot and quests i.e. more interesting loot, more quests with varied rewards so I could b e turned into more roguelike instead of gimped 4x (it isnt 4x and never will be). I would be fantastic to have different "runs" and be surprised with new loot that changes the way the particular run plays.\n- I would like my actions to have impact on environment - now when I cast "devestating" spells nothing really happens to trees, grass etc. That would be so awesome to see scorched earth, broken trees etc. you get the picture.\n- Tactical battles are boring right now - add new animations, speed things up, make bodies stay on battleground, make more special effects (like ragdoll etc.) so that battles are engaging, fun and great to watch. After several manual battles I could not be bothered to play them and relied on auto resovle.\n- I think that spells should be made easier to cast, have more spells and be able to cast more of them (even if you have to nerf some of them). They are fun, yet to are so limited with options and mana gains every turn.\n- have more units - current ones are so boring - archers, militia... REALLY??? BO RING!!! Come on guys every sentinel should have their own and different units at their disposal.\n- why cant we have the bad guys fighting with the sorcerer king? I mean I would like to build some necromancer who is even more bad ♥♥♥ the SK himself and go for his throat.\n- strategic map - make things stay on the map when you loot or kill things. Why do they disappear? After 50+ turns the stratgic map is co boring to look at. Instead we should have battle spot visible on the map like bodies, burnt down camps, pillaged libraries etc. THat would add some flavour. I dont think it is that difficult to implement.\n- my castle should change the way it looks the more stuff i build, have more skins for castles. Now I have say 5 towns they all look the same. Again that is Boring!\n-Strategic map is dead i mean apart from me and very rare mobs raoming around nothing is happening at all. Minor factions are stuck at their towns waiting for you to complete their quests. Mobs very rarely move out of their lairs.... Boredom across the board. You can leave your towns undefended and nothing will happen. Even SK himself rarely comes to check what you ar up to.\n- Outposts - make them more useful. Right now you can have either offensive or defensive spcialisation and that is it. Again that is boring.\n\nI spent several hours with the game and had some fun with it. However if it doesnt tackle boring aspects of the game it will fade away into mediocre game which i would not like to happen.\n\nWill update my feedback the more i play.\n\n","December 27, 2014","true","13.6"," 6 of 16 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","6","16","0","0"

It is a poor idea for any 4H game, however in its current iteration in this game, you are not just rushed, you are basically going to lose regardless.\n\nPlaying it on normal, in some scnarios you can go on for quite a while. However if the enemy decides to start destroying shards, which are all over the map. You have no way of stopping it. Especially when they start early on. You simply cannot get there, the maps are pretty big. Even the medium sized ones. There seems to be something in the order of 50 shards on the map with the FEW shards option checked in map creation. The enemy "Sorcerer King" starts with units in virtually every inch of the map. And these are the guys who kill off the shards.\n\nIt boggles my mind how something like this even made it past the planning phase, much less got in the game. The community (forums) for Stardock are exclusively fan boy driven. I think this game is a case where it was developed in a vacume and the devs and the fanbois colluded together and simply drank their own coolaid. The end result is a very poor game with a broken mechanic (timer) that should never be in a game like this. If you like to take your time, develop your lands, characters, and armies....this game is not for you. In many cases  even at break neck speed the timer will finish with you losing no matter what.\n\nOther comments: This is an in house game engine that they have been using for  a few years. It still has a decent sized memory leak that has never been fixed to date. However you can play for about a few hours before it starts act up and crash. The graphics have not been updated and it seems like they made the detailed play map dissappear at any distance away to try and improve performance. The result is in order to see anything other than a cloth map you have to be zoomed in till it feels like your face is next to the ground. I did not like this, and I do not remember any of the previous games doing this.\n\nThe game balance is still wonky, It's in beta (but nearly complete) but that is to expected when the last touches are going into the game. They have made the unit creation pretty boring, you can create a basic soldier, pikeman, archer, armor warrior,  rider, paladin. And that's it. You customize them with gear, but then....who has time for that thanks to the timer? There are less heroes, you might be lucky to get 3 maybe 4.\n\nLack of AI: this series continues to have bad AI. This game in particlar is the worst I have seen in awhile. Civilization 1 has better AI than this game. The factions...if you can call them that, do nothing. They don't attack you, they don't build armies and fight each other or the Sorcerer King. They sit there, they don't found towns. And this is just the strategic AI. The tactical combat is no better really. The AI does seem to pick your weakest members, but almost any mechanic that might have made combat interesting has been removed, ostensbily because the poor AI can't handle it.\n\nThat means ranged characters have no range....that is they can hit you anywhere on the map, through trees, over walls. It doesn't matter. God forbid the AI have to position themselves for a shot. The fact is the AI is basic so mechanics like these are not possible. (See Jagged Alliance, now 10+ years old for a game that was able to do this.). The castle sieges are the same old tripe as in previous games in the series. With some basic obstacles being put in place (barricades) which can be used as cholepoints, which does at times make it feel like there is some stragey.\n","June 20, 2015","false","278.7"," 8 of 23 people (35%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","35","8","23","2","1"

Combat is pretty decent but there is a great glaring problem, the replayability. There is 6 characters to play as and 6 different starting champions each character is slightly different but not different enough! With no multiplayer having only one faction to play as makes it a bit meh to replay as you gain no real incentive to play more than a few games when there is no real variety. There are many factions in the game you just can't play as them.\n\nBut the game is supported and they do patch it often enough with new stuff so for the price it's great if this is the kind of game you are into.\n\nShort notice: I encounterd a few bugs related to the rush ability. With the commander character you can make it so that all units have rush and this ability only functioned like 30% of the time and characters that had rush on basic got the problem that they now had 2 rush abilitys one that worked and somethimes worked and I had no idea which one was which.","January 2","true","20.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You really need to pick the top tree skill development to allow you to have more men per army or you are dead - took me 3 games to realize , this is just not a style of fighting, it will be required later.  2. Use your outpost and then quickly rank up with another pioneer in the outpost to improve defense.   Use these to block all enemies from approach to your cities by putting on restricted pinch points outside your cite.  3.  Save before every large battle, etc.   So now that I have learned on my own through trial and error, I would give it a 7/10.   There is still some bugs with the AI, I played 2 games back to back to test out heroes and in one game it seemed balanced, the other game, doing same things I found huge armies spawning on my doorstep ending the game quickly for me.  No idea what the issue is there (bad logic seed?).  Also for people who want a more difficult game, use the create game option from main, choose tiny map and do not use any outpost and only play with 5 people on your team.  The AI in the game I played seemed to use all the bandits from larger map and put on tiny map and the SK lieutenant both faced me quickly in the game before I was even 1/10 through game (another AI issue no doubt).  I think the game has potential  to be a 9/10 if they fix some things and maybe bump up the graphics and tactical battles.  So many battles look identical - the enemy puts the units in exact same place and you start same place so once you know the pattern - boring (need to have a little more random placement so not a slam dunk).  So looking forward to the AI fixes and next update.  So as of now, would I buy the game , no, but with improvements , yes.  There are too many glitches in the AI where some things just are not logical (one time I killed a stack, moved away – out of sight, moved back and it was all refreshed with new one – so obviously the AI wants a stack right there for some reason – so unless you want to fight endless enemies ignore it – was army w/horses).","January 1","false","59.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The quest text is actually worth reading as it is a) brief and b) usually interesting/humorous. I've had a couple laugh-out-loud moments, and that doesn't happen often in a game that isn't Portal. Some people have called the writing style "snarky", but I hate that word and those people. Pick a better word. I'd suggest "funny" or "sarcastic".\n\n- The devs have REALLY reduced the amount of micro-management, at every level, that you have to engage in over the course of a campaign. There is city building, but it is not as involved as a game like Civilization. I actually find this to be a pro because of the focus on running my hero around as opposed to checking 5 cities every turn. It is, however, more robust than I remember the old HoMM's being. Expect to have your cities queue up a new project every 2-20 turns, and take care of themselves largely in between.\n\n- Much like the limited city-building, there is very little management at the empire level. You have a shared pool of resources that you split between your tech tree research, spell research, and mana pool. The tech and spell trees are small compared to a game like Civilization. However, each choice has a pretty big impact and all the spells I've come across are regularly useful instead of being filler or only applicable in rare situations. Mana powers your spells on the map and in combat, and also serves as currency to rush build things a la money in most other games.\n\n- So if you aren't managing 50 different details of your city and empire, what do you spend your time doing? The majority of your time in Sorcerer King is spent running your army or armies around the map and getting involved in HoMM/King's Bounty-style turn-based tactical combat.\n\n- I'll start with the overworld map play. You run around a vividly-colored world that is surprisingly charming for a realm that has been devestated by the eponymous wicked Sorcerer King. The landscape is brightly colored and has a fair bit of cartoonish detail. Think more World of Warcraft than Gears of War. There are a ton of treasure and quest sites scattered around, which, when coupled with some fast-travel spells, really reduce the number of "dead turns" in which nothing happens.\n\n- I play on Hard difficulty, and I've found the tactical combat to be varied and satisfying. I'm a veteran player of these sorts of games (HoMM, King's Bounty, XCOM, etc) and I find in most fights I can micro-manage my way to a victory without losses. It takes some brain power though, and in some fights I've had to either accept losses or reload and change tactics. This game is usually fair but is also unafraid to hand you a challenge that makes you pay attention. There is a good amount of variety in skill types between the hero and non-hero units, which helps keeps the fights interesting. You won't spend much time just auto-attacking your way through a fight as quickly as possible, at least not if you want to come out of it unscathed. You can auto-resolve combat if you wish, although I'd only recommend it against opponents much weaker than yourself.\n\n- As with the tech and spell trees, the hero ability trees have been pruned down so that most if not all choices are a big step up in power.\n\n- The last thing I'll mention is that there is not much depth in kingdom vs. kingdom play, and that has discouraged some customers. Your grand opponent every time is the Sorcerer King, and his doom-timer sets a turn limit every game, although some spells, techs and quest resolutions will let you gain more time. There are other factions, but they function more like minor cities/factions in other 4X games as opposed to fully-featured opponents. You will engage in diplomacy/name calling with the other factions, and the Sorcerer King checks in on you frequently and will even give you support (at a price) at the start of the game until you ♥♥♥♥ him off. Expect a few chuckles and some quests/heroes/artifacts from the other factions. Do not expect epic, drawn out, multi-front battles across lots of territory.\n\n- I have not checked to see how others are doing, but I personally have not run into any bugs at all while playing this game.\n\nConclusion:\n\nI have enjoyed my time with Sorcerer King so far, and I look forward to continuing play and trying out new sovereigns and heroes. On the surface the game may seem surprisingly casual for a Stardock title, but there is a lot of depth and fun to be had in this title. Frequent small rewards, interesting combat, great writing, colorful art, and a reduction in tedium all make this game worth checking out for fans of the genre. I give it a solid 8/10 and will recommend it to my friends.","October 2, 2015","true","42.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a great twist on the typical fantasy 4x, build an empire game.\n\nI love the fact that it encourages you to create a "stack of doom".  I like to try and preserve my fav character/units and watch them level up.  When I lose a character unit that I gained from a quest, I actually care.  You start with a couple of characters and you either train more (through your cities), or find more from adventuring and doing quests.  I find it an enjoyable break from building huge empire.  About half way through the enemy starts becoming more than a nuisance and you have to try and both defend your cities and keep your primary punch party moving toward it's goal.  I like trying to balance assets during this time.  Sometimes you can use the terrain (and even modify it) to create choke points.\n\nThings I'd like to see improved include more quests (because I know them all after playing a lot), and a more challenging end game, and some mod tools.  Like many games before a DLC/major update it, I can envision an even better game in the future and if it was $49 I might say wait.  But you'll get a lot of fun for $25 as is.","March 3","true","238.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The quest text is actually worth reading as it is a) brief and b) usually interesting/humorous. I've had a couple laugh-out-loud moments, and that doesn't happen often in a game that isn't Portal. Some people have called the writing style "snarky", but I hate that word and those people. Pick a better word. I'd suggest "funny" or "sarcastic".\n\n- The devs have REALLY reduced the amount of micro-management, at every level, that you have to engage in over the course of a campaign. There is city building, but it is not as involved as a game like Civilization. I actually find this to be a pro because of the focus on running my hero around as opposed to checking 5 cities every turn. It is, however, more robust than I remember the old HoMM's being. Expect to have your cities queue up a new project every 2-20 turns, and take care of themselves largely in between.\n\n- Much like the limited city-building, there is very little management at the empire level. You have a shared pool of resources that you split between your tech tree research, spell research, and mana pool. The tech and spell trees are small compared to a game like Civilization. However, each choice has a pretty big impact and all the spells I've come across are regularly useful instead of being filler or only applicable in rare situations. Mana powers your spells on the map and in combat, and also serves as currency to rush build things a la money in most other games.\n\n- So if you aren't managing 50 different details of your city and empire, what do you spend your time doing? The majority of your time in Sorcerer King is spent running your army or armies around the map and getting involved in HoMM/King's Bounty-style turn-based tactical combat.\n\n- I'll start with the overworld map play. You run around a vividly-colored world that is surprisingly charming for a realm that has been devestated by the eponymous wicked Sorcerer King. The landscape is brightly colored and has a fair bit of cartoonish detail. Think more World of Warcraft than Gears of War. There are a ton of treasure and quest sites scattered around, which, when coupled with some fast-travel spells, really reduce the number of "dead turns" in which nothing happens.\n\n- I play on Hard difficulty, and I've found the tactical combat to be varied and satisfying. I'm a veteran player of these sorts of games (HoMM, King's Bounty, XCOM, etc) and I find in most fights I can micro-manage my way to a victory without losses. It takes some brain power though, and in some fights I've had to either accept losses or reload and change tactics. This game is usually fair but is also unafraid to hand you a challenge that makes you pay attention. There is a good amount of variety in skill types between the hero and non-hero units, which helps keeps the fights interesting. You won't spend much time just auto-attacking your way through a fight as quickly as possible, at least not if you want to come out of it unscathed. You can auto-resolve combat if you wish, although I'd only recommend it against opponents much weaker than yourself.\n\n- As with the tech and spell trees, the hero ability trees have been pruned down so that most if not all choices are a big step up in power.\n\n- The last thing I'll mention is that there is not much depth in kingdom vs. kingdom play, and that has discouraged some customers. Your grand opponent every time is the Sorcerer King, and his doom-timer sets a turn limit every game, although some spells, techs and quest resolutions will let you gain more time. There are other factions, but they function more like minor cities/factions in other 4X games as opposed to fully-featured opponents. You will engage in diplomacy/name calling with the other factions, and the Sorcerer King checks in on you frequently and will even give you support (at a price) at the start of the game until you ♥♥♥♥ him off. Expect a few chuckles and some quests/heroes/artifacts from the other factions. Do not expect epic, drawn out, multi-front battles across lots of territory.\n\n- I have not checked to see how others are doing, but I personally have not run into any bugs at all while playing this game.\n\nConclusion:\n\nI have enjoyed my time with Sorcerer King so far, and I look forward to continuing play and trying out new sovereigns and heroes.

However, it lacks a considerable amount of depth compared to other 4x games and as an RPG is also fairly shallow which greatly hurts the game's replayability. One play though and you've probably seen and done enough that playing thorugh again just isn't very compelling. I'd suggest players who have never played Legendary Heroes give that a go first - it offers much deeper and satisfying gameplay over the long term.","January 31","false","25.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Great concept, just the follow through lacked.  For instance when you're attacked in the tactical screen it doesn't scroll with the attack, so sometimes you don't know if your hit and what happened.  Or glitches in trying to win the game, i had to reload three times and go to the gates of the Sorcerer King with a specific number of people and hero to get the end game to open up.  Other issues, are that some heroes have no weapons that they can equip, seems to be something simple to solve if the time was put in.\n\nI didn't mind the minor glitches until i got further along and then they just got annoying.","December 30, 2015","false","48.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

After saving and quitting the game, it did  have a message saying that it was out of memory). I hope they fix that, but at least you have the warning signs that memory is running low, so you can save and restart.\n\nI recommend the game.","January 23","true","9.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While it is fun it does get a little repetitive for my tastes. Also the Campaign is just not very hard and static. I also found that with Hypnosis it almost becomes too easy almost exploitatively so, especially when you add +magic items to ensure that boss level creatures don't resist you. The non campaign game was more challenging, playing on the highest difficulty it was too hard, as the SK seemed to just blow up the mana nodes every turn.\n\nOverall it was a fun game for a short while but I wouldn't recommend it until it gets around the $20 pricetag.","May 8","false","75.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A few things players say are not as good, but overall and on balance it is a step up.\n\nYou will definately get your money's worth enjoying at least one, or two restarts to learn it followed by at least one and possibly two full play throughs, but replayability after that will likely be an issue. It is immersive and addictive. My opinion is based on my having played the game and also on having read many comments from others on these issues.\n\nIt is a completely different animal than Age of Wonders.

It has great mods and a lot more replayability.\n\nThis game is in the middle ground for me.  It feels like a great mod or expansion to FE:LH, but not a game in itself.  You play as the same one race in all games and your heroes are identical.  You can choose a different starter hero, but thats not a big game changer.  Your soverign choices are OK, but there isn't a lot of customization.   This really feels like it wasn't meant to be a whole game, but a large expanison.  I wouldn't buy it for more than $10.

The differences between each hero and sovereign make different playthroughs intriguing.  However, there are downfalls to the game.  Rings granting experience boost become essential for characters gained both early and late game.  Also, there are a few skills that do not work well.  For instance, Quickdraw is an ability that Archer heroes learn that makes archers attack first and automatically.  Once I had three archers on my team, only two were firing automatically and this actually cost them their next turn somehow.  The final skill to watch out for is the sovereign skill belonging to the general sovereign.  It says that it will allow all of your troops to attack first, but what it doesn;t say is that the leader of the army (the army receives its name from the leader) uses this sovereign skill costing your leader their turn.  Along with that issue, is that moves like Rush and Scurry do not work during this first attack phase.  Don't get me wrong, I am probably going to get all of the achievements and am enjoying what I experience, I just feel the need to warn future players.  I also believe I could refind this game months or years from now and still enjoy playing it.","June 4","true","56.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
