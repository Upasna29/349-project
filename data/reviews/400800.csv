"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fathaggard/recommended/400800/","fathaggard","FatHaggard","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fathaggard/","212 products in account","Review as of April 9th 2016 (8.7 Hours Played)\nI'll update this review as the game changes.\n\n\nSummary:\nMXGP2 is better than its predecessor in a lot of ways but ultimately feels less realistic than the first game did.You begin the game on a stock 250cc bike (MX2) that can't clear anything and on realistic difficulty every NPC is faster than you. After upgrading some parts its a little better but it's not until you get on the 450cc (MXGP) that the game is fun. Even then, if you came to race AI NPCs you're going to be dissapointed. There is no bar banging like in the first MXGP. The NPCs don't make any attempts to pass or avoid you, they're very clearly on rails and don't fall down often. The pack never splits up like in real motocross or in the first MXGP, its just a horrifying train of bikes that take basically the same line for the entire moto. What's worse is that when they inevitably barrel into you from behind you WILL fall, and they probably won't. Still, when you aren't racing with unstoppable machines piledriving your swingarm into the dirt, the riding is a blast! Suspension feels nice and bouncy and cornering, although not as satisfying as the first game is a fun technique to learn. Furthermore, THE BERMS WORK NOW! You can absolutely RAIL some corners on the outside line, and what is motocross about if not railing corners? The suspension tuning and gear ratios do make a noticeable difference and I personally find it really fun to tweak with different setups while running practice laps.\n\nAnyway, this is getting too long so I'll get to the point. MXGP2 isn't great and it probably isn't going to get better but it is a realistic and fun experience in genre where only one new game hits the market every 2-3 years. If you're not interested in multiplayer, check out the original MXGP. If you're not interested in realism and just want to freeride dirt bikes with friends, go get MXvxATV Reflex. If you want to play a realistic motocross game with friends, I recommend this one.\n\n\nDeveloper Reputation:\nMilestone has made decent games in the past like Ride and the MotoGP series, unfortunately MXGP and MXGP2 don't live up to the same level of quality as their other titles. The first mXGP was released with a lot of bugs and support was ultimately dropped leaving the multiplayer unplayable and the game performance very low quality. I recommend that you take Milestone's poor history into account while reading this review. Hopefully I'm wrong, but it's unlikely that we will see any bugs being fixed let alone any requested features added to the game. The only DLC planned are additional rider gear and TWO more tracks, nothing to get excited over.\n\nPros:\nClutch & Manual Transmission\nGood first person view\nGreat career mode\nIndoor stadiums!\nPlenty of customization\nSuspension setup presets can be saved\nIncredible replay feature (you can't save replays)\nCons:\n\nEngine sounds bad\n250cc isn't very fun\nAI aren't intelligent\nColliding with AI means losing 10+ positions\nOdd player animations\nAir control take a lot of getting used to\nOnly 4 indoor tracks...\nCurrent Bugs:\n\nSwitching to Wheel settings freezes game in menu\nChanging the keybind for the clutch freezes game in menu\nCustomizing rider or bike while in online lobby disconnects you from the match\nAudio goes completely quiet while taking sharp turns\nVerdict: Apprehensively Recommended\n\nThe first impressions of MXGP2 will leave you wanting a refund but after toying with bike tuning, upgrading to a 450cc and rebinding your controls, you'll learn to love it.\nThe game is more polished than the first MXGP but feels less gritty and more arcadey.\nIf you're looking for realism this game blows the MX vs ATV series out of the water standing as the ONLY decent offroad motorcycle game with manual transmission and clutch controls.\n\nThis game wins most improved in a genre with very few competitors.\nThe first MXGP is better and more fun in a lot of ways but this game feels more finished.\nIf you're a fan of realistic motocross games and want to play alone, I recommend the first MXGP.\nIf you want to play a fun motocross game with friends, get MX Vs ATV Reflex.\nIf you want a realistic motocross game to play with friends, this is your best (and only) bet.\n\nP.S. Milestone please add more Stadium courses!","April 9","true","49.6"," 37 of 42 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","37","42","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/EpicKingdom_/recommended/400800/","EpicKingdom_","EpicKingdom_","http://steamcommunity.com/id/EpicKingdom_/","253 products in account","PROS\nGameplay is more realistic when comparing to other motocross games such as Reflex, Alive, Supercross ENCORE, and MUD, etc. For example, you have control over the dirtbike's clutch, rear brake, front brake, and can shift gears manually. Also, use the left stick to control the bike and the right stick to control the rider's movements. All of these controls really matter as you approach certain parts of the tracks such as hairpin turns, berms, jumps, etc. Moving on, during a race, you have sessions such as practice or qualifying and then the actual race that conists of two heats.\n\nScrubs and whips look pretty good.\n\nUse a Xbox controller to play.\n\nCareer mode is great. Compete in MX2 and MXGP with up to 18 national tracks. Also, create your own custom team or join an official team. If you create a custom team, earn a reputation and sponsers. Either route you take, you must meet certain expectations of that team/sponser or be fired. For example, your sponser may ask that you gain a certain amount of points or do better than a competitor during the current race week. Each race has two heats (as stated before) with each heat offering a maximum of 25 points. At the end, you will either move up or down in the MX2/MXGP season rankings.\n\nBEST graphics seen for a motocross game. Check out my screenshot for example!\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=668129475\n\nCustomization is fun and awesome, but it would be nicer if there were more brands or things to choose from as far as gear goes and bike parts. I'm hoping for a modding community to start up to cover this.\n\nThere is a lovely test track for you to play around on or test your new customized bike.\n\nYou can now race on supercross tracks.\n\nThe A.I. can be challenging. Overall, they can make you feel like you're having a battle or that you have to work hard for first place.\n\nThere's cool stastitics tab within the main menu that shows your race results such as the number of times that you took first place, second, or third etc.\n\n2560x1440p support, the first MXGP did not have offical support of this resolution.\n\nThere are some other neat modes like, "real events" that have you relive moments from real life MXGP 2015. Also, there's a game mode for monster energy FIM MXoN which is a "team event scheduled at the end of the FIM Motocross World Championship, in which the riders compete representing their own country."\n\nCONS\nThe A.I. can be an unstoppable force. In other words, they will knock you off of your bike easily if they touch you while turning. Also, the A.I. (all of them) take the same lines while racing. Overall, these two issues with the A.I. can make playing singleplayer extremely annoying or frustrating.\n\nWhen I tried multiplayer, the A.I. as well as real players were bugged. For example, the arms to their riders were moving awkwardly which was kind of distracting. I suggest racing without A.I. when online. Overall, the online gameplay was still playable. I had no lag issues.\n\nI've noticed that certain A.I. riders always finish in the top 10 or 5 which can make the gameplay feel repetitive since I always know who to expect behind me or battling with me.\n\nFalling off the track (even if you can easily hop back on) can reset your bike and rider making you loose your position in the race.\n\nAttempting to clear doubles or triples can feel/look akward or tough. The same goes for turning. There's so many hairpin turns in this game and so much lack of legit berms to rail. Sometimes I get really frustrated since I have to really slow down to make some of these turn otherwise I will turn so wide that I loose ground against the other racers. Overall, turning in this game can feel realistic and unrealistic at times.\n\nThe sounds of the bikes are really terrible. Also, there's no great music within the menu or during a race. No real bands/singers or anything like that.\n\nOVERALL\nThis game is worth it if you are a motocross fan. I believe that MXGP2 is the BEST motocross game to come out SINCE Reflex. (I never liked the first MXGP).\n\nPlease thumbs up if you found this review helpful!

Certainly not perfect. I would say 7 out of 10.\n\nPhysics are not nearly as good as Reflex, but i havn't seen any game since to beat that. And contrary to all the negative reviews: they actually changed gameplay and added loads of new features. For example:\n\n- scrub/whip improved. Its still arcade style and not as good as Reflex, but it isn't the animation it used to be in the previous game. Its now fully under the players controls.\n- cutting off tracks, wich lead to lots of cheating online, is now fixed. This sometimes leads to sudden resets of the bike when you go off track. But i rather get used to riding on track, then have all the cheating.\n- Stadium tracks are added.\n- Lots of customazation of your bike is added.\n- You can now run your own team.\n- And quite a lot more new features...\n\nTo sum up the pro's and con's.\n\nPro's:\n- Great graphics, by far the best in its genre\n- All the original tracks, teams, names (to me this is worth a lot)\n- Loads of new features compared to the previous game\n- Changes, like whip/scrub control, make me feel that the developers did listen to the players requests\n\nCon's:\n- Meh.... physics\n- Still the terrible engine sounds\n- Performace is great, but you've got to test quite a couple of settings before you find the right one\n- Still some bugs from the previous game, but no game changing ones","April 8","true","16.4"," 36 of 46 people (78%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","78","36","46","3","1"

Other than that they only added a bit more customization options. I also like that the second track in the career has the same sound glitch where the engine sound disapears as in the first game, that proves that they didn't even change the engine sounds or did any fixes...\nOverall, really disappointed and I was expecting a lot more.\nPerformance is great to be honest, doesn't lag at all with max settings at 1200p.

Its very similar to MXGP, but with lots of new tracks and some more customization.\n\nIf you are on a tight gaming budget I would say wait awhile for a sale or if you haven't played the first one or mx vs atv reflex pick that up for now.  I still say this is the best dirtbike simulator, that is fairly realistic, has nice tracks (18) with hilly terrain that you can feel, need to actually brake rather than just go full throttle all the time and has good graphics. Its basically an extention of MXGP with more content.\n\nExample, a feature I don't care for is if you go a bit off the track, they reset you.

And I've played pretty much every MX game going back to excite bike on the NES to having 277 hours in Reflex on the Steam/PC version alone (double that counting time spent on the Xbox 360 version). They really nailed it with physics, gameplay, graphics, and detail. There's so much detail you can even see the welds in the swingarm! I came in expecting just a MXGP1 re-hash with some added tracks but it feels and looks totally overhauled with the exception of sounds which the rest is so good I can almost completely forgive the the sound which falls behind the quality of the rest of the game.\n\nBut just to be warned, there's a learning curve with the updated physics. Like I said, I was expecting just a re-hash of MXGP and thought my same techniques would all carry over but it turned out to be quite different! And it's all for the better! Now to powerslide corners, or rail the inside line and blast out of the corners ripping you have to utilise the clutch and leaning where as in the first game I almost never had to use the lean much and never used the clutch. The bike has a much softer feel now as well. Gone are the days when it looked and sounded so stiff almost to where you had no suspension when landing or blasting whoops. The suspension has a real plush feel to it now.\n\nThe replay system is also much improved. You can fast forward and rewind at varying speeds using the RT and LT on a xbox controller. You can really get some sick screenshots with the replay! I can really go on and on about all the improvements and how good the game is, but just take it from someone who used to race in real life and has played nearly every MX game to date going back to the 80's, this is the best one by a long shot! I'm glad to see so many developers of racing games steering more towards realism these days instead of arcade physics and Milestone won't dissapoint you if you're looking for realism! Real tracks, real riders, realistic graphics and handling, what else could you possibly want? Plus for us older guys that used to race for real, this satisfies the MX racing crave but is so much safer, i.e. no broken bones to deal with, lol.

I was expecting a lot more like a game than the game promises and offers. The game also does not offer much the reforms or improvements that usually a new video game might expect.\n\nI was expecting also that, the game would have been a multi-profile support which I had hoped the forum of the game for many weeks before the game's release but, it did not come and the game's customization options are pretty non-existent.\n\nChanges largely is more visual, which is used for a few 3d model of which is available then only a few color option.\n\nIf the video game would not have the possibility of customization, so the game would be almost identical at the same video game than an old MXGP game release.\n\nThe game is the gameplay is completely identical and as a game pretty much the same game as the the old MXGP game release but, just a little updated, as well as the driver list.\n\nSure, this video game developed and reached forward & game is not entirely bad at all but, the game did not offer myself enough new and significant improvement, which is an older game release contain.\n\nSo, if you happen to own an older release of the game, so I do not recommend necessarily to buy this game but, if you buy a motocross game for the first time, so this is a good choice.\n\nI gonna refund this a game, sadly...\n\n\nFIN:\n\nPienen testailun jälkeen peli oli itselleni melkoisen suuri pettymys.

It improved on the first MXGP in many ways. The graphics are touched up, the physics were redone, very weird at first but after awhile they are fine. The customization from the career rider stand point was well needed. The stadium series is a major let done as the tracks are far smaller then any mx game that has "supercross". The much needed addition of 22 riders was a big thing for me. The only REAL downside for me is that the game appears to have some serious frame rate lag. 20-30 fps while in races and 100fps while in the menus has me a bit concerned but then again that could very well be on my end. I say if you are hoping for a better MXGP then go ahead and purchase. Yeah the price of $50 is a bit concerning but then again the demand for Motocross games is very high.

Track and Objects are ok too, even though I have to play on normal ground settings since this game seems to have a bad PC port.\n\nEverything off track:\nCustomization is simply awesome. Even though I wish there was more gear, like Bell or 6D helmets and Shift gear (some AIs wear them, so they're obviously available). Career mode is ok, but I don't see any motivation in the long run. No qualification race? No seperate trainings?\n\nPhysics:\nOh my... It's pretty hard to figure out. 4 hours in it now, I still struggle big time. The pace itself is very slow in comparison to games like MvA Supercross Encore or MX Simulator. I think the engine is based on their street bike games, and that's their biggest mistake. You don't magically fly into the air when the rear tire slides out or when you are still a little bit leaned on the face of a jump. In combination with slow pace this results in many frustrating moments where you can just watch how the rider crashes without really understanding why or being able to do something. Also you can't block pass anyone since you always crash when you ride through a corner and someone is on your outside. Very annoying. I really do hope that they start from scratch for the engine of MXGP 3 because dirt bikes and street bikes is a whole different world.\n\nSound:\nPlease Milestone studios, fire the guys that you hired for this. It's terrible. Nothing more to say.\n\nFazit:\n+ Customization\n+ All tracks and riders\n+ One of the few studios to actually read the opinions of the players and work that critic\n+ Solid graphics\n+ no major bugs on release day\n\n+- Physics are very arcardy and sometimes unpredictable\n\n- PC Port (I see a lot of other people complaining about not even getting 60fps.

The AI put up a good challenge, I'm having some real battles. Physics are fantastic as long as you have them on pro, watch any replay after a race and the movements look spot on. Get a few upgrades on the bike and it brakes and controls alot better too. Whip controls and physics are a little bit odd but an improvment over the previous MXGP. Nice graphics too, love taking screenshots in replays.

The physics are still the same, and I am ok with that. That being said about the physics, there are still some changes to how you drive the bike, like scrubs, weight transfer etc. The new rewind feature is very useful, helps alot when you make a mistake that could cost you the race (I just wish there was a points bonus for not using the rewinds but no biggie). The customization in this game is very detailed, whether it be the riders equipment or the everything about the bike. I love how they setup the career mode, how you can create your own team and make everything look the way you want, or you can join a real team. Presentaion has been improved, all those stupid generic presentations at the end of the race are gone. Graphics look very good, you can definatley see the difference between this years and last years game. This game posts a bigger challenge in the difficulty, which is very good cause i was running circles around the competition in last years game even on the hard and realistic difficulties.

Several swear words and a broken controller later, I have some conclusions.\n\nIt is great. It's better than the first. The handling is different and at times can seem a touch too sensitive, but once you get used to it, it really is nice. The whips and scrubs are slightly improved. The new layout is a bit add at first, but again, once you get used to it, it's fine.\n\nThe game runs pretty smoothly, with only a slight hiccup here and there. It is nowhere near as bad as MX vs ATV Encore was (that game did get a decent patch to fix most problems).\n\nThere are new tracks and some from the previous game have been removed.  Of course, most Americans (like myself) will probably wish there were more US tracks, but this is MXGP after all and not Lucas Oil Nationals. Thankfully Glen Helen is now on the schedule and most of the removed tracks are ones I didn't care much for anyway. The addition of the MXON is nice, although I'm a little disappointed that I cannot use my custom team in it. Oh well, at least I can represent USA and create the ending I would have preferred for last year's race. The indoor races are more Arenacross than Supercross. They are very tight and by the end of it you will probably hate Nagl, Febvre, and Gajser. Maybe it's a good thing they don't have the license for the US series.\n\nThe AI is improved and takes much better lines. I still have yet to bump it back up to the highest setting, but they are definitely more aggresive. Again, you'll probably end up hating quite a few guys. The only problem is a lot of times inside passes result in tipovers from the AI, although this seems to be true in most MX games.\n\nOverall, I wish there were a few things different, such as first-person starts and the clutch assignment not locking up the game, but this series is well on it's way and with any luck, maybe, just maybe, one day there will be an installment for the US series.","April 11","true","44.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The problem is when you get stuck in the back of the pack, passing other riders on the inside is nearly impossible. If you get to close to them you automatically fall down for no reason. The other rider doesn't even move and you fall losing at least a few positions. I'm not sure why this happens because in real life, if you get to the inside of another rider, they will be pushed wide and you'll get the position with no issues. The reason that I find this a problem in game is because moving up through the pack is not realistic and everytime you get the position on another rider in the corner, your guy just falls off and it ruins the race.

They feel like the closest to actual racing than any other motocross game I have played. You really do have to plan your lines ahead and make sure you are applying the right braking style around certain corners. I haven't played the first MXGP, but i have played games like MX vs. ATV: Reflex and the movements feel much more realistic and passing people actually feels like an accomplishment. I also find it pretty cool that when you lean, you reallly have to be careful because lean to much and you are in the dirt.\n\nThe customization options are an awesome factor as well. I was almost able to perfectly recreate my own Yamaha with American flag graphics! There are so many brands to choose from includ Fox, FMF, and Renthal. The only problem i ran into while customizing my bike was a constant flickering that would appear on the bike, but the developers are already aware through discussions and are probably already fixing it.\n\nMy favorite mode so far is the Career mode, where you get to race with the MXGP 2015 Roster. Although i don't really follow those races as I like to watch AMA Supercross in America, I am having a blast making my own character and bringing him up in the ranks.\n\nGraphics-wise the game looks and runs great with my fps staying between 50-60fps on the max settings.  Here are my specs:\ni7 4790k\nAMD Radeon R9290x 4gb\n16gb Ram\n\nThe most common complaint that i do find relevent is the sounds of the game. The engine noises are not up to par and can be made more realistic as well as maybe the crashes. However, this problem does not take my enjoyment away from the game and shouldn't be the deciding factor in purchasing the game or not in my opinion.\n\nOverall, the gameplay is stellar but that is not to say that there are things that could be worked on. I definitely recommend this game to fans of the sport or anyone that enjoys realistic racing games.\n\nCheers!\n","April 8","true","17.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Maybe this will appeal to fans of the sport more.\n\nComments:\nThis feels like a simpler original Wip3out or RC Stunt Copter, and I feel that is high praise. The solid inertia feel and the gameplay are really solid and worthy of recommendation alone. Perhaps the AI is a little easy to beat (I haven't and probably won't play multiplayer) but the satisfaction that can be gained by learning lines and getting them right make this well worth the money if you're a fan of solid no-nonsense racers.

Fun to ride, scale works well.\n-Customisation of bike and rider has been enhanced since MXGP1 (would like to see more brands though)\n-Sponsor system still in place.\n\nCons:\n-SOUND.... I once had a dvd player that sounded more like a bike than this.\n-Speed of the bikes and gearing seem well off... 1st gear is like running pace, no sensation of acceleration through the range what so ever.\n-Ridged as a bread stick while jumping... Scubbing is okay I guess, nothing amazing. Cannot control pitch in a way that feels true to jumping a real bike.\n-Block passing or merely just riding on the inside of AI will force you to crash. (needs fixing)\n-Supercross (or stadiumcross) is horrible.\n\nOverall:\nI bought this knowing how fun the first game was, doing the seasons over and having battles while the AI was still difficult but MXGP2 has taken that all away. While the tracks and graphics are better, the main core of the game is still broken but this time I can't bare to even complete a full season.\n\nBUY? No, wait for a patch to see if any of these things have been fixed but don't hold your breath on Milestone delivering support.","April 16","false","18.9"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","2"

I really loved MXGP1 for the most part and was excited for the release of this game......until I installed it last night. The game will not assign/map our buttons with my Logitech controller properly.....If I try to assign button 1 for the gas, the game randomly assigns a different button on screen....then in gameplay, it is an entirely button. This also happened in MXGP1 and I was really hoping this game would be different. It also wont let you assign a new button for the clutch......it just locks the game and you have to do a force shutdown to back out. I did this 4 times before giving up. The bike also turns very sensitive and zig zags all over the track uncontrollably. I have a high end gaming PC and this game is choppy and laggy. I can run Fallout 4, Call of Duty, Far Cry all on max settings with zero lag but this game lags badly. For this release, you guys should have knocked it out of the park but instead you gave us MXGP1 with better tracks.  The bike physics(turning wise) was 100% better on the first game. The sounds are also awful. Not sure why you could not update this more.......This game is full of bugs and I can't believe you would release this. You need to come up with some fixes and patches and help us out here.\nThe tracks all look great.......it's a shame I can't play the game......PLEASE FIX THE ISSUES WITH MAPPING OUT THE CONTROLS!!!!!!","April 8","false","3.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Game breaking bugs and I haven't even finished through a Qualifying session yet, let alone gotten to a race in single player or multiplayer.  First, changing the Clutch control for an Xbox 360 tournament controller, causes the controls to freeze, and you can do nothing but control+alt+delete to X out of the game and start over.  Ok, no huge deal, I was able to manipulate other inputs to get the Clutch button where I wanted it.  Then, 2nd lap into Qualifying in Maggiano, first race, I go into a turn, game freezes, makes a loud ERRRRRRRR noise like a solid noise alarm, 5-8 seconds later, it literally reboots my computer.  I'm prompted with black and white screen saying Windows did not shut down properly, and asking me if I wanted to reboot in safe mode or normally.  You know that screen.  I rebooted normally.  System specs: Win 7, 64 bit, I7-4790K, Gigabyte GTX 980 G1 Gaming, 2560x1440 Asus ROG Swift monitor.  Unreal.  I haven't even mentioned how the game feel just sucks.  For anyone saying it's the same game as MXGP, they obviously haven't played MXGP.  MXGP 2 is definitely different, and I'm not sure for the better.  Controls are too sensitive.  Zig zagging all over the track blah blah blah.  I'm an A class rider/racer for last 12+ years, and this cr** just misses the mark.  Overall, graphics are a little better, and customization is obviously possible whereas in MXGP it was not.  You've been warned.  Really upset about it rebooting my system like that.  I can handle a few bugs here and there, and even restarting the game on occasion, but crashing the whole system is not acceptable. Like I said you've been warned.  I'd be getting a refund on it if I didn't leave it on while making dinner the other night.  I'm over the 2 hour limit on refunds.  Not that Steam would do it automatically anyway.  I had 42 minutes on Space Engineers and wanted a refund, and the crooks wounldn't refund me that.  So all I can say is buy at your own risk.  I have a PS4, might have been worth waiting until June to get it on that.  PC games are going to sh**.  So sad.\n\nEDIT: And don't get me started on the sounds.  Absolutely horrible sounding bikes.  They sound nothing like a motocross bike.  When you let go of the gas in the air, the sound virtually does not change at all.  So unrealistic.\n\nEDIT 2: For all you people downvoting my review and not finding it helpful, Suck it!!!  You're just jealous that you suck at riding in real life and I would merk you cats, and you're also just jealous that I have a baller a** gaming pc and you're very peasant-like with your fanboy AMD chips and radeon graphics cards hahahahahahahAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH!!!!!  I hate AMD fanboys.\n\nEDIT 3: After playing for 21 hours, the most annoying parts of the game are washing out when you slightly tap another bike when trying to make a pass on the inside of them, and not being able to change stock rims AT ALL to aftermarket rims.  We're losing out on 0.4 acceleration and 0.4 handling, which would bring those values up from 8.8 to 9.2 each.  Such BS.  Nothing I do in "customize" will allow me to run aftermarket rims in game during career mode.  And also, while I feel that first person camera has improved slighty, how can this not be fixed completely by now?  What a waste.  Doesn't anybody who makes these games ride a dirtbike at all?  First person view is not right.  You need to be able to see the front fender and handlebars more to know what the heck your bike is doing underneath you.  It had potential but it's a failure.","April 9","false","48.9"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","0"

I also get the idea that the jump shapes are a lot better, alot more immersive when u feel the rear spiring propel you up in the air.\nThe tracks don't tend to become 'unridable' after a large amount of laps. In mxgp tracks would be a totally destroyed after 3 laps especially in the sand.It was terrible all traction was gone and the track felt like soup or whatever but regretfully still no realistic deformation system. Although it feels 100% better then last game, a real improvement on how the type of soil feels under you'r bike.And also how the track shapes up during a moto. This subject will still need an insane amount of work to even come close to realism, but if we keep this line of improvement up it will be sooner then you'd think.\nStill whipping and air movement is not excactly up to par yet but has also came a long way from last game at least it's funcional right now. Im maybe to used to MX-simulator a lil to much, i so love the freedom you have in the air in that game.\nThe A.I. has got a lil faster aswell nothing shocking but sometimes when i fall i don't win at least on a stock bike. it's just that they only ride one line and if they wheel tap you you'r going down. Als when you try to take inside line and block pass, you go down. The AI just don't seem to slow down or even take you into account, also they seem to weigh a lot more then you do thus you are alway's the victim.It still needs a lot of work to be closer to realism.\nthe rewind thingey is not for me but i get that some people will like it. I would really like to a more competetive A.I. still.\n\nThe sounds is one one of most talked about things by people so imma leave that out. :)\n\nIt has to be said that on sometimes like in Neuquen when u jump down into that left handed roller section, it has a frame drop and not just at the start every single lap. It's really annoying and has to be fixed if you ask me.\n\nAlso the Multiplayer is not working (yet), i tryed to make an account but i dont get the activation email\nare you guys at Milestone gonna fix this? After i while i did find out that the confirmation mail for the acount is only sent to G-mail acounts for some reason...So if you wanna play get a G-mail acount or wait for Milestone to fix this.\n\nAll in all i think the progress made by Milestone in between games is awesome,still it's not the perfect motocross game.\nBut at least the line is moving up instead of MX vs Atv Supercross which i don't even wanna talk about.\nI'm looking for great things to come in the future but for now i'm satisfied with what this game has brought me so far.","April 8","true","28.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

After Doing a few races and earning some credits I modded out a bike and I am having a lot more fun with the game. I like how they have all the brand names of aftermarket parts, Pro Circuit, Renthal, Ohlins etc. I am running an i5 4690k CPU with a GTX 970 GPU and I can max out everything and get no frame drops.\nThe physics are like the first game but seem a bit more refined, you can't just go hauling ♥♥♥ into a corner and power your way out. You have to brake, lean and get on the gas with good timing.\nMy only complaint so far is the AI, they always take the inside line and they never checkup if you try and take the line away from them. They just ram you and you end up on the ground as they ride away. It also seems like the AI doesn't spread out very much from 1st to 22nd place, last place crosses the line only 15-20 seconds after first place. I don't know what races the devs are watching but I don't think 1st place and 22nd have ever finished that close IRL. This means if you fall you get passed by a ton of guys. I was playing on Hard difficulty, running second place behind Herlings and I fell, got back up in 11th. I was pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥.\nOverall the game is fun and should have pretty good replay value, especially for moto fans.\nPLEASE ADD SOME REAL EXHAUST SOUND EFFECTS!!\n","April 20","true","10.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Im saying this because the sounds are nothing close to a motorcycle and there isnt even a rev limiter and its a 4-stroke. most of you probaly dont notice or anything because you just like racing or kinda arcadish games and are not comepletly a serious motocross person who knows all about bikes and stuff. But those who are more serious about it probaly know what im trying to say. It just realy takes away from the games with sounds that dont even correspond with anything. I realy hope there will eventualy be a mod team that can add to what im getting at. Like for example, mxsimulator not the best graphics but is also an old game. it is still realy fun and there are still mod teams that make bikes in it and graphics and sound mods to make the game completly seem new or different in a better way. i realy hope some members from gp can understand or for there next game even add things in the sound catagory and im sure over time they will add more to the coustumiztion category in the game.

How do you feel?\n\nTHE ENGINE SOUND!!\n\nWhy cant they get it right? The bike sound needs to be more realistic to run along side the Amazing job they have done with the feel of the riding experience? The game feels great. The reason it dose my head in is that I ride 2 STROKE!! Why do they sound like a 4 stroke? I can live with the 4 stroke engine JUST! & think this could be improved too. I cant play any game without sound? Dont know about you? Please please please go and record some engines then add them to the game?? How can in 2016 this not be possible? just get on a bike, record the sound as it goes around the track and cut the sounds you want. We all know how great motocross bikes sound so add it in the game please. You dont get this with say F1 games do you? How would F1 fanatics feel if the cars sounded like tractors going around the track? The feel is taken away from realisticness.\n\nSorry for the rant guys but it just dose my head in:( Any one else with me? & How do we get them to look at this?\n\n","May 24","true","121.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I'll start with the graphics: motorbikes and pilots are well reproduced, the motorbikes in particular look very detailed and gorgeous when covered with mud. the tracks are well designed, whereas the crowd and the details on the side don't look very convincing. The overall impression is that itmay not be the most advanced game in therms of graphics, but it's still pleasant to look at and it is stable and fluid. The sound effects are ok, I don't have experience with this kind of motorbikes so I don't really know how accurate their sound reproduction is.\nThe gameplay is a bit arcadey, and is fun: touching with others is not to punishing and they don't seem stupid. With a bit of practice you'll soon start to take the difficulty level and physics level up for a more challenging experience. I find ridiculous, even if it is really not a big issue, that you can change direction while flying after a jump, like super mario.\nThe game offers a good variety of game modes, ensuring thus a lasting experience. I am still doing the first part of the career, which is fine, I hope that at any point something spectacular will come out, like for example the 24h of Le Mans in GRID, to provide a climax of some sort.\nIn conclusion, I think MXGP2 might not be super impressive at first but is a good game with lots of fun for many hours.","May 8","true","36.4"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Here's my reasoning.\n\nAfter spending a fair bit of time on the game already, the career layout is really well done. I like the weekend proceedings of each event, and it's an enjoyably realistic aspect of the game. The graphics are also very good, on par with any of the MVA games IMO. The aspect that fails massively, is the physics engine. I guess it's ok if you're into Motocross Madness 1 and ♥♥♥♥in Mario Kart? Feels like i'm riding a brick on two wheels and trying to drift it around corners. There's not much control that I can have in air, and it's very sluggish in response.\n\nOverall, it's a fun game for someone who hasn't touched MX Simulator, but in comparison to a game of that caliber, it's extremely arcade-ish in feel in contrast.\n\nSuggestions for this game would be to perhaps use a physics engine that's a cross between MX Sim and MVA Reflex? Something with some more control of the bike placement while in-air, while still needing to be careful with throttle control in ruts etc.\n\nIf I'd tried this game before i bought it I'd have waited until it was ♥♥♥♥in $2.25 on special. That's all I'm saying.\n\nI'm not a smoker, have a low-sugar diet, and dont spend prolonged time in the sun, but I think it was all for nothing, because this game may have given me terminal cancer anyway.","April 18","false","13.8"," 5 of 14 people (36%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","36","5","14","6","0"

Took me a while to get used to the bikes controls however after an hour of playing I was able to ride perfectly. The customization for bikes and charactor is as good as it looks in the trailer, however I would have really loved a fully sandbox mode where you can customize the bike to the top tear stuff and play around with some kind of track creation tool. The career mode is well made and I love that you can get sponsorships, it really feels like I'm making my way up the ranks in the motocross world.
