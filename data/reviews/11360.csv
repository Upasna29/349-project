First: The game "Chains" is no big deal. That means the game mechanics are quite simple and the graphics are flatten. But what it makes special is the relaxing chillout soundtrack in the background. Never felt so comfortable in a game.\n\nThe levels are generally easy. You have to link the same colored bubbles to chains, as longer as better. Sometimes there are pretty inventive modes like calculation numbers inside the bubbles to a balance or to deny downfalling bubbles to block a tube by upchaining and eliminate them. There's all kind of challenge and entertainment you can expect from a good puzzle game.\nTake a -90% Coupon and pay only 40 Cent to tryout all the great 20 levels.","March 21, 2014","true","3.0"," 38 of 52 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","38","52","0","5"

The graphics are what you would expect from this sort of game. Most people should be able to beat all 20 levels in 2 hours or so.\n\nI'm not recommending this because it is over priced but if you can get it for $0.50 - $1 then it is definitly worth checking out.","September 7, 2014","false","2.1"," 21 of 24 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","21","24","3","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ladynarayan/recommended/11360/","ladynarayan","Narayan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ladynarayan/","393 products in account","Chains is a game about linking 3+ bubbles of the same colour. It features 20 puzzles, each different from one another. Rules, objectives, layout change from one puzzle to the next, sometimes even the gravity is modified.\n\nBasically though there are two types: puzzles that make you think a little, and puzzles where you have to act fast. Unfortunately there is much more of the "act fast" ones. When I got this game I thought it will be relaxing & laid-back. It wasn't most of the time. Chains require focus, reflex and speed, which makes it rather tense experience, stressful even. Hey, I'm old ^^>\n\nI finished the game, although that turned out to be a test of patience. The progress I made was wiped a couple of times or rolled back (I had severe saving issues for some reason), so I was forced to repeat each puzzle at least a couple of times. Without all that repetition the game is very short.\n\nI'm recommending this because "on fence" or "so-so" is not an option. Plus Chains isn't bad, so thumbs down would be unfair. Also, I like the music/ambiance, the art style/ design choice and the variety. I appreciate each puzzle being different (even though not my speed), as I'm often tired with games that have hundreds of carbon copy puzzles with barely any modifications. Ideas for some puzzles/ level design are neat as well :)","February 8, 2015","true","4.3"," 20 of 26 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","20","26","0","0"

It's a SURPRISINGLY and REFRESHINGLY GOOD match 3 (or more) physics puzzler. Normally, I'd shy away from either of those genre's, but it was a small download thanks to the Indie Royale Prarie Dog bundle. The main mechanic is linking adjacent, like colored orbs together in chains of 3 or more. Left click to link, right click to cancel - those are your controls. The goal widely varies from level to level - the first level requires you to just make enough chains, the next requires to continue making chains on a weight based door before it becomes too heavy with constantly falling orbs. One level requires you to keep a stream of orbs falling while preventing clogs in a "pipe" level, another has you try to make a big chain as orbs fly from the edges of the screen to the center based on gravity. Another has you link different sized orbs that are worth points relative to their size, and you have to make a chain with the exact score. It's surprisingly clever and very enjoyable with a great soundtrack (A link to the artist's page is on the game's site). The cheap gradient effect of the orbs kinda clash with the crisp, PixelJunk-esq background graphics (which look good IMO), but it's not the worst thing in the world. I got through half of the game in about 30 minutes, so you can probably beat the game in a couple hours, unless you get stuck (I'm stuck on Level 11). A very neat title that I'm glad that I found.","August 24, 2013","true","2.7"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

On the game's 20 levels you're tasked with clearing balls from the screen by linking a chain of length 3 or more of the same colour while aiming for a certain objective like not dropping any off the stage or not leaving any behind when cleared.  Each level presents its own type of challenge but with the same underlying mechanic of clearing chains.  Because each level does not take too long to finish and when you do fail it's very clear why, you will never get frustrated enough to give up.\n\nSome negatives:\n-Progress is not saved after completing each level unless you quit to the main menu.  This is an issue as the game tends to crash if alt-tabbing while in fullscreen.\n-Game is rather short.  Easily finished normal mode in one sitting.\n\nRecommended for puzzle fans but pick it up cheap.","December 28, 2013","true","2.8"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

Ranging from simple objectives such as get a high score to more complicated objectives such as keep a stream with multiple choke points flowing for 5 minutes.\n\nThe aesthetic is simple, colored dots and silhouette containers.That and the simplistic menu design are reminiscent of Flash games, but it doesn't have much impact on the game.

That's a pretty good deal in my opinon at least. I like to think of these types of games as Flash Games, or rather those you can play on the internet for free. Thus meaning I do think the price on this is a bit to high, and 99 cents instead would be quite a great deal.\n\nCompared to a free web game, this game offers the same amount of gamplay, level systems and what not, you finish one you go the next, pretty simple. But that also means that is the only things it offers if you know what I mean.\n\nMy most favorite feature of the game is the soundtrack. I can listen to it all day playing the game, or just sitting around. I also think it goes perfectly with the games feel, being a puzzle game.\n\nEven though this game is farely simple it didn't give instructions, or something on those line.

If the price was 99 cents or something, I probally still would not have bought it, that is just because I don't like Puzzle games in general.

You will likely be able to beat this entire game in around 2-3 hours, and most of that will be spent on the last few levels. For example, there are only 20 levels, and I was up to level 16 inside of one hour, then hit a wall. There is a nice variety in the levels, but I wish there were simply more of them, and the difficulty took a more gradual progression.\n\nThe graphics are fit their purpose perfectly, except that I wish there was a more drastic difference between the yellow and green colors. I'm not colorblind to any degree, but when you're frantically trying to manage multiple areas of the level, it really helps to have a stark difference between all the colors, so as to see them all at a glance. Speaking of which, the game does include a colorblind mode, although I didn't try it.\n\nThe music is pleasant and non-distracting, but don't expect to remember any of it once you've exited the game. It, like the sounds and graphics, is there merely to serve a purpose, then be forgotten.\n\nI liked what I've played so far (I'm on level 18 right now), but even as an avid puzzle game fan, I can't recommend this for $5. The premise is just slightly too basic, and gameplay is just slightly too short. It feels like a free Android game, where you have to purchase additional level packs.\n\nOverall, the game is pleasant, but not overly enjoyable. I would probably give it a 70/100.","June 14, 2013","true","1.4"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

It sounds kind of exciting that way, but in reality, some of the levels are just too difficult because of the random allocation of colours.\n\nIt's a puzzle game that you can't solve; a supposedly calm and relaxing game that often comes down to your twitch-reflex and your ability to spot when the game hands you the solution after hours and hours of combinations that make it literally impossible to pass the levels. And when you get stuck on a certain level that you know how to beat *in theory* but can't actually beat because the game keeps sending down purple bubbles into the middle of the yellow-bubble chain you've been building... it's just not fun.\n\nThe music is ok, and that's about the best thing I have to say for Chains. The level ideas are cool but poorly executed; so much so that a cool concept becomes abject torture... the graphics are quirky and somewhat artful the first time around, but after thirty attempts at the same level it loses any of interest from trying to figure out the "flow" and you're left staring at something that looks like childrens' scribble... and even when you do manage to pass an impossible level on a lucky run, it's only a matter of 1-2 more levels before you're stuck again and don't come back to play for months at a time...\n\nseriously, the only reason I'm writing this review now is because I came back to Chains again because I had nothing else to do, and realised that this game held no interest whatsoever for me. I can't find any reason to reccomend this game to play, let alone to buy. This should have been a browser game; and even then it wouldn't be a very good take on its genre without some major balance adjustments.","November 5, 2014","false","1.6"," 9 of 19 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","9","19","0","0"

They're very similar colours, and for a colour blind player like me, that's a *big* problem. But even if that weren't the case, the difficulty curve on this game is highly erratic. Level 1: Match up 100, no biggy, they don't fall too fast, and none of them drop off the bottom of the screen. Level 2? Get 200, they fall fairly rapidly, and if you don't clear them very quickly indeed, a hatch is opened by the pressure of the balls, and you inevitably lose.\n\nConsidering you can't move on to the next level without beating the previous one? That's a difficulty spike that's just going to turn people off this game. Just as it turned me off this game.\n\nSo, in summary, this game is distinctly colour blind unfriendly, has highly erratic difficulty, and it's a case of "too tense, too early", a bad trait in an action puzzle game.

While it's exceedingly unlikely that any further updates will come, keep in mind that this could be outdated by any further patches to the game.\n\nChains is a combination physics-based and tile-matching puzzle game, in which the player creates the eponymous “chains” by connecting brightly colored “bubbles” to other, like-colored bubbles. Once a chain of 3 or more is created, it's removed, and the remaining bubbles fall in place.  The “physics” portion comes not only from that, but in certain levels that are designed around the weight of each bubble, and thus introduce a new element of strategy.\n\nThere is no finite goal to the game; each stage has a different objective the player must reach, with each level changing to reflect the current task. Some tasks require more pause, like “Match the given amount in one chain.” Others are a race against another mechanic, such as, “Clear 200 without losing any.” by which the weight of the balls are pulling on a counter weight that, when overwhelmed, will mean the balls can fall out of the level, and the player fails the current stage.\n\nThe game is controlled via the mouse alone, and even if there were controller support, it probably wouldn't be wanted. As is, the mouse isn't terribly precise, and one can fail levels solely due to the fact that the “link” of the chain didn't register one's mouse movement.\n\nThere are 20 stages, each with varying difficulty. The player may find one level to be as easy as using the game's core mechanic until the goal is reached, while others prove substantially more challenging, with failure encroaching even before the player has a chance to counteract it.  The varying difficulty seems like an odd design choice, as one can also change the difficulty setting of their profile, creating two separate points of variable difficulty. It's also jarring and frustrating to have a difficulty curve that looks less like a steady climb, and more like EKG waves. One is also barred from moving to the next stage until the current one is completed, a perplexing choice given the erratic challenge levels. It would feel less like the levels were simply thrown together if they were ordered, or at least grouped, by relative difficulty.\n\nFurther disorientation comes from the rules also changing for the different stages. For example, the stage to clear a specific amount is very strict about which direction one can go in order to create a chain.  This is directly followed by a stage that allows one to clip halfway through another sphere in order to create a link.  As a result, the gameplay is left feeling haphazard, as the rules the game teaches the player initially, aren't necessarily the rules for the next level. Mechanics can often feel as if they aren't consistent in-level, either; a notion exacerbated by the fact that connections can be made while the bubbles are still moving.\n\nThe sound design is similarly strange: it's not bad, but it seems either too similar or out-of-place. The sound effects for clearing bubbles are fine, and the “fail” noise is also adequate, but the “You're about to fail.” and “Hey, you're #/# of the way there!” are nearly indistinguishable from one another. This is a negative because the more fast-paced levels require the player's utmost attention, and they can't look away to the HUD or text in the corner without losing focus.  Further, the music is also not bad, but it's oddly dire for a simple puzzler. It engenders the feel of a Mission Impossible sequence more than it does shiny neon balls rolling around.\n\nI can't recommend Chains.  The puzzles don't build off of each other at all, leaving no coherent tie between the stages; the game feels more like a tour of the applications of a game mechanic, rather than a cohesive experience. I also noted a hiccup where I was green-lit to go to the next level, even though I hadn't met the requirements for the stage I was on, and could find no way to replicate it. Collectors will also be disappointed to note that there are no achievements and no cards available for the game. I can't see this appealing to anyone but diehard fans of Meridian4, or those who simply must have this experience in particular.","January 14, 2015","false","3.3"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

Unless you're like me and have so many games to play/complete.\nAre a few things that put me off a little, first of all £3.99 does seem a little much for it, since it's only 20 levels and can be powered through pretty quick. It would probably be worth it if it had stuff that would increase the replay value i.e. achievements, which is the second thing that put me off a little. This game seems almost made for the achievements system (as there's really not that much else to do after), even if they were just some extra objectives in game, it would make the game better to play, or replay at that.\n\nSeems like a game, I'd probably either uninstall or just go back to once or twice when I'm really bored for a few minutes.
