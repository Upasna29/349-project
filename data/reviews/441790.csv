I've seen a lot of Ark and Rust-like games and they rarely bring anything new to the table. I was pleasantly surprised to find that it was actually pretty enjoyable.\n\nPros:\n-Crafting is reasonably complex, but not overly so.\n-Resource farming isn't overly arduous, drops and locations are predictable and markable on the map.\n-Ranged combat is decent, gunplay is smooth, responsive and quick.\n-Heavy focus towards group/squad-based play.\n-Building system is solid, with a reasonable variety of structure options of various types/appearances/purposes.\n-Graphics are excellent for this stage of development.\n-Survival aspects make themselves constantly known.\n-There's no really bad choice when it comes to skill focus (except maybe melee).\n-Raiding/pvp/base defense are reasonably balanced (but still skewed towards the defenders). You're not likely to lose your base in a 30 second offline raid.\n-Game's pace is pretty well thought-out and progression is steady and rewarding no matter what style of gameplay you prefer.\n-Developers are very open to feedback and discussion, actively engaging the community. (after reporting a bug at 8:00 AM EST, I received a reply from a developer in less than 15 minutes. Now that's service.)\n-Monsters have some cool features like adaptive behavior (passive/aggressive/etc) based on who/what they kill and when/where/how often.\n-Experimenting and testing new skills and content is fun and finding new uses for things is actually very enjoyable.\n\nCons:\n-Some content isn't yet fully supported by the game at this point. Vehicles are temporarily disabled, and player pets don't have fully implemented AI (or so it seems, though they will defend your base).\n-Gameplay is addictive at first, but slowly wears down into the endgame due to lack of endgame content.\n-Raiding in PVP is exceptionally difficult right now, due to weapon damage against structures. (The devs have stated that this is a work in progress).\n-Graphics are nice but some are clearly incomplete with placeholder textures. Certainly not what UE4 is capable of at its peak.\n-Monsters are limited in type. There are currently about 5 different enemy types.\n-Survival can be absolutely brutal sometimes in Normal mode where your items drop on death.\n-There are still some fundamental bugs with the game (losing your armor on death, monster AI, etc)\n-Currently a very small playerbase, especially on PVP servers where guilds are a central focus.\n-Melee combat is lackluster. Ranged combat is fun against players, but repetitive against monsters.\n-Monster combat AI is still very basic with even most boss monsters easily confused by terrain, other monsters, or shiny objects.\n-Crafting, while well thought-out is quite kludgey still. You'll find yourself clicking the craft button a lot (or holding enter). (Update: It's been stated that this will be addressed very soon)\n-No in-game voice chat (yet).\n\nOverall, I like the way this game is going and I'm going to keep an eye on it as it progresses. I wholly endorse supporting these guys and my only concern for the welfare of this game is that the developers might burn themselves out from their rapid development process, or that it might simply get abandoned when "The Repopulation" makes its comeback. I don't feel that either of these scenarios are LIKELY, but these sorts of things are always a concern with any Early Access game. Regardless, it's got my vote.\n\nThumbs up, guys.","May 16","true","227.3"," 67 of 69 people (97%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","97","67","69","0","0"

It isnt ok to spend 10 hours building a base to go to sleep to have it gone in 5 minutes while you slept.\n\nFragmented has an official server mode called "casual pvp".  This means when you die, people cannot loot your body.  THey can still destroy your base and steal your stuff, but you will never lose all your gear.\n\nMeaning it's easier to restart.  It's a huge difference.  Really nice","May 1","true","3.6"," 46 of 56 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","46","56","0","3"

I recommend this game! The game is similar to other survival type games with crafting, hunting, gathering, and also house/town/city building options. This game also offers us an RPG style leveling system as well as a skill tree with ample options to choose from.\n\nThe developers have impressed me during my play and testing time. These developers are responsive to community needs and wants, and they take care of bugs far quicker than most online game development teams. I see updates and bug fix patches almost every single day, and if a major bug surfaces, they often patch a hotfix in the same day.\n\nThe only downside I see currently is that after 60+ hours into this game, I have done most of what there is to do. The flip side of that coin is that the game developers have much much more planned.\n\nI recommend this game to anyone who like the survival or sci-fi genre.","April 26","true","71.4"," 38 of 50 people (76%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","76","38","50","2","0"

They respond to just about anything in a professional and timely manner. Had an issue on a Sunday evening at 8pm Est. and a dev answered the topic within 15 minutes and fixed the issue. Amazing professionalism and detailed responses.\n\nThis is an amazing addition to EA if you love the survival/Sci fi aspect, it has tons and tons of things to gather from wood, stone, berries, twigs, an assortment of food from npcs, gold, diamonds from stones, three big biomes, one desert, snow, and forest with nice amounts of land mass.\n\nThe leveling system has alot of depth, 50 levels of choosing what you want to spend points on to make your character craft more items, like Melee, guns. Electronics, construction and more.... Really huge amount of items to craft and build.\n\nThe music is also really great, an easy to listen to sound track while in the world, really well done. I am more of a PvE player after a long days work to relax and enjoy my time. Met some great people already.\n\nThe building is a work in progress and another couple patches hopefully will see snapping together items. It does have a nice amount of foundations and items to interact with. More in base items would be nice like candles, torches in the base, tables, chairs, trophy cases of npcs killed, etc to fill out the bases.\n\nYou have bots that can follow you around however are a work in progress and disabled at this time, but can still be placed on ground, for example medical bot is awesome, it heals you as you come back to base...\n\nVehicles will be implemented shortly, should be a nice addition.\n\nDefinitely recommend the game, one of the best EA games I have played ever... Loving it....\n\nUpdate 111 hours into the game now....\nMay 22, 2016\n\nReally nice patches and mini patches not only adding features, items but the devs are still very much communicating with us daily at all hours of the day...\n\nStill having a best and the first draft of Genetically engineered Pets is awesome, you can make several different pets that you can craft at a genetic station and they will follow you around, help you in battle. The building mode got a new patch this week and is going in the right direction snap building will be icing in the cake and is something coming to the game...","May 16","true","117.7"," 23 of 25 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","23","25","0","0"

Early Access (at the time of this review) is not yet a week old. My hope is that the users experiencing issues post in the forum instead of (or in addition to) "GG Uninstall" reviews.\n\nAs far as content goes, more is being added in terms of Art, mechanics, and new features.\n\nThere will be modding possibilities and other user-centric items / features beyond the already-planned updates. Check out the official forums for more information or to voice your input.\n\nSome reviews I've seen refer to this as the game they were backing and ABT is making a cash grab. To this: Fragmented is not the game you were backing; That's true. Fragmented is a separate project that former Repopulation backers coincidentally get for free while The Repopulation is being made. It's a survival-type game with a Repopulation theme (simpler crafting, not as deep as Repop will be, etc.).\nThe Repopulation will still be a MMO; It will be its own game. It just needed to get off the Hero Engine which had issues unrelated to ABT. Development was stopped once ABT saw issues coming up with HE's development.\nIf ABT was trying to make a cash grab, they would not give backers copies of this game and would not continue developing The Repopulation. I haven't seen any indication that they've gone back on their word on anything they've promised so far.","May 1","true","44.1"," 37 of 49 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","37","49","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/slidenl/recommended/441790/","slidenl","SLiDEnl","http://steamcommunity.com/id/slidenl/","78 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI got this game for free from the developers, as I had previously purchased the Repopulation. I wouldn't have bought this game if I hadn't gotten it for free because I, like most people, am sick to death of survival games.\n\nHowever this game seems to be quite different though I'm not sure why. I started playing this about 8 hours ago, not intending to play it for long, and somehow the whole day has gone by without me noticing.\n\nI enjoy exploring the world, I enjoy crafting all the different items this game has to offer (more housing items please!) I enjoy helping people as they seem quite friendly (PvE server that is).\n\nHowever on the negative side; I am constantly plagued by lagspikes, the interface needs a lot of work (I had my rifle equiped, I change over to the knife, but because my inventory was full it decided to fling the ♥♥♥♥♥ rifle halfway across the map never to be found again), items like houses etc cant be rotated moved or picked up once u've placed them down, just removed altogether. Little things.\n\nI'm very much looking forward to seeing where this game will grow from here, I've already clocked more hours on this than I ever did on the Repopulation. And giving this game away for free to those who bought the Repop, I feel is a masterstroke and unbelievably generous in this day and age, almost makes me believe in Early Access again (almost).\n\nAnd if you enjoy arbitrary numbers, I award a 7.5/10 to Fragmented.","April 28","true","11.1"," 30 of 39 people (77%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","77","30","39","3","1"
