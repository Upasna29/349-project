Where do I begin with this piece of crap. First things first, a key feature that is in every modern game is not there, an options menu. Without the ability to a just sound, resolution, and other normal options, this game is a pain as the music is way too loud. When you start a level, you have to click a button to begin loading, I sat there for 7 minutes thinking somthin was wrong with the game, I would understand if you had to begin the level, but to begin loading, and it doesnt help that the sound stops completely so you think the game is frozen. Then when you get into the level there is no tutorial what so ever, nothing that tells you what to do or how to do it. This wouldnt be a problem if there werent so many damn commads to give. All you d know is that there is enemy ships near by and you have to destroy them, thats it, thats all they tell you. The ships move in a stiff path that either curves way more than you wanted to or is to straight, attacks have bare minimum animation. Bottom line, this game sucks,  and the only thing that keeps me from giving it a 1/10 is the fact that is the Civil War, and I got it for 90% off ($  .99). Ironclads: American Civil War gets a 2/10, dont buy this game, it has no redeeming qualities.","July 17, 2013","false","0.5"," 31 of 40 people (78%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","78","31","40","3","0"

Don't buy it unless it is below $2.00. It's pretty bad. The gaphics are horrible. The gameplay was evan worse. It wouldn't let me finish my turn every now and then. I had to re-load the game over and over. There ais no way to change the controls or sound level. On the first level it just threw you in the game. It took me 2 hours to complete the first level. The only reason i kept playing was because I was determined to beat the first level. I read the other reviews and ignored them and thought, it's the Civil War it can't be that bad. I love to study the Confedercy and I am a proud Alabama patriot. The game overall was horrible. Just because it was the Civil War I would have to give it a 2/10. The game producers could have made it a really good game. If they had just made the first level on 20 turns at the maximum ,tried to fix the mechanics, and added buildings or forts to the game. I see what they where going for but they failed. (Although I did enjoy watching and moving my little ironclad and gunboats for about 10-15 minutes. Than I realized this game would last for a long, long time.)","June 26, 2014","false","4.6"," 28 of 40 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","28","40","0","1"

I believe this was the first one they issued.\n\nThe interface allows the ships to be separated into individual squadrons. While historically inaccurate, it renders the game much  more playable, plus helps illustrate just why ships of this era used the line tactics. Later games of this series only allow grouping the ships, and once a ship is heavily damaged, it (uncontrollably) breaks off. Whilst very realistic, also very frustrating (Hey! Iâm gonna go get sunk by running past the main battle group).\n\nThe projected path feature is really nice, and allows you fair control of the course.  The various armaments display when a shot is available, albeit for a split second sometimes. Pausing the ship motion is controlled by clicking icons on the display panel, and judicious use of saved games.\n\nThe data displayed and ship information is very detailed, and appears fairly accurate. The same applies to the ship names.  The models are very well done, and looks like a lot of work and research went into them. I canât believe other reviews complaining about lack of animated crew jumping about!  Really?\n\nOverall, I believe this is a fun game and enjoyed it.  This was a great work of programming and modelling. Other reviews need to cut Totem some slack â I donât see any Americans making anything like this. It very much reminds me of the Yaquinto boardgame Ironclads, with some similar elements of gameplay.\n\nRecommendations for the Totem staff:  apply this control interface to the later games in the series. It was very well done here. Also, muting the soundtrack would be nice. Ð¾ÑÐ»Ð¸ÑÐ½Ð°Ñ ÑÐ°Ð±Ð¾ÑÐ°!\n","February 5","true","60.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
