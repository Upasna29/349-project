Whoever thought that a really nice intro would make up for this mess of a game deserves a marketing Oscar. The ingame graphics look nothing like the art style used in the intro and the 10 second guitar riff will get on your nerves really quick. I should mention the really stupid puzzle design, but I guess it doesn't matter anyway.\n\nDon't even waste 3â‚¬ with a coupon like me.

The controls are incredibly unresponsive (and the tutorial was broken) and the way the enemies work is simply absurd - I could actually just WALK by them without really suffering any damage, at least at the beginning of the game. And if you do decide to fight them, you will notice that some of them do not really care for you, while others try to attack you so furiously that their animations almost break. Not a polished title, to say the least. Which is noticeable even more when you get stuck on a normal ground and have to jump over, well, nothing.\nThe game also does a terrible job when it comes to telling the player what he or she should do. While the giant green arrow points toward a boss, I had no idea I should drop of freakin' anchor on him. Sure, my character would say earlier that I should find someone to drop it on, but I did try to attack other enemies in this fashion and it didn't work. I'm still not sure what was the point of it. Cool concept, bad execution. And the difference between the difficulty levels is absurd - on normal, not having dropped the anchor, I hardly scratched the boss in a fight mano-a-mano. On easy - I shot it three times and bam, boss dead. Only after that I figured out I should have dropped the anchor on him. Needless to say I was confused. And still am.\nTo add insult to injury, although the game looks good, the world itself is ugly. Sure, it's a TOXIC, BAD bunny, so it has to look like that, but it's ugly nevertheless. Like one of those cartoons that are supposed to be "edgy" and aimed at "bad" kids who don't do their homework, and all the jokes revolve around barfing and farts. Which brings me to my next point - the humour. While the jokes in Toxic Bunny are not as crude as in the aforementioned example, they are a) scarce, b) have hardly anything to do with Looney Tunes or Monty Python (both are mentioned in the description, and both I adore).\nTo sum up, the game has clunky controls, looks ugly (though it is well drawn), and the humour - and the whole game - is simply bland. It is not really worth its price, especially since there are virtually billions of better (both modern and remakes) platformers. Unless you have played them all. Or you have always dreamed of a game about an unpleasant rabbit.","July 25, 2014","false","0.6"," 22 of 32 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","22","32","0","1"

The intro sequence runs at 15 FPS despite being an FMV, the default controls are godawful, the character controls extremely poorly even after you modify the controls to make sense, the art style is off-putting, the dialogue is painfully bad, the music is bland and uninspired at best and grating at worst (it is not possible to listen to the main menu music for any length of time),\n\nBut what made me stop playing was the tutorial. The game doesn't tell you what buttons to press to do anything and doesn't let you look at the controls unless you exit to the main menu, if any of the buttons work at all which they didn't my first time playing; I had to exit to the main menu and open the tutorial agan before the game arbitrarily decided to let me use the movement keys. Not to mention that it was extremely easy to render the tutorial outright unwinnable if you didn't know what controls did what; I ran into this twice, first when I killed the first enemy from a distance instead of walking inside his hitbox and using an item that killed both of us, second when I got to the shop and bought the first thing I was allowed to buy, only to find out that I was supposed to buy something else which was more expensive and now I didn't have enough money for it.\n\nWhen the game refuses to tell you what to do and becomes unwinnable if you don't know what to do during the tutorial, you do not have a playable game.","July 26, 2014","false","0.7"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/buttimedia/recommended/305010/","buttimedia","[G@mer]But terd","http://steamcommunity.com/id/buttimedia/","577 products in account","First try on Toxic Bunny HD\n\nUpdates will be posted boldly on the respecitve parts of the review.\nUpdate: After playing the game with a controller for a longer period, I change my opinion on the final verdict. Therefore the last paragraph has been changed.\n\nThe video is available here:\nhttp://youtu.be/K5mOC-wBvcE\n\nAs someone who loves plattformers, I thought I'd give this game a try, so I did just that and here are my first impressions.\n\nFirst off: The game is a HD remake, but it is not a case of just having its resulution upped. Sprites, backgrounds etc. were updated so it looks like a relatively modern title now.After taking a look at gameplay footage of the original game though, the animations, the physics, as well as the soundtrack are the exact same, as far as I can tell. You can call it staying true to the original or developer laziness...whatever you want to call it, I won't judge you.\n\nBefore we go into the game itself, we take a look at the options first, which provide us with fully rebindable controls. The audio options are fairly standard with seperate sliders for music, sound effects and ambient sounds. The graphics options are Unity standard: Low, Medium and High as well as standard resolutions are avaiable to chose.\n\nAnother thing I'd like to mention that, even though it is stated on the store page that this game has full controller support, I couldn't get my XBOX Controller to work with this game. So that is a big issue, at least for me, because I like to play plattformers with a controller better.\nUpdate: After using the guide of the devs (which you can find in the comments), I was able to make the controller work, which enhances the experience greatly, in my opinion.\n\nAs we get into the game the first thing many people will notice is that the way the momentum as well as the physics feel in that game is quite odd. So might take a little time getting used on the "oldschool" style of movement and momentum there. After playing the first level my experience with the combat is that is very shallow, which is good for new players, but it hurts the longevity of the game. Since it only  has 4 levels and I have been through the first level within 30 minutes it is safe to assume that the game lasts about 2-3 hours.\n\nIf you are an achievementhunter you might go back to some levels, but at this point I'd like to point out an issue which might take you your completionist enthusiasm. Sometimes, mostly when collecting a lot of stuff at once, it seems to me that the game is not recognizing you picking up items. Some items even take 3-4 attemps to count as collected, even though you've clearly hit it the tries before that.\n\nSpeaking of hitbox issues, the hitbox of walls as well as the ground when you try to shoot enemies takes a lot of getting used to.\n\nFor both issues you'll see examples in the video, I've made.\n\nAnother issue I've encountered is that I don't see what potion currently is active, which was the case when playing the tutorial. In the game itself it is not shown though. It seemed to me that the potion mechanic is not working properly, but this could be my mistake.\n\nOther than that I have to say that the potion mechanic sounds nice in theory and it's a shame, I couldn't see it in action.\n\n\nFinally the question of questions: Is the game worth it? At the current state, I say you can give it a shot, but keep in mind that the issues mentioned above make it hard for me to wholeheartedly recommend you this game.\nIf you feel the same way as I do, you might be better off buying it at a sale.","July 20, 2014","true","1.6"," 18 of 34 people (53%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","53","18","34","3","5"

Give it a try if you get it on the (very) cheap or as a gift, but do not overspend on what is essentially an unpolished game that wasted its potential.","June 12, 2015","false","4.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

But Iâ€™ve been told that others have liked playing it and at least some are quite fond of it.\n\nPersonally I had a bit of trouble figuring out the controls at the start. Itâ€™s a little bit more than just move, jump and attack. You also need to know the buttons to use and scroll through your inventory and potions. Take a look at the key-bindings in the main menu before starting the game and this shouldnâ€™t be an issue for you (it was my fault for not going back and looking for that at the start).\n\nEnemies take a lot more shots from your weapon than Iâ€™m used to compared other games. So I just ran past most of them lol\n\nManeuvouring and platforming can be a bit tricky and might take some getting used to. Taking your finger off the shift button (sprint) when you need to more finely control your rabbit might help in some situations. (edit: after writing this I booted up the game and in the loading screen it said 'learn to jump, it is critical' lol)\n\nSo yeah, give it ago you might like.

The controls are horrible. Controller support is terrible as well, as you can bind buttons in the configuration area, and then not even have them mapped correctly once you're in game. Analog stick support is bad as well, as the controls seem to get stuck in one direction. This does not happen in any other game, so I do not believe this is a problem with my xbox controller.\nWeapons do not function well, and the movement of your character only exacerbates that. The movement is very stiff, and non fluid. Your character awkwardly moves from position to position, and if this is a problem with vsync, well the options menu give you no option to turn that on or off. In fact, the graphics controls consist of low/medium/high, and only a choice of resolution.\nThis game is not well done by any stretch, even the graphics are poor. By the way, an endlessly looping musical track that might be 6 seconds long?\n\nStay away, stay VERY far away. There is nothing redeemable about this game. It reminded me of early 90s PC platformers, but even those were better made than this. Says $6 for this.
