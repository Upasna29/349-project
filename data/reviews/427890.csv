The atmosphere at the beginning when you're in the house is great. The mini-games are fun and offer decent replay value to get good at them. Yes the game is a bit short and shallow for what it offers but the game is also priced pretty fair for what it offers.\n\nThis would be a good family game for the local co-op, and I think its a pretty good first VR game to show people as the environments are nice and the mini games are easy to understand.\n\nI would LOVE if they kept adding onto this with the same atmosphere and art style","April 9","true","0.2"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Found this game great to play with friends who are just introduced to VR! I wouldn't play this game single player as there are only 4 minigames but as a party game for the price its definately worth it!","April 28","true","1.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The mini games are a lot of fun and the feeling of performing for an audience is great.  Make sure to enable the audience booing from the TV menu in the living room area. The added pressure is amazing","April 6","true","3.0"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/crumbly89/recommended/427890/","crumbly89","Mulder","http://steamcommunity.com/id/crumbly89/","472 products in account","Game play is fun, but a bit shallow. Only four real mini games here, but done in a creative environment that's a joy to look at.  The games are easy to play, but can be tough to master (or i'm just not meant for  the carnie life?). Over all at the current price, it's a good game to get if you planned on doing some local coop, as that's where it would really be best, but with only the four games here, I don't know how often I'll play it single player. Recommending anyway because it's good for a laugh and does offer replay value, and was designed well.","April 7","true","0.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

And the devs even seem to be still actively developing this.\n\nCan't do wrong with this one if you have a Vive!","May 2","true","1.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/omgtehawsome/recommended/427890/","omgtehawsome","Alvaro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/omgtehawsome/","1406 products in account","The amount of content (4 minigames) is really pretty thin in general, though not really unfair at this price. Most importantly, though, the physics are really, really wonky. Nothing feels quite right, and considering that it's a skill-based game it ruins the core mechanic. You'll lob a ball and it'll just fall onto the ground in front of you, possibly landing just out reach and breaking the game. As it stands I can't see myself demoing this to anyone and certainly not playing it myself.\nIt does have potential, though. Add a few (and I mean few, like two) more games and fix the physics and this would easily jump into my demo rotation.","May 10","false","0.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The controls aren't that intuitive and it didn't keep my interest for more than a few minutes. You can also lose important objects in the game that make some of the mini games unplayable without restarting them. The art style is kind of cute and unique, which adds a certain charm to the game, but at it's current stage I can't really recommed it. Maybe if it was a free demo for a more developed game, but as a full product I can't justify it.","April 9","false","0.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"
