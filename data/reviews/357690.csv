As a casual gamer you may find that most of the levels are easy until you get to that one level which requires an impossible jump.  An hour later you might get lucky and start patting yourself on the back for that silver/gold medal you finally claimed; and on you go to the next level.  However, if you do decide to retry for diamond, you have to be extremely precise, and perhaps gravity-defying.  For those who want to compete, this is a fun game to play.\nThe game is not without its flaws, but I am confident that the developers are going to fix them very soon.  For nearly two hours after installation the game performed horribly at 1920x1080 on an i7-3770k and Radeon HD 6870 (even with all settings on low).  By modding the assets of the game and removing a couple materials the game instantly became playable again.  As it stands I am convinced there there are some necessary optimizations that need to be done, because removing the materials is only a short-term solution and also subtracts from the game's polish.  If you have a more powerful rig than me, then you probably won't have any graphical lag.\nAnother issue I have with this game is the camera shake.  Almost anytime you perform an action the camera will shake violently which makes it very hard to land precise shots while rocket jumping.  I have a hard time keeping my mouse still while under pressure and the camera shake only makes it worse.\nAll that being said, this game is pretty hardcore (and fun).","August 28, 2015","true","9.5"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

Both of these actions require a small cool-down in between uses, which forces you to perfect your timing. You've also got another action, with which you can press distant buttons in order to activate objects like platforms.\n\nThe game has a good replay value due to the medal ranking system, which will most likely tempt some people to retry and perfect certain levels. There's a good variety of levels with different types of skills needed, which keeps the game fresh.\n\nOverall, I think the game is quite fun if you're into this genre!","September 5, 2015","true","9.2"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","9","12","2","0"

I mean if the game relies on aiming and jumping to test the player skill then said player should be allowed to aim as good as he can right? The aim problem is further compounded by the autoaim of the grapple. Yes, you read it right. In a game that tests aiming skill you have autoaim (besides the random aim described earlier)...\nThen there is the platforming: jumpjets and being able to airwalk should make platforming a pleasure. But no! The walls have almost no texture which makes it very difficult to get an idea of the direction you go in mid air. You see the same color metalilc wall and is difficult to say in which way the character goes. It is thus very difficult to execute the precision jumping required by the game.\nIf the developers read the reviews:\n- please eliminate the screen tremble when activating jump jets\n- eliminate (or give an option to eliminate) the autoaim of grapple\n- offer much more visual clues to indicate the mid air speed of the player (simplest way to do this is to texture the walls and place some doodads in the rooms)","December 24, 2015","false","3.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","4"

This is WAY more difficult than Portal, and takes things a step beyond.

Can be a bit annoying to aim mid-air.\n- Story is lackluster, though the focus is on the gameplay.\n\nSummary/ Tl;dr\nIt's really fun to fling yourself through the air, and there are challenging parts that definitely make it skill-based.

Also like Portal, APT's deceptively simple mechanics unfold to reveal a real depth of gameplay hidden within just a few straightforward actions. Coupled with the visual minimalism, the core simplicity of this game is the perfect setting to showcase the punishingly well-crafted level design.\n\nUnlike Portal, the difficulty in this game is the kind that requires quick reflexes, adroit handling of the controls, and a quick, intuitive sense of the physics in order to do well. It's not the kind of thing that will appeal to everyone, but for many -- myself included -- the merciless, impersonal taunting of a tightly-tuned ranking system is the kind of thing that engenders a genuine sense of satisfaction when you finally shave a few thousandths of a second off your best time to eke out diamond rank on a particularly challenging stage, hours later.","October 14, 2015","true","8.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/KitchenKoala/recommended/357690/","KitchenKoala","KitchenKoala","http://steamcommunity.com/id/KitchenKoala/","115 products in account","I fell in love with this game immediately after playing a demo at the 2015 SXSW Gaming Expo. While it does resemble Portal at first glance, its gameplay is more reminiscient of games like Super Meat Boy where precision and timing are everything. The game teaches you the basics and then leaves you to figure out more complex manuevers as you play. The ranking system amplifies this as certain ranks can only be achieved through specific paths and more complex moves (See the Gold vs Diamond video above).\n\nAt the moment, there are 29 levels, not including the tutorial and the several bonus challenges like the Creator's Challenge. There is a checkpoint system if you desire and after the tutorial cutscenes, there is very little downtime, leaving you to focus on perfecting your runs for that elusive Diamond ranking. All in all, this is a game for people who enjoy a fast-paced, challenging, first-person 3D puzzle platformer that allows them to get in quickly and game.","October 17, 2015","true","13.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/novaphyer/recommended/357690/","novaphyer","Novaphyer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/novaphyer/","49 products in account","APT is a Portal-like aesthetically looking game where you solve puzzles in a closed set of room(s), but instead of a Portal gun, you have Jets, Tethers and Switches. If you thought Portal wasn't a very challenging game, APT will be right up your alley, Portal's level design focused more on figuring out where to go and what to do, while APT is more about fundimentals and execution, and still finding out what to do.  So this game is for the bit more hardcore puzzle platformer than others. Each Level/Trial has it's own little puzzle that can be solved in most cases, more than 1 way. The game keeps a good balance between really hard levels to easy ones, sometimes you'll come across a really hard level that might take you an hour to get Diamond or top score in, while the next couple preceding it only take 5-10 minutes doing the same. There is a ton of satisfication to beating the trials and getting that Diamond Rank and that's where it gets addicting.\n\nSo to Sum it up, It's like Portal but harder, Level design is on point, and if you're really into being the best at this game you'll easily get your mone back on this purchase.\n\nIf you want to see how to get Diamond in all Trials, check out the Video I made, each trial has gottten a Diamond Rank\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=513519849\n","September 6, 2015","true","19.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Unfortunately once i purchased and played the game for the first few tutorial levels i discovered that the minimalistic design, while maybe an aesthetic decision, was also an indication of what i feel to be an unfinished product.  the gameplay was very clunky and the "tether" hit registration was very poor.  to the point where you can watch a video of someone completing a level, then replicate those steps but have something randomly not "connect" with no indication as to why (shot to high, to low, not close enough, ect...) due to the game offering very little in the way of objects to use as a reference for depth perception.

That's it. Nothing more, nothing less.\n\nThe game feels like a solidly finished, 3D platforming framework for somebody to fill in with substance, except somebody forgot to expose the API. Whoops.\n\n\n\nNow for the longform:\n\nIt's my fault for making assumptions. For some reason, maybe the people mentioning Portal when talking about the game, I just figured there'd be a little more to it once you got going a bit. You know, some sort of further interaction between the character and the disembodied voice of the researcher that initializes them, or maybe a backstory. A plot thing to keep me interested.\n\nTo be honest, this game was kind of an impulse buy for me because I liked how shiny it was and I wanted to listen to the music and see the rooms designs, what have you. Plus it was on sale.\n\nMy experience so far has been that the chambers, and therefore the game itself, are little more than a novelty. They're 3D obstacle courses with fancy mechanics (and some not so fancy, like basic platforms) that have you racing against the clock to figure out how the chamber works.\n\nThese chambers are indeed quite challenging as you progress. It's mostly because the basic physics of the game itself are just so particular, which is good. However once a chamber's novelty wears off, they just grow tiresome due to the long, unforgiving chains of rapidfire maneuvers required to complete most chambers. That means that when I screw up I have to start all over again in chambers that just seem to keep getting longer and longer. It's just arbitrarily time-consuming, and that leads me to the real problem.\n\nThe problem is that the devs dangle no carrots to keep me on the hamster wheel. There's no cheese at the end of the tunnel.\n\nI get virtually no satisfaction from completing a chamber other than being glad that I've finally gotten it out of the way. All of the chambers are just disconnected rooms with no purpose or structure, no story.\n\nAs shiny as the game is, there isn't even anything pretty to look at due to their choice of visual aesthetics. (All the chambers look exactly the same as you see in the trailer.) I'm not progressing toward any sort of goals other than to complete the entire list of chambers, but I'm so bored now that I don't even have enough curiosity left to manage that. Scoring diamond on the leaderboards may mean a lot to some people, but I don't personally give a damn.\n\nIf you want a better game of the same type, I highly recommend DeadCore instead. Sadly it's not nearly as shiny, but it's a much more engaging experience overall. Not to mention it's cheaper and includes dank memes.","March 18","false","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
