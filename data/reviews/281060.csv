"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/281060/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","The first chapter of Reversion was a mildly entertaining, if rather exceedingly traditional point and click adventure game with the undeniable benefit of being entirely free. Chapter two, "The Meeting", now carries with it a price tag but also comes along with rather significantly less charm, cascading the first's amusing silliness for a melodramatic plot full of outrageous performances and exposition with any movement.\n\nFrom start to finish The Meeting accomplishes almost nothing in advancing Reversion's plot, spending most of its time forcing you to solve inscrutable puzzles typically only difficult in so far as the clunky interface is proficient at making simple tasks intuitive and buried within interaction menus. I was leaning on a guide for much of the hour or so long chapter, as the in game hint system is fairly useless, and everytime I reached for a better walkthrough I was met with a terribly simple solution which usually involved clicking on an object more than I had reason to believe I ought to.\n\nAmid the tedious fiddling with each and every random item The Meeting is stuffed full of agonizingly tone deaf performances of the abysmal dialogue, which would be almost delightful in its mediocrity if it wasn't so intent on being absolutely serious, outside of some groan inducing attempts at humor. Characters are practically caricatures of caricatures, with no personality outside of their cliched roles and grating voices, with nothing to say save a continual chorus of "there's no time to explain."\n\nI'm not sure exactly what happened between chapter one and two. Maybe it's been too long and I didn't enjoy the first as much as I thought I did, or perhaps I simply expected more from the sequel as it was no longer this random novelty but actually trying to create a full season length experience. Whatever the case "The Meeting" was an unexpectedly dreadful followup to something that seemed if not promising, than at least a potentially enjoyable diversion, but which I now cannot see myself coming back to regardless of whether or not chapter three ever shows itself.","January 4, 2015","false","1.6"," 26 of 30 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","26","30","0","1"

So you have just escaped the hospital and are now on your way to meet up with someone who might know about the mysterious man that is in a picture that happens to be on your person. Now of course you can't get a straight answer without a little bit of help in return. So this episode is basically all about finding out about the gentleman in the picture.\n\nGraphically is the same game, so I can't say that there's any difference. Now that's not a bad thing, it means that they didn't go off the reservation and try to re-invent the wheel. Yet again you are going to be introduced to an assortment of characters which all look unique and really fit the parts that they will be playing in this game.\n\nSadly the voice acting does not get any better, its still almost robotic, there's no real emotion in the the characters. It almost feels like they are all so full on mood inhibitors that the only thing they can do is just tell you what is going on, but deadpan.\n\nThe controls are the same as well, and that of course, once again is a good thing.\n\nAlright so in this chapter, in which you have to put money down to play, you will be running around doing puzzles, and solving a couple of mysteries. You will get to see a college, a subway, a grave yard, a broken down building, a ransacked house, and you will get the chance to revisit the hospital. Once again there will be a good balance of combining objects and puzzle solving involved to complete this chapter.\n\nNow I know there are a lot of you out there who want me to cut to the chase and tell you is it worth the money to play the next chapter. Well here's the deal, even though the developers are charging you for this chapter the game length does not increase, well I think it increased by a whole 4 or 5 minutes. Honestly I was really disappointed in seeing this. I now understand that the chapters are indicators of when the episode will end. In the first one you escape, end of chapter. In the second one you are building up to a meeting, and of course as soon as that happens, end of chapter. This game looks too good, and feels like there is so much more there to be SO short when it comes to game play, but sadly that's what it appears that the developers are doing. Here's hoping that the next chapter has a couple of big moments that will allow a player to really get emerged into the world before closing the chapter. With that being said I have to give this chapter an even lower score and put it at a 5.6 out of 10. I hate to do it, but when you put a price tag on a game, people expect more, especially if you gave the first chapter away for free.","August 1, 2014","false","0.9"," 19 of 26 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","19","26","0","0"

Science fiction combined with the said post-apocalyptic setting and made a little bit funny - that's quite an original approach.\n* Classic adventure gameplay: many items in your inventory, including a lot of red herrings.\n\nCons:\n* For me. there is only one serious shortcoming, and It could be repeated many times: the game is just too short, unfortunately. Even combined with the free Chapter 1, it could be played through in about half an hour. Well, there is still a hope that more chapters will come soon, and as a whole it would be much more lengthy.","July 10, 2014","true","4.0"," 20 of 28 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","20","28","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cerebralpulse/recommended/281060/","cerebralpulse","Mio","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cerebralpulse/","3110 products in account","[Taken straight from my Desura review]\nNice little indie point-and-click game. TL/DR? Skip to my conclusion at the end.\n\nFirst, I have to say I like experiencing foreign language/culture in games and movies, so for me I was interested to see how this played out in this and the 1st Chapter (which I played back to back). After finishing the two games, the setting of Buenos Aires did play a small part, with all the Spanish signs and stuff.\n\nThe graphics are clean and interaction wasn't too bad. Load times are good, and there is no major waiting between screens. One thing I didn't like however was that the movement is too slow - i.e. when crossing a room - you can double click on the other side of the room to speed things up, but if you don't click in the right place, you either don't get the guy to cross any quicker, or you inadvertently move to the next room or screen.\n\nThe background music was well done and nice, while not imposing on the dialogue. The English voice acting was acceptable, although Victoria's tone seemed a little weird, like the actor who voiced her didn't speak English as their first language. All the other voice acting seemed fine though.\n\nI guess my biggest gripe about this game is it's length. There is quite a bit of clicking through dialogue, but it still only took me about 3 1/2 hours to play the whole game (BOTH chapters). The second biggest gripe is it's left on a bit of a cliffhanger - will there be another chapter? If not, I'm pretty disappointed with the ending; yes there are a few questions answered, but there are far too many left unanswered. Chapter 2 has been out for over a year now, I really hope we have another chapter to really finish things properly.\n\nIn conclusion, a pretty good game for what appears to be a small devteam, I just would have wanted to see more. Good value? Hmm, well I did like it, I am just disappointed there wasn't more game time - I usually estimate $1 per hour of gameplay, and this didn't deliver that (based on the full price). Maybe Chapter 3 will change my mind on that...","July 16, 2014","true","4.0"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

What makes it worse though is the fact its poor UI has the potential to make you go on a wild goose chase to solve this episode's puzzles. To cap it all off, you're expected to pay money for this episode for a pretty average experience when you could play the first episode for free. If you're curious about the game, make sure you try the free first episode before deciding to buy the second.

Said puzzles are a minor step down from the previous, free chapter though and a few are a bit on the obscure side, but overall I enjoyed puzzling myself through the game. And where the story was mostly absent in the previous installment it starts going places in this chapter. Enough so that I'm looking forward to seeing what comes next.\n\nReversion - The Meeting is not without its issues though. The animation is still a bit awkward at times and I could have wished for some more depth in the character models. The English version is also a bit strange and obviously translated by a non-native speaker. Some might also find it a bit short for the price, and especially so because it's only one part of a series. The first chapter is free though and if an upgrade option to the whole game from this chapter is offered once the next chapter is out, I'm satisfied.","July 19, 2014","true","2.7"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

This time the player had to travel between locations and had a lot more puzzles to work out. By this point of the story the cast of charcters is now building up with new introductions. If you enjoyed part one then you'll love part two. We hit a cliff hanging climax which all fans love to see. A personal favourite of mine is the music, especially the games main theme. It had been a week since I last played "The escape" and I was waiting till I had money until I bought part two (obvioulsy) I downloaded "The meeting," loaded it up and was greeted with the awesome theme. I had a grin from ear to ear. Reversion - The meeting is a really nice allround game, puzzles keep you thinking and the story keeps you hooked. There is one problem though. There's a problem with the achievement you gain for beating the game in under four hours. The game needs patched, it doesn't effect you enjoying the game which is a good thing.

This is more of the same.  It's a very simple game to proceed through, with some simple discovery and problem solving.

Definitely worth the money in that situation, but if someone paid $5.99 I think they would be unhappy.\n\nThere are some glitches in the translation from Spanish to English, but for an indie, that does not bother me much.

For anyone who has been there, it's quite chilling to see lots of the locations normally buzzing with people to be derelict and overgrown in the game. I can't wait to see what locations appear next, although the Recoleta cemetery would make a great little maze section so holding out hope for that.\n\nFor those looking to play with the original Spanish voices and English subtitles, you can delete xvoices_en.dcp from the game folder.

Μπορεί να μη διεκδικεί δάφνες πρωτοτυπίας, βραβεία γρίφων και διάρκειας, ούτε και να καταφέρνει να δείξει μέχρι στιγμής ότι είναι σε θέση να μείνει αξέχαστο σε κάποιον, αλλά είναι σίγουρα ένας καλοφτιαγμένος και ευχάριστος τίτλος, προσεγμένος σε όλους τους τεχνικούς τομείς του και γενικά είναι ικανό να κάνει οποιονδήποτε ασχοληθεί μαζί του να περάσει ευχάριστα κάποιες ώρες.\nΑν τα στελέχη της πρωτοεμφανιζόμενης 3f Interactive καταφέρουν να προσδώσουν πλουσιότερη διάρκεια και πιο υψηλό δείκτη δυσκολίας στο τρίτο μέρος, διατηρώντας τη χαμηλή τιμή έκαστου εξ’ αυτών, νομίζω ότι η δημιουργία τους έχει όλα τα φόντα να εξελιχθεί σε ένα πολύ αξιόλογο adventure game και μάλιστα από μία χώρα που, πλην του ταλαντούχου Agustin Cordes, δεν είχε την παραμικρή παράδοση μέχρι σήμερα στο χώρο.\n\nReversion has been a really pleasant surprise. It does not present much originality, it cannot earn a prize for its puzzles or its length, but it’s a neat, pleasant game, with well-cared technical aspects, capable of offering joy to whoever decides to spend some hours with it.\nIf 3f Interactive manages to make the next chapter longer and more difficult, Reversion has all the potential of developing into a very nice game in whole, coming from a country that, except for Agustin Cordes, hasn’t the slightest tradition in adventure games creation.\n\nhttp://www.ragequit.gr/reviews/item/reversion-the-escape-the-meeting-pc-review","December 4, 2014","true","0.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

In the part with the car if you take the car battery then he spelled it "batery" in the subtitles. Also in pablo's hideout when you use the U.V. light he says that the word starts with an a S and all I see is a giant ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ F as the first letter, its not even close to S. Also the movement animations are so freaking dumb its hilarious. When the chubby soldier unrealistically moves while holding his ♥♥♥♥, when the maria chick runs and when you mass click an object your character has a spaz attack XD. Over all like in the last game I liked the art, the background and I like how it has some historical aspects to it. But the dialogue, by that I mean the voice acting sucked, other than the main character, they messed up on trying to sound emotional and just made it kinda awkward. I would rate 7/10 just because how hilarious this game was but also the developer needs to fix the steam/pause glitch. I was curious if some of the information he used in the game was accurate so I paused the game and went into a steam window and when I came out of it my cursor would not appear. I couldnt even select anything when I got into the game, all I could do was save and restart and that didnt even work. I almost beat the game and the only save I had was the glitched out one, so I had to restart all over again and finish the game. All together it was a pretty good game glitchy as hell, but freaking hilarious.","December 13, 2015","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is the second instalment in the Reversion series, with Reversion - The Escape being the first. The graphics and UI are the exact same as the first one.\n\nPros-Good storyline\n-Steam trading cards\n-Easy-to-get achievements\n-Any computer can run this game\n\nCons-Lots of spelling errors\n-Voice acting could be better\n-Too short, just like the first one\n-A bit too expensive for a game that is relatively short\n-Encountered a bug where I got stuck when I entered an area and I was unable to click on anything\n\nIt took me 2.5 hours to complete my first playthrough of this game. Do take note that I took my time scrutinising the environment and from time to time, I was afk while the game was still running. Despite having flaws, it's still a fun game regardless but I recommend purchasing this game while it's on sale.\n\nFINAL RATING: 6/10","January 4","true","3.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/l4ll3/recommended/281060/","l4ll3","lalle","http://steamcommunity.com/id/l4ll3/","304 products in account","Super short and super easy game. I played through it twice. First time very camly clicking everything to try to get submerged into the story, didn't work very well. The second time to get all the achievements, after getting 100% of the achievements I only have 2/4 cards (No walkthrough or similar used). 2 cards are yet to drop and there's nothing more to do in the game.\n\nThey game is just way too easy, I never happens that you need to stop and think. This game should not be in episodes, it should be one game with all of them, and the price should be what one of the episodes costs, the combined price makes it superexpensive for the little you get.\n\nThe female voice actor (english version) is one of the worst I've heared, obviously just some person reading a paper from top to bottom. Might replay it spanish some day to see if it's better since I still have 2 cards to drop...\n\nEdit: Came back to the game, wanted to do a play though in spanish to see if it was better. Turns out that chaning the language to spanish does, NOTHING. everything is still in english, voice actors, menu's etc everything. Validating files, deleting, reinstalling doesn't help, everything still in english even though spanish exists in the language menu and is chosen... both thumbs down!","March 13","false","3.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
