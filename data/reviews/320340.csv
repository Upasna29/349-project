So I advise you to read further before downvoting or thinking the game is bad.\n\nFor an Early Access title, it's a very well polished product. The graphics are good, the interface is nice, and the audio is great, and there's few bugs.\nHowever, even though the game is well made and has good potential if further developed, its current core gameplay is repetitive and not really fun. Which is exactly why I can't recommend it: it's not a matter of specific, isolated issues. The CORE of the game feels pointless at this time.\n\nCOMBAT: Battles are EXTREMELY slow, repetitive, unsatisfying and not rewarding as one might think. I'm sad to say it's the worst pacing and balancing I've experienced from this sort of FTL-insipired games. It feels like Sid Meyer's Pirates in space (which is good and could be a lot of fun) with a slight touch of FTL.\nEven after I got the most expensive combat ship, and decent skill on battles, it still felt wrong, and kind of boring. Enemies may surrender and offer you a good amount for their lives, however, which is a great thing to see when it works - very few games I played have such feature.\n\nTRADING: The game doesn't provide enough info to make sense of the economy. And even though it follows a basic supply/demand and consumption/production cycle, there's no influence in the game universe beyond that. Trading is a simple mindless grind, which wouldn't be that big of a deal if it could be automated. And once you figure out a good run, you can have everyhing in the game after some mindless hauling that shouldn't take more than a couple of hours.\n\nThose are the two core aspects of the game, and both feels shallow - which is weird, because the presentation of the game is amazing. However, all the systems are in place, and both Combat and Trading can be further expanded, balanced or fixed, because the design isn't FUBAR. So there IS hope for Cosmonautica.\n\nI did enjoy the research feature and how it's implemented - In my opinion, it's a pretty unique system. And the semi-realistic "orbital" flight is a fresh take on space flight in games.\nAssembling your crew is cool, and watching they develop is great.\nBuilding your rooms to tailor your ship to your playstyle feels great, too. Being able to change ship and uniform colors is also a nice touch.\nThe comedy undertone and popular references are fun to have.\n\nSo it REALLY boils down to the core gameplay - which was an unpleasant surprise after I got used to the whole interface, systems and setting.\n\nIf you are looking for a very simple trading game that can be played only with the mouse, go ahead. But anything more than that, and I can't guarantee it'll meet your expectations at the moment.\nI really hope the devs expand and focus on the core gameplay before the actual release. Cosmonautica was on my wishlist for a long while, and just because I don't recommend it RIGHT NOW, doesn't mean I won't change my opinion later.\n\nWith proper depth, more focus os the core gameplay and a bit more complexity, Cosmonautica can be one of the gems of Steam. Otherwise, it'll definitely fall short, with the only positive point being that "it only costs 15 USD"..so my final advice is: wait before buying.\n\nThanks for reading!","July 22, 2015","false","12.0"," 437 of 491 people (89%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","89","437","491","4","21"

Unfortunately this then leads to items being stuck in your cargohold which you have purchased but then can't find anywhere in the system that will buy them.\n\nLevelling up your crew members is iffy. At the point of level up you are granted a skill point to increase that crew members abilities. However there is no cancel button on the level up screen so if you, like me, wonder what the unlock buttons do on the level up screen and click them, you'll find it opens up a new skill set. Again unfortunately, once you've found that out and decide you don't want them to start a new skill set and you just want them to improve in their current job you find you can't, as there is no cancel button and you have to accept.\n\nWhich leads on to the save system. Apparently it was a "design decision" to not allow the player to save their game. Instead there are autosaves only. This would be fine in some types of game, perhaps even in this one if it was polished. There are too many instances in this game where I've lost time and effort through bugs which could be easily avoided by having a save point to return to.\n\nI would say this game possibly has potential depending on how much work the developer still plans to put into this product. Though at the moment it's a disappointing experience.","September 19, 2015","false","6.7"," 121 of 138 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","121","138","2","0"

It's very significant that although at this stage, the game does crash about once an hour, I don't seem to mind (and this usually causes me to rant).\n\nCosmonautica is a cute, humourous game where you manage your (at the start, very shoddy) spaceship and crew. There's trading, smugglin, passenger transportation and fighting. You can upgrade your ship's rooms by installing a science module and hiring a scientist.\n\nThe trading takes a while to get used to, but after a bit of practice it's possible to make a profit margin. However, this wll not be sufficient to amass a fortune: i find that at the start it's best to concentrate on a combination of trading and passenger transportation to make a living. Fighting is best left to a little later, as your starting ship and crew aren't worth much in a fight yet :)\n\nAll in all, a very very nice game, with the potential to be a great game if the developpers keep adding features, missions and new upgrades for your ship. (Maybe even ground 'away' missions?)\n\nPROS:\n- Nice cartoony graphics\n- Funny, without ever becoming obnoxious\n- Good balance between trading/fighting/transportation...\n- Some learning curve at the start but not too hard after a few hours' practice\n- Very addictive as you want to keep improving your ship, crew and fortune\n\nCONS:\n- Occasional 'freeze' crashes (the game litterally just left early access so I imagine they will fix this soon)\n- The fights do feel a bit 'light'\n\nWISHLIST:\nI feel the game could be really great but just needs to be 'fleshed out' some. So for what it's worth, here's my wishlist :)\n- FIx the 'freeze' crash issues\n- Make some more variation for the crew (both graphical and in personality complexity, backstory etc...)\n- Flesh the fights out some more: these feel a bit 'light', no real sense of danger or damage (some sound changes and a slight speed up of pace perhaps?)\n- More and more diverse missions available on space stations - possibly even longer missions requiring more steps\n- 'Away' missions on planetary surfaces.\n\nAnyway, I heartily recommend this game to lovers of Sid Meier's Pirates, the Hitch Hiker's Guide or Firefly!\n\nFIND A CREW - FIND A JOB - KEEP FLYING  ;)","August 3, 2015","true","34.9"," 123 of 145 people (85%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","85","123","145","4","1"

Was looking forward to building my ship and crew up for master smuggling and later try out being combative but unfortunately I have crashed three times in the last hour. It looks like they've put some improvements into the game, but if I can't play it steadily then it's a bit hard to get excited.\n\nUpdate 1 Sept 2015: I have been told by a developer that patches are incoming to address some of these complaints. I will update my review when I play with the fixes in place, but I still recommend holding off purchasing until the big patches have gone through.\n\nOriginal Review: I love the art style and personality of the game, but it's fairly shallow and repetitive. Combat seems pretty broken as even on the easiest combat mission I ran out of ammo far before I could really damage my foe's shields and was able to flee all other encounters easily. This basically removes a third of the missions, a crew member, and a decent amount of ship upgrades. I was excited to see more galaxies to explore but once I got there it was the exact same missions and goods to trade, so I'm not really sure what the point is in exploring and researching deeper into space. Then there's the FTL-comparison part where you can control crew members as they go about their tasks on the ship. I had no real need to do this at any point as I rarely took damage and basically only occasionally told my cleaner to fix up the bathroom.\n\nThe game definitely needs some more depth and balance before I can recommend it. It's too bad because the visuals are wonderful, but it's really lacking in gameplay variety.","August 5, 2015","false","12.2"," 84 of 101 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","84","101","0","2"

It was always "almost-there."\n\nIt was your classic steam-experience of an early access getting pushed too early.\n\nWhile it's most definitely fun for the time I played it, and it has a -massive- amount of potential; it feels overall unrealized.\n\nWhat is new and exciting at first quickly becomes the norm when you realize all the NPC's are virtually the same with relatively pointless interactions.  You can choose your own dialogue choices for instance, but it makes no measurable effect on the game.  The stations are all the same, minus some commodities and services.  The same could be said for the solar systems and the various AI ships roaming about.\n\nThey sort of alude to a morality system, (juxtaposing being a trader vs. a pirate) but that doesn't seem to be there.  There's just not much filler here.  This game is a fondant cake, it looks good but it tastes bad.\n\nGenerally it's okay, I would give it a solid 5/10 or 2/5.  Playable, but definitely passable.","December 4, 2015","false","11.7"," 49 of 53 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","49","53","2","0"

There are lots of positives here but not enough currently to keep my interest. Here are a few headlines if you're on the fence:\n\nPRO'S\n\nDecent crossover of SIMS/Space Trader.\nA reasonable amount of ships to save up for.\nLots of star systems to explore, though this isn't really encouraged as much as it could be in the story mode.\nGraphics are cartoony and bright.\nMissions are fairly varied.\n\nCON'S\n\nLots of crashes - even after 'finished' release.\nAs mentioned in other reviews - economy is fairly static and doesn't always make sense. A planet that exports robots only has 10 tons at any given time? How is that an export system?\nLots of bugs - trade bugs will regularly put you into a negative balance. Mission text doesn't always reflect mission outcomes,\nCombat - DULL, DULL, DULL. No speed up option, most fights end up in either a stalemate or are a simple matter of 'Charge all guns blazing'.\nSIMS element is underplayed - characters don't really interact enough.\nTrading is incredibly tedious - see above on static economy. So I bought a ship with 80 units of space but the market only has 4 units of what I need? And it only regenerates at 2 units per 2 days? EXCELLENT.\nAutosave feature means that if something goes badly wrong (see negative cash balance bugs) then you are completely scuppered.\nSome grammatical errors and generally unpolished text entries.\n\nIt's a shame - the game tries to shine in two genres but doesn't really take off in either. Hopefully this game will get more patches and content as it goes along - for now I would only pick this up if you want to grab it while its on sale and you don't mind learning the ropes of an unfinished game that has a lot of potential.\n\n- DG.","September 28, 2015","false","23.0"," 43 of 47 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","43","47","0","0"

Like "FTL", you can obtain crew members and assign them tasks.  When you're not watching your crew members go about their daily lives, you'll be traveling, trading, and ruining someone's day a-la "Freelancer".  The art style and humor reminded me a bit of "Redshirt" in that it seemed cartoony and light-hearted.  In addition to a campaign (not yet available), players will be able to procedurally generate a galaxy via a sandbox mode.  My experience was rather limited due to the problems I had with the early build I played, but I'd give it a "thumbs up" for the potential alone.  I, of course, reserve the right to change my opinion in the near and immediate future as the game is still under development.  The game will launch at the retail price of $14.99, but you can grab it on Steam's Early Access program for $9.99.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDzAtfb505o\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9JgeXnkzdA","September 17, 2014","true","9.8"," 50 of 62 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","50","62","0","0"

The graphics and animation quality is very impressive, and I like the design work very much. Buying resources, travelling and reselling them for a profit feels good. Ontop of that, there are missions on every planet, e.g. to transport people to a certain planet. However, the variety among these missions is extremely limited. It feels like they are always the same ~10 missions, no matter which planet.\n\nI also do not quite understand the point of the additional solar systems one can travel to. They have certain shifts in the distribution of resources you can buy and sell, but offer nothing new at all otherwise. The quests are the same, the goods are essentially the same as well.\n\nAlso, I got through my games - so far - without requiring any weapons what so ever. I think forcing the player to aquire some weapons as defense would be a good idea, i.e. by throwing the player into combat every now and then. This happened for me once, but i could easily flee without any repercussions. This is a shame, because forcing more combat on the player could be a way of disturbing them from the much more efficient strategy of peacefully buying and reselling expensive goods.\n\nThere are still a good number of bugs, too. From missing planet names in the main scenario mission descriptions to a straight up crash (happened once, and was mitigated by the apparently very regular autosaving).\n\nI only had 2 different ships, I never did any hacking, I avoided combat without any problem. And still, I do not feel too much incentive in going those routes either, because I don't expect to find anything new.\n\nSid Meier's Pirates created depth through Diplomatic relationships, progression of the main character (becoming the best pirate, avenging your family), and showed variety through a number of minigames. Both variety and depth are unfortunately lacking in Cosmonautica.\n\nIn total, I do not regret having spent 10Euros for an enjoyable 9h of gameplay. And maybe, if some variety is added until release or after, I might revisit it for another 10h. So I would still recommend to anyone who likes space adventure and economic games.","June 21, 2015","true","9.2"," 53 of 67 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","53","67","0","0"

Nothing more (yet?). The art style is wonderful and lured me into buying the game, but the gameplay loop is very boring (to emphazise: it's boring, boring, boring!). So what do you really do in this game?\n\n1. You stop at planets and trade a few goods (not that entertaining).\n2. You watch (mostly) passivly, whilst your crew is in transit between planets. They work and poop and sleep and that's about it. They don't interact with each other, you (the player) can't really do anything but to double the speed while in transit.\n3. Go to 1.\n3.1. Combat.

It has NOTHING of FTL, except a crew that flies a spaceship, but the similarities end here. You don't have to manage your crew, you don't have to position them, you don't interact with them. It's like watching an aquarium. An aquarium you don't have control over.\n\nThe main problem is, that I can't see how the developer want to salvage the gameplay.

This game is brilliant. You do a couple of things simultaneously in this game. You manage your crew from hiring and firing to promotions and providing for their needs aboard your ship. You manage your ship's layout from recreational rooms to passenger seating to cargo space and even bathrooms. You manage the way you make money from taking missions from space stations to just figuring out profitable trade runs to killing pirates. There's also an overarching story line to follow as well.\n\nThe nuts and bolts of this early access game in its current state as of 18Oct2014: Gameplay of about 3 hours right now. Researching new "stuff" is limited to just expanding the parts of the galaxy you can travel to. You cannot research new rooms or ships yet. The story took me about 3 hours of farting around to get through and that includes purchasing the most expensive ship (all ships were 10k regardless of size or capabilities which is very easy to get right now). Keeping in mind that once more content is added, you will be able to research new ships. The game works flawlessly in its current state and is very fun to play.

You will embark as a fledgling trader and slowly build up wealth allowing you to upgrade your ship and hire on new crew;than buy a better ship only to better upgrade it and hire on more crew; all the while attempting to find the best trade routes to make more money.\n\nPros:\n\n-  Graphics are well done, having a cartoony look/atmosphere to them.  While at first I was kind of taken back by it but quickly loved it especially as you start finding all the underlaying humor and quips at famous movies, punch lines, and even the dev's add in their own humor with the writing in game.\n\n- The witty humor and comical movie referances really add a refreashing change to present games.  I personally enjoy actually reading the mission briefings and alerts because there is always a light hearted feel to it.  I've found this has actually made me enjoy the "montonity" of doing trade runs, transporting passangers, smuggeling goods because there is always some underlaying humor written.\n\n-  The music is enjoyable and envelopes you into the atmosphire of the game.\n\n-  When you load the game, there is a ticker on the bottom of the screen that the devs update including a ETA as when to the next patch/update can be expected.  This I EXTREAMLY love because this lets you know that this game is being continously worked on and re-enforces that the investment you put into the game is actually valued.\n\n-  The tech tree is enjoyable and adds a nice twist to the game.\n\n-  You are able to customize your ship from the inside,(and external coloring as well as ship name) allowing you to have a real visual of what the ship looks like inside.\n- On the topic of being to see inside of your ship, you are able to actaully see your crew go about doing their duties and performing defferent actions.  Nice touch.\n\n-  Crew members will gain exp allowing you to invest points to improve their current specialty, or you can try unlocking two other possiable skills they posses.  They also may have secondary skills, either being good or negative.  Plus crew histories are a wee bit comical to read as well.\n\n- You are not limited to just one solor system, there are others out there, how ever, you need to research them first before unlocking them.\n\nNow before we continue onto the cons, just remember this is a early access game and it does seem the devs really do care and are striving to produce the best game they can produce.\n\nCons:\n\n- No campaign (yet).  Sadly there is only a tutorial mode or sandbox mode atm.  However there is a campaing button but it is greyed out but it states it's coming soon.  Really hope they release it soon but I'll keep playing the sandbox mode for how, still a lot to do.\n\n-  The time passing in game seems a bit quirky.  One game play movement was slow and it'd take me a few days in game to get from one planet to another, but later in another game play, it'd be crazy fast.  I really don't know if it was from upgrading to a newer ship and researching the engines to improve them (now that I think about it, that may be the case, but I digress)\n\n- NO SAVE FEATURE? Come on.  There "is" one, when you quit the game, but I'm not used to that.  I wish there was at least a choice in the options to either be a "realistic save" (save only upon quit) or "normal save" (allowing you to save when you want.  This being said, there were a few instances where the game had crashed and somehow the game saved before being close, resulting in me being spawned into a space port but the money I made selling goods was in my bank and upgrades to my ship were intact.\n\n-With no campaign so there is'nt any end-game content.  HOWEVER, it IS still very fun and I actually do enjoy playing this game so...keep that in mind\n\nAll in all, for $10, this game is well worth it's weight in salt.  I whole heartedly recommend this game.  Just keep in mind it's EARLY ACCESS, so be ready for a few bugs and issues.  Other than that, download and enjoy!","April 24, 2015","true","15.4"," 28 of 35 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","28","35","0","0"

Cosmonautica is one of the few exceptions to that. This game is most definitely worth the asking price of $10 at this point. And if they just clean it up a bit it will most likely go down as a classic in the light hearted space game genre. All that it is missing is a whimsical narrator and it will be like the spaceship centered counterpart to Startopia.\n\nIf you do buy the game and play it here are my tips:\n\n1. Make sure to play the tutorial. This game is not the easiest game at first. Like Dwarf Fortress you must balance your rooms and jobs. The first time I jumped into the game I didn't hire a pilot... do hire a pilot, you need them.\n\n2. The tutorial glitches at first. Don't just start buying stuff. I think you need to let a little time pass in the game world. I went to the solar system map and hit fast forward and the tutorial kicked in.\n\nThat's all. After that it was smooth space sailing\n\nEverything is not enabled at this point, so I could see myself adjusting this review if the devs truly drop the ball. I just don't see that happening right now. Everything about Cosmonautica tells me it is just the kind of game I like to play and I hope it stays that way as it grows.\n\nIf you like management type games like Dwarf Fortress, or space adventuring games like Space Rangers, do pick this up. I don't think you will regret it.","November 20, 2014","true","12.8"," 25 of 30 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","25","30","0","2"

Also some space fights that make barely any sense and mostly just take a ton of time, since you can't fast forward them (waaaay to ez to win).\n\nAnd i got stuck because the game requires you at some point to make a strategical desicion without giving you any information to base it upon.

Even the characters and art style look fine.\n\nBut its the mechanics that let this game down.\n\nCombat is not up to scratch as quite often you run out of ammo before doing to much damage to your opponent. A prolonged fight results in running out of ammo and then paying a ransom for your surrender. Then head to a shipyard for expensive repairs (~20k). Taking into account vessel combat requirements with rooms dedicate to ammo storage, turrets, torpedo bay etc, while also employing 3-4 specialised crew to man these stations costs money. A lot of money. At the end of the day just focus on cargo and passengers and if a fight arises, just call the aggressor and pay a ransom, its much cheaper ($600-$2500) than all the above requirements.\n\nCrew members can go on strike if their needs are not met. What are their needs? Whos knows, clicking on the profile of a striker reveals no negative information, though occasionaly before strike you may see some negative effect which, more often than not, is getting a bee in their bonnet due to another crew mate having a different food preference. Seriously! The more they are levelled up the crazier they get.\n\nThe tutorial is inadequate with the trading section been the end of it and from memory finishes with "you have 14 days to do some trading". Thats not a tutorial, and by the time you get up to some combat, your paying for a lot of trial and error.\n\nThe game crashes quite reguarly, once or twice every hour with a runtime error, thats apparently wide spread.\n\nJobs given out from spacestations quite often require sourcing and delivery of 30x of X resource, however there is very rarely enough of that resource in the whole system to suffice the job.\n\nSometimes smuggling jobs start from A and involve collecting contraband from planets B and C to deliver to D. Quite often you will run out of time or even with sufficient cargo space it just wont get loaded or more gets loaded than the job specified and when you get to location D, it won't unload, resulting, after a time period, a failed job with a large penalty for you.\n\nIt would be nice if you could go back to an earlier save to prevent the wasting of big $$$ but Cosmo employs an auto save feature that saves over your older save. No going back = lots of time wasted.\n\nPretty soon it becomes a big boring grind.\n\nI truly hope developers Chasing Carrots deliver something greater next time, but as it is Cosmonautica feels like its missing some essential pieces and now its 6 months post release it'll probably stay that way.","January 24","false","32.9"," 19 of 22 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","19","22","0","0"

They want to make the game worthy of praise\n\nCONS\n-Still pretty buggy and crashes occasionally, but not to the point of making the game unplayable\n-The missions are very repetitive and predictable\n-Space battles aren't that exciting\n-Moderate learning curve\n\nSUGGESTIONS\n-Would be great if there were diplomacy options or the chance to establish your own production/trading stations\n-The option to create a small fleet or galactical trading empire would be a plus\n-More weapons and room options\n-Much larger variety of missions\n\nAll in all, if you like economical sci-fi simulators, this is a pretty sweet game. I'm sure it will develop over time to be even better. It's definitely a good start.

Smuggling slaves is so profitable, you can just throw out max bribes for 80% success and still walk away selling 5 slaves for $25,000 profit. If you don't want to smuggle, you can also trade weapons legally for slightly less profit.\nMissions are fun, but the rewards need to be rebalanced. Just keep in mind the starter ship is very slow, and you're going to need speed to complete a lot of the more rewarding missions.\nSpace combat doesn't have any appeal right now past destruction missions, so if you're intercepted randomly, just save your ammo and Flee. The restock costs aren't worth it.\nRoom effectiveness depends entirely on placement.

Get it in sale if you like the genre 10 hours of garanteed fun.\n\nThe good:\n- Graphics, artstyle: Love it.\n- Vibe: Gives a good space feeling. A lot of travelling, which is real. Audio is good and helps with this.\n- Ship management: the minimal space in your ship makes it that you almost always have too few spaces to get everything, which encourages you to apply your best and preferred set up.\n- Challenging curve in the start to get a new ship.\n\nThe Bad:\n-limited interactions, animations: It's the bare minimum. This makes travelling, one of the major parts you will be doing, get boring FAST.\n-Balance: Two huge flaws:\n- Pirate missions reward the most and it's faster to do the low impact missions: less repair costs and you can do more in one time you need to fight a high difficulty enemy, which means you earn more eventually in less time. BREAKS GAME, makes it boring.\n- Once you have enough money for a specific level of ship (not spoiling) you will be able to complete the game and progress through. At this point you know you can beat everything, and there will be no need to buy another ship and exploring other worlds does not provide anything.\n\nThe Ugly:\n- as mentioned above: many planets and solar systems to explore, but there is no need to find them, except the achievement.\n- Weird bugs.\n- fights are limited and sometimes it does not do what you want.\n\nSo I am mixed, you will have fun but not for long.

You can also buy items from planets markets that produce items let's say one planet produces art while another planet consumes. You can buy low and sell high.

Overall, this is a nice game which is what many players wanted to have from a game.\n\nThe Pros:Humorous - This game has uplifting, groovy music, caricaturized characters, and funny dialogue options. It's clear that this is the kind of loose simulator that doesn't take it too seriously, but surprisingly enough, it is packed with features. I liked that it was able to offer so much versatility while still keeping it fun.\n\nThe Art Style - One of the first things you notice is the brightly colored, cartoony graphics that the game uses. For some reason it just feels right for what this game is trying to achieve, considering the humorous nature of the game. The game runs very smoothly and has a decent set of graphical options and resolutions.\n\nFreedoooom! - The game has two modes: Campaign and Sandbox. Other than that campaign mode has predetermined solar systems and a short questline, whereas sandbox randomises your start and contains no starting questline, they are identical in gameplay and neither restrict you. You are free to do as you please, which is to be expected from a simulation game.\n\nRandomised Versatility - There are many missions to undertake, goods to buy and sell, people to hire or fire and galaxies to explore, and the best thing is that this game randomises everything! Proceduraly generated Universe and random missions and crew-for-hire at all space stations.\n\nExcellent UI - The user interface is very well made. It manages to remain very organised and intuitive despite the fact that it displays a lot of info. The font is nice, the colors are well used, and it has a hint of Borderlands to it.\n\nSteam Integration - Apart from lacking co-op, this game has the basic Steam needs: Achievements, Trading Cards, and most importantly, Steam Cloud.\nThe Cons:Grind Fest! - This game is very fun at first, but then it gets kind of repetitive, especially because everything must be researched!!! And this is an aspect that I really don't get. Ok, you need to research the outer rings of the solar systems in your computer to casually explore it, but why do I need to research an extended bedroom or bathroom or a kitchen, that I won't even install, but the people at the shipyard. It's like passing near Ikea but going to buy raw materials and reverse engineer a piece of furniture, then going to Ikea and have them sell it to you. What?! Also, these researches take time, a lot of time, and during that time you are bound to grind away, trading through space. I wish it was less grindy and a bit... realistic? Also, trading is what you will mostly end up doing throughout the game, so if you like this kind of activity, great! But if you are a more action oriented gamer, this game is not for you.\n\nUnsatisfactory Combat - No matter how skilled your crew is, they will somehow find a way to screw battles up. Some of them straight off go to sleep while others fire missiles at the enemy, and sometimes the Pilot will just move in random directions, even fleeing despite the fact that you would clearly win. The combat system needs more polish.\n\nYou... Don't Exist! - You are a god-like being, almost controling your crew like the Sims, but you don't exist. You don't appear, nor have a room in the space ship. It's like you are telepathically making decisions, which is a little disappointing. I mean, it would have been great to have yourself as a no-fee employee and improve your skills and such over time. But the game and everything in it treats you like you do exist, such as NPCs and mission dialogues.\n\nImpossible Perfect Late Game - This game almost tries to tell you that you shouldn't aspire to be the best - because if you do upgrade your ship and your crew to great heights, you will be very sad to find out that your upkeep will be so high, that it's almost impossible to make ends meet.\nConclusionSo, is this game worth it? Well, yes and no. I recommend this game to anyone who likes space exploration and trading, and enjoys micromanaging everything, even if you have to do the same things over and over again. People who like trading games will surely like this one. For people who want the complete space experience however, this isn't the game for you. It features lots of great elements from other great games and tries to cram them all in one, but something is still missing. The poorly made battle system and the long wait of pointless research make it enjoyable only for some.\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more of my recommended games, you can view all my OCG reviews here, and be sure to follow our curator group:  Original Curator Group","August 31, 2015","true","8.9"," 42 of 68 people (62%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","62","42","68","2","1"

I assumed that the developers would add more ships, rooms, meaningful staff interactions and events to the game.  I was wrong.  The basic rooms were strung along in a research system that, although interesting and fun in concept with better endgame, added nothing but waiting to use basic rooms.  The staff interactions saddened me the most. Passively the only effect here is that everyone spends 40% of their time pooping.  Actively events happen and then you get 2-4 dialogue options which as far as I know don't do a thing.  I was hoping for characters to get in spats or at least make decisions that impacted their lives in some way other than giving them enough pills and bathrooms. Right now you will just fly the same routes doing the same missions over and over, grinding, grinding, grinding.  This game had a lot of potential, but exited early access in the same form as when I started playing it.\n\nTLDR: repetative, grindy, does not live up to my expectations.","August 5, 2015","false","16.6"," 16 of 21 people (76%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","76","16","21","2","2"

A little buggy, but fortunately the game auto-saves constantly so its not really much of an issue. After the brief storyline, which I was able to accomplish in about 8 lazy hours, the game essentially becomes a giant trading sandbox. which is still entertaining, but gets old really fast. The combat is done well, and the ship modifications are a nice touch. I just wish there were more options. I literally researched everything possible in about an hour.\n\nThe most teadious thing about trading is how hard it is to keep track of where you can make the most profit and off of what, some sort of mechanism to track where the most profitable nearby ports are would be very helpful. Also what exactly do I do with money after I own the best ship and have a maxed out crew? It would be awesome to be able to buy another trading ship and have an entire AI fleet to manage, maybe setting up auto routes? Hopefully that is coming in the future.\n\nAll and all this game is done very well for casual players and less hardcore "tycoon" style players.

You can get various people with various skills but you get to buy other crew from other planets but some planets may have better crew than others which is the same for various other things. Travelling to other planets takes a while but you can speed up time and watch your crew do various things and even give them tasks so they don't lose to much morale from being overworked or bored from lack of work. For early access it's very fun and playable with more features to come so I highly reccommend picking it up now as later it will increase in price so if this is your type of game it would be wise not to wait as you also help the development.\n\nI give it an 8.5/10 for being unique, fun and full of things to do from missions to just buying some cargo and selling it for more on another planet.\n\nYouTube Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gifret_tF_0","September 17, 2014","true","1.1"," 17 of 23 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","17","23","0","0"

The core is a fancy space trading simulator, with piracy and minimissions tossed in a relatively randomized galaxy. Not completely horrible, but not spectacular either.\n\nIt still holds some glitches and errors in it - things that should be patched up. But despite that, at its core is a reasonable game for the price.\n\nEdit;\n\nSo you probably want to know more about it - well, its a space sim game. You are a captain of a spaceship and need to decide how to make the most of your ship and crew to get better in the world. And better ships, more monety and all that usual stuff. The tutorial is done well, giving you a purpose and trying to explain how to get further out and explore. But it doesn't hold your hand, you need to at least understand the basics of the "buy low and sell high" trading dynamic for the basic profits. Sandbox fits the description with no requirements but your own, and the campaign is not yet done.\n\nThe gameplay is set very similar to the Sim Tower style of placing rooms inside a ship for the crew needs, then hiring your choice of crew for tasks. You can set the tasks and leisure times of the crew and need to balance it all to run effectively. Don't waste crew overlapping a task when you only need one piloting at a time or cramming the bunk beds cause you didn't realize everyone's off-duty at the same time. So it has some management and planning, but its not quite like the more modern Sims - you don't command the crew directly. Just have them do their tasks and slot the timing. Then watch. The main game is the trading and travel, with the extras on the side.\n\nCrew can level up and get better, but the higher levels also mean more needs and demands, and its up to you to supply that for the voyage. You can mitigate some of it by shore leave by staying at stations for a day before a trip, but they may get stressed out on longer trips if you don't have appropriate facilities on board. And that's back to the ship planning and room layout, much like the older Sim Tower as I said. If you ever played that game enough, you'll get this easy. Took me a bitto figure out the staying at a station part, but that was really helpful once I got it - just speed up the "time" while docked. You pay the crew for sitting still, but they get relaxed for it better than you usually can on a trip with the ship.\n\nShip travel is selected by you, but the speed is all determined by the pilot skills, if you have a pilot for all 4 shifts, the ship goes faster. But not all skills like that need to be so extensive, and you'll find yourself shuffling the crew roster over time for the right mix of skills as it kind of becomes a test vs the RNG to get the right mix together. Each crewmember also has needs and specials, and you'll find yourself constantly rethinking which crew you have as you may end up with needs you don't want - and overeater can kill your plans for having the cook on board, and a sporty one that needs a fitness room you can't place well can be annoying. But that's back to the shore leave for a solution sometimes, and you'll make do.\n\nThe primary game is mainly trading, buy low and sell high. You can also become an exclusive transport for passengers or piracy in it, but the game needs some balance between it all for it to work out better. Piracy doesn't pay nearly as well as trading, and passengers can work out but needs some tweaking for the delivery time and rewards to really pay off for the investment. And not all tasks can be done well. Certain crew mixed and ship designes just can't accommodate certain ammounts of passenggers, and the combat is something else...\n\nThe space travel around the stars are split between 3 rings. The Inner set is the safe zone - no piracy, short trips and easy to get to locations. The Middle has a chance of piracy towards the outter edge, but not frequent. It has longer travels and really requires the ship to start running effectively. The Outer is the hardest. It can have some of the most lucrative trading options out there, but its the hardest to get through with the Piracy almost guarenteed.\n\nTo gain acess to the rings you need to research it, another crew task, with another room requirement. It can also be used to research other stars to travel to for even more ring research for travel. There is other options for ship and room research, but not implemented as of this writing.\n\nSpace combat is diferent than you'd expect. You command when the ship fires and activates its short-lived powers availible through certain rooms like hacking or shields. The movement is automatic tho, so its pretty fluid. Damage at this stage in Alpha doesn't mean its a doomed ship when your hull is 0, instead its more work for repair crews and strain for the trip. That and an opposing ship doesn't surrrender to a crippled ship, tho they will run when their health drops low. Perhaps some balance is needed to finish making the danger more real, without it becoming more troublesome. As it is, you need certain rooms that take up space for combat, and each swhip has certain limitations on how many weapon types it can use and where to place them.\n\n\nAll and all, its a very promising game. Could use some polish and perhaps more tweaking here and there - but it does the concept well for how it wants to. Definetly one to watch for the future, especially with the intensive dev involvement here.","February 24, 2015","true","22.5"," 17 of 23 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","17","23","0","0"

Still I have had fun playing this, as well as fustration.\n\nGameplay consists of the player being the captain of a starship with your goal being to amass as much money as you can. Your ship travels through the galaxy with you being able to view it and your crew in an ant farm type view. The missions offered on the different stations provide the most stable source of income, but you can try your hand at playing the trabing game between imports and exports. Or if your ship is set up in the right way you can set out to hunt down pirates or smuggle illegal goods.\n\nHere is something that I was disappointed about. You can't capture criminals, there is a bounty-like system but it isn't as gratifying as it should be. Nor do you need to deal with people trying to raid your shipments. Pirates like to pick fights with you but if you bribe them they just leave you alone.\n\nWhile I'm on the topic here are some other things I didn't like:\n-no character avatar. Sorry capt'n you're just the ghost of the ship\n-you don't interact with the crew. You are limited to setting the work schedule and the promotions. Can't be having the      pilot and the cook go off for alone time ya' know?\n-battles don't have much finesse about them. Maybe because you're supposed to be a trading vessel but still.\n-You can't pick a career. What if I wanted to be a pirate huh?\n-There isn't much to do when traveling between worlds\n--(this is the big one) In sandbox mode you can't change any of the settings. Random really means random.\nI have a small gripe about always pulling into a space station, but I don't think it's that big of a game killer.\n\nBut it's not all bad. There are some things that were pretty good:\n+The trading system is pretty diverse and believable\n+Your crew can be as diverse or inclusive as you want. A greater option of aliens would have been nice.\n+Humor isn't obnoxious, nor are the pop culture references unlike some other games.\n+challenge curve gets kind of steep, but never feels unfair.\n\nUnless there's a curve ball down the line this game will get rather tedious fast unless you can learn to enjoy the challenge. Even though I listed more negatives than positive I like this game for my own reasons and I recomend this to everyone, even if only to try it out a little. Bottomline: don't think about where it came from, just take the money and run!","July 21, 2015","true","8.4"," 15 of 20 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","15","20","0","0"

Example: When you are low on money, the game suggests you should make the switch to a smaller space ship. BUT: you can not sell your old ship. Instead you have to pay the smaller ship, lose your bigger old ship but don't get any refund for it. The result would then be, you have a smaller ship and less money then before. I don't really think that's how it's meant to work.\nTaking all that into consideration, the game seems very unfinished.\n\nAlso the devs pretty much just told that they won't update the game anymore, because they are busy with their new game.\n\nSo you get an unfinished game, that will never be more than it is now.\n\nWould not buy again.

You need to manage the space and modules on your ship, you need to hire/fire/promote (or simply: manage!) your crew, get missions, trade, think, if needed - fight. All the things you do have even visual impact on your ship (which can currently be customised in terms of what facilities it has, where they are placed, but also in terms of visuals, and more features such as customizable crew uniforms are coming!), which isI' great, and reminds me of the games from my childhood in early 90's.\n\nAs said - it does remind me of the games from my childhood - it combines the traits of sea faring games with the fun factor of management sims such as Airline Tycoon, and all that with a pinch of interstellar adventure.. it's almost as if Privateer met Airline Tycoon, with just a bit of Pirates! for the taste ;).\n\nI'm really impressed with this game, and I only started playing it.

Granted the game is still in early access, but there's a few minor things I'd like to see polished and improved upon.\n\n1) The crewman are worse than real life humans, spending more time away from work than actually doing their work.  In the four shifts available, they cannot stay at their station for a single shift.  Even giving them but one shift to work and 3 off, they are late to arrive and must leave early to eat, sleep, or be merry.  I've clustered these rooms together for efficiencies but that doesn't appear to help resolve any issues.  Tighten up the reigns on these slackers a bit, I should at least overwork them before they leave their shifts early.\n\n2) Combat needs to slow down time.  Currently entering combat time just keeps flying by, taking 4 or 5 days to complete a single encounter.  Crewman are abandoning posts to eat, dump, and sleep, and rightfully so if you've got to sit at a turret for 5 days.\n\n3) Galaxy map needs more tools, mainly to flag if visited and how much research has been done.  Once I left my starting galaxy, I was never able to find it again or the galaxy keeps resetting to unexplored each time I left it.\n\nOtherwise, I'm enjoying this managment style of game.","March 22, 2015","true","93.9"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","0"

The atmosphere is relaxing and casual. There are a lot of bugs still as this is in early access and the game crashes every so often (sometimes frequently). That being said I have enjoyed it thoroughly in early access. I recommend it to anyone who gets in the mood to play games like The Sims or Banished as both of these games are addictive, relaxing, and have a respectively low learning curve as compared to some more complicated city builders out there. Right now it is enjoyable enough discovering the best strategy to earn more income to upgrade your ship, give crew members raises, or hire more crew members. As they gain experience they have increasing needs beyond the basic fulfillment of hunger, sleep, hygiene, toileting. If they are unhappy or do not have their needs met they will become sick and unable to work. It oftentimes becomes a balance to build items/rooms that meet their needs vs. items/rooms that can generate more income.  More specific ways to generate income beyond general trading of items from one planet to another include: delivering passengers planet to planet, smuggling of illegal goods/persons, and space combat. These are some of the dynamics you will find as far as gameplay is concerned. I look forward to more content in the future.","April 30, 2015","true","17.0"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","12","17","0","0"

So, it simply does not tell you how to play it, and though 80% of it is pretty intuitive, that leaves about 20% of the game that leaves even a veteran gamer like myself going WTF?\n\n(Added: I keep seeing claims in the forums that there is a tutorial that makes perfect sense, though even some that say that say they needed to read every message from your ship's robo-bird at least twice to catch it... The supposed tutorial is imbedded in the rest of the chatter in the game and I found it hard to follow, and sorely lacking in anything but the most basic instructions.)","August 2, 2015","false","34.9"," 15 of 23 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","15","23","0","0"

You go around, hire some crew, assign them, and watch them do stuff.\n\nYou have some pretty basic ship customization here. The interior can be rearranged however you like. There are a pretty good amount of options avaliable already for what type of ship you want to pilot. Will you be a trader or a taxi service? Pirate or bounty hunter? Your ship design will reflect how well your crew perform at the job, so don't place the ammo too far from the guns.\n\nInstead of hyperdrives and wormholes, you travel by the gravitation pull of each planet. Pretty nifty concept. Resources aren't such a problem you'll ever get stuck somewhere, and there's lots of ways to make money so you'll always feel like you're moving forward.\n\nThe music and sound are decent enough, and I like the colorful graphics, though no boundries are getting broken in any of those departments.

While I want to love it, there's so many things its bad at, it sucks the enjoyment out of the game.\n\nTL:DR : Bad balence, bad optimisation, and crash ridden. Don't waste your money.\n\nEdit: As of the most recent patch (1.1.8) which has taken nearly 2 months since the games launch, none of the crash bugs I've experienced have been fixed. Its still bug ridden and one to avoid.\nEdit 2: As of patch 1.1.9, which claims to have fixed the crash bugs, i'm still getting crashes every 20 minutes or so of gameplay.\n\nThe overall concept is good. Get ship, hire crew, travel galaxy, make money, upgrade ship, uncover mystery, repeat. Unfortuantely almost every aspect of that falls flat. If you don't have a crew with matching needs, they will end up fighting and going on strike. Trading is a grind with a pretty much none existant economy. Transport the highest cost goods the planet exports to another and you will make profit. Upgrading your ship? I'd completely finished the research tree before leaving the starter system. And combat? Its either laughably easy or a total grind. There is no in between ground with it.\n\nThe game promised to be 'Sims in Space' with an upgradable ship and trading. What you get is 'grind while you wait'. Its repetative, overly simplistic and dull with little to no replay value.\n\nSo your hours in game? My time was spent having to restart or reload nearly every 20 minutes as the game WILL crash at some point no matter what your doing. Buying goods? Game will Crash. Upgrading Ship? Game will crash. Just flying at low speed through space? Game will crash.\n\nIts badly optimised, badly balenced and a bad waste of money.","August 12, 2015","false","8.4"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","10","14","0","1"

It was fun for a few hours, but after that, I found alot of unfinished items, and was boring.\nFor the sim like experience they don't do or are effected by much, they: eat, sleep, poop (alot), and do their work thing. What buggs me about this, is if they are not doing thier work at the time it is needed for an outcome, such as hacking to reduce the chance of being caught doing illigal stuff it does not matter paying for them to tag along. All you really need is a pilot, a robot cleaner and a robot repair.\nSimes: Medic: useless, Repair and cleaning: replaced by bots, Shooter: combat broken so useless\nCombat: I made a fully equiped combat version of the combat ship, fitted it out and had multiple shooters, hacker, pilot. Results were that it is nearly impossible to hit pirates, by the time you get thier shields low your pilot is done, can't fly and they all have to poop , eat, and sleep, so they are incapasitated so navigation is zero. All I ever do now is flee and sometimes that don't work because the pilot navigation will go down due to over exhaustion.\nTrade: buy green arrowed items, sell red arrowed items. Other than that there is no real way of determining if something will be very profitable other than the planet arrows.\nIlligal trade, need a hacker to get you past cops that "randomly" check you every time you carry an illigal item.\nPassengers, make sure you can get to the destination on time before you accept and if you need to go pick them up somewhere else first.\nScience: researching the only thing availabe in the game which is planet discovery is not very useful. Trade there is the same so the cost of going there in crew costs is not worth it really, and they expect you to deliver mission items in the same period of time as closer planets so alot of them are impossible. All other research is not there and unfinished.\nGame crashed on me 3 times so far. This is a 1/2 gb game... wtf? I have a new msi 2013 gamming laptop with a dedicated card that can play most anything and should not crash my entire desktop. It works on the intigrated graphics as well when it don't crash. Have had artifacts of other menues when switching from one to another.\nLast thing I would say is there is not alot of customization really other than filling th room slots, so once your rich , there is nothing to upgrade, and no reason to upgrade. Like I said, boring.\nUnless there is a ton more work done to make this more dynamic and make the combat work, I cant see it getting better, even with the patches making the game to it's targeted 100%. I dont think It has alot of replay value. Devs should play some sim titles  / cities to give them an idea or two and eve online.  I would also suggest a turn based combat system since it would mabe work better, feel fair, and mabe suspending the sim toilet, sleep, food, requirements while its going on.

Good potential.\n\nBad gameplay.\n\nFirst of all, it's mosty about trading. Buying some stuff for cheap and selling high. It does not matter what you buy, trading goods (even illegal weapons) have no use except for selling. Names or types of the goods that you carry are not important. You just buy it from a planet's shop owner and sell to another. Actually, all the planets are the same: same shop and the same salesman. The whole universe, except for the planet icons on the map, all the same. Same dock, same station, same shop, same armory.\n\nThe campaign and the story is also not complex nor dedicated. It's just some elements from the sandbox mode.\n\nSo, what you do in this game universe are, also limited:\n\n- Buy some goods and sale them.\n- Carry some passangers to another planet.\n- Shoot some bad guys and their ships down. (Totally random. The ships and their captains always change. eg, if you're after -let's say- smuggler Xenopod, each time you catch his ship, or her, it's a different ship with a different guy/girl claiming to be Xenopod..\n\nCombat scenes are a bit entertaining, but since it has no purpose at all but earning some money and loot, gets boring.\n\nThere are alien races. And religions. But it only has a meaning for your crew's internal relations -love or hate-. That's it.\n\nThere are no states, no unions, no factions, nothing at all.\n\nSummary: It's a universe full of random ships flying by with random missons on dozens of clone -same- planets.\n\nShould buy it: No, not yet.

Let me lay my opinion on the line here from a couple of hours of initial gameplay (Which I have no doubt will grow to a few more [albeit modest] hours in the future)\n\nThis is a casual game by far. In that sense I've personally found it rather zen. You've no doubt gotten a fair idea of what the gameplay is. You manage a crew in a basic sense aboard your vessel. You travel around, first, one solar system trading, smuggling and fighting to accrue money. This cash goes towards bigger vessels and more capability to extend your activities further abroad. Beyond that overall premise, you have to manage the crew you use to staff said craft and their relationships and needs. As they become more skilled they require more effort to keep them satisfied (A feature which, thanks to a recent addition of bonuses, you can come close to bypassing to an extent early on if the money is flowing),\n\nIf you are someone like me that's happy to provide a narrative (Other Dwarf Fortress and Paradox Grand Strategy players will understand) for the game you'll enjoy this, but superficially. There's plenty of capacity to do so but it is provided with a quite limited depth.\n\nThere's a comedic element to the game which works quite well, but I personally don't take that in too much as (as mentioned above) I enjoy supplying my own narrative to the game. That being said it provides a level of enjoyment to the game even if it can be found to reduce the 'immersion' factor.\n\nTo give a TL;DR overview though, if you are looking for a relaxing game set around Captaining a ship and crew while jaunting around getting into whatever adventures you see fit, this is a great game to destress to. If you want more complexity in your zero-G adventuring, check out the X series or EVE online.\n\nAll being said and done, with the above caveats, I will recommend this title as a simple, enjoyable and satisfying experience. Additionally, the devs seem to be taking comments on board and working to adjust gameplay in an ongoing fashion.\n\nPS. A couple of things that I think this game requires:\n- The ability to speed up time to a greater extent\n- More intricate and involved crew requirements and procedural command events (There are some, I hope there will be more as I go on)\n\nOverall, once again, I've found this a relaxing and satisfying game. It will likely get repetative in the future (And I will update my review accordingly) however that's the lot of a ship captain in reality isn't it? Haul cargo, wash rinse and repeat with a dash of combat and smuggling to make it interesting. If the devs continue to update accordingly, it will continue to satisfy unless you're looking for an ultra-deep and complex experience. In that case, look elsewhere.","December 10, 2015","true","3.1"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

(you know a few seconds different is too long for game with nothing to do).\n- Confusing travel system. I meant when I go to pretty far planet, the time I need is only like 3 days in-game time, but when I travel to a nearby planet I need like 7 days in-game time... and vice versa... the hell. And I can't decide my ship go left or right, annoying eh, why annoying? cus example if go left of the sun orbit you clearly see that is to far from your target planet but the game tends to take that route .... bam!!! *flying keyboard* DIE YOU STUPID AI!\n- You can not directly order a crew. So if there is emergency you can't take that being number one priority immediately.\n\n\nNote :\n= No estimated times for multiple docking, no estimated prices, so if you need to deliver a requested good/s can be screwed often by not delivering it on time or the goods you needed are puking expensive than the reward you received, means no profit after the long journey. Dammit!!!\n= There is 8 different job skills cleaner, repairer, pilot, scientist, medic, shooter, hacker, cook\n= I think the max crew member is 8.\n= 10 different ship at the store with each of them had its own slot for Rooms, Turret, Cannon, Torpedo. But some does not at all of specific slot like no Torpedo or no Cannon or both.\n= More room type need to be researched first before able to use, but after finish it you need to buy it from someone store... okay, buying for the material I guess...\n= Only 3 type of weapons as the slot of ship described with each of it own ammunition... yeah rather boring with no variant.\n= If you think there is mining mechanic, then you got wrong game, this game only buy, sell or take by force... pirate... thing...\n= Each solar system consist 3 rings with each ring contain a number of planets. ring 2 and ring 3 are locked and need to be researched first.\n= Shield of the ship are not active all the time, kinda like some skill in MMO, need player command to activate it for a few seconds and cooldown. And in order the ship can use shield, player must have a shield room type and a hacker or maybe a other crew, ugh I forgot.\n= Very often what items/goods production in description of planet is not there when you really need them for completing your delivery mission even after your try to search it to a far away planet, and if your patient meter is not that high, I suggest steer away from this game.\n\n\nI got more than 20 hours of play-time are because when still in early-access I really support this game development, so every update I always try till I got bored... and now? things are not that great so yeah I'm not bother trying to get a single game achievement yet.\n\n\nResult : just boring traveling, and the battle is not as fun as it look like. The trader job is too, not that fun and rewarding... if you lured by the screenshots in the steam store, better look for friend and ask to borrow from him\her.\n\nnot recom from me, but I do hope someone else creating this kind of game but with a lot of improvements. But thanks to the dev for trying, I know it's hard making a game for pleasing everyone, except you created it for your own enjoyment huehuhehehehehe.","May 24","false","26.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

You can delegate tasks between crew members. You can also fast forward the speed of time during travel which is nice, especially when you have a set-up you can't tinker with until you get more money (or whatever).\n\nBut since the main goal seems to be to get the most money, the game falls a bit short. It's difficult to get an idea of how trading works as the tutorial (not only crashed on me when I played it) but didn't explain the concept very well. Additionally, I found that the "most effecient" way to find out what planet wanted what, was to write down the things for sale on the planet I was on, then click each other planet to see if I could see it there.\n\nThe missions available at the bars vary, but the difficulty level seems to ramp up pretty quick, if it ramps at all. Some missions (escort) that I've seen were not physically possible. On one occasion I was supposed to pick up someone on Limepine and take them to Chockpern. The mission gave me 5 days to accomplish this. It was only after I stopped at the first planet did I realize it would take me 6 days to make the trip. So I failed the mission with .06 Space Time left. Even more frustrating, I saw the same mission on offer once I got to Chockpern for half the pay with enough time (6 days).\n\nThere are a few graphical glitches (but if you advance the speed it's hard to notice). In the bottom right-hand corner of the screen are the stats of your crew. It's hard to see how they're getting on, as the color indicating their status is a really REALLY light grey. And you won't notice you're in trouble until they reach the top and turn bright red.\n\nI'll keep playing though, I've enjoyed it so far and there's going to be an update 2 days from now (10-28-14). I look forward to giving this game a proper review on my youtube channel once it's done.","October 27, 2014","true","7.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

For example, the game makes it hard to tell whether you would make a profit from trading missons, as all you have to go on regarding the average price of a trade good (before you buy it, that is) is a red arrow pointing left (which I have since discovered means "Sell here") and a green arrow pointing right which means "Buy here". The game itself gives no clear indication over which means which, and I had to find this out on my own.\n\nAnother part that could use some work is the tutorial messages, as some of them pop up at the most random of times and because of this make little sense (for example, my robot parrot AI talking about whether or not I enjoyed my trading mission when I'm in space delivering trade goods.) But the biggest problem with the tutorial messages is there is no-where I can go to read 'em when I need 'em, and a player is left with only their memories of how certain things work and what we are trying to acheive.\n\nBut the biggest problem I find the game has is the problems I run into midflight.\n\nPart of the game's challenge comes in the form of having to feed your crew, and keep your crew clean, and give them somwhere to sleep. But your crew operate on a very strict time-schedule, seperated into four segments when they can be either working a skill they have such as cleaning or repairing or piloting your vessal, jobs that have to be done, or keeping themselves alive and not-so-smelly. A problem with this is, when a scheduled relaxation or work segment ends, they drop whatever they were doing regardless of whether they completed their task and get onto the next one. A little margin for error would be nice, so my alien-pastafari can finish it's shower and not have to cook food stark naked and coated in soap. (but seriosly, if they fail perform their tasks then it becomes a consistant problem and they start skiping work to nap or whatever.)\n\nOn the topic of these time windows, it would be nice if we had a button that both paused the game and let us re-allocate tasks and such without worrying about whether or not Robby hood in the cargo hold is gonna starve if we don't have a pilot at the wheel to get us to his santuary on time.\n\nNow, a lot of my complaints are about what might or might not be intentional features of the game to make it harder. Which is why my last nit-pick is: Why is there no diffiiculty slider? This might be indicative of me being outisde the target market for the game, being worse than some at gaming, but at the end of the day, I bought the game and I'd like to make it further than the first rim. It's wise to either add a diffuculty slider for us less good gamers or make it more obvious that one failed trading mission can drive you to total bankrupcy, and that this game is for people who are gluttons for punishment.\n\nYou might think after reading all that that I don't like Cosmonautica, but that's just not true. I like it, I just don't know if it likes me. It needs work, yeah, but it could be a great game one day, once it loses it's bumps and blisters.","October 31, 2014","true","26.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

But after 7 hours or so, I've come to the conclusion that what it really needs is to be taken off the shelf, put back into beta and given a much more thorough round of testing, because there are too many issues that need to be resolved.\n\nThe economic part of the game looked interesting and I love the idea of managing crew in flight, but it's also tuned so tightly as to be very unforgiving of small mistakes, and managing the ship started to become more frustrating than enjoyable, especially with some obvious bugs showing up on various screens.  When I tried to do a combat mission the game crashed.  I was able to reload and try again, but the combat system was so frustrating that I finally had enough.\n\nSorry guys, but if you want my money, you need to do better than this.

When I resumed a saved game, all of my crew were standing on the roof of my ship running in place, I also saw this happen to a youtuber who played this game.\n2. Whenever I finish combat, my ship no longer has a destination anymore and is just floating in space. I'm not sure if this is a bug, or if you just designed it that way...\n3. Although this only happened once in 5 hours, one time when I went to a store to sell things, the slider still slid back and forth with my mouse after I stopped clicking, leading to the problem that the accept button is all the way on the right, so i couldn't sell. Accepting the 'sale turned into a purchase' didn't fix it, niether did leaving and coming back, quiting and restarting worked though\n4. Right after the bug above happened, I experienced an issue where when I clicked on one of my crew members, the portrait suddenly started following my mouse, and I couldn't place it anywhere. Going to the NODE (which was my origional purpose) didn't fix it, niether did going to the orbital map and back, quiting and restarting did fix it however.\n\nThe music is great, the graphics are great, the gameplay is fun and addicting - although i'm not sure if it's lucrative to be a transport ship in this game: it takes up 2 cargo room for seating and you only get paid very little for the inconvinience it does to your trade. There aren't enough transport missions to be only a transport ship, and being a mix makes it harder to trade with little payoff for transporting. I reccommend just increasing transport mission pay by 1-2000 and having at least 1 guarenteed in every port.\n\nOverall this is shaping up to be a fun space game where you can be a Bounty Hunter, Smuggler, Pirate, an honest Space Trader or a Cruiseliner captain, as long as the bugs get fixed and they install the new technology trees :D","December 30, 2014","true","15.8"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

You have to keep your interstellar crew happy while they zip around the galaxy, fighting and trading. So it has a Sims aspect to it. But here, as in so many other areas, the execution is poor. As your 'Sims' level up, they demand more amenities to keep them happy. But once you install the required room on your ship, the problem goes away, forever. There is no tension involved. Crew unhappy, buy room, problem solved.\n\nThe whole game is like this. At the beginning of the game, you want a shooter who can also clean or repair, so they always have a job. So this is a bit of leveling up strategy, or someone to look for when hiring crew. But later in the game, you can get robots to do the menial work, removing the need to bother with it. Strategy removed.\n\nAs for the trading, it doesn't make sense. Some planets consume, some produce. But there is no overview of this. What's more, it's not very lucrative, compared to...\n\nCombat. Here is where the game is completely broken. Combat involves 'tapping' buttons at the right time. There's not much to it. But compared to trading, it's insanely profitable. There really is no reason to trade. Once you have their hull down to 15%, they will be on the phone to you, offering 40k, 50k, 60k to let them live. Compared to the 7k you can make hauling cigarettes across the map and back. And once you've figured this out, in a matter of hours you'll have the most expensive ship in the game. And then, there is no game anymore.\n\nYes, there's a story, whatever.\n\nFinally, it crashes. A lot. There are in game bugs as well.\n\nStay away.","August 14, 2015","false","25.6"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","10","16","0","1"

I can not recommend this game.\n\nCosmonautica does a lot of things right, unfortunately it does several critical things wrong.  The humor, the graphics, the sound, the visuals are all spot on and to be admired. It's a fun game to get into. But once you do, and get a little bit into the game, the flaws begin to show through and severely limit your ability to play.\n\nThe biggest flaw I came across was a severe lack of balance and difficulty. This is a simple change that could be fixed with the addition of a difficulty slider. See, when you have a game where you trade for credits, that economic model needs to be spot on. Unfortunately even if you do everything 100% correct, the profit margins on trading are razor thin.\n\nIn two hours of play, making only positive trades, I barely was able to re-attain the amount of capital (20k credits) I started the game with as seed money. Another hour and a half later and I was still only around the 30k. Now on it's own, this might be acceptable for some. A game where you have to micromanage razor thin profit margins and grind out credits might be acceptable. But this was all while I was making perfect trades and always turning profit. If you take a loss, at any time, it's absolutely devastating. After 3.5 hours play I got stopped by a cop and had a 15% chance of getting caught. RNG came up and I got caught. This caused me to fail my current quest, which penalized me credits, lost all my cargo, and was banned from that world for 15 days. The effects of this were absolutely devastating to my game, knocking me down well below the 20k mark just to get to a new planet, refitted, and get a new hold of cargo. IE one random chance event, that could only happen 3 out of 20 times, and I'd lost around two hours of gameplay.\n\nThe further issue in the game is in the absolutely horrible combat system. You run out of ammo FAR too quickly, far more quickly than you can possibly take out even the weakest of pirates.  Forget about harder difficulty ships, you don't stand a chance. Ramming doesn’t even work, because the AI can avoid you forever.\n\nI think Cosmonautica has the potential for a good game, but it feels like an unfinished beta at this point.  I would HIGHLY recommend against buying this game at the current state it's in.  (v1.2)","December 11, 2015","false","5.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The trading was difficult and was more like gambling than a valid means of progressing in the game.  One might assume that buying a product in a location that was producing a resource, and then selling it at a location that desired the resource would provide at least a minimal profit.  Not so... it is quite easy to lose money.  After 21 hours of trying to make some good progress I found that the game is very time consuming and frustrating.  I usually ran into trouble with my crew long before I made any money, usually because I couldn't afford to provide for their needs.

This game isn't done. If they stopped working on it now, I wouldn't be playing for much longer. Three hours in, and i've just completed the prolouge, which is the current completion level of the story, but in order to more than quadrouple that time, all they would have to do is give me bigger ships. The sandbox mode is fun, but it's hard to keep in the black when really you have to pick your type of missions, trading, passenger transport, or raiding. It isn't possible as the game stands to play a little bit of all of them without limiting the crew's level, as this keeps their needs simpler.\n\nThat said, gameplay is fun, and well worth the current price tag. 6.99 at time of review.

I can see a great potential and I am very happy with the speed at which development is progressing. Game is already playable and also there is still a lot to do like implement galaxies and more research for a price it is good buy for anyone. Cosmonautica is kept I light relaxing tone and is something you could play with your kids on the Saturday afternoon easily without being worried about any bad influences.\n\nI think however that game could benefit from some changes especially how the time is handled.

Or when you need to plan something carefully but don't want to pay for few days of crew salaries.\n\nOther thing I noticed was problems with buying new ships while in full cargo.

The pics looked good, adds a trading and exploration element, as well as the ability to change up your ship in ports to suit your needs.\n\nAll this combined with the fact that it was a steam greenlight game, the reviews were mixed(most of the bad ones just stupid little gripes about things that didn't even effect game play) and is currently $14.99 USD on steam, meant that it was worth the risk to buy and give it a go.\n\n--Graphics--\n\nAt first glance I was disappointed with the graphics.\n\nThat was until I took a closer look at the way it was done, the creators of Cosmonautica have taken a large attention to tiny little details and overlaid the entire game with a filter that resembles the horizontal lines you used to get with old LCD screens. Which in my opinion gives the game that old sci fi feel, like you're overseeing the play of the game from your own consol on the ship.\n\n--In game world--\n\nThe map is large and unless you're playing in story mode is procedurally generated for that extra replay value. Each solar system map has four rings with a few planets, the starter ring and the next three that you can research to gain access too. Then you have your star chart, you start with one quadrant which usually has three solar systems in it, then you can research further star charts and expand your travels in world.\n\n--Game play/Controls--\n\nControls are a simple point and click interface, most things are fairly self explanatory and everything else you just need to click on for a explanation or description.\n\nGame play is fun and addictive. You start off with a little ship and some money and have to fit out your ship from the start, choosing either to take a few passengers, a lot of cargo or split the difference. You will need to hire staff based on skills and wages, with added traits which can determine how well your staff actually get along.\n\nIt all comes down to managing your staffs well being, meeting deadlines(or suffer a penalty) and making money to improve your ship or just buy and fit out a new one. Then latter on when you have researched a little and have enough crew to man weapons of shields you can ship goods into bad zones(careful of customs and their heavy fines), hunt pirates or just become a pirate yourself.\n\n--Story--\n\nStory mode is fun, you have a slightly psychotic robot parrot as your companion who gives you comical hints on what to do next or just randomly develops red eyes and starts screaming at you, sometimes in command code(and then apologises).\n\n--Overall--\n\nWhen I first started playing it had some bugs, but nothing that affected game play, usually just little things like a crew member doing one thing and the character tile saying they are doing another, that being said the developers at Chasing Carrots are at the top of their game and have any bugs fixed really fast.\n\nThis is a great game and did everything the other games should have done and with a better look, style and with a comical twist(like space ships being modeled after actual ships).\n\nIf you have played FTL or Space rogue and just got bored of it being the exact same thing over and over and over, give Cosmonautica a try.\n\nAgain currently on Steam for $14.99 USD, the Apple store for $6.99 and Goggle play for $8.99 USD\n\nGraphics: 8/10 For style.\nIn-game world: 9/10\nGame play: 8/10\nStory: 7/10\nOverall Score: 8/10","October 14, 2015","true","13.6"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Also note that the graphics aren't quite there.. a bit off here and there.\n\nBut why do I rate it with a thumbs up?\n\nThis game has great atmosphere. Casualwise it has great mechanics. A bit easy (at least at first) but for me personally it's a pleasure to click through and play trading.\n\nBOTTOM LINE?\nIt's (personally) a nice casual game. I'll get my money's worth. HOWEVER, I think the price point should be lower to appeal to a bigger audience.","August 21, 2015","true","31.0"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

Really needs new weapons as a single torpedo is worth any number of other weapons.....\n\nWith some minor tweaks the combat could be amazingly fun, right now really needs some work\n\nEDIT - The combat system needs a massive overhaul as its really boring to have to micromanage everything. If the developer can manage to automate the firing this could really help as micromanaging 3 different people means i dont get to enjoy the fireworks. More weapons are an absolute must the lack of variation on every ship you run into makes combat a very boring affair. Currently only 3 weapons and only 1 thats actually effective. l\n\nAlso there is no feeling of ever being threatened once you have a decent sized ship. A WANTED/bounty system causing you to be tracked by higher level combat ships who wanna rob your ship or arrest you would really spice things up. As it is nobody ever chases or targets you and you feel all your combat and killing the bad guys/transports doesnt have any lasting effect on your ship or character.\n\nGood game but deffinitely needs the developer to add a lot of content. He's got the core concept down and with some fairly minor additions could really have a gem of a game here.

Hauling fertilizer may not yield high profits, but if moving guns meant getting the attention of pirates and grabby governments, I might think twice.\n- One mechanic in the game is that a more skilled crew needs more things which is neat (i.e.: the 5 star pilot needs entertainment, exercise, social exchanges, etc... compared to the 1 star who needs a toilet, food, and a place to sleep). That said; I cannot see what the difference is between the 1 star and the 5 star which makes the need for developing your crew a little moot (i.e.: Maybe a 5 star pilot keeps the ship from being hit in combat and plots faster trips, the better mechanic makes the ships engines faster, the medic buffs everyone so everyone does better, etc)\n- On the same note, I found that the more skilled my crew was (5 star pilot for instance), the more difficult it was to keep their morale even somewhat positive. There are just too many needs that accumulate and the time it takes to service each one (while the others continue to increase) don't leave a lot of room to do anything but go from one need to the next. Possible solution may be to have certain rooms service multiple needs at the same time (the club could be exercise, social, and entertainment and the chef's lounge could be social, food, and fatigue, etc...), or to slow the rate of need accumulation.\n- Despite the variety of planets, would like to see a greater emphasis on more illegal products which might force different paths through space (Weapons could be illegal in a particular area requiring you to step around them, etc...). At the moment, Narcotics is the only product that falls into that category, but its implemented very well.\n- Would like to see 'me' in the game. In the sense that I'm a disembodied 'thing' that tells the crew what to do and where to go, yet I'm not an actual crew member. Would be good to create your avatar, pick the skill you start with, then filling in gaps amongst the crew as you proceed.\n- Would like to see more ship variety and the ability to rename my own ship.\n\nNow all this said and done; I'm writing this review early into their cycle so I'm guessing lots of the above will get changed or addressed, but for now I'm happy to recommend this game to anyone who wants to bend the 'verse to their whims.","October 2, 2014","true","6.2"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Interesting range of ships (but needs to be bigger and include more classes), the commodity model is reasonable (albeit rather basic), very similar to the Privateer model of base types, except that this game allows for bases to be multiple 'types'.\n\nCrew recruitment and requirements can be counter-intuitive and frustrating, especially with limited options at each base and the need to build up a large crew over time.  I would have thought that having a crew that eats different things would lead to better harmony as they're not all competing for the same subset of the food supply (but that's me I guess).\n\nUpskilling crew has one SERIOUS limitation; you don't get to choose the additional skill you would like a crew member to learn if you want to multi-skill them.  This to me is a massive flaw and not representative of the real world, where bosses have a large say in what development paths you follow.  Additionally, the random assignment of special attributes is great during upskilling except that it introduces negative traits quite a bit.  I understand that as people become more specialised they can become less adept in other areas, but given that it's an upskill, at least have special attributes balanced; +1 something, -1 something else.\n\nCombat (before you're ready for it) is even more frustrating because the flee move doesn't seem to actually allow you to evade combat; it should if the game is to be properly balanced IMHO)\n\nMission choices are extremely limited (like Privateer) but the class of missions seems to be even smaller.  Combat, smuggling, or delivery (cargo or passengers).  That would be fine if there was a larger range of destinations and missions to choose from, but there isn't.\n\nFinally, I think the biggest concern I have is that the Devs seem to have moved on to new projects, announcing there is no longer full time support going into this game.  Don't get me wrong; I like the game, but it's incomplete.  There are still some crashes that occur semi-regularly in the game, and there needs to be more content developed for the game to increase choice and range.  I'd like to see more effort put into getting this game right before new games receive focus.\n\nPros:  Reasonably simple trading model, nice touch of ship management with crew, so long as it doesn't impact the flow of the game.\n\nCons: Frustrating crew recruitment and upskilling, poor range of choice generally (ships, missions, new crew, pretty much everything), and no more full time support from the devs.\n\nWhile I recommend this game, I'd love a button for 'undecided'.  It's about a 55/45 split for me at the moment, although I intend to put more time into it to see if familiarity and learning curve change the balance somewhat.

This is very much part of a new generation of gaming where firing weapons doesn’t guarantee long-term victory.  In fact, most of my time has been spent reading, planning and doing a cost-benefit analysis (albeit a very quick 2 minute analysis) as to make the best next move.

Even with all of the issues and the crashes. Iron those puppies out and you have me hooked for a long while. The description and videos you see will give you most of your value in whether to purchase or not. Gameplay lived up to the hype I created for it after finding this gem. Hire your own pilot, janitor, engineer and researcher. Buy and sell goods that can be transported from planet to planet. Manage your ship or the ship will manage you out of a job and into a game over. Take risks with missions in transporting goods that aren't quite listed on the legal side of the law. Don't get caught or you'll pay a hefty fine. Hopefully you have the money to bribe or pay the fine. If not, good luck building it back up again.\n\nYou can add "modules" to the interior of your ship so that it is fitted with the right amount of crew space, cargo holds and necessities to control your space place. Change the name of your ship and the varying color scheme. Change the crews uniform color as well while you are at it.\n\nOverall I'm very happy I made this purchase and have supported what seems to be a very well rounded group of indie developers who are doing their best to deliver what was promised. I hope somebody finds this information useful.\n\n***UPDATE****\nAfter a few updates the game was running much better. Crashes were less often, almost non-existent for me.\nThe problems I began to notice over a longer period of time playing related to the buying and selling of goods from planet/station to planet/station. It was very rare in the first solar system phase that I was able to make a profit on selling goods I purchased at locations that needed that maeterial. This was the biggest disappointment for me. The Contracts were interesting and had some thought put into them. However, managing the location you were headed, how long it would take to get there, how much money you have and whether you can afford to pay your staff, as well as what time limits you have on the contracts you currently have makes it very difficult to plan out a path to make the Contracts truly valuable.\nI've never had a very successful time during space battles. I haven't played a single save to the point where I am able to get more highly skilled shipmates to see if that makes the space battles less of a chore. Battles don't occur frequently however.\n\nOverall this game is interesting but I want to see more contracts made available per station, some login put into the contracts time required to complete, ways to truly build up a profit by buying goods at low cost and selling them at a high payout dependant on needs per location.\n\nWhat I want is a game where I can build my own spaceship, manage my crew, modify the functions of my space ship as to whether it's a space ferry, cargo ship, mercenary, or smuggler. This game has that potential but needs more fine tuning.","April 23, 2015","true","8.7"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

Quite fortunately, my interpetation of what I saw was wholly correct.\n\nThe designers of the game did an excellant job of not taking themselves, and their creation -too- seriously. the game is quite fun and addictive, but tends to be somewhat easy to burn yourself out on. While there is alot of content in the game already, before long, you'll have an outlook of "Been there, done that." at just about every task, oppurtunity, and occurence that comes your way. I've hit that point several times now after a few hours of gameplay each run through, and yet, I can't keep from continuing to play it. The music is groovy, carying a melody and flow to it that's likely nearly unknown to most of this generation's avid gamers, while the graphics are soft enough to run smoothly on even most low-end graphic specs, without looking remotely distasteful.\n\nSpeaking as someone who's dumped alot of their personal time into Space-based management games(E.G. FTL, Kerbal Space Program, Mars Expedition, Starbound, Lunar Flight, X3, etc.) , this game is a very refreshing change of pace. If you're into any of the games mentioned above, but still on the fence about getting this one, I say go ahead.\n\nWhile it isn't done yet, the devs are pretty active on it's improvement, and have thus far shown that they pay attention and respond to the problems/suggestions of their customer base. To me, that's a critical factor for any Early Access Game.\n\nFor what I look for in games, I'd give it a 8/10.

They added some more missions and made the game a bit more stable, which is nice, but it could really use some variety in cobat/ship items etc. to add variety to a playthrough and give it some more replay value.\n\nIf you're a casual gamer like myself and enjoy a quirky sense of humor, this is the game for you.

You sail across different galaxies transporting various goods, passengers, while occasionally (or quite often if you decide to become a pirate/warship) fighting other ships for missions/loot.\n\nSo, gameplay aside, this Not Recommended is more to do with the fact that you can't play the game for any real length of time. It crashes, A LOT, every half hour or so for me, sometimes more often. Thankfully (or perhaps because of this issue?) the game designers used an auto-save function that saves your game after every major (or minor) interaction, pretty much. It saves it before you enter battle, when you get to, and when you leave a space station. Which is pretty much all you do in this game.\n\nThe game also has a bad habit of corrupting save files, making them unloadable. This happens rarely, but when you've put 10-12 hours into a game and all of a sudden you can't access it, it's frustrating to say the least.\n\nBacially, unless you have a burning desire to support the developers and their company, I recommend you stay away from this game until such time as they've fixed the game crash issues, or pick the game up at a deep discount. And keep in mind that you only have 2 hours (as per Steams' refund policy) to determine wheather or not you want to keep the game, because chances are you won't get a refund from them past that mark no matter how horrible your game plays.

If you enjoy casual trading and space exploration games and aren't interested in the mechanics behind what is happening in a game you will probably spend 10 enjoyable hours with this title.","August 13, 2015","true","9.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Not complete despite being out of Early Access. For example upgrading crew skills may not yield the actions tied to said skill, but other actions. E.g. gaining "Repair" for a crew member may for some reason give the task "Cook". Moreover the game has subtle and not so subtle flaws. For example when viewing your ship travelling through a solar system you can swivel the camera around the ship. If you do this you will realize the background is simply the inside of a sphere rotating around the ship. This means that if you see the ship from one side it looks like it is moving forward. Seen from the front it will look like it is going sideways and from the other side it will look like it is going backwards.\n\nGood idea, poor execution. Not worth the asking price.","August 13, 2015","false","17.2"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","4","7","0","1"

Im putting this review as positive because it is a game worth buying or waiting for until its completed. However as some other negative reviews say, there are a lot of bugs, menus overlapping and dispearing things is a bit of a problem. Iv also found it quite confusing about the trading part of the game as im never sure what each planet wants and doesnt want.  The tutorial could be improved by being a little clearer with instruction or a first time walk through each menu ect. Having said this negative stuff, it is a really lovely looking game and  has some nice humour in it as well as what looks like some great game play once youv got started and know what your doing.

I understand it's an attempt at humor but it wore my patients thin, and now I hate all robot birds.\n\nThe look and feel is great, a scifi game with silly characters designs reminds me of the classic Space Quest franchise.\n\nThe gameplay is fun (never tried combat) but as you explore new solar systems to trade in, you realise they all look the same. Each station has the exact same characters and you never feel like you're in a difference part of the galaxy. The world shouldn't feel small in a game like this.\n\nManaging your ship, and trying to keep the angry hipster crew happy is also fun. The main drive of playing was to get a better ship with more room, after a buying a few ships I felt no incentive to continue playing.\n\nI only gave it 10 hours, maybe there is more to the game that I missed.\n\nI'd recommend this game if it's on sale.

All it takes is one failed mission and you go into negative balance.  Once you have a negative balance it's next to impossible to climb out of it because you don't have any money to buy any trade goods and many missions even require you to buy something before you can deliver it.  They need to dramatically expand the missions to allow more safe options for building income when you have a negative or low balance.         The missions are so poorly created right now that I literally could only accept about 1 out of 20 missions and most of those were illegal and resulted in just losing even more money.

For those not familiar with Space Colony (in which case you're missing a treat) it's a micro-management city builder with some fairly basic but well-developed Sims dropped in - give them what the need and they'll mostly look after themselves, but you still need to intervene to keep them friendly (and more) towards each other, and occassionally to restore their sanity. The first couple of missions are a bit clunky as the game wants you to know that this is important stuff, but later on you're so pushed for time building your base, and managing resources, plant life and alien incursions, that keeping a happy crew becomes both a challenging and enjoyable element of the game. And as well as the two-pronged (civil / military) split campaign you get a good variety of challenge maps and an editor in the package.\n\nUnfortunately this may have set my bar rather high.\n\nCosmonautica is more like the Sims meets Pirates!, but it doesn't quite hit the mark, and now I've played enough of it I'm realising why, and it's fundamental flaw is in pandering too much to casual gaming. The (single) campaign starts out promisingly enough but it falls down in a few key areas.\n\nThe crew management is essentially limited to picking the right team (tip: make sure they all eat the same food and don't promote them beyond level 2 until they can at least sleep, eat, wash, exercise, play games and take pills and they'll never fall out or complain about anything). The biogs are nice but very short, which wouldn't matter were it not for the fact that the game offers hardly any opportunities for them to stand out individually.\n\nThe ship battles are also disappointing, and even more so because it wouldn't take much to fix them. Here Cosmonautica really wants to be Pirates!, but the touch-friendly interface (with no keyboard controls) limits manouvering to basic commands (circle left / right, etc) and Pirates! fans will be bashing their cursor pads in frustration. Without better controls battles basically amount to working out whether to fight or flee, and then slowly getting close enough to begin playing whack-a-mole with command icons until the other ship gives up or blows up. Battles just aren't fun, and all it needed to do was copy Pirates!\n\nAnd finally there's the downtime when travelling between planets. Even if there was much to the crew management, travelling in normal time would bore you to death, and travelling in fast time doesn't give you a big enough gap to think through and make any decisions. So trips are reduced to the sort of 20-30 second turn times you'd complain about on a turn-based strategy.\n\nIn short, Cosmonautica is a missed opportunity. I've not completed it yet so have no idea how far in I am, but I've got myself a nice cruiser and unlocked all the science upgrades except for whatever's left of the galaxy hexes, and I'm going to finish the campaign and probably grind my way to buying a top tier ship, but with only a sandbox as an alternative to the campaign I'm not sure I'll be coming back afterwards.\n\nIt's still very polished, and as one of the more involving casual games it's fun, but put it up against even an old RTS or trader and you'll soon see its flaws.","August 24, 2015","true","32.4"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Let me just say I love trading and economics games in general, thats why I bought this game. So if you are like me, you should probably heed my words as you probably are as stingy with the quality as I am when it comes to these genres.\n\nThe game had/have some potential but due to following cons, its a no-go:\n1. The game gets repetitive quite fast. (No, Im sorry, REALLY FAST)\n2. The combat is slow, uninspiring and contentless. Or at least the content is both boring and slow.\n3. The trading is simple, though easy, and lacks any kind of immersion. (kinda important as this is a trading game?)\n4. Bugs, they are everywhere and you never know when, who, what or how they will crawl up across your screen to destroy your gameplay, immersion or even your ability to play the game at all.\n5. Content... roughly 10 ships or something to choose from. Tradingships, battleships and some ships in somewhere in the middle. Now that may seem enough to some, to me it was just a couple of hours of gameplay.\n6. The game world is extremly simple, boring and random without any clue of logic.\n\nSo what about the pros?\nAre they really necessary when I dont even consider them enough to recommend someone to play this game?

Can't trasfer saves to another device.\n- The Ipad version is not optimized and bogs down performance if you have too many crew.\n\nI realize the ipad knock isn't a steam thing, but I felt it important to note because I bought this game (twice!) so I could pass my saves back and forth and that just doesn't work.","August 6, 2015","false","5.6"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","1"

Let me just say I love trading and economics games in general, thats why I bought this game. So if you are like me, you should probably heed my words as you probably are as stingy with the quality as I am when it comes to these genres.\n\nThe game had/have some potential but due to following cons, its a no-go:\n1. The game gets repetitive quite fast. (No, Im sorry, REALLY FAST)\n2. The combat is slow, uninspiring and contentless. Or at least the content is both boring and slow.\n3. The trading is simple, though easy, and lacks any kind of immersion. (kinda important as this is a trading game?)\n4. Bugs, they are everywhere and you never know when, who, what or how they will crawl up across your screen to destroy your gameplay, immersion or even your ability to play the game at all.\n5. Content... roughly 10 ships or something to choose from. Tradingships, battleships and some ships in somewhere in the middle. Now that may seem enough to some, to me it was just a couple of hours of gameplay.\n6. The game world is extremly simple, boring and random without any clue of logic.\n\nSo what about the pros?\nAre they really necessary when I dont even consider them enough to recommend someone to play this game?

I am really into the economics aspect of it. I travel through space carrying waste from an overpopulated planet to a planet that grows food and bam, money. I sell cigarettes to an outpost planet and swim in credits. Have to figure out what to research and when to keep the crew happy, decide how to make trips cost effective, and I hope to one day get a bigger ship! See boys, size does matter, and any woman who says otherwise is lying.\n\nIt's also a game I can keep on in the background while I am at work, and game throughout the day. I adore games like that. They don't run hot, they stay windowed in the background, and no sound is needed. Perfecto.\n\nThere are absolutely cons though. There's no manual save, only an autosave, so if you have one bad run, it can lose you hours worth of money. I read the developers did that on purpose, jerks.\n\nThe combat system I have yet to get the hang of. I figure I'll wait until I have a bigger ship and can load it with weapons and then I'll start fighting, so I have no real info there. It does remind me a bit of oldschool space shooters so far though.\n\nAnd why is it, there are times when it will take entire loops around the solar system to get to a planet that is directly next to me? That's one of the worst issues for me. Makes some missions totally worthless and I lose all my profit.\n\nI have also had the game crash twice in the 9 hours I've played so far. Apparently, from what I am reading, that makes me one of the lucky ones.\n\nAnd lastly, the missions get old. I feel like I am doing the same things, over and over.

But after putting a few hours into the campaign I just can't recommend this.\n\nTo start with, the research tree is horrible. You have to research the middle and outer rings to get to more planets in the same system. Why? Does my ship not have sensors? Do the stations not have starcharts?\n\nThe room research is the worst offender though. At some point, your crew is going to want shower. You have to research a bathrrom with a shower. So let me understand, we know how to build spacefaring ships but don't know how to include a shower in the bathroom? Or a kitchen, medbay, gym, etc. In my opinion, this is just stupid. All of the rooms should have been unlocked from the start and research should have been applied to upgrading the efficiency of your existing rooms.\n\nNext is travelling between planets. The pathfinding is mediocre at best and will do things that make no sense. I've had it where planets that were in the same wedge (think of the solar system divided into slices, like a pizza) but only 2 orbits apart take 7 days to travel...all because the pathfinding decided that my ship would fly counter-clockwise around the entire system instead of just doing a straight shot to the planet. Oddly enough, exiting the game and then reloading the save made the game recalculate the path to a still inefficient 4.5 days.\n\nCombat. I tried it once. On a 1 skull rated difficulty. Which turned into an utter failure. The lack of ability to manually control your flight path is a terrible decision. It would've been ok if there were more choices available to you. Right now, all you can do is close the distance, fly circles around your enemy (doesn't work well enough), and flee. Oh...there's an evade button you can use but all that does is move the ship to the side briefly. Which doesn't work well.\n\nThe game has potential but in its current state, that's all I can say about it. Wait for demo to try it out or for the price to be slashed during a sale if you're interested.","August 23, 2015","false","6.1"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","7","15","0","0"

So go play bloody FTL then....\n\nI rather like that this game has its own identity, its not trying to ripoff anything. One can state some aspects have similarities to other games, but then again the market of games is so broad, you can make a 8 bit pixel game in html and it will have similarities to a great many other games. So if your only frame of reference is other games you have played, and not your own vision and imagination, Then I rate your reveiw as thumbs down.\n\nThis game is as fun and quirky as you might hope at a glance. I have not seen any crashes at all yet despite what some are saying. The game is open world/sandbox in design, thankfully (something FTL wasn't i might add), you control all the basics of crew assignements, trading, intersteller navigating, and of course your ship. You only control them in broad terms however, so I find the game a more casual, and light hearted approach, and I think that suits this games design and style. You wont find to much micromangement, but enough to satisfy a moderate amount of Compulsive Disorder I think. It feels like they have some good balance at its present stage in development and great vision for its future stages.\n\nIf you wanna accelerate the pace and go pick a fight, you can.\nWanna settle down and have a snack whilst slowly zipping from one trade stop to another, you can.\nGetting bored watching your ship move around and wanna speed things up ? you can.\nDont like the way your medic is eyeballing you during your physical, and wanna fire him ? you can ! (there is no physical exams in the game by the way) *phew*\n\nIn short what I like most about this game is the open ended/sandbox playstyle. Its a fun and playful game, and you can get an excellent and complete taste of the game even in its early access stage. I found my initial playthrough was surprisingly fun, and i left feeling quite excited for this games future potential.\n\nI would emphatically recommend this game for its low price, in fact, once its fleshed out in the future, I would pay even more. Its what 12 bucks or something ? Sheesh stop reading these reveiws and buy it, i think most will be quite positively surprised.","July 21, 2015","true","33.7"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","47","7","15","2","0"

Right now, there are too many convenient losses that stack against your characters in terms of battles and quests.  Literally every single smuggling quest I have taken has resulted in contraband being found by customs, even when my hacking "camouflage" is over 80%.  Just by the sheer law of probability I should have skated through undetected at least a couple of times even without hacking skill.  Additionally, when you're carrying illegal goods there is always someone who engages a spacefight, even if there are no enemy ships in the vacinity - no ships of any kind in some instances.  Then, there's the problem with the bargaining system while fighting, which allows you to call the other ship and negotiate your peaceful surrender - you give them dough, they go on their merry. However, when you're carrying illegal goods, they confiscate these even if you pay them.  The pay is implied as being given in exchange for not boarding or attacking your ship, so why or how would they know those goods are there?  This game is infuriating, half because I like it so much and half because it isn't fun to play when there is no reason to take the big risks specifically because you will ALWAYS get caught.  If this is fixed, this might become a great game, but until then I don't think I'll play anymore.","September 30, 2015","true","27.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

What you see is what you get, I admire how simplistic the game is - visually and mechanically.\n\nWhat do I like?\n\nEarly game is challenging, it keeps you constantly on the move and in search of more ways to find income and gives a sense of urgency to keep your ship maintained whilst also being a slow paced game\n\nMid Game is also interesting, it only takes about 3-5 hours to get in to the mid game (at least in my case) and from here there goes 3 different designs that go from being cargo to weaponry and one that is somewhere inbetween\n\nLate Game is somewhat dissapointing but I will come back to that in the final overview\n\n\nWhat do I not like?\n\nI am almost sure that I found an exploit accidentally, one that got me rich very quickly with hardly any effort - I won't explain it but it's pretty available everywhere you go\n\nbut what I was most dissapointed about is that - yes the crew do have relationships between each other but you NEVER see any kind of social interaction with any of the crew members unless you build special rooms and tell them to go there. I think late game would have benefited from having the crew being bigger and having interactions with each other\n\nbut overall, I'd really reccomend this to anyone who loves Arcade Style Simulation games.","August 12, 2015","true","15.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Fortunately, in only takes about 10 seconds to re-start, and you'll always come back to a fresh auto-save.\n\n~Travelling is a huge time-sink, and you'll be travelling every few minutes. Encouraging the player to get up and walk away from the computer every 3 minutes is a pretty substantial design flaw.\n\n~It doesn't have anything like an end-game.

Whether you trade, ferry passengers, do piracy or all three (which I'm sure many Firefly fans will) you'll turn into Malcolm Reynolds as you try to make money, whilst giving your crew work.\n\nIt's the lovechild from an orgy of FTL, Freelancer, Redshirt and Firefly. Even though it is Early Access, it offers a lot already to warrent a purchase and your support.

And it is entertaining, especially at that price. I'd probably be grinding my teeth a bit if I'd paid full for it though.\n\nIt does suffer from both bugs and unpolished gameplay, but it is still fun to play. It crashes occasionally, but has so far always reloaded quickly with little loss of progress. It even seems to save more often than advertised "at every station". So the crashes are irksome but not serious as far as playing it goes.\n\nSome more annoying bits are a mission not completing when it detects the tasks out of order, differences between mission requirements and what you actually need for them, and flight paths suddenly changing and making you miss deadlines (particularly on longer ones). They are at least fairly minor though. Not being able to adjust the window size is also a minor annoyance, having it allways about 5 pixels wider than my screen.\n\nAlso you can sometimes manage the flightpath issue by selecting other destinations when it goes wrong (usually a huge loop out in front of the planets orbit when half way there) to force a course-change, then change back again. It requires some micro-management.\n\nShip and tech progression don't match well and it's very easy to run on with the storyline then realise you've progressed yourself into an unwinable situation. Ship combat also isn't well explained. It does feel like it's missing its final polish.\n\nThe way you manage your crew however is very nice and creative with the morale system, and when you do upgrade your ship it is fun kitting it out. Building up a ship is rewarding, especially once you start stacking multiple jobs for destinations.\n\nSo despite its flaws, it's still a fun game. Get it while it's cheap.","April 30","true","20.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

However, after playing the game for 12 hours, I must say that the gameplay mechanics are huge disappointments because they seriously lack tactical depth and variety.\n\nThis game is mainly composed of 2 gameplay components: 1) space combat and 2) interplanetary trading. The mechanics of these 2 components, unfortunately, are completely broken.\n\nFirst of all, for space combat, I can simply use 2 words to summarize it: Use torpedoes. That's it. I'm not kidding. You just need to equip your space ship with tons of torpedoes and you'll win every space combat in this game. Don't waste your time and money on other types of weapons.\n\nFor space trading, I can just use 4 words to summarize it: Trade high-priced goods. That's it. The profits from trading expensive goods are so high that there's literally no reason at all to trade mid- and low-priced commodities in this game.\n\nSo, if you want to be successful in Cosmonautica, it's just very very simple: use torpedoes (in combats) and trade high-priced commodities (in trading). The gameplay mechanics are just overly simplistic and broken. Honestly, after playing this game for about 5 hours, I already got very bored. I kept playing for another 7 hours because I didn't want to waste my $15 spent on the game. I wish the new Steam refund policy had been in effect when I bought this disappointing title.\n\nConclusion: Cosmonautica has beautiful graphics, but its gameplay mechanics fail miserably.\n\nMy review score: 5/10","August 5, 2015","false","12.2"," 10 of 22 people (45%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","45","10","22","0","1"

Definitely not for everyone; while it does have a very primitive combat interface it’s essentially a resource management sim.  I love simulation type "games" and mini/max micro management, so I was completely addicted immediately.  It actually reminds me somewhat of Galactic Civ.\n\nI also like that it is a very focused, solid game. It is an un-abashed, un-apologetic space trading and resource management sim. i.e. a very targeted, niche type game and it doesn't tack on random elements from other types of games trying to appeal to a wider market...all without taking itself too seriously.\n\nThat said, be warned that its very obvious that Comonautica is still on it initial shake-down cruise, however the autosave is so transparent and well implemented that I've never lost more than 2 or 3 minutes of play.\n\nPROS\nVery polished, if quirky, artwork.\nEach crew member is an indevidual with personal traits.\nVarious "missions" in addition to pure trading.\nMultiple planetary system types and industries.\nVery unique, "orbital" movement system.\nInteresting tech system.\nLarge number of inter-dependant industries and resources.\nAdult, Geek themed humor.\nSolid, focused "game" play.\nMassive potential for greatness.\nCONS\nThe "campaign" is woefully short and has exactly zero re-play potential.\nIt's a management sim.

I don't often pay full price for games not in a bundle or sale, but the early access game price is reduced and liked the look of the graphics and idea of having a simpler space trading game, asnd the graphics are really nice. There is a story mode, which is not yet complete but I found playing the story mode more fun than playing the game sandbox where it started to get a bit repetitive. The game did crash on me several times in the space battle part and graphics also glitched once making it difficult to play (have a high spec PC here with up to date drivers so games rarely crash on me), however still playable with an erection. I found it ammusing the ships could pilot themselves without a pilot at the wheel, and a few other quirks means the game does still need a fair bit of tweaking and balancing. I will probably wait until some more updates or the finished game is released before trying it again, and get a feeling the game will still have limited playability before getting reptitive, but if everything is perfected the limited playability could be really fun which is fine by me.","January 21, 2015","true","5.3"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

The trading aspect provides a balanced build-up and the volumn of ships and trade goods provides more than just a few hours of fun.\n\nAs I said before, there are bugs.

Unless you enjoy FTL type games where 90% of the gameplay is luck based, you'll just end up frustrated.  I've played 4 games in a row, every single one ending in failure due to some form of bad luck and lack of information.  For example, the last one.  Trying to get some early game money, still trying to fill spots on my crew with very limited cash.  I take a 1 skull mission to kill a pirate.  Right before the fight, one of the many ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ random events makes my repairman destroy one of my rooms then leaves them sick with a hangover.  Fight starts and I can't repair anything.  I also find out that my newly installed turret can't even scratch the enemy.  I retreat from the fight, and get docked $1500 for a failed mission.  Take the loss, try to recover.  Get a speeding ticket for $2500.  Try to recover again?  Don't have enough money left to invest in trade to make profit.  Try to sell pieces of ship to start over?  Does matter, crew is tantrum spiraling.  Money goes into negative, impossible to recover.\n\nThe game is all about having enough money to make money.  But you quickly find out you can't reliably make money in the beginning, as the only forms of trade that can actually make profit (Such as computers) don't restock/empty fast enough to be continually used (at least in the Tutorial campaign).  This forces you into relying on missions for reliable income, which aren't as reliable as you'd think. Almost all item shipping missions seem to be smuggling with 50+/-% failure rates (you actually lose money and waste time each time you fail).  Having a hacker in your crew might help offset this, but I never got the chance to test it due to expenses.  NPC transport missions require you to take up extra room on your already tiny ship with passenger seats, which with the already lack of money and space, may be difficult to aquire/fit.  Pirate killing missions require a good weapons/shield setup (as above mentioned), which is expensive early game and again, takes up lots of ship room.\n\nEtc etc, long story short, TL;DR:  My experience was extremely frustrating and I would never recommend this, or any other Luck based game, to anyone.  Any strategy/simulation/eyecandy/humor the game has, feels masked by the potential of bad luck being able to just end your game at any time, wasting hours of grinding.  Not my cup of tea.","November 18, 2014","false","5.3"," 4 of 13 people (31%) found this review helpful","31","4","13","0","3"

Mostly you will watch them walk around, and walk around, and walk around...\n\nThe tutorial is utter crap.  The interface is hopelessly (and needlessly) complex, and many of the control choices are just silly.  Hint to the clueless, tooltips, everything should have them.\n\nIt's not worth the purchase IMO.","August 2, 2015","false","0.8"," 2 of 9 people (22%) found this review helpful","22","2","9","0","0"

Unfortunately it doesn't do either very well.\n\nCombat is nothing like FTL; it is very slow paced compared to FTL. At the start of combat, you have to wait for your ship to reach the opponent, and whatever tactical selection you make takes some time to take effect. For example, if you decide to circle your opponent after ramming them, you face an agonising wait while your ship slowly pulls out of range and circles the enemy ship.\n\nOutside of combat, there really isn't anything interesting. It's just a simple trading mechanic to get more money to upgrade and unlock new stuff. You can't do anything when your crew is manning the ship. You can't make them talk, you can't make them eat more if they are still hungry. None of your actions have a direct impact on the crew.\n\nOh, and the mouse lag is really really annoying.","January 11, 2015","false","1.9"," 3 of 14 people (21%) found this review helpful","21","3","14","0","6"

This game still needs some love and polish, and iterative playtesting, but since I'm actually enjoying myself playing it I have to recommend it.\n\nThe good: it's fun to recruit a crew, train them up to be an efficient fighting machine, and travel the cosmos in search of fun and profit. This game gets those basics right. And the presentation is absolutely charming. And the solar systems use simple orbital mechanics! As a Kerbal Space Program player that's pretty damn awesome to see.\n\nThere are some problems that stop the game short of true greatness. Aside from the storyline missions, the gameplay is rather repetitive. When you've seen one system, you've seen them all, especially if you're a combat vessel rather than a trader. There are only a handful of basic missions, and you see the same ones over and over again.\n\nThere are also some balance/tuning issues that need to be addressed.\n\nFor one thing, fighting other vessels produces OUTRAGEOUS profit, far beyond anything else. This is because when you're beating the enemy they hail you to surrender and offer money and cargo to let them live. That money is always much, much higher than any possible mission reward you were getting to fight them. A simple bounty mission might be around 7,500 credits, while the ransom is likely to be 42,000!\n\nTrading still doesn't produce much profit unless you go for the higher value goods. That's fine, except that when you sell goods to a station they remain in that station and slowly disappear over time (as the inhabitants use them up, presumably). The problem is that this decay rate is far too slow. You end up stuffing the planet full of goods and unable to sell because everyone is still working their way through the last batch. Basically, you have to sell to planets other than ones that actually have a demand for your goods, and I'm reasonably sure that you could glut a whole system without much trouble.\n\nSome of the crew roles simply aren't useful, ditto ship rooms. There's a galley that requires a cook to operate, but the starting food vending machine is more than adequate for a full crew, and by the time you've researched the tech for the galley it's a simple matter to research the upgrade that makes the galley operate without a cook. Since upgrades are done by researching a technology, and that technology is used by different unlocks or upgrades, it's quite easy to inadvertently unlock automating the galley because you unlocked the prereq techs for other benefits they unlock.\n\nSame story with medics/medbay - the pill dispenser works just as well, doesn't require training, and the medbay gets automated by upgrades.\n\nCrew preferences and interactions is a nice idea in theory but it's simple enough to get crewmates who all like the same food and then you never have to worry about it again.\n\nThere isn't enough different mission text, so missions will repeat constantly. It's a very minor quibble, but it gets annoying reading the same description over and over and over.\n\n\nBasically, the game isn't balanced. The result is there's no real incentive to do anything other than what is most effective (ie, fight ships for outrageous ransoms). In a way you're punished for taking alternate approaches because they're so dismally ineffective by comparison.\n\nIt feels like this game has tremendous potential that could be unlocked by gameplay tuning. This would turn it from a "pretty good" game to an amazingly fantastic one. That said, it's still a pretty good game, and you should get it.\n\n-----------------------------\nOLD, EARLY ACCESS REVIEW:\n\nCharming presentation and shows great promise, but needs more work on gameplay tuning before it's actually fun to play. Cargo trading, for example, produces barely any profit.\n\nThis has every sign of becoming an excellent game, but it's not there yet, so I can't really recommend it (unless you just want to support them). The issues are easy enough to fix by simple iterative playtesting and balancing, so I don't expect this will stay a problem in the future.","January 26, 2015","true","18.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","3"

I can recommend the game now in its current state and right now believe it will get better over time. This game has heart and the devs have heart =).\n\n- Game play is the still same as before, but I've noticed more quests than the were before. So that means gameplay has been worked on.\n- Bugs seem to be gone. Performance is improved.\n- Proper PC resolution that demonstrates the artstyle of this game.\n- Multiple technical and gameplay updates since launch.\n\nSome annoying bits.\n- UI still needs work. Buttons and labels look exactly like text at times.\n- When negotiating with an enemy, how do i know if my deal makes sense? I want his cargo of wine e.g. but I'm not going to remember the price of a unit of wine cargo. I don't think the devs want the game to be this hardcore.\n\n(Also I noticed there are finally humans of different races.
