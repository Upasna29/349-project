I will not rant, either. I have played the game and I like it; the complexity, micro-managing and pace are fine by me (except you either get declared war on by everybody immediately or nothing happens at all).\n\nHOWEVER, I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this game for a very simple reason: It's incomplete, and thus borders on a SCAM; at the very least, it reflects poorly on BattleGoat's business ethics.\n\nThis game (main game and addon) was supposed to receive additional attention after release, adding several more features (including a fallout/radioactivity and an environmental impact system). The game did indeed receive several content updates and additional features but, sadly, BattleGoat abandoned the game before the addition and/or revision of several critical features, leaving the game with a stupid AI, pretty damn buggy and, worst of all, content incomplete (which shows - there are buildings, designs, research that are completely pointless because the corresponding parts of the game were never implemented).\n\nI therefore recommend that you avoid this game (and other games from BattleGoat) at all cost. This game is basically a polished Alpha and if the devs couldn't be bothered to finish this game, even after people already bought it, they are not worth your attention. Business practices like that should not be condoned or supported, so think twice before you buy from them - There may very well be a better, finished game out there.\n\n\n\nEDIT: Since one of the devs commented on this 'review' (and my full response doesn't fit in a single comment), I will add his statement and my response to it to the 'review' itself.\n\nchrisahl [developer] wrote:\n"Many statements in this review are completely false. The game received multiple updates for approximately 18 months after release of the core game including the life cycle of the expansion pack. The game is no buggy, it is one of the most stable titles on the market. I'll hold it up to anything else out there. Features such as radioactive fallout where never promised and many never promised features were added. The content was also completed with multiple campaigns and scenarios. The tech tree is complete containing hundreds of technologies to research. Unit designs are all buildable and as usable as their specs warrant."\n\n\n\nI don't know what game you're talking about, Chris, but it's not this game.\n\nI played it a lot more than my record says, and there are few games that have crashed so often on me as this one (which is why I eventually stopped playing when you guys announced that you were moving on - it got to the point where it was simply not enjoyable because the game became more unstable [and lost a lot of performance] as the world progressed and units were built). And that happened pretty much in every session because, of course, you need an army to get stuff done. For what it sets out to do, the game is not nearly optimized enough - and that's not great but we can chalk that up to a lack of experience if we want to be nice about it.\nThat, however, does not apply to the crashes. Those are bugs (unless you want to call it a feature?) and gamebreaking bugs that are left in the game at the end of its lifecycle (which is technically not over since Steam allows you to still make some sales) are not exactly a sign of good business ethics.\n\nAs for fallout and environment: You can say they weren't "promised", great. And I realize that I implied that you didn't add anything to the game (which I have rectified), which is unfair. But it still doesn't reflect positively on the development team when they obviously intended to implement it, put in some elements (and adjusted tooltips to hint at this feature and tell the player what he'd need this building or that research for), then decided "Oooh, lets do this, this and this first" instead of delivering on what was already halfway done and, finally, announced that they were done with the game when there were still a lot of loose ends. The least you can do is go through it and remove the redundant content.\nYes, that would have been extra work for you guys when you were eager to create your Cold War version of this, but it would have been at least an attempt at making it look like you were sorry about it.\n\n(As for the other things you mentioned [campaigns, tech tree, units]... Well, I don't really know why you did. I didn't put their existence into doubt and their being there doesn't change that some other features simply did not receive enough attention.)","May 11, 2014","false","45.3"," 127 of 173 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","127","173","2","27"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Terra162/recommended/25910/","Terra162","[ANGC] Morru Qu'aan, Terra162.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Terra162/","1166 products in account","Supreme Ruler 2020 Gold is the combined product of Supreme Ruler 2020 and Global Crisis.\nProduced by Battlegoat Studios and published by Paradox Interactive. (R1)\nIt is the child of the former *Supreme Ruler 2010 and It has expanded on the original game. (R2)\n\nNote, please go to the bottom for a TLDR summary.\n\n1. Introduction\n\nThere are 3 game modes.\n\n● Campaign\n● Sandbox\n● Scenario\n\nCampaign and sandbox are more or less the same.\nIf you have decided to play a campaign, you are presented with 3 campaigns to pick from World 2020, Global Crisis and Shattered World. (You can mod in more if you wish.)\nOnce you have selected your campaign you can chose from 182, 184, and 248, respectively.\n\nYou can play as the Superpower of the United States or the weakest of minor powers Malawi.\nin World 2020 and Global Crisis.\nOr\nYou can play as a state in the former United States or a sec of former Russia in Shattered World.\nThere are a lot of nations to choose from, just depends on how you wish to play.\n\n\nScenario, as its name implies, has a goal to complete within a given deadline.\n\nNow you're given 3 main categories.\n\n● Supreme Ruler 2020\n● Global Crisis\n● Custom Scenario\n\nEach one has certain scenarios from their own time frame. Of course, Custom Scenario has only custom scenarios.\n\n2. Gameplay\n\nThe gameplay is quite unique. I have yet to find a game that does a real-time strategy like this, it's nice.\nLet's just say we are playing as South Carolina in the campaign Shattered World.\n\n2.1 Interface\n\n2.1.1 Top\n\nAt the top center of the screen we have the following; Treasury amount, nation played as, game menu, GPD/c, pause/play, game speed, time and date.\n\nAll of the above are just information except the time and game menu buttons.\n\n2.1.2 Bottom\n\nOn the left corner/center of the screen, you have a sidebar with tabs of various areas.\n\n● Land\n● Production\n● Research\n● Finance\n● State\n● Operations\n● Defense\n● Unit Command\n\nOnce you have selected one of these the left center/corner will show you the tab and the information related to it.\nHere you will have the option to change various sliders related to the tab you have selected. Or change the highlighted parts of the map.\n\nOn the right center/corner of the screen, you have your minimap and your email (notifications).\n\nYou will receive an email if there is anything of importance happening that the game thinks is important to you. You can change the settings for what you find important or not in the options menu.\n\n2.2 Economy\n\nAs South Carolina we have to get a production of coal and metal ore. If we don't we will go into a huge deficit as we are import loads of resources to supply our factories. So we have to build some Metal ore/Coal mines till the demand is met.\nBut, if we are not careful at how many we build we will have to start importing industrial goods, which cost us more money.\n\nThat is just one aspect of the economy. Before we go to war, we have to make sure that we have the proper supply coverage is provided, the military goods produced to feed our solders, and the unit of solders themselves are trained.\n\nIt's rather detailed and I have only covered the most basic idea behind the economics behind the game.\nI don't know the deepest secrets it offers as I have only played around 20 hours of the game.\n\n\n2.3 Research/Technology\n\nTo be able to build a clean energy building or improve your coal power plants must be researched. Even the equipment your solders use and missiles your planes fire must first be researched as well. (Unless the nation you're playing as starts with the technology.)\nResearching a technology is simple, it depends on the number of Research Centers you have and if you can afford to pay the employees.\n\nHere is a small list of the main technologies you can research.\n\n● Warfare\n● Transportation\n● Science\n● Technology\n● Medical\n● Society\n\nEach one is linked to the others in some way. Some are more beneficial than others. It's your job to find out which ones are better for your situation and goals than someone else.\n\n\nThere is also another type of research, Unit Design.\n\n● Army (Ground)\n● Naval (Sea bound)\n● Air Force (flying units)\n● Missiles (ammunition for missile for various land, air, and sea units)\n\nAll the categories above have multiple sub tabs in them for example the Army tab has,\n\n● Infantry\n● Recon\n● Tanks\n● Anti-Tank\n● Artillery\n● Air Defense\n● Transport\n\nWith all these options you can tailor the Army/Navy/Air Force however you wish.\n\n2.4 Warfare.\n\nWarfare is very limited to how long your economy can support it. And how fast you will win/lose the war depends on the technology you have researched. It requires strong supply lines, some planning, and a bit of luck.\n\nAfter you go to the State tab you can conduct negotiations with other nations, or just declare war.\nAlthough, just being aggressive will make you get kicked out of the UN and other nations a valid casus belli.\n\nOnce you have a valid reason to go to war or you just declared it. You may now order your units to attack and cross the enemy’s borders and slowly moving your nation’s borders over the claimed territory. The map is made of small hexes so it is rather detailed on the terrain you can claim.\n\nEach unit has a condition bar which shows you the state they are in and how much manpower they have. If the bar is red you are likely out of supplies. If it is almost empty the unit will soon be destroyed because of the lack of men in the unit.\n\nWarfare is like Economics, it has some great details to it. I just cannot do justice explaining all of it.\n\n3. Conclusion.\n\nI enjoy the game very much. But, the only thing that I find to be a large drag is the fact time moves so slowly even on the highest speed setting. The highlight of the game is the complexity and details they made for us to conquer the world with.\nThis is a wonderful game I enjoy that is made by Battlegoat. It’s a great buy, especially for any real-time grand strategy game fans.\n\n4. My Game Scores and Reasons behind them. TLDR; Look here.\n\nGameplay                7/10\nThe game play is amazingly depth. Before you can even think about going to war you must first stablise your economy, have a surplus income, and research and produce the units to attack. I believe that this game delivers the "Conquer the world or die trying" idea really well.\n\nMusic/Sounds           4/10\nSounds are nice, they go well with it. They just get repetitive after a while of playing. Just like most other games of this category. Music as well, but that can be fixed with anything you want it to be thanks audio players!\n\nCreativity                 8/10\nA nice and original idea to the real-time grand strategy games are. The creative depth and research that was put into the game was amazing.\n\nGraphics                   5/10\nOkay graphics for a game made in 2008. I suppose if they were much better than they are most computers at that time couldn't handle all the calculations the computer has to make.\n\nReplay Value            6/10\nThe replay value of this game is really dependent on the player, for me it's a good bit. But it's still dependent on my ability to set a goal. So it will be yours as well, as I cannot set goals for you.\n\nEnjoyment               8/10\nI enjoy this game and I can see myself coming back to it at least for a hour or 2 each week. Who knows, might even play it for a few hundred hours.\n\nOverall                      6/10\nThis game has a lot of potential that is only limited to the players' want to conquer the world and how you want to do it. Diplomacy, War, and Economic Supremacy, but at the end of the day, it's still a war game.\n\n!!Funny, I hit the charactor limit.!!\n\nReferences.\nR1 = http://www.paradoxplaza.com/press/2009/9/supreme-ruler-2020-gold-marches-out-to-retail\nR2 = http://www.battlegoat.com/supreme_2020_GOLD.php\n","November 26, 2013","true","20.6"," 53 of 61 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","53","61","0","1"

It goes so insanely deep with you having control over every little thing, and it's just astonishing how much you can really do. Scenarios, diplomacy, products your empire carries, imports/exports, and what's great is that most of that you don't even have to keep doing yourself, because your advisors can take care of most of it (With some guidance, of course. Don't make that economic advisor bond your nation to debt now...) And with how much you can do in the military! It's great being able to micromanage everything. Plus, it's real-time, and all the wars happen at once. There's no turns like in the other games like Civ, and you can really do a lot at once. And, if you really love global RTS, you get all the nations, plus some scenarios to make the world even more varied than before, like a "Shattered world" map. If you don't want to take the time to learn it, then of course you'll hate it.

Unlike Victoria 2, the ultimate goal of this game is world conquest, that is your goal, but don't just invade countries willy nilly now, that's rather stupid. You have to take it slow and plan far ahead, that's what I like about this game, not to mention the research and trade systems. Seriously, have you ever sent the United States 1,100,000 barrels of oil in exchange for top notch military designs? Seriously oil is worth more then money in this game, the game is somewhat predictable, if your Russia and playing the Global Crisis scenario, China will usually invade you, but things can happen differently, depending on factors such as your military production, because a nation can become rather hostile to you out of fear of your military, it's a very indepth, somewhat complex, but yet surprisingly easy to learn, rousing goodtime of a Grand Strategt RTS.","March 15, 2014","true","100.3"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","17","19","0","0"

But the core problems with the franchise remain.\n\nBasic gameplay is excruciatingly slow; the fastest speed is a tenth of where it should be. Virtually every game mechanic is completely opaque, and zero effort is made to explain any of it. The economic model is absurd and way too easily exploited - even playing as Malawi (the poorest, most technologically backwards country in the world)  I can turn it into an economic powerhouse in just a few game years.\n\nSince no effort is made to balance the various countries, conflicts are rather pointless. The AI is terrible no matter how difficult you make the settings. You have to make your own game objectives because the game itself has none.\n\nThen there's the "engineers" problem - if you lack the tech to build a really good infantry unit, engineers are a very strong infantry unit that can be built with no tech. Although very oddly you can't actually research the unit, you need to trade for the design - but anyone will trade it to you for some cash. The engineer has massive advantages - it's cheap, it can cross rivers, it can bridge terrain for other units, it can accelerate production and repair of buildings, and it can beat the tar out of far more advanced units without breaking a sweat. Why a zero-tech engineer can pound the hell out of many types of advanced infantry units is beyond me.\n\nThe economy and force distributions aren't the only wildly imbalanced aspects to the game. Research is ridiculous - if you have the cash you can buy and use techs way way way beyond your tech level. Diplomacy is virtually pointless, as is any other form of non-warfare interaction with other countries.\n\nThe UN mechanic is also dubious, there are no substantial benefits to being a part of the UN, and a significant economic penalty is attached to being good by them, when it should be the other way around. It's to your advantage to purposely get kicked out, so that you don't have to pay their escalating membership fees - for which you get nothing in return. An example of how trying to stay good by the UN hurts you: it's apparently perfectly acceptable for a neighboring country with whom you are not at war to allow passage of enemy units to attack your territory, but if you attack that neighbor for that act of war the UN will despise you for it.\n\nYour advisors are just as bad as the AI elsewhere; if you trust them to do anything they will mess it up badly. There's a system of implementing priorities for them, but if this has any actually effect on their behavior I haven't been able to detect it.\n\nThe only thing this game does well, gameplay-wise, is tactical unit management on the hex map. If you can slog through all the opaque mechanics and the gruelingly long setup time before a typical country can start invading others, that part is reasonably satisfying.\n\nOther mechanics, like the loyalty mechanic, are just stupid and appear to directly contradict the "realism" goal of the game. Either eliminate that mechanic, or do it properly!\n\nLike its predecessor, SR2020 is a great idea that doesn't really work well as implemented.","January 2, 2015","false","411.2"," 26 of 37 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","26","37","0","0"

And I am long standing fan of the series, starting SR2010, now playing SR1936.\n\nTo sum it up, my recommendation is positive, but, please, read more as there are few objections and e.g. Bjoern has quite a few valid points. I would not recommend this game to just anyone.\n\nThe game is very ambitious, wide in scope and quite complex with sharp learning curve. Of course you can assign some tasks to AI, but why let computer play my game? Especially as decisions of AI advisors are often quite poor. In general, game more or less delivers what it promises - choose any country and run it as you wish in global environment.\n\nHowever, there is quite a feel of unfinisheness in some aeas. I think the scope of project was too wide to deliver within set  budget and timeframe. Quite a few ideas are implemented only partially or got axed in full (NBC, environment, tourism and business centers... )\n\nNow, to cover aspects of the game:\n\nResearch: there are several hundreds of technlogies and units in technology tree, but their effect is very often "research and forget" without any significant effect. Still, quite a few technologis do have very visible effect. As for the units, you can do well enough with lets say 7 units for most of the game (see warfare). Researching hundreds of unit models covered in game is marginally interesting. Tech level is a bit strange concept - it is possible to have tech level of year 1990 and run phaser hover  tanks...\n\nDiplomacy is quite strange (but I fail to recall any 4X game with really working diplomacy model, and I played many of them - Galciv probably got closest). E.g. casus belli is mostly based on active unit production capacity which gives way to many exploits (as AI is unable to control this aspect), but you will always face up "all computer coalition" in the end. However, I find diplomacy no better or worse than in any 4X game.\n\nEconomy is based (I believe) on Joseph Stiglitz theories. General idea is the more government spends, the better economy performs. Economy view aside, this leads to not very realistic in game strategies and exploits. It is very easy to start as - e.g. - Madagascar and triple GDP/c in a year. Moreover, there is very nasty bug related to price mechanism which I will cover later. I do feel economy to be somewhat ovrsimplified, but working (but mind you, I am economy geek :) ).\n\nWarfare is acceptable. Building few hundreds of APC (preferably laser ones) and several naval transports is enough to conquer the world. Everything else is just nice to have. Long range AA and fighters helps limit APC loses against air powers, few dozens of stealth srategy bombers (B-2) are great to override entranched aeas. I found very limited use for tanks, and no use for AT, Recon, most naval units, range AA and most of the aircrafts... There is just no real need to build these types of units. AI does its job to provide resistence, but is by no means real oponent.\n\nAs for the nasty, game and save breaking bug I mentioned before... Using artifical production buildings (like synth fuel factory) does increase the final product price. This has positive feedback to output price of buildings which use his product as input (e.g. oil power plant), especially, if it the only input. If ANY country manages to create "closed circle" - like most of the oil produced in synth fuel plant, most of the electricity (used in synth fuel plant) produced in oil power plant - prices will get out of any reasonable range. GDP skyrockets and after several weeks treasury of this country will get out of range which game can handle. This destroys world market and after another few weeks, population gets out of control (not sure if by standard game mechanisms or the data just get overwritten). The game is not salveable in this state. There are workarounds (either conquer the country before it gets there - only handful of countires can get into this loop), or casually check the countries and if they start going this way, load one month old save in multiplayer mode and destroy these buildings. BTW, with careful handling this bug can be used as exploit to get unlimited treasury. The most usual culprit is Moscow, by the year 2029. IMHO this bug should not have escaped testing. Apart of this bug, I found game stable, if resouce hungry.\n\nTo sum it up, even as I highlighted some negatives, my overall feeling of the game is positive and - as I bought it for 22 euros and now just added to my steam collection for 2.5 - one of the best values for a buck despite its flaws. I would not hesitate to recommend buy for any global 4X games fan, who can handle limits of the game. And I hope Batlegoat will continue to improve the engine as Paradox did with Europe Univrsalis or HoI.","July 19, 2014","true","521.9"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

So what is this super-duper game then?\n\nYou can take any country in the world (even Andorra, never even knew that existed, its between France and Spain) and command it economically and politcally and militarily. But the best thing is that for once IT IS SET IN THE PRESENT, which makes it more intriguing. No longer are there obvious antagonist states such as Japan Germany or the USSR. You have to make them powerful. Obviously there is North Korea, absoloutely a must play. and China and Russia who are fun to play as. The real excitment lies in playing as Britain or France and attacking europe.\n\nGraphically it is incredibly intense, maybe not in the same way as battlefield (the water is terrible), but displaying litterally TENS OF  THOUSANDS  of units can destroy your computer.\n\nYou can also play with real life military units. They are much better than some games (the sort that have light medium and heavy tanks) in that you can take american aircraft carriers and Russian tanks and then throw them into battle so it is one enormous, accurate, set of toy soldiers.\n\nWhat could be better?","May 11, 2015","true","21.4"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","6","7","2","1"

(Or local dominance if you don't want to get sucked up in a really long match.) The challenge in the game is turning your nation into the best by correcting a faltering economy, and by creating an army that no other can hope to challenge. I used to recommend not getting this on Steam, but there's absolutely no reason to avoid getting it on Steam since it was updated!

So if you want to just pick up the game and go this might not be for your average strat player, it's stylized along the same lines as the old school WW II games which does indeed involve strategy and a lot of planning to "acquire" your neighbor's territory.

This game had the potential to be an extremely in-depth geopolitical grand strategy game. Instead, it is a hollow game about military conquest and making money, masked by a clutter of interface options all showing stats of little to absolutely no significance.\n\nThis game also feels as if the developers were currently working on a feature, and decided "HEY! Lets add this!" and completely forgot about the task at hand, or could not be bothered to finish said task. A prime example would be the environment system. You may think, "Why, there is none!" and you would be mostly right, however with many Society technologies, they all have to do with the environment, and some even have to do with nuclear fallout (another thing that is not to be seen). And some of the techs say, in the "effects" portion of the tech, "Environmental rating +x%". Well, why would they say it has these effects even though most of these techs dont do anything? Well, the answer is simple. The developers were working on environmental effects to your actions and the actions of other nations, and these technologies would help the global environmental situation. And by hints from the technology, nuclear fallout would be an issue too. However, the developers either did one of two things. They either thought "lets put this in, and this, and this" but never went back to the task at hand (as I said earlier) or had a hard time creating these systems (which I imagine would be complicated) and gave up completely. Not even bothering to remove the technologies that talk about environmental impact, blah, blah, blah.\n\nAlso, many (probably a majority) of the technologies have literally no impact. It is literally useless fluff put into the game and branded with a sign saying "THIS DOES SOMETHING" however, it doesnt. Yes, I grant you there are also MANY technologies that do a lot, however if you look at the grand strategy games put out by Paradox Interactive, every single technology has a large impact and is essential.\n\nAnd all in all, this game is largely unfinished. The developers did update it years ago, however they still left behind the game, and left it very hollow indeed. They moved on to create THREE new titles, all as hollow as this, but with a shiny new interface, map, and a better AI (which is TERRIBLE in 2020, by the way).\n\nSure, this game can be fun to play even now. However the bad practices that Battlegoat has proceeded with for 4 games (Not sure about SR2010) should not go unnoticed. Practices such as, leaving behind an unfinished game, using said unfinished features and leaving them in other titles (environmental impact "modifiers" still implemented in their SR titles to date). I would also rant about how they pulled Supreme Ruler Ultimate from Early Access and "releasing" it in an extremely unfinished state, however I have a review on that game for you already.\n\nAll in all, I would not reccoment anybody to support the bad practices Battlegoat has gone through with many times, and I urge you to turn away from this game and have a look at Paradox Interactive's titles instead. They are very finished, always releasing updates, finishing their games, and have many features. I am sorry Battlegoat but I despise games being left unfinished. Especially 4 games in a row. I would be weary when thinking of buying a game from this company in the future.","January 3, 2015","false","26.4"," 12 of 21 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","12","21","0","0"

While it suffers from a difficult learning curve and can be slow as hell once the number of units increases, for long-term Grand Strategy addicts the degree of complexity this game provides is a sheer joy. It's also a few years old, and already some of the "near future" features feel like the past, but this doesn't mar the game as much as increase the entertainment value.\n\nThis Gold edition also includes some really excellent mods that expand the game in many ways, including some very good tech tree mods that extend the potential time period by quite a way. The AI is competent enough to challenge the player; not terrifyingly good like AI War, but certainly able to keep up.\n\nAll told: an excellent game for fans of vast quantities of detail.","November 30, 2014","true","125.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Then came the civ series. But Supreme Ruler is the pinnacle of the genre. I bought SR2020 several years ago and I keep coming back. I have bought many games on Steam that I have yet to play because of this masterpiece. The intracacies of managing every aspect of a nation in a world plunged into regional conflicts is delightfully frustrating.","March 5","true","316.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's almost impossible to figure out how to load units onto boats to fight across the ocean. very little help exists outside of the game, as people explain the apparent and obvious reasons it doesn't work.  I need to know why it doesn't work when everything seems like it should.  Like why sometimes i can load troops onto transport ships, and it says "40k ton vehicals fit!" and yet my 3k ton tank isn't allowed on.\nWars seem to go on forever, which is part of the fun.  Game is so close to being everything I was looking for, but large scale invasions are impossible, unless you want to take 3 hours of your time moving individual units onto air crafts and boats, and then have to deal w/ them not fitting even though it should.  The game is designed so you have to basically daisy chain supplies w/ your outgoing forces, while you build up reserves, so it's like they want you to make giant invasion forces, but make the process just so god awful.  Don't bother unless you're a fan of the series, because they didn't really change much.","April 19","false","42.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
