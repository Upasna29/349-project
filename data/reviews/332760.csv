Played again today with the kids -- four player couch co-op.  Super slow-mo mode is a lot of fun, and 200% mode is crazy fast.  In our family we use games like this to settle disputes -- if the kids can't agree on what movie to watch we have a Friendship Club battle, and the winner gets to choose!","March 27, 2015","true","0.8"," 26 of 27 people (96%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","96","26","27","6","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tohonas/recommended/332760/","Tohonas","Tohonas","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tohonas/","554 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nFriendship Club is a superb local multiplayer game; a colourful top-down arena shooter,  where 4 players control one of young Timmy Bibbleâ€™s best imaginary friends as they vie for his affection by shooting the crap out of each other.\n\nFull (pre-release) 4-player gameplay video here: http://goplaythat.com/2015/03/24/friendship-club-mp-gameplay/\n\nThe key gameplay mechanic is that inside each single-screen level, bullets fired will bounce off of every surface they hit until lodged into the head of one of the protagonists. Each starts with 3 bullets and other than that, have a dash move which acts as a shield, which if activated at the right time, will absorb oncoming fire to be used again.\n\nThe four playable characters are lovingly animated, vibrant and memorable, down to their fantastic names. Canardinal is the best character ever, and I love him/it!\n\nThe game is easily enough to be sold as a full product as it is, so don't be scared about the Early Access tag, there's more than enough to keep you entertained! There are only two levels at the moment, but they are procedurally generated, and the 7 modes available makes sure that every game is different.\n\nFriends, beer and Friendship Club. Sorted!","March 24, 2015","true","0.3"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","17","19","0","0"

I had three friends together and the hours flew by as we dodged, shot, and hid in the corners cowering like children in a bullet storm.\n\nThe greatest thing about the game is it brings back that old spark of having people physically present. Evoking the same tense, adrenaline-laced high you got from Halo LAN parties or Golden Eye shoot outs, Friendship Club has tight controls and a plethora of options that keep you yelling, cursing, and laughing in giddy glee as you shoot anything that moves.\n\nAnd although it's in early release, it's so polished I didn't even notice. The art style is slick, the music perfectly suited to the light atmosphere, and the mechanics are so well honed you'll finish a round and scream for another. It really is hard to pull yourself away.\n\nCouldn't recommend more highly.","March 25, 2015","true","0.1"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","6","7","2","0"

Pretty excited to see them! Make sure you have a controller though.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/PheGaWmaT9w\n\nI was provided early press access by Force of Habit.","March 24, 2015","true","1.9"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","7","10","0","0"

WHAT ISN'T TO LIKE?!\nI absolutely adore this game, it is worth every penny even in early access, it has multiple multiplayer modes, a load of different speeds, custom modes and all sorts of other fun stuff. They update it constantly too, so far really happy with the game. Plus, I've met the developers, they're so cool!","June 16, 2015","true","0.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

What else do you need?\n\nThe game has got everything you would ask for in a game... Except for an online mode, as you require to play with people next to you, but that is basically the point of the game. I loved the idea of calling the game "Friendship Club" when in reality it's about "killing" the other people.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thesero/recommended/332760/","thesero","Sero.ps","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thesero/","993 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nFirst played this game at a LAN event (Insomnia), and bought it as soon as I sat back at my pc. Good game, nice and friendly devs.\n\nGreat fun to play, with a good thought to modes and modifiers to give the game variety. Naturally everyone will end up with their own favourite mode. With the quick rounds and matches, it works very well with a large group, swapping controllers in and out among themselves, and makes a surprisingly fun spectator sport as well.\n\nDefinite recommend for anyone who can local game with mates.\n\nDo make sure you know what it is you're buying though, local play and controller controls only are the sort of things people will complain about if they're not expecting it. This would be understandable were both facts not clearly stated on the store page.","April 1, 2015","true","0.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I especially enjoyed Bullet Hell where the bullets literally never stop flying and Trick Shot where the game turns into a quick thinking vs. puzzle game.\n\nThe controls and menus are simple, colourful and perfectly pitched for a party game. The matches get crazy hectic and it really is a lot of fun.\n\nCan't wait for the introduction of the single player mode to iron out my strategies too!","April 8, 2015","true","1.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Each character has a melee attack, and a projectile. Depending on the mode the number and speed of projectiles may vary. The projectiles bounce infinately making maps crazy.\n\nThe gamemodes are reasonably limited at present - however the intention is that eventually players will be able to design their own gamemodes. A highly innovative approach.\n\nContent is currently quite limited, making the price tag a little high for those who are after a relatively complete game. However if you want to invest in the future of a strong game it is worth the buy.\n\nSubscribe to my curator page for more local multiplayer recommendations: http://store.steampowered.com/curator/7189360/\n\nCheck out my Couch Gaming group for specials, bundles, etc: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/CGLM","May 5, 2015","true","0.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Then this game is for you.\nI'll put in a disclaimer regarding this game though, the development of the game has been halted due to dev issues but it is still playable at its state.\n\nI have not played much of the game due to old controller issues, but I will definitely check back once I get hold of a new controller that is supported by the game. This game is definitely worth being played on a couch party.","February 11","true","0.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Friendship Club, without fail, takes me back to being a kid sitting on bedroom floors, playing games!\n\nI wouldn't normally recommend early access games, but Friendship Club is definitely amongst the more polished ones. It feels like a playable game rather than one pushed out far too early, and with regular updates its nice to see the game grow as the development continues!\n\nGreat art, great music, great gameplay.

Not actually played it on this yet (getting a controller soon) buut i played it at insomnia and love it :)   SUGGESTIONS-\n1. A singe-player gamemode where you play the computer\n2. Available on PS4 and XBOX1 (can't remember if you said you would do this)\n3. A wider variety of options on the custom level modded gametype\n4. Online play and local play (one person on one laptop/ console VS etc)\n5. A story mode\n6. Upgradable guns\n7. Hats or outfits to accessorise your character\n8. A map per character as one just for Old Man Rickets isn't fair.\nFrom Mivhael :)","April 5, 2015","true","3.7"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","1"

I was exprcting a great game going by the 100% positive reviews, but this was a disappointment.
