Mini Ninjas executes its charm offensive right from the opening credits as it plays out like one of the many Saturday morning cartoons I used to love to watch as a kid. What is even more surprising is that Mini Ninjas comes from the same studio that has built an empire out of anti-heroes. With Hitman and the Kane and Lynch series firmly under IO Interactive's belt, two very different franchises featuring characters with dubious lifestyles littered with sex, drugs, profanity and lots of merciless killing, Mini Ninjas ends up playing like a gentle breeze on a hot and muggy Saturday morning/afternoon. The closest the gamer is going to get to any kind of merciless killing in Mini Ninjas is enemies exploding in a colorful array of bubbles to reveal some poor wildlife animal that the games main villain, the evil Samurai Warlord, has transformed into mindless soldiers to do his dark bidding.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=400188372\nTaking on role of Hiro, the youngest of all the mini ninjas and the last mini ninja to be sent out by the villages Ninja Master to discover the truth behind the storms that have suddenly appeared, desecrating the land. With all the Ninja Masters previous students failing to return with any kind of information - the fate of the world is soon bestowed upon the young shoulders of Hiro and his best friend Futo as they set out to discover what is causing the land such grave troubles. It is soon revealed that an evil Samurai Warlord, already once banished from the land, has returned to the world using the ancient art of Kuji magic to reign down ravaging storms and transform its innocent wildlife into mindless warriors. Kuji magic, it is soon discovered, is Hiro's ace in the hole. While the other missing mini ninjas may have mastered the techniques of ninja-hood it's Hiro's ability to master the arts of the Kuji that will be the lands saving grace.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=400268600\nMini Nijas features some incredibly tight controls and an engaging combat system (that includes various forms of Kuji magic learnt on the fly) as Hiro discovers lost Kuji magic scrolls in the most unlikeliest of places that will enable him and Futo to progress through the games ravaged lands. Along the way Hiro will also be tasked with locating the whereabouts of each missing mini ninja that the Ninja Master sent out initially and who never returned. Once each character is located and freed, they become available for use in game as the player is able to switch between Hiro, Futo and each freed mini ninja. Each mini ninja comes with his own distinct playstyle so one never really gets bored as you switch in and out of characters making use of each ones abilities.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=399493899\nAlong the way you will encounter Samurai Bosses sent out by the evil Samurai Warlord himself to thwart your progress. These bosses are not particularly challenging and mostly rely on quick-time events to defeat although in order to initiate these sequences you will first need to uncover each bosses weakness. These boss encounters are fun to engage with book-ending each of Mini Ninjas chapters perfectly. If I have a gripe with the game it's that the games camera occasionally takes on a life of its own as it twists and turns leaving you a bit disorientated in some of the battle sequences that play out. While certainly not game breaking in any way or form it does sometimes get mildly annoying.\n\nMini Ninjas is a simple game and while it may not provide much in the way of challenge to an older, more experienced crowd, still ends up being a joy to play because the way the game perfectly executes what it sets out to do. If you have any younger kids in your household that are always hankering to play something from your library then I would highly suggest picking up Mini Ninjas for them (and yourself of course). IO Interactive have succeeded in delivering a charming, albeit simple, little gem of a title that should see joy being spread around the room in equal measures for those playing the game or simply watching it.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this review please follow my curator group at:-\nCurator Rater","March 11, 2015","true","11.6"," 85 of 97 people (88%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","88","85","97","4","12"

You can see that from the very presentation, to the fact that you don’t actually kill anyone despite battling countless “ninjas” on the way. As such it doesn’t offer much of a challenge, but it’s not easier than, say, Assassin’s Creed. That said it’s a game which is incredibly fun to play. It cute, it’s funny and the combat system is tight and satisfying. It has several playable characters which are kind of like different classes from RPGs, a crafting system and encourages exploration with a clever implementation of search for “spell scrolls”.\n\nDefinitely an overlooked game, and it’s a damn shame I would’ve liked a sequel.

I love the characters, enemies and combat system, (usually) and the game's voice actors do a pretty good job as well. It has quite an "open world" feel, whereas, it's not an open world, but you don't feel limited to a single path. The story is simple, you're a ninja and the evil samurai warlord is threatening to take over the world. You go out on a quest to defeat this warlord and save the ninjas who failed to do so before you. The game looks very nice in my opinion, and the music, while not anything amazing, does compliment it nicely. Combat system works good, you get a couple ninjas you can switch between, To be honest I only used like 3-4 of them, and that's because sometimes you must use a specific character. The bosses are basically: Run from boss until you're able to do a quicktime event. They're all quicktime events, so don't expect a whole lot of difficulty with them.\nBut for me, I found this game to have some broken aspects/parts. On the "avalanche escape" sequence, It's incredibly hard to see, which is understandable, but I kept falling through cracks, or holes, and instead of dying, I'd be rolling/sliding until the avalanche eventually caught up with me. This was a VERY monotonous part of the game, and it really put a downer on the overall game. When you are in your hat on the water, it's quite soothing. but when you have to use your hat/boat to go through small waterways, it's incredibly slow and can be irritating.  This game is indeed a kids game, don't expect a big story, deep characters or a long playthrough, but I have to admit, the cutscenes between the Warlord and his captains are hilarious.\nThis is a very good game for 10 euros, and I got it in a sale for 4, so I really recommend this game for players looking to burn off a couple hours without much challenge. I give it a fair 7/10, it's a cute game and it's worth the money.","March 30, 2014","true","7.2"," 36 of 38 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","36","38","0","3"

But it also is home to a number of hidden gems that no one really talks about much.\n\nMini Ninjas is one of those gems. A bit of an imperfect one, sure, but a gem nontheless. And like many hidden gems, it doesn't get a whole lot of attention.\n\nThe game is kinda an action adventure game, with small elements of RPG and stealth. You play the role of a ninja named Hiro, who is tasked with finding all his lost friends and saving the world while he is at it. A lot of pressure, I know, but then you are a ninja with the power to control the elements, so it shouldn't be too hard (Which kinda is a problem for the game, I'll explain later)\n\nBeing that you play the role of a ninja, stealth is a tool you'll be making a lot of use out of. As some might indicate, however, the stealth aspect of the game isn't really all that advanced, and oftentimes isn't used to avoid fights so much as it is to get the first strike in any given fight (or outright kill everyone in a patrol before they even have time to react). While it is possible to avoid fights, you won't want to in the early game, because you need to fight to gain XP and level up. Otherwise, the road ahead will be awfully harsh to those who don't kick enough butt. While quietly avoiding fights isn't encouraged (At least in the early game), the stealth system does indeed work very well, and in the late game, where  by then you are already maxed out, it becomes much more viable.\n\nWhen the time comes to fight, however, it is a mixed bag. Combat is simple, with a few basic attacks, a block breaker, and even a super move that can cause all sorts of pain for those unlucky to be the target of it. You also have a selection of items that can make fights go more smoothly, such as pepper bombs and potions that make arrows bounce off your face. However, the problem is that it IS simple, even to the point of simply mashing the two buttons until everyone is dead before moving on to the next fight. I myself don't mind it, but those seeking a deeper combat system might not enjoy the game as much.\n\nSure, as you progress through the game you'll unlock more ninjas to fight with, each having their own style (Such as the fat ninja's brute force hammer skills that can make fighting larger enemies blindingly easy, or the archer ninja's ranged combat skills). However, I never really did bother to use any of them besides the ninja you start with. In DK 64, the devs made it so that you had to use all the Kongs in order to beat the game, so you couldn't just march through the whole game with Donkey Kong the whole time. Not so much here, where you can get through the entire game without changing ninjas ONCE. Maybe on hard mode, you would have to swap out ninjas more often, but on normal mode it is rather pointless for the most part, and in some cases even more fun, since fighting larger enemies feels more satisfying when you have to put up a real fight to take them down, rather than swapping over to fat ninja and just wailing on them, stun locking them to death. And even moreso, the starter ninja is the only one who can use magic, and as you progress through the game, you'll learn how important magic is.\n\nSo, the combat is ok at best, the whole 6 ninja team gimmic is iffy when you can go through the whole game with the main star of the game just fine (and possibly makes the adventure so much more interesting and challenging), and stealth early on, while it does play a considerable role in the game, is mostly used for ambushing more than avoiding conflict altogether. And yet... I love this game.\n\nMaybe it is because it reminds me of the glory days, back when we had games like Banjo & Kazooie 1 & 2, Conker's Bad Fur Day, Jak and Daxter... You know those kind of games? The ones where you feel like you are on a real adventure throughout an interesting, if sometimes even strange, world waiting to be explored. You start out in your humble village, venturing out chapter after chapter on your way to the big bad guy himself, taking out his generals and anyone else who dares to get in your way, while at the same time taking a moment to explore the area for goodies and new spells to unlock. It helps that the world and the music that fills it is quite appealing, making the journey all the more enjoyable. That, and it is around 9-10 hours on my first playthrough, so you get your money's worth for sure. Gotta love a game that keeps you busy for a nice long while.\n\nAs much as I'd like to yammer on and on, I'd like to wrap it up as a game that, while the gem is a bit cloudy, it is a gem nontheless, and a shame that it isn't more popular, let alone given a respected sequel (instead getting spinoffs on the Kinect and a Ipad runner.. Yeah, kinda a sad fate for the ninjas if you ask me).","December 14, 2014","true","26.1"," 31 of 33 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","31","33","2","0"

The setting is simple: A samurai warlord created an army by turning adorable animals into little warriors with his evil magic. The protagonists' mission is to defeat him and restore the balance of nature. Each character has his/ her unique abilities and special moves. Plus there are a lot of Kuji spells, potions and weapons so you can develop your own tactics to fight off the enemies. Besides, there are various scenes which are stunning and refreshing. You can fish, look for herbs and new Kuji spells while exploring.\n\nThe boss fights are incredibly fun as they have different weaknesses and you have to find out the specific tricks yourself to defeat them. The soundtracks composed by Japanese traditional instruments work flawlessly and suit the gameplay very well. The rhythmic Taiko Drumming adds so much tension.\n\nHowever, the length of this game might be too short for those who have no interest in exploring and collecting stuff. The game might not work well in newer systems (because this is a rather old game)\n\nTo conclude, Mini Ninjas provided me an unforgettable gaming experience. I highly recommend this game to anyone who likes relaxing gameplay and imaginative stories.\n\n9/10","July 11, 2011","true","17.7"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","1"

It's  a very laid back hack and slash adventure that can be enjoyed by all ages. The combat is the weakest part as it is very simple compaired to most other games in the same genre. However the art style and Japanese setting is very nice to look at and actually it's simplicity makes it all the more enjoyable to play and explore. It tries to encoporate an open world design for each level while still being very linear, like the Crysis series there are different ways to approach and complete each goal. Overall I recommend this game to anyone who has younger kids to entertain, or has an interest in Japanese culture, or anyone that wants to switch off and kill a few hours. 7.5/10","September 1, 2014","true","6.1"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

Honestly, I wish I could recommend this game, and it does a lot in that direction. And yet, I can't. Let me explain:\n\nPros:  Cute graphics - even scary ghosts aren't that scary!\nNice music and SFX - I found it hilarious every time I heard the samurais' alert cries\nEasy combat - you don't need to be on edge constantlyCons:  Boss fight equals Quick Time Event - QTEs are a terrible feature that feast on the soul of certain players (you missed a click? Oooh, how sad: let's go through the whole sequence again!); on the other hand, fights are very forgiving in general, so I'll give it a pass\nCamera movement - gosh, developers, if your game hinges at some point on timed jumps or appraised distance, don't force sudden automated camera movement on the player!\nThe Avalanche level - I gave a pass to the QTE, I can't do so here. Out of the left field, the game throws at you an obstacle race timed level. Not optional. With finicky checkpoints (took me three times to pass a certain point for it to remember I had). Add an environment hard to navigate because white and blue on white and blue (see? Our ice and snow are so well done), with white noise growing the closer the avalanche is. And if you hit some obstacles, toss in a QTE. This type of gameplay hadn't been built up anywhere previously (sure, you had the rapids, but those were very easy). This level made for a frustrating experience, too punishing for what amounts to a game aimed at kids. This level managed to erase all the fun I was having. This level tipped the scales of my review. Thank you, game devs.","October 18, 2015","false","18.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

You can possess bears to attack the samurai, or swiftly fly by them as a rabbit.  Also, as far as I know, nobody actually dies. It is better than most games worth $60, and for $10, it's worth it.

You gather herbs/plants to craft potions! There are about 22 levels and a 15 level cap for the character. It's a easy game, even on hard but the final boss, if you are playing on hard and you don't own the time spell like me you can't kill him, and then I had to lower the difficulty on the last boss.

The story is good but it's so empty and simple, you only know of the story when you start and then when you finich the game with the narrator talking over images. Other thing, and I didnt mind about it, but still, could be like the last boss, is that the previous bosses are QTEs only.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/recommended/35000/","Maxmetpt","Maxmetpt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/","704 products in account","Mini Ninjas feels like a throwback to the PSX and N64 era, with games like Banjo Kazooei, Super Mario 64, Medievil and so on.\nIt's a 3D Action Platformer, designed to have open levels, with collectibles spread all over.\n\nWhile the game's description (on this page) is not entirely wrong, it can be deceiving. First off, if you're looking for a Stealth game, do not get this one. While stealth is possible, it's neither encouraged by the level design, nor very useful.\nThe enemies are not designed to be approach silently, nor do the rooms have several possible entries and exits. It's not that type of game.\n\nIt's more of a game designed for children, with a very lighthearted story, levels and Boss fights. Which isn't necessarly a bad thing.\n\nLet's talk about presentation first.\nDespite being a game from 2009, it's looks great!\nThe cartoony style fits well with the game's vibe, and everything looks very clean and smooth. No complaints here whatsoever, except for the background's resolution. For some reason, their resolution is noticeable lower, and feels weird to look at. But it's a minor complaint!\nIt achieves the japanese looks very well, and uses simplicity to its advantage.\n\n\nThe music is also really good, and complements the theme perfectly. It's not something that will be stuck in your head or anything, though. It's "merely" textural music, that adds a lot to the atmosphere and feels quite relaxing.\nDuring the more action-driven sections, the Taiko drums will also come in for a decent adrenaline rush. Overall, pretty good!\nOne issue, though. Sometimes, the sound would start glitching for no apparent reason, making the game sound like System Shock instead of a ninja/samurai-themed game. I don't know what caused it, but just take that in mind.\n\n\n\nSo far, so good! Why am I not recommending this game, then? Well, the level design and game mechanics don't fit very well together, unfortunately, which leads to an experience that gets repetitive very quickly.\n\nFirst off, the combat is very button mash-y. You have a normal hit, and a heavier hit, to stun blocking opponents. You can also run and jump. There are very few possible combos with these attacks, as can be imagined, which makes every fight be very much the same.\nYou'll also unlock spells and other ninjas throughout your journey, as well as potions.\n\nThe different ninjas are a great idea, but their execution is very flawed. Each ninja has a different special ability, and weapon. These can differ in range, speed, damage, etc. There's a ninja with a big hammer, one with claws, one with a spear, a bow, etc. And this could have been used very effectively! But it's not. Why? Mainly, because the appropriate situations and placed right when you get said character. And you can use them there pretty well. But throughout the rest of the game, their usefulness is very limited, and you're better off just using the normal ninja.\nSpells are useful, and more fun to use on large groups of opponents, but very rarely are necessary. Only the basic ninja is able to use them as well, which further limits the other ones. (You can switch between them at will, but it's still not worth the hassle).\n\nThe potions are also a big flaw in the game, in my opinion. With the exception of Health potions, you have absolutely no reason to use them! They're not useful, nor necessary at any point in the game. To that, add that you'll have to use them from the menu, which means pausing the game and looking for the right one. It simply breaks the pacing, without a benefit. You can use keybindings for some potions, but those will most likely be in use for the spells already.\nIt could have been a great addition, but there are no situations that ask for the use of these potions, so it's just a game mechanic and is left unused throughout. A waste of space, sorry to say.\n\nYou can either get these by finding them in the levels, buying them from vendors, or crafting them with plants that you'll gather.\n\n\n\nSo, now that the main mechanics are out of the way, let's talk about level design.\nThere are 22 levels, 5 of which are Boss Fights. In each of them, there are 5 things to look out for: Spells, Plants, Coins, Statues, and Caged Animals.\nAside from reaching the end of each level, you may want to collect these items.\n\nThis leads to levels being very open, with these items spread throughout. Unfortunately, unlike, say, Super Mario 64, none of the levels was very interesting. In Mario, every level had a lot of different content, with different areas, character, challenging platforming sections, racing, etc. etc. Every single level was crafted carefuly.\nIn Mini Ninjas, the levels are mostly bland. The items seem "hidden" randomly, transforming exploration into tedious walking. Besides, there doesn't really seem to be any reward by collecting these. While you can use the plants for crafting, and coins to buy potions/tools, these are never really useful, so, once again, it's wasted space.\n\nThe same goes with the caged animals, which you can free for kindness alone, without any reward.\n\nWhile some levels to have different sections, the game drags for too long, starting about halfway through it. There are river rapids and an avalanche sections, in which you'll have to dodge rocks and trees at a high speed, but aside from those, all the levels play very similarly. (They do look differently, though, so that's good. There are mountains, snow, rice plantations, etc. etc. decent variety)\n\nEnemy variety is also questionable. Some enemies require somewhat different approaches, but not something enough to provide challenge. I've played it on Hard Mode, and you can certainly steamroll through the whole thing without much of a problem. This, once again, leads to a not very interesting game.\n\n\nFinally, let's talk about the Boss fights.\nThe last fight was great! You had to use the different spells at your disposal to beat him, which took a couple of tries to get the strategy. The other ones, unfortunately, were just a question of baiting them, followed by a QTE section.\n\nYou would observe their behaviour, until you got what to do to "unlock" the QTE. And then just to the same thing 3 times and you're done.\nIt's a shame. Boss fights can usually be really interesting and different, but this game didn't seem to seize that opportunity very well.\n\n\nI've written enough.\nWhile I feel that Mini Ninja's heart is on the right place, its execution leaves a lot to be desired. It could have been a very fun game if it had used all its mechanics appropriately, or simply making a more condensed experience.\nSince it doesn't, I can't recommend this game at all.\nWait for A Hat in Time, perhaps, if you're itching for this kind of gameplay!","August 19, 2014","false","10.0"," 13 of 39 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","13","39","0","0"

After restarting my PC the sound worked in game. Ok, not a big deal i guess i can live with having to do some work.\n\n2. Stutter. I noticed every ~5 seconds the game would drop about 10 FPS. (i always have fraps running when gaming.) Not sure why i again take to the forums. Turns out its a common issue with HID devices, you either have to unplug your mouse and keyboard and use a xbox360 controller (i have one so no big deal, but i have a Dell T5500 and my USB ports are hard to get to so this isn't an option), or you have to monkey with your HID devices in Device manager, killing each one to find the one that is cause the stutter.  (this must be done each time you want to play).\n\nI'm not willing to let this get to strike three, so i'm going to mark this game as FAIL! un-install and forget i even have it. i doubt i could get a refund since i bought durring a sale long ago.\n\nsuch a shame, looked like it would have been fun.","March 8, 2015","false","0.1"," 5 of 22 people (23%) found this review helpful","23","5","22","0","0"

I feel a little dissapointed, as it's more of an exploritory beat-em-up than a ninja game. You are not really rewarded for stealth, in fact you are somwhat punished - you only gain XP / level up by killing enemies, and there are no real stealth kills possible.\n\nI also feel that the UI is somewhat clunky / made for consoles,  the camera doesn't always do what I want it to, and I can only select from 6 items at a time, when I may have 20 available to me, and I need to got through 2 sets of menus and then press another key to activate an ability.\n\nI do like how it slow-motions as you are selecting an ability, that's pretty cool.\n\nThe other thing, is that the game story and progression feels very slow. I have not found any plot developments, and I'm 5h into this game. I'm just getting bored with it. There's nothing 'wrong' with it, it just doesn't feel like much fun.\n\nI also dislike how one of the coolestr things you can do (posess animals) is most useful with bigger animals, which are usually caged and heavily protected, you have to wipe out the enemies to get to the animals so that you can use them to... wipe out the enemies you just wiped out.\n\nSo, basically, I got bored with this cutesy little ninja game about running in guns blazing.","January 1, 2015","false","5.2"," 7 of 27 people (26%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","26","7","27","0","0"

It's definitely not a "thumbs up", I was sure about that. But is it worth a "thumbs down"? Too bad there is no neutral vote.\n\nIn the end, I went for "thumbs down". I haven't finished the game yet, but I'm close to the end (in the 'living castle'), and I may or may not finish it.\n\nThe game doesn't start off bad; the style is fun, and I really like how my little guy reacts when he enters a boss arena.\n\nI even liked the bosses. This is rare, as bosses in most games tend to be just overpowered, frustrating garbage -- but the mini ninja bosses all work the same, and it's mostly a series of quicktimes that you just have to trigger in different ways and not fail 3 times. I can deal with that. Plus, you get that evil yoda cutscene at the end of the fight.\n\nHowever, things really went downhill when they introduced the last enemy type -- samurai that basically drain my health items since they are hard to kill and deal damage that usually can't be avoided because by the time you see that attack starting you're already in an attack of your own trying to take that guy down. Sometimes you even get two of these.\n\nSow areas where annoying as hell -- with most of the drops being white, and the ground being solid white, things are impossible to spot. But that's\nmerely an annoyance. One of many, on top of those special samurai that don't show up all that often. Checkpoints are "one use", and once they introduced those samurai I didn't dare venture into unknown territory before activating a checkpoint.\n\nI also started to spend a lot of time moving animals out of range of those resurrection guys that I might be encountering. Especially animals that produce any kind of special samurai.\n\nAs the game dragged along, doing the same things over and over and over again, always at risk to meet one of those almost unkillable samurai, I was finally getting into what seems to be the last level. Or close to it.\n\nExcept that I get those uber samurai in dual packs now. Or in a situation where I'm not allowed to do anything, but they can rip me apart no problem. Unless I drop to the floor where hordes of other enemies are waiting for me, in addition to those special samurai who will be following me.\n\nBesides, I'm running out of health items... those guys need tons of them, and there are no fruits to be found in the castle so I can only use the few items that I have with me.\n\nI also have too many characters ("friends") to choose from, without really knowing what they do. I've only ever used 2 of these -- one seems to be required to kill a certain type of enemy (or so the game told me), the other one has a ranged attack.\n\nSo, in the end, it kept turning into a pain to move along, and I might not even make it to the end. I cannot possibly give that a thumbs up.\n","March 21, 2015","false","19.8"," 2 of 16 people (13%) found this review helpful","13","2","16","0","1"

Sure, there are stealth mechanics, sure, some areas give you paths to sneak past enemies, but if you want to rescue animals and gain XP, the only way you'll do that is by charging in and killing everything you see. You in fact lose out if you stealth.\n\nThis game is about as barebones as it gets. Despite being a linier game split into levels, the end of each level tell you how many collectables you managed to snag on your way there. This includes: freed animals, flowers, Jinzo statues, spell scrolls, and money. "Great", you might think, "Lots of replayability!" Well, you'd be wrong. Freeing animals gives you XP, collecting plants gives you ingredients with which to craft potions (which I have yet to need), scrolls give you new spells, and the statues? Well, they're purely collectables - all of which, as far as I can tell, have absolutely no reward for collecting them all. There are no achevements, either on Steam or in-game, and aside from your base stats which are improved automatically when you level-up, there isn't anything they could offer in the way of a reward anyway. And yes, you read that correctly: money is a commodity. It's that useless.\n\nMini Ninjas is an empty, soulless (albeit cute) journey down a long woodland-themed corridoor, with no real incentive to stray off the beaten path besides completionism. Fighting is just mashing 'attack', with special attacks or spells that one-hit-kill. The only reason you'd need to switch characters is to kill the heavy enemy (which is only easily killed by your heavy ninja) or cast spells, which only the default character can. The English voice-acting also seems to be have been assigned exclusively to one guy.\n\nSo what's good? Well, the art-style is lovely. The mixture of ambient Japanese dialogue and English cutscene dialogue is nice. You can control animals, which is oddly rare in games... And that's about it.\n\nCONCLUSION: It pains me to say this about anything in the Ninja genre, but I recommend giving this title a miss, unless you're buying it for a child - the cartoon violence, quirky designs and easy controls make this a good entry-level romp through ancient Japanese culture.","December 2, 2014","false","10.5"," 3 of 19 people (16%) found this review helpful","16","3","19","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RunningShovel/recommended/35000/","RunningShovel","Shovel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RunningShovel/","231 products in account","Have you seen those screenshots? This game is PRETTY. Designed to a tee and brimming with charm and character, every area is a visual treat and full of areas to explore as well as a beaten track. There's some collectables and hidden areas everywhere, and with the help of the local (and adorable) fauna, you can sniff out the neat sights. Enemy design is also helped by wonderful, wonderful voice acting, and excellent characterisation of what ultimately are faceless goons and mooks. The enemy commanders are so at odds with what you might expect from a distance, and it's a lot of fun every time you get to engage one alone.\n\nThe mechanics are a little odd when you think about it. On the face of it, the combat is pretty shallow. You've got an attack, a guard-breaker/stun, a block, and a dodge roll. It's simple, hit things, if they start blocking, stun, if they start hitting, block or dodge. There's not a lot of nuance and it's very forgiving, especially for the main combat system. But then again, the actual grit of the system is a finely-tuned machine. Strikes work on actual physical contact rather than wide hitboxes, so it's entirely possible to say, dodge a spear thrust just by moving to the side, or knock arrows out of the air with good timing. You'd be surprised what you can do with the simple tools offered, which are healthily supplanted by a vast array of ninja tools, bombs and potions, as well as character-specific special moves.\n\nOnce you start unlocking other ninjas, you'll find things start getting very interesting indeed. They all have their unique niche, be it crowd clearing, ranged attacking, going fast, heavy damage, whatever. You'll find yourself flipping between them with impunity, often using all of them within one conflict. They do overlap though, so often it comes down to favourites, but that's okay too because they're all great. The specials all have their own uses, but again, you'll find yourself playing favourites depending on your usual style.\n\nIt's not a kid's game, but it is a kid-friendly game. It's not like, stupidly easy, but it's not punishingly hard either. As an example, your health doesn't regenerate, but in any given area there'll be several ways to heal, if you look around. You can catch fish, brew/find/loot/buy potions, search for food on trees and in bushes, and a number of items have healing side-effects. There's a lot of stuff to do in here, and it could be overwhelming, but everything in the game is approached with such... just, here's a bunch of stuff, go. There's no point at which you're forced to brew potions, nor is there a forced catching fish segment. Those things are just there if you want to do them, and that's great.\n\nI think one of the key ideas here is options. You've got a handful of characters, a couple dozen spells and items, a place to get to and enemies between you and it. After that, it's all up to you. Wanna sneak around the grass and pick off the sentries? Fine! What about assaulting with explosives and keeping your distance? Sure! Simply run in and start smashing things, chugging health potions as needed? Go for it! There's a million different ways to play every encounter, and all of them are fun. The ease on the eyes doesn't hurt it either, and it's always nice to come across the next area and gasp a little at how pretty it is.\n\n+\nA wonderful, pretty journey\nCharming as hell\nOptions galore\nPlenty of length\n\n-\nAvalanche (Protip: Sprint)\n\n\nWould you like to spend a nice time on a beautiful adventure filled with cute characters and forgiving but fun combat?

Along with that assumption came the idea that the gameplay mechanics would be simplistic, the levels would be basic and really guided, and that the game would be small, easy, and not worth bothering with.\n\nAlong comes the Steam Winter Sale, and I figure that for a few dollars, I might as well check it out.\n\nThis game completely blew me away!\n\nThe first layer of gameplay complexity comes when you start rescuing your friends. You're enabled to switch between different characters with vastly different movement speed, attacks, and weaponry at the click of a button, even in the middle of combat. This opens up a whole new world of strategy as you can change your whole attack set in an instant.\n\nTo further the depth, the game features a rudimentary crafting system. By finding various plants, you're able to craft potions which help you in your quest. They range from the basic health potion to the very useful Flame Oil (which makes your sword on fire).\n\nOn top of the various potions, there are also purchaseable/scavengeable Ninja tools. These range from Shuriken and caltrops to various types of bombs. You even have a fishing rod you can use to fish for food/health.\n\nFinally, you have various Kuji Magic spells you can employ. These are very powerful and will come in handy constantly.\n\nYou also have a hat, which acts as a basic shield to block incoming arrows. You also use it as a boat on water, and a sled on snow.\n\nThere are a good amount of levels to explore, and exploration is encouraged as you need to explore to find all the Kuji magic spells and plants you need to craft your potions.\n\nThe music and sound design is stellar. The world is very alive feeling, and is populated with believable sounds which form a detailed soundscape.\n\nGraphics are also wonderful, mixing careful detail with a very abstract painterly/paper style of art.\n\nThe only issue I had was instability. That is easily fixed by finding and installing the OpenAL 2.1.0.0 runtimes. All of the earlier ones caused constant crashing on my computer.\n\nTLDR: Great game, way more depth than one would assume.","January 31, 2014","true","16.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you can look past radial menues, annoying "hints" that pop up in your HUD during gameplay, and an "antistropic filtering"-option that only seems to invert colours in the game, you've got a marvellous platformer with gameplay-mechanics that actually feel solid and smooth with keyboard and mouse.\nThe graphics are very clean and stylized in an almost Nintendo-esque fashion.\nThis game reminds me of all my years with Super Mario on the N64 and Spyro on the PS.\n\nVery much recommended.","May 24, 2012","true","11.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

It doesn't let story get in the way of simple ninja-versus-army-of-samurai action. However, its greatest flaw is the lack of any real challenge. All enemies and bosses are weak and predictable, and your team of YAANGU NIINJYA start out with everything they need to kick butt, then proceed to get crazy overpowered. By the end of the game your main ninja pal learns some ninjutsu that kills everything in the area.\n\nIf you play it, go into it expecting a charming experience, not a legitimate challenge.

Mini Ninjas is Zelda-like in look and feel, and can be approached via various playstyles (rushing/attacking, stealth or collecting/playing slowly for example). It's brief, but engaging and fun throughout.","May 20","true","5.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
