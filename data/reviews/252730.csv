As a long-time owner (yeah, I got it when it originally came out in 1995 on CD-ROM...), I can truly say the charm remains, as does the irreverence.  Despite the years, the sarcasm and prodding by the “host” is just as relevant now as it was then.  I always leave the game with a smile on my face.\n\nNot only does the Steam re-release introduce a whole new generation to YDKJ, but it ditches the CD-ROM and related issues (Try grabbing the original disc and installing it on a modern, 64-bit O/S.  Won’t happen without a LOT of work)...\n\nMy only real gripe is that the game is perpetually stuck at a 640x480 resolution, and going full-screen requires a manual change of the PC’s resolution to 720x480\n\n**P.S.  DO NOT forget to snag the others in the franchise.  They're worth every penny!","December 2, 2013","true","0.8"," 22 of 23 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","22","23","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/undox/recommended/252730/","undox","undox","http://steamcommunity.com/id/undox/","4205 products in account","To make this clear, this is not for the 2011 game.  Instead, it covers the original 1995 game.  For those that are not familiar with the series, how the game works is that the host will read a question and give four possible answers.  If you think that you know the answer, buzz in and answer.  While this sounds like your typical trivia game, this is far from the truth.\n\nOne thing unique to the game is that the players receive screws.  If a question appears that it looks like another player does not know, you can use the screw to “screw your opponent” forcing them to answer.  If somebody has the lead, using them is a good way to try to catch up.  However, if they know the answer, not only will they gain money, but also you will screw yourself and lose money instead.  They may be screws, but that risk make them double-edged sword instead.\n\nAnother difference from a traditional trivia game is that the host wants action.  If one player has a big lead but nobody tries to answer the question, the host will not be happy.  When that happens, the host will comment on the leader’s cowardice and gets the audience involved.  How can there be an audience in a video game is a mystery.  When they get involved, they will say, “Don’t be a wimp!” forcing the leader to answer anyway.  If you are trailing and know this, intentionally not answering is both advantageous as well as funny watching the leader’s reaction.\n\nVisually, this is the game’s biggest weakness.  Most of the time, the only things to see are some faded text, the current question, and the player scores.  The only real animation worth watching is seeing what happens to your icon when the score changes.  While this sounds strange, a blind person can play this game with a person that can see without any problems.  With almost nothing to see, not even the host, there is little reason to watch the screen.  Since this is a trivia game, making a stage like in Jeopardy! or Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? would have made the game more interesting to look at.\n\nHowever, this is not a game about the visuals.  Being that this was one of the first CD games, they crammed it with tons of dialog.  That dialog is what makes the game fun.  The host always has something interesting to say throughout the question.  Even with the categories for the questions, it gets you interested in what it might be.  In one case, in the category is “The Fruits in Your Looms”, they ask, “Which of these fruits derives from the Aztec word meaning testicle?”  Just the fact that they would create questions using such seemingly unrelated items makes each of the questions interesting to hear.  In the case of the mentioned question, the correct answer is avocado.  When it comments about it and guacamole can make people burst out in laughter.  When the comments are strong enough, do not be surprised if a break is required to recover from the laughter.\n\nConsidering that the game has hundreds of questions like the one above, this makes a great party game.  Just remember that the game really works only when played with others.  Since the game offers no computer opponents, it is not the same without live competition.  While the humor is there, without competition, the game does not have the same appeal.\n\nThere is one final thing to remember.  When the game wants you to type in your answer, tell the game, “F%¢& Y@#”.  All three players should do this.  You will love how the host reacts.  What the host does to you, not so much.","August 27, 2014","true","15.3"," 25 of 31 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","25","31","0","0"

That shouldn't be taken as an insult to the series, but a compliment to just how timeless and clever the original still is.\n\nIf you've never played YDKJ, the gist is that it's a game show in your living room (or wherever your computer might resides. A raunchy, hilarious, shamelessly offensive, and remarkably clever trivia game that never misses a chance to break the forth wall to insult you, as it simultaneously pretends to congratulate your correct answer. The developers clearly loved what they were doing and that shows through in an abundance of little touches that add so much, from the fake commercials to the terrible names they bestow upon you, to the unrivaled abuse of pop culture in every question and the effortless delivery by your host Cookie. If you aren't laughing, you may very well be dead inside.\n\nThe only "con" I can give YDKJ is that given its age, some of the questions and references are a bit dated. Those without ample knowledge of the 80's and 90's might find themselves a bit lost at times, so if you are hoping for something a bit more relevant one of the more recent games may be a better choice. Everyone else shouldn't hesitate to pick this up, grab two friends (and some drinks while you're at it), and get ready to burst into tears as you learn:\n\nYou Don't Know Jack!","December 3, 2013","true","3.0"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

A time when life was slow (dial-up), and we were just playing games on our computers and systems as usual. This is a trivia game, a funny one. Although many of the jokes are dated due to the game's age, it is still very amusing and fun. You can play with up to three friends (including yourself) in local multiplayer, and due to the game's age there is no online multiplayer. However, you can do what I do and just download Teamviewer which is a free software, have your friend(s) install it, then have them connect to your PC. You will get quite a few laughs out of this one, with some silly questions. It's actually worth getting the questions wrong just because of the host's response. Playing by yourself isn't as fun as playing with friends, though.\nFinal Score In Words: If you have friends, get this game and play with them.","October 27, 2014","true","1.2"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

In its day, it was one of the greatest games of all time, purely for the sound and music.  The action "behind the scenes" in terms of audio made this game visceral.  Streaming it over a 56K dialup connection was laboriously slow but worth the wait.  Later gaming consoles brought about titles like "Buzz" for the Sony Play Station.  But this was the grand daddy of them all.  From the host who made you feel like crap if you got an answer wrong, to the ability to "Screw" your apponents, this was one of the best party games available in the 90's.\nThe best experiences were when you played with friends, though it does have a single player option.  The mini games like "Jack Attack" and "The Gibberish Question" kept the gameplay moving along in a way that you couldnt wait to see what the next category was.\nGreat Game :)","December 2, 2013","true","0.7"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

There were a few PC games I played in the wee years of my life, when dial-up was the only way to connect to the World Wide Web. The original You Don't Know Jack was one of them. To be fair, I had a censored version, for some odd reason. I don't think the game was purchased for me, I just remember finding it. Still, it was the funniest thing I could think of -- this game came out in 1997 and I must have found it a few years after that because my earliest memories playing with a computer started a few years after that. I was barely in elementary school, yet I played this trivia game whenever I could. I guess you could say it started a life-long pattern of being able to recall weird, strange, and seemingly random facts. It's like when babies listen to mozart, except I was impressing myself with all sorts of weird knowledge.\n\nAnd You Don't Know Jack is really interesting in that regard. This game is more like Jeopardy! than it is other, less meaningful trivia. Except Jellyvision and everyone behind it knew how to combine those silly pop cultural references that the vast majority of people seem to harp on and actually injected some interesting knowledge into it. Questions of the classics, but asked in a hypothetical question with the Flinstones or some other television character inserted into it in order to have it make more sense or to properly frame it. The tagline, spoken in game, does it the most justice: When pop culture and high culture collide. It's a good trivia game, as in it actually tickles your brain and asks questions of a difficult yet interesting and worldly manner. But it also comes with a high octane humor and witty introspection that has me coming back to the game, even now, even before it was available this way on Steam. I showed this game to some friends a few months ago, except I had found my original disk and loaded it up on a Windows 98 virtual machine. I went to those lengths just to play those same trivia questions again. I might have gone through them all, except I played the censored version.... what more wonders do I have in store?\n\nSo, I might be biased. This was a game I grew up with, and here it is - apparently restored and bundled with every other You Don't Know Jack Game (except for the 2013 edition) for $5.

The only disappointment with this title, really, is that everyone has to huddle around a keyboard.  Basically newer games with their multiplayer support and this game's randomization every play would be aces.","December 29, 2014","true","0.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
