It is a point-and-click style, casual adventure game that takes you on a wondrous ride through a microcosmic fantasy world inhabited by bugs and critters.  Any fan of point-and-click, adventure-puzzle games will likely enjoy the experience.\n\nThe best feature of this game is the overall charm inherent in its delivery.  The art style and the soundscape together create the alluring atmosphere of the game.  The simple story is told through animations and emotion-filled sounds rather than through text and dialogue.  Despite the simple storytelling mechanics, all the characters you play and those you meet are uniquely interesting and charming.\n\nThe actual gameplay requires you to progress the story by solving puzzles via interaction with the world around you.  It will be mostly trial and error; but nothing is too daunting.  I felt the puzzles were a good balance of tricky and sensible; but they are not all necessarily logical.  You will have to think about the puzzles in terms of the wacky game-world dynamics.\n\nThe game is rather short, even shorter if you rush through the main objectives.  It is more enjoyable (and still somewhat short) if you take the time to interact with everything and see what you can discover.  There are plenty of hidden “Easter eggs” and collectibles scattered throughout the game to cater to those who enjoy treasure hunts and achievements.\n\nBotanicula is definitely a well-designed game that was created with love and care.  I recommend that any point-and-click, adventure-puzzle gamer considering trying it.  Its charm will cater to fans of the genre both young and old.\n\nFollow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!","June 23, 2015","true","5.6"," 41 of 43 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","41","43","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/saere/recommended/207690/","saere","Saere","http://steamcommunity.com/id/saere/","465 products in account","I've thought about writing a review for Botanicula for a few weeks now. Aside from the fact that there are numerous apt (and more briefly stated) praises already posted here, the game has been out for a few years now.\n\nIt's an Indie, point-and-click, puzzle adventure; brought to us by the Czech creators of Samorost 1&2 and Machinarium, Amanita Design – if you enjoy either of those games, you will take delight in this. The thoroughly organic world and its inhabitants are highly imaginative, some even bizarre-looking and -sounding. Some players may consider it too succinct, or even more attuned toward children. The simple story, though solid and sweet, does not require heavy ruminations – this is a game of the senses, pure and simple. You control a group of four friends on a mission to plant a seed. The main goal on each level progresses you to the next level; the puzzles are intuitive. The price of the game, whether regular or on sale, is appropriate. Yes, it is a Flash game. (Interesting to note that I cannot enjoy tBoI or Windosill on my current PC setup without gameplay becoming bogged down almost instantly; but with Botanicula, never any bogging or catching.) Summed up: the graphics, gameplay, sound and music - all superb, A+++. What more can I say to get you to try out this lovely gem?...\n\nThere was a tremendous amount of heart put into this game, truly.\n\nBotanicula is a visual and (emphasis on) auditory indulgence: you may think you're just going to ease into it, test the waters with your big toe; but you will be swept away and never realise it till the ride comes to its satisfyingly, cyclical conclusion. It offers a kind of cleansing and respite, whether from the mundane of the outside world, or to just step away from frenetic and adrenaline-packed L4D2 runs.\n\nThe sounds are sheer ear candy – you want to touch everything. The world is strange and wondrous: during first-time gameplay, you never know what manner of creature or environment alteration will manifest itself from your curiosity-driven touching; subsequent gameplays (for myself, anyway) do not fail to continually instill such positive feelings because the graphics, music, creatures and environment (plus their corresponding sounds) are just that sublime.\n\nWhile there are, sadly, no cards to obtain from playing this game toward earning badges, the 47 in-game, animated cards more than make up for it; and count toward the game's 53 achievements. It is rewarding to collect them all (and yes, you will aspire to collect each and every one of them in every gameplay you attempt, even the time-spent Svolavac. (Though, I think there should be a card for the 3 jingle-y leaves that tumble out around your feet - other gamers like myself may know what I'm alluding to.) The names of the creatures achievements are in Czech, and punching them up into Google translate will not only add to your enjoyment, but enlighten it, as well.\n\nThe music steals you off from the word go, setting a pace perfectly harmonised to what is happening in the game, at that time. A previous reviewer here made mention of the burst of cheery song that erupts when you achieve a goal – it really does fill you with sheer happiness, no kidding... and lately, when playing L4D2, I've been thinking how cool (if a bit bizarre) it would be, hearing that tune after everyone's made it alive to the saferoom...\n\nDefinitely give it a try, if only to experience the eye and ear candy... if it doesn't turn out to be your kind of game - or you can only enjoy one gameplay - you will know someone who'll love it...\n\n11/10","October 5, 2014","true","10.5"," 27 of 28 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","27","28","0","0"

Unique hand-drawn artwork and a wonderful music score and overall sound design. A game children, parents and grandparents might enjoy, alone or together.\n\nI will note that the puzzles sometimes seem arbitrary rather than logical - sometimes getting ahead in the story involves just clicking on everything until something happens, but that didn't detract too much from my enjoyment of the game. Indeed it often lead to discovering whimsical little moments in the game that might otherwise have been missed.","January 9, 2015","true","17.6"," 20 of 21 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","20","21","0","3"

Two extremely long chapters hold back its final score though, as they just drag on for way too long.\n\nLong version:Before Samorost 3, Botanicula was probably the longest Amanita Design game with its 4-6 hours of play time (as opposed to the 30-120 minutes we are used from them). It is also unique in their portfolio in the sense that it has a cohesive central plot line about a group of sentient plants and their journey along the branches of a life-giving, glowing tree. Their task is no smaller than saving the last seed of their tree from an evil light-eating spider-like monster and its numerous offspring.\nStill, at its core, it is a surrealist adventure, this time showcased in the many small sub-stories that form each chapter. If you are looking for all those unexplainable moments, like a random onion using a fishing rod to get a mount to ride on, you’ll find those in abundance.\n\nWhile it was commendable that they tried to make a full-fledged adventure game, its size also presents a drawback. This is most notorious in the underground section, which is so full of running around that it gets actually boring. But I also could mention the city, where the usual voiceless and textless approach adds an unnecessary difficulty modifier to the often unexplained puzzles. Sometimes progress can be more of a question of luck than problem solving skills.\n\nWith all these put together, Botanicula is a strange beast, because I cannot recommend it for those who are not familiar with this studio’s games. But if you already have some experience with Amanita Design, then Botanicula may be among your favourite adventure games.","May 16","true","5.3"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","0"

It's not very long, but sometimes that can be a positive - the game doesn't outstay its welcome and the pacing is perfect.\n\nYou can see in the screenshots that this game has a striking visual style, and personally I think it is beautiful. The creature designs are so wonderful and unique, and despite having a pretty serious phobia of insects I managed to complete the game without freaking out.\n\nThe sound design is the best I've ever heard in a game, the music is intertwined with the game mechanics and in some puzzles the background music joins in with what's going on. It's hard to describe, but if you have any itnerest in interactive audio design then it's well worth checking this out.\n\nThis is another game by Amanita Design that incorporates non-verbal story telling and they're really good at it. There isn't a single word spoken or written throughout the game, and yet you're able to follow the story through the visuals.\n\nThe puzzles were actually quite easy by adventure game standards and I don't think I had to look anything up.

The art style is unique, the soundtrack is incredible, and the five playable characters have so much personality without actually saying a word.\n- I love how interactive this game is. Random bugs, plants, etc. can be clicked on and most give you achievements.\n- The storyline is well developed, as are the minor characters. This game is filled with little whimsical moments involving the littlest things – a spider hiding behind a leaf, eggs hatching.\n- Pretty sure I sat at my desk with this amazed expression on my face the whole time (the soundtrack gets to you, man!).\n\nCons:\n- While I played through this twice (once for story, once for achievements – I’m not posting a review of anything until I 100% it), there is very little in the replay value aspect. Keep in mind if you play this that you should really pay attention and experience the story the first playthrough, because it won’t be the same the next time.\n- The puzzles are very easy, which would make this a great game for younger children, but might become a bit boring for those who like a challenge.","April 5, 2015","true","5.8"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","8","8","0","0"

Machinarium was a much more somber view of a machine's wasteland, it also used more traditional means of gameply (solve everything to continue, whether through traditiona puzzles or point and click cleverness). Botanicula is a much more vibrant world and takes a different approach to its gameplay. Though there are plenty of puzzles that can be solved without too much headscratching, there are also little secrets and optional creatures to encounter.\n\nBotanicula is both a beautiful and strange world. Though some objects and settings are recognizable (such as a tree, seed, insects) everything is so alive and full of wonder. Accompanying the superb artwork of the game, are the sounds of Czech band DVA. The music in this game is full of suitably strange and wild tones. Chimes, bells, vocal gymnastics, strings, and just about anything else finds its way into the soundtrack. The music and sound design are perfect for this game.\n\nAmantia Design has put together a menagerie of sights and sounds that is completely unforgettable.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ravenousbear/recommended/207690/","ravenousbear","DaHi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ravenousbear/","705 products in account","The thing that immediately stood out to me about Botanicula was how charming it is. This is due in large part to the excellent audio, both from the folktronica soundtrack and the sound effects, which incorporate a wide variety of unintelligible vocal sounds that make the game feel really lighthearted and playful. Another contributor to the charm is the animations, which are very exaggerated, like a cartoon. They are key to communicating the story and objectives since the game doesn't use text or spoken word at all. Also, the game looks pretty great; I was impressed by the large variety of creatively-designed creatures you encounter throughout the game.\n\nOn the gameplay front, it's pretty much what you would expect from a point-and-click adventure game. You are primarily clicking (or clicking and dragging) on objects in the environment in order to solve puzzles and advance through the game. In general, the puzzles are reasonably difficult; while a fair number of them were not all that challenging, a few had me stumped for quite a while. For one puzzle, I came up with a solution that I didn't think the game would acknowledge, but lo and behold, it totally worked, which was a great feeling.\n\nA lot of adventure games become tedious when you have to cycle through your large inventory of items, trying to use them somewhere in the environment. Botanicula takes great care in reducing the need for this because you only ever have a small number of items at any one time, there are no item combinations, and for any given scene it's easy to check if an item can be used or not. I really appreciated this about Botanicula.\n\nMy gripes with the game are pretty minor. When I first started playing, differentiating between interactable objects that were just for show and ones that would help me solve a puzzle was a bit difficult. Also, the first area, where you are walking on tree branches, was too visually similar from scene to scene, which made navigating the area a bit difficult. The future areas, fortunately, greatly improve upon this.\n\nIn short, Bontanicula is a pretty great game. It never stops exuding its charm and does away with what has frustrated me about adventure games in the past.\n","December 14, 2013","true","3.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The music and sound effects, in my opinion, are the absolute highlight, made with experimentalism - for exemple, coral voices a little "angelic" and ridiculous at the same time that give the game an air of fantasy, exploration, innocence and silly comedy. The feeling is you are listening to a track of a movie or an experimental musician - for example, the March of the Penguins (with incredible track made by Emilie Simon), or some albuns of Björk, or even a cheerful folk with life, child and funny at the same time.\n\npros:\n- Beautiful graphics;\n- Almost everything have interaction in the forest;\n- Has some easter eggs;\n- Humorous;\n- The music and sound effects.\n\nCons:\n- The game is delightfully short. You want to play more, devours the game, but it ends up fast before my desire to see more. HONESTLY I hope there is an expansion that give me triple playable hours. I want more, more of these characters, more from this universe that was created.\n\nIn short: I recommend this game!\n***************************************************************************************************************************\nJogo incrível! Os desafios são interessantes, a jogabilidade é extremamente fácil, os personagens são muito carismáticos, a história é divertida e envolvente! As músicas e efeitos sonoros, na minha opinião, são o destaque absoluto! Tudo com experimentalismos, coral de vozes ao mesmo tempo angelicais e ridículas que dão ao jogo um ar de fantasia, exploração, inocência e humor bobo. A sensação é que você está ouvindo trilha de algum filme ou um musicista experimental - me lembrei, por exemplo, do Marcha dos Pinguins, com a trilha da incrível Emilie Simon, de alguns trabalhos da Björk, de um folk meio alegre com a vida, infantil e ao mesmo tempo engraçado.\n\nPrós:\n- Gráficos muito bonitos;\n- Praticamente tudo possui interação na floresta;\n- Possui alguns easter eggs;\n- Bem humorado;\n- As músicas e efeitos sonoros.\n\nContras:\n- O jogo é deliciosamente curto. Você quer jogar mais, devora o jogo, mas ele acaba rápido perante a minha vontade de ver mais. Espero HONESTAMENTE que haja uma expansão, que me dê o triplo de horas jogáveis. Quero mais, muito mais destes personagens, deste universo que foi criado.\n\nResumindo: Recomendo, como aquele amor delicioso que se vive nas férias, mas que termina rapidamente no fim do verão.","December 1, 2014","true","3.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The trailers they released for it didn’t really show much in terms of gameplay or plot, it focused more on the kooky little characters. Which are adorable by the way!\nAny who, I got this game in a bundle shortly after it came out and I jumped into it not know what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised with this game, it’s a point and click set in a wonderful and artistically done tree. And you are a small gang of various things that inhabit that tree, who have banded together to save it from evil dark life-sucking spider-like creatures!\nAs per usual in Amanita Design’s games the Art style is amazing; it has a very distinct look about it and really is something beautiful to look at.\nThe characters are lovable, and for someone who normally hates the “gibberish” voices in games, I actually thought their little noises and shouts were both fitting to the game and easy on the ears. (The crying noise that the conkers make on several occasions is just one of the best things I have ever heard, it’s so amusing to me)\nIt’s a strange game, but it is so unique. I enjoyed this game a lot, I played through it once and shortly after discovered it had steam achievements, so played through it again! I liked it that much!\nI will always look forward to new Amanita Designs games.\n\nGreat game!\nIf you like something a little unique and you like point and click games, this is something I think you will enjoy a lot.","June 6, 2012","true","5.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ravenousbear/recommended/207690/","ravenousbear","DaHi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ravenousbear/","705 products in account","The thing that immediately stood out to me about Botanicula was how charming it is. This is due in large part to the excellent audio, both from the folktronica soundtrack and the sound effects, which incorporate a wide variety of unintelligible vocal sounds that make the game feel really lighthearted and playful. Another contributor to the charm is the animations, which are very exaggerated, like a cartoon. They are key to communicating the story and objectives since the game doesn't use text or spoken word at all. Also, the game looks pretty great; I was impressed by the large variety of creatively-designed creatures you encounter throughout the game.\n\nOn the gameplay front, it's pretty much what you would expect from a point-and-click adventure game. You are primarily clicking (or clicking and dragging) on objects in the environment in order to solve puzzles and advance through the game. In general, the puzzles are reasonably difficult; while a fair number of them were not all that challenging, a few had me stumped for quite a while. For one puzzle, I came up with a solution that I didn't think the game would acknowledge, but lo and behold, it totally worked, which was a great feeling.\n\nA lot of adventure games become tedious when you have to cycle through your large inventory of items, trying to use them somewhere in the environment. Botanicula takes great care in reducing the need for this because you only ever have a small number of items at any one time, there are no item combinations, and for any given scene it's easy to check if an item can be used or not. I really appreciated this about Botanicula.\n\nMy gripes with the game are pretty minor. When I first started playing, differentiating between interactable objects that were just for show and ones that would help me solve a puzzle was a bit difficult. Also, the first area, where you are walking on tree branches, was too visually similar from scene to scene, which made navigating the area a bit difficult. The future areas, fortunately, greatly improve upon this.\n\nIn short, Bontanicula is a pretty great game. It never stops exuding its charm and does away with what has frustrated me about adventure games in the past.\n","December 14, 2013","true","3.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

This is similar to Machinarium which is developed by the same team. However, the setting is completely different. You follow a team of magical insects as they try to save their tree.\n\nOptionally, along the way you meet a host of magical insects whose mysteries you are encouraged to unravel and are rewarded with a card for your "Bestiary" collection. The cards are secondary though and merely there to represent that you have explored all the mysteries with that particular insect, and you can move on.\n\nThe mysteries themselves are hypothesis-oriented. You attempt various different experiments on that screen until eventually, you figure out how the magical insect operates. Unlike Machinarium, Botanicula has barely any item-collection oriented puzzles (and those it has are really obvious - as in an insect asking for a specific item), so most of the puzzles can be solved on the screen you are on. This lowers the scope of brute forcing and makes the actual puzzle solving a lot more enjoyable. When you need some extra knowledge or oomph from another screen, it completely becomes obvious that you've run out of actions and there's enough to explore that you can leave and then come back later with some novel insight.\n\nHowever, while I have not referenced a walkthrough once and find this game charming and satisfying, I have noticed other reviewers saying that the puzzles are frustrating and very difficult. So keep that in mind and perhaps this is one of those games that you should DEMO before committing to, to see whether it's frustrating or fun for you.\n\nAll in all, a pleasurable and enjoyable experience from a team that I will be following in their future endeavours.","February 23","true","3.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It is not a long game, and could easily be finished in a few hours. However it is aesthetically stunning with fun secrets to be uncovered in addition to the main story-line puzzle and a well-matched auditory track.\n\nHonestly, my favourite thing about this game is how much it challanged me as a puzzler and encouraged descovering the secrets through the use of "cards" in game (and Steam achievements out). After finishing the game I even had to play back through to uncover all of the achievements and cards.","April 1","true","5.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

This game has quite an array of puzzles to solve, all while presenting you with beautifully simplistic sounds, visuals, and humor. I'm not sure it's something I'd find myself coming back to over and over again, but I missed quite a few cards on my first run through so it might be worth it to come back at least once to see what I missed!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sightblind/recommended/207690/","sightblind","SightBlind","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sightblind/","29 products in account","This game is without question weird. And that’s definitely to its favor.\nBotanicula is a point-and-click adventure game about the faunal flora residents of a fantastical tree trying to stop a dark, arachnid-like entity from destroying everything they know. If it sounds strange already, then trust me when I say you don’t know the half of it.\nTo begin, gameplay is standard to the genre; as the player, your job is to explore the grand extent of the tree from the dramatically miniscule perspective of your band of five oddball characters. In your adventuring, you are provided the opportunity to interact with nearly every aspect of your environment, collecting items, receiving and completing small quests and challenges, solving puzzles, and unraveling the simple and yet still fascinating narrative before you, often making use of the individual assets of your tiny arboreal team to do so, and all without the game ever uttering more than a few words of human speech in the process.\nUsing that as a steppingstone, I transition into aesthetics. The artwork is absolutely beautiful, reminiscent of the animated fair of Tim Burton. Yet, even as there is a bizarre and almost twisted nature to the visuals, the presentation remains almost perpetually lighthearted (most of the time). Nearly every aspect of the tree that the small band of main characters inhabits has a life of its own and each is immensely unique from one to the next (so much so, there’s even a card-collecting mechanic within the game that showcases a solid plethora of these many faces whenever the player takes interest in looking back). Meanwhile, the main team itself is an odd collective of friends who, while not given heavy character development, are filled with heart and personality. Matching up with the strange visuals and dreamlike presentation is an almost unearthly soundtrack from Czech musical group DVA, who also aided in other aspects of the final product.\nAs I stated earlier, there is almost no true verbal dialogue outside of the intentionally indecipherable mumbles of its characters, and next to no text of any kind; the entirety of the story is recalled and played out on screen as if on a stage. Nevertheless, it is an engaging narrative, even as it is a simple one. In the end, the game isn’t especially lengthy, nor is it predominantly difficult (I, considering myself a less impressive gamer, was able to complete it in right around 5 hours); additionally, like most games in its subset genre, it tends to be a casual experience without an exceptional abundance of high-velocity or high-intensity moments during play. Do any of these facts diminish the value of this game? My answer is an emphatic no. When approaching almost any artistic product—be it a game, a song, a movie, or anything else—it’s important to remember that rarely, if ever, will a piece of art appeal to everyone; even the most popular or widely received products will have people who simply don’t enjoy it the way others do, and this one is certainly not exempt by any means.\nBotanicula is definitely a strange piece of work. It’s a wild adventure that takes place almost entirely in a tree; it’s a bizarre introduction to a lovable cast and a beautiful world; it’s a story without many words, yet it is filled with all sorts of heart and humor (sometimes irreverent—discerning gamers/parents, feel free to message me for more details); it’s a relatively calm, somewhat brief, light-hearted game that had me entranced, entertained, and engaged all the way through.\nTo sum it up shortly: it was pretty weird, and it was pretty awesome.","January 24","true","6.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

I warmly recommend it to everyone. Botanicula is a journey in a different world. No dialogs but you manage to understand the feelings of the characters. You can spend hours looking for some small details hidden on the different levels. The graphics and the music give the game a very zen atmosphere. It is relaxing even though some riddles are twisted. Have fun and play the game. When you finish it, you will have the feeling you have done something good :).\nSo far I got 113 of the 123 cards.","January 27, 2013","true","9.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

If you are the type that appreciates presentation and art over gameplay,  Botanicula is your type of game.  The story is something about some tree dying somewhere and evil spiders have taken over or something, but story isn't too important here.  You control a group of five characters that travel together trying to save the world and during your adventure you'll run into puzzles and tasks that require completion to progress through the game.  However this is the game's best moments, in clicking environmental objects and backgrounds to see what animations will play and how the characters respond.  Your interactions are mostly with fictional bug creatures and plantlife, which really helps to develop what kind of world Botanicula is set it.  It is charming and fun at first, but halfway through the game I had to look up a walkthrough multiple times to see what to do.  It becomes a case of not what your logical thinking is, but what the devolopers had in mind when designing it, and that can stop your progress to a halt.  The puzzles, while usually frustrating, were never so hard to the point of ragequitting.  Throughout the game you will collect cards that can be viewed at any time for amusing animations and sounds based on the creatures and environments you play through.  Supposedly there is a secret ending or reward for collecting all of them, but I didn't stress myself to the point of that and don't feel motivated to play again.  Overall I do recommned Botanicula to fans of point-and-click games and to the more casual crowd of gamers.  However I don't think Botanicula is worth the full price of $10 as it isn't very long and it does have frustrating moments.  Pick it up when it's on sale or in a bundle.","June 27, 2014","true","5.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I'll admit that I started playing this as it looked like an easy 100% (which it is), but I was amazed at how quickly it drew me in.  Sure it's cutesy and the hardcore gamer (whatever that means anymore) may scoff at it, but do yourself a favor and set aside 3-4 hours for this.  It's funny, it's charming, it will brighten your day - it's kind of like playing a Pixar movie.  It's not a traditional point and click, but if you've played Machinarium or the Samorost series you know what to expect (basically click on everything enough times - but there are a few decent puzzles).  The only sticking point may be the price tag: $10 seems like it might be a bit much for 3-4 hours (I believe I got this in a humble bundle at some point).

If you're looking to knock out a few hours with a laid back game about cute insect-like creatures trying to save their world from darkness, then this is the game for you!  A gang of five join forces to rid their world of dark forces, which are sucking the light and life right out of their tree(s).  This game is about puzzles and even allows you to duke it out with some of the shadowy forces in the final chapter.  If you hate puzzle games, turn back now.  The last few chapters are only that.\nThe music is a bit repetitive, but I hardly noticed as it was light and playful.  The sound effects went well with the gameplay and gave the creatures unique personalities.  The graphics were well-thought out and made the gameplay fun.  It was especially interesting to watch as the mood became darker and shadow forces began overpowering the light left in the trees.\nWhile the achievements are relatively easy to get, I would advise use of this guide (http://jayisgames.com/archives/2012/04/botanicula.php) if you are planning on getting every single one.  It can be a bit grating, because once you leave a level you cannot come back (and to get the Mythology achievement, you must have collected every card from every level).

It doesn't have much in the way of gameplay but it manages to have just enough to engage the player, separating it from gimmicky games like Mountain.\n\nThe art style is strange but fun, the music is relaxing and pleasant, and the story is woven around you without a single ounce of spoken dialogue. Probably because it's an indie game and they couldn't afford voice actors, but I prefer it this way to begin with!\n\nOn the downside the ending feels very rushed and in several areas of the game mechanics are introduced once, used once to retrieve a necessary object, and then forgotten about. The ending gameplay areas feel very rushed and a little sloppy. It has all the benefits of an artsy game, but it comes with the downsides of being a budget game.\n\nAs a gamer I'm satisfied with the $10 bill I paid to play this game and would recommend it at that price or lower. You can watch my let's play of the game below to see if the game is right for you, though I do warn you that if you get lost in the music too much you'll forever be trapped.\n\nhttp://youtu.be/fBf7vNtwSzc","December 23, 2014","true","8.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Botanicula is a simple, funny and lighthearted tale about many, many creatures, whose peaceful lives among the tree's branches are endangered by sinister Zlo, and their only hope is a mismatched, brave team of main heroes, on quest to plant the seed of a new tree...\n\nPuzzles mostly follow the trend of increasing difficulty toward the end of the game, but aren't challenging to the point of frustration. Gameplay is very pleasant - interactions between various characters are humorous, and enthusiasm of our little heroes is quite catching.\n\nBackground music perfectly suits the mood set by the story. Graphics give me somewhat nostalgic feeling, reminding of some old cartoons and causing to find them mostly cute :)\n\nIf you're not averse to simple point'n'click games, you should play Botanicula, it's really lovely :)","December 10, 2013","true","6.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

A lot of your attention might be drawn to the wacky characters, but I think what I really liked about this game is the pace.  It plays out kind of like a good kids movie.  When you succeed in a puzzle, your cast of four plant buddies give out a 'yoohoo!' and charge onward with an upbeat riff of music.  There are funny scenes that will definately make you laugh, some impressive sights and vistas that give a sense of awe, and dark scary environments for the 'villains' of the game.  Again, it feels like a well done kid's movie.  I'm not usually a fan of wacky / weird themes like this, especially since I didnt like it in other games like Psychonauts, but I feel like it worked really well here.  The pacing and sound design, which uses a lot of human vocal noise and mixed sound, really helps a lot I think.\n\nThe game runs well, has a good set of options, and a very clean save / load / inventory system.  Since it is a point of note for P+C games, it should be mentioned that it is not possible to game over either.  A good game, but comes in a little short since its no more than 3 or 4 hours long.  I'd still reccommend it.","March 27, 2014","true","3.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I can't say I remember how long it took to complete everything in Botanicula, but every minute was worth it. Rarely have I seen a game that captured whimsy in such a poignant way. With no dialogue other than sounds and grunts, the game manages to portray a story of despair & hope, longing & belonging and wonder at the vastness of everything.\n\nThe visuals are just sumptious. The soundtrack is perfectly suited and individualized, like a theme song for each character or unique moment. I don't think you could ask for a more compelling take on a puzzle quest type game, that never has to beat you over the head that it's a puzzle quest.\n\nI don't think I could more highly praise the work of the designers and production team.

It has distinctive animation and a clever plot all conveyed with no words and a gentle,  pleasing soundtrack which just envelopes you into the world of the game.\n\nThe puzzles within the game are unusual and make you think outside of the box.  In fact, the whole game makes you think outside of the normal challenges you find in most adventure games. They are clever and all very "let's try this and see what happens"  (e.g. if you touch this, what happens and how will that reaction help you).  The game sparked an intuitive exploration mode in me that I didn't know I had and I enjoyed every moment of wandering in its world and not just racing through it to find an ending.\n\nA bonus for me is that this is not a violent game other than trying to do away with a bad spider.  This may sound like a lame plot to most hardcore game players who are used to destroying enemies, dominating warloads, and relying on magic and combat to find a just end for the hero.  It isn't.  The fact that the game can be totally interesting and thoughtful without those trappings makes the game magical.\n\nI hope the developers create more games like this.  Kudos!  I highly recommend the game to all ages (although the very young might want assistance every now and then but how fun would that be to actually interact with your child to solve the game).","April 29","true","6.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The plot is quite simple, but all the little details thrown in throughout the world will entice you to explore more. This is a game for all ages, literally.

". That pretty much sums it up and is everything you need to know.\n\nOn your journey you come across a huge (really huge) variety of other creatues. With nearly all of them you can interact in some way, sometimes just for the fun of it but mostly to actually solve any of the numerous puzzles in the game. Nearly anything in the game you interact with produces some sort of animation, often causing cool animations or hilarious slapstick shows, so there's definitely no lack of humour in Botanicula.\n\nThe visual art style and design of the creatures and the world is incredibly unique and definitely stands out from the masses. It seems bizarre at first, but the longer you play the game, the more you notice that this is the absolutely perfect choice for an art style. Anything else would've probably limited Amanita Design in their creativity and simply make Botanicula yet another point and click puzzle game.\n\nSound and music also plays a big role in the game. Often you come across a group of creatures which, if interacted properly with, start singing or playing music on their crazy instruments. The music perfectly fits the overall style of the game and provides you with a feel-good feeling. Additionally, most of the sound effects like jumping, falling, bumping and so on are self-recorded by actual people (imagine yourself being a kid and playing with action figures or space ships: pew pew, wooosh, boing, zappp - stuff like that). Once again, artificial sound effects would probably just not work out in this game.\n\nWith roughly 3 hours, the game isn't exceptionally long, but once you get into it, you will enjoy every single second of the game. Apart from the fact that the Steam Overlay doesn't seem to work with the game, there's really nothing bad I could say about this Botanicula.\n\nIt's unique, detailed, funny, mildly challenging and overall one of the best Indie games I've played in a while.

I'm pretty sure they did more shrooms this time around because this is by far their strangest game.  You play a group of little plant-inspired characters whose goal is to rid their home tree of and entity that is corrupting it.\n\nAs a point-and-click adventure game, the gameplay mostly consists of solving short (occasionally long) puzzles which will grant you items needed to continue or reveal various hideous and deformed creatures.  There is no voice acting so the story is told purely through imagery, which actually works quite well.\n\nThe game has fantastic artwork and good music.

But I can appreciate the effort that was put into it, and I must say that the final product couldn't be much better than it is, I'd say. But it's not my kind of game.\n\nIf your familiar with Amanita's games, you'll know this already, but the highly stylized world and characters is their main focus. Like its predecessors, it's a point n' click game, and it has the same problems I have with nearly every game in the genre: you simply click everything on the screen until something happens. And that's not fun for me. It doesn't matter how pretty the world is, that alone simply isn't enough to captivate me.\nOn the other hand, if you enjoy these kinds of games, you'll most likely be amazed with this! The amount of detail put into the "bugs/creatures" and the environments is mesmerizing, and I have to give them credit for that. Amanita Design strikes again!\n\nIt's a shame that they always do point n' click games. I'm always impressed with their world design and charming way of memorably presenting simple stories... But the gameplay really lacks, with the amount of downtime there is between traversing from a screen to another.\nAlso, level design was a bit too labyrinthic in levels 2 and 3, having huge areas for the player to go back and forth to get different objects to progress. That's something that wouldn't be as bad if there was something to the gameplay other than clicking an edge of the screen and waiting for the little guys to walk there.\n\n\nAside from the traditional gameplay, there are some animated scenes, which are really great, one even representing how the "Amanita Universe" was created, with the Big Bang and both Samorost and Machinarium worlds forming. I feel like I would have enjoyed "seeing" a let's play of this game, rather than playing. They've scored everything in this, except for the gameplay.\nThe soundtrack fits the game's aesthetic very well, so I simply can't have any complaints about its presentation, it's amazing.\n\nSo, if you like point n' click games, go ahead, you'll have a blast!

M.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pilgrimage/","524 products in account","The sorta kinda well-not-really sequel to the popular Machinarium. Except this time it isn't about scrap and robots but nature and what lives on a tree.\n\nYou play as Mr. Lantern and his 4 friends who are trying to save their home, a giant tree, from a parasitic spider-like creature that sucks out the life of said tree and its inhabitants. To do that, they need to bring a seed of the tree down to the ground, a journey that takes them to many interesting locations, situations and characters that are just plain charming and fun to watch. Such as when you encounter a genie and every character has to make a wish, one of them creating a Ferris wheel while the soundtrack by the Hungarian band DVA acoustically stimulates your endorphin production.\n\nThe puzzles are much simpler than in Machinarium which actually view as an improvement. I remember getting frustrated with some of the puzzles in that game and even more with the tip function that required you to get past a little shoot-em-up every time you wanted to take a look. On top of that it also had a tendency to just freeze up which is a natural occurrence when you make a game in Flash that is more ambitious and complex than the usual array of games made with it.\n\nLuckily Botanicula doesn't suffer from any of those problems. There are just a few items here and there, other than that the puzzles can be usually solved on the same screen, just like Amanita Design's first two games, Samorost 1 and 2.\n\nThe many achievements might lead you to think that Botanicula is rather long, but that isn't the case. The 6 chapters can be played through in about half an hour each. The achievements are related to a little card collecting feature: each new character or creature you meet will give you its card and unlock the corresponding achievement. The majority are mandatory to meet in order to finish the game, but some are optional and require you to find them.\n\nI played the game with such a huge grin on my face. I haven't been charmed by a game like this in a very long time. Easily one of my favorite games of 2012.","January 19, 2013","true","3.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The music and sound effects adding to what Amanita Design is great at doing, a worldless atmosphere. The ambience that plays throughout has never felt repetitive and there are many times where you can add to it.\n\nWhere other adventure games risk losing it's charm over frustrating moments like "clicking like mad to figure out how to solve this puzzel". The world is so lively that it's fun trying everything. The little animations, the bells and songs that make the language of these little creatures and their world.\n\nSound and music is a big part to this atmophere.

The puzzles are fairly simple (which is fine in my book). And the game is much shorter than I expected. But if you enjoy adventure games like me, it's definitely worth checking out. I did feel somewhat underwhelmed due to the greatness that was Machinarium. But Machinarium is one of the best adventure games ever made, so the comparison isn't very fair.","February 26, 2013","true","4.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

But I can appreciate the effort that was put into it, and I must say that the final product couldn't be much better than it is, I'd say. But it's not my kind of game.\n\nIf your familiar with Amanita's games, you'll know this already, but the highly stylized world and characters is their main focus. Like its predecessors, it's a point n' click game, and it has the same problems I have with nearly every game in the genre: you simply click everything on the screen until something happens. And that's not fun for me. It doesn't matter how pretty the world is, that alone simply isn't enough to captivate me.\nOn the other hand, if you enjoy these kinds of games, you'll most likely be amazed with this! The amount of detail put into the "bugs/creatures" and the environments is mesmerizing, and I have to give them credit for that. Amanita Design strikes again!\n\nIt's a shame that they always do point n' click games. I'm always impressed with their world design and charming way of memorably presenting simple stories... But the gameplay really lacks, with the amount of downtime there is between traversing from a screen to another.\nAlso, level design was a bit too labyrinthic in levels 2 and 3, having huge areas for the player to go back and forth to get different objects to progress. That's something that wouldn't be as bad if there was something to the gameplay other than clicking an edge of the screen and waiting for the little guys to walk there.\n\n\nAside from the traditional gameplay, there are some animated scenes, which are really great, one even representing how the "Amanita Universe" was created, with the Big Bang and both Samorost and Machinarium worlds forming. I feel like I would have enjoyed "seeing" a let's play of this game, rather than playing. They've scored everything in this, except for the gameplay.\nThe soundtrack fits the game's aesthetic very well, so I simply can't have any complaints about its presentation, it's amazing.\n\nSo, if you like point n' click games, go ahead, you'll have a blast! Otherwise, don't expect this to change your mind.","December 23, 2013","true","4.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

There are also some traditional inventory puzzles, and a few simple mini-games along the way. The story is told through images, and if any of the creatures talk, it's in nonsensical gibberish. There is no text, except for in the menus.  Just get it. It's delightful. It's not long, but it's not expensive, either.","December 21, 2012","true","7.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

The word "puzzles" is generous; Most gameplay involves clicking on every creature in the game until they spit out a key. The main characters give off a cutesy feel, but their constant squeaks and giggling language eventually grates. Esthetically unique but unable to decide if it wants to be silly or creepy. The result is creepy... and unsettling.\n\nACHIEVEMENTS: If you do attempt this game because it's already in your Steam library from a Humble Bundle you bought 3 years ago, the achievements are easy but at the same time frustrating because is game is so slow paced. The achievements are largely clicking on every creature in the whole game.

Not that I have played lots of these kind of games, but I think it's hard to beat this one in weirdness!\n\nThis is a very beautiful game, with light colors and peaceful surroundings. It got some funny-looking creatures aswell, some are actually really cute. Even the bad guys are cute! The soundtrack is also very relaxing and it all makes me rather happy. It got small funny details all over the place, and you can find even more if you start looking.\n\nBotanicula have a very easy and simple storyline, but it's the center of everything. There are no shorter stories or side-tracks at all! Short told, it's all about saving your neighbors and plant a seed safe down on the ground.\n\nThe gameplay itself is not that good, it's actually very confusing and complicated. You will lose all sense of direction rather quickly, and some of the tasks are extremly complicated to get correct. It's more about trying to click everything random with a tiny hope to get it right, rather than solving them as you would do with real problems and tasks. It's actually very fustrating, and even boring.\nSo the challenge is to keep yourself calm through the game, something I for once had problems doing.\n\nTo rate this game, and to recommend it or not, is very hard to decide.\nI think Botanicum is a game for those experienced with point & click games, with challenging tasks beyond avarage logic.\nBut I personally will not recommend this game for everyone, giving it a; 2/5","June 24, 2014","false","4.0"," 0 of 23 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","23","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pukemaster/recommended/207690/","pukemaster","Dad","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pukemaster/","144 products in account","I haven't smoked weed in, like, twelve years. The last time I chiefed that keef I was at a party at some DJ's house and he was handing out joints to everyone because I guess that's how DJ's win friends and influence people. I hesitated, but being that everyone else was doing it and I had no real reason not to, I smoked the one he gave to me.\n\nWeed is really stong these days. I don't know if they still grow the dirt weed that I used to smoke in high school, but back in the day I could do bong rips until the sun went down and not really be any worse off, just really hungry and couch-locked. That joint the dude gave me - that one joint - had me laid out on the couch thinking that my heart was going to explode and wishing I had never gone to that party in the first place. After we all smoked our joints the DJ announced that it was time for a cigarette break and motioned us all to step outside because for some reason weed was ok to smoke  indoors, but tobacco was not. So I stood up to follow everyone outside and as soon as I got up, my vision went black and I passed out on the floor. Just, like, crumpled and fell down. No one cared. Absolutely no one gave a ♥♥♥♥. Nobody ran to my side to see if I was okay, no one rolled me over to make sure I wouldn't vomit into my airway. Nothing. I came to a couple minutes later when everyone had finished smoking and these girls were just walking over me to get back inside and claim a spot in the comfortable chairs.\n\nA real friend - no, any decent human being - would have the compassion to check on the guy who just fell down and went unresponsive. And as unpleasant as that evening was, at least it taught me not to hang out with Ken and his DJ friend anymore.\n\nSO, this game may look cool, and have pretty colors and seem slighly reminiscent of Samorost, but the similarity ends there. It's not really that fun, and I would be remiss if I let you click that buy button. The puzzles are okay, I guess, but the more I played this pile, the more I found myself wishing I was playing Samorost.","February 17, 2015","false","0.2"," 2 of 30 people (7%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","7","2","30","8","0"

The creatures and environments are beautiful, the soundtrack and voices are so nice, that even when the story line is slightly creepy (a bunch of spider-like creatures are threatening the inhabitants of the Botanicula tree and a couple of seeds must do the saving) even the darkest episodes are full of charm and good vibes.\n\nThe game is a point and click with not much difficulty. Most of the puzzles can be solved with a little logic or even by simply trying what you can click on. To unlock all secrets and Steam achievements, some more skill-luck-persistence will be required (I am actually stuck with the Svolavac one; I know what I´m supposed to do but I havent found the right combo yet).\n\nI enjoyed the game so much that I re-started it just to see if I could get all the achievements. I´ve gone through it 3 times now and have only used hints for Svolavac, but I have taken longer on the 2 later runs because I am taking my time enjoying the scenery and soundtrack, the humorous interactions and the frog concert.\n\nI would recommend this game to anyone who likes original design, to anyone who appreciates audio-visual artwork, to anyone who likes plants and insects, point and click games or to anone who is simply looking for a unique and stress-less game.","January 4, 2015","true","7.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The creatures and environments are beautiful, the soundtrack and voices are so nice, that even when the story line is slightly creepy (a bunch of spider-like creatures are threatening the inhabitants of the Botanicula tree and a couple of seeds must do the saving) even the darkest episodes are full of charm and good vibes.\n\nThe game is a point and click with not much difficulty. Most of the puzzles can be solved with a little logic or even by simply trying what you can click on. To unlock all secrets and Steam achievements, some more skill-luck-persistence will be required (I am actually stuck with the Svolavac one; I know what I´m supposed to do but I havent found the right combo yet).\n\nI enjoyed the game so much that I re-started it just to see if I could get all the achievements. I´ve gone through it 3 times now and have only used hints for Svolavac, but I have taken longer on the 2 later runs because I am taking my time enjoying the scenery and soundtrack, the humorous interactions and the frog concert.\n\nI would recommend this game to anyone who likes original design, to anyone who appreciates audio-visual artwork, to anyone who likes plants and insects, point and click games or to anone who is simply looking for a unique and stress-less game.","January 4, 2015","true","7.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is a very cute point-and-click adventure with no possibility of death.  You play as five little plant-like characters exploring a large tree.  I had a three-year-old boy playtest this, and he loved counting the things he found and the pretty pictures.  I have to admit that a few (very few) of the puzzles have stumped me, so he couldn't play it all by himself, and he is fairly smart for a three-year-old.  He made very clear to me that he did not care much for the villainous spiders in the game, but I think that was the point.  For children ages 5-10, I think this is a real treat.  Adults may find it to be too simple.  10/10 for kids.  7/10 for adults.","March 1, 2015","true","16.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You want more? Okay. On the surface of it, Botanicula resembles a highly polished version of those online "click all around the screen and interesting things happen" Flash games. And I suppose that's exactly what it is. Unlike Machinarium, Amanita's previous big success, the focus here is less on solving minigames and more on encouraging interaction and exploration. With that in mind, this game is probably more suitable for younger players (although it does get quite dark towards the end) or casual gamers.\n\nThoroughly charming, with a beautiful setting, fantastic incidental music, memorable characters (who again, tell the entire story without a single line of dialogue) and wonderfully inventive set pieces make this a game well worth your time and effort.\n\nBe warned though, it does run on Adobe AIR so if you have problems with that particular application you may want to try the demo first.","November 18, 2014","true","4.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'm not a fan of this particular art style (kinda creepy but with a cutesy theme and background). However, I sat down and played it anyways. It turned out to be a rather fun little experience. Maybe only a few hours worth, but still good! It's an adventure point n click game, that follows a small band of tree residents (think plants and mushrooms that have been anthromophized) who rescue the last seed of the tree that they live in- their world- and try to take it down to the ground before a dark, life consuming force completely destroys the tree, its residents, and anything else it can. I found it to be a rather touching and entertaining story! and it didn't take too long either. Though I got this game as part of a bundle, I can honestly say I am glad to have played it. I reccomend it! :)","December 18, 2013","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I say that with pretty full confidence in my gaming memory. Don’t get me wrong, strange does not by any stretch mean bad. In fact, Botanicula is one of the best games, if not the best, that I have played all year. I love nearly everything about it, down to the absolute simplicity of the story. It’s a tale that’s been done many times before, but never quite like this.\n\nA fantastic tree is the home for many wonderful creatures. Magical life seeds grow from every limb… seeds that allow beings on the tree to live in peace and harmony. One day, a dark entity, one greatly resembling a dark spider, comes and begins to ingest all of the seeds, drawing away all of the life and happiness that the tree houses. It is up to a small group of nuts, seeds, and feathers (yes, you heard me right) to save their home from this evil that has fallen upon them.\n\nIt’s an odd take on a classic story. Botanicula takes a step in a direction most games won’t take. They’ve assigned the main roles of their tale to a bunch on inanimate, absolutely regular objects that live in a world of what I can only describe as magic. When was the last time you saw a game that had a feather diving in and out of holes to solve puzzles? It’s a daring move… or just weird, depending on how you view it. It’s a pleasure to play something that’s different, even from most indie games.\n\nBotanicula is a point-and-click adventure game. This is a genre in which I am not very well versed. I’m ashamed to admit that I haven’t played some of the classics, like King’s Quest. Botanicula is more streamlined than traditional point-and-clicks, but that isn’t a bad thing. There was only one or two points in which I truly couldn’t figure out what to do, but sitting there for an hour stuck on one puzzle never got overly frustrating. I never felt like the game was calling me out for being an idiot. If I couldn’t figure out a puzzle and I needed to sit there and solve it without moving, the game wouldn’t do any unnecessary movements or sounds reminding me that I need to move on. I appreciated that more than I thought I would.\n\nBotanicula’s puzzles are a mixture of movement-based solving games, exploration, and fetch quests. Yeah, I know, a game having good fetch quests? Well, but that’s what the genre of point-and-clicks are partially about. I mean, a lot of what they’re about are trying to solve what piece of which goes where. And, if you go back even farther, they are also “how the hell do I pick up this god-forsaken crowbar?” Botanicula doesn’t do that. It doesn’t hold your hand or give you hints, but it gives you as much time as you need to solve a puzzle. You can’t die, you can only be knocked part of the way back. It’s a nice touch.\n\nExploration is one of the best things about Botanicula. Some areas are completely pointless to the actual puzzle or storyline, but they’re added just so you can experience the beauty that this game truly has to offer. As you look around the tree, you’ll find different creatures and beings that you can interact with. Some of these creatures will give you cards or a pretty display of some kind. Adding the collectable cards into the game gives meandering a purpose, beyond just being a wonderful and rather relaxing pleasure.\n\nI usually save the art design and music for last when I’m in a review, but I simply can’t avoid talking about it any longer. Everything about this game is flooring. Everything. From the silly little sound effects down to the horror that the environment gives you in the later levels. With the exception of Bastion and Badland, I’ve yet to see a game with this quality of art this year.\n\nThe music is just indescribable. Really, it’s quite difficult to do. Everything about it gives off a mystic sense, but none of it seems to fit in any one genre. It all sounds like it comes from the same source, which is excellently implemented, as the tree is the centerpiece for the entire game. The music will make you feel what you need to. If you need to feel accomplished in this scene, you will. If you need to feel terrified, you will. If you need to have a feeling of foreboding, believe me, you will. It’s one of the best soundtracks in any game I’ve ever played. Ever.\n\nThe game doesn’t have any real talking in it, and I’m 100% okay with that. Dialogue would add absolutely nothing to the game. The story will make you feel for the characters without the use of speech. Sure, there is some humming, or quiet gibberish, or squeals and gasps, but they’re varied and far between. They only happen when they need to. There is no fat in this game. All of it is cut out. You only get what you need; what you deserve.\n\nThe sound effects are just as appropriate as the music, clearly. The group you play as has their own sounds that they make, generally as a group. The other characters in the game all make different noises as well, and each one seems to fit the situation perfectly. Some of the sound effects are annoying, but that’s not a bad thing. Except for when you’re stuck on a puzzle in which you have to hear an annoying sound over and over and over.\n\nVisual art is arguably the best part of the game. It’s beautiful. It’s also quite psychedelic. Those two seem to go hand in hand when it comes to good games. Every area on the tree is fitting to the characters in it, and everything feels… right. It’s hard to explain, really. I suppose it’s one of those things that you just need to experience for yourself.\n\nThe group with which you play all have different abilities that you can use at certain points, but it’s very rare you do so. This is one of my few complaints with this game. You’re playing as a group of five, but you only use each character’s special properties once or twice. At the end of the game (spoilers) you have to rescue four of the five characters from the dark spider. I would care a lot more about saving them if I felt like each of them had their own personality, and I didn’t really feel that.\n\nSpeaking of the giant spiders, they are the perfect antagonist for a game like this. They’re scary, but not scary in the same sense that we humans would find terrifying. Instead they make the characters (and, by proxy, you) feel nervous and uneasy about what they are and why they’re doing what they are. They are silent as well. It’s never explained why the spiders are trying to engulf the tree with darkness, but I think that’s one of the beauties of this game.\n\nIn case I haven’t made it clear already, Botanicula doesn’t make much sense. It doesn’t have a pulling backstory like Bastion or a continuous reactionary setting like Badland, but it makes a perfect balance with these games. Badland makes a perfect quick and easy yet puzzling reaction game. Bastion makes you cry and seriously feel for the characters within it, as you help them fight their way back home. Botanicula fills the gap as it sets you on an adventure that you can solve at your own pace, a way to save your home from an evil that’s never truly explained.\n\nI love the fact that Botanicula doesn’t explain everything. It makes the experience so much more innocent.

Great music and the atmosphere and non-verbal story-telling is really cool, similar to Machinarium (same devs) as far as characters speaking through picture speech bubbles. I like the contrast of the very vibrant, colorful, livid, lively, green environment and some parts where it's dying and a part close to the end when things get a bit dark, but no very heavy.\n*Would probably be great for children\n*Can run on very low-end computers\n\nCons\n*There are only a couple things that were really puzzles. Mostly I was just clicking a bunch of stuff watching all kinds of weird (yet entertaining) things happen before it gave me whatever item I needed to proceed at the time.\n*It's very abstract (which I like) and not really as much of a little world that Machinarium was, having really randomness to the different places and organisms you meet. Which I think Machinarium is a better game overall, telling a more cohesive narrative versus this game's sort of child drawing story (that could be taken as a negative or a positive).\n*The game was really short. I have 2.7 hours on this game and that was with clicking on everything I could find, though I didn't quite 100% it but I wasn't far off. I had little to no problem with the "puzzles" so I went through it pretty fast but even someone getting stuck a lot, if that's even possible, would still beat it fairly quickly. I think $10 is a bit pricey for a game that has little replay value and is so short.\n\nIn summary, this was an enjoyable experience especially at first glance at how wildly out there it was. It's a very sort kid's dream and occasionally nightmare with how abstract it is. But it was very short. I liked Machinarium more.","August 12, 2015","true","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

(Each of the cute little fellows has their own abilities to help overcome the challenges they encounter, though unfortunately they don't come into play more than a few times :/ Oh well, having a whole group of critters with you is still fun.)\n\nBotanicula is not your usual point-and-click, where you pixel hunt to progress. Instead you'll be searching around for all the cool little creatures that inhabit the world, simply because you *want* to. Seeing them move around and interact (and all the sounds they make!) is really enjoyable, even more so because of how completely optional it is.\n\nNeither will you have to worry about obtuse item combinations to proceed; quest items usually simply frame areas that you'll be exploring, without actually being difficult to collect. The primary difficulty/annoyance comes in the latter half of the game where there are multiple puzzles available at once and you're not sure in what order to do them. Your map is usually good (stylized line drawings on leaves!), although one area in the latter half of the game (the city) is just too jumbled (it's hard to tell where you've been and what's where).\n\nOverall, Botanicula is a great little game (~4 hours, if you explore like I do) with excellent art design, sound design, music, and atmosphere. The first half of the game is particularly good, because of its focus on the environment (both on the natural home of the critters and what's happening to it...); the latter half sort of breaks down on that with one area too cluttered (and discordant with the prior environments) and another too spread out, both too unfocused.\n\nI certainly enjoyed it, though, and I definitely recommend it (though for me the current $10 tag is a bit much; I got it on a Steam sale a while ago - but if you have money, throw it Amanita for me, ok? :P).\n\nBotanicula's certainly a game focused on aesthetics rather than gameplay, and I do love those.","November 10, 2012","true","4.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

I had to watch the walkthrough for a LOT of the puzzles (rather than rage quit!) and I did experience a bug or two, but restarting the game fixed the issue.

I say that with pretty full confidence in my gaming memory. Don’t get me wrong, strange does not by any stretch mean bad. In fact, Botanicula is one of the best games, if not the best, that I have played all year. I love nearly everything about it, down to the absolute simplicity of the story. It’s a tale that’s been done many times before, but never quite like this.\n\nA fantastic tree is the home for many wonderful creatures. Magical life seeds grow from every limb… seeds that allow beings on the tree to live in peace and harmony. One day, a dark entity, one greatly resembling a dark spider, comes and begins to ingest all of the seeds, drawing away all of the life and happiness that the tree houses. It is up to a small group of nuts, seeds, and feathers (yes, you heard me right) to save their home from this evil that has fallen upon them.\n\nIt’s an odd take on a classic story. Botanicula takes a step in a direction most games won’t take. They’ve assigned the main roles of their tale to a bunch on inanimate, absolutely regular objects that live in a world of what I can only describe as magic. When was the last time you saw a game that had a feather diving in and out of holes to solve puzzles? It’s a daring move… or just weird, depending on how you view it. It’s a pleasure to play something that’s different, even from most indie games.\n\nBotanicula is a point-and-click adventure game. This is a genre in which I am not very well versed. I’m ashamed to admit that I haven’t played some of the classics, like King’s Quest. Botanicula is more streamlined than traditional point-and-clicks, but that isn’t a bad thing. There was only one or two points in which I truly couldn’t figure out what to do, but sitting there for an hour stuck on one puzzle never got overly frustrating. I never felt like the game was calling me out for being an idiot. If I couldn’t figure out a puzzle and I needed to sit there and solve it without moving, the game wouldn’t do any unnecessary movements or sounds reminding me that I need to move on. I appreciated that more than I thought I would.\n\nBotanicula’s puzzles are a mixture of movement-based solving games, exploration, and fetch quests. Yeah, I know, a game having good fetch quests? Well, but that’s what the genre of point-and-clicks are partially about. I mean, a lot of what they’re about are trying to solve what piece of which goes where. And, if you go back even farther, they are also “how the hell do I pick up this god-forsaken crowbar?” Botanicula doesn’t do that. It doesn’t hold your hand or give you hints, but it gives you as much time as you need to solve a puzzle. You can’t die, you can only be knocked part of the way back. It’s a nice touch.\n\nExploration is one of the best things about Botanicula. Some areas are completely pointless to the actual puzzle or storyline, but they’re added just so you can experience the beauty that this game truly has to offer. As you look around the tree, you’ll find different creatures and beings that you can interact with. Some of these creatures will give you cards or a pretty display of some kind. Adding the collectable cards into the game gives meandering a purpose, beyond just being a wonderful and rather relaxing pleasure.\n\nI usually save the art design and music for last when I’m in a review, but I simply can’t avoid talking about it any longer. Everything about this game is flooring. Everything. From the silly little sound effects down to the horror that the environment gives you in the later levels. With the exception of Bastion and Badland, I’ve yet to see a game with this quality of art this year.\n\nThe music is just indescribable. Really, it’s quite difficult to do. Everything about it gives off a mystic sense, but none of it seems to fit in any one genre. It all sounds like it comes from the same source, which is excellently implemented, as the tree is the centerpiece for the entire game. The music will make you feel what you need to. If you need to feel accomplished in this scene, you will. If you need to feel terrified, you will. If you need to have a feeling of foreboding, believe me, you will. It’s one of the best soundtracks in any game I’ve ever played. Ever.\n\nThe game doesn’t have any real talking in it, and I’m 100% okay with that. Dialogue would add absolutely nothing to the game. The story will make you feel for the characters without the use of speech. Sure, there is some humming, or quiet gibberish, or squeals and gasps, but they’re varied and far between. They only happen when they need to. There is no fat in this game. All of it is cut out. You only get what you need; what you deserve.\n\nThe sound effects are just as appropriate as the music, clearly. The group you play as has their own sounds that they make, generally as a group. The other characters in the game all make different noises as well, and each one seems to fit the situation perfectly. Some of the sound effects are annoying, but that’s not a bad thing. Except for when you’re stuck on a puzzle in which you have to hear an annoying sound over and over and over.\n\nVisual art is arguably the best part of the game. It’s beautiful. It’s also quite psychedelic. Those two seem to go hand in hand when it comes to good games. Every area on the tree is fitting to the characters in it, and everything feels… right. It’s hard to explain, really. I suppose it’s one of those things that you just need to experience for yourself.\n\nThe group with which you play all have different abilities that you can use at certain points, but it’s very rare you do so. This is one of my few complaints with this game. You’re playing as a group of five, but you only use each character’s special properties once or twice. At the end of the game (spoilers) you have to rescue four of the five characters from the dark spider. I would care a lot more about saving them if I felt like each of them had their own personality, and I didn’t really feel that.\n\nSpeaking of the giant spiders, they are the perfect antagonist for a game like this. They’re scary, but not scary in the same sense that we humans would find terrifying. Instead they make the characters (and, by proxy, you) feel nervous and uneasy about what they are and why they’re doing what they are. They are silent as well. It’s never explained why the spiders are trying to engulf the tree with darkness, but I think that’s one of the beauties of this game.\n\nIn case I haven’t made it clear already, Botanicula doesn’t make much sense. It doesn’t have a pulling backstory like Bastion or a continuous reactionary setting like Badland, but it makes a perfect balance with these games. Badland makes a perfect quick and easy yet puzzling reaction game. Bastion makes you cry and seriously feel for the characters within it, as you help them fight their way back home. Botanicula fills the gap as it sets you on an adventure that you can solve at your own pace, a way to save your home from an evil that’s never truly explained.\n\nI love the fact that Botanicula doesn’t explain everything. It makes the experience so much more innocent. Everything about it makes you want to keep playing, makes you want to explore the homes of hundreds of creatures, makes you want to save your home from a masked villain. Botanicula proves that you don’t need a huge budget to make a game that is truly fantastic. Trying to choose the game of the year this year is going to be damned near impossible, because Botanicula gets a\n\n96/100\n\n- NJ\nIf you want to read more about Botanicula, visit our website\ntheoblivianstudios.com","February 13, 2014","true","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game lasts about six to seven hours (getting all achievements and such), all of which are amazing. Every interaction is full of life, emotion, and uniqueness - resulting in characters with more personality than ones in most AAA games. The characters and story rival those, if not exceed, of Machinarium's. Only "flaw" with the game is there are no puzzles or much challenge, and thus no real gameplay. This takes away any real replay value.\n\nOnly thing Botanicula can offer is character. Fortunately that's all you really need with this game.\n\nEdit: I take back the AAA dig - it's unfair.

The reason I didn't - I guess - was (apart from me hoping it would be in an indie bundle) that I couldn't imagine how gameplay would fit into this when I saw the trailer. And to be honest, the game doesn't exactly score with its gameplay mechanics; they have something browser-gamerish, even almost dilettant about them. But really, I couldn't care less. Because no game since... actually I cannot even think of any right now that ensorcelled (does that word really exist? O_o) me in such a way as this one (of course some other games à la Final Fantasy VII captivated me in very different ways).\n\nHow does this game manage to do this? With its apparant randomness - you never know what weird creature will come up next, how you will make it react and how it will react. In the end, however, it's not just pure "let's make everything totally crazy and random cuz that's cool"-randomness which one easily sees through; no, here pretty much everything fits together in this whimsical little world and you get the feeling that there must be something in the Czech culture that inspired to something that feels so odd and magical to us non-Czechs...I dunno.\n\nI guess one more aspect that makes this game so interesting is the simple fact that it's a world full of little animals and I for one was reminded of childhood days with adventurous atmosphere, catching little animals out of a pond and studying them and so on.\n\nBut all of this would not make it a good game if it wasn't for the wonderful graphics and sound design which also fit together perfectly. There is so much funny voice acting going on, so many eerie tunes (think Animal Collective + The Polyphonic Spree + chipmunks rubbing their butts over green grass) and the unique organic look of everything - it's just too much.\n\nSorry if I sound like a child ♥♥♥♥♥♥ on by a fairy but I just totally loved playing this ^^\n\nOf course, there are some flaws, like the simple gameplay, the shortness ( I WANT MOOOAR!), but what the heck - if you want perfectly polished games, go play EA stuff...this is one for the heart :}\n\nI'd even put it into my list of all-time-favorite games.\nHowever, I'm sure many wouldn't like it at all. Guess you'll just have to figure it out yourself ;)\n\n9/10\n\nPS: Sorry, this was long :P","January 4, 2013","true","4.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

You and your friend are various aspects of nature (a dragonfly, an acorn, etc), and are trying to save your tree world from the forces of evil - spiders. The puzzles challenge you to think more logically and consider nature/physics, as opposed to match-three or hidden object. No puzzle is so hard that it would make you rage quit.

Along the ride one must solve puzzles using the different abilities of the 5 characters.\n\nThe main strength of the game is how beautiful the art is. Everything seems hand-drawn and the animations reflect that, sometimes making movements very cut-out-ish. The music and the sound effects both complement that with very natural sounding tunes (as in involving individual sounds and hums rather than just musical instruments) and cute sounds from the environment (for example, when many different-sized bugs start humming a specific sound, the largest ones obviously humming in deep basses).\n\nThe puzzles are relatively simple on average, yet some of the later ones prove to be more complicated than you might imagine for what may strike one as a kid's game. What is unique about Botanicula's puzzles is that it is fun to see what will happen if you click on the wrong character. One problem that I have with the characters though, is that they seem like one entity, meaning it is hard to differentiate them based on their personalities.\n\nThis brings me on to how short the game is. It arguably contains 5 areas, each one longer than the one before it (which makes sense because you are moving your way down the tree, where the branches are progressively longer). The objective is to pass an obstacle blocking your passage to the next area by solving puzzles in the current area. There are many optional puzzles and things to click on which add to the completion rate on a playthrough, which does give access to additional content near the end based on how high it is. Even with that the game feels like one that should be completed in one playthrough, and, just like most point & clicks, there is no replay value in the game unless one did not achieve 100% completion.\n\nAll in all, Botanicula offers a short, but very charming and beautifully simple experience. Its simplicity can be both an upside and, at times, a downside.","February 10, 2015","true","5.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I have to admit that a few (very few) of the puzzles have stumped me, so he couldn't play it all by himself, and he is fairly smart for a three-year-old.  He made very clear to me that he did not care much for the villainous spiders in the game, but I think that was the point.  For children ages 5-10, I think this is a real treat.

(Each of the cute little fellows has their own abilities to help overcome the challenges they encounter, though unfortunately they don't come into play more than a few times :/ Oh well, having a whole group of critters with you is still fun.)\n\nBotanicula is not your usual point-and-click, where you pixel hunt to progress. Instead you'll be searching around for all the cool little creatures that inhabit the world, simply because you *want* to. Seeing them move around and interact (and all the sounds they make!) is really enjoyable, even more so because of how completely optional it is.\n\nNeither will you have to worry about obtuse item combinations to proceed; quest items usually simply frame areas that you'll be exploring, without actually being difficult to collect. The primary difficulty/annoyance comes in the latter half of the game where there are multiple puzzles available at once and you're not sure in what order to do them. Your map is usually good (stylized line drawings on leaves!), although one area in the latter half of the game (the city) is just too jumbled (it's hard to tell where you've been and what's where).\n\nOverall, Botanicula is a great little game (~4 hours, if you explore like I do) with excellent art design, sound design, music, and atmosphere. The first half of the game is particularly good, because of its focus on the environment (both on the natural home of the critters and what's happening to it...); the latter half sort of breaks down on that with one area too cluttered (and discordant with the prior environments) and another too spread out, both too unfocused.\n\nI certainly enjoyed it, though, and I definitely recommend it (though for me the current $10 tag is a bit much; I got it on a Steam sale a while ago - but if you have money, throw it Amanita for me, ok? :P).\n\nBotanicula's certainly a game focused on aesthetics rather than gameplay, and I do love those.","November 10, 2012","true","4.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

You want more? Okay. On the surface of it, Botanicula resembles a highly polished version of those online "click all around the screen and interesting things happen" Flash games. And I suppose that's exactly what it is. Unlike Machinarium, Amanita's previous big success, the focus here is less on solving minigames and more on encouraging interaction and exploration. With that in mind, this game is probably more suitable for younger players (although it does get quite dark towards the end) or casual gamers.\n\nThoroughly charming, with a beautiful setting, fantastic incidental music, memorable characters (who again, tell the entire story without a single line of dialogue) and wonderfully inventive set pieces make this a game well worth your time and effort.\n\nBe warned though, it does run on Adobe AIR so if you have problems with that particular application you may want to try the demo first.","November 18, 2014","true","4.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And they manage to tell an interesting and entertaining story without a single line of dialog (spoken or written).\n\nYes, the puzzles are noticeably easier than they were in Machinarium, but I feel like the puzzles aren't the point of the game. Rather, your goal is to explore this wonderful and whimsical world of cute little plant and bug creatures, all while trying to save their home from an encroaching monster.\n\nTo really get the most out of Botanicula, I strongly encourage you to scour every nook and cranny of the world, because there is always something special to be found.

Also, you can't move your characters directly here, they'll only move when you click to change a scene, or during some mini-puzzles where you need to find which character will get the job done.\n\nThe story:\nThe story revolves around a little party of creatures that accidentally find themselves protecting a small seed from a spider-like parasitic creature that's destroying their tree.

Definitely incomparable to Samorost and Machinarium, but still just as perfectly executed.

The creatures and environments are beautiful, the soundtrack and voices are so nice, that even when the story line is slightly creepy (a bunch of spider-like creatures are threatening the inhabitants of the Botanicula tree and a couple of seeds must do the saving) even the darkest episodes are full of charm and good vibes.\n\nThe game is a point and click with not much difficulty. Most of the puzzles can be solved with a little logic or even by simply trying what you can click on. To unlock all secrets and Steam achievements, some more skill-luck-persistence will be required (I am actually stuck with the Svolavac one; I know what I´m supposed to do but I havent found the right combo yet).\n\nI enjoyed the game so much that I re-started it just to see if I could get all the achievements. I´ve gone through it 3 times now and have only used hints for Svolavac, but I have taken longer on the 2 later runs because I am taking my time enjoying the scenery and soundtrack, the humorous interactions and the frog concert.\n\nI would recommend this game to anyone who likes original design, to anyone who appreciates audio-visual artwork, to anyone who likes plants and insects, point and click games or to anone who is simply looking for a unique and stress-less game.","January 4, 2015","true","7.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Along the ride one must solve puzzles using the different abilities of the 5 characters.\n\nThe main strength of the game is how beautiful the art is. Everything seems hand-drawn and the animations reflect that, sometimes making movements very cut-out-ish. The music and the sound effects both complement that with very natural sounding tunes (as in involving individual sounds and hums rather than just musical instruments) and cute sounds from the environment (for example, when many different-sized bugs start humming a specific sound, the largest ones obviously humming in deep basses).\n\nThe puzzles are relatively simple on average, yet some of the later ones prove to be more complicated than you might imagine for what may strike one as a kid's game. What is unique about Botanicula's puzzles is that it is fun to see what will happen if you click on the wrong character. One problem that I have with the characters though, is that they seem like one entity, meaning it is hard to differentiate them based on their personalities.\n\nThis brings me on to how short the game is. It arguably contains 5 areas, each one longer than the one before it (which makes sense because you are moving your way down the tree, where the branches are progressively longer). The objective is to pass an obstacle blocking your passage to the next area by solving puzzles in the current area. There are many optional puzzles and things to click on which add to the completion rate on a playthrough, which does give access to additional content near the end based on how high it is. Even with that the game feels like one that should be completed in one playthrough, and, just like most point & clicks, there is no replay value in the game unless one did not achieve 100% completion.\n\nAll in all, Botanicula offers a short, but very charming and beautifully simple experience. Its simplicity can be both an upside and, at times, a downside.","February 10, 2015","true","5.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I was sad when I'd completed it as I was so absorbed in the game I didn't realise how much time had passed. It's so beautiful. It filled me with child-like wonder yet sometimes I felt slightly fearful. The narrative is very simple but you never know what's going to happen next. I love that it was constantly surprising me as a player, in playful & quirky way. I loved how the landscape & characters were almost abstract. The game is simple, with few explanations, so you can invent your own backstory. It almost has paved a new way for puzzle solving 'langauge' in terms of the use of physics & sound in order to solve it. Puzzle games are my favourite and this stumped me quite a lot, as I was thinking about how it would be solved in other adventure games. It was excellent at throwing me off what I thought I had to do it. It was frustrating at certain times but it's great when you figure it out finally.  Overall this was an amazing game & I can't wait to see what this company does next.","February 18, 2015","true","12.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It does not open up any new frontiers and it will not burn your brain attempting to solve the puzzles. If you are looking for a deep gaming experience, look elsewhere.\n\nThis game will appeal to people who appreciate the idea of games-as-art; not necessarily deep commentaries that "have something to say" about social issues, but rather just as works of reflection, crafted by a creator who actually cares about the work he is producing. This game is ugly and beautiful at the same time, strangely compelling in its own way, and I felt rewarded when I had completed it. Not really for the sake of the game's story (rudimentary and nebulous at best), but for the sake of having experienced something that I knew came directly from the mind of another human being to my own.
