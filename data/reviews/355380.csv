It's a 3D duel of spellcasters, with a Buddhist theme. Therefore it is a super niche game. The only other games which remind me of Perfect Wisdom are Spectromancer and Astral Masters. However, those two games have many more hours of potential playing time. Perfect Wisdom is shorter.\n\nGet the free demo and play out a few games, and you should either be sold on it or not.\n\nIf you like it, the game needs word of mouth to build up the community and active multiplayer games.\n\nThe arcade mode is a story mode where you choose your character and must defeat all the others.\nThe AI mode is for quick 12 minute diversions during your day, I was surprised that there are detailed stats after each battle.\n\nThe price is a little high but an indie developer needs all the money he or she could get.\n\nNot sure if there will be more characters or modes down the road or DLC. As it stands now, I wish there was a longer mode, but I wanted to reward the developer with the innovation and theme shown here (Buddhism + Tarot + Magic = awesomeness to me!). It is a shame that the English translation still isn't perfect, and that I had to read the instructions many times to understand gameplay, even with pictures.\n\nGameplay: There are a handful of characters who have their own specific decks. There is no deck building and it is not a CCG. The cards become active based on player's location on board, and how many points have been stored. There are three sets- attack, defense, and buff. Each player chooses attack and defense for each turn, and the winner of the two draws is determined by a rock-paper-scissors approach. This is much deeper than it sounds and there is strategy involved when it comes to selecting lower level spells vs higher level for rock-paper-scissors. Players could pick up points by moving or teleporting on the board.","June 8, 2015","true","8.7"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"
