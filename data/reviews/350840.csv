Do not buy, this game should be considered early access.\n\nI will go into depth about my short time playing. I will note I recently played evolve at maximum settings holding 60 fps.\n\nI start out in a short intro film, reminded me a lot of conkors bad fur day, screen pans in on your face, suddenly there is a loud bang, and you awake. You are told to go see the warlock, and given first person perspective. It tells you WASD is to move, W works fine, A and D seem to barely work, making you do a almost unnoticable sidestep. You basically move holding W and looking around. There are some potions you can grab but I was unable to get the inventory to open to use them. You walk outside and see a battle, between well armed skeletons and some blockheaded zombies. There is a board telling you combat keys, however none of my attack keys would work. I noticed a glwoing area telling me I could purchase a forge for 1500 gold, then continued up the hill to the warlock. I went to the warlock and he looks like a pretty high level skeleton. He basically says "♥♥♥♥ I knew this would happen but did nothing anyways and now someone will save us but I dont know who so lets just sit and wait for him to do it." and you go "kay" and go back home.\n\nSpoiler alert\n\n\n\n****************************(((((((you decide to be the hero)))))))**************************************\n\nSecond update. The combat boils down to simple hack and slash against large groups of mobs, the game seems to be open world, but also seems to rip a lot of assets off from skyrim. In fact it kind of seems like a crappy skyrim mod. I dont mean to sound meen, and I am sure the dev tried, but really this game is early access. You spam click to kill mobs and it is not very satisfying.","February 16, 2015","false","0.4"," 97 of 119 people (82%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","82","97","119","15","7"

The controls are all over the place, the fight system is just the typical hack & slash. If you have 2 monitors enjoy trying to play the game when in minimises it because cursor goes off onto other screen. The questline need changing big time and also the music was good at first but it just keeps playing on and on! I could not even go into my options to change the graphics or resolution.\n\n\nPlease sort out your game! Otherwise this should be scrapped and peoples money should be rufunded until you fix everything.","February 17, 2015","false","0.3"," 50 of 58 people (86%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","86","50","58","6","4"

It's like trying to control a zombie with a broken knee. Words can not describe how bad the controls are in tis game. And the LAG! MY GAWD THE LAG! My GTX 970 didn't do anything for the lag! This game looks like it's trying to copy Skyrim....This game is NOT skyrim. Do not buy.","October 31, 2015","false","0.8"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

I initially found a lot of the controls and accessing and using menu options oddly configured, but nothing all that hard to adjust to and I don’t even remember what most of the issues were.  Inventory and graphics options work fine but it did take me a couple of minutes to figure it out.\n\nI agree that the A & D movement keys do not work as advertised – a double tap will give you a roll to the left and right but I couldn’t see any discernable movement just holding them down.  But I also never found any place where it mattered to the gameplay.  Circle strafing not required in combat!\n\nAt the default graphics settings the game played horribly on my rig.  After I adjusted the settings the game still looked really good and played fine EXCEPT 1) in Runetown, near the water, when there are a lot of NPCs around, during a thunderstorm and 2) a timed run through some caverns with combat and ledges to fall off and a companion to keep alive who was suicidal and not much good in a fight.  Better framerates would be an improvement obviously but the game runs fine as is.\n\nThis is a huge world with very nice graphics and a lot of places to discover and many, many quests to complete.  Unlike a lot of other games, including ones that are reviewed very favorably, there are very few invisible walls that restrict your movement.  The boundaries are almost always real world objects like mountains or walls.  If it looks like you should be able to reach something, you can.  It might be pointless at times but I like to explore thoroughly rather than just following roads or waiting for the next quest icon to appear at the top of the screen.  Sometimes you find stuff.  Sometimes you struggle to get to the top of an almost impossible to reach mountain peak and your only reward is some clipping because the game creators got a little careless since most people would have taken the hint and given up.\n\nThe only thing I do not like about the game is the puzzles.  Either they suck or I suck at puzzles.  Either way, too much of my playing time was spent solving them.  Many I solved through trial and error and once I figured them out, I would look back at the clue and still have no idea how it should have helped me solve it.\n\nBut some time in the next few days I will paste my notes into a game guide.  It won’t be anything pretty but at least you’ll have some solutions if you don’t have the intelligence (spelled p a t i e n c e) to solve them on your own.\n\nThere were also a few glitches or poor design decisions.\n\nAt the beginning of the game, I did everything I could find in Bonetown and there were all these inaccessible doors and I thought it was a really short and crappy game.  But retraced my steps looking for something I might have missed and eventually went back inside the house where the game starts and when I exited there was a quest activated.  No idea if this was a glitch or planned that way but either way, guessing some people would have just quit which is unfortunate.\n\nAnd in the Ghetel and on Rune Island, I had to save the game and reload it in order to activate events that you needed to complete the quest/location.\n\nI’ll spell things out more in the guide.\n\nAlso worth noting that at about 70% completion, credits rolled which normally indicates the end of the game.  But you can keep playing.  Currently I am stuck at 78% completion because I can’t figure out the latest in the series of never-ending puzzles.  But I’ll add it to the guide when I do figure it out!\n\nTo sum up.  A flawed game with some questionable design decisions but which is still a lot of fun to play.\n","February 3","true","196.0"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"
