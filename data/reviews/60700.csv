Unfortunately, it was obtuse and not very responsive. The tutorial really didn't get much across and even when it did tell you to do something, it didn't seem to do it when I clicked the things it told me to. Perhaps this requires more patience than I'm willing to afford it, but this is in no way worth $10, from my limited experience.","August 16, 2014","false","0.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Once you "get it", you can beat the game in one sitting with a few or no losses. There are 12 levels, each one taking from 6-15 minutes to win. Multiplayer is dead. Highscore tracking is broken. Mediocre music and sound but they work. You can upgrade your robots (speed, strenght, accuracy, etc.); I suggest you start upgrading once you have 400 fuel so you can have a few robots ready to go. Always send your robots in groups, 4-5, the last robot in the group being the Recycler.\n\nAgain, once you find out how to play, you might find it satisfying and worth the money (I wouldn't pay over $3 for it).","November 29, 2014","true","15.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It's kind of a tower wars type map. You get about 6 robots that you assign weapons to and they walts across the screen a few times to get to the other side. If they make it to the other side, you get a point. 10 points wins. There are various upgrades and the core way to gain money is by giving a robot the "looter" weapon so that they can "salvage wrecks". As the robots crawl across the screen they shoot at each other.\n\nOn paper it doesn't sound so horrible, but the game is unbelivably poor.","December 29, 2010","false","0.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

After a start-up, a bug occured causing none of my top statistics to update, but I decided to play the game anyway. I don't think there really is a point to this game, you can send robots, when they die you need to have a special class robot clean them up to get the in-game currency. This continued for like 20 minutes before I ended up losing. I did everything right, sent my groups in teams of 5, sometimes more. I was outplaying the enemy, but somehow the game still decided they were the victor.\n\nThe graphics are unappealing, as is the music. I had a hard time finding anything really great about this game, even the tutorial narrator was just annoying, boring, and unpleasant.","November 6, 2015","false","0.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

When I tell you this is a game to pass on, hopefully you will listen.\n\nIt's in interesting take on the "Tug of War" style defense games where you stream out units that clash in the center. But instead clashing in the same lane, each side has it's own lane. Well I tried it. And it doesn't work. There's no strategy involved. No unit countering. No gambling on holding back units for an upgrade while tanks hold back the assault.\n\nMaybe there was something here ... but it's so poorly balanced and playtested that it is pure frustration and disapointment.","October 14, 2014","false","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'm a big fan of the tower-defense type games, and thought I'd give this a try. In essence, your units progress up the 'board' while the enemy units move down the screen towards you. When they are in opposing aisles, they can open fire on each other.\n\nNow herein lies the most pointless aspect of the game. Start off and both you and the opposing team have EXACTLY the same three type of robots to build. Both you and the opposing team have EXACTLY the same upgrades to purchase. And both your own robots and those of the opposition move at EXACTLY the same speed (without unlock). So in a nutshell - it's a race to meet in the middle - at exactly the same time with exactly the same units with exactly the same kit. The result? A 51/49% split in success.\n\nGranted, the game is much more fun with the appeal of upgrades and working out what works well and where - but its too long and boring to even get there!","June 8, 2011","false","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
