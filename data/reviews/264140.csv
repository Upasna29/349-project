The addition of new features is a pipe dream that will likely never come true.  Over a year ago the original devs were promising all sorts of things ("Both seamonsters AND weather are already on the drawing board. Expect them within a month or so!" - December 2013).  None of these things happened and were lies.\n\nThe game has Three locations and that is it.  Islands, where you kill anyone on it.  Sea battles, where you just board a ship or shoot it.  Town islands, where you buy things and hire new pirates.  At the start the game is pretty fun until you realise this is literally all there is to the game, the mechanics do not develop, new things are not introduced.  You will do the same thing you did in hour 1 in hour 100 (Other than shoot cannons).  Cannon fights are ridiculous, you could spend tens of hours collecting a crew, training them, equipping them and yet in a single cannon fight many of them will die, making all your hard work pointless.\n\nThere is no real plot.  No real characters.  The music is average.  The graphics are frankly lazy, every island is the same and the background for the world is always the same.  The gameplay is basic (You order your entire crew with 1 click..you cannot individually select) and it does not develop.  Frankly, the Devs should be ashamed for cashing in on an idea and then abandoning it, breaking hundreds of promises they made and hiring some random guy to do little more than take the blame.\n\nDon't buy the game, the developers don't deserve the money and it sends out the wrong message if you do so.\n\nEdit: After announcing they were making a new game and seeing the negative reception it got, they announced a "free redux edition" for the game a week later, in an attempt to win back fans.   This doesn't change my review.  The game is still currently poor, was released unfinished and it's taken the dev 6 months of silence before announcing anything.\n\nA games review is a review of the game; not future promises.","October 11, 2014","false","9.8"," 1,735 of 2,016 people (86%) found this review helpful 28 people found this review funny","86","735","2","28","52"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Auburok/recommended/264140/","Auburok","Auburok","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Auburok/","581 products in account","I played this a bunch when my internet was out since it was relatively small (~200 MB) and wouldn't kill my phone's data plan to tether and install. Because of this, my time played isn't accurate - I have about another 10 hours in this game and currently on day 13 of my second save.\n\nAnyway, on with this. First off, there's a lot to like here:\n\n-Pirates\n-Roguelike\n-Customizeable crew and ship\n-Characters level up, have equipment and skills\n-Freeform exploration\nBut it's just not very good. I waited until it was out of "early access" in hopes to avoid a lot of problems, but alas, here I am. Anyway, the bad:\n\n-Only the captain is able to follow orders directly - group orders for crew is haphazard at best.\n-Crew that learn skills for the ship (cooking, cleaning) will do them on their own accord. In other words: even if the food stores are full of uncooked food and you have a cook, if he's too busy punting ♥♥♥♥ off the side of the ship he won't go near it. This has improved with 1.0.5, but can still be an issue for pirates with multiple skills for the ship.\n-Cooks sometimes won't cook food. So your ship starves to death for absolutely no reason. As it stands in my save now I have around 40 in fish that's uncooked in barrels, with 3 cooks refusing to do anything. (This has been fixed as of 1.0.5 - pirates that don't have the ability to fish or clean but can cook will now do so)\n-Multiple crew with the "cleaning" skill doesn't make the job go faster. They all scuttle after the same turd and fight over it.\n-Managing more than a few crew is a nightmare when it comes to moral and hunger.\n-"Animals" tend to charge in to battle. This includes chickens you're rasing for eggs. They don't survive long, and don't listen to orders very well. This makes capturing animals borderline pointless because they will suicide at the first chance they get when your ship gets boarded.\n-Custom ship designs tend to screw up pathfinding for your crew. Expect to get stuck. A lot. Don't worry, though! If you grind your ship down to a nub it'll probably fix. Also, the dimensions aren't clear. You'll be building this sweet skiff and all of a sudden you're unable to build in a direction anymore, so you have to restart your design taking in to account this invisible wall. I'd like a grid or something, please.\n-It's easier to pump up a captain and have him handle mobs of enemies, since he listens to orders.\n-Combat, both island and ship to ship is largely "rinse and repeat". Cannons are fired in a short volley and then sides clash. Fun for the first few hours, gets kind of grating. No events or anything to speak of so far, at least in my playthroughs.\n-Many of the items found don't work properly. Sushi, for example.\n-The sound effects get old real quick. "JOLLY ROGER. JOLLY ROGER. JOLLY ROGER. JOLLY ROGER."\n-The inventory gets cumbersome when you pick up a lot of items. It requires a trip to the store to be able to see all of the things you're carrying.\n-Bounty hunter dialogs are slow and interrupt the player when walking around town. Yes, I know I'm on a "quest", stop telling me. On top of that, bounties don't have a set range, and sailing 30 tiles on the map for a bounty is silly.\n-Pirates aside from captain will render behind the pirate ships, making it very difficult to track your party. New pirates added to the crew after this bug happens will render properly. There is no way to revert the bug via loading or restarting the game. http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=295086852\n-Cannons end up severing parts of the ship you're firing at, which makes boarding a problem since pirates can't cross "destroyed" tiles.\n-I beat the four legendary pirates, but one of the encounters didn't have a captain. I can't "beat" the game with this save now as I had no prompt for beating the four pirates and the bay I'm looking for was never marked or mentioned after doing so.\nMost of this would be better without the bugs, so there's at least hope that'll be enjoyable in the future. Wait for them to fix the game; don't bother with a discount if the problems never get ironed out because it's really frustrating to play a game that is mostly "difficult" due to bugs. Like I said: I was hoping this game wouldn't be the bug-fest I heard it was when they finally pushed out of "early access", but that's not the case.\n\nI'll update this review as things change.","August 1, 2014","false","6.7"," 920 of 1,149 people (80%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","80","920","1","6","15"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DiceeciD/recommended/264140/","DiceeciD","Never Let It End","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DiceeciD/","173 products in account","So normally I would write a more concise review analyzing a game, and looking at all the good parts of it but also all of it's faults. Pixel Piracy is this special case where I absolutely adore the concept it delivers and the gameplay, but the execution is so god damn awful I can't bring myself to play it anymore, I wanted to play it to the end and explore everything, have a massive powerful crew that would dominate the seven seas. Instead we're left with a game that, to put it simply, is badly made. It doesn't work, and yet it 'released' mere days ago. Anyway, here's a list of about everything wrong with this game that will ruin your experience. Some issues may not seem important but do realize that all of them create unfair situations where the player is not at fault and yet the game will end up punishing them anyway or worse, just straight up giving them a situation they cannot get out of because of the god awful AI. So, here's the list.\n\n-Crew members acknowledge orders for maybe 1 second before ignoring it and going back to doing something that will probably get them killed or worse\n\n-Categorizing Crew members doesn't help much because giving them orders is a waste of time when they continue to do whatever the hell they want anyway. This can lead to crew members with no combat experience or health running out against high level pirates for no good reason. The above point also means that no matter how many times you try to move the low level crew member away from combat, they'll still just run back in and get themselves killed.\n\n-Your designated cook refuses to cook because you gave him a secondary job role and he's decided that's more important than cooking food for the captain or any of your crew which leads to the unfair death of you or your crew for no good reason other than the fact your cook decided that patching up the tiny bit of damage the ship took is more important than keeping the crew alive. The same goes for the cook having other jobs like Fishing. The same also happens if they're using interactable furniture like a Card set or Set of Swords. Apparently getting that straight flush is more important than helping your captain not starve to death. The same issue can also occur just from having your ship docked at an island, I don't know why it just bloody does.\n\n-Crew members who refuse to eat even when he's starving to death and you do actually have supplies of food. This relates to the above problem, if they have any kind of job or they're interacting with something menial, they will refuse to eat even when they're low on health because of starvation. This leads to numerous deaths.\n\n-Having multiple people who use cannons and multiple cannons and yet all of the crew members will use the same single cannon which makes it completely redundant, also half of the time a person who can use cannons simply won't for no reason\n\n-Crewmembers in combat refusing to target the enemy you picked for more than a second before choosing their own choice, which most of the time is the enemy with the most health instead of focusing down the person you just spent the last 30 seconds wittling down.\n\n-Ultimate skills are trash, it's impossible to tell when they're actually being used and that's because most of the time they're never being used, they're pointless and in 30 hours of playing I have only seen a crew member use one once, and it was useless\n\n-Selling cargo is useless and yields such a pathetic amount of gold. This is a game based around piracy, where people stole cargo from others to explot for themselves or sell for riches. In this however, you can steal hundreds of weapons, food and all sorts of other stuff and your reward for doing so is 1 gold per weapon no matter how powerful it is.\n\nPixel Piracy is one of the most annoying games I have ever played. It doesn't listen. I don't think I've ever had to complain about a game not listening to me, where the AI is so brain dead that the simplest of concepts is beyond them, and it always ends up punishing you, for the developers misgivings. I can't recommend this game, please don't buy it in it's current state. This review was written as of version 1.0.4\n\nAlso it took them all the way til 1.0.0 to add quest markers.\n\nReally?","August 2, 2014","false","32.3"," 483 of 635 people (76%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","76","483","635","3","5"

I wanted to try it for a half hour or so last night before bedtime (10pm), but I couldn't put it down till 4am. Today I'm writing this review at work, and I'm super tired after just a few hours of sleep (probably won't get a lot done today). And yet...\n\nI REGRET NOTHING!!!!\n\nI have been a gamer for 20+ years, played countless indie games, and I can tell you that this game (even in early access/alpha) is a true gem. In terms of fun and addictiveness, I would rank this game right up there with other indie classics who I've spent hundreds of hours with: like Terraria, Hotline Miami, To The Moon, and Faster Than Light.\n\n\nHERE ARE A FEW THINGS TO NOTE IF YOU ARE CONSIDERING BUYING THIS GAME:\n- Are there bugs?\nIf you would consider a high level of difficulty, steep learning curve, and a lackluster tutorial to be "bugs," then sure there are bugs. It seems to me like that's the only bugs people are talking about. "OMG I died in my first encounter, so buggy." "I can't figure out how to do anything, too many bugs." THOSE AREN'T BUGS. In my first 5 or 6 hours of play, I only encountered one actual bug: the game froze up a bit, but I lost no progress as I was able to re-load.\n\n- What's it like?\nPixel Piracy borrows a lot from other successful, indie roguelikes. It's actually like a mix between Faster Than Light, Terraria, and Sword of the Stars: The Pit. It borrows a lot of concepts from all three games, adds in a few new ideas, and throws it all together in a pirate setting.\nYou travel the world in search of crew, plunder, ship parts, and weapons until you have the most powerful ship in the sea (or galaxy, like Faster Than Light). You travel around a randomized world map in your ship, you click on a spot on the map where there could be a special event, an island, a town, an enemy ship, and etc. Once you have traveled there, that opens up some new spots on the map to explore, and the further out you go, the harder it gets (and there's better plunder). In battle, you have 3 options: flee, blow them away from a safe distance, or board their ship and fight em' up close. All of that is very much like FTL.\nBut unlike FTL, you must build your own custom ship block by block, from the hull to the sails it's all in your hands. This reminds me a lot of building a house in Terraria; there are a lot of things that you will put in your home/ship that have a very specific use and function of course (cannons, ladders, lamps, barrels), but you always end up spending even more time making it look cool, right? Also, there are bosses (huge ships full of bloodthirsty pirates and cannons) on every map. It would be most unfortunate if you just randomly came across them and died, but you are able to see very clearly where they are on the map. Terraria also has many bosses that you can choose to fight when you feel that you're ready.\nWhat ship would be fit to sail without a crew? In Pixel Piracy, you must learn to expertly manage a crew of dangerous, unruly, mangy pirates. I can't imagine how that could ever be an easy task. You must keep them fed, paid, happy, clean, and safe. If you fail at any of these task, things will not go well for you. In my opinion, it's much more profitable to train them and keep them alive than it is to replace them. You are also in charge of leveling up and maintaining each individual crew member's abilities: putting points into certain traits, training them to learn new skills, and equipping them with weapons, armor, and items. If anyone reading this has ever played Sword of the Stars: The Pit, all of this should be sounding familiar. Except that you have a whole crew to manage instead of just your captain.\n\n- Just how "Roguelike" is it exactly?\nAlthough it has a lot of FTL (and SPAZ) features like a procedurally generated maps, randomized encounters, and permanent deaths, you can still reload your save from before you died. So even though you don't respawn after death (like Terraria), you also don't die and completely lose all of your progress (like FTL). This is probably a good middle ground to be in for this particular game. Considering that you will spend a LOT more time in Pixel Piracy customizing/upgrading your crew/ship than you would in FTL (which is a shorter game by nature), it's nice that you can re-load your previous save after you're killed in a CRAB BATTLE (not even kidding, those freakin' crabs will drown you man). But at the same time, there is no such thing as a roguelike with respawns. Roguelikes are all about making tough, strategic, and irreversible decisions. If you could just respawn after death, it would completely ruin the whole experience. I wouldn't even be opposed to your save file being erased after death like other roguelikes, but I'm just masochistic like that.\n\n- What tips do I have for you?\nDon't look anything up. Watch the trailer, look at the screenshots, read the game description, check out a few reviews... then just start playing and don't look back. Don't alt-tab to google and try to search for all the answers, FIGURE IT OUT. I'll admit, a game that doesn't spell everything out for you and hold your hand through the early stages is indeed very old fashioned. This is one of those old school games where you learn by trial and error. How do I get my crew to clean up all this poop on the ship? How do I keep them fed? How do I take on ships that are bigger than mine? FIGURE IT OUT. When you highlight certain items, the description may not necessarily tell you what it does. So buy it and find out. When you come across an island with some shady looking characters you've never seen before, you may not be sure if you can take them or not. Well it's a roguelike, so YOLO. What does that shrine do? What does that potion do? What does that ability/skill do? Try it and find out; it's a lot more fun to learn it on your own.\n\n- Should I buy this game?\nYES","March 14, 2014","true","7.7"," 369 of 480 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","369","480","0","11"

There are bugs, and you should expect from an Early Access game, but most of these can be avoided. When you begin a new game, you start on an island with everything you need to get started: a tavern to hire people; a weapons shop to buy better weapons; a food shop to buy some basic food; and a ship building shop where you can buy blocks to be used for your ship. You also start with enough blocks to build a small raft, which will be your ship for until you want to spend the money for more blocks (or by pillaging conquered ships). Using your first small raft, you and your early crew will pillage islands and ships to gather gold and supplies, which can be used to hire more crew, buy food, etc. While you explore the seas, you will come across inhabited islands that have services you can buy from (these islands are identified by a special icon). These islands will often have materials you couldn't find on other islands; for example, a cannon can't be bought on the starting island, but a few other islands may have some for purchase. The same applies to foods, parts, weapons, and crew members. There are various professions that crew members may have. Sailors are needed to keep the ship clean; fighters have bonuses when attacking; cooks prepare raw foods into better quality foods; first mates will take over the ship if the captain dies, allowing you to keep playing if you die; and there are many more, all having unique abilities that will keep your ship running and the gold coming in. Each crew member also has special traits that affect their strengths and weaknesses; some traits are good (loyal, gunslinger, etc.) and others aren't as helpful (traitor, weak, etc.). Each crew member, including yourself, have an inventory that consists of an item slot (where you can add armor, extra ammo, self-destruct bombs, etc.), a weapon slot, where you can add one of the various types of melee weapons (cutlasses, short swords, spears, etc.) and another slot for an additional weapon, either an extra melee weapon or a ranged weapon (pistol, throwing knife, etc.). The crew is also going to be one of your main problems: you need to pay them. And some crew member will require a lot of pay to keep them happy. But by pillaging enough ships and islands, you should be able to keep up with the expense. Just keep in mind that this game is unforgiving: if the captain dies, the game is done, and you need to restart from the beginning (though a recent update at the time of this review added a mode where dying doesn't delete the save).\n\nI would rate this game an 7/10.\n\n+ Lots of fun to be had.\n+ The graphics complement the feeling of the game.\n+ Customizable ships and crew.\n\n- Some bugs, but this isn't really a bad thing, this being an Early Access game.\n- Could be very frustrating, depending on your attitude.","December 22, 2013","true","12.8"," 244 of 307 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","244","307","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jacqland/recommended/264140/","jacqland","Jacq","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jacqland/","350 products in account","I'm surprised this isn't Early Access, as it feels incomplete as-is and suffers a few game-breaking bugs. Skills and items, like Ship Repair and Chicken Nests, are obviously not finished/implemented into the game. There are also a few odd design choices that affect the game balance. Certain buffs are able to be applied to all crew members and stack, therefore making the game an odd one where it gets exponentially easier as it goes on. The first island should not feel more difficult than the final boss(es), imo.\n\nGameplay wise, it's surprisingly similar to FTL. The ship combat and map, at least, have a lot of the same feel. You hire crew (which you have to keep healthy, happy, and fed), and you sail around plundering. There are three location types in the game - islands, towns, and other ships. Within those three, there are a few different flavours (cannibals or hags on islands, big ships or little ships, towns wih differing supplies). With the exception of a few bounty hunter fetch quests, and an option at the beginning to toggle a plague (which I didn't), there are no other events or surprises in the game. It starts to feel remarkably similar after a while, but more content should be on the way. The goal is to beat up progressively tougher opponants for progressively better loot, until you fight the final four bosses (conveniently spread WAY OUT across the huge map). Defeat them, and you get a cute song and the ability to continue playing. I'd suggest watching the cute song on Youtube and buying FTL.\n\nAbout 14 hours to complete Campaign mode on Beginner settings. I'd say around 3 of those hours (at least) was spent sailing - ie browsing the web in Steam's overlay, and closer to 8 hours if you don't count restarting after bugs/crashes (e.g. reloading caused my first mate to become captain while my captain was still alive, neither could progress).\n\nAll that said, it's not a BAD game. I enjoyed it, but have no desire to play it any longer as is. When it's done, it'll probably be a pretty fun open world pirate sim. It definately has charm and personality. Certainly it's not worth the price right now, in Oct 2014. Check it out in a year and see where it's at.","October 11, 2014","false","14.7"," 281 of 363 people (77%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","77","281","363","6","0"

I for one find it very fun.\n\n+ I really enjoy how you get to build your own pirate ship out of parts you plunder or buy. It is very fun to do that and you can take pride in your ship, but also you can capture other ships you find and abandon your creation.\n\n+ Another great aspect is how you get to hire your own crew. There are tons of randomly generated people on the islands to hire and it is basically like having a follower in an RPG game, but you control them at the same time.\nThe exploration is pretty great and very enjoyable, through finding peaceful islands to ones swarming with hostile natives, or attacking enemy ships on the seas. You can find great loot almost always which is a good incentive to keep exploring, so you can upgrade your ship more.\n\n+  A cool aspect is food management, so you have to make sure you stop by some main islands every now and then to get food for your crew. It keeps things realistic and there are times where you can be in a pickle, having to get back fast for food in the beginning. Later on though you can be able to keep a large amount of food on ship so it isn't as much of a problem.\n\n+The areas are rated on a scale of 1-10 for difficulty, so you know where to explore and where to go if you want a challnge. A bigger challenge means bigger rewards, like getting better plunder from an enemy ship (or you could just capture it). However it would be difficult to defeat the enemy pirates and natives to get to that point anyway, so it is mostly just a good way to see how the difficulty progresses until you get to the final 4 (ranked 10).\n\nHowever, there are some negetives to this game, but nothing major stood out.\n\n- The controls and how to play weren't explained very well, but it isn't that hard to figure out and a quick google search every now and then in the beggining could fix my problems, like how to feed myself and my crew.\n\n- The combat is pretty weak. I personally don't mind it, but you just click on enemies and your people attack them. It can be a little boring combat wise from just having your crew do thigns on their own with no input by you, by you can control who they attack and if you want them to go somehwere during fights.\n\n- There isn't much depth to the game other than to explore and plunder to get a bigger and better ship and more crew. The journey to get there is fun, but once you get there and clear all the enemies, you probably have to start a new character to continue having a challenge.\n\nOverall, I'd give this game a 7.5/10. It is worth the $10 I'd say, but I would reccomend holding out for a sale or using one of those coupons. It is very fun to explore and battle and customizing your ship and crew is something I really enjoy.","January 6, 2015","true","9.9"," 177 of 218 people (81%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","81","177","218","6","0"

They refuse to jump off as well;\n- Game despawning he island before despawning the actors when changing scenes from island to open sea. May be easily exploited by approaching the same island several times - after 3 or 4 times all island actors will be drowned;\n- Crew suddenly clipping through the hull and drowning for no obvious reason;\n- Crew attempting to "clean" their crewmates by kicking them off the ship;\n- PRESS SPACE TO INTERACT above all other windows, including the tutorial window;\n- When playing on low resolutions, long lists of the goods for sale will be offscreen;\n- Gunners loading the cannons with bombs endlessly. My personal record - 19 bombs loaded in a single cannon;\n- many others I did not mention.\n\nBalance issues:\n-Game difficulty wildly varies and even with 15+ crew with highly trained skills and above 50+ lvl I tend to avoid 5lvl+ encounters, since at least five of my crew tends to die during those encounters;\n- Rate of morale and hunger decrease varies wildly from version to version;\n- There is literally no new content in shops of lvl 5 and higher. Since you visited the lvl 4 shop - you saw everything that game has to offer you. Max level of shops are 8, by the way;\n- Crew tends to do everything, but not the things you need them to do. Fishermen will train, new pirates will just idle and cooks prioritise cleaning over cooking which quickly leads to crew starving cause fish was not caught, new pirates in crew dying in first encaunter since training areas occupied by slacking fishermen and once again crew starving to death while there are tons of uncooked food on board. And there is literally nothing you can do about it;\n- A single crew member can capture the 8lvl+ ship with proper equipment and training. At this point I just reverted back to captain-solo gameplay on a little boat, discarding all the crew.\n\nDeleted features:\n-Food no longer spawn on enemy ships for whatever reason;\n-Shackles are available for purchase in shop, promising the ability to capture prisoners during the boarding. Function was never implented, yet the item exists;\n- Social encounters, featuring the change of relationship between your crew.\n\nI could add much more to this list, but I am just done. I have no more willpower to force myself through this horrible and frustrating experience.\nThis is not a proper release, it is just developers feeding off the release status hype and discounts related to it.\nThose slackers are so bold that they even show it as something great and to achieve - look at the news. It was just few days since release and they already published 5 hotfixes, while shouting on each corner that they are working hard for their players.\nYeah, they released a first hotfix 40 minutes after release. Second hotfix several hours later.

And yes, I know it's actually called Pixe PiraCY, but Pixel PiraTES just sounds way better.\n\nAnyway, moving on... I like this game. I really really do. HOWEVER, I cannot POSSIBLY recommend it to ANYONE, simply because of the atrociously poor productivity of the so-called "developers" of the game. They CLAIM that their complete radio silence and lack of updates for over eight months was due to ONE guy's failing health, and while I do wish him a speedy recovery, THIS DOES NOT MEAN THE REST OF YOU LOT GET TO SIT AROUND AND TWIDDLE YOUR FÛCKING THUMBS!\n\nThe game has an absolutely horrendous amount of bugs, glitches and exploits (one of the most jarring being the one with stacks of cannon balls being able to chain-explode through walls) as well as some lesser issue, such as the COMPLETELY arbitrary removal of being able to move the camera vertically (WHAT THE FÛCK?! Do you "devs" even know how hard it is to have proper sails on a decently sized frigate when you can't even have more than 2 floors?!)\n\nAnd that's not even mentioning the absolutely RETÄRDEDLY extremely poor balance issues! Here's a tip for all of you when starting a new game: PICK THE BLOODY SWORD. It's no fûckin' jokes 10x better than every single other non-epic weapon at the beginning of the game, and when it comes to a choice between an extremely retärdedly small amount of gold (20g, wow, that's ONE WHOLE BOTTLE OF RUM, YOU GUYS!!!) and an extra pirate who, frankly, is only useful for a novelty/gag achievement, it's pretty self-evident why you should choose the sword.\n\nNow, the graphics, sound and music are all nice and charming, so I won't criticize any of that. But the VOICES, however, are NOT charming AT ALL. This is a game where instead of having a few voice packs (let's say 10 per male/female) with several lines of dialogue each, you instead have maybe 200 voice packs in total, but they all contain one AND PRECISELY ONE line of dialogue! Sometimes, it's not even dialogue. Hell, I usually let my main pirate get the "Arrr!" voice, simply because it's the least grating one.\n\nSeriously. This voice thing wouldn't be so horrible if it wasn't for the fact that the one single line they have is ALL they EVER say, and BY GOD do they say it a fûcking LOT. Every time you give them an order, every time they "say" one of the idle remarks (which, admittedly, can be entertaining in a random joke sorta way) that appears as texts above them, and sometimes for no reason at all. So yeah. Voices? God it's horrible... even worse was the fact that the lady-types only got to say "Loser!" for a REALLY long while, which made playing as or even WITH a female pirate, especially SEVERAL such pirates, an absolutely NIGHTMARISH experience.\n\nNow, a cappella pirating voices aside, the game does have some fun factors too, like the extremely easy way to build your own ship (vertical camera restrictions notwithstanding) and how many different types of weapons there are to collect and use. Granted, you're not gonna see a handheld swivel-cannon type gun or a fist-claws type melee weapon, or even more outlandish things such as pots 'n' pans being wielded, but aside from that, the variety and actual differences between various weapons does lend the game some much-needed longevity.\n\nAnd the fact that you can have a good-sized crew rather than the measly maximum amount of 8 blokes in FTL, for example, means you don't need to feel entirely devastated and irredeemably crippled if 1-2 pirates die later on, since you can have at least 64 of the nasty, perpetually pooping fûckers at a time. So that's good.\n\nAll in all, I like the game, but I'm DEFINITELY not blind to its imperfections. More likely, I've been made aware of the game's various blights way too well at this point. When/if the developers pull their heads outta their Horke-ärses, then MAYBE I'll change/remove this verdict and give them a more favourable judging, but until then, I would recommend everyone to STEER CLEAR of this game. 6.1/10","May 8","false","86.3"," 224 of 297 people (75%) found this review helpful 55 people found this review funny","75","224","297","55","8"

If it's a town, you get off and sell your loot and maybe buy some food. All stores in all towns of the same rank sell the same items, so you'll stop looking at the store's inventories very quickly.\nOn Islands, you will watch as your crew automatically fights some enemies, then open one treasure chest which always contains some gold and a few grindstones. You could also trigger one random location that either spawns some more enemies or gives you some useless items.\nAgainst pirate ships, you just wait for the enemy to board your ship (or board theirs if they don't do it), watch as your crew automatically fights them and then click the "plunder" button to get some gold and ship parts.\n\nThat's the entire game.\n\nRandom issues I have encountered:\n- Some UI functions simply do nothing if certain preconditions aren't fulfilled, so you never know if the game glitched out or you did something wrong.\n- Crew members simply refuse to leave the ship after a few minutes of playing, making it impossible to board enemy ships or islands until you save and reload the game.\n- The minute counter of the play timer doesn't revert at 60 minutes, so it showed my play time as 04:273:18 after four hours and 33 minutes of playing.\n- The script is full of typos, grammatical errors and horrible dialogue based on internet memes ("Do you even Arrr?").\n- The game does not have permadeath, despite what the store page may tell you. Losses won't make you tear your hair out; they'll simply make you reload your last autosave.\n- Even if you turn autosaves off the game will still autosave when you exit.\n- To use items, you have to pretend that they're an accesory that you want to equip. The help screen doesn't explain this.\n- Also, healing items don't get stronger, so when your crew members each have 500+ HP you'll still be stuck with items that restore 5-30 HP. This will eventually make the game unplayable as nearly every enemy will explode on death and deal massive AoE damage to your characters which you cannot adequately heal.\n\nI admit that I still had some fun with Pixel Piracy and that it has some addictive qualities. However, the price is absolutely ridiculous considering that you can pick up games like Transistor or Trails in the Sky for a similar amount of money.","August 4, 2014","false","10.9"," 249 of 354 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","249","354","0","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/juliegero/recommended/264140/","juliegero","Gero","http://steamcommunity.com/id/juliegero/","342 products in account","Pros:\n- It's kind of fun. I felt the need to finish the game, which is more than what I can say for most games. Took 12 hours to beat going at a slow pace.\n- You can build your own ship.\n- You get to watch your crew kick poop off your ship for half the game.\n\nCons:\n- Horrendously loud intro. Turn your volume down when you start the game.\n- Repetitive voice audio. These pirates talk a lot and they sound prepubescent.\n- Redundant game play. If you've seen one ship/island battle, you've seen them all. Towns look mostly the same with some variation of available shops. You go back and forth between ship/island battles and town where you unload your booty and restock on inventory.\n-  Increasing frame rate lag  as you progress. By the time I beat the game, I was down to about 5 fps. It was especially bad when it was raining.\n- Tedious menus. Not getting into this one since it's difficult to describe. It was probably the worst part of the game.\n- Game difficulty. Getting dodge to 200% and splitting your remaining points into vitality and strength make the game  trivial. None of my crew were in danger when fighting the final legendary pirate. He ate bullets and flopped over before reaching anyone.\n- Unimpressive food, skill, pet, and morale system:\n\nThe crew gets hungry and unhappy over time. Just leave food out on your ship and your crew will eat when they feel like it. For some reason, you can't place food on the ship unless you're docked at a town, so your crew gets to starve for a bit when you take over an enemy ship. There are a dozen different foods to purchase, but I found myself buying nothing but citrus and fruit due to issues with scurvy. Scurvy reduces your crew's attributes, which are vital to winning battles, until you consume food that contains vitamins. I felt no compelling reason to buy any other type of food. Whenever the crew were unhappy, I either gave them rum or paid them an inconsequential amount of money. Essentially just an extra button to press every 5 minutes.\n\nSkills can be acquired through books you find in item stores or pillaging ships/islands. There is a limit to how many skills you can have, so you have to choose which to keep for each crewmember. The only non-combat skills necessary to play the game are cleaning, ship repair, and swimming.\n\nYou can catch pets using an animal cage. I captured about 20 animals and all they did was add to the amount of poop my crew had to clean. In the rare event that enemies boarded my ship, the animals would assist in defending, but that was it. You can mount an animal on yourself for an added benefit such as increased movement speed, but I didn't bother since I found myself accidently picking up a crewmember instead of the pet every time.\n\nConclusion:\nIt's an okay game to snag on sale if you enjoy rogue-like games, but I do not recommend it at full price.\n","August 23, 2015","true","12.3"," 102 of 132 people (77%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","77","102","132","14","2"

You'd be surprised by the number of people who have less hours on games and make extremely valid points.\n\n"The game is still in Early Access, Way to be helpful."\nWell aware of that. I see a pretty bright future for the game.\n\n"Welcome to the world of Roguelikes/Roguelites."\nSorry, did you check to see what games are in my library?\n\n"Whine whine whine whine whine and whine."\nErm, was that really needed?\n\n\nAlright, here we go. Here goes my rant...\n\nPixel Piracy is being published by Re-Logic, the devs behind one of my personal favorite Indie games: Terraria. Do they get cut slack because I love Terraria so much? Nope. The gameplay is a bit repetitive, even for a roguelike. I'm a big fan of roguelikes and enjoy playing them a lot. However, this one isn't that good. The exploration thing is alright, but it could've used more detail. Managing your ship is a pain in the ♥♥♥ due to being overwhelmed with food, crewmembers, poop, ship upgrades, health, and more. It overwhelms me even more than FTL does. The graphics are average at the most, and there isn't much to it. YES, I understand this is pixelated graphics, but to the people out there who lack intelligence, I DON'T LIKE THE WAY THE PIXELATED VISUALS WERE USED. There.\n\nThe audio, oh god, the dang audio. It is so ANNOYING listening to "Me hardy har!" every three seconds. Yes, I'm well aware of this thing called 'mute' and it ruins the game, too.\n\nThe game, which I do understand, as it is in Early Access, has very little content. If it were the full game, I would rate this lower, but seeing that it isn't, I won't even bother with that. However, on the bright side of this, Pixel Piracy does have a pretty good future ahead, but it wouldn't be one of the greatest roguelikes of recent memory, like Dungeons of Dredmor and FTL. Also, for an Early Access game, I discovered little to no bugs. I've played many Early Access games, and this one was probably the best running of all of them. One other thing I saw is that it does have quite the replayability, and that it is one of those games that you dislike, but you can't help but play it anyway.\n\nSo, in conclusion, I understand the game is in Early Access, but I've played better games that came out with less content, more bugs, etc etc. If you buy it and like it, then great. I'm happy for you that it was worth it. However, I would approach this game with caution. I'm afraid that I cannot recommend this game.\n\nGraphics- 5/10\nGameplay- 4/10\nStory- 5/10\nAudio- 2/10\nReplayability- 9/10\n\n.:5.0/10:.\n+Bright future\n+Runs well for Early Access\n+Lots of replayability\n-Annoying audio\n-Repetitive gameplay\n-Limited exploration\n-Far too overwhelming\n-Poorly done 8-bit graphics\n___________________________________________________________________________________\n\nEDIT: New Review in Progress as of 7/31/14\n\nSo far, based off of what I've played, it is much, much better now. The audio is much better, however the loops are very plain. The quality is much better, and the game runs great. However, the gameplay didn't change and the replayability lost it's spark. The exploration didn't change much but isn't as linear anymore. The overwhelming aspect of the game was organized much more now due to the new UI that is similar to FTL's. The devs are also very dedicated and seem to be very friendly compared to other devs out there. Kudos to them for releasing the game. And for the bright future part, looks like I was right. Most of the flaws I had with the game were fixed. Expect a positive review coming out soon.\n\nEDIT: 8/10/14\n\nAppears to be much more rushed than I thought. I encountered a few bugs and began disliking the game again. Forget what I said earlier about the positive review stuff.

I could have enjoyed it. Scratch that; I did enjoy it. To a limited extent.\nIn theory this is one of the better games I have played of its kind. Simple, somewhat repetitive and grindy, and full of numbers, just the way I like it. In practice however... It's an unpolished, crude, and messy game.\n\nControls are weird and take a bit to get used to. I eventually got the hang of it and managed to play the game rather fluidly, but I can see that not being the case for a lot of people. There's a limit to how much you learn from the tutorials, and I would never judge anyone for failing to figure out the game and giving up. (Moreso than in other games, that is).\n\nThe menus are tedious and  break, items are grouped together weirdly and I've had cases where I've had to spend several minutes burning skill books on pirates to access completely unrelated items as there is no scrolling feature in the gven subset of items. Weaponry is weirdly nondescriptive, and I have refrained from buying a lot of weapons as the listed Damage Per Second for weapons in the store is greatly misleading.\n\nThe game also suffers from, as most other reviewers mention, late game performance issues. Once my ship's size reached some fifteen by thirty blocks in size, the game froze for well over half a second every time I placed a tile. Adding twentyfive crewmembers made the entire game experience run in a rather nasty way. I've had several crashes, and loading screens become waiting games at the point in the game I reached. In short, progress is punished by performance loss.\n\nHad this game been shown a bit more love and attention, It could have become one of my more liked games. I like it as is, but it's in the way you love a dog who tries its best and is very soft, but poops on the carpet, rolls in any available mud, and conveniently has to go outside whenever you are asleep. It's debatable whether or not it's worth the effort in the end.\n\nIn short; it's a sweet little game that could have been much more enjoyable were it not seemingly a rushed and unpolished project, coding and content wise. Do not under any circumstances buy it at full price, though if you have the game sense necessary to figure out the control system and enjoy casual looting and leveling up it might be worth its price when it gets a solid cut off during some sort of sale.","January 2","false","22.8"," 48 of 55 people (87%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","87","48","55","2","0"

He seemed confused as to whether to join his crew in the tavern or practice swords in the cabin.  Or throw the turd away.  Or set the turtle down.  Yes, this is a problem, and I doubt the excuse of the crew having freewill really addresses this.  But more on this later.\n\nInitally it was a fun experience, though the lack of intuitive tutorials made it a little rockier to start than most games.  The overall look of the game, the sound of the music, and the grunts of the pirates were all quite welcoming as well.  As I conquered each island or pirate ship, things got progressively harder in a maneagable sense.  I hired my first mate and named him "Vance the Lance" in honor of the hulking spear he carried.  I got a kick out of his former job as a fantastic male model.  Qualities I definitely need in my pirate crew.\n\nWhatever the case, Vance and I soon had a larger crew to manage, and that's about when the problems started to happen.  Arnold the Brick (because he is dumb as a bag of bricks apparently), had decided he was no longer going to cook the fish he had become so good at catching.  I decided to teach another crew member how to cook expecting this to solve the problem.  Ironically, this crew member nearly died to starvation because he too refused to cook, despite having both the skill and knife to do so.  Meanwhile, Arnold kept providing me fish which I as the player kept placing in hopes of SOMEONE actually cooking it.\n\nThe solution to this odd problem was for me to dock at the nearest town and frantically buy fruit for my famished crew.\n\nNow, some would say the real problem here was that the morale must have been poor.  I wish I could say this was the problem, but I had my crew loaded with Rum and Gold, thus spirits were high.  Nope, this was just an example of poor AI.  Which brings us back to my poor first mate.\n\nPoor Vance.  I wanted to help him, but he was so absorbed in his turd/turtle ritual...it was bad.  And that wasn't the only thing I saw.  Many of my pirates couldn't handle things like "crawl over up that ladder" or "walk over there."   I was excited to get cannons, but soon I realized that the AI was very prone to getting choked on that as well.  My cannoneers would frequently take too long to load cannons.  Some would be more inclined to playing cards than loading the cannon.  Your game of solitaire needs to wait guys!  Cannons PLEASSSE!\n\nThen the fights would happen.  I liked the chaos of it all well enough, but sometimes stupid junk would happen.  Like swimming.  My captain has the swimming skill, but he never seems inclined to using it when he innevitably gets knocked into the water.  The knockback can get kinda crazy in the fights too.  Thank goodness there is a reloading button..but sheesh.\n\nThen there was sailing.  I get the use for it, but I kinda wish there were more random occurences that would just happen to break things up.  Something like, mermaid attacks...or giant white whale attacks...or seagull raiding parties...  I don't know...Just something!  Break up the humdrum of pooping pirates derping back and forth on a fictional ship.\n\nThe morale/hunger is the last thing that I think needs a bit more tweaking.  Gold is used to pay your crew, which instantly puts them at full morale.  Gold is also used to feed the crew when your sailing.  You can raise their morale and their hunger (how well fed they are) at taverns.  The hunger stat raises reaaaaally slowly, so unless you want to wait all day, your better off buying food for them at the ship (which costs even more gold), or fishing it (which means dealing with finicky AI). They also have to have gold to spend (apparently) to make use of the tavern...but with no way to track what gold each pirate has, it's kinda difficult to keep track of (i.e. When did I last pay them?).  It also bothers me immensly that my captain never seems to eat when he is at the tavern.  It seems he is damned to eating food on a ship instead of with his crew.\n\nAh well...I bought the game on sale at least, so I'm not OVERLY disgruntled.\n\nDon't get me wrong.  I've enjoyed my time with this game so far...but I think I will stop and wait for them to address some of these issues (hopefully) before I continue my foray into Pixel Piracy.\n\nI'll gladly update this review in the future if some changes actually occur!  Until then, Vance and his turd problem shall remain.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nEDIT:\n\nThought I might throw some more positives into what I thought about the game:\n\n-Combat is frantic, but I enjoyed the chaos of it.  It isn't so noticeable with small crews, but with larger crews it can be a chaotic blast.\n-Creating your own boat is an interesting concept as you progress through the game.  You always have the option of simply taking the enemy boat, but I enjoy plundering them and slowing adding various parts to my own ship.  I'd love to see more cosmetic damage to the ship as you take bombardment shots eventually!\n-Charming: I know I said it once before, but I really do like the look and sound of it all.  I'm not a fan of  all the shanties/tavern songs, but I do think that it is a nice touch.  Visually, I enjoy the pixelated nature of the characters and the locales they inhabit.\n-Looting makes me feel good, and there is always the chance you'll find something very nice (like a diamond which sells for quite a bit)  I'd love to see more of this expanded, but it seems good enough for now.  I'd love to see plundering expanded (i.e. attacking TRADE ships vs pirate, or attacking cities, or stealing the food stores off a ship)\n\nAnd lastly, the management is a positive when the game works as I think was intended.  When the AI actually does what you want, and you get into the groove of managing moral vs gold, it is fairly enjoyable.  I would tweak it in different ways personally, but I think the framework in place works well enough. (i.e. I'd make taverns more effective at curing hunger, I'd make paying the crew worth less morale to place more emphasis on buying/finding rum or visiting taverns)\n------\n1.7 Update\n\nThe Good news:\n\n-My first mate finally got his life straight and decided to join us on the shore.\n-For about 30-40 minutes, the AI felt decent/better and I was enjoying myself well enough.\n-Pets are way easier to catch now!  No more grinding!\n-My captain actually finally decided that bar food is OK.  It may have only been a nibble, but that is progress in my book.  I sincerely hope they address taverns and make them a little more useful in regards to hunger.(and on that note, I really wish I knew how much gold each crewmember had to spend!)\n\nThe Bad news:\n-After about 40 minutes, my new pet chicken (called ROBOCHICKEN) decided he is part of the crew now.  I caught him practicing with swords and playing cards in a corner.  I didn't notice if he was also eating, but I definitely caught the bugger taking a dump next to the larder.  I've got my eye on you chicken!\n-The AI has gone back to being a reluctant mess.  Shovelback Ray (my chief shovel carrier/treasure hunter) refuses to leave the boat for anything.\n-The moral system went haywire.  I paid my crew as usual, but seconds later everyone went from super happy to "KILL THE CAPTAIN" rage.  I dunno...maybe the chicken is promoting a mutiny among my men?\n\n-Eh, Better luck in 1.08 I hope!\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------","August 6, 2014","false","21.6"," 65 of 83 people (78%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","78","65","83","6","6"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ErickaUnlimited/recommended/264140/","ErickaUnlimited","💝💝ErickaUnlimited💝💝","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ErickaUnlimited/","777 products in account","Overview\nPixel Piracy is a 2D side-scrolling adventure game developed by Quadro Delta. The game puts you in the shoes of a pirate captain with a mission to defeat four legendary pirates. During your quest you'll have to recruit crew members, train them, arm them, fight rival pirates and imperial ships, loot said ships or capture them if you so desire. If that sounds like fun to you, then let the disappointment commence! Pixel Piracy is a disaster.\n\nThe game starts you off on an island, where you'll give your captain a name, change a few minor looks (face, hair, clothing color) and answer a few questions that will change a few parameters of your gameplay (more ship encounters, less encounters, more starting gold, higher loot rates...etc) and you're off and running. In the beginning you'll be tasked to hire crew members, design your ship and set sail for treasure, knowledge, death and bordem.\n\nThe map is broken up into nodes (squares). Each node holds either an island (hostile or friendly), towns of various sizes, or ship encounters (pirate or imperial vessels). A number is given before sailing to the next node that indicates the difficulty of what you'll encounter and to help you gauge what you can handle. The combat itself is nothing to write home about; it consists of boarding a ship and letting your crew kill the opposition. Typically, it's over in a matter of seconds and requires only a few mouse clicks per battle. As you fight higher difficulty crews, you'll be able to acquire ship cannons, new weapons, and passive bonuses to help your crew survive. You'll also obtain hull components that you can use to customize your ship.\n\nAlong with better equipment, you must sustain your crew's morale, and hunger levels. Morale is effected by the cleanliness of your ship and by paying your crew their salary in gold, which is typically found from plundering ships and raiding islands. The game does have permadeath for both crew and captain. You can die from drowning, being killed in action, a wild animal, starvation or mutiny (low morale). That's about all there is to the game. It seems like a lot, but it's not very in depth.\n\nWhat Pixel Piracy does right, it does a dozen more things wrong. Let's break the down game on what it did right and what it did wrong.\n\nI felt the ship building was done well. It was easy to mix and match pieces, shuffle them around and make the ship however I wanted. Where it went wrong was with mast/sail building, which is finicky at best and broken at worst. I was forced to capture a ship with a flag/sail just to get the achievement since it wouldn't let me build my own (even with all the components).\n\nEquiping and changing around your pirate's gear and bonuses is was well done. It was easy to move around them, switch out weapons and see what would serve me better than what I already had; a DPS counter was on all the weapons, which made it easy to pick through. However, the combat was dull and forgettable. Sure, I could and did deck out everyone in great gear, but watching them fight was boring; it was a cluster of pixelated people flying left and right, shooting here and stabbing there. There was nothing to do mid fight aside from tossing a few bandages for health. You were left as a spectator in your own game.\n\nSeveral aspects: two minor ones and one major, were the most off-putting during my experiences playing. The minor aspects included the voices/sound effects and the game's weird fascination with defecation and applying that to every aspect of the game: there were achievements for your crew soiling your ship, for seagulls soiling your ship, skills to lessen said soiling of said ship and so on and so forth. It was rather absurd. With that being said, the sound effects. The voices were agitating. Between the bad singing in the taverns, my crew constantly saying random, nonsensical things and my captain sounding like she was being sexually gratified every time she said "Yes!" I couldn't tell what I hated more.\n\nThe major issue was path finding. When sailing to an island, your crew will use a grapple hook to climb down towards the island. On occasion and alarmingly frequently, they would fail to grapple either to the island or back to the ship. When that happens, the crew member would walk right into the water and drown, or jump into the air and then fall back down, also in the water and also drowning. You'd lose your crew member (remember, permadeath?) and all their gear, skills and work you put into them. To remedy this, you would have to re-load, or continue on without him/her and suffer the loss. This has been an issue for some time and the developers were made aware of it, but the problem was never resolved.\n\n\nPros\nShip building - I actually liked this aspect of the game.\nEquipment - There's a decent amount of weaponry and active/passive bonuses to apply to your crew. It's easy to work with and upgrade your crew.\nCons\nAI - Path finding issues, glitches, failure to follow instructions and they never stop talking...\nPath finding - As mentioned before, your pirate will, often, fail to grapple the ship from an island fall in the water and drown. It happens. A lot. In a few hour span I lost about a dozen pirates to this and had to restart on many occasions.\nVoice acting - It's bad. Not only is it atrociously bad, it's dreadfully annoying too. After an hour or so I had to turn off the voice completely.\nCombat - It's dull. Click to have your pirates attack, wait a few seconds, collect loot. rinse, repeat indefinitely.\n\nOverall, Pixel Piracy sounds good on paper, but it fails in execution. It's heavy-handed UI and AI are both cumbersome and obnoxious. It suffers from game breaking glitches that will force you to re-load the game on several occasions, or start over completely. That is, unless you don't just quit first. Pixel Piracy needs work and a lot of it at that. I tried to find a silver lining in this game. I really did; there just is no justification for something that feels so unfinished. If you're looking for a pirate themed game, look somewhere else. Pixel Piracy isn't worth the price tag or your time.","April 14","false","5.9"," 44 of 52 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","44","52","2","3"

There are so many things wrong with it I don't even know where to start.\n\nWas it ever even tested? I've played for maybe 4-5 hours and have already found two gamebreaking bugs, and countless minor ones.\n\nThe game in general is just completely devoid of polish. Why are there social media links on the main menu? Is this a flash game? The timer would have me believe that I have sunk 2 hours and 159 minutes into my current playthrough. Why did the developers feel obliged to invent a new system of time measurement? Why is there text floating in the air on islands?\n\nThe AI is completely nonexistent. Crewmembers will run right through enemies instead of attacking them and will never attack neutral characters unless I do so with my captain. Pathing is horrible. Being given a shorter path and a longer one, crewmembers inevitably take the latter. They also sometimes get stuck on single blocks, which they should be able to climb.\nSometimes they refuse to eat and simply die of hunger. Their salary is random and the game lies as to how much pay the crew wants.\n\nThere are numerous design problems that should have been fixed before the game was released. Blocks destroyed by cannons turn into unwalkable floor, which means characters may end up stuck. Caught fish cannot be eaten until you dock and actually place them on your ship. The game is very micro-intensive. I had to switch manually between a fishing-rod and sword for one of my pirates every time I was in combat.\n\nDo not make the same mistake I did.

Now I will leave the old review bits here because I want people to see how the game has changed from the last time I played which was roughly half a year ago. I will make some comparisons though just to show what changed.\n\nSo the game. The one thing that they improved that makes this game more fun is they improved the economy. For those who don't know, in the previous versions, getting spending gold was work in itself but now enemy ships and pirates and whatever else you can think of just drops gold like they're money making machines which is fine since now you can just get stuff and build your pirate army! Arrrgh maties!\n\nAnother issue that this game had was that the enemy doesn't respawn but now they do! Though it takes a while. With this fix, another issue has appeared. Since the enemy do respawn and you're going to out-level them in a few minutes with the new economy, there's a need for enemies to scale. Sure you can just keep going outwards and outwards for the higher level enemies but I just spent about an hour into the game and I'm already butting heads with Lv7 enemies with a giant ship and a crew of 10+ mates and then the entire area is void of enemies waiting to respawn. Cleared out the Lv5-6 and since the Lv7s are dead, it's time for Lv8s. Too fast paced.\n\nThe sea now feels more... lively. Each time you set out, there may be a weather change like rain, hurricane, fog, etc. Which brings up another problem, the music. I'm in a hurricane and yet the music in the background is soothing and it's like telling my crew to go to sleep and all the problems will go away. Then another problem with the sounds is that they're broken. What I mean is that during in a fight, I can have my camera on the scene yet all I would hear is the music and seagulls with the occasional sword clash and/or scream from dying enemies. I mean this is more of a bug than anything but I just felt like putting it out there since I was talking about background music anyways.\n\nThere are a lot more variety of things for your ship to pretty it up. Speaking of ships, back then when you capture a ship, you get the ship exactly the way it's look. What I mean is that when you're in a battle, the enemy ship is orientated in such a way that it is pointing at you and when you capture it, it stays that way. Now when you do capture a new ship, the ship is re-orientated to point the proper way. Nice attention to detail.\n\nI get the feel this is less of a review and more about a changelog or something. The game is certainly more satisfying to play but it still is lacking a certain niche. Don't get me wrong, it is fun to make a ship with a ton of cannons and just shoot the heck out of my opponent not giving a rat's ♥♥♥ about money anymore but that just tends to get boring especially since I have to go out and look for fights to deal with and then head back to buy more ammo in case I run out. Now... Is this game worth the price... Still no. It's getting close though, it really is but still not feeling it.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[Old Review] I want to recommend this game. I really do but at the game's current stage, I cannot. When I first checked that it was created by creators of Terraria, I thought to myself, "Hey, here's a nice lay-back game I could play. The creators should know how to make worlds in this game."\n\nThen I get smacked in the face like just 3-4 hours into the game. The world does seem large and vast with variety in it, AT FIRST. Then after a while, the flaws of the game becomes so glaringly sharp that it just feels dull.\n\nI haven't been to Lv6 or above island/pirate ships yet but except for your possible starting weapon, the Falcon Blade, there are absolutely no unique weapons. Even the Falcon Blade falls short after getting a crew of 5 combat-able pirates. After that it's just a plain Zerg rush onto enemy ships or hostile islands and wiping the populace from the face of the Earth. I guess if you want just a generic army with nothing truly special about them, this works. I wanted to feel special though.\n\nEnemy pirate ships are not RNG encounters. They are actually listed on the map for you to go to beat up. After that, they're gone completely. So while you're traveling from point A to point B, you're sitting there looking at the screen for 1-2 minutes while playing games on your iPhone because literally nothing ever happens. In the beginning of the game, there were a rare instance of a Fishman jumping onto my ship and I had to kill it off but that never happens once you upgrade your ship to a larger one. All you will ever see on screen are your pirates pooping all over the deck, fishing for food, eating, text bubbles going so fast that you can barely read what they say and it's just plain BORING.\n\nThe chests in this game are absolutely disappointing. Except for the buried chests, the chests you find on islands and enemy ships yield about 3-10g depending on how many pirates have the 'More Gold in Chests' skill and their levels. Item loots are about 90% of the time grindstones to increase your melee weapons' damage. There are grindstones for ranged but you can only buy those. I would expect an enemy galleon to have way more than 10g and 2 grindstones in their stupid treasury box.\n\nGame looks nice. Feels nice. Doesn't follow through. $10? Well I paid $7.50 since I had a coupon but... I've had $1 iPhone games that I've played for 20 hours so... You doods should wait.","November 19, 2014","false","9.7"," 233 of 371 people (63%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","63","233","371","9","9"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/asdfasdfgfd/recommended/264140/","asdfasdfgfd","The Durstertaker","http://steamcommunity.com/id/asdfasdfgfd/","405 products in account","Lots of potential here, unfortunately spread a little thin and made near enough unplayable by bugs.\n\nI dare say Pixel Piracy in its current state is more broken than it was when I first played it a few months ago, before the devs claimed it was "complete."  Members of your crew will frequently decide not to follow your orders - this is not a result of the game's morale mechanic, which makes low morale crew members refuse orders, this happens with happy as can be, 100% morale pirates. Sometimes, they'll stand in one place and not listen to anything you say, or even move of their own accord(in order to say, get food, clean or repair the ship). Other times they'll quite happily go wherever you tell them on the ship, but can't grapple onto other ships or an island. In a game where most of the gameplay revolves around commanding your crew, you can see why this is extremely frustrating.\n\nSo the game has bugs, those can be fixed, and I trust the devs not to ignore such a glaring issue. What about gameplay? It's... Okay. When I played the early access, I thought it was pretty fun, but it didn't take long before it started to get boring and samey. Now the finished game is out and I find myself thinking more or less the same things. The combat consists of rounding up all your dudes and sending them in the direction of the enemy who is rounding up all his dudes and sending them at you, you meet in the middle and hopefully win. The outcome of a fight is decided by stats and equipment, which is true of a lot of games, but unfortunately there's not a lot of depth or variety to those aspects either. If you win a fight you get some gold, some experience and some (usually uninteresting) loot.\n\nThe biggest curveball the combat has to offer is the knockback mechanic, which is far too big a curveball. Even on "easy" knockback settings(knockback reduced to 40%) my dudes were getting knocked back several feet. You don't get enough control over your pirates to do much to avoid it, it doesn't really add anything to the game aside from occasionally instantly killing someone if they get knocked into the ocean. Most of your game overs will be a result of this happening to your captain, and to top it off, if you kill an enemy this way, you can't get the loot they drop. The game's morale system feels a little underdeveloped as well. It's pretty much what it sounds like: if you don't keep your dudes happy they're less willing to fight and if morale gets too low they'll turn on you. There are two main ways to restore your crew's morale: Pay their salary(costs money, obviously) or let them spend some time at a tavern, which is free but taverns are few and far between and you never know if a town has one until you actually dock there. This discourages exploration and makes it advantageous to stay as close to known taverns as you can.\n\nMost of your gold will pay for food and your crew's salaries, the rest you will save up to hire more crewmemebers until you have a big enough crew to take on tougher battles to get more gold, which you'll need because your crew is eating more food. Lather, rinse, repeat. There's variety in the enemies, but only superficially. Mostly, you'll be fighting pirates. Sometimes, you'll be fighting vikings, skeletons, hobos or chinese. Yeah, there's an entire enemy class just called "Chinese." You get slightly different loot from them, but aside from that the only differences are visual, which is hard to pick out given the low detail of the sprites and the visually chaotic combat. It still boils down to throwing all your dudes at them and hoping you come out on top.\n\nSo the combat is alright at best, but that's not even what you'll be spending most of your time doing. Most of the time, you'll be sailing between locations. While sailing, you don't really do anything. You watch your crew eat and poop, and listen to them chatter. Occasionally, they'll sing a sea shanty, which isn't very good but if anything it's a welcome release from repeating the same quips ad nauseam. Nothing happens, your ship just sails along a flat, lifeless ocean for a while until you reach your destination. This gets more annoying later in the game as you start travelling further distances at a time. You can sail faster by gluing bits to your boat or with character skills, but spending valuable cash and skill points to reduce tedium doesn't strike me as good game design. You have to go through this every time you move to a different location, which includes heading back to town to buy food and let your crew rest, so half the time you don't even have anything interesting to look forward to. The excessive waiting is what really kills the fun of this game.\n\nAll these flaws are a shame because underneath it all there's a fun game that really wants to show itself. Though it doesn't require a lot of thought, managing your crew and gradually building it up to take on tougher fights is satisfying. The music, voices and graphics are all nice, but lack in quantity and get repetitive. It feels like a beta version: a solid foundation, lacking balance and content and with a bunch of bugs that need cleaning up. If the devs continue working on it I still think something good can come out of Pixel Piracy. Unless that happens, don't bother with this.\n\n"JOLLY ROGER! JOLLY ROGER! JOLLY ROGER! JOLLY ROGER!

Heard a lot of good things about this game. I'm guessing it got worse as time went on?\n\nThe game feels more like early access or beta test version, and only couple hours into playing I encountered a "two captains" bug which forced me to kill my best crew member. Aside from crew randomly failing to get on board the ship correctly and plunging into their deaths - which apparently is part of the game design -, I encountered random mutiny bug late game when I got about 18 crew members, and had to resort to constantly loading/saving the game which was extremely frustrating that I finally gave up.\n\nMore about the bugs:\n\nTwo captains bug - it happens when you load/restart the day in the midst of battle; your "first mate" becomes the new capptain, while the old captain is still alive. You effectively have two guys with [C] on top of their heads, and the bottomleft side health/hunger/morale HUD constantly flickers between the old and the new captains. I tried looking into editing the xml savefile to no avail. The only way out was to kill one of them.\n\nRandom mutily bug - Someone in the crew keep mutinying randomly even though morale/hunger gage are full and I constantly pay their salaries every two minutes. It started happening after I hired bunch of new guys to train as ♥♥♥♥ removers while I train my older crew to man the guns, and it's extremely frustrating because the one who mutiny is chosen completely at random including my old crew whom I've invested in significantly. It happens while sailing, while onboard enemy ship, while on land/town/tavern you name it. Again I tried virtually everything including teaching everyone to clean and poop less, increasing the ship size to almost twice the screen width, installing sword stations to keep them busy and separated, etc.. - oh and of course paying them every two minutes and stocking ♥♥♥♥ load of rum and food. At first I suspected a sudden and synchronized pooping of 20 pirates caused flash crash in morale, so I taught every one of them to clean and poop properly; no not it. I installed 5 pictures and 3 plants and separated them into groups of 6~7 across the ship; no not that either. I even went into xml file and changed crew traits that are potentially negative such as 'liar', 'greedy', etc., and increased friendship points; still happens. We take down Lv.8 pirate ship and the captain is busy running around enemy ship looting chests and urns, and one of my oldest and best guy (lv 40) decides to "go bad" in the middle of 18 other guys and kills himself instantly.\n\nFew other bugs/quirks that are worth mentioning:\n- Ransom kills do not increase "renown" points. It says it does in the game, but in the savefile it is stuck at 0.\n- Stations that increase pirate stats, such as swords, books(?), and grinding wheels are almost unusable because they are like pirate magnets; all my fishermen guys are busy sweating with swordplay and end up starving the crew.\n- Cannot place cannonballs at sea and must dock to place them. why?? also since when cannonballs are called "bombs"? Never would've figured that out on my own.\n- When you try to move few pirates at once, one or two always ends up not getting the order and stay behind.\n- Teaching swimming is a must since when you move a large group of guys(~10+), one or two will always end up slipping and falling into the sea; and this is without "careless" trait, mind you.\n- Other minor interface glitches: After selling the same items a few time (such as wooden block) sound is gone. You feel like something is broken but it's not. When you close shipbuilding interface while placing a block, block info HUD remains on the screen. Come on guys, these are pretty basic stuff.\n\nAll in all it was pretty interesting game; with great potential. I really enjoyed the game otherwise I wouldn't have played it over ten hours and tried so hard to "fix" it somehow. However the game has some very serious shortcomings, such as unfriendly and glitchy user interface, broken game mechanics, and some serious bugs that could completely ruin your experience. For that I'd give it 4 out of 10. I personally believe this cannot be a production version, v1.0+. If it were early access/dev beta I would've understood, but this isnt. Lastly, from now on I'll ignore any "official" reviews that gave this buggy software 10/10 and go straight to reading customer reviews first. "Mostly positive"..

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dreigear/recommended/264140/","dreigear","Dreiszen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dreigear/","79 products in account","To get this out of the way in advance- I don't know how I spent 20+ hours on this game. I took a lot of time trying to justify this purchase and find something good in this game but I instead burned out fast. Also I left it running in the background while I did other stuff, but we'll get to that later.\n\nApparently, this game has gotten a little better than when it launched, as it's at least a stable, running program that does what it's meant to with some degree of consistency. This has had the unfortunate side effect of revealing it to be a poorly designed and thought out game on several other levels. A lot of things in this game, from the stock Unity pregame config menu to the bizarre use of the English language, lead me to believe that this is less a project someone worked on because they wanted to and more a product hastily thrown together for commercial release.\n\nCharacter creation is arguably worse than nonexistant. There is a character creator at game start, but you just shuffle through random selections until you find the one you want. This is made a little easier by how limited the selections are, and also how little they matter, as you'll see little of your own character in this game. You have direct control of where the Captain goes and who they attack and that's about it. You need the captain nearby to open chests and dig holes but they're otherwise a regular crewmember. If your Captain dies, they're unceremoniously replaced by another nearby crewmember. You might not even realize it happened, and realistically, even if you do it won't notice unless you were particularly attached to your starting character.\n\nThe central idea is that you build a ship and sail around, destroying other ships, looting and generally doing pirate-y things. There are towns, islands and other ships scattered around the world, and as you sail further towards the edges of the world, enemy encounters increase in difficulty. The problem is that this "difficulty" is entirely contrived. Enemies get bigger ships and more crew members for the first few levels, but around rank 5 the ships start to get samey. Coincidentally, this is the rank at which cannon combat becomes a major factor, necessitating a 30-second wait before boarding can begin. The fact that you can't control your gunners' targets and that their AI occasionally locks up for the entire phase doesn't help. Eventually all that increases is the level of the enemies you fight, and by that I mean their HP- and, more troubling, their tendency to know a skill that causes them to violently detonate on death. Otherwise they're not much of a threat- a team of four with decent stats and good weapon experience can handle most ships in the game with no meaningful injuries.\n\nIn combat, you have almost no control. You can try to direct your captain and crew to attack specific enemies, but they seem to just do as they please, usually aggroing onto enemies that attack them. Since ranged weapons can hit through walls, this means they get juggled between targets a lot and spend much of a boarding operation pathfinding up and down ladders. Trying to watch what's actually happening is meaningless, because the already tiny characters will bunch onto the exact same location. It's actually easier to just watch the equally tiny readout at the bottom of the screen to see if any of your crew has died, and wait for the sound that indicates that all the enemies are dead.\n\nThere's also islands, and that's about all I can say about that. They have enemies on them and items you can activate. There is one that can be exploited to gain a ton of TP over and over, but for the most part the gains are miniscule. Having to kill thirty natives just to get to two coconuts and a chest with 15 gold in it is less than busy work. A few interesting things are set to happen on islands, but few actually do because of how badly optimized the game is. Far too many times I fought an islander, reduced them to near-death and saw the screen go dark with the prompt for them to surrender and join your crew, only for them to die because the prompt took ten seconds or more to appear. Islands also have treasure that you can dig up with a shovel that costs more than several cannons. Most of these treasures are garbage, but using treasure maps you can dig up some interesting equipment, and in attempting to use it you'll have to do battle with the game's interface.\n\nSo much of the game is reliant on your pirates, so the menu for equipping and leveling them shouldn't be so much of a mess. All pirates are sorted manually into groups that determine how they're used- the player can never select individual pirates other than the Captain, only entire groups at once. Your crew also never use their skills naturally, as their AI is entirely determined by what group you put them in. This almost entirely means that Ship Crew is the only useful group, as they prepare food and clean ♥♥♥♥ off the decks, which is 90% of sailing really- the Training, Gunnery and Boarder groups are only useful if you have a handful of specific items placed on your ship, and presumably Custom 1 (of one) just idles until they get hungry or given a kill order. The problem is that these groups can only be changed by going into the crew management menu, which is a hot mess to say the least. The biggest problem by far is that after selecting a crew member, the only way to go back to the list of crew is to close and reopen the menu. There's no way to sort your crew at all, and the game's internal sorting seems arbitrary- your captain will often end up somewhere in the middle of the top row, even if they're consistently the highest leveled among your crew. This same menu is also how your crew uses items, and between the battle interface being literally unreadable and the menu being difficult to navigate, healing mid-fight is an impossible task.\n\nSo much of this game seems to have been added in because it was a popular game mechanic and not because it was actually considered in terms of meshing with the game. You can "plunder" towns by killing NPCs, but shopkeepers have normal pirate drops, so you're really just locking yourself out. Ships take damage from cannon fire, but enemy crews will just board you well before you deal enough damage, and when they're all dead you can blow the ship up automatically anyway, so really the damage to ships only affects the player ship. There are many different island types and a lot of rare encounters you can find, but they all boil down to "bump weapons with enemy until death".\n\nBy far, what sealed this for me- not just "this game is bad" but "I need to tell people this game is bad" is that this is all there is. The objective of the game is to defeat the four legendary pirates. They are placed at the corners of a square world, surrounded by rank 9 encounters. Sailing in this game is tedious- the game loads an empty encounter, adds a percentage to the top corner of the screen and makes you wait while it counts up to 100. Nothing happens while you sail but eating and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Events take place in between this, not during. Everything between point A and B is skipped. Enemy ships can interrupt your travel, but there's no pursuit or retreat, just an optional 60% chance to attempt to evade before you're stopped dead and forced to fight. You do this until you reach the corner and meet the game's final bosses- ships at about level 4, with the exception of a single pirate with 600+ HP. They die the same as any other enemy, and you're left in the far corner of the world with the knowledge that you have to do this all three more times.\n\nNormally people say this kind of thing with hyperbole, but I entirely and earnestly mean it when I say that this game has caused deep levels of personal regret through my time with it. Looking for improvement made a passable game seem dry and tedious instead. If it were free, I would still not recommend it.","May 4, 2015","false","21.0"," 28 of 39 people (72%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","72","28","39","2","0"

Oh and fight other pirates in navel warfare... Sounds cool right?\n\nExcept when you tell your crew to go board the enemy ship and, with their captain mercilessly slaughtering enemies in front of them and the expansive blue, shark infested sea behind them... They choose the latter.\n\nAnd that's it, they're gone from the game.\n\nTaking with them the initial hiring cost, however much food they've helped themselves to, items you've used on them to cultivate them into the perfect ship mate you've always wanted...\n\nAll because the game makes them walk left instead of right.\n\nAnd this was a consistent issue, which meant I couldn't progress that far into the game because I was constantly spending all my gold replenishing my ranks.\n\nI bought it cheap in a sale, so maybe I shouldn't complain too much. But as bad as other games I've played are, they at least haven't decided to just randomly remove the results of my labours because the AI can't work out what to do.\n\nBut there's a lot of other little issues that as a collective really just suck all the fun out of playing.\n\nQuite often after issuing an order to a "group", some will decide that obeying their captain isn't in their best interests. Then I didn't mind them drowning so much.\n\nWhen you select somewhere to go on the map, you're treated to a "traveling" transition... Where you just watch the ship sail while a percentage counter slowly increases. Sometimes your crew sing a shanty. I have no idea at all why this is in the game other than to pad it out.\n\nRewards from chests were usually around 10g... After returning to the ship I was blowing up the enemy ship for 100g. The rewards are just garbage.\n\nFrom what I've seen of it the actual gameplay loop gets old pretty quick; go fight pirate ships, go explore tiny islands, go back to town for supplies, repeat. The game gives very little incentive (at least short term, as I've said I've not really been *able* to play long term) to actually play.\n\nThe menus are unpleasant to look at, I'm fine with the pixel art aesthetic, but the menus are just really unintuitive and take way longer to navigate than they need to. I couldn't even find my items for the longest time.\n\nI have no idea how they managed it, but the framerate would regularly slow to a crawl in towns.\n\nI like the idea, but I hate playing the game.\n\nThis is even playing the "enhanced" edition.","February 27, 2015","false","6.6"," 27 of 40 people (68%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","68","27","40","2","0"

Here is the full list of bugs I've personally encountered:\n\n- Cleaning crew idling instead of cleaning poo\n- Fishing crew just spamming the hell out of the fishing rod instead of just waiting for a fish\n- Trained cannon operators won't shoot. 5 cannons on the deck, all have cannon windows and plenty of ammo > they just refuse to shoot.\n- Crew eather not leaving your ship to raid the enemy one or refusing to leave the enemy ship once you're done with it. This results not being able to plunder ships without sinking your crew early on (when not everybody have swimming perk)\n- Not being able to edit ship at all (even when docked). Trying to remove or place anything on the ship literally does nothing.\n- Not everyone eats at tavern. It eather happens randomly or not happening at all. Was pretty tough to keep the crew fed after our fisherman got killed.\n- If you left click on an enemy during the preparation phase when encountering enemy ship (30 second period before you are allowed to board), your captain will board their ship and start fighting completely ignoring the boarding timer.\n- When you try to learn Sniper Shot perk, it will be equpped as passive for some reason, therefore rendering it useless.\n- Sometimes you can't scroll the list of your weapons then selling them to the arms dealer. Same thing applies when you are trying to scroll weapons in your inventory.\n- Morale icon disappearing above some of the crew members\n- Crew singing happens very rarely. I think it is suposed to be somewhat of a morale booster but crew sings like once a couple of real life hours.\n\nWell, that's about all the major bugs I encountered.\n\nFor an Early Access the game was okay. But for a full game release it just has too much bugs and especially AI glitches. If you are fine with these gameplay flaws, I'd surely recommend this game, other than that - wait for them to fix at least half of the current issues.\n\nP.s I will be updating the list overtime.\n\n*was edited due to "lazy review no research" comments","August 1, 2014","false","12.4"," 74 of 126 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","74","126","0","10"

Pixel Piracy is nowhere near finished. It's startlingly low on content, depth, and polish. It has a well thought out conept, and it has the solid groundwork of an enjoyable and well-executed game, but that's it. The result is a semi-enjoyable, yet extremely repetitive and frustrating, prototype of a game.\n\nThe actual game is a strange but creative mixture of FTL and Dwarf Fortress, as you manage the various needs of a group, which you need if you want any hope of survival, namely health, hunger, and moral. You do this by managing them in combat, feeding them, paying them or supplying drinks. They level, you teach them important skills, and spec out their stats. The macro management is relatively fun, as you choose to teach what to your various crew. Do you want to invest in teaching one guy fishing, cooking, and cleaning, or are you too worried that he'll die too easily in some wayward skirmish, or would you rather not overburden one super-crew member and rather disperse the work? Having a large crew is nice, but also expensive, in gold and in food. This form of management and gameplay, along with watching your ship grow to be larger and larger and more functional as you personally design it, is the meat and potatoes of Pixel Piracy, and they are enjoyable and well done. The base game is there, and it's good. The graphics and audio are also charming and polished. The problem, however, is virtually everything else.\n\nPixel Piracy suffers from four primary issues. First let's just talk UI and general control. It's terrible. Shockingly so. Controlling your bundle of haphazard pirates is an absolute pain, and the AI is attrociously bad. There seems to be no rhyme of reason to how your crew wobbles about, as you cannot seem to get them to prioritize and enemy and move in one motion. They need to be heavily baby-sitted through every single command and action, and if you cannot coordinate this collection of bumbling idiots, one of them will die. Very rarely do you feel responsible for any of the deaths, either you have not the slightest clue of what's going on, or the AI just decided that it doesn't want to play along. The fact that it takes about three or four clicks to get the entire crew and their captain to prioritize a certain enemy is just downright idiotic, I'm honestly confused how Re-Logic messed this up as bad as it is, and the simplest aspects of the game and genre, no less. I applaud them for trying to break the mold, but they have to do so with some confidence that it's bareable, which the controls of the game are just simply not. You eventually get used to it, but it's still an infuriatingly awkward design, to describe it briefly and crudely, it's like someone tried to combine elements of 2D point-and-click adventure games with typical top-down RTS games, and no, it did not work out. Oh, and don't even get me started on the map movement and menu setup, it's just as frustrating. You learn through experience not to use the menu or customize your ship while your captain's in a shop.\n\nThe second issue is how the game adapts to the rogue-lite genre. First of all, there are three modes, normal mode, hardcore mode, and for some reason an arena mode, which showcases by far the weakest aspect of the game --the combat, which I have already explained-- in a typical horde-like fashion. The normal mode gives you the option to save before every movement on the world map, which basically removes any weight from any mistake you make, unless it's a macro mistake. You can die as much as you like and just reload, no problem. No decision carries any importance. Okay, you may think, then just play on hardcore, which has no save feature. There in lies the rub. Due to all of my previously stated greivances about the controls and AI, combined with the game's incredibly random and confusing nature, it's near impossible to play the game feelings as if it's anymore than the roll of the dice. All the time, some tiny detail with go wrong, and literally everything will be ruined. A good rogue-lite/like will wear you down, kill you over a serious of misfortunate events, will make you pay for many little mistakes building up. In Pixel Piracy, the AI just messes up once and everything's over. Just once, the rest of your crew just decides not to follow their captain into battle regardless of their given orders, and next thing you know the game's over. Not to mention that the game has certain checkpoints, namely surviving until you get a sustainable three-person crew with cleaning and cooking abilities and when you intergrate cannons into your combate, that so suddenly kills you that it feels like your efforts meaning nothing in the palm of the RNG gods. Especially during cannon fights, which lack any option of escape after commitment, you can die so quickly and easily it makes everything seem pointless.\n\nThe third issue is just pure lack of polish. The game is incredibly repetitive, and it's buggy. Pirates falling through blocks, feces hovering inobtainable in the air, a cook who apparently just forgot how to cook, so on and so forth. And the entire game is just the identical "throw all your crew at once at the enemies' face and see how has the larger numbers" over and over and over, with only slight various in enemy type. Except when you get cannons, then it's just resource management mixed with spamming and RNG. Oh, and there's like two events, both just boring text across a blank open sea, which boils down to extra XP or paying gold instead of fighting an uncooperative swabbie. It's mind numbingly dull, just busy work in order to get resources to manage. The game desperately needs more meat on the bone.\n\nThe last issue is just the general confusion and unnecessary learning curve. It's not a matter of discovery of cryptic items and attributes like Binding of Isaac or Dungeons of Dredmor, it's a matter of just figuring out how to play the game. Learning the backwards idiosyncrasies of the AI, or how to cook food, or how to just manage your crew, is not fun, but frustrating. There is no direction, and almost everything is head-scratchingly unintuitive. This is the early action problem, the core aspects of the game, aspects it desperately needs to be enjoyable, are just not there yet.\n\nMy suggestion, wait on it. The game is currently not worth $15 in the slightest. Maybe it's worth the grind if it's half off or less, but even then, I would suggest waiting. I expect this game to get a lot better, as Re-Logic has proven itself to be a good developer, but right now, it's just not in an enjoyable state, not even truly in a playable one. I would suggest against impulse buying Pixel Piracy, in it's current state, it's just not worth it. Wait a few months, watch its development if you're interested. When the game fixes it's AI and UI issues, and more seriously designs it's the meta of the game and genre, I could see it being fantastic. Until then, put it back in the oven.","June 22, 2014","false","2.9"," 22 of 32 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","22","32","0","0"

Also keeping in mind that the game is already released "Release Date: 23 Apr, 2015". If the price of the game was lower then it's definitely worth the hours you spend on it though.\n\nAlso I'd like to say that if it had multiplayer then it would take the game to another level of fun.

The game has high and low points so to start off I shall give the low points of the game.\n\n1.\nThe beginning. Honestly I just found the beginning boring i wanted something a bit more exciting than just appearing at the menu.\n\n2.\nThe directions. After I made my character I was so confused on what to do next. I looked at the help section but it didn't help much. So honestly I dont think it was implemented well.\n\n\nNow for the good things in the game.\n\n1.  The freedom.\nI enjoyed the fact that the game doesn't hold your hand. You have to learn how to do things. Its doesn't explicitly tell you. The fact that you only have one objective and that is to beat 4 major pirates gives the player something to work towards while exploring and pilaging like a pirate. I didnt have to go talk to npc's to unlock new areas I could go wherever I wanted. But bear in mind that even though you can go anywhere  you should be cautious. You run the risk of sailing into an enemy that could wipe you out in an instant.\n\n2. Creation.\nI loved the ship creation the most, you can make what you want and it is awesome. I also love that you have the option of capturing a ship if you kill the crew.\n\n3.\nStats and leveling up.\nThe leveling up in the game is fun and how you get skills is cool. Also the fact that your pirate can have alot of different skills. Leveling up feels good cause the stats influence gameplay heavily. For example if you upgrade strength alot your character will be a tank that can kill enemies easily,or if you increase vitality you can last longer in a battle. It is small things like this that make it enjoyable.\n\nAll in all this game is not for everyone.\n\nHowever if you are willing to put in a good amount of hours into it you will be satisfied with what you achieve. Especially if you like leveling up games.\n\nI rate this a 7/10","November 7, 2014","true","23.5"," 131 of 234 people (56%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","56","131","234","10","3"

Pirates will get stuck and fall in water (they can't swim and die), They won't be able to get off your ship unless you stick to only a really simple design, and they'll go into battle solo when you didn't even tell them to attack that target.\n\nSecondly, things are just too expensive without enough payout. I was generally hanging on by a thread because the risk / reward is so narrow that it would cost me a lot of resources to make just a little money.\n\nThe control over the pirates, and just the whole game in general seems very clunky.\n\nI really wanted to like this game because I enjoy pirate type games but I just can't until they get these few things straight.

There are numerous game-breaking bugs that ruin the game for me, such as:\n-Crew Members will not follow orders\n-Only the Captain will respond to orders when giving a group command (Such as Gunners, Boarders, etc)\n-When capturing a ship your crew will fly into the ocean (I wish this was a joke)\n-Captain decided to grapple to the bottom of the ocean\n\nThat's just to name the few I've experienced in my hour of play.\nOverlooking the bugs, I think this will be a good game when it gets out of early access. However I cannot really assess the game in it's current state as I can't get far enough to experience anything other than 1 or 2 ship battles.","June 23, 2014","false","1.5"," 18 of 26 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","18","26","0","6"

Sometimes you need to act fast and give your mates orders, but its not working because there are only a few simple orders that wont help you in many situations(Game its like controlling a Sim, but you dont know why that guy isnt doing what you want...)\n\nThe Help Page is a good start but it isnt really helpfull in a detail. You will find yourself searching the web after a while.\n\nUseless crew, i dont really could figure out why should i buy more crew members. I was fine doing with my Captain alone. He doesnt consume as much food, his morale is mostly fine and since the AI is not listening to your orders you are not raging as much you would do otherwise.\n\nIn my opinion this Game is not finished, i dont know how the late content ist because i never reached that because of bugs.\n\n\nNow let me explain the bugs:\nIt seems like if you put more food in a barrel(Meat +7) it simply breaks the barrel and the chef is ignoring the barrel. (Some food as to be cooked by a chef)\nYou can not design your Ship as you want, because if you do any mistake(you simply dont know what you did wrong) the AI keeps walking around and simply tries everything at one, leading to a walking crew member that walk up and down.\n\nSome of my crew members where dying for no reason. They simply explode while sailoring. Since there is no what happend log that you can scroll up and down. Reloading where helpfull this bug happend only 3 times in my gametime.\n\nI have done bounty hunter mission, after sailing away from the island i ran into a fight that i have lost, i pressed r(reload saved state) and wanted to buy on that isle some health potions, and the bounty mission was done, like before but the guy where alive again and he ♥♥♥♥♥ me so hard that i could not get away. Game Over.\n\n\nSo as you can see this game offers a nice gameplay and it makes fun that is no question, but this comes to an end when you encouter gamebreaking bugs.\n\n\nI hope they will update the game as soon as possible, then i will ofc delete this review.If you want to work around the bugs i can guarantee you it will be very hard.","August 2, 2014","false","17.0"," 26 of 41 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","26","41","0","0"

The biggest problem is a lack of any useful tutorial in a game that is moderately complicated. There isn't a lot of helpful tooltips or anything useful on the help page and 4 hours in I still find myself search for answers on the internet to find out what is wrong constantly or how to do things I should be able to do, such as firing a cannon after buying cannons, ammo and using the cannon firing skill.\n\nAnother huge problem is large portions of this game involve doing nothing. Everytime you have to sail somewhere which is very often you merely watch your pirates sail on their ship with little to no involvement. This plays itself like an extended loading screen every 2 minutes in game.\n\nThe last problem that is that controls are very minimal in this game and I find myself at the hands of the AI constantly even during battles. A battle can vary wildly from complete victory with almost no health lost to my captain dieing because he decided to fight on the edge of the ship and got pushed off. There are of course smalls ways to remedy these things however a better remedy would be having the player be far more involved in battles.\n\nOverall the game is complex and engaging but has some major problems. It is definitely worth trying for cheap or worth revisiting later.","April 30, 2015","false","6.8"," 21 of 32 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","21","32","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/recommended/264140/","rockstarcro","RockstarCRO","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/","252 products in account","I will recommend this game, but cautiously to a few.\n\nPixel piracy offers a 2D RPG platform game with minimal controls. Pirates in essence manage themselves while you the player, tell them where to go, organize them in groups, and ensure they have enough food to eat.\n\nThe mouse allows you to control your pirates. Jumping ship to ship or to land is as easy as clicking over the location (or at). Some ships cannot be boarded right away, but are in range of cannons. Cannons fire while the ships approach one another. Boarding another ship can take some time as the ships have to come into proximity with one another. The ships don't physically move, but the timer countdown at the bottom does (hue hue hue hue[static.tumblr.com]). There are different types of cannons, and not everyone can use a cannon. Different pirates can acquire different abilities once given a skill book. Some can navigate faster, some can heal others, some can repair the ship, and some can specialize in combat. Pirates can be put into groups by the player to make selecting easier. For example, some pirates will have the ability to fire cannons, therefor putting these pirates into the "cannon" group can keep them on your ship while telling trainees, ship crew or other groups to go board and attack. There are specific attributes that can be upgraded with each pirate. Strength, vitality and dexterity are a few attributes to consider. I've mostly focused keeping them all nicely rounded, but it does help to have a few guys with good aim on the cannons, or wielding a gun. Passive items such as cooking knives can be given to pirates, as well as a secondary side arm meant for ranged attacks. Ranged attacks can be in the form of tomahawks, to flintlock pistols. When boarding or attacking another pirate's ship, once all the opposing pirates are deceased, the player may choose to capture the ship or sink it once all crew members are safely aboard your ship. Sinking a ship will give you some material and gold.\n\nShips can be modified to ones will, given the right materials. When docking on islands, the ships food supply can be restocked, cannons can be added, and even ship materials can be added to expand the boat. Building the boat in the editor doesn't require a lot of skill and is straight forward. Islands boast different shops. Some will have taverns (to hire pirates), some will have goods and item stores, some will have weapon stores, and some will have ship stores. Within these stores small little gimmicks appear as the player should read the fine prints of each item carefully. Pirates need certain items like fruit to prevent scurvy (you'll notice randomly some pirates will simply lose HP). Some pirates that you hire are not up to par, and at the ship store, spare swords can be bought for them to practice with. They need to be installed on a ship manually for it to come into effect.\n\nThe visuals are appropriate for the game, and have some small effects that really require a double take. Animations are smooth and kept simple. Sounds are varying as all pirates will have something different to say, but have no problem repeating themselves! The most notable sound in game is the splashing, it's refreshing!\n\nI like the game, but once you get to a certain point you'll have enough of it. You'll feel like you've done what you can and the only difference is the level of your opponents. This is why I'm carefully recommending it. For a game that is ON SALE and worth a couple of bucks, it's not bad for a few hours of entertainment. If you really want replayability from this game, you'll probably lean to one side of the fence. There is the exception for those who like endless adventure and like competing for a top score.\n\nIndie Rating : 7.6/10\n\nStandalone Game : 6.0/10\n\nA multiplayer feature somewhere in the game may have added a few more points. I would have liked to have a bit more control over my pirates and been actively involved in the fighting rather than observing.\n\nScreenShots :\nThis is what you will be commonly looking at\n\nWhile in the loading screen, pirates go about their business\n\nI've upgraded to a bigger ship\n\nThis is what the world map looks like\n\nMy biggest ship to date","June 16, 2015","true","9.0"," 14 of 19 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","14","19","0","0"

I think this would be an amazing game if it weren't for a few things that I personally find hard to get past. First of all I dislike the AI for crew mates and captains. You will order them to head in one direction to escape but they turn around and charge the enemy. On top of that the world menu has a VERY rough design. I think if they made that to fit the scheme of the game it would be very nice looking. Some of the good things about this game is suprisingly it has a ton of action.

If they come back and fix the memory leaks, broken non working items / skills and grammar errors among the male and female pirates. Then it would be worth a buy. As it stands it is pretty shallow and buggy. Not worth full price as it is now. (9/21/15)\n\nEnemy islands range from level 1 to 10 threat.\nEnemy boats range from level 1 to 10 threat.\nTowns range from level 1 to 10 size.\n\nThat's it. There all the same just skinned differently.\n\nSPOILERS\n\nIf they fixed items and the memory leaks you could build giant ships and full crews. As it stands you can get away with 12 crew and a small ship with little lag. Anything bigger and the game crawls along. Most the ship items do not even work as intended and serve only as a means to create lag. Skills cap at 19 so if you try and give a pirate a skill book they hold it instead of learning / increasing existing skill. This can be avoided if you leave the pirate at 18 skills. Ultimate skills do not work, they do eat skill slots though. There is no level cap, so once you hit a certain level you can steam roll everything. Range weapons do not level from use, only with a grindstone R that lowers in % chance to work. Female pirates are classed along with males in tavern and dialogue chats. So it is hard to know if the pirate in a tavern is a female or male. Their bios are all wrong he/she when it is a female has he in bio. Bios seem to do nothing. Don't bother buying different food, just buy fruit or watermelons.\n\nNeat game only to be sank by a rushed delivery out the door.","September 21, 2015","false","34.4"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

I bought it after watching the video, which made it look really fun.\n\nWell, some alpha/beta versions of games are really fun and polished. Some aren't.\n\nThe question is, as of now is it as fun as I thought it would be after watching the gameplay video? Not at all. I really like pixels and I really like pirates, so I absolutely like this as a concept. But as the game is now I don't recommend buying it until a lot more work is done.\n\nIt's too grindy, everything takes too much time investment to get, and is too easy to lose in a fight. Pirates start with absolutely no skills and you need to buy books to teach them everything AND have talent points to read the book on top of that. If a pirate dies all your investment is gone.\n\nThe game world feels really static. You "encounter" enemy ships and can choose to engage them or try to run away, but once you commit to enganging them they just sit there and don't attack you. Pirate ships don't move around on the world map, either.\n\nOnly buy the game now if you want to fund its development, not because you want to have fun playing an early version of it.","March 14, 2014","false","7.3"," 53 of 93 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","53","93","0","0"

It's easy to spend countless hours on this. You can build your own ship and gather your own crew to explore the very vast world while gaining numerous loots from defeating various enemies, both in land and by the sea (enemy ships).\n\nThe ship-building aspect is the most fun to me; different design gives you different advantages and challenges. Bigger ship doesn't always mean better. You gain parts to build your ship either from stores or from raiding other ships.\n\nHOWEVER there are three glaring issues the devs need to fix.\n\n- Very poor documentation. For the most part, you have to figure things by your own. Like cleaning your ship from poos (yes, your crew will poo from time to time). Not cleaning your ship affects your crew quality of life. I had to google for this simple information.\n- Poor user interface. You won't feel it during early hours, but near the late game where you find yourself amassed with numerous loots, it will start becoming tedious to manage those hundreds of items.\n- Lack of varieties. This one you will also feel near the late game. After you've traveled 50% of the world map, you'll know you've discovered most of the world. You've seen all varieties of enemy ships, islands, and towns.\n\nDespite those three glaring issues, I still recommend this game. It's still a decent game if you like open world game.\n\nGet it ONLY when it's on discount.

Or better train them to swim or properly poop? :D Your crew will become hungry and grumpy (take care that they not turn against you!), so you should buy food, train your crew to fish and another one to cook. I remember that I starved on my first try to play the game. You are also able to take jobs as a bounty hunter to kill a good skilled pirate, if you think you are strong enough to make it. There are so many funny things they say and chanties they sing to raise the moral, or the items you can find (of course will a pink bra boost your moral!!) And also a big negative item I don’t want to spoil. And don’t forget to plunder and takeover enemy encounter ships or just build your own awesome ship.\n\nYou will not regret buying this game.

You sail to islands and into other pirate ships and conquer your area which awards you with gold, loot, and exp. Gold you can use to buy food (so your pirates wont get unhappy), buy ship building blocks, new traits for pirates (which allow them to do a specific task, like clean the poop deck or use cannons). Loot as in weapons (that are upgradable with rare stones) and passive items (that can give more atk, or can heal a player) and exp that levels up each of your pirates, that you can buy more of with gold, which gives your pirate TP. TP is used to upgrade your pirates different skills, Str Vit, Int, Dex, Agi, and luck, which help your pirates accomplish things more effienciently.\n\nThe game is not perfectThe game has some issues, there is a memory leak that makes it too slow to play around an hour or so into the game, but this isnt a huge deal. Restarting your client isnt the worse downside a game has ever had, and this problem does not make this game any less enjoyable. Some people have said that the pirate voices make this game annoying as hell. This should not be a problem, In the settings you can turn off these slighlty annoying pirate voices, if you do not care to here "Avast ye mateys" about once a minute, so people that complain about this, really arnt grasping the entire game, and arnt really giving you alot of insight of how the game and all of its aspects works.\nSo, why does the game have a few problems? Well, this game was made by just a handful of people, that all had day jobs, this was a side-project type game, and its amazing how much the game exploded in popularity and how great the game is for how much time actually went into it.\n\nThis game was NOT "abandoned" by the developers, these guys worked their ASSES OFF, while STILL having ANOTHER JOB! These developers deserve so much more credit for what they did here. And for those saying "well, if they havnt abandoned it why dont they fix the memory leak, and other problems?" They have told time and time again, that to fix these problems, they would basically have to recode the entire game, which would be alot of man power and woundnt pay off as much as this game actually did. The developers have given away free keys to people who couldnt afford it, and these guys are amazing, Im looking forward to the lauch of "PIXEL PRIVATEERS" that is coming out THIS quarter of 2016, and I hope many open thier eyes and see that this game really is a gem, and privateers will be even better! :)\n\nJudgement 9/10The game is a neat management + rpg styled game, that gives you control of a pirate crew on your quest to defeat all 4 of the legendary pirates, the game has a few issues, like the memory leak that makes you re-open the game every hour or so. But these issues do not interphere with the great idea this game was. The achievements for the game are quite fun to complete and there is quite alot of places you can go and conquer even after you have defeated all 4 of the legendary pirates. This game is one of my most favorite games, if not my #1 favorite, and I believe everyone should try it out :)","March 5","true","43.2"," 19 of 30 people (63%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","63","19","30","4","0"

The freedom given us from the very start of the game is total, and the possibility of building and customizing every part of your ship and any aspect of your crew gives a real forward boost in the overall freedom experience given to the player.\n\nEven if it has colorful palettes, a minimalistic (but indeed functional) HUD and rather simple base mechanics, you will be surprised at the complexity of the overall system as you proceed in the adventure: from a small group of pirates, you will be in charge of managing a large crew, composed even of tens of individuals, each one with its up and down sides, needs, skills and behavior. Soon you will take the role of a true captain, assigning each member of your crew to the job which suits them best, ration the food supplies, teach the right skills at the right guys, and be careful to do that, because in Pixel Piracy every mistake costs lives, and coins!\n\nIf the management part seems deep enough, then you will be lost in the exploration one. The game features procedurally generated worlds, this means every game will be different, every island a new discovery, every encounter a different fight. Repetitivity is a stranger to this game, because with the combination of hundreds of randomly generated items, tools, ships and enemies, it is successful in mantaining itself fresh and new every time you play.\n\nThe combat system is also full of fun and depth itself. Battles will be always different in relation of where they take place. A battle on an island can see your fellow footsoldiers roam through the sandy beaches, staining them with red blood, aided by the ship's artillery team raining death upon their foes, while a battle in the open sea is a true confrontation of two captains and their own vessels: cannons blazing, bullets flying, pirates drowning, hulls breaking and men boarding each other's ship with fierce brutality and desire for loot. Only the best skills, tactics and yeah, also luck, will determine whi wins and who sinks.\n\nWell, that's all folks, there are other features in the game but i decide to leave them upon you to discover. There is a big world in these little pixels, and it is full of wonders.","November 3, 2015","true","4.9"," 15 of 23 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","15","23","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DementedMind/recommended/264140/","DementedMind","Demented Mind","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DementedMind/","276 products in account","I had a lot of fun playing this game. This is review might be a bit like a guide if you read later on about stats.   As I recall, I managed to get this game from one of the bundles so I got my money well invested here.   In this game, you start with the first character as a captain of your measly ship with no cannons.   Early on, you will have no money to hire pirates to work or fight for you.   There are many different skills that can be learned from books which can be purchased from stores or uncommon drops from pirates and loots.   The funny thing is that you need Cleaning skill to sweep your ship clean of poop, literally.   So naturally at start, you will be having bundles of poop on your ship before you come across a Cleaning skillbook.   I'm going to make a list of Pros and Cons:\n\nPros\n1- Design and build your ship (check out screenshots submitted by players, one looked like Star Wars' destroyer ship)\n2- Can hire up to 20 pirates making you feel like you have a real army going.  Especially if you had 15 of them as boarders...or even gunners...shreding ships apart before 30 seconds timer to expire allowing boarding\n3- Different game every time (But as I noted under Cons, the ship/island scenarios are repetitive)\n4- Variety of melee and ranged weapons\n\nCons\n1- This game is not exactly finished as there are few things I can tell that need to be fixed or implemented (you may encounter some bugs.  I once encountered a game-breaking bug when I was stuck on a corner of a block on enemy ship, they would not target me, I could not fire my pistol at them...making it seem like I no longer exist there, had to reload but all was fine that point on)\n2-  Now, I said that you play this game different every time as this is a good thing.  But the scenarios is probably 1 major patch away from being just about right.  The ship and island scenarios is all you will encounter in the game.  Once you see both of them,  it is pretty much 90% the same.  The only difference is levels of difficulty, which increases as you move farther away from your starting point.  So naturally this hampers replayability.\n4- Interface need some optimization or something.  In-game scroll is a bit of pain as I can't use my mouse scroll button. This is enchanced when you got a long list of items to navigate. (and that is another thing, no subcategories of items)\n5- While this was fun at first, but after recongizing the optimal way to develop your war-oriented priates and yourself,  the fun start to fade out quickly as you and your pirates become overwhelming powerful.  Case in point,  getting your dodge chance (via increasing points in AGI) to 500% (if you are a lone wolf attacker; and 500% because the more enemies on you, the higher penalty on your dodge chance)  No one can really hit you.  Up against 8-10 pirates on the ship, they get to hit you maybe 2 or 3 times.   As I said about ship/island scenarios being all virtually identical other than levels of difficulty (Edge of map is 8 to 10), it gets dull after while seeing you single-handedly shred them apart repeatedly in the virtually same way over and over.\n6-  As some reviews may have noted, the stats are vague,  what they directly tell you is what it is but there seem to be additional things that impact them.\n\nThe stats are (and you start with 1 in each):\nSTR:  +5% bonus damage\nVIT:  +1 hp regen / +1 armor per 10 VIT points / +6 health per VIT point (You also gain healthpool via leveling)\nINT:  +2 passive XP\nDEX: +5% ranged damage / +2% hit chance (Base is 90% hit chance so you start at 92% because 1 point already)\nAGI:  +5% dodge chance\nLUCK:  +1 critical chance\n\nI finished my first full game as of this review so my comments and experience with stats are:\n\nSTR's 5% bonus melee damage per point is very straightforward.\n\nNext game I am going to try maximizing VIT to determine the effect of +1 armor per 10 VIT points.  As of now, I assume it reduce damage taken by 1.  From my experience from taking damages,  it looks like I take up to 30 damage or little so.  This exclude  bombers as they hurt quite a bit (Gunners that happened to have cannon ammo on their hands when I boarded)  So in theory, if I manage to get VIT to 100 (can be more)   I probably would be immune to about 30-40% of enemies in the game.  I will try this in my next game.\n\nINT's passive XP is what it is, you actually gain XP periodically.  Increasing INT allow you to gain more passive XP over time.  But this alone is junk.  At level 120, I need about 30k exp to level which I can level once per high-difficult level pirate ship scenario.   What it does not mention, is that increasing points in INT seem to increase % learn from skillbooks.   I noticed that myself had just 1 point in INT (as I never bother with it) while my ship crew  have all points in INT to help them level faster.  When I read skillbooks to increase my already-learned skill levels, I didn't gain very much which meant I needed multiple skillbooks per level.   Now when I gave certain books to my shipcrews with high INT, they only needed 1 skillbook per level.   So increasing INT allow you to benefit more from skillbooks however in the long-run this is not worth it for pirates including yourself that board and attack pirate ships.  INT is for pirates that stay on the ship and do duties.\n\nDEX's 5% bonus ranged damage is straightforward,  now about hit chance%.   The higher difficulty pirates have more points in AGI which higher their dodge chance.  So naturally you will want to increase DEX a bit to compensate for that.\n\nAGI's 5% dodge chance.  This is what that is going to break the game for you.   If you invest (and you pretty much always should)  AGI all the way to 100 (500% dodge chance)   you, as a lone wolf, can single-handedly deal with Legendary Pirate's ship alone.  The more enemies on you, the higher penalty on your dodge chance, so naturally at 500% dodge chance already, you still will have near-100% dodge chance.  You might take 2-5 hits in the entire battle.\n\nLuck increases your chance to critical hit by 1%.  Naturally this might not seem worthy to you at all.  But to be frank, after AGI, this is the best stat ever.  STR is pointless as if you invest all 100 in Luck.  You will be critically damage enemies every time.  5x critical damage.   Naturally you will want fast attacking weapons to take advantage of critical.  Technically STR's 100 points = 500% damage which match critical but this does not include ranged weapon.  So Luck is definitely better.  After 100 points in Luck,  every point you invest in STR or DEX for ranged,  the 5% bonus damage is actually 25% because of critical.\n\nThe game is already seemingly trivial with 100 in AGI,  with addition of 100 in Luck,  everything became comical...and dull after while.  I quickly went straight to the corners of map to deal with 4 legendary pirates and get it over with. (but you can actually keep playing after this,  the game goes on forever, pretty much which is nice for players who adore this game.\n\nAnyway, my rating of this game is 7.5 / 10. Probably would be 8.5 or 9 if they release just 1 more major patch for this game but they already moved on to making next project with 10 people.\n\nEdit: with my test game focusing on nothing but VIT stat, at level 20 with 40 points in VIT.  I felt no  real improvements with +4 armor.  Either armor stat is a placebo or too small % reduction. I compared during combat against a single person. Was #9 VIT then added 1 VIT point to make it #0, gaining +1 armor, yet to see any reduction in damage. Abandoned test game, +10 armor (100 VIT) isn't going to be worth it.  So I am now considering these stats of  STR, VIT, and INT to be useless. The gain to get from these aren't worth it compare to other 3 stats.  Invest only in DEX (up to max 40 for optimal hit chance against high difficult pirates), AGI (up to 100) and Luck (100).  Anything beyond, just invest whatever.","November 22, 2015","true","28.4"," 16 of 25 people (64%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","64","16","25","2","3"

Your pirates will drop large, steaming piles of human dung all over your ship wherever they are standing, whenever they feel the need to go -- which is often. Seagulls will land on your ship and when one of your pirates scares them away, the birds will also drop a deuce on your deck.  Inevitably, the pirate involved in the confrontation will pinch off a loaf in celebration. The piles of poo will make your crew sick, but they WILL. NOT. STOP. The only way to mitigate this fecal onslaught is by equipping your crew with Diapers, and levelling up one of several poop-related skills from a modest skill tree.  There is a "perk" that makes a crew member into a Poop Machine.  You can train them in Toilet Mastery.\n\nThe game also features some light exploration and simplistic point-and-click combat.\n\nPROS: There are very few Pirate-themed games out there. This is one of them.\nCONS: This is a game about pooping.\n\nUPDATE: The game has made it out of Early Access. Congratulations are due!\n\nThese are several "improvements" added in version 1.0, as per the changelog:\n* BETTER POOP SPLASH EFFECT\n* Pirates will no longer poop if they are hungry (less than 50% hunger)\n* Pirates will now clean the nearest poop instead of any old poop\n* Flying poop now deals 5% max HP damage (as opposed to a small fixed value)\n\nIn a way, it's refreshing that they are sticking to their guns with this.","July 30, 2014","false","16.3"," 46 of 82 people (56%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","56","46","82","2","4"

The menu system is extremely buggy and despite being able to put your crew into seperate groups to better organize them it isn't saved on death or loading a saved game. This becomes a huge pain later in the game when you have a huge crew and you've specifically set up certain crew members for certain jobs.\n\nYou can hire new crew members but have no control over what kind of stats they will have or what type of character they will be. Your main character has to do all the treasure digging which requires changing out your melee weapon to a shovel half the time.\n\nThe combat system is very aggrivating. Once in combat you can't control who your crew is going to attack and will often mean you are in a corner fighting while the rest of your crew is on a free for all rampage to the death or victory. The only way to keep members alive is to constantly pause the game then load the crew member screen. Not to mention if you do not teach every single crew member to swim they will die if they get knocked in the water which later on in the game happens a lot.\n\nThe tooltips in the game for items are very vague. Half of them feel poorly translated from another language other than english.\n\nI didn't spend much on this game and I'm glad. This game is no where near the quality of Terraria so do not let that trailer fool you into thinking otherwise.","December 27, 2014","false","16.7"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

Terribly. The issue seems to be that even if you have a well-sized crew able to handle all the cleaning, during ship encounters the crew doesn't clean, so the animal poo piles up, and once it does the game lags tremendously, even after the ship is clean. Restarting the game was the only fix (without changing the animal count) until another ship encounter inevitably causes the issue again. I wouldn't bring this up if it seemed an extreme thing to do, but as there is an achievement for capturing 50 animals you'd think the game should be able to handle even a quarter of that. I ended up having to toss a lot of my animals sea-side, alas. :(\n\nWith that in mind, here are the good points of the game. If you're someone who likes to loot and level up in plenty, you'll find the opportunity to do so here in spades.

The downside to this is that over-leveling makes the legendary pirates look terribly easy (especially the ones without cannons, shame on them), and I was never boarded even once. :P\n\nA lot of other reviews discuss the lack of novelty with new areas, but that didn't quite bother me, as I saw them as just opportunities to level up more and build up an even more bad-♥♥♥ crew. For the enjoyment in the game was the story I attributed to my crew members through the trials they faced (like the time it was just two of us on the initial one-level vessel, and we single-handedly took down a medium-sized Order ship :P), their little personality blurbs, and unique statting they all had, preferring some to have more strength vs. dexterity or the like. So the game offers to you as much as you're willing to put into it. If you prefer games though that present a real story for you to follow along with however, you should look elsewhere.\n\nThis is probably the longest game review I've written for a game and it's because it's been such a journey, like day in and day out for over ten days on this game, it feels more then just silly pirates messing around. My pirates had character. Definitely will be revisiting this game in the future because the pirate life is the one for me~","February 17","true","51.6"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","2"

Now come the 1.0 release, I'm able to give my honest opinion after a couple hours in with a lv. 13 captain:\n\nThe game is very relaxing. It's got some humor in it and a couple of references in it as well (The ones I noticed are from Pirates of the Carribean), what's worth mentioning here however is that there is an emphasis on pirates taking dumps, more than you might expect at a glance, which to some is funny, others maybe not so much. That said, you might want to spend some of your first gold pieces on a Cleaner skill book.\n\nAnother thing to take note of is that the game still does not have much in the way of content: So far I've only seen pirate ships (Without cannons, we'll see how that works out once I get there) and islands. There is little variety in the types of encounters you might see while playing, which does make the gameplay a bit repetitive. Of course, every one of these encounters will be different, with different ship layouts and assortment of enemies, which makes it feel less of a chore. Also there'll be future content patches for this game, which may further add to the experience.\n\nThe game also has a fair amount of equipment for customizing your troops, as well as different combat mechanics such as critical hits, bleeding and of course, the drowning of your deckhands should you get swarmed by enemies that attack one character and there is no wall behind you. This causes slight issues because as I was playing through this game I did not manage to have complete control over what enemy my deckmates were attacking, which makes the tactical element of the game a bit harder to execute.\n\nThere's plenty of charm in the game as well. Many of your new recruits have "special" abilities that makes them interesting. I had one that made my pirate attack its teammates every once in a while, resulting in him eventually getting killed when vikings boarded my ship. There's plenty more out there and that is something I definitely approve of.\n\nThat said, it is an indie game, and for it being an indie game it's definitely not bad. I quite liked spending some hours seeing my Dubstarr & Co. slicing up enemies with his Falcon Blade, and come another day when I fancy some pixellated pirate caretaking, I'll probably look back at my save file and play some more.\n\nPlus for what you pay for it, this game's worth it. Especially now with its launch deal of -50%.","July 31, 2014","true","5.1"," 40 of 72 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","40","72","0","0"

I understand this was a lot of work for you guys and thank you for putting in the effort.

Pirates will still not clean or fix the ship at times for absolutely no reason.\n\nFurthermore, I think we need to have a little talk as to what balance means. Balance is tweaking certain values of the weapons and enemies and bringing them closer together to keep the game challenging later on, while not making things arbitarily difficult.\n\nMy captain ran around with a spear for quite some time. Then finally, everyone was ready and the crew took on one of the legendary pirates. After a long battle the enemy captain finally fell and from his body 'the butterfly' was recovered.  A great weapon, even more powerful than my level 20 spear, so of course I immediately gave it to my captain as a symbol of a hard-won victory.\n\nImagine my surprise when I started playing today and my captain appeared to be hitting his enemies with a bloody wiffle bat. Oh lookie, the weapon we took from the legendary captain suddenly does base damage 17 at level 10........Yeah, sorry first mate Rogers, but could you please give the captain his spear back? Turns out the weapon wielded by the legendary captain turned into a piece of ♥♥♥♥ overnight.\n\nYeah, you're right, fighting that captain seems a whole lot less rewarding all of a sudden.

As well as this, the gameplay is rather solid, playable and fun.\n\nThat is, until about halfway through the game.\n\nThis game definitely needs to be worked on, since there are bugs galore, the game becomes very unbalanced (particularly due to the concept of MORALE), and it generally just becomes frustrating. I chose to play this game in the easiest game mode, dubbed "Sailor Mode". This is simply because I wanted to explore the gameplay aspects and obtain all of the achievements this game has to offer first, before I began challenging myself. However, even in this game mode I found that the game eventually got to an unplayable state due to the tedious sailing required just to keep my crew members happy.\n\nI would probably recommend this game to just about anyone if the game was balanced and saved from the frustrating bugs that dominate every last corner, but otherwise this just needs to be worked on.\n\nBut from what it looks like, I don't think that will be happening, considering that the developers have invested all of their interests into 'Pixel Privateers'.\n\nAll other aspects of this game are perfect. It is just these very annoying things that make this game literally 'sink'.","March 27","false","51.6"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","3"

The gameplay is very good and hard also it will take you loads of tries over and over again to get some stuff right but its fun the goal of the game is basically your a pirate and you hire your crew , capture / attack other ships and go to different islands and search for loot and build your own ship and you also need to see how long you surive for. Ill defo be recording some footage and uploading it to youtube soon.\n\nThe best thing of all is that the developers have uploaded there full entire game on there website for free as a torrent file at www.piracysim.com I just choice to buy the game because I think these devs defo deserve the money for there effort and I don't like pirating games... hahaha you get it?\n\nOverall score id give is 8/10 very awesome game! id highly recommend it for fun and to pass the time if your bored.","December 12, 2013","true","3.9"," 36 of 67 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","36","67","0","4"

The same group that brought us Terraria! Vitali Kirpu of Quadro Delta, as I've been informed is the developer behind the fantastic art and mechanics you see in-game. (Hope I worded that right. Wanted to get my info correct and give credit where it's deserved)\n\nOnward! To the juicy details!\n\nPros:\n+Play as a pirate!\n+Free-build your own pirate ship!\n+Hire your own pirate goons! (Lots of them about)\n+Capture pets! (haven't figured out how that relates to gameplay yet)\n+Visit many, MANY islands in search of loot (and various other things)!\n+Unique RPG/Level up/Inventory system\n+Casual gameplay (Good one to play before bed, lots of interaction involved too)\n+Bit of grinding for items and loot (but the way it's set up, it's not overwhelming or tiring)\n+Attractive 8-bit graphics (If you're like me and like that sort of thing)\n+Everything I love in a casual game!\n\nCons:\n\n-Sometimes have difficulty building a ship\n(The game states the 'path to ship is unreachable' when it seems like nothing is wrong. Sometimes I'll have to get rid of a hull block that hangs too low or a background decoration for it to work properly. Frustrating, but no big deal.)\n-Turtorial could be a bit more descriptive.\n(I jumped to the tutorial via in-game menu for a few various things [including the ship building thing I mentioned above] and didn't see the answer I was looking for. Again had to figure it out myself, which can be good or bad. Personally, I like figuring things out for myself to a certain degree.)\n-Crew/Character level up screens aren't descriptive enough.\n(You get your inventory, physical attributes and can place your crewmates under certain labels [BOARDER if you want them to stay on the ship during battle!], but you have to view their current ailment status above their character on the main screen. Which is a bit tedious and took a while to figure out as well.)\n-A few graphical elements could use improvement.\n(The sun and moon in particular look like they just don't belong at the moment. I feel weather effects could also use a bit of improvement. Just my own personal critical opinion.)\n-No way to 'fire' pirates, but you can always kill them if you don't want them on your crew anymore.\n-NOT a con, just a warning. Watch out for scurvy!\n\nAs you can see, the cons are many, but also minute. The pros heavily outweigh the cons in my opinion. I can definitely look past the details I mentioned with all the effort and intelligence that has gone into this game. If you like Terraria, there's a 7/10 chance you'll like this too. As far as I know, there is no form of traditional crafting as far as acquirable items are concerned and building is reduced to you building your own personal pirate ship. Though, I haven't played the game long and I would imagine you could build your own pirate island further on in the game.\n\nOne can hope!\n\nYou can make up your own mind on this one.\n\nMy verdict...\nBUY IT!

For the most part I had a lot of fun with it, it's rather simple, and is a easy game to play during boring lectures.  It a fun level grind, with the potential to invest heavy in some crew members and/or make some expendable.  The mechanics are fairly simple once you get the hang of things.\n\nThat being said, I would advise playing the game muted, or at the very least turn off the character voices.  In a way they're all like pokemon and only have one line which they repeat over and over again in some incredibly annoying voices.  Despite all this, the main reason I can't recommend this game is the fact that you can't finish it.  I mean you could if you were down to restart every 3 battles, but I'm really not into that.  I read the reviews on memory leaks and I thought "nah it'll be fine" .  It wasn't.  After investing a few hours into what seemed to be a really great game, I came to the realization I wouldn't get to complete it.\n\nIt's a great time waster, but you could easily find something just as fun and for free, or at least cheaper, in flash games.  Like most of the other reviews I would only recommend this if it were on sale for under $5, that alone doesn't get it a thumbs up though.\n\n\nEDIT: Upon further review, it would seem the developers still care about the game and community and are still trying to patch things to help with the lag and other features.  While I wouldn't say the game has been fixed by any rate, I do appreciate developers that don't give up their product.  That, along with the hope that one day the memory leak issues will be fixed, is reason I am changing my recommendation to a thumbs up for this game.","February 13","true","23.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","1"

It\'s a simple concept, however the game is built upon leveling your crew and building up your ship, while managing, morale, hunger, gold. There has been controversy, due to it having large gaps between updates, leading to it being called a 'typical Early Access game'. This, however, is not the case anymore, bugs are uncommon, and the game is a fully fledged title.

However, lack of UI clarity and a vague item description hold this one back. Here\'s a basic list of pros and cons in my opinion.\n\nPROS:\n\n-Lots of islands to visit.\n-Fun but simple combat.\n-Killing pirates and getting loot is satisfying.\n-Neat pixel graphics.\n-Expanding and building your own ship/crew is enjoyable and motivating.\n\nCONS:\n\n-UI is vague and difficult to navigate.\n-Weapons stores tell very little of what the weapons actually do.\n-When buying crew members, it\'s basically a box of chocolates; you never know what you\'re gonna get (again, thanks to the crummy, nondescript UI).\n-A constant loot stream in the side of the screen makes it difficult to keep track of any particularly good loot you\'ve gained without checking your inventory periodically.\n\nI got this game on sale for roughly $2.50. I figured I could supplement one cup of coffee this week for a full fledged indie game, and I think it was worth it.

So this game was made by Quadro Delta and published by Re-Logic the same people who made Terraria. That raises the expectation that the game should be good it was made by some of the people who made Terraria which is universally praised as being a good game. Does the game met that expectation? Let’s talk about the gameplay, graphics, story, and sound to find out.\nGameplay:\nOn the games website the game is marketed as a strategy/sandbox/simulation. Is that true? Only partially the game’s only “strategy” comes from the fact you can control your captain and pirates and point them at the thing you’d like dead. The “simulation” comes from your pirates needing food and pooping on your ship since they’re too stupid to realize that they should be doing that on the island and not the thing they live on. Why would they poop on the ship? Because it’s on the poop deck (hur hur hurrr) the game has a very immature sense of humor more on that later. The only true thing that the advertise the game as is a sandbox the game’s map is kind like FTL’s where there are these “beacons” that you can sail to that have things to do on them unlike FTL you actually land on the islands you may pass. Every island you go to will feel the same though more on that later. So how do you control the game? Left clicking for controlling the captain and right clicking for the crew group you have selected. How about combat? It’s the same control scheme left click to tell the captain you’d like that thing dead and right click to tell the crew you’d like that thing dead. The combat must be pretty cool sword fighting on a ship sounds like it’d be awesome, not here you click the target and hope your pirate hit’s harder and more often since it’s pretty RNG dependent one of the biggest variables is knock back where falling off the ship/island means death by very lazy looking shark sprites (no they don’t even have a eating animation). You can increase your odds of hitting by the RPG style leveling system they have where you just slap some points into a stat like strength to hit harder or dexterity to dodge better or put the points into a skill like cleaning this goes for crew members as well. Speaking of the crew you have to hire them at a tavern where they’ll charge you x amount for their services and they’ll have a blurb with what they did before becoming a pirate does that mean anything? Of course not. There’s a moral system in where being on a ship covering in their waste makes them grumpy to mitigate this you could pay them their wages, go fight another pirate, or clean that stuff up. You can also capture and tame animals to be crew members though they’re effectively the exact same thing only dumber (can’t learn skills). There’s a hunger system as well where the pirates get grumpy when their hungry and eventually starve to death this was a big problem with larger crews since they were too stupid to eat when they were hungry I hear that isn’t an issue in the “Enhanced edition. There’s a travel time system that seems to serve no purpose aside from free EXP and loading in the next area. The AI for the game seems pretty terrible where they don’t avoid hazards and don’t position themselves to avoid environmental kills like getting knocked off the ship.\nGraphics:\nThe game is retro sprite based which maybe a turn off for some since so many games do that since it’s cheaper. Normally they make sure they actually have animations in before shipping out the game though. The animation quality in this game is terrible it tries to do the South Park thing by having the sprite shuffle from left to right and sword swings are just the sword sprite moving from and upward position to a downward position. The games UI is pretty ugly there’s way to much unused space with the color scheme they chose and way too much clicking to get where the player wants. The game’s style is pretty ugly to the point where the game’s cards from steam poke fun at them such as the one for the cat where it says it looks more like a sausage weasel than a cat, that’s all over the place in this game. The water looks decent at least. The things that live in the water don’t though the sharks look pretty stupid as do the fish who just kinda slide around in the water without any semblance of an animation to be found here. The areas the player visits are randomly generated to my knowledge that doesn’t stop them from looking all exactly the same. Every island has the exact same back drop EVERY SINGLE ONE at least have like 3 different looking ones that the game picks out at random for the islands. Making a sprite is a relatively easy thing to do animating one is difficult but that’s no excuse for a game that’s selling for $10. For that can get you all sorts of good games on steam like Terraria all of which will have animations.\nStory:\nThe isn’t much of one it’s just go kill the 4 big name pirates and you can choose what kind of back story you want for the captain, was their dad a brave pirate, was he a drunk pirate, was he a coward. You get to name the world and decide it’s story by that I mean do you want more pirate encounters, do you want people you hire to be more likely to get sick, or are you a night owl and want night to last longer? Do you want it to be mysterious, do you want it to be a drama filled, or do you want it to be dangerous? That’s all you get. I’m not sure what age group this game is aimed at I’m going to assume kids since the game’s jokes and writing are normally just poop related or pointing out lazy item descriptions you know the highbrow stuff that everyone thinks is funny.\nSound:\nThe sound in this are pretty hit and miss the swords sound like hulks of metal clanging against each other the open sea sounds like the open sea but then there’s the voice acting it sounds awful. When you make your captain you pick a voice for them all of them sound like unprofessional, some of them sound like the dev’s child, and some of them only have a line that they spam. There’s singing in the taverns that sounded terrible to me but that might be your thing though. The games music is nothing special it just serves the ambiance although you’ll probably never find yourself humming anything from it.\nOverall Verdict:\nI bought this game on sale for a dollar since I oddly enough never heard anything bad about it. I still regret that purchase and this is coming from a guy who will buy games and just let them sit in his library where they gather digital dust. So is the game worth it? No not at all it’s just a boring game it boasts a 40 hour experience what it means it 40 hours of more or less the exact same thing there’s no real story there’s no twist it’s just a game you’d play if you had nothing better to do. It might make for a good mobile game but as a PC game it’s terrible you know a game is bad if the dev is ashamed of it hyping up a enhanced edition releasing it for free and then giving copies away out of his pocket. If a dev is that dead set on building up good will with their community they’ve had to release a real stinker. It leaves me baffled as to why there a so many positive reviews of the game on steam those were probably from when the game was in Early Access. The game just feels like it never left early access there isn’t much to it the graphics the gameplay it all feels like there was more planned for it like more than one backdrop for all the islands and how dumb the AI is.\nVideo Supplement: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1Z6aBtwh2Y","February 26, 2015","false","2.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

There's a few things that aren't explained very well, which leads you to reading up in the Community Guides before actually being able to play the game efficiently, otherwise you'll get discouraged and rue your whole $1.50 spent... lol.\n\nThe game is slow-growth to rewarding expansion. It's interesting though, because if you play your captain right, you can send him to solo 4 guys at once or more (I'm only Level 16) on a raid and win, with ease. The key is his Evasion. Then afterwards, everything is chump-change, however a gang of dudes (6+) will nuke him fast... lol.\n\nIt's fairly simple to understand, as the tutorial covers most of the functions. The HELP could use a lot of work, because its poorly written in understanding and explanation detail. There's also a lot of little quirk about the game that I wish could be changed.\n\n—Such As:\n\n-- If you have a fisherman with Cleaning, Fishing, and Cooking in his skills, but he has a Fishing Rod in hand, he will ONLY fish. He wont clean and he wont cook, which leaves you to removing his weapon and subbing in something else when you have a freakin' million fish because he's so damn good at it, lol. But then he'll cook everything on the deck and then clean up crap afterwards.\n\n-- Selling items is a pain in the #*$(^@#&@*(&ing ♥♥♥. If you clicking fast to dump crap from your inventory, you'll sell off some 700+$ item and hate yourself, life, and everything else while you're at it, because 700 is 3-4 pirate raids. There needs to be an item lock feature, or "secure chest" you can put those items in so they cant be sold. Like Shovels and Fishing rods, etc.\n\nAll in all, hunger and money run the game and if you can master them, the game is pretty much done with. ;)\n\nFun though.","November 29, 2015","true","7.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I think.\n\nSee, I'm not going to play it. I do have a reason for this, but you should no longer trust this review implicitly because maybe my reason is unfounded.\n\nSee, I read the statements made by the below mentioned producer in several posts made before this release. Here's what it boiled down to for me:\n\nWe couldn't fix this, so instead you should just play differently. We couldn't make multiple decks work because we hard coded the game poorly, so you should just not build multiple decks, but here's a micromanagement tool for you to use so your guys don't starve to death anymore. Ignore the fact that this isn't actually really any different from the previous way of assigning work, and please pay attention to the fact it's on a new menu.\n\nI mean seriously. What kind of shoddy solution is that? Maybe I'm misreading everything this guy is saying, but when a dev is willing to admit over and over that his mostly abandonded game that wasn't close to finshed on release doesn't function well and CAN'T BE MADE TO FUNCTION AS INTENDED EVER, PERIOD, it's kind of a sign that I wasted my money on it.\n\nOr, from the release notes itself:\n\n"Added rudimentary MOD SUPPORT (some game data is now loaded from xml files and can be overwritten in the new Mods folder, don't ask us how to do it, we don't know!) "\n\nNot a shock.\n\nPerhaps I'm just mad and frustrated with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ devs who run with my money, and even more so with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ devs who can do so while seeming like good guys because they are being "honest" and "transparent" about what they are doing. Like I say, you should read some other reviews too. But seriously....\n\n\nEdit: Having now put 30 hours into this, and having played several more patches, I still firmly stand beside what I have to say below. This is not a finished product, and the devs have now started work on another game. They claim this is a seperate team, but they also claim that only one person was really working on this game as kind of a hobby, and he is on that team. Which sort of makes me scratch my head and wonder who's still working on this game if it's not any of the people involved with it.\n\nI will admit that the game is slightly less broken than it was on release (though the above mentioned producer has no issue admitting it's still a buggy, barely functioning mess in his latest press release, which seems to have now been deleted :s), but I personally think most consumers expect the basic mechanics of a game to work after Alpha, not barely work half a year after full release.\n\nI feel my original review was fairly impartial and made other buyers aware of potential issues. Now I simply want to scream DONT BUY THIS CRAP. Blah.\n\nOriginal review:\n\nI have such mixed feelings on this game.\n\nOn one hand, I did throughly enjoy the 7 or so hours of gameplay I put into it before I had no choice but to fight pirates armed with cannons. There were a few little bugs here and there, but all in all the game does manage to have that "adventure" type feeling I just don't get from many games that promise it. Managing your crew doesn't devolve into ridiculous, time consuming mircomanagement (unless you want it to), there are enough items and skills and powerups to give it a decent RPGish type feeling, and most of the gameplay itself (beyond some of the "sail for six minutes while nothing happens" travelling moments) is pretty fun.\n\nOn the other hand, by the time those seven hours were up, most of foes I had to face were pretty easy to defeat, except those with the cannons. Who are so game breakingly annoying to defeat that i don't think I'll end up playing this again.\n\nIt's not a matter of things becoming to hard, it's a matter of them becoming pointless. Yes, I can sink the opposing ship with my own cannons, but then not only do I not feel very piratey (cause, you know, plunder and all), I end up wasting enough ammo and taking enough damage that it's financially impratical to bother trying.\n\nAnd yes, I can still board enemies to capture them, but for whatever reason, the devs have decided to make it so that whenever you attack a pirate holding a cannon ball (which seems to count for at least 2-3 of the enemy's crew), they explode. Even if this doesn't sink the enemy ship with your guys on it, they will envariably kill a few of them, which means I can either maintain a massive crew of low-level guys to use as fodder (once again costing far more than I'll make off of looting), or I can risk losing some of my skilled crew (which is not only yet again not nearly covered financially by my gains, but kind of a massive pain in the ♥♥♥ having spent hours building them to the point that I want them at).\n\nHeaven forbid some dudes holding cannonballs should get on your ship.\n\nThe other issue with cannons themselves is they make ship design less interesting. A borg cube suddenly becomes king of the waves because even though it can be damaged to the point where the battle was not worth it in terms of gold, it won't sink like a pretty Spanish galleon will when some dude gets stabbed while holding a cannonball on the lowest deck.\n\nSo, it's not a matter of things getting too hard - provided no one suicide bombs me, they are arguably a little too easy if anything. I just really dislike that after a certain point in the gameplay, everything I do begins to act as a step backwards. There is no point in proceeding if there are no gains.\n\nI'd probably not be too concerned if this was an early access game, or if I could find a mod to make pirates stop suicide bombing themselves. As it is, I believe this is the full release (though I'll have to double check after writing this), and no one seems to have cooked up a fix for my major issue.\n\nIt also doesn't help that despite being a full release, most of the actual gameplay mechanics just don't work. I don't just mean the cannons. sometimes your dudes will just decide to path into the ocean, killing themselves, and should you add a second deck to your ship, you can count on everyone starving to death because they can't find the food on the deck below them.\n\nBuy it if you're a casual gamer or if you die often in these types of games and will rarely get to the point described above. Don't buy it if you like games that give you some sense of accomplishment, cause after a while, you will just get frustrated.","August 29, 2014","false","30.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

I can't recommend it based on the performance and UI problems. Toward the end of the game I had stuttering so bad I couldn't even move the camera. This made placing items on your ship even more tedious. The UI also had me frustrated at many points and it was only until later I figured out I could scroll the list of items you can equip on a pirate. SO MUCH CLICKING. An inventory that let you select multiple items would have gone a long way. Buying 10x an item and having to click for each was brutal.\n\nThere needed to be some more automation with the elements that were tedious (placing food, leveling up pirates). It would have been better if their were less weapons but they were more diverse. I was drowning in weapons and just gave up figuring out which ones did what when usually the ones that were already leveled are the best.\n\nThe ship building is fun although extremely pointless. Allowing the player to customize their experience with their own ship and naming of their pirates is what this game did best.\n\nI hate to be so negative because I could see the potential of a game like this but this one fell short.","October 6, 2015","false","20.1"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

Most of the graphics and animations are pixelated, which covers up most of the violence. My children enjoyed hearing the pooping noises the pirates made after eating.\n\nDid I make time to complete it?\n\nThis appears to be a game that doesn’t have a definitive ending (though I may be wrong). I played numerous pirates and “survived” for quite a long time with some of them. The playthroughs were all enjoyable regardless of their length.\n\nRedlight or Greenlight?\n\nThis game is currently at a greenlight.\n\nTo be honest I’ve played some “completed” games that haven’t been this polished or fun.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kryskiller666/recommended/264140/","kryskiller666","BadassFreeman","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kryskiller666/","217 products in account","Got this game for free by one of the devs as a gift, back in xmas when copies of the game were being thrown arround. I have spend 0€'s on this, and because of that, I feel bad for the people who actually bought it. I'll go with the bad stuff first:\n\nThe biggest dissapointment is that the game is unfinished. This is something that I just can't tolerate. You don't sell someone a house without roof, so you should NOT sell an unfinished game. Does the game have the features that the devs promised? No weather system, no sea-monster battles, no hideouts, no bases,you don't get much with a 10€ purchase. You have islands where most of the NPC's (or all of them) are hostile, peaceful islands where you can buy stuff, and ship battles that are bland and repetitive. And that's another thing...\n\nSea battles. They're horse-sh#t. Maybe at the start, they're somewhat okay, you just tell your guys to aboard a little ship, or they board yours... But then later on, they have cannons, you have cannons, and all the fun explodes. Crew members are expensive and take forever to train so they're useful (and training also takes money), but they die easily by the cannons. AND THAT'S ANOTHER THING TOO!\n\nYou only have two commands to give: Either move the captain arround, or move everyone else. That's it. I'm not kidding. Mouse 1 selects a place where your captain can move, and Mouse 2 moves everyone else to that point. You can't, for example, tell someone to stay ready at the cannons, or to stay cooking for everyone else. Your pirates, captain included, will do whatever they feel like. This isn't Sims 2, this is a Pirate Simulator, and let me tell you, PIRATES WERE COORDINATED. If they weren't, THEY WOULDN'T HAVE A CAPTAIN!\n\nI've also managed to find bugs. I mean, it's no surprise, I'm able to find bugs even on my house (the lightning works like sh#t, and the windows barely work, everyone smokes weed, 4/20), but I'm talking about bugs that force you to restart the game (being stuck on the enemy ship, even though you blew it up and can't go back), and even bugs that will force you to restart the game again! (crew members, captain included, suddenly refuse to eat, I managed to find out that boarding another ship and taking it for your own fixes it temporally) And I refuse to think that they haven't found any of these bugs yet. I found them in less than an hour of playing the game.\n\nThat being said, does the game have good stuff? Yeah, there's a lot of potential for a great game, but sadly the Devs left the boat (ironic) to make other games. I remember that in December of 2013, they promised those features to be added. We're in 2015. It's been more than a whole year, and the only thing that was added have been Steam cards and achievements. Oh, and some XMas items. The characters look okay, the voices and soundtrack are decent, the gameplay can be dull at times, but it's fun for a few hours, the graphics are beautiful but lazy (you see the same stuff WAAAAAY too much), the character and world creating is creative, even though it doesn't seem to matter much in the end, there are some good references to other games and movies hidden arround there, though I expected more... And it goes on to infinity.\n\nI can't bring myself to recommend the game. I really want to, because I had fun for a while... But I can't even bring myself to finish it. Why? Because I know it's going to be the same, over again. I defeated one of the 4 "Legendary Captains" without much effort, and the other 3 will surely be the same. There's no story either, so why would I expect an ending? It's probably a screen with text, and maybe some credits. If they EVER finish the game, then I'll play it again, redo the review, and update it, maybe even recommend it. But for now? Spending 10€ on this is a ripoff. Maybe just wait for a sale that drops it arround 1-3€ if you're interested in helping the devs, that's it.","January 24, 2015","false","13.1"," 45 of 86 people (52%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","52","45","86","3","0"

Well, if you thought you could keep them out of combat, (1) they don't listen, (2) they don't share XP from kills from your more seasoned fighters.\n- Morale is broken\n- UI is broken: if I want to eat food, I have to go to the "Shipbuilding" panel... if I want to give my crew a consumable, I have to select them in the crew tab and "equip" a "passive item". You can't even go to a screen where all of your items are visable at once, which leaves you guessing...\n- Poorly implemented tutorial. The fact that you can't pause and view the tutorial properly at the same time tells you all you need to know about this problem.\n- Poor translation\n- No officially sanctioned community or bug reporting\n- You can't save the game at your convenience, even on the non-hardcore setting. This wouldn't be so upsetting if the game didn't have so many game-ending/breaking bugs/features. I'm currently stuck on a save where my Captain has 3 health and is bleeding; aka I die immediately after loading.\n\nThis could have been a great game.

On the way, you can recruit people for your crew (meh, not all that cool), fully customize your ship (SWEET!), and have lots of fun and exploration along the way.\n\nPros:\nGreat plot\nGreat pixelated graphics\nFully customizable ship (THAT'S something you don't see everyday!)\nSlash at chickens for no good reason\nFrom the creators of Terraria\nHave fun in general\nYou're a pirate. Enough said.\n\nCons.\nNot the best animations\nEVERYONE IS SOOOOOOOOO SLOW\nYou have to pay your crew and get them drunk to make sure they won't kill you\nPOOP. MUST BE SWEPT. AT ALL TIMES. That, you you'll be killed.\nCan't do much while at sea (I mean, how hard is it to place a watermelon/biscuts while at sea???)\nChickens can easily own you (I learned this the hard way)\nHonestly expersive for this kind of game\nKinda dumb in general\nBad interface\nHard to control EVERYTHING\nYou're a pirate. Enough said.\n\nBUUUT, other than that, this is a great game. Sure, the creators kinda slipped up on this one, but it's a fine game overall.\nHowever, I highly suggest to not get this game until it's on sale.

I have to make you aware of a couple of performance issues that I am having. Here are my primary computer specs:\n\nWindows 7 64bit\nVisheara 8 core 8350 AMD\n16gb low latency gamer ram\nGeforce 970 gtx\n144hz Dell S2716DG Monitor\n900 watt black edition HE power supply\nCrosshair formula IV motherboard\n\nWith this strong machine I still experience game stopping stuttering and lag after about an hour of play. Shutting the game down and turning it back on seems to work for another stretch of time, but it varies as to when the problem will occur again and it will. This leads me to suspect some sort of memory leak but beyond that I can't speculate.\n\nAside from this unfortunate performace issue, Pixel Piracy is an excellent time killer in which you can sail the high seas, experience elements of survival as you must fend off pirates, eat, drink, and maintain morale lest you suffer from a scurvy dog mutiny...The goal is to sail and plunder as much gold as possible while becoming stronger and propagating your small crack force of pirate boarders who will hopefully become powerful enough to face off against the powerful legendary pirates. Youll only achieve this with the right weaponry and tactics after fighting many battles.\n\nGood luck Captains!

The animation is fun and inviting, and then everything bleeds. The pirates, animals, crates, urns, it's great. The micromanagement of every character makes it that much more fun. I have put a lot more time into this than expected. Wouldn't mind being able to customize the crew appearanc, but finding the cool looking crew members is part of the fun. And having a goofy unibrow guy carry the bomb to blow up when he dies is pretty entertaining too.","February 19","true","41.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

So Austin Tkushaka had one dream and one dream only, to have a decently looking ship and more than 2 crew members.\n\nAustin Tkushaka went to a nearby tavern to get together a crew, and by a crew of course I mean just one person. After about 10 seconds of searching Austin found the perfect person. Austin had the power to somehow name all of his crew members so he called it '*****', I have to bleep the name for security reasons but lets just call him Chang. So Austin and Chang set off like 14 metres and fought off an island, they then decided to up their game and start taking on level one boats.\n\nbuuuuuuutt they wanted another crew member before they started getting extreme, and so Austin and Chang went back to the tavern and got this hippy-looking guy who used to make hats. Because of his hat making, we gave him the very formal nickname 'Fashion ♥♥♥'. So with this new kid on da block, they decided to start taking ships\n\nbuuuuuuutt they wanted to do one more island first. They went to an island right next to the one they just conquered, and on it was a single dark skinned man. Austin, Chang and Fashion ♥♥♥ went off the boat and started beating him up, when he begged for his life and asked if he could join us, Austin said yes. Like I mentioned earlier, Austin had the power to change people’s names, so he called him 'Abbo man'. (By abbo of course Austin means A.B.B.A but it was like a spelling error I swear to god plz no hate).\n\nSo Abbo man joined Austin, Chang and Fashion ♥♥♥ in their quest for decent ship. They then started their boat-taking quest.\n\nThey were successful with their boat-taking, they captured like 2 boats and were successful in their endeavours, UNTILLL they decided to capture a very particular boat. Wait no the boat was normal and boring but it was really particular and special because this is the boat that killed Austin Tkushaka.\n\nSorry give me a moment I’m getting emotional.\n\nSo back to the story, Austin Tkushaka had just died and the crew took over the ship and killed everyone inside. Chang, being the first person Austin had hired, because the new leader of the SS-SWAGAROONY. Now Chang leading the SS-SWAGAROONY was the biggest change the group had experienced ever in the history of life. Chang decided that they wanted to ride in style instead of some scrubby boat, so they tried to take over a level 2 ship and succeeded. Another thing Chang did was add the 3 greatest, well some of the greatest, fighters in SS-SWAGAROONY history. These were 'party man', 'ahghghgggh', and 'rave man'. All of them had equal stats throughout the time they were aboard the SS-SWAGAROONY.\n\nSo now the ship had 6 people on it and was being lead by Chang. With Chang’s help the group was just about ready to get a level 3 ship, when suddenly, Chang died. To be completely honest I forgot how Chang died, but I THINK that it was in a battle on a ship, lets just say that for story purposes.\n\nSo the next person in line for the SS-SWAGAROONY was Fashion ♥♥♥. The first thing Fashion ♥♥♥ did when he got power was get a level 3 ship. Then he decided to fix the fact that there was poop all over the boat. They travelled and they travelled, looking for gold to buy for the 'cleaning' book. After some time, they got the book and Fashion ♥♥♥ learn how to throw poop off the side of the ship, proving his worth as a leader.\n\nFashion ♥♥♥ then continued to change the SS-SWAGAROONY. He added 3 or 4 more people (who turned out to be so useless I don’t remember their names) to the ship and he trained everybody. Another thing he did was stock up on food. And by stock up i mean 90% of the ship floors would be some type of food. He also got this really cool level 4 ship.\n\nBut Fashion ♥♥♥ had one flaw which would make him the worst leader in SS-SWAGAROONY history, he was like two times slower than everyone else in the game. So like when we went to take over a ship, when they were done he would finally get onto the ship. Now this was the biggest issue on the SS-SWAGAROONY at the moment, so Fashion ♥♥♥ decided to fix it before it was too late. Fashion ♥♥♥ looked far and wide for a solution too his slowness, and in a level 3 town he found it, a book which change his walking speed by 10%. Buuuut he had already spent all his money on food so Fashion ♥♥♥ needed a solution\n\nTL;DR: he started destroying boats and then sold all his weapons and had around 5 thousand dollars. he then got the book but it make like no difference\n\nThis is where things started going bad, right at this moment. See Fashion ♥♥♥ needed to spend all this money somehow, so he looked for a level 4 towns and never found one, but instead started seeing vikings and level 5 ships. He did not encounter many, and so far Fashion ♥♥♥ had only had to see the other 2 leaders die, he wasn’t going to let anybody die on the SS-SWAGAROONY.\n\nFashion ♥♥♥ then stumbled across a town that sold boat items, and he got this thing called a captains seat. This is where things got worse. After this seat we still had around 3-4 thousand dollars left, so we sailed back to a level 2 towns in search for a tavern. And we found a tavern, and we got 3 new people. One, which is quite important, Shrek. Now I’m not saying this as a joke, the other 2 names were serious names and this one had a green shirt so fashion ♥♥♥ called him Shrek. But this person is very important.\n\nAfter these 3 new people things became...strange. And tbh the captains seat didn’t really do anything. But ah yes, this is when things became dodgy. The first sign on dodgyness was Fashion ♥♥♥ was becoming very depressed, and depended to be paid every 10 seconds or we would probably kill someone. But one day he didn’t get payed and just....snapped.\n\nRight after we destroyed a level 4 ship. He turned on everyone in the ship, and they were forced to fight back. Rave man then soon followed Fashion man, snapping and turning on everybody.\n\nGetting emotional again give me a minute.\n\nSo they were 2 men down, and the beloved Fashion ♥♥♥ had finally died. Of course though, the next person in line was Abbo man, and he wanted change in the ship and no more incidents like this.\n\nOf course, the best solution was to buy 4 more irrelevant people and see what would happen, and guess what happened... well at this point nothing happened but were getting there.\n\nSo Abbo man wanted to take over a ship because he just spent all of Fashion ♥♥♥♥ money. Everybody went onto the ship, Abbo man, party man, aghaghagh, Shrek, and everyone else that was still alive. They killed everybody in the ship then, it happened again, somebody turned.\n\nAnd guess who that somebody was. Abbo man. Abbo man turned on everybody, and then it lead to total disaster. Everybody turned, and there was only one person who was left in the end. Shrek\n\nWho was actually bleeding and died of blood loss 10 seconds after. The end.\n\n*All of this actually happened in Pixel Piracy.\n** I was emotionally attached to almost every character in my ship\n*** I am now emotionally unstable\n\n'Do you recommend this game'?\nWell, I love the character part of things and the ships and battles and stuff. But its extremely glitchy for a full release, especially when there is lots of people on your boat. Another thing that started to happen was only the captain could move on the boat and everyone would start starving until I moved places\n\nAnd of course, the moral of this story is that money is bad.","April 24, 2015","true","13.2"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","67","4","6","5","1"

It's not what I expected at all (even after reading about it a little and watching the trailer) but I was pleasantly surprised. The only reason I bought this was because it was made by Re Logic, creators of Terraria (as well as another group I haven't heard of and forgot the name of) and I had a 25% off coupon (2 in fact). I was immediately taken by the menu screen's music and small visuals in the backdrop of palm trees swaying at an angle. I created my world and was off.\nMoving was confusing at first because I assumed W-A-S-D would work but instead I had to click. I caught on quickly and bought crew members and food (and accidently attacked shopkeeper). Then I made my ship, had to watch a video to learn how to sail, and began my grand adventure.\nWell, that particular exploration was a bust, because I saved when docking at a town with my captain at 3% morale and did not have the funds to pay him, so he kept losing morale and the game was over when it was out. This part may seem confusing now, but you will soon learn what this all means when you take the first step into the world.\n\n\n......Ready for adventure?","May 11, 2014","true","10.0"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

However that feeling quickly fades away after the first couple of hours. The gameplay is very shallow - you go from location to location either fighting others on ships or on islands. Rinse and repeat until you farm up enough experience to take on higher levels and gold to purchase a larger crew and additional items. There are no quests or missions here, just a giant map open for you to wander aimlessly until you can defeat the 4 legendary pirates in each corner of the map. Not only does going from location to location and repeating the same commands gets boring very fast there are bugs that constantly come up (ex. crew members randomly decide not to get off the ship anymore). The game is fine if you're OK doing the same thing over and over and can deal with the game issues/bugs, but to me it's just not fun and quite boring. This game would actually be somewhat decent if it was a mobile type of game.","April 1","false","4.4"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

While I loved the concept and the gameplay, the dealbreaker for me was the bugs. They tried my patience until I finally just got tired of playing.\n\nThough I encountered several bugs, the one that was extremely frequent, irritating, and ultimately made me quit playing was when you order your crew or captain to disembark onto an island they frequently get stuck near the edge of the island. When this happens to your captain, you cannot progress, forcing you to reload the game to the last save. When it happens to your crew members (sometimes multiple crewman at a time) the only way I found I could get them unstuck was to issue an order to send them back to the ship...at which point they promptly dove into the ocean and drowned (unless they had the swimming perk). Thus, you are forced to either reload the last save or accept the loss of crew members you may have spent a long time leveling up and upgrading.\n\nIf this happened occasionally I could have overlooked it, but I was finding myself reloading my game and replaying the same island encounter over and over again until I just happened to be lucky enough not to have any of my crew get stuck. Then I would go to another island and start the process all over again.\n\nBottom line, I really enjoyed the game when I wasn't dealing with bugs, but the bugs just became too much of a burden and caused more frustration than the game is worth.","April 19","false","13.5"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","5","8","0","0"

I was wrong, most of the time you have to sail on ship. Game has three places at maximum which by the way causes to get boring quite fast. Island battles, ship boarding battles and visit other towns, all island are and will be same size does not matter where you travel. If you have hired more than 2 pirates you can not controll them separately only captain, all other crew members will be controlled with RMB.\nUgly in game's interface, selecting any item from list will reset your list back to top, which is very annoying.\n\nGame fails to explain how many skills particular crew member can have, also some skills just stopped to level up for some reason, i dunno, if it is intended or bug.\n\nAnd last but not least, apperantly devs have abandoned Pixel Piracy for good, so there is no point to buy it, because lets face it game is not finished.\n\nFor more info look at this review!","December 4, 2014","false","12.0"," 10 of 18 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","10","18","0","5"

I bought it, because it seemed like a great game, and the fact that it was early access just meant that it would be added to above this to me, so I downloaded it.\n\nUpon launch, crash. Well, okay then, I suppose it's early access.\nLaunch again, play for a bit. To be honest I would have prefered it crash again. You don't have any freedom to create a ship, it's like being told to build big ben and being given half a bucket of lego bricks.\n\nAs far as actually playing goes, it was about as balanced as the ocean we were sailing on. I would either painfully slowly watch as I got a tiny bit of income after paying my crew and buying essential supplies, because the gameplay just does not pay up. The fighting is pretty much just throw all your crew at the other ship, if you have more crew, you might well win. If not, then you're going to come out of that fight dead or with less crew, and at that point, it's going to take a while to get another crew member.\n\nAnd that's just the ship fights, you so much as set foot on an island and the locals will maul you to death. And then I see that there are 'epics' floating around in the open waters. Packed full of crew. And cannons. Yeah! there are cannons. Good luck ever finding out how the hell you can get them on your ship, never played long enough.\n\nOh and then it crashed.

Granted, the first 3-4 times I had trouble surviving and making it as a scurvy seadog. But then I figured out the game and then everything was a breeze to progress from early game to mid and late game. That is also a downside with the game, a lack of any kind of useful tutorial, you just have to read and read alot of text in a help screen (which to me screams the devs just wanted this game out, at whatever quality).\n\nThe second thing that strikes me is the horrible control scheme and GUI. You can only really precision control your own unit (the captain) and everyone else does their best to do what you tell them. Some commands are "drag" commands and some are "action" commands and I don't see a reason why the control of your crew should be this bad. When you order your crew to move, all run as fast as possible to that spot, meaning the fastest guy gets there first, but might not engage the enemy first cause they engage in wierd ways. The control of the crew and pets is aweful, have not been thought out and when boarding ships with a crew, some can fall into the water directly killing them or makes them unavaiable for a time if you're lucky. Another minor gripe is the constant is the constant nagging if you want to "save", and you can just tell it to not ask you in the next 10 minutes, but then you can't save in over 10 minutes which is real bad.\n\nYour crew can be trained in skills aswell as your captain, like fishing (which is useful as it gives you free food), and cooking (to coock the free fish). This system is extremely flawed and if you would like to have a crew that can both catch & cook fish and clean, they will be almost useless. This is because fishing takes a bit of time, and while the rod is out in the water, the desire to clean (tossing poo overboard, fitting description later on?) comes on and ABORTS the fishing. So  a sole crewman with the fishing skill is required to catch alot of fish. This could be okay if not for items on your ship disrupt your crew in the same manner. Yes, items on your ship like playing cards, sword practice or reading books stops your crew randomly from doing what they can, just to give them some morale or more Training points. It's flawed once again, you can work around the broken mechanics, but what's the point if you can't play the game as you want?\n\nI have many more gripes about this game and I just think this game becomes an utter disappointment at the end. I like to make my captain a strong soldier alone in my second playthrough to have control and it was a breeze to clear ship after ship with just him. even the bosses. And getting there was soo boring and repetitive. The potential for what could have been is huge!!! But this is just a skeleton with no added meat or flavor to it, it is just not a good game i'm sad to say. I just can't recommend this game to my friends because then I would be ashamed and they would hate it, it just isn't worth any more time.\n\nPros:\n+ Nice pixelart\n+ Good character customization, differnet voices and looks\n+ Build your own ship, sail the seas (in the start)\n\nCons:\n- Slow paced. Going on land is slow and tedious and have to wait minutes to get any buisness done. More fun if paced more correctly with the actual content.\n- Sailing. a core mechanic is "sail-time". You see your boat travel and you crew working, but is really a boring wait screen\n- Random Generator. yeah, it works, but it doesn't tell what the worldcreator options really do and can make maps really hard or really easy\n- Crew control. You really can't control them, commands are clunky and don't work as advertiesed.\n- Crew. Don't see a reason for them unless they fish for you.\n- Skills and Items. Both of them interupts other skills and jobs, making having both not an option.\n- Lack of variation. both in what you explore, music and combat.\n- Difficulty. Only challanging in the beginning, then a grindfest begins, then you can kill the bosses.\n- GUI. Some icons you drag, some buttons you click, some commands don't work and no control over individuals.\n- Boarding. Sometimes your crew could board the enemy just to fall off and die. You can board outside of the boarding phase.\n\n\nThere are probably more problems that I've forcefully pushed out of my memory. But this is not a well-made, polished game. But a broken mess of great potential. This game falls short and would get a 3/10 if I would grade it.","December 27, 2014","false","22.8"," 27 of 52 people (52%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","52","27","52","2","0"

I'm only 3.7 hours into the game so far, and I still have so much more to do. This inde game has LOADS of content for it's price. The game, however, is extremely difficult for begginers. I tried to play on normal, but I couldn't so I reset to easy. In easy mode, it still is possible to lose if you haven't developped any strategies. I reccomend buying the cleaning trait, the fishing trait and cooking trait early on in the game, and not focusing too much on hiring. Oh yeah, and if you have a lot of pirates, they talk way too much and it gets annoying.There are so many aspects in this game, and it is extremely fun to try and balance all of it's challenges at once.

The damn thing is supposed to be out of early access and yet, it is one of the most unpolished games I've ever played. Also, the store page is missleading at best.  A game will take you about 10 hours to get through, and by the end it is a mindless grind.  Screw the claim of multiple full game playthroughs, you'd probably die of bordem.  The so-called 'open world' is only mildly accurate as it is just a collection of the same three things over and over (island encounters, ship encounters, and stores).  Also, the idea of having a large crew is completly absurd with the current hunger and morale system.  On the easiest difficulty, it is nigh impossible to support a crew of more than 5.  Actually, this game really is one broken system after another.","August 8, 2014","false","23.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I bought this game on a whim during the 'full release' sale. Reading reviews it seemed like all the top were positive, calling it the 'pirate FTL,' but even with the short time I've put into it, it fails at capturing that. It feels like a beta, and I believe it still should be considered a beta. Interesting how a couple days after release now all the top reviews for it are negative. It honestly feels like a big flash game from some free game website thanks to the amateurish level of polish when it comes to the menus and fonts. I realize I haven't put much time into the game, but at this point I don't care to put any more. Perhaps in a few months with some big updates the game will be worth playing to me, but right now it isn't.

It IS however horribly buggy, and frustrating when you realise this is no longer in early release. Those looking for a finished game, should wait. This game at it's best can be qutie a bit of fun managing your team and sailing the seven seas, however with the lack of control the player has over prioritys your team will quickly devolve into grabbing a chunk of Sh*t while trying to train swords, all the while starving to death. The game is a really cool concept, and when it works, theres fun to be had, but crew members floating in front of ships while attempting to fish, and suicidal AI really will ruin the experience.

Most of all it would be nice to be able to assign each command to a key (plunder, interact etc.) as clicking across the screen is a bit more fiddly with the setup I have and the UI presented.

It looked like Re-logic just repeated Terraria all over again, but with more of an RPG aspect this time. That was not the case. Sure the game is made of pixels, but if you look closely, it's a beautiful world that runs smoothly. You can hire your own crew, discover lost treasure, make your own ship (Look at my screenshots for examples) and so much more.

It's a fun 8-bit styled game that has pretty good replayability in it, as well as the option to play on Hardcore mode, or an Arena mode.\n\nYou can level up and customize your own stats for each of your pirate crew members, as well as equipping ranged and melee weapons. (Passive too, mostly used for healing and little buffs.) The game itself is pretty simple once you understand the mechanics, build a ship, explore around islands or battle other pirates/people in other ships and build your own crew of pirates to commandeer.\n\nIf I'd have to give any issues I have with it currently, it's that the voices in it can get annoying at times, from having to hear your pirate and crew randomly yell out gibberish, especially when you're in a tavern FILLED with other pirates. The graphic options could use more work too, so far it's just Unity launcher settings with a normal and normal/vsync option.\n\nOverall though, and being that it's in alpha currently, it's a pretty good buy if you're into roguelike games, and hopefully, they'll improve it much more as time goes on.","March 31, 2014","true","2.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","3"

If you don't care so much for them though, feel free to send them off onto an enemy ship or to battle a group of native tribesmen on an island then go clean up the mess when they're gone, and pick up their spare cash.

I highly reccomend that you pick up this game if you are willing to put up with the few bugs or odd happenings that are still occuring (since it is still in development) and it is well worth the money if you like these 'hardcore' or 'roguelike' games.","April 9, 2014","true","9.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

However, it still has a lot of work to undergo but at least the development team went back to this project to bring it up to par with the goals and standards they set out for in the beginning.\n\nYou play as a pirate of your creation on a quest to kill four legendary pirates. It has a big map, a ship-creation tool, a bounty board, and an array of enemies and little details lacking in prior versions. Not for everyone but if you enjoy pixel graphics and being a pirate, this game is for you! So help support this three-man team and get this game because it is still better than other games like Godus and Castle Story; which have been completely abandoned, so disregard any review older than 2015 on this game if you want a more complete view of what this game will accomplish.","May 29, 2015","true","5.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I'm only 3.7 hours into the game so far, and I still have so much more to do. This inde game has LOADS of content for it's price. The game, however, is extremely difficult for begginers. I tried to play on normal, but I couldn't so I reset to easy. In easy mode, it still is possible to lose if you haven't developped any strategies. I reccomend buying the cleaning trait, the fishing trait and cooking trait early on in the game, and not focusing too much on hiring. Oh yeah, and if you have a lot of pirates, they talk way too much and it gets annoying.There are so many aspects in this game, and it is extremely fun to try and balance all of it's challenges at once. I highly reccomend this game for people who like a challenge, like rogue-like games, task based games, or just don't have a good enough computer to buy expensive games.\n\n- Takes a while to get the hang of it\n-  Frustrating moments\n-Annoying pirates\n\n+Pirates can be cute ;)\n+ Great action and adventure\n+Beautifull game\n+It's a challenge\n+Extremely fun once you get the hang of it.\n+Lots of content\n+Cheap price\n\nIt's not the best game ever, but I am having TONS of fun, so I'll give it a 9/10\n\n*Try to get this game on sale for extreme satisfaction!!","June 27, 2014","true","6.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This is 80% on that track. It's very playable and fun at it's current state, I have already played 12+ hours and only have faught Level 10 Pirate Ships. It has a bunch or Islands and Pirate ships to explore and BOARD/fight. I emphasize BOARD for a reason. There is a cannon Trait, which is either too weak to really do any damage, or your lazy ♥♥♥ pirate crew just won't use. This leads me to the only real negative with this game, you get these books that teach your crew to do certain things, fight better, earn more TP, clean, learn to poop, use the cannon etc. Well even when learned, your crew just sometimes doesn't bother to do anything but drink rum and drop a boat. I found this to be more true when my pirate ship was large with a rather large size crew. So far thats the only real negative I've found in this game, which hurts a little but not enough to ruin it.\n\nSome features I would like to see implemented:\n\n- Auto Upgrade your crew. Having a large crew and each with TP to use can take some time to upgrade each one.\n\n- The traits above must be fixed to take this game to the next level, if a crew member cleans poop, I EXPECT him to clean poop when it's lying all over my ship!\n\n- Add more style's to the game, ie diff islands, ships that look dramatically diff. Add more unique ships.\n\n- If my crew is standing next to a toliet or food he should poop in the toliet or eat the food.

It's a fun 8-bit styled game that has pretty good replayability in it, as well as the option to play on Hardcore mode, or an Arena mode.\n\nYou can level up and customize your own stats for each of your pirate crew members, as well as equipping ranged and melee weapons. (Passive too, mostly used for healing and little buffs.) The game itself is pretty simple once you understand the mechanics, build a ship, explore around islands or battle other pirates/people in other ships and build your own crew of pirates to commandeer.\n\nIf I'd have to give any issues I have with it currently, it's that the voices in it can get annoying at times, from having to hear your pirate and crew randomly yell out gibberish, especially when you're in a tavern FILLED with other pirates. The graphic options could use more work too, so far it's just Unity launcher settings with a normal and normal/vsync option.\n\nOverall though, and being that it's in alpha currently, it's a pretty good buy if you're into roguelike games, and hopefully, they'll improve it much more as time goes on.","March 31, 2014","true","2.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","3"

However, it still has a lot of work to undergo but at least the development team went back to this project to bring it up to par with the goals and standards they set out for in the beginning.\n\nYou play as a pirate of your creation on a quest to kill four legendary pirates. It has a big map, a ship-creation tool, a bounty board, and an array of enemies and little details lacking in prior versions. Not for everyone but if you enjoy pixel graphics and being a pirate, this game is for you! So help support this three-man team and get this game because it is still better than other games like Godus and Castle Story; which have been completely abandoned, so disregard any review older than 2015 on this game if you want a more complete view of what this game will accomplish.","May 29, 2015","true","5.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

And I would swear that intro sfx when you first start the game is a dev's idea of a jump-scare joke.\n\nYou spend more time micromanaging cleaning up poop and feeding your crew than the exciting parts of sailing and fighting.  Everything is more or less a passive experience.\n\nPoop jokes get old when it's ubiquitous and poop never stops in this game.\n\nThere isn't enough variety in the encounters to make sailing not feel repetitive.  You meet different sprites and environments to interact with, but each interaction is more or less the same.\n\nPro:\n\nGood music.  Not great music, but good music.\n\nThere's enough item, perk, and equipment variety to keep you interested.\n\nLeveling and RPG elements for customization of pirates and your ship.\n\nThere's some suspense in making sure you have enough food and funds to keep your characters happy and alive.\n\nYou can play it windowed as you do something else, like listening to audiobooks or watching youtube videos.\n\n________________________________________________________________________________\n\nConclusion:  For a couple bucks it's fine.

It shows what seems like open ended, tile-by-tile modular ship building, and then artillery gameplay similar to Worms between these ships, with a hint of Dwarf Fortress thrown in for good measure. I was instantly won over. The reality is, while there is tile-by-tile ship building, it's in practice purely cosmetical. It doesn't affect gameplay in any way. In fact, there is no strategy or tactics to speak of regarding much of anything you do in Pixel Pirates. It goes like this:\n1 - You select an "encounter" on the map - whose "level" is conveniently visible to you.\n2 - Your pirates sail to it and then go over and whack the hopelessly outmatched occupants of the ship/island/whatever. And if they aren't hopelessly outmatched, there isn't anything you can do to turn the tides either, the only orders you can give are to either fight or retreat; go select lower encounters instead.\n3 - If your pirates leveled up, decide which attribute to raise. Doesn't make much of a difference, just accept that they now can whack tougher stuff\n4 - If food is low, restock\n5 - If there's excess cash, buy more pirates so you can whack tougher stuff\n5 - Rinse and repeat.\n\nThere's no depth whatsoever to anything. Promises of procedural generation? Well, it's procedurally generated in the same sense that Minefield for Windows is procedurally generated. Nothing interesting ever happens. Nothing actually requiring your input ever happens.","August 2, 2014","false","4.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I repeat CAN NOT, scroll through them in any way, any pieces lower then 20 are completely inaccessible for there is no scroll or down arrow to get to them.... hope they weren't too important....\n\nThe tips/guide is simply terrible, not a huge deal because it's a relatively simple game. but the hints seemed to get stuck because I did a tutorial thing before it told me, I then couldn't do it and the text seemed to stay on the screen until i turned it off.\n\nThere are certain things that aren't well explained.\nFor one, the stats. I apparently have over 100% chance to hit, if that's the case why can I go take a ♥♥♥♥ (in real life) while my pirate and the enemy pirate are just trading "misses" for nearly 5 minutes straight (not even an exaggeration)\n\nThis honestly isn't even a big deal if the mechanics were explained like "well it's your dextarity matched against enemies "agility" or something like that, which is what I have to assume but will never know I guess.\n\nas for the second problem with stats VITALITY seems completely useless "health regen" is all it seems to do. which would be COOL if it actually worked in combat. it doesn't... so it's one of those stats you throw a couple points into and never touch again because there are better ways to heal on your ship like a crew member with "doctor aura"\n\nFurthermore,\nThe weapons level up with use, simple satisfying mechanic. the only thing is... the ranged weapons don't... you can find grindstones in the game that give you a chance to level a weapon (seperate for ranged and melee) and the higher the level the less chance it is to upgrade, you literally cannot level ranged weapons to max in ANY way. another very simple pathetic flaw about the game, should have been fixed on day one. actual bugs aside, there is no viable way to make ranged pirates, so if you wanted to be a pistol wielding pirate look elsewhere, the pistols cooldown is way too long to be viable and the pirates will just face rush the enemy like every other character in the game, all characters are MELEE in this game.\n\nYou gain notoriety by doing bounties. what this does, I don't know. it seems like logically it should make it less likely to be interupted by other pirate encounters while sailing but it doesn't seem to be the case. that would be great because sometimes you want to sail somewhere far without it taking 20 minutes because your interrupted 2-3 times.\n\nSome weapons can level to 100. logically you would think that these weapons would start a bit worse but end up being 15-20% then weapons that level to 50... this doesn't seem to be the case with weapons I have tested. it also takes FOR-EV-VER to level a 100 weapon, basically you can do a single one in a playthrough.\noverall weapon design and balance seems poor. lategame all that really seems to matter is attack speed.\n\nvariety after playing a bit seems very poor. It's really just the same formula over and over, with bigger numbers the further from the middle of the map you get. This leads you to not really want to explore but to rush from boss to boss, stopping only to sell junk, repair your ship, and leveling if you have to gain some power (which is interesting in itself because it seems like once you can kill one boss you can just kill the others with ease because from what I've experienced they are all basically the same exact encounter)\n\nWhere are unique monster islands?\nmaybe an island instead of having pirates it has a giant cyclops with unique loot.\nMaybe a kraken could attack your ship while sailing, for a uniqe encounter.\njust a couple ideas, this game sorely lacks stuff like this.\n\nThe game is very simple, very repetive, but if you like grindy loot games you can definately have a bit of fun with it, but OVERALL this game feels very unfinished to me and currently I can't recommend it at ten dollars. In it's current state, if it's on sale for a couple bucks it might be a fun time waster but highly advise not getting it until it's dirt cheap or fixed.\n\nAlso if you do buy it (again hopefully not for more then a couple bucks) do yourself a favor and just play hard mode your first time. It will require 5-6 extra islands and ships to grind early game then make no difference whatsoever after that. so you might as well pick hard because once you beat this it's unlikely you will want to play it again. Now you can atleast say you beat it on the highest difficulty.","February 12","false","26.0"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

I took a chance on Pixel Piracy, and in my opinion it's worth every penny right now as an alpha, that many games can't compare to as finished products! It's challenging, fun, open world, and something different everytime.\n\nI have encounters a few bugs, but nothing restarting the game hasn't gotten rid of so far.\n\nYou will die often, but instead of this being frustrating, I tend to enjoy starting a new file from the beginning again, because it's always random.\n\nI...

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/skel1/recommended/264140/","skel1","Skel1","http://steamcommunity.com/id/skel1/","526 products in account","New Review:\n\nIt is sad to see how far this game has come in terms of being a steaming pile of poo. While minor tweaks have been made to the games user interface, the majority of work has been put towards useless graphics filters like bloom and depth of field (seriously guys?). The code in this game is so bad that even with all of the fancy graphics options turned off my GPU's fans start whirring at full speed and my computer sounds like it's going to reach five million degrees and create a black hole in the universe.\n\nPerformance on this game is TERRIBLE. The user interface is still mind boggling terrible, and the game balance has actually gotten WORSE over time. With each iteration it becomes less and less of a survival game, and more and more of.... I don't even know what to call it.\n\nWhere as I used to recommend this game in my old review, I am no longer recommending it. This is the first time I think I've ever seen a game actually get worse over time. It used to be worth a few bucks while on sale, but I can no longer say that about pixel piracy in its current state. It's hard to pinpoint the exact reasons why, but where I used to see innovation and potential, now I see bandaids and sideshows.\n\nOld Review:\n\nDespite its (serious) flaws, it's still not a bad buy.\n\nThis game has incredible potential but is rendered nearly unplayable by bugs and "features". The UI is poorly done and controls very clunky. There is a very long list of these bugs on the steam forums.\n\nWhat follows is what I shared on the steam forums, but wraps up my sentiment on this game nicely.\n\nThis game is so awesome, but is too buggy to actually play it through\nConsistently, every single time, SOMETHING wigs out that causes something to happen that results in me needing to start a new game. One of them (bleeding to death) is a feature that kinda puts icing on the cake.\n\nBiggest culprit for me is pathfinding but it is not listed in the stickied post. Towards mid game when you need a larger ship to shield from cannon fire, pathfinding on the ship starts wigging out hardcore. People start floating over rum, getting off ladders at the wrong places, and it gets progressively worse till everyone (including the captain) is stuck.\n\nThe other thing that gets me that I didn't see listed is that there is no way to prioritize tasks. My Captain prioritized fixing the hull while at port of an island OVER EATING and starved to death as I was powerless to do anything. Trying to sail away from the island was no good because he'd just starve before I got him to a tavern.\n\nLike, this game is awesome. Seriously. But it's unbalanced and so buggy. When I first bought it I do not remember seeing a preview version warning or anything like other green light games? Such a work of art mired down by bugs!","August 11, 2014","false","89.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Kept me addicted for just hours and hours and I would like all of you to know that all the haters are just people who dislike micro-managment and are people who don't even try to love it. Before I start this reveiw I would like to summarize this game. Pixel Piracy is a Pixel-Based, RPG, Sandbox, Piracy, Micro-management game about living life as a pirate. Your main story objective is to kill four legendary pirates in order to call yourself a true pirate legend. Since this game is a sandbox you have control on what to do and when to do it. You can either raid a ship to keep it or build your own. Your ship can float on water or... FLY!!! Seriously you can make flying boats in the version I am in so :D. You can also hire your own crew and my crew so far is too much to count. And there is depth to the game. There are many islands you can go and raid and I found an island with a hobo on it. I killed him of course but what I am trying to say is that the islands are cool. There are also the pirates that you can pillage. As of what I found you have 3 types of pirates. The Chinese, Republicans, and Pirates and they all have special loot according to their type. My favorite to pillage is the Chinese just because of the OP weapons they have. Also the towns are part of the game. They are little islands with NPC's that own shops to sell you items like ship blocks for your ship, taverns to hire pirates, item shops to buy books to teach your pirates to clean poop, fix your ship, and etc. I just love this game and what it is is very uniqe compared to other micro-management games. Now for the review. I rate the ship-builing 10/10. I rate the depth 8/10. I rate the gameplay 9/10. and I rate the game 9001/10. Thanks for reading this review and what you have read is trueley what the game is.","June 7, 2015","true","28.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's a good game for its kind and it allows the player to be creative. If you like Terraria, then you'll (most likely) like this one. The main thing that makes this game "completed" is the food and morale managing and the little tweaks and bonuses that will help you progress even further. (when morale goes too low, your crew members start attacking each other). You also get to "manage" your crew, level up stats and change weapons and passive items (RPG style).

I have an intimate knowledge as to why my sailors refer to it as a "poop deck". I've seen said poop flung over the side of the ship and against the walls of the ship. I've seen sailors die for no apparant reason and had hp drain for no reason as well. The game itself needs a few tweeks; like an event log, mouseover tooltips, full icons/desc for status effects both positive and negative, typos fixed in pirate descriptions, logical skill assessment (a diver that can't swim, derp), ***A fix for crew randomly turning into aggro enemies and being attacked/killed***, captain starting skill (sailing, cooking, fishing... something guys), an easier way to grab chickens/animals without attacking ALL of them and if you're going to have names like Loraine and Mandy it's okay to have a "She" in there they're not all men and that's okay, lol.\n\nSo, for the TL;DR types it's frustrating the way this game screws up and lacks tutorials for many things. I had cannons on my ship I stole off of some Imperials but could never get them to fire or my guys to actually go to the guns even though they were assigned to gunner jobs and weren't lazy. All of that being said it's ridiculously fun and going to be great when the developers get to these few bugs so I definitely recommend picking it up and flinging some poo around while sailing.\n\nPS: If they do not add some of those things, like the tooltips, recent event/activity log and bug fix for random death I can't promise that'll stay the case as those are the most frustrating things about the game to date, for me. For now I'll just call these flaws "Bugbeard" and hope the scourge is brought to the end of a plank sooner than later.","April 21, 2015","true","26.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","2"

Runs smooth with little bugs. Its a fast paced game with not to much time for you to learn how to play in the start so it can be very frustrating until you learn the game better.\n\nThe only problem is the morale system is poorly designed, causeing your pirates morale to drop so fast at times there is nothing you can do. Also it causes you to rush through the game because of it. Hopefully the developers get to fixing this HUGE issue soon but they seem to want to ignore the problem\n\n**Update: Morale system fixed**","January 1, 2014","true","4.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Pirates after doing a few poop scoops will forget they clean or simply not bother, but they don't mind dumping on the boat, that they still remember.

Example: it's not enough to buy fruit to keep your crew from getting scurvy, you also have to place the food out for your crew to eat, and you have to do this frequently. Then, you have to ensure the resulting bowel movements your crew takes all over the ship get cleaned up, else your morale will plummet.\n\n- It lacks replayability/gets tedious. Encounters quickly start feeling samey once you become strong enough to fight top-tier ships, and islands are nothing more than small platforms that hold stores, or a group of hostile creatures. Your crew and your ship are deeply customizable, but the world around you feels very limited. A shame.\n\n- It feels unfinished. You can take animals as pets, only some of which can actually level up. If your ship becomes unfit to sail (say, because ONE BLOCK cannot be reached by your crew) you are kept from sailing, and are not told what part of your ship is the problem.\n\n-The AI is kinda bad. Example: you better hope the crewman you've assigned to fish knows how to swim, because he'll sit at the front edge of your ship and get blasted into the water while you engage an enemy vessel.\n\nAll in all a fun game to play for a few days, assuming you like pirate games (who doesn't?) and games with roguelike elements.","October 2, 2015","true","42.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Example: it's not enough to buy fruit to keep your crew from getting scurvy, you also have to place the food out for your crew to eat, and you have to do this frequently. Then, you have to ensure the resulting bowel movements your crew takes all over the ship get cleaned up, else your morale will plummet.\n\n- It lacks replayability/gets tedious. Encounters quickly start feeling samey once you become strong enough to fight top-tier ships, and islands are nothing more than small platforms that hold stores, or a group of hostile creatures. Your crew and your ship are deeply customizable, but the world around you feels very limited. A shame.\n\n- It feels unfinished. You can take animals as pets, only some of which can actually level up. If your ship becomes unfit to sail (say, because ONE BLOCK cannot be reached by your crew) you are kept from sailing, and are not told what part of your ship is the problem.\n\n-The AI is kinda bad. Example: you better hope the crewman you've assigned to fish knows how to swim, because he'll sit at the front edge of your ship and get blasted into the water while you engage an enemy vessel.\n\nAll in all a fun game to play for a few days, assuming you like pirate games (who doesn't?) and games with roguelike elements.","October 2, 2015","true","42.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It's nearly almost the same thing over and over again, and you die plus starve a bit too quick. Don't get me wrong, if you play your cards right and get lucky, you could have a great game here, but at the same time, which is most likely, the chance of rivalry and starvation is quite too high. I do however love the games items, the adventure, and I would say that the game is worth the money, most deffinately! The Pro's are in much more number than the cons, and just writing this makes me wanna play it again. I never ran into a Pirate, and not only pirate, but a pixel one before, making this game unique and extremely rare. But as I said, play your cards right, and tread carefully, and you could enjoy this game to its max potential.

It's very playable in version 0.50. It has many features you'd expect out of pirates, cannon battles, boarding, capturing prisoners, and it even has humor.  Individual pirates have little biographies just like in dwarf fortress to make them all the more special. The game feels like a gem. I only have some distaste with controlling your crew as it feels disorganized when you try to mark things to kill or move your crew around to battle.","March 12, 2014","true","23.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Still lots of game breaking bugs.\n\n-Bugs wouldn't be so bad if you could go back and load a save from a previous point before you experienced the bug, but you only have one save and the autosave is so aggressive you will end up with a save at a point where your game is ruined by a bug.\n\n-The settings menu is very difficult to use.  A slider bar for boolean values?\n\n-Bugs include:\n--Crew will refuse to eat prepared food.\n--Crew becomes unhappy because they won't eat prepared food.  You try to move food around and rebuild ship, but by that time they are too unhappy to do anything.  So they won't get back on the boat and eat the food, so they essentially refuse to do the one thing that will solve their hunger issue which made them unhappy in the first place.  So on top of that you have to spend a bunch of gold to get them back on the boat.  This cycle of refusing to eat, unhappeness, and then having to  make them happy the most expensive way leaves me with no gold and eventually they all turn on each other.\n--Can't remap some of the keys so if you are a left handed mouser and move your keys to the right side of the keyboard, you can't remap the 1-6 keys for selecting crew groups which you will find yourself using often.\n--Crew becomes unhappy very very fast.  So much for being a hardy bunch willing to tough out the hard times for the rewards that await them.  If Sir Francis Drake had a crew such as this, he wouldn't have faired well.","August 11, 2014","false","23.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

There are several types of enemies, but there's no difference (I could see, at least) in each one's play style. Since there are 4 bosses and you can pretty much beat the game before the first, the last 75% of the game is just repetitively navigating around a square map to the four corners to beat the "legendary pirates".\n\nThis game would be a looooooot better if there was more variability and the bosses weren't all all the same level, but rather you fought each one in a row and each was harder than the last.

At first I thought the game was far to much random chaos, such as when nothing is happening and my crew will walk off the ship or at times my ship will just glitch and pieces will be moved or just vanish. Considering that pirates can't swim I'd like to see something capable of stopping them from running into the sea like they have a suicide pact with the kraken. Even after placing ladders along all the edges they'll still walk off or jump off and drown. At first I thought the game was to hard thanks to the random chaos, but I found that the real balancing issue is that you don't even have to fight at all to level up. You can literally just sail between two locations and level up and live by fishing and cooking while drinking at a tavern. No effort required at all, my captain was level 75 before I even got into a fight. He was so overpowered he was a demigod among pirates, this takes all challenge and sense of achievement out knowing that you can abuse it so easily with every pirate in your crew. It's so broken that I took out a legendary enemy with a raft and 3 pirates. And the fact that you can save scum (which is almost required if you're not using the sailing abuse method) to get the perfect island or settlement is terrible, it's a glaring reminder that the game is unbalanced, the save scumming is almost on XCOM's level. This game is a fantastic concept that I would really love to see improved upon. Before adding content I would suggest finding a better balance for this game. It's either to hard with all the chaos such as the enemy shooting their own ship with their own cannons and killing everyone (Seriously a suicide pact with the kraken), or boars ramming everyone off the island. Or you just sail to your hearts content and transform your pirates into demigods and never deal with any challenge or danger aside from the enemy sinking their own ship with you on it. Fine tuning and some balancing would be so welcome that I believe this game could be as massive an indie hit as Terraria or Rogue Legacy. There are other small issues but none so large as this balancing issue, improve it and I'll keep playing but until then the game is almost unplayable. Signing off now.... a gamer that really things your game has massive potential.\n\nUpdate: I'm extremely pleased that a swimming trait is possible to obtain now, but it's stifled by these new instant death traits. I don't mind a few negatives to keep the game interesting but going out and just implementing instant death traits even on the captain at the very start of the game (Such as the "old" trait which causes random death at any given moment.(Yes this happened to me!)) add to the already chaotic difficulty I've talked about already. These new traits that cause death such as falling off the boat along with being "old" almost demand that you save scum just to get an average pirate or they have no chance of surviving whatsoever. Don't read this and think I'm ungrateful, the fact that I can swim now is a fantastic boon, but the instant death traits are just far to out of control. Perhaps you could add new passives such as a swimming technique (Ultimate) or a life jacket that isn't destroyed much like the other passive item. (I forgot the name of it.)\nSincerely yours a gamer that really hopes you find a balance you and the players can both agree on entirely, have a great day!","March 18, 2014","true","47.7"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

It is a rogue-like adventure/action game.  The game itself has come a long way. You are a pirate, a captain. Customize your own ship to your liking, hire a crew to defend you and defeat the legendary pirates! You'll find yourself fighting off hostile pirates on their ships, animals, tribe members, and hobos on islands to open a chest and get loot!\nYou'll also be adding ability books for your pirates to help you along your jouneys, the books can be purchased in stores found in towns, or dropped rarely by a few things..\nManaging your crew is a VERY important aspect to survive, you must keep your crew well fed and happy (high morale) unless you want them to die or turn against you and try to kill your entire crew.\nWhen you first start a game, you'll be asked 3 questions which you'll answer. According to what your owner, your game will be affected a little bit.\nThe developers of this game are amazing, they listen to the people and do their best to make them happy, being someone who has played this game since alpha, i can say that they have not been a let down.

As soon as i saw Re-logic(terraria devs) were involved, i knew it.\n\nThe beauty of this game is the same as in terraria. A complex game, with rich details and interesting mechanics, that blends strategy (ship building, crew forming) with rpg (skill giving, gearing, lvling) in an extremely simple way that is reflected on its graphics... Simple ♥♥♥♥in pixels...\n\nIt is damn addicting.. it is simpler and faster than "space pirate and zombies", it is better working than "craft the world", it is actually more action packed than "Sid Meier's Pirate" and its fun as f0cK!!!\n\nYou build your crew, you gear them up, you give them skills, you build your boat, you plunder ships and dig up loot... lol what else can i say!? This game is rich in mechanics but not at complex as it seems!!! took me 2 minutes to actually understand stats and lvling and gear. Its simple and no tutorial is actually required (eventhough there is a short 1).\n\nThe amount of hours i have in this game were in the course of 3-4 days... i literally stopped doing everything else just to play this ♥♥♥♥. Alas a game that made me forget everything for a short time lol.\n\nThe only "meh" thing, is the music,  buuuttt i guess if it were anything different than the simple tune it is, i wouldnt enjoy it after 13 hours of straight playing\n\nFURTHERMOAAARRROAARR!!!

I just clicked anywhere hoping that I will finally achieve something, but I couldn't. I died like 3 times and I didn't really know why. The very big con for me is that after 5 minutes of playing, I got like 5 or 6 achievements, so it wasn't a very big effort, especially when I didn't know what I was doing. Achievements should be granted for achieving something, obviously... Well, maybe disobeying the urge to exit this game as soon as possible was something I was honoured for ;).

The result is a very weak example of each and every one of those genres—if I didn’t consider it overly charitable to call it a ‘jack’ of anything, the saying ‘jack of all trades, master of none’ would apply.

So no more jibber-jatter, lets start reviewing.\n\nPixel Piracy is a sidescrolling 2D Pirate Simulator, yes, simulator. The words might be a shock to you as the game looks very, very silly and cute, however it precisely simulates how pirates were in the 1800's, because, of course we all know pirates had floating ships, no sails, and of course, submarines and poles out of wood. Becides that, though, the game is very realistic in terms of the hardcore (No respawn) and fighting and survival aspects of the game. Food, weapons, money, salaries, are all active needs for you and your crew to survive on these great seas. You can make your own ships block by block from what you buy at shops, you can plunder enemy ships, and islands, take there ships. And even buy rum to really get the feeling of piracy. Taking slaves and prisoners is an upcoming feature I am really looking forward too. The game is in real time, and is single player. AT-THE-MOMENT. They have promised a multiplayer (No info on that yet) upon release, which I am very excited to see how it's all peaced together!\n\nRate: 8.7/10. (This may change depending on updates)\n\n---(No need to read this)\nIf you guys like my reviews or anything please be sure to follow me around and check out my other reviews on games like Door Kickers, DayZ, etc. I'm not much a diehard fan for any game so most if not all my reviews are completely honest, and thanks for reading, feel free for feedback and rate!\n---","January 8, 2014","true","3.6"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","9","17","0","0"

Ive only played a bit of it and i cant even fathom how much more stuff I have to discover. This game is a hilarious, cute and funny pixel by pixel rendition of what it would be like to be a pirate!\n\nIt has a serious, "Its a permadeath game so dont like, ... die." element to it but it seems to focus more on the side of, "Game Over! you got killed by a chicken!" (That actually happened like to me) The funny and goofy side while funny, somehow dosent take to much away from the game like most, "Goofy" games do.\n\nThe ship building, while it has a slight learning curve manages to be simple, easy and fun. Though your first ship will most definatly look like a large piece of Caribbian Seagul feces, you will quickly catch on and find a sophisticated design that works for you!\n\nThe RPG side of the game and the complicated leveling system may look daunting at first, but give it maybe, 3 times around of playing the game and getting you ♥♥♥ handed too you and you will quickly undersand why it is 300 pieces of gold to train a crew member to clean the seagull crap off you deck. The leveling system may have a rather large learning curve but it too, is quite sophisticated and well thought through.\n\nNow, the hard part...Combat. for most players, your first hour will mainly consist of repeatedly getting your ♥♥♥ handed too you by an oyster or a cute little chicken, (By the way the animation for killing those feathery sons-a-♥♥♥♥♥es is extremly satisfying, as with every other death animation, even when your precious captain dies a wonderstruck sense of awe hits you like a ♥♥♥♥ covered brick to the face.) I will admit it is a little bit unpolished, but I see the potential in it. As of right now it isnt the easiest to handle, (My stategy is buying every crew member I can find and then rushing in and hope one of them is still alive after.) But nevertheless it shows unprecidentable promise. (I really hope i spelt that right and used it correctly in the right context.)...(I has bad englishes)\n\nSo in short, This game is Amazing and buy it right now, support the developers and help them make it better...\n\nIts worth it.\n\n\nAll the best game playening,\n\nDelusionalKitty","January 26, 2014","true","22.7"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","9","17","0","1"

Garbage like this is why real piracy exists. Charging even 1 cent for this game is where the real piracy is. This game is so awful that the original devs abandoned it and some other guy bought it out. It is really awful even if I keep playing and try to figure out what to do. No wonder at one point this game had mostly negative reviews. I guess it has been worked on over the year it has been out and improved. It still sucks so badly that I would hate to see what it was like when it first came out. It does not deserve the mostly positive reviews that it has now because it just sucks. A prime example of how not to make a indie game. Lack of direction, non-intuitive controls, and stupid logic. The interface is mainly what is so unintuitive about the game. It is riddled with glitches, bugs, and technical problems out the wazzu according to other users. The game has a complete lack of technical polish. One of the most technically unsound games I have ever played. A very messy game all around. It just never felt tight and smooth for me like any other good game would, just felt like a rough garbled mess of a pre-alpha because it basically is. You and your crew are mentally incapable (much like this games creators) of taking a dump over the side of the ship so your ship just fills up with feces. The first island I "sailed" to had a few little creatures on it. I got off with my captain and tried going to them to use the "move animal" command. They started attacking me which is fine they are wild animals, but I couldn't kill them even though they are what looks to be chickens and ferrets. They chase me back to the ship. I command my crew of two to go and kill them, they immediately knockback my crew off the island into the water where not only can they not swim, they sink to the bottom of the ocean, game over.\n\nThey also treat the gamer like an idiot as well and make fun of you just to be smart a--es on purpose. The first time a pirate killed me I got a achievement called "Noob". Purposely called a noob by the developers because I died because of their total lack of direction lol. They celebrate the fact that the game has knockback by asking you what percentage of knockback you want when you start a new game, like they are saying "ha ha, our game has knock back like it or not". The game should not have knockback. Why should it? Do I fly 5ft backwards irl when a ferret touches me? Why does this game need to have knockback? Why does any game for that matter? Do I jump in water and immediately sink and drown irl? Does anybody? No, but they don't care what you as a gamer think and that is strikingly apparant in every area of this game's horrible, flawed, outdated and broken design.\n\nI have never seen a game this badly void of any basic logic and with such a heavy lack of direction and unintuitive controls. There was no music and the only sound effects are a ten year old kid saying "son of a biscuit!" over and over and over and over nonstop and some other pirate phrases being said in either high pitch voices to sound like chipmonks or low pitched which still sounds like a ten year old kids voice being pitch shifted low.\n\nI got this in a bundle I bought for Unepic, which is a good game. They might as well have bundled a bloody vag rag with aids on it with Unepic instead of this game. This game is going into the trash bin. You want a real sailing game where you get to be a pirate? Play Assassin's Creed 4. Out of the 570+ games I own on steam, this is in the top ten for worst.\n\nIf you were allowed to trade your games and I could trade this for a punch in the nose I would consider that totally fair because that is about what this dog ♥♥♥♥ suck garbage is worth. -100/10.

Pixel Piracy is a pirate simulator. Now, who wouldn’t want to try out a pirate simulator?\n\nIt may sound fun, but it is really, really hard. The game also has permadeath, which just adds to the fun, well, if you’re good at the game at least. You’ll need to start by building a ship and, optionally, hiring a someone to be on your crew. The crew system is a bit annoying, because oftentimes the crew will just ignore your orders because they lack loyalty. Loyalty can be gained by paying them in gold, the game’s currency.\n\nThe game’s shipbuilding is a bit weird. My first ship looked like a block, but it still worked. In fact, all of the early game enemies also had terrible-looking ships, just like mine. Later in the game, you’ll get to build cooler ships, assuming you don’t die along the way. I’ve yet to get far enough to build a really fancy ship, so I’ll just stick with my floating blocks of wood for now. Pixel Piracy also has an RPG element to go along with it. It’s rather complex, but adds a lot to the game and I really enjoy its addition.\n\nEarly-game, I had a lot of trouble with combat. I was terrible at it. The combat is really unpredictable, there is little to no indication of whether or not you will win a fight. With more crewmates, however, the chances of winning in combat rise immensely, especially when you’ve got six or so guys and they got three.

I enjoyed playing it after the initial 20minutes it took me to realise WTF I was doing, and learnt which fights to avoid (hover over enemies to check their health).\n\nA tutorial would be fantastic, as it's a little bit tough to get your head around what is going on. I still dont know how to catch animals, but theres a whole menu for it when you press esc. Speaking of, the escape menu is terrible. You cant check your inventory without going to the individual pirates page and equiping them, you need to press a little hidden button in the top left to set sail when you've navigated to an area and there's not really any indication of what you can do/when.\nThe AI for crew and captain is terrible, you have to click like a madman to get out of a fight you are losing. There's minimal ways to heal an injured teammate. There's no direction to the game either, no overarching story line that'd "hook" me to play again.\n\nSaying that, when I was playing I was having fun blowing up ships and trying to cheat the RNG encounters at sea. It's cute seeing captain feathersword get his ♥♥♥ handed to him time and time again.\n\nAll in all, needs more work done to it to turn this concept game into a functioning, polished, user-friendly state.\n4/10.\n\nTL;DR - Pirates! The difficulty curve is too high for too little reward. Pick this game up in a few years.","June 24, 2014","false","6.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Build your own ship,  You can make big ships that you can design 100% completely as you wish.\n2. Hire a huge crew,  In games like this with crew you can get i.e FTL (great game also recommend) you have a small crew\nin Pixel Piracy you can have a massive crew of over 20 people,  You can level them up teach them ect ect\n3.  A huge map with many encounters,  The encounters in the game can be islands towns ships and legendary ships (from what I have found)\n4.  Cheats!  If you want a more easy going sandbox mod you can use cheats to give you XP, Food, Moral, health, crew, money,  And rain thousands of cannon balls on your enemies.\n\n\nThe bad:\n1 Glitches!  20 minutes in I ran into a glitch that stopped me from doing anything on that run.\n2 The controls,  Not the best in a game there not the worst but are hard and confusing to learn how to control everything\n3 The "Tutorial"  When you start you just get thrown in...

FANTASTIC. Love it. So much fun.\nHowever...\nBesides the occasional bugs, there are some balancing issues that need to be addressed.\n\n1. Gold.\nIs it just me or is it INSANELY difficult to get gold early on? Eventually you get to the point where you have cannons and lvl.3 computers don't, so you just hit one after the other racking up gold, BUT until that point, you are constantantly resetting games either because of too few crew members trying to take on too many enemies, or a LOT of unexperienced, untrained, combat-feeder crew members who sit around, poop, and eat you out of house and home (ship).\nIt took me a bit to find a nice balance, but it first had to start with...\n\n2. Starting Captain\nWould you believe me if I told you that, in my 2nd game, I started out with a Captain who had 1 strength and 1 vitality?...Completely worthless. I even tried to make it work. Couldn't 1v1 a crab.\nIf the developers were going for truly random stats, CONGRATS. You did it.\nIt took me until my 4th game to get a character with balanced enough stats to run with.\n\n3. Cannons are OP.\nCan anyone tell me a legitamite reason to why I have to train my seafears how to swim? Let's just say someone can convince me there is legitimacy to this game mechanic.... My point still stands. Even with the knockback on the lowest of settings, my crew are flying off my ship and drowning. If it's my captain, well I'm screwed. I get that cannons are powerful, as they should be, but something about the knockback just feels so off. "So, how'd you die?" "I was hit by a cannon....which made me fly into the water and I can't swim..." Something seems off. Explosions do knockback, but when the ratio of person/ship size is as miscalculated as this game, you can kill people at 75% of their health but just pushing them into water.\n\n4. I decided just to try my luck against a LEGENDARY boss when I KNEW I was FAR too underleveled to go against (I could barely beat level 4 CPU's) because, heck why not! The game asks me to save every other second (autosave feature? anyone?) so I knew that even when I failed I could still go back to the very second before I decieded to do it.\nI won. Wasn't even hard.\nThe enemies had lower health than the enemies in level 4 ships and I only lost 1 crew member...And my ship was perfectly intact. There is something fishy about it, no doubt.\nNot to mention, I then steal the legendary ship and get 5/6 free cannons. With Gold as hard to get as it is, that's a HUGE boost for me.\n\n5. LASTLY, I get that this game is 2 dimensional in that it's a 2d scrolling game. But does the gameplay have to be so....two dimensional? (Sorry, bad pun) While playing this game I ACTUALLY had this thought, "Man, this game is so fricken fun, even though It's the same thing over and over again...oh...."\nThere needs to be another aspect to this game. Building shops on Islands to get revenue? Taking over FORTS on islands? Getting several ships to make a FLEET? SAVING HOT BABES?\n\nThis game is fun, well worth the money...but by balancing some of the things I've mentioned and adding just ONE more aspect to this game would go from me telling my friends about this game to forcing them to buy it.\n\nGraphics: 5/10 So much noise on the screen, it's hard to see. But if you are buying this game for the graphics, you're an idiot anyways.\nGameplay: 8/10 Fun. Repetative, but fun and challenging.\nStory: 4/10 Is there one? Meh, being a pirate is cool enough.\nAudio: 6/10 I get sick of hearing my pirates talk after a short while. But love the music.\n\nBest aspect: Replayability.\nWorst aspect: Lack of diversity in gameplay (I think that's the best way to put it)\n\nTL;DR\nBuy it. It's fun. And difficult.6\n","June 17, 2014","true","54.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Pixel Piracy is a pirate simulator. Now, who wouldn’t want to try out a pirate simulator?\n\nIt may sound fun, but it is really, really hard. The game also has permadeath, which just adds to the fun, well, if you’re good at the game at least. You’ll need to start by building a ship and, optionally, hiring a someone to be on your crew. The crew system is a bit annoying, because oftentimes the crew will just ignore your orders because they lack loyalty. Loyalty can be gained by paying them in gold, the game’s currency.\n\nThe game’s shipbuilding is a bit weird. My first ship looked like a block, but it still worked. In fact, all of the early game enemies also had terrible-looking ships, just like mine. Later in the game, you’ll get to build cooler ships, assuming you don’t die along the way. I’ve yet to get far enough to build a really fancy ship, so I’ll just stick with my floating blocks of wood for now. Pixel Piracy also has an RPG element to go along with it. It’s rather complex, but adds a lot to the game and I really enjoy its addition.\n\nEarly-game, I had a lot of trouble with combat. I was terrible at it. The combat is really unpredictable, there is little to no indication of whether or not you will win a fight. With more crewmates, however, the chances of winning in combat rise immensely, especially when you’ve got six or so guys and they got three. The combat could be better, but the game is in early access, so changes could be made along the way.\n\nAlthough the game is difficult, I find enjoyment in it anyways.

FANTASTIC. Love it. So much fun.\nHowever...\nBesides the occasional bugs, there are some balancing issues that need to be addressed.\n\n1. Gold.\nIs it just me or is it INSANELY difficult to get gold early on? Eventually you get to the point where you have cannons and lvl.3 computers don't, so you just hit one after the other racking up gold, BUT until that point, you are constantantly resetting games either because of too few crew members trying to take on too many enemies, or a LOT of unexperienced, untrained, combat-feeder crew members who sit around, poop, and eat you out of house and home (ship).\nIt took me a bit to find a nice balance, but it first had to start with...\n\n2. Starting Captain\nWould you believe me if I told you that, in my 2nd game, I started out with a Captain who had 1 strength and 1 vitality?...Completely worthless. I even tried to make it work. Couldn't 1v1 a crab.\nIf the developers were going for truly random stats, CONGRATS. You did it.\nIt took me until my 4th game to get a character with balanced enough stats to run with.\n\n3. Cannons are OP.\nCan anyone tell me a legitamite reason to why I have to train my seafears how to swim? Let's just say someone can convince me there is legitimacy to this game mechanic.... My point still stands. Even with the knockback on the lowest of settings, my crew are flying off my ship and drowning. If it's my captain, well I'm screwed. I get that cannons are powerful, as they should be, but something about the knockback just feels so off. "So, how'd you die?" "I was hit by a cannon....which made me fly into the water and I can't swim..." Something seems off. Explosions do knockback, but when the ratio of person/ship size is as miscalculated as this game, you can kill people at 75% of their health but just pushing them into water.\n\n4. I decided just to try my luck against a LEGENDARY boss when I KNEW I was FAR too underleveled to go against (I could barely beat level 4 CPU's) because, heck why not! The game asks me to save every other second (autosave feature? anyone?) so I knew that even when I failed I could still go back to the very second before I decieded to do it.\nI won. Wasn't even hard.\nThe enemies had lower health than the enemies in level 4 ships and I only lost 1 crew member...And my ship was perfectly intact. There is something fishy about it, no doubt.\nNot to mention, I then steal the legendary ship and get 5/6 free cannons. With Gold as hard to get as it is, that's a HUGE boost for me.\n\n5. LASTLY, I get that this game is 2 dimensional in that it's a 2d scrolling game. But does the gameplay have to be so....two dimensional? (Sorry, bad pun) While playing this game I ACTUALLY had this thought, "Man, this game is so fricken fun, even though It's the same thing over and over again...oh...."\nThere needs to be another aspect to this game. Building shops on Islands to get revenue? Taking over FORTS on islands? Getting several ships to make a FLEET? SAVING HOT BABES?\n\nThis game is fun, well worth the money...but by balancing some of the things I've mentioned and adding just ONE more aspect to this game would go from me telling my friends about this game to forcing them to buy it.\n\nGraphics: 5/10 So much noise on the screen, it's hard to see. But if you are buying this game for the graphics, you're an idiot anyways.\nGameplay: 8/10 Fun. Repetative, but fun and challenging.\nStory: 4/10 Is there one? Meh, being a pirate is cool enough.\nAudio: 6/10 I get sick of hearing my pirates talk after a short while. But love the music.\n\nBest aspect: Replayability.\nWorst aspect: Lack of diversity in gameplay (I think that's the best way to put it)\n\nTL;DR\nBuy it. It's fun. And difficult.6\n","June 17, 2014","true","54.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

While it could use some more polish and some of the interfacing could be a little better, it is not a complete game. You can build a pirate ship, starting from a few free blocks, and basically it's a pirate sim from there. Start from boarding other small crafts to shooting cannons from your gigantic ship. There is a few things to keep track of though and time management is also a factor.

Let's take it apart, piece by piece-\n\nGraphics(3/10)- Obviously one of the first things you'll notice about the game, Pixel Piracy falls pretty flat here. First off, the entire game is smothered in a layer of bloom that adjusting the game's graphics settings seems to do nothing to lessen. I'm fairly certain there are only two backgrounds in the entire game, one for land, and one for sea, and neither are very interesting. And while there's not really anything wrong with the actual visual game elements, it looks like the sort of pixel style that is not done to deliberately invoke a retro or indie feel, but one that comes of a developer who is either very lazy or very short on funds. The characters are ugly, the items are unrecognizable, and the game world is just incredibly samey. So, in short, while it's not physically painful to look at, that's really the best I can say of it, and even that's not true sometimes.\n\nSound(1/10)- Jesus god in heaven help me. If you can play this for more than a minute with the sound on, you are a stronger person than I will ever be. The game's bgm consists of 4, maybe five, tracks that are nothing but 30-45 second loops of the most utterly uninspired MIDI music you can imagine. Incredibly, that's the good part of the sound design, because all the effects are even worse. The general game sound effects are repetitive and aggravating, but they pale in comparison to the game's voice clips. Every different character in this game is assigned one of an astoundingly large number of 2 second clips of what I can only assume are people the devs pulled off the street to read Klingon backwards into 50 year old microphones. And the game is really proud of them, so it plays one for you every time ANYTHING happens, which equates to about 6000 times on every single sailing voyage you take. Maybe that's not enough for you? How about "sea shanties"? By which I mean another awful MIDI track under a tinny voice that makes me want to poke my eardrums out crooning some hilariously cringeworthy g-rated pirate themed lyrics. Because that's what this game has to offer. You get the picture. I hope you get the picture. Please don't make me talk about the game's sound anymore.\n\nStory(Not even really applicable/10)- There isn't any. That's it. Probaby better that way, to be honest. Moving on.\n\nGameplay(2/10)- This section is depressingly similar to the last one. The "gameplay" can really be divided into three categories: preparing to do stuff, doing stuff, and waiting for the stuff you've done to happen. The preparing to do stuff is probably where you'll spend a majority of the game. This accounts for all time spent in shops and menus and stat screens. this is where you hire crew members and buy weapons and upgrade your ship and teach your crew how to poop properly (no, really). This is the closest the game the game comes to being fun, but it would come a lot closer if any of this crap I've mentioned ACTUALLY WORKED. This game legitmately has the least intuitive and most perplexing UI I've ever encountered. Equipment screens are confusing, skills are absurd, and whoever thought doing 90% of all in-game actions from a pause screen was a good idea really oughta be killed. But once you've emerged from the menu maze you get the tremendous pleasure of ...*wait for it*... clicking. That's it. That's all you really get to do. You click. To attack or to move or to dig or to plunder, you click. Once. Maybe twice. And then you wait. Absolutely NOTHING in this game is in a hurry. Sailing is slow, your crew moves slow, scroling the camera is slow. And then, once you're done waiting, head back to the menus. I am in no way exaggerating when I say that's all there is to the game. That's literally it. And don't think for a second that there are a variety of environements to explore. You've got your towns, your deserted islands, your open sea, and your ship battles. Once again, no exaggeration. That's it. And I'm really not kidding about this game's bizarre obsession with poop. There are a myriad of skills, items, and acheivements relating to fecal matter. Kind fitting really.\n\nSo, wouldn't it be nice to have a game where you could design your own captain and build your own ship and mold your own crew and sail the open seas to find treaure, love, and destiny? You better believe it would. Is that game Pixel Piracy? No. No it is not.\n\n2/10, incredibly disappointing, do not purchase.","February 8, 2015","false","8.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Pixel Piracy is a pirate simulator. Now, who wouldn’t want to try out a pirate simulator?\n\nIt may sound fun, but it is really, really hard. The game also has permadeath, which just adds to the fun, well, if you’re good at the game at least. You’ll need to start by building a ship and, optionally, hiring a someone to be on your crew. The crew system is a bit annoying, because oftentimes the crew will just ignore your orders because they lack loyalty. Loyalty can be gained by paying them in gold, the game’s currency.\n\nThe game’s shipbuilding is a bit weird. My first ship looked like a block, but it still worked. In fact, all of the early game enemies also had terrible-looking ships, just like mine. Later in the game, you’ll get to build cooler ships, assuming you don’t die along the way. I’ve yet to get far enough to build a really fancy ship, so I’ll just stick with my floating blocks of wood for now. Pixel Piracy also has an RPG element to go along with it. It’s rather complex, but adds a lot to the game and I really enjoy its addition.\n\nEarly-game, I had a lot of trouble with combat. I was terrible at it. The combat is really unpredictable, there is little to no indication of whether or not you will win a fight. With more crewmates, however, the chances of winning in combat rise immensely, especially when you’ve got six or so guys and they got three. The combat could be better, but the game is in early access, so changes could be made along the way.\n\nAlthough the game is difficult, I find enjoyment in it anyways. I’ll get better at it as I play, for sure.","February 21, 2014","true","0.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ConnorZombie/recommended/264140/","ConnorZombie","Connor Zombie","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ConnorZombie/","277 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nWelcome to Pixel Piracy, an extremely so-far-underated game that is currently under Early Access. Though for a game that claims it is in alpha, it is quite fleshed out with new content being added pretty much every week.\n\nTaking control of a custom pirate captain with randomly generated voice and model (chosen partially by the player) coupled with the fact that one death means game over means you really get attached to your captain and eventual crew. Ship customization isn't as extensive as I'd like it to be, but once again it's alpha, and with new content pumped out extremely often, I wouldn't be surprised if we had an extremely fleshed out game by the time summer hits.\n\nOh look, another game with pixels. How indie\n\nWhile this may be a legitimate argument, the fact that the developer has gone straight pixel just means that content can be pumped out faster and it doesn't detract from the style, as the sound design really immerses you into the enviroments it portrays.\n\nThe game has many MANY bugs, more so than most Early Access games I've seen, limited to things like a lack of proper intelligent AI commands, some spawning issues, and a sparsity in what to do after getting a substantial crew, but the developers are extremely active in their pursuits to make this the best game they can be, as I've had many of my questions asked answered on their Twitter/Steam discussion page.\n\nOverall, for an Early Access game, I was highly impressed. I played around 10 hours of Titanfall before getting bored, and while I'm approaching the 10 hour mark on Pixel Piracy, I like to believe it will keep me held for a lot longer than that.","March 17, 2014","true","11.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I was practically blind going into this, I hadn't even seen gameplay footage, just a screenshot showing off a large, complex ship, fighting another large complex ship with a whole lot of bloom lighting effects.\n\nTurns out there's a lot more to this game than just the bloom graphics. The game is essentially an extremely accessible risk vs. reward strategy game, where progress is rewarded with more money to purchase shipbuilding materials, skills, hire more crewmembers, tools, weapons, etc. Because it's easy to get jump aboard and get right to playing and making progress, the game is extremely accessible to new players of the strategy genre.\n\nWhat hooked me is ship building. The game has this focus on gaining more and more material to build your ship with by destroying other ships to loot their materials, allowing you to add on to your own ship using them. Additionally, you can purchase new materials and decorations for your ship with gold you earn from taking on enemy ships and plundering their precious loot.\n\nWhile I got the game for free due (Thanks Gameiki.com and HERO) I would definitely say it’s worth the money they’re asking for, and since Relogic aquired publishing rights for the game, there is probably, like 1000s of steam coupons floating around for the game if you don’t have it and want a discount.

I hope they will add much content (or modding support?).\n\n\nAll in all, I had and still have fun with this game, even in the current state, so I can recommend this game to people who want to support the developers and can take a peek into the game, but not to people who want to have a finished game.","May 12, 2014","true","17.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

First thing is sound, There is only 3 diffrent crew voices. Normally this wouldn't bother me except for the fact that your crew never shuts up. You either have Satin 1, Satin 2 or Chipmunks. Another thing is that your crew is ALWAYS talking to each other both outloud and a chat bar over their heads. The reason I hate the chat bar is because 90% of the things they say are from Pirates Of The Carribbean and the rest of it is stuff like "your my favorite pirate" and "next drink is on me" and "let's plunder". Second thing is how stereotypical this game is. Remember when you were in like 4th grade learning about pirates but they never talked about the graphic stuff? That's what this game is, except for when someone dies and ther torso goes flying 10 feet away with a crappy trail of blood in one of the most unrealistic ways I have ever seen in a game. It seems like the only things the Devs know about pirates comes from Pirates Of The Carribbean and learning about them in fourth grade. Most people buy this game because they think it's a Pirate version of Terrarria, it's not that at all. I don't want to be too harsh but I also want to tell you not to buy this game.","August 19, 2014","false","1.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","3"

Let's take it apart, piece by piece-\n\nGraphics(3/10)- Obviously one of the first things you'll notice about the game, Pixel Piracy falls pretty flat here. First off, the entire game is smothered in a layer of bloom that adjusting the game's graphics settings seems to do nothing to lessen. I'm fairly certain there are only two backgrounds in the entire game, one for land, and one for sea, and neither are very interesting. And while there's not really anything wrong with the actual visual game elements, it looks like the sort of pixel style that is not done to deliberately invoke a retro or indie feel, but one that comes of a developer who is either very lazy or very short on funds. The characters are ugly, the items are unrecognizable, and the game world is just incredibly samey. So, in short, while it's not physically painful to look at, that's really the best I can say of it, and even that's not true sometimes.\n\nSound(1/10)- Jesus god in heaven help me. If you can play this for more than a minute with the sound on, you are a stronger person than I will ever be. The game's bgm consists of 4, maybe five, tracks that are nothing but 30-45 second loops of the most utterly uninspired MIDI music you can imagine. Incredibly, that's the good part of the sound design, because all the effects are even worse. The general game sound effects are repetitive and aggravating, but they pale in comparison to the game's voice clips. Every different character in this game is assigned one of an astoundingly large number of 2 second clips of what I can only assume are people the devs pulled off the street to read Klingon backwards into 50 year old microphones. And the game is really proud of them, so it plays one for you every time ANYTHING happens, which equates to about 6000 times on every single sailing voyage you take. Maybe that's not enough for you? How about "sea shanties"? By which I mean another awful MIDI track under a tinny voice that makes me want to poke my eardrums out crooning some hilariously cringeworthy g-rated pirate themed lyrics. Because that's what this game has to offer. You get the picture. I hope you get the picture. Please don't make me talk about the game's sound anymore.\n\nStory(Not even really applicable/10)- There isn't any. That's it. Probaby better that way, to be honest. Moving on.\n\nGameplay(2/10)- This section is depressingly similar to the last one. The "gameplay" can really be divided into three categories: preparing to do stuff, doing stuff, and waiting for the stuff you've done to happen. The preparing to do stuff is probably where you'll spend a majority of the game. This accounts for all time spent in shops and menus and stat screens. this is where you hire crew members and buy weapons and upgrade your ship and teach your crew how to poop properly (no, really). This is the closest the game the game comes to being fun, but it would come a lot closer if any of this crap I've mentioned ACTUALLY WORKED. This game legitmately has the least intuitive and most perplexing UI I've ever encountered. Equipment screens are confusing, skills are absurd, and whoever thought doing 90% of all in-game actions from a pause screen was a good idea really oughta be killed. But once you've emerged from the menu maze you get the tremendous pleasure of ...*wait for it*... clicking. That's it. That's all you really get to do. You click. To attack or to move or to dig or to plunder, you click. Once. Maybe twice. And then you wait. Absolutely NOTHING in this game is in a hurry. Sailing is slow, your crew moves slow, scroling the camera is slow. And then, once you're done waiting, head back to the menus. I am in no way exaggerating when I say that's all there is to the game. That's literally it. And don't think for a second that there are a variety of environements to explore. You've got your towns, your deserted islands, your open sea, and your ship battles. Once again, no exaggeration. That's it. And I'm really not kidding about this game's bizarre obsession with poop. There are a myriad of skills, items, and acheivements relating to fecal matter. Kind fitting really.\n\nSo, wouldn't it be nice to have a game where you could design your own captain and build your own ship and mold your own crew and sail the open seas to find treaure, love, and destiny? You better believe it would. Is that game Pixel Piracy? No. No it is not.\n\n2/10, incredibly disappointing, do not purchase.","February 8, 2015","false","8.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Let's take it apart, piece by piece-\n\nGraphics(3/10)- Obviously one of the first things you'll notice about the game, Pixel Piracy falls pretty flat here. First off, the entire game is smothered in a layer of bloom that adjusting the game's graphics settings seems to do nothing to lessen. I'm fairly certain there are only two backgrounds in the entire game, one for land, and one for sea, and neither are very interesting. And while there's not really anything wrong with the actual visual game elements, it looks like the sort of pixel style that is not done to deliberately invoke a retro or indie feel, but one that comes of a developer who is either very lazy or very short on funds. The characters are ugly, the items are unrecognizable, and the game world is just incredibly samey. So, in short, while it's not physically painful to look at, that's really the best I can say of it, and even that's not true sometimes.\n\nSound(1/10)- Jesus god in heaven help me. If you can play this for more than a minute with the sound on, you are a stronger person than I will ever be. The game's bgm consists of 4, maybe five, tracks that are nothing but 30-45 second loops of the most utterly uninspired MIDI music you can imagine. Incredibly, that's the good part of the sound design, because all the effects are even worse. The general game sound effects are repetitive and aggravating, but they pale in comparison to the game's voice clips. Every different character in this game is assigned one of an astoundingly large number of 2 second clips of what I can only assume are people the devs pulled off the street to read Klingon backwards into 50 year old microphones. And the game is really proud of them, so it plays one for you every time ANYTHING happens, which equates to about 6000 times on every single sailing voyage you take. Maybe that's not enough for you? How about "sea shanties"? By which I mean another awful MIDI track under a tinny voice that makes me want to poke my eardrums out crooning some hilariously cringeworthy g-rated pirate themed lyrics. Because that's what this game has to offer. You get the picture. I hope you get the picture. Please don't make me talk about the game's sound anymore.\n\nStory(Not even really applicable/10)- There isn't any. That's it. Probaby better that way, to be honest. Moving on.\n\nGameplay(2/10)- This section is depressingly similar to the last one. The "gameplay" can really be divided into three categories: preparing to do stuff, doing stuff, and waiting for the stuff you've done to happen. The preparing to do stuff is probably where you'll spend a majority of the game. This accounts for all time spent in shops and menus and stat screens. this is where you hire crew members and buy weapons and upgrade your ship and teach your crew how to poop properly (no, really). This is the closest the game the game comes to being fun, but it would come a lot closer if any of this crap I've mentioned ACTUALLY WORKED. This game legitmately has the least intuitive and most perplexing UI I've ever encountered. Equipment screens are confusing, skills are absurd, and whoever thought doing 90% of all in-game actions from a pause screen was a good idea really oughta be killed. But once you've emerged from the menu maze you get the tremendous pleasure of ...*wait for it*... clicking. That's it. That's all you really get to do. You click. To attack or to move or to dig or to plunder, you click. Once. Maybe twice. And then you wait. Absolutely NOTHING in this game is in a hurry. Sailing is slow, your crew moves slow, scroling the camera is slow. And then, once you're done waiting, head back to the menus. I am in no way exaggerating when I say that's all there is to the game. That's literally it. And don't think for a second that there are a variety of environements to explore. You've got your towns, your deserted islands, your open sea, and your ship battles. Once again, no exaggeration. That's it. And I'm really not kidding about this game's bizarre obsession with poop. There are a myriad of skills, items, and acheivements relating to fecal matter. Kind fitting really.\n\nSo, wouldn't it be nice to have a game where you could design your own captain and build your own ship and mold your own crew and sail the open seas to find treaure, love, and destiny? You better believe it would. Is that game Pixel Piracy? No. No it is not.\n\n2/10, incredibly disappointing, do not purchase.","February 8, 2015","false","8.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I forgot to buy food and almost starved.  A little later my crab died during a raid. I was demoralized. Then the turtle shortly after drowned after being knocked off the ship. I promised myself the same wouldn't happen with the dog. So I hired a REAL crew, the Krusty Krew. I had a cook , a poo cleaner a cannonneer , and 2 fighter specialists.\n\nOh! Did we raid, we sunk many ships, killed dozens of natives, pooped everywhere, and drank rum all the time. But....unfortunately this game was early access.  After raiding a ship, you destroy it up to get its contents. The dog Douglass was on the  enemy ship and for some reason the command to carry him to ours wasn't working. So with tears in my eyes  I blew up the enemy ship and watched Douglass perish too.\n\nTo this day me and my 8 man crew still pillag, still drink , and still laugh but we don't forget the original crew who set sail with me long before.....\n\n8/10 very fun, but will remind you occasionally that its early access.","July 10, 2014","true","32.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","1"

Gameplay is addictive, it's all the right amounts of pirate sim and strategy. My biggest concern before I bought it was that I'd be clicking my index or middle finger sore. Not at all! Fit for a quick casual game session.\n\nDo I recommend it? Yes.\n\nThat being said, I consider this game to still be in beta. I can't believe the developers released this game in it's currently bug-riddled state. I write this review after quitting because my captain grappled (I think) over to a ship that I plundered and sunk. Did this result in his death and the end of my current game? Why, yes it did. Is that the only bug I've come across? Funny you should ask because no it is not. Sometimes crew members won't leave the ship (this is important because they need to offload and get crunk to keep up morale.) Sometimes crew members will grab a pile of ♥♥♥♥ and walk back and forth in some sort of OCD "oh no, somebody pooped, what do i do what do i do what do i do...?" I even had a guy who decided that training was more important than eating, so he lost half his health to starvation right before a battle. My mom always made sure I was well fed before battle.\n\nThese are clearly bugs. Crew AI is whack. However, balance (specifically morale) also needs a little work. I spend more money on rum keeping my pirates happy than I make pillaging. Sometimes I feel that way IRL, but this is supposed to be an escape. I don't want to spend all my money on booze in real life and then in video games too!\n\nSomeone called the art 'unpolished.' Yes. Well. It's pixels. I'm totally cool with it: I get the idea and the game never lags. But wtf is up with the shadows on my ship? They are very bizarre and make the game look even more alpha than it is. Just get rid of the shadows if you can't figure out how lighting works.\n\nSummary:\nI bought this game on sale for $7. I think I have probably paid more for an alpha or early access game, but I knew what I was getting into in that case. I sincerely hope the devs fix what seem to be just a few really annoying bugs and minor gameplay issues. If they do, this game is worth $15. I STRONGLY recommend not paying $15 for version 1.0.5 because it is not a finished product. In this age of paying for alphas, it is up to the dev to honestly label a game incomplete. I love the current ecosystem of indie games and small devs, but you guys gotta watch that ♥♥♥♥, or we as consumers are going back to EA. Well, maybe not. But you get what I mean.\n\nBuy it the next time it goes on sale. I assume by then it will be a finished product.","August 4, 2014","true","30.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I'd give it a 6/10. I played enough of it to gauge how it plays, and overall it is quite an enjoyable experience. It is one of those games that you could play for hours and not even notice how the time flies. "So why not a better score?" you may ask. For a few reasons.\n\n1. The GUI\nThe menu is one of those that feels like it should be super smooth but isn't. While most of the time it is intuitive, some parts of it are very hard to inderstand, like how there is no "back" button after selecting a crewmember (or maybe I'm blind). It can also feel a bit clunky when it takes a second or two to load the Map.\n\n2. The Graphics\nYes, they're there. Yes, they're pixely. Yes, there is only one backround for big islands and one for the sea. Players want something interesting to look at while they decapitate turtles named Charlie, and a repeating forest tile isn't interesting.\n\n3. The Gameplay\nThe other stuff has been superficial, so lemme divide this a bit more:\n\na. Controlling Pirates\nIt's really wonky. There is barely any tutorialization with it (along with almost every other part of the game) and even then it sometimes doesn't do what one would want it to. If there was an actual tutorial in the game, it would fix a lot of its glaring problems.\n\nb. Areas\nThere is next to no variation. There are Pirate encounters, Island encounters, and Towns. Islands are boring and give very little gold, Pirates are either super easy or super hard---there is no middle ground, and Towns sometimes don't give you what you want (I'm still looking for the end of my Bowstrip). With more, different areas, this game would be a thousand times better.\n\nc. Sailing\nNow I know this is gonna ruffle your feathers, but I actually like the "loading" aspect of the game. It adds charm. What I do not like, however, is what takes place while sailing. Nothing. Aside from a sea shanty or the sharpening of a blade on my grindstone, nothing happens. Again, no variety. All I see is the health tick up and hunger and moral tick down. If something were to happen of if my pirates would ACTUALLY CLEAN THAT ♥♥♥♥ OFF THE ♥♥♥♥ DECK then it would be a thouroughly enjoyable experience.\n\nSo why a 6/10? The game sounds terrible! Nay, my friend, I love it. It is incredible addicting, almost a pokemon-esque type of feel. It's like I need to play, or I will die. And don't let that "time played= 4 hours" fool you. I played much more than that offline. Oh, and my ship is more beautiful than yours.\n\nIf you like rouguelikes, non-story-driven RPG's, or evenarcade games, then Pixel piracy is for you. Plus, the dev is a cool dude.\n\nTL:DR: 6/10 but could be a 10/10\n\nP.S. Alex, I know you read every review, so I'd like to say a few things. Keep up the good work, and i left a message in that chat room that you said to PM you in.

Graphically, the game is quite charming. Gameplay itself is an interesting mix of hands on and hands off. And the sandbox-esque way of creating your ship is quite lovely. The audio is a bit more of a mixed front for me than others, but all in all, positive.\n\nWhen it comes to how the game looks, Pixel Piracy is very much a retro throwback indy title. It's filled with lots of lovely blocky pixels, and really has that old school charm to it. If you are a fan of the low res, chunky looking games, the art alone just might sell Pixel Piracy to you. The only visuals that seem a bit mismatched and out of place are the sails and the sea itself. While every other bit of Pixel Piracy is nice and blocky, the sails and the water look more modern, and it can be a bit offputting.\n\nThe gameplay of Pixel Piracy is wonderful! It is an interesting merger between a god game, and a game with a bit finer tuned controls. With the exception of more absolute control over the captain of your ship, most of the sailors go about their business as they please. (Particularly if they are unhappy!) Unless you select the ship group the sailor is directly associated with, getting them to move where you want is impossible. It can be a bit frusturating at first, but it really spices up the gameplay when you're trying your best to keep newer shipmates alive during a wild brawl amid decks!\n\nPixel Piracy has the appeal that most sandbox games have. Do what you want, when you want, and the way you want. Moving up from a dinky little boat to a massive customized warship takes time, but finally getting there really feels rewarding! Building up a ship from scratch and using it to mow down lower tiered pirate ships is just a great feeling.\n\nThe audio in Pixel Piracy is the one area that may need a bit of work. The shanties are funny, but limited. The sound effects in general are quite fitting to the game, to be completely fair. The real issue is how sailors will begin to have a "conversation" onboard your ship, which basically just results in them filling your ears with "Yo ho!", "Dead men tell no tales", "Blow the man down", and "Shiver me timbers!" over and over and over again. It was funny at first, but as the game progresses it does begin to wear on you a bit.\n\nOverall Pixel Piracy is a GREAT game! Sailing around the world, sinking the ships of your unworthy foes, and conquering islands gives the game a lot of replay value.  8.5/10","December 30, 2014","true","47.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

You're crew doesn't know how to swim and drown half the time. You die to everything nearby unless you decide to travel a lot and the final bosses are hard and very far away.\n\nBUT there is hope. There is nothing more satifying than using cheat engine on this game and watch your captain slaughter an entire pirate ship and then blowing it up. I say if they give you an unfair game, play it in an unfair way. You can make crew member anything you want, maxing out thier health, but not thier damage and watch as they just tank out an entire fight.\n\nThis is a hard game to play seriously due to it's flaws, but for some laughs and pirate music, why not enjoy it?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/OmegaSyndrome/recommended/264140/","OmegaSyndrome","Unholy Symbiosis","http://steamcommunity.com/id/OmegaSyndrome/","341 products in account","I bought this game the day it came out on steam and have enjoyed it since. Don't let my low hours fool you, I play in offline mode quite a bit so go ahead and throw maybe 60+ hours onto my time.\n\nDo you like the idea of having a ridiculously named pirate captain? In charge of a swarthy band of crazed misfits as you loot and plunder the seas until your cargo bay bulges and your decks are stained with the blood of your enemies? Or how about discovering new lands and killing the inhabitants.....maybe you find treasure...maybe you barely escape by the tip of your Falcon blade. This game is all about the experience, and my god what an experience.\n\nOkay so yes the game isn't very easy to begin with for some people. I could see how you could get frustrated with the low amount of gold, tiny ship, and little to no help as far as a tutorial goes. Stick with it is all I have to say. This game has a huge amount of character and an infinate replayability that is rare by todays standards. How good is this game? I will be the first to say that this game single handedly cleansed me of my Minecraft addiction.\n\nFrom the cling and clang of blades to the strange and lovable pirate songs, this game has tons going for it. The music hands down is my favorite aspect of the game. It has incredible atmosphere and is just so well done, so polished that you will be humming the tunes for months. Grog filled tavern ballads, seagulls, waves crashing, weird pirate accents, there won't be a time in the game where you aren't immersed.\n\nThe awesome rpg like elements of raising your band of pirates can be staggering at times. You will invest in your crew and you will slowly by your hand shape and mold them into what they are. The skills you can train your pirates work on a level system, the higher the level the more efficent they become at said duties. Cleaning the decks, fishing, cooking, learning to be more hygenic, battle prowess skills.....there are even ultimate skills that cost a small fortune to obtain. So yes when a member of your crew dies in battle you will feel a sense of loss in certain ways.\n\nBuilding your own ship is one of the greatest things this game has going for it. Want a floating pile of poo? Done. Want a huge skull and crossbones? Easy. How about an intricate blimp? Difficult to manage but doable. Basically if you can think it up you can build it as your pirate ship to a certain degree. Remember this is Pixel Piracy not a 3d game, you are working on a 2d landscape with blocks and other objects. As you progress in the game you can make some truly magnificent ships that you will be proud of.\n\nEdit 1: I am inserting this edit for the sole purpose of talking about the issues with bugs and other problems. Currently this game has a ton of bugs and glitches, so many in fact that it is difficult to even begin to create a list for you. Now this edit comes after final release and several subsequent updates. You will experience bugs and glitches, no game will be free of them and I must warn and also encourage you at the same time. The developers are highly motivated to make this game the best it can be and you can help as well by becoming active on the forums by pointing out issues. These issues don't change my recommendation for purchase, the game is still highly addictive and a blast to play.\n\nI could go on and on but I won't ruin the rest of the game for you. Just ask yourself a few simple questions if you are on the fence about this purchase. Do you like Pirates? Do you like rpg like elements? Do you enjoy 2d masterpieces like terraria etc? This game is insanely fun and can easily suck hours and hours out of your life. I love this game, yep.....I love it......now all it needs is insult swordfighting and pub games.","July 28, 2014","true","37.8"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

I got it and I instantly played it for like 3 hours. Learnt the controls and what not. Its SO much fun :D! Ok. Your a pirate. Out to get 'booty', a crew, food and booty. Along the way there are problems like unhappy crew, enemies on land and water, and money shortages. This game gets a 9/10 from me. I dont know what it is but its one of those games you play for a little bit, decide to take a break in 10 minutes, but 2 hours later you havent taken your eyes off it. It has a slight repeating factor to it, but it helps it. Most of the money and food I get is from enemy ships after I plunder them. I always like starting off with a first mate, just because you arent alone in the beginning. Then I really come to like the first crew guy ( mainly because they have a low pay-requirement ) and I tend to teach them EVERYTHING. If you can manage to get to guns and cannons and having a big crew with an even bigger ship, you can make it pretty far. In all honesty, im taking my time. I have played for 10 hours but im only at pirates with lvl 4 difficulty. You learn from mistakes, and the saving system is nice. I have little complaints. I really want to catch parrots and animals and slaves, but apparently thats not a feature yet even though the provide the requirements. Thats a little pet peeve of mine I guess. Your given things you cant get to without patience. But I know those are going to be provided in later updates ( Note : It updates often ).

Each pirate you recruit, including yourself, can level up which allows you to allocate stat points on them, give them certain skills or jobs like fishing or cleaning up the ship, as well as giving each pirate a unique personality and a little bit of backstory.  There's a ton of weapons, skills, little gimmicks that you can add on to your ship to boost certain attributes or your pirates' abilities, and a lot of customization when it comes to building your ship.\n\nThe UI, menus, and the controls maybe take a little bit to get used to.  It's all cluttered and hard to figure out how to navigate through them, and it's hard to know how exactly to take off blocks and add blocks to your ship.  There's also not much explanation on items in the stores so you won't really know how skills work until you spend the gold on them and try them out.  After some time with the game, this all becomes easy to deal with.\n\nWhen you make your world, you choose what kind of history it has and what kind of pirate you'll be, and then the world is randomly generated.  Each town and island offers something different, although it starts to get a little repetitive as an island will usually just have hostile inhabitants and maybe a treasure chest.\n\nBattles are pretty difficult at times, but rewarding whenever you get an opportunity to capture a cooler ship than the one you currently have or to blow it up and gain the loot.  The game starts to get easy once you hire a bunch of pirates and level up their stats to crazy levels to where you'll almost never lose.  It does start to become a problem as there is too much crew management rather than actually playing the game, since you have to level up each individual pirate as well as equip them with the best weapons and passive items you've got.  This starts becoming time consuming once you get to a crew size over 10+ pirates, and would maybe benefit from an auto-level up and auto-equip feature.\n\nI'm happy with this game and would love to see some more updates to it with more exciting content.

Sorry I just had to get that out there. Pixel Piracy is not a horrible game, and it certainly is not abandon because they released a update on the 30th of march! The game features no totorial other that the basic controls, this does NOT help the game because people start the game, get lost in its frustrating overly-complex menus and ui, then quit and uninstall it. But if you can get passed that and learn what to do and how to properly play the game, you will have fun. Aside from that the game is buggy but the devs are working on that, so cut them some slack, if it is still super buggy after the enhanced edition is released then there is a problem. To sum things up the game was released way too early, its very hard to start off unless you look stuff up online and read the F1 help menu and it needs a little more work. But if you are looking for a fun Rougelite with pirate theme then this is what you want. I have enjoyed  this game every minute I sank in, and it is worth it if you want a RPG Pirate game.","April 4, 2015","true","4.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","2"

With great customization, you build a ship and crew to take over the pirate world. Grog in hand, you rise to become a pirate force sailing the one sea in search for even better loots. 9/10.\n\nGood—\nFun: Sail around and slaughter stuff. What more do you want, because this game might have that, too.\nCharacter Building: Don’t just dream about Amos Moses the pirate, be Amos Moses the pirate.\nRandom: The game is different every time you play. With the weekly patches, this is even more true.\n\nBad—\nRepetitive: Lack of diversity of islands, ships, and baddies. Hard to figure out what’s going on sometimes.\nGraphics: The Retro feel is nice, but things start to look same-y. Plus, the paper doll options are very ugly.\nSound: That pirate Arg was cute the first time; less than cute the 100th time.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wanteddead/recommended/264140/","wanteddead","Honest Rat","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wanteddead/","65 products in account","Major Edit:\n\nTake this from a guy who's played it for more than an hour or five.\n\nThis game is easy (Though no walk in the park), simple, repetitive and very hard to get into at first. The constant lag spikes, the annoying frequent speech patterns of the pirates, the constant cleaning of crap, INSANELY constant feeding and paying your crew, hell this game was a little hard for me to digest for a while. But I stuck it out.\n\nI found quickly, that while the game was annoying in some areas, it actually held a lot of promise. The BGM was fun to listen to, never once had to turn down my volume (Despite some other reviews said), and I actually liked the ship battles. Sure, the enemy didn't start boarding your ship until later levels and your crew constantly stood around dying or killing themselves somehow, but I felt rewarded whenever I slaughtered them (Or died trying) to the very end and reaped my reward. It was satisfactory, to me.\n\nI was expecting (And will hopefully see it in Pixel Privateers) to see sea monsters, sirens, ginormous whales and other of those awesome pirate things that one would normally expect to see in a pirate game. Yet none of which were shown (Though the brief glimpse of the sharks were annoying rather because you couldn't fight (Or fish for) them). I'd still say this game was crap because of this.\n\nBut.\n\nI actually stuck through it all, and not once did my complaints come to thought. I enjoyed the game, laughed at some of my own stupid (Gruesome) deaths and I only frowned whenever my game would crash (RARELY). The pixelated format of the game was fun, the controls were EASY to learn despite other reviews saying otherwise, the UI was alright AND you can turn off bloom (Which is a great way to reduce lag). The witty shanties that the pirates sang onboard or in the bars were fun to listen to, the interesting conversations that would go on ("I knew a pirate like you" "I got a jar of dirt!") and of course my all time favorite Pixel Pirate moments... flag and ship editing. I loved the hell out of both of those things, never have I ever been able to design a ship that would sail (No, not even in Sid Meyer's Pirates was I able to do this (Even though it is an older game)). And my flag (Which was usually a Terraria reference) was fun. Yeah, I disliked the limited color choices, and the small space for the drawing board, but it was still creative.\n\nReally. I hated a lot about this game, but I loved it all the same.\n\nSo, for all of the liked and disliked features of the game... I'd still have tor reccomend it, hell screw if it's on sail or not. Try the game out for yourself, I did and I wasn't as disappointed as I thought I'd be.\n\nIn fairness.\n\nI'd give this game a solid 7/10.\n\n(I wonder if they'll add multiplayer in Pixel Privateers?)","February 17, 2015","true","61.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/KansaiBene/recommended/264140/","KansaiBene","Tycho Brohe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/KansaiBene/","76 products in account","I really wanted to like this game.  I watched a few Let's Plays from when it was in Early Access and thought it looked like a lot of fun, which it can be at times.  I mean, you get to enlist your own pirate crew!  You can travel around, searching for treasure, fishing, getting scurvy and watching your pirate crew poop all over your boat!  What could be better?!\n\nHowever, I soon discovered that the finished product is just as unfinished as that Early Access alpha footage was.  Gamebreaking glitches and a poor UI plague you at every turn.  Sometimes, your pirate just decides to fall into the water and die.   You can give your pirates a bunch of different skills, but only the most recent one actually has any effect, leaving many players to wonder "why doesn't my fisherman actually fish?"\nThe developer is promising a new "enhanced edition" free update, however all of the official word on this update indicate that bug fixes aren't even on their radar.  They are treating the game as though it is basically finished but just needs some balance tweaks, when the truth of the matter is this game should still be on the Early Access list.   The phrase "buyer beware" has never been more applicable.\n\nIf you don't mind paying for unfinished products, don't mind when a developer lists their product as finished when it is still very much in alpha stages and ridden with glitches, then you might still want to try this game.\nIf you are of the opinion that a little bit of faith in indie devs is warranted, then you will probably be willing to buy this.\n\nBut take my advice, wait for this game to go on sale.  It absolutely is not worth the full price, unless you have really low standards for games.  Even then, it's not really a good idea to throw money at devs who display no indications of understanding what their game's problems actually are.  The industry has enough of that already.\n\nUPDATE:  A few months back, the lead developer of Pixel Piracy posted a public apology for the state of the game.  In this apology, he admitted that Pixel Piracy was not in a finished state, that they weren't happy with it, and they would be addressing the numerous legitimate complaints that had been expressed.\nHowever, there is no record of this public apology on Steam anymore.  They have also appointed a new moderator to their subforum, and this moderator is insisting that the game is a finished product and that the developers are working on a new title.\n\nTHESE DEVELOPERS COULD NOT BE BIGGER LIARS.  DO NOT SUPPORT THEM.  THEY HAVE ABUSED EARLY ACCESS, AND LIED TO THEIR CUSTOMERS REPEATEDLY.  THEY MAKE MONEY BY GENERATING HYPE, AND GOING BACK ON PROMISES.  DO NOT FALL FOR THEIR SCAMS.","January 19, 2015","false","10.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The game is great and all that but...\n\n\n\n\nGive me better control over customization you fools. You give me the ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥ tease with these hair options and clothing and I have to sit there for 6 hours beating my ♥♥♥♥ against the "Color" button and getting progressively more flacid. And now that I got my ♥♥♥♥ing hair to look pretty so I can go out with all the cute pirate boys, now I got to beat my micropenis against the voice button for another 6 hours so I can have a voice that doesn't sound like a chipmunk getting its nuts imploding on themselves from all this blue balling.\n\nSo great. You made Captain Dinkle ♥♥♥♥ McGarry Poon and are ready to go on a date with your cute pirate boyfriend(s). Guess what dummy. Apparantly you're a fat dumb♥♥♥♥ that was once a computer analyst. It says it right there. With your silly little boy stats. I mean you don't look any diffrent from any other little cute baby boy pirates but none the same, you feel cheated. You worked hard at your local LA Fitness/YMCA/Jewish Sports Club or whatever to get those toned buttcheeks so you could sell your sweet ♥♥♥ on the streat for some spending money.\n\nSo the cycle continues.\n\nAfter about 20 hours in you get your cute tiny pootie batootie looking like he's a real ♥♥♥ man, and apparantly he's been heading to the gym sinces he's muscular as ♥♥♥♥ and is a handsome rouge (Also worked part time at a BK but mother ♥♥♥♥er there is no ♥♥♥♥ing way I'm doing this ♥♥♥♥ for a 1000th time).\n\nYou set off.\n\n...And die because your ♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥ thought it would be cool to take on the local population of a small island. To ♥♥♥♥ing bad they're some jacked up zulu warrior who has a special intrest in ♥♥♥♥ing people in the ♥♥♥ with his 10ft spear. Tough ♥♥♥♥ you reload your stupid ♥♥♥ back.\n\nDon't ♥♥♥♥ with the zulus yet, kill some homeless guy in a canoe, hire your first mate, decide to ♥♥♥♥ up those zulu ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥s, first mate dies but zulu bulus are dead, ♥♥♥♥ that first mate guy anyway he was ugly af.\n\nFast forward a few hours and you're on you're big ♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ing up ♥♥♥ like you where forged in the hot forges of Zeus' ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and having a good time.\n\nNow you got to wait for the next update in about 3 years. Ha ♥♥♥♥ you ♥♥♥♥ you ♥♥♥♥ you.","October 19, 2015","true","48.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"
