I enjoyed it, despite a feeling that it was grindy and slow toward the end. I enjoyed it enough that I bought the deluxe edition of #2 immediately when I saw it, without a second thought.\n\nThe depth is improved, but I did not enjoy the game overall.\n\nMain faults:\n\n- Applying conditions is combat is not rewarding. Enemies (and your own characters, for that matter) have a high base chance to entirely negate a condition every single round. There is no way to impact that chance at all.\n- Compounding the above, there is a whole set of items,  accessories, and skills that center around conditions that are consequently also not rewarding.\n- Difficulty is under-tuned. You'll outpace the level of your enemies very quickly and are unlikely to fall behind unless you eschew side quests completely.\n- Nothing to spend gold on - Stores only stock "common" items and enchantment scrolls, item progression caps out early-mid game. Soon you'll be drowning in gold with maxed out items, spending all your money on XP shrooms in a desperate bid to see if there's just one more tier of stuff to buy\n- Dungeons barely vary from regular gameplay, if you have scarab of energy + cleric you won't even notice the inability to rest, but the cheap and plentiful consumables will also see you through.\n- Area based "investigation" for extra items is excruciatingly boring.\n- Bland. KoPaP 1 had chunks in it. Hard encounters that forced you to find more effective party and item builds, in order to defeat them.\n\nHere's what's good:\n\n- The humour of the writing and sheer quantity of geek references scattered through the game\n\nEDIT: I toned down my review a little after trying +1 to remember what I liked and disliked. In many ways KoPaP 2 is an improvement, it's just let down by a lack of any interesting challenges to drive the rest of the gameplay.","October 22, 2015","false","10.5"," 165 of 204 people (81%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","81","165","204","6","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SilvaOfWind/recommended/310060/","SilvaOfWind","Silva","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SilvaOfWind/","338 products in account","It is games like this one that make me really wish Steam allowed "thumb sideways" reviews. Knights of Pen and Paper 2 is not quite a bad game; for all it's flaws, it has a solid core. However, what flaws it does have are fairly substantial ones that make any recommendation come with an asterisk at the end.\n\nThe Good:\nThe sprite work is vastly improved over the first game. Backgrounds, player sprites, and enemy sprites have substantially more detail. The animations are also better and more creative: one enemy's attacks result in it breathing vowels, for example.\nThe addition of a crafting system adds some depth to otherwise routine inventory and equipment management decisions.\nThe class variety of the game is decent considering its limited scope. Class abilities are distinct.\nBattles have some degree of strategy.\n\nThe Bad:\nAs in the first game, quest variety remains functionally nonexistent. "Travel here" and "fight these things". Get used to those concepts, because they are all you will be doing in the game. Far as I could see, there were less than a handful of exceptions: a  quest that tasks you with solving a murder mystery (through one of three options) and a disguised account creation prompt were the only ones I noticed. It's possible I missed some, but the proportion of time you will actually be doing anything interesting remains dreadfully low.\nAlthough the game has decent class variety for such a small-scope title, there is no incentive to experiment with party structure because of how battles decide everything in the game. After you fill out your initial five person party, get used to that setup. If you want to change it, you theoretically can... As long as you consent to make an already extremely repetitive game even more so by playing catchup.\nThe sheer repetition of the first game was (arguably) its greatest flaw. The second is, unfortunately, not any better in that regard. Lack of quest variety, mentioned above, is only a small cog in a great machine of repetition. What you see in the first five minutes of the game is functionally what you get for all of it, and it can and does feel like a chore at times.\nThe amount of equipment available ceases to improve long before endgame.\nPlenty of blank slots in the game room customization. I figured I would unlock them over time... No, they just do not exist. Given the game hints at further DLC down the line, I expect them to be part of that.\nNeither:\nThe improved sprite work comes at a cost. Many enemy types are visibly altered from the same base sprite. Thieves, troglodytes, cavemen, and others share a base. They are altered enough that this isn't a huge deal or necessarily "laziness" so much as being resourceful, and the actually unique enemies make up for it. Still, it is worth pointing out.\nThe story of the game remains extremely limited and basic.\nNonexistent replay value is hard to quantify as positive or negative, since whether an RPG has any tends to be a coin flip.\nSo in the end, do I recommend this game? For most people, no. A decent battle system, in most circumstances, is not enough to save a heavily flawed game, especially if that battle system is almost everything the game offers. Games do not exist in a vacuum, and no matter who you are chances are there are more enjoyable and less repetitive ones out there. If all you wanted, however, was for Knights of Pen and Paper to have a sequel... Well, this game certainly is that, and in that case, more power to you.","October 27, 2015","false","9.8"," 70 of 85 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","70","85","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/angrykobold/recommended/310060/","angrykobold","AngryKobold","http://steamcommunity.com/id/angrykobold/","56 products in account","So, let me preface this with the fact that this is a very short game. It took me about 10 hours to complete, and that is with creating 2 parties first before settling on my 3rd and favorite party (so far) which I completed the main storyline and DLC content with.\n\nNow that I have that out of the way, let's discuss the game itself. KoPP2 is the successor to the original game (if that somehow wasn't obvious.) It borrows the base mechanics from its predecessor, but expands quite a bit. Each character now has 3 primary governing stats, Mind, Body, and Senses. You often make party based stat rolls (d20 based, of course) out of combat. As part of this system, each player, class, and race (there are races now, cool, right???) contributes towards the stat scores.\n\nThe gear system is a significant upgrade from the original, allowing actual crafting rather than buying unending grindstones and improving existing gear. There is also a much broader variety of gear, allowing you to outfit each character to your liking.\n\nNow, for the only "negative" I have for this game. This game will never be hugely popular, unfortunately, and that is due to the simple fact that the target audience is pretty small compared to that of other video games. It is marketed at tabletop gamers who are ALSO fans of lighthearted comedic games.  **If you don't play tabletop roleplaying games, you will not get many of the jokes.**\n\nOverall, dispite the disappointing length (made up for by the replayability brought by experimenting with different party make-ups) I'd highy recommend this game.\n\n8/9 out of 10.","December 17, 2015","true","53.9"," 46 of 53 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","46","53","0","0"

If you liked the first game, you'll probably enjoy this game for about two hours. But after a certain point if you pay any real attention to your characters, it quickly becomes a disgusting stomp-fest for the entirety of the rest of the -very short- game. I got to the final boss and just kind of stared at the screen waiting for it to tell me that it wasn't actually over, as it happened in the first one, only for the credits to roll and end the game. Ultimately this game feels way less fulfilling than the first, and I don't think it's really worth the money. I would've given this a positive recommendation if it was even close to the length of the first. This feels like less of a sequel and more of an expansion.\n\nEDIT: Decided to go a bit more indepth in my review after thinking on it a bit.\n\nGood:\n-Funny, just like the first. Lots of jokes, although some are very repetitive.\n-Good fun for about two hours, until you start reaching various caps and it quickly becomes very tedious and dull.\n-Yeah that's pretty much it, aside from "nostalgia" for the first game, nothing unique about this game stands out.\n\nBad:\n-Crafting is almost pointless. The only large use for it is "enchanting" gear, which is very minimal and caps out at +3 total very quickly. In addition, you get very few crafting recipes, most of which are for very basic consumables.\n-Item purchases cap out very quickly as well. I had reached my maximm possible purchasable items well before halfway into the game, and I kept waiting for more to unlock but sadly none ever did.\n-Going back to crafting, it heavily favors the melee characters, since you can't really boost trinkets, and the only available +spellpower weapon was an already enchanted staff. Meanwhile you can enchant melee weapons to the nines and deal truckloads of damage. I gave my paladin some huge +3 weapons and he just started one-shotting things.\n-"Unique" items end up being much worse than crafted ones, therefore making it almost better to sell any interesting items. Like the three-handed sword. I enchanted a +3 waraxe and it had significantly better stats than an Item I had just gotten at the same level, and for 1 hand less requirement. I ended up selling almost every unique item I received, including most of the debuff-immunity ones due to the fact that most of the time debuffs will simply fall off your characters without accomplishing much.\n-Very repetitive. While the first game was bad about this as well, the "grinding" of that game had some kind of purpose. Hunting for grindstones and whatnot was necessary unless you paid $$. In this game by the end you just end up walking halfway cross the map and back repeatedly, and when you get there killing maybe 2-3 waves of monsters, repeat.\n-Unbelievably short game. I have about a 90% completion on this game, I went out of my way to do most of the side quests, and it only took me 6.5 hours to complete. I doubt I'd get much more than an hour more out of doing the little remaining content, maybe an additional half hour on that if I fork over the additional 4.99 in-game dlc.\n-No seriously, I cannot stress enough how short this game is. KoPaP 1 was fairly long for that type of game, and you went significantly higher in levels. At the beginning of the game you see a level 99 character, and I figured that would be close to what endgame looked like. Instead, you pretty much finish the game at level 20, possibly earlier if you skip side quests. This was an extreme let down.\n-Classes, while interesting, require very little in terms of creation. Most of the classes you can be well served simply by levelling 1 or 2 of their skills and all but ignoring the others. I never put more than 1 rank into about 75% of the skills and just capped others with impunity, especially all the "affect adjacent" ones combined with the gameroom item to make them effect all.\n-In addition, I never could find a retraining system to try and re-work my characters if I wanted to test out diferent builds, so short of starting up a new game I just had to stick with my decisions.\n-Severe lack of gameroom items. In the first one you almost had too many options, this time when you open up to buy gameroom items and you see only 2 or 3 in each section (with 5 slots "open") it's an immediate let-down.\n\nAll in all, this feels like a game only half-finished and just tossed out for some quick fan-cash. They had enough name-recognition to get people to buy it, and decided to use that to just coast on a barely completed product. I didn't personally encounter any bugs, but I heard there were a great deal when the game first released, and that only makes me more sure that this product is yet another in the current trend of "finish half the game, and then sell the rest of it as DLC."\n\nI would not recommend this to anyone, not even fans of the original.","November 5, 2015","false","6.5"," 39 of 50 people (78%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","78","39","50","2","0"

Of course the basic gameplay and straightforward design are things to consider when choosing whether this is the kind of game you'd want to buy.\n\nI got Knights of Pen and Paper 2 for 5$ and, for that price, it was decent and mostly enjoable: if you liked the first game and a slightly advanced version then this'll be a good purchase, provided you don't mind its simplicity and blemishes.","October 23, 2015","true","9.5"," 20 of 23 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","20","23","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dragnix/recommended/310060/","Dragnix","{FITH}™Dragnix","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dragnix/","743 products in account","Summary:\nFans of Dungeons and Dragons campaigns along with connoisseurs of popular media will enjoy this more casual style RPG, that has a little bit of depth hidden in its content. The creators obviously have a love of all things movies, gaming, and the like, but does the subject content well with timeliness of jokes. Some of the humor is groan inducing, but it's done in a lighthearted way that really connects. While the RPG elements are somewhat basic compared to others in the genre, it does have surprising depth with the status system in question and takes good use of the influence of tabletop RPG mechanics. Even after 4 hours of gameplay, I will still engaged, which is a good sign from a game that does have unlockables and replayability to go along with it. The difficulty curve may be less then I would want, however this is mostly due to doing every side quest, and when skipping those, the game presented more of the challenge. The real thing that holds it back in the end is the UI and lack of options. After a while, you'll be wishing to fast forward through animations and pick up the pace of the game after you've seen a cutscene before (on a restart for example). In the end, found it definitely worth the price of admission thanks to the combo of combat options along with the humor. Definitely worth your time.\n\nGameplay Footage and Video Review: https://youtu.be/0s2XXlzyDrE\n\nLists:\n+:\nReally goofy sense of humor that pays respect to popular media of video games, movies, and the like before it. It may be specifically hitting the right bones in my body for this, but it definitely hit home with my sense of humor.\nCombat system is simple, but does have complexities under the surface that do help bring it some variety over the long haul.\nThreat system works well for those who choose to pay close attention to it.\nThe pixel artstyle does well for the world, but it's more so the different environments and styles it takes you to. Going to fallout's vaults only to later go to an ASCII dungeon still works in this world, and makes you appreciate the time and effort that went into each and every environment.\nLove the blending of real world elements into the world, and the play on the idea of 1st versus second edition that it goes for, almost to the point of parody. Good use of story elements and making game play variation make sense in the world.\nGood use of unlocks and timeliness to help bring new characters and items into the mix, making you wonder how you can use them.\nGrinding not necessary, as even with little side quests done, you can still use strategy to get through fights. Fights also don't feel grindy like other games, even if you do face the same enemies in a row a couple of times.\n-:\nUI has clunky implementation at times, where selection of enemies and items are too close to each other, leading to the wrong decision. Simple click based responses would have helped this in various cases.\nThere's improvements that can be made of the long hall, like being able to buy multiple items at once. Options to speed up the game at certain points by disabling animations would help replayability and not having it turn into a spacebar/clickfest.\nGame can get a little too easy at times if you do a lot of the side quests.\nSorta wish gold didn't carry over to other games, it can make the game a little bit too easy in those cases.","October 23, 2015","true","5.0"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","78","14","18","3","0"

If the Deluxe version was priced at the regular version then it would be no question. Alot of similar mechanics as the previous installment, with crafting added. Oh, and you can't just go anywhere right from the get go, you have to unlock each location through quests and the story line.\n\n6/10\n\nDetailed Review\nI am a huge fan of the first one, had it on mobile the instant I found it, and then bought the +1 Edition through Steam. With this in mind, I did not expect huge things from the second one, possibly some new mechanics, an interesting story line, and a just different enough feel that it wouldn't just be a "recycled" game.\n\nWhich is mostly true.\n\nGameplay\n\nThe game plays almost the exact same as the first one. You pick your starting characters, with the difference being you can also choose from three races at the beginning, which add passive dice bonuses in three categories. The three categories are Body, Agility, and Mind. Body powering strength and health, Agility powering critical hit rates, accuracy and speed, and Mind powering the strength of your spells, and how much mana you have. All of the classes use mana, while for warrior and thieves it powers abilities instead of traditional spells.\n\nThe different classes will also add bonus passives to some or all of the dice, for example, the Warrior class adds to the Body die, but nothing else, while the Ninja class (which you unlock later in the game) adds mostly to Agility, but a little to Body and Mind as well.\n\nDifferent classes include Warrior, Paladin, Thief, Cleric, and Wizard. There are others that you unlock with game progression. The classes are based on traditional roles, such as the Warrior being a hard hitting tanky dude, and the Thief being a sneaky backstabber, and so on.\n\nEach base character that you choose to fill a role will add small passives, such as the Jock adding an extra "hand" slot. Really it is a matter of experimentation to find the best Base/Race/Class combo to suit your needs and play style.\n\nLeveling up works like it did before, with gaining a single skill point to invest, and getting a small boost to health and mana. The skills for each class is pretty much what you would expect from the class type, like the Thief being able to use stealth to sneak up and deal massive first hit damage, and the Paladin to gain aggro and heal others, and so on.\n\nLater on you are able to add to your first three characters, up to a total of five. This costs gold, the ingame currency, and ramps up quickly. Gold is used in every aspect of gameplay, from buying weapons and items, to paying for crafting, and for adding the items to the "play room". The play room can have items added to it in order to provide bonuses to the gameplay, such as extra experience, gold, treasure, etc.\n\nGraphics\n\nGraphics look almost the same, with slightly higher quality to the models and envrionment. Not a huge topic here.\n\nMusic and Sound\n\nI found the music to be just average, nothing to write home about. The sound effects on hitting mobs and using spells sound rather recycled, but what would you really expect from a game that is intentionally made to feel like it is from the early 90's?\n\nReplayability\n\nThis is probably the single worst factor about this game, as I don't know if there is a New Game + or anything like that. If there is, I haven't found it. Basically, as of right now, once you finish the side quests and the story, it seems to be done.\n\nVerdict\nDecent. 6/10\n\nSomethings could have been done better, such as a New Game + mode, possibly making the play room items cheaper, and adding more random quests. All in all, it won't feel like you wasted your time, but I would wait until the game is on sale before picking it up.\n\nI DO recommend this game, IF it is on sale.","October 25, 2015","true","28.8"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

I've also underlined more important points in my review, so you could read those and get the gist of my whole review, I think.\n\nThis Review(You can skip this if you want, it's not the important part of the review)\n\nI am going to do something different than the traditional “pros and cons” reviews as well as the “numeric” reviews, because I think that I want to show something else with my reviews. I want to talk about the actual experience of the game itself more than just elements of the game. I, as a reviewer, don’t want to isolate myself from you (the person reading my review). I want to speak more about the experience that I’ve had with the game and what I thought might be valuable to someone who is wondering what they will experience when they play the game. I think that is much more organic and maybe other people might enjoy this review.\n\nIntroductory ThoughtsThis game is a great way to sort of “wait” or “kill time” to wait for other big titles that you’re waiting to spend your money on. I mean, the game is rife with humor and references to the outside world, and you might have some experiences worth remembering, but it retains a lot of elements of Knights of Pen and Paper 1 (I will abbreviate the name of the game as KOPAP, because there is a character limit on reviews). It isn't to say "this game isn't worth your time," but I would say do a little bit of looking around if you are wary. And on this same note, this game does bring some new mechanics in that are worth mentioning, and I will get to that later.\n\nThe Price and Time\nWell, I just finished the main questline and I did get sidetracked somewhat, but it took me ~10 hours to complete. Along the way I met some odd characters, enemies, encounters, and all manner of strange things. I think it definitely has a story to it that's interesting. You have to put all the pieces together as you go along, but it’s interesting. I bought the game for $3.19, I think. So It isn’t overpriced at all. (The standard price for indie games nowadays seems to be $14.99 or so.) The DLC was $1.99 whenever I bought it, I think, and it added some extra content that I am going to play through. I would recommend buying it when it’s on sale, because it is $7.99 as its standard price, and while I don’t mean to imply that it isn’t worth that price, I would say to people who haven’t played KOPAP1 to watch videos of KOPAP2 before you jump right into it. You can absolutely jump into KOPAP2 and you won’t be missing much,  but if you’re considering buying it, I would strongly recommend watching videos, and reading other reviews.\n\nMy Experience:\nI’ve already mentioned that it took me approximately 10 hours to complete the campaign (while getting sidetracked). (Sidenote: I usually compare the amount of money I paid for the game to the amount of hours played, and if the hours is greater than the money, and I also feel gratified with my experience, then I usually like the game because I can walk away from it knowing it was a good investment.) It may seem repetitive at times, but there are things that do give it much more freshness (I’ll get into this in a bit). The fighting mechanic is a fairly standard turn based mechanic, but it’s based on something called “Initiative,” which you will find out in the game. The exploration mechanic is much like Knights of Pen and Paper 1. You travel from place to place with a fee of 5 gold, which ends up being negligible in the later game. The quests are standard as well; there isn’t much variation in the quest types, but the story is what made it interesting, to me.\n\n\nThe New Mechanics and Graphics Update\nThere were a few things that were of note that brought a certain freshness to KOPAP2 that weren't present in KOPAP1. I'll list them, because I've already had enough paragraphs.\nInvestigation- this mechanic added an ability where you can spend gold and find "clues" to unlock chests in certain locations and find certain items that can help you along your way, information that can help you with recipies, and other things I might be forgetting.\nDungeons - This is a huge mechanic which I really won't go in to depth about, but it puts dungeons in the game, and it reminds me somewhat of the old game Nethack. You explore a dungeon, and descend, and find a boss, basically.\nGraphics Update - People might be wondering why I'm including this in here. Well, if you look at KOPAP1 against KOPAP2, there's a HUGE upgrade with the visual appeal. I much prefer the graphics of this game over KOPAP1. I thought this did add a lot to the game as well.\nConclusion/tl;drKnights of Pen and Paper 2 was and still is a fun game for me. It had memorable references, whether they are modern or not. The characters were ridiculous and serious. The game as a whole was an enjoyable experience for me. If you're more focused on mechanics, I would say take a look at the game before buying it, because this game is really driven by the story. As I say in all my reviews:\n\nDon't take my word for it. Go look at videos, other reviews of this game, and maybe buy it. I hope you have fun, and thank you for taking the time to read my review.","April 2","true","17.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Sort of..\n\nThe first KoPP (+1) was amazing. Yes there were some annoyances from it (like the damn horse noise in travel!!) but otherwise it was very fun! The games humor was spot on and it really made the game worth every second. Sadly in this, KoPP 2, I don't see it. It lacks.. It tries and tries, but never really gets your funny bone... At all. Specifically by the point where it used the same joke for the 8th time.\n\nI'm also somewhat dissapointed at the lack of choosable players (as characters) and races and classes..\n\nPlayers: There were a LOAD of these in the first game.. Why couldn't they have simply carried some of them across? It's not like they were game breaking 0.o\n\nRaces: There are 3, and I find myself choosing Elf almost 100% of the time. Why not create 3 more races and give each race a total +2 bonus across the 3 stats... More options is more variety is more fun. I think it would take little effort to create 3 additional races..\n\nClasses: Where did they go? I'm sure there were more in the first one.. I think I had to get 50% of the way through the game to come across a new class that I liked so there was my 5th player... I WAS waiting to get something more magic based, as that's what I prefer, so I held out for ages only to find there was nothing coming.. Very dissapointed with this sadly to say.\n\nThe gameplay is a little repatitive... Actually a lot... The first is similar, but it was a first time attempt so again in this I was hoping for a little more. Perhaps a little weather, or heaven forbid the trees sway or something.. Each area has different art, but that's it. I find it all very grindy but with nothing dangling infront of me to entertain the outcome of said grinding.. It's grinding for nothing.. I'm fairly sure that has and never will be a successful use of my time.\n\nSad to say that I cannot recommend this game in it's state at all. It's just very very boring. It was boring from about the 4 hour mark, but I kept going hoping that it became as fun as the first.

I did everything, including the "DLC" and I wasn't satisfied at all.\n\nLet me give you this breakdown:\n\n*Crafting: I am not a fan of crafting at all in videogames, and this one wasn't an exception. You can craft some items and enchant items, but the enchanting is underwhelming, since you can make an item either +1 or +2 or +3, no special bonuses or making them powerful afterwards. Any unique items you find on the field won't be better than your enchanted items. Also, I got the feeling crafting was added, since all other games have crafting.\n\n*Quests: This goes for both main story and side quests. ALL of them are either "Go to that place and fetch this" or "Kill X number of monsters". There is only one variety, and that is a "mystery" quest, where you "investigate" a place and of course by "investigating", I mean click those options and see what happens. Yeah, the first game had the first two, but here, to the sequel of that game, I was expecting more variety, more quests, bigger, longer, better. But no, we got nothing.\n\n*Gold: I wasn't sure how to write it down, but another thing you will face toward the end, is you have nowhere to spend gold. I got all availible Game Room items (by the time I write this, BTW), I crafted and enchanted a good gear and everything from the two Magazines, including the 4.99 "DLC" and Monk, and then you get more gold and there is nothing you will spend it on. At the end of the main story + "DLC", I had over 2000 gold and they were sitting over there.\n\n*Conditions: The worst part of the combat of this game. Attacks can cause stun, confusion, bleeding, burning, poison etc status effects, but 99% of the times they work against you, since the enemies will get rid of it either immediately or at the beginning of the turn with a save roll. Also, in some places you have special conditions that also work against you, like in Big Town the special effect is MOB and each round there is a 25% chance a Thief will appear as your enemy. Or in the Tower of Broken Balance, the effect there called Broken Balance, the enemies do +25% damage, while you do -25% damage. They are useless and against the player. Also, how can someone achieve Sudden Death at all, when all everything you cast are gone almost immediately.\n\n*Length: It's an extremely short game. My play time, that is I was sitting and playing, should be lower than what Steam says, due to some RL stuff I was doing. And if you don't do the "DLC" quests, your play time will be even shorter. And the places you explore are fewer than the first game. The only thing it might add some time are the investigations you can do in each area, but those can be done in 1 minute. And they add nothing, since they are either items you can buy from the stores, or some unique items you won't use or recipes for items you won't make at all.\n\nI will say the writing is good, with some good jokes but it won't save it from being a subpar from the first game. And I see they will release DLCs in the future, but after I beat 100% of the availibt content, I won't return back to it.","January 2","false","11.5"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

I have no secrets nor missions left in my game and my characters are between level 34 and 36.\n\nThe crafting system is uninteresting and too restrictive. I have not found any recipies that were not on a secret or built in from the beginning, so it would seem that there are nothing to discover here.\n\nOnce you realize what is the optimal build, then save for a few secret weapons, there are only a very few ways to setup your characters, which are optimal.\n\nAll this would be ok, if it wasn't for the unskipable battles. When I'm level 35, I shouldn't be stopped by a level 2 monster group, which takes me about 1-2 minutes to kill, thus wasting my time gaining 5xp and a few coins. When you want to make sure that you haven't missed anything or you want to perform a quest traveling. You shouldn't have to waste your time every time you need to travel more than 3-5 roads.\nThis will happen about 5-7 times per quest. Making me feel very frustrated, when I just want to get on with the quest.\n\nI had some fun, but ultimately this game became a chore when I wanted to make sure I didn't have to start over again.","November 12, 2015","false","11.1"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","7","12","0","0"

To summarise: pretty much the same as the first game, some nice added stuff, some things taken away, some improvements and some things worse. Kinda short but still worth the price for the silly fourth-wall-breaking humour.\n\n\nThe game is very much the same as the first game but with a few tweaks. The game is mostly improved, especially the dungeon layout and the addition of little features such as choices in quests and secrets discovered only by rolling a 20 during travel.  However, it feels shorter and not as challenging, and I miss some of the features that were taken out, such as a choice of GM, the in-house pets and being able to have a space alien as a player choice.\n\nThe general theme is that you are playing as a bunch of tabletop roleplayers and their characters at the same time. You can see your room and customise it (with the same money as you spend in the game world, for some reason) while also seeing the adventure as it happens. The monsters and NPCs break the fourth wall constantly and everyone is aware they are in a computer game, despite it meaning to be a simulation of a tabletop game.  The complete lack of fourth wall makes it very light-hearted. However, the game is sometimes very insightful about gaming ethics.\n","April 7","true","11.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The system works like this: substract the stat for which you have to roll from 20 and you get your target number, e.g. you have 9 Body and roll for weakness, you have to roll 11+ to be successful. If you suffer any malus on the roll, you substract it from the appropriate stat, e.g. body roll -6 for a character with 9 body would result in a final stat of 3 giving a target number of 17+.\n\nGood, now you know how this works. Why am I bummed out? Because your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ useless freaks keep rolling 1-5  constantly  while your enemies get one 20 after another! How do I know this? When your enemy has 10 body, 7 senses and 6 mind and is faced with the "judgement" skill from my high level cleric, this is what happens all the time:\nJudgement lets you roll, once for each stat, you fail, you get hit,  but  my cleric has so many skill points, he applies a -6 penalty to each roll.  For this enemy, the target numbers would be as follows: 16+ for body; 19+ for senses and a straight natural 20 for mind. Statistically speaking, it would be a miracle (or anathema, depends on your POV) for such enemies to constantly succeed more than one saving throw right?\nNope, not in this game. 80% of the time you can be happy, that your enemies get hit even ONCE. And that skill even is a vulnerability of the said enemy. Whiskey Tango Foxtrot?\nYour Warrior, on the other hand, has 9 body and needs to roll unmodified to get rid of weakness, so 11+ is the TN.\nNedless to say, that in 80% of all cases he never managed to remove the weakness by himself until the fight ended.\nEssentially, statistically speaking, the random number gen is perfect, because on the average, all rolls are equally distributed between high and low... except that the enemies keep hogging all the high rolls while you get the 1-12s.\n\nSorry, but this is no fun, and the RNG simply made the game a mess and the longer I played, the more angry it made me, because I dumped skillpoints into skills, which mathematically made sense to have, but enemies keep resisting even if they are reduced to zero stats due to attached penalties in said skills. In the end you will find that damage is the only thing to go for, even critical is super-useless as my warrior with 9% crit get as many crits as my rogue with 54% chance to crit. Get your dirt together paradox, there are so many statistical and mathematical applications to avoid exactly this, which are not even that hard to program.","February 8","false","19.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Like the first game this one starts out on the path to being a real good game and the early returns likely lead to a number of people waxing poetic about it after a few hours. I too in the beginning was thinking it was pretty good game but I just completely lost interest at about the five to six hour mark. Everything after that point been a grind that just does not seem to have any kind of a reward making it worth completing.\n\nI think the game starts off well and introduces some slight tweaks to the systems found in the original. One of the big changes and subsequently huge letdowns here was the crafting system. I was initially excited about the prospect of being able to tune your equipment and craft items but the whole mechanic turned out to be really really really simplistic. Most of the time the necessary elements to forge a new weapon are all located in the shop of the same town you crafting in.  As a quick breakdown of how it works:\n\nFrom Town Screen:\nOpen Crafting Menu-\nRead a Recipe and Identify Components needed to complete\nBack out of Crafting Menu\nOpen Shop Menu\nPurchase Components\nBack to the Crafting Menu\nClick on Components Pay 5 Gold and.....\nSUCCESS!\n\nI mean I get the game is suppose to be accessable but...just....no... just no. The only skill or strategy necessary to complete the above would be remembering the components from the time it takes you to back out of a menu and open another one. The recipes themselves are located primarily (maybe entirely) through "Investigating". This entails paying gold to roll the dice and investigate different points along the map.  Enough high numbers stack up over several rolls and you uncover some sort of prize. There are other things to be turned up through this pay for a dice roll mechanic but none of it was of any use I could find. While I did not hate this portion of the game as much as the crafting I found it lackluster as well. Now that I think about it the only real difference between "investigate" and "crafting" are that the former has an element of chance and less menu navigation.\n\nI enjoyed first Knights of Pen and Paper for a solid block of time and I would probably recommend it especially on sale. However it was also difficult to finish. In that game I got to the point of having my party and item upgrades more or less completed strategy wise and was situatuated about the same strategy-wise from about hour 10 to completion.  I did push through and eventually completed the game but I was entirely on autopilot after that point. This version started off stronger but finished or at least flatlined for me much quicker. I am not sure if this game was rushed to the finish line or not but it feels like it would have benefited from some more time in the oven.\n\nOften we all enjoy games for different reasons. For me the portions of this game and the first one I enjoyed were that you had the ability to upgrade various aspects of the game (characters, items, room improvments, various other buffs) to your own liking. For my enjoyment the critical fault of this game is that you have very limited options to upgrade different aspects. The first game offered more customized options for upgrades and about the same level of depth as you will find here.\n\nI did not care for the story and tone of the game personally, Both are very light and though the humor missed the mark I appreciate it being included. Neither really downgraded my experience much because after I realized I was not getting much out of reading through the story I wound up skim/skipping through the dialouge bits. I do give them a plus one for making the option to speed click through that portion of the game.\n\nOverall I was underwhelmed and pretty disappointed as I saw this game as the creators chance to fine-tune the experience I got out of the first 12-16 hours of the first game.  Instead I got the same letdown in less than half the time.\n\n4/10","October 24, 2015","false","10.4"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","4","7","0","0"

Despite being a bit repetitive at times it still had a variety of gameplay options that you could experiment with. That said, I really felt like KoPaP 2 fell a bit short on this part.\n\nThere are:\n- only three unlockable classes, one of which you unlock only right before the end\n- about 2-3 options for each game room upgrade\n- which leads to sidequests that barely give any rewards more than XP and gold\n- a crafting system that I barely needed to use and has few recipes. I feel they could have vastly improved both crafting and quests by, for example, rewarding recipes and/or rare ingredients here\n- a limited assortment of items that are all very similar\n- personally, I did not like the enemies very much. There is a seemingly huge number of glitches and bugs that you have to fight along the storyline. I really liked the tabletop rpg atmosphere and it feels a bit too 'glitchy' this time around\n\nIt is not a bad game though and I enjoyed playing it. It has a lot to offer, such as much improved sprites and graphics from the first game. The dialogue is still hilarious and there are is way more content to come via DLC, but I would not recommend buying it right away. As of yet it is a pretty but somewhat slim version of KoPaP +1.","November 3, 2015","false","7.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

As soon as I returned to the game to give it a bit more play I realized there wasn't really much more advancement to be had. I expected a +1 version where I could play the whole campaign over again with my currently leveled characters, but it turns out all you can do is finish uncompleted side quests...boring. And that stupid scrolling bug has returned! I have changed my review to "not recommended".\n\nI'm a little conflicted here. The game is pretty fun, but the campaign is so short. I beat it in 9 hours and that was with a fair amount of side-questing, so I'm not really sure It's worth the full price of the game.\n\nAlso, there is this annoying bug that makes everything scroll down. What I mean is, sometimes when in any type of inventory menu like shopping, your stash, and even on the map, the game scrolls down and you have to either grab the scroll bar with the mouse or hold the up key. Even then, if you are in an inventory menu you can't access items near the top because it just scrolls right back down again. The only way to "reset" this is to restart the game, but there is no telling it won't go immediately back to it again, and it will eventually do so.\n\nHowever, it's still a pretty fun game and I'm sure lots of extra content and bug fixes will come out in the future.\n\nOverall I give it 7/10 (changed to 5/10 based on lack of content) in its current state. Possibly an 8 or 9 with extra content, bugfixes, and a price drop.","October 25, 2015","false","22.1"," 14 of 30 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","14","30","0","0"

It could be played straight, or you could figure out how to break it and then plow on to quests that were only possible if you had a broken party.  That kind of respect for players, coupled with getting out of the game what you put in, made the first game amazing.  No such luck here.\n\nEverything in KPP2 is so carefully balanced that in the end there is only one good winning team.  Sure maybe the monk is nice, but by the time you've got him you don't need him.  I tried to do a conditions team.  Bought all the (very limited) game room stuff that would enable my party to inflict conditions more effectively, and have moves that target neighbors in effect hit all enemies, going full on in that direction.  Of course enemies can just heal themselves of status ailments right away (and bosses always do), and I had to watch the little die roll every time to see if the move was resisted or not, which added at least a minute to nearly every battle I was in.  So I just switched back to one warrior to taek damage, a cleric healer, and everyone else doing multi-target damage attacks, the only party worth having.\n\nFewer options and even fewer good options.  A crafting system and unique discoverable item, where the best equipment is still just the stuff you buy + a +3 scroll across the board.  Also, as an aside, I liked the 8 bit retro graphics more than the 16 bit style.  It's not "better graphics" when the whole point is that it's stylized.","December 23, 2015","false","20.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If the premise doesn't sound at least a tiny bit relatable, you might miss many of the jokes that KOPP2 tosses about, which are mostly in reference to D&D. In my opinion, the game stands on its own legs without most of the referential stuff-- it doesn't feel desperate for laughs like KOPP+1 did at times. KOPP2 also knows when to make fun of itself, and does a pretty good job of it.\n\n\n\n\nMechanically, the game feels more like a pen and paper game than KOPP+1 did, though it still feels more like a JRPG than it does D&D. The main difference lies in three attributes: Body, Senses, and Mind: that both dictate derives stats (like KOPP staples Threat and Initiative) and fuel new resistance rolls, which are used to end effects in a manner similar to D&D's saving throws. These attributes are difficult to increase, requiring expensive trinkets or rare treasures to raise.\n\nCharacter creation is still a highlight, as expected, though the pool of players has been more normalized. (No more dog, or robot, or what have you.) While I enjoyed it as much as I did in the original, there were definitely some characters that had somewhat useless abilities, especially when compared to powerhouse combos like Cheerleader/Thief and Rocker/Warrior (or Rocker/Paladin). Race selection is now present, though it's very fundamental: elves, humans, and dwarves. The races have more long-lasting effects than most players do (with exceptions like the Rocker and Surfer).\n\nMost of the core gameplay has been kept the same: form a party of regular people playing as characters, go on adventures, profit. 95% of the quests are still the same fare that KOPP+1 offered, which was killing x creatures at y location. Dungeons are still around, though I found them to be more of a hindrance; the frequent rolls to avoid traps didn't add challenge so much as frustration.\n\nEquipment feels much more D&D-like than it did in the original, and it also feels more natural. Gone are the days of grinding for grindstones-- weapons can be improved by enchantment with scrolls, and crafting creates better magical options. In fact, many of the flaws of the first game have been removed: pay-to-win pandering with gold has been removed, as well as several of the more "phone game" mechanics, like waiting for armor/weapon upgrades. In their place is an equally frustrating magazine-oriented DLC system, in which some items, scenarios, and classes are behind either gold or solid cash. At the time of review, this system was sorely lacking, with only one class and one player able to be unlocked for gold, and the rest behind the $5 DLC.\n\nWhile I genuinely enjoyed this game, I can't say that I would suggest getting DLC for it. After the main campaign is over, the mechanics start to feel very samey, especially if you've been getting unlucky with random encounters and have fought many underleved foes as a result. Though a difficult boss (one of two difficult encounters in the whole game) sits at the end of the post-game quest, the end-game feels rather hollow-- and I'd bet on DLC filling it up later.\n\nOverall, I found the game to be fun for a weekend's distraction, or as a quick dose of RPG for a half hour or so. It's simple enough to pick up and play without getting lost in Pathfinder-esque customization. However, as a result, the finished product lacks the depth that some might expect from it.","November 9, 2015","true","9.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I would have loved for there to have been twice as much game play for a sixteen dollar game, but I still enjoyed every second of what game play there was.

My current favorite so far is the mystical item, the i.D.E.R.P.  The overall feel of the game strikes a nostalgic chord.  It reminds me of some of the classic SNES RPGs in how you manage equipment and combat.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bishopmanny/recommended/310060/","bishopmanny","BishopManny","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bishopmanny/","15 products in account","This retro tabletop RPG was a thoroughly satisfying meta-roleplaying experience. It made pop culture references both old and new, sighed wistfully about the good old days, and made many jokes. Speaking of jokes, this game deconstructs every RPG cliché in the book. No main story quest ends the way you'd expect it to, and by my count, there are three, including the "Here be dragons" expansion. There are also many sidequests to flesh out each main story by giving the NPC's some love.\n\nGrinding is optional. If you do all the quests before moving on, you'll be strong enough to handle the dungeons and bosses. The dungeons test your endurance, but that's easily solved by crafting enough HP and MP potions. The crafting system becomes much easier if you make 1 of each item to compare them.\n\nCharacter roles and classes are straightforward and easy to unlock just by playing the game to gather enough gold. As with the crafting system, knowing which role/class to use becomes much easier by trying each at least once. I recommend focusing on only 1 or 2 skills per character. Evenly spreading your skill points around all 4 skills is a bad idea for almost every class.\n\nCertain classes complement each other very well. You can swap out classes without losing levels, redistribute skill points, or even delete characters altogether.\n\nTry this game if you like retro RPG's!","April 4","true","24.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is a turn-based RPG strategy game developed by Kyy Games and published by Paradox Interactive. It was released in October 2015 on Steam. I have played KoPP +1 before. It contains a lot of improvements to KoPP +1 as well as new mechanics, which I will explain about later.\n\nGAMEPLAYYou will start by creating two players to start off with, and later you will have five. You must choose a character, class, and race for each player. There are eight characters you can use to start with, each has their own unique bonuses. There are also six classes to choose from, each with different and unique skills. You can unlock more classes and characters as you progress throughout the game. The tip is to create a player with a good combination of character, class, and race.\n\nYou can level up your character by getting exp points. Each level up gets you one skill point that you can use to improve your skills. You can get exp points from finishing quests and battling monsters. The game doesn't have a difficulty level, so it will be harder as you progress. The body, sense, and mind point are a new addition to the series. It affects the players' stats and the chance to get status effects. In KoPP 2 is how random number generation plays a bigger role in the gameplay, whereas in KoPP +1, it only affects minor things, such as: traveling, dungeons, and fleeing.\n\nThere are also items and equipments which you can buy with gold or find. You can get gold from finishing quests, defeating monsters, and dungeons. The items and equipments will increase your players' stats if you equip it.  Another new addition to the series is the crafting feature. You can create items, equipments, and consumables from crafting. You can also enchant your equipment with charms and enchantment scrolls to further boost your stats. Also, mechanics like HP/MP steal from attacks, and HP/MP regen per round which is on the previous game is absent.\n\nPROSThe first thing you will notice is the pixel-art which I think looks good and beautiful. It has a lot of more depth compared to the previous game. What I really like most about this game is the humor, which is filled with geeky humor that is written brilliantly in my opinion. The NPCs are also filled with pop culture references which I enjoy. The game still gets a new update every few months which I hope stays that way.\n\nOne of the new additions that I like is that you can now fully reset your player without losing your current level. In the previous game, you can only reset your player's skill points. So if you would like to change class, character, or race, you can do it now. It costs a lot more to reset though, so you must plan it wisely. The dungeon is a lot better though, but it gets repetitive sometimes.\n\nThe main story should take you several hours to finish, but there are a lot more quests after that, especially from the Here Be Dragons DLC. The story itself is great and funny in my opinion, I really enjoyed it. The soundtrack for this game is excellent and memorable as well.\n\nCONSHowever, there are a things that I don't like. The first thing you will notice is the 3d-party DRM, which is the Paradox Account. It doesn't bother you that much, but this game is not supported by Steam Cloud, however, it uses the Paradox Account as a cloud for some reason. I haven't lost my save file, but I still find Steam Cloud to be more reliable because sometimes, when I start the game, it asks me which save file should I use, the one in the cloud or the local file even though it is the same exact file. It happens a few times, which I find annoying.\n\nOne of the major flaw in my opinion is that the game doesn't scale very well. There is almost nothing worth spending gold on as you progress later in the game. I currently find myself with 11k gold with nothing to spend on. There should be a lot more items in the shop. The items that you find from quests are far superior from items in the store or even crafting. The crafting system could be improved to be a lot better in my opinion as it creates a few good items only and almost no useful items for late game.\n\nThe area investigation is uninteresting and useless in my opinion. It could be improved a lot better by adding some sort of random events or something to make it more interesting. The cost of each roll of investigating should scale higher as you progress. Each roll only costs 5 gold, which is almost nothing later in the game. Some drops like crafting ingredients are unclear about where to get them, so you will mostly have to guess where to find them. The wikia page for the game, doesn't give you much information and is irrelevant. So it could be hard to get information about the game.  Luckily the in-game help has some good information.\n\nSUMMARYAfter all of the flaws, do I still enjoy the game? ABSOLUTELY. I really enjoyed playing it from start to finish. The KoPP series is very underrated in my opinion. Even though this is the second game, you don't have to play the first game in order to understand KoPP 2. It is a very fun and addicting game that I could easily recommend to anyone.","April 9","true","24.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It could be played straight, or you could figure out how to break it and then plow on to quests that were only possible if you had a broken party.  That kind of respect for players, coupled with getting out of the game what you put in, made the first game amazing.  No such luck here.\n\nEverything in KPP2 is so carefully balanced that in the end there is only one good winning team.  Sure maybe the monk is nice, but by the time you've got him you don't need him.  I tried to do a conditions team.  Bought all the (very limited) game room stuff that would enable my party to inflict conditions more effectively, and have moves that target neighbors in effect hit all enemies, going full on in that direction.  Of course enemies can just heal themselves of status ailments right away (and bosses always do), and I had to watch the little die roll every time to see if the move was resisted or not, which added at least a minute to nearly every battle I was in.  So I just switched back to one warrior to taek damage, a cleric healer, and everyone else doing multi-target damage attacks, the only party worth having.\n\nFewer options and even fewer good options.  A crafting system and unique discoverable item, where the best equipment is still just the stuff you buy + a +3 scroll across the board.  Also, as an aside, I liked the 8 bit retro graphics more than the 16 bit style.  It's not "better graphics" when the whole point is that it's stylized.","December 23, 2015","false","20.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The whole "life's Blood," "Sweat, Blood & Tears," with the whole "Earn What You Keep" aspect, is what I most enjoyed about the sequel. I am quite partial to the upgraded 16 bit artwork and sound bytes. Another hype I must plug, is the grinding aspect, it's even got it's own farm! No more hours of hardcore grinding, you can earn all the gold, EXP, loot, weapons, trinkets, armour, upgrades and even craft your own! With a plethora of content, a great UI, it's a smorgasboard of quirky references with an amazing layout (not to mention that it is also Steam Controller and Gamepad supported), I give this, fantastic sequel, a Total Roll of 11/11, Tripple Ctrit.

Rolled a 1 or 2 while traveling through one village and I get a bunch of things that were just a waste of time to stop and fight.\n\nI did love the addition of the dungeons.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/triasadi/recommended/310060/","triasadi","MLGesus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/triasadi/","117 products in account","Knights of Pen and Papers 2 Review\nKnights of Pen and Papers 2 is the second game for the Knights of Pen and Paper series or KoPP for short. It is a turn-based RPG strategy game developed by Kyy Games and published by Paradox Interactive. It was released in October 2015 on Steam. I have played KoPP +1 before. It contains a lot of improvements to KoPP +1 as well as new mechanics, which I will explain about later.\n\nGAMEPLAYYou will start by creating two players to start off with, and later you will have five. You must choose a character, class, and race for each player. There are eight characters you can use to start with, each has their own unique bonuses. There are also six classes to choose from, each with different and unique skills. You can unlock more classes and characters as you progress throughout the game. The tip is to create a player with a good combination of character, class, and race.\n\nYou can level up your character by getting exp points. Each level up gets you one skill point that you can use to improve your skills. You can get exp points from finishing quests and battling monsters. The game doesn't have a difficulty level, so it will be harder as you progress. The body, sense, and mind point are a new addition to the series. It affects the players' stats and the chance to get status effects. In KoPP 2 is how random number generation plays a bigger role in the gameplay, whereas in KoPP +1, it only affects minor things, such as: traveling, dungeons, and fleeing.\n\nThere are also items and equipments which you can buy with gold or find. You can get gold from finishing quests, defeating monsters, and dungeons. The items and equipments will increase your players' stats if you equip it.  Another new addition to the series is the crafting feature. You can create items, equipments, and consumables from crafting. You can also enchant your equipment with charms and enchantment scrolls to further boost your stats. Also, mechanics like HP/MP steal from attacks, and HP/MP regen per round which is on the previous game is absent.\n\nPROSThe first thing you will notice is the pixel-art which I think looks good and beautiful. It has a lot of more depth compared to the previous game. What I really like most about this game is the humor, which is filled with geeky humor that is written brilliantly in my opinion. The NPCs are also filled with pop culture references which I enjoy. The game still gets a new update every few months which I hope stays that way.\n\nOne of the new additions that I like is that you can now fully reset your player without losing your current level. In the previous game, you can only reset your player's skill points. So if you would like to change class, character, or race, you can do it now. It costs a lot more to reset though, so you must plan it wisely. The dungeon is a lot better though, but it gets repetitive sometimes.\n\nThe main story should take you several hours to finish, but there are a lot more quests after that, especially from the Here Be Dragons DLC. The story itself is great and funny in my opinion, I really enjoyed it. The soundtrack for this game is excellent and memorable as well.\n\nCONSHowever, there are a things that I don't like. The first thing you will notice is the 3d-party DRM, which is the Paradox Account. It doesn't bother you that much, but this game is not supported by Steam Cloud, however, it uses the Paradox Account as a cloud for some reason. I haven't lost my save file, but I still find Steam Cloud to be more reliable because sometimes, when I start the game, it asks me which save file should I use, the one in the cloud or the local file even though it is the same exact file. It happens a few times, which I find annoying.\n\nOne of the major flaw in my opinion is that the game doesn't scale very well. There is almost nothing worth spending gold on as you progress later in the game. I currently find myself with 11k gold with nothing to spend on. There should be a lot more items in the shop. The items that you find from quests are far superior from items in the store or even crafting. The crafting system could be improved to be a lot better in my opinion as it creates a few good items only and almost no useful items for late game.\n\nThe area investigation is uninteresting and useless in my opinion. It could be improved a lot better by adding some sort of random events or something to make it more interesting. The cost of each roll of investigating should scale higher as you progress. Each roll only costs 5 gold, which is almost nothing later in the game. Some drops like crafting ingredients are unclear about where to get them, so you will mostly have to guess where to find them. The wikia page for the game, doesn't give you much information and is irrelevant. So it could be hard to get information about the game.  Luckily the in-game help has some good information.\n\nSUMMARYAfter all of the flaws, do I still enjoy the game? ABSOLUTELY. I really enjoyed playing it from start to finish. The KoPP series is very underrated in my opinion. Even though this is the second game, you don't have to play the first game in order to understand KoPP 2. It is a very fun and addicting game that I could easily recommend to anyone.","April 9","true","24.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
