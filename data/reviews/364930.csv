It is like a combination of Go Fish, Old Maid, Bridge, Whist, Gin Rummy, Poker, Eucre, and Cribbage.  Instead of 13 cards in only 4 suits, there 4 cards per season or month with the added bonus of special higher point sets of 3 to 5 cards.  It is a bit confusing a first, I admit, but there is an in-game visual guide to the card hands.  Plus before beginning any card matches or tournment matches there is a very informative tutorial about how to play.  It also helps that your playing cards become highlighted along with the central "pot" cards to help find matches.  This card game is very challenging.","November 1, 2015","true","4.7"," 44 of 49 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","44","49","0","0"

If your playing becuase you just want to try it out, saw it in an anime movie(Summer Wars), or just becuase, its a great start to teach you how to play the game of Koi Koi. Its pretty bare basics with a bit of a learning curve (mostly with just remembering which card is which and what ones go into a pair), but by played a few rounds you can quickly pick up the basics to the game. If your looking for a different kinda card game to play I defintaly recomend Koi Koi.\n\nThe music is good and it fits the pace of the game, and the coms in quick play are not brutal. I havn't tried the collection mode but I assume it'll work like a tournument getting harder each round. The cards all look really nice and the game also looks nice. The only thing is the lack of a exit button if your in full screen mode. An online multiplayer option would make the game perfect.\n\nOtherwise really fun and worth the money to play if you like Japanese card games/dont mind a learning curve! :) KOI KOI!!","April 27, 2015","true","1.9"," 47 of 55 people (85%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","85","47","55","5","2"

This version is extremely basic for the £6.99 price tag.\n\nThere are very jarring animation issues - for example when cards are dealt from the stack they disappear and appear elsewhere on the board, rather than moving from the stack to the new position. This is extremely jarring even for experienced players. The same is true when you match a card, the card begins to move in one direction and then just disappears and pops up elsewhere.\n\nThere's also no way to turn off the 'hint' mode (which highlights matching cards on the board when you hover over a card in your hand). This is pretty frustrating for advanced players and will cause lazy/bad habits in new players.\n\nNor are there any difficulty settings, so whether you're a beginner or an expert you get the same experience.\n\nThe game only offers two modes "Full Screen" or "Windowed" - you cannot resize or set the resolution of either mode. The windowed mode is rather small on a large resolution display.\n\n'Yaku', 'Koi Koi' and 'Stop' overlays cannot be skipped and take too long to display which will make each game longer than it needs to be.\n\nThe main reason I'm being so particular in this review is that for £6.99 I would expect a more polished experience. Compared to other versions of this game (on iOS, Android, Windows 8 Store or even on the web) the game is lacking in polish and I recommend getting your Hanafuda fix elsewhere.","April 30, 2015","false","21.3"," 47 of 64 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","47","64","0","0"

Stills are nice, but once things start go get in motion... I confess before this game, I never would have thought you could fail at animating cards moving over a board.\nThere is also the odd artistic choice on cards here and there, and the omnipresence of the English language, even if you set the game to Japanese.\nThere is of course no multiplayer, because who plays with real people?\nEven against an automated opponent, the pacing of the game is pretty bad on fast setting, with scoring being handled by individual banners for each trick, one after the other - if you are familiar with the game, you know this can happen dozens of time in a big hand game.\nThen, and this one is a deal-breaker : there is the glaring absence of any (really, any!) rule customization. They are all hard-set, and you better be glad with them.\nThe AI is also pretty stupid, not attempting to reverse a loss on the final month of a game, and stopping early.\n\nYou can get better, for free. And you can get infinitely better, for a small fee, on any phone or tablet.\n\nAlso, the boob-fishing on the game's Steam banner?

It caught my attention in a Steam sale.  I was worried it would be super complicated, but the tutorial did a good job of quickly explaining the basics, and then right into Quick Play mode where after a couple games I felt like I had a pretty good idea what I was doing.  It's a fun game, a bit like poker, with the gambling aspect, and the different points for different series.  The hardest part is remembering what goes with what, and the game helps with that by highlighting valid moves, and with easy access to the rules.  Before I knew it I had already sunk a couple hours into my first session, was really enjoying it.  Haven't even touched the "Collection Mode" yet.\n\nThe presentation and interface is nice and polished.  It's a mouse and keyboard game, but was perfect to play from bed on the TV using the Steam controller.\n\nI also purchased a physical deck on Amazon for $11, made by Nintendo.  It's an interesting story.  This is an ancient game, but I had no idea Nintendo actually got their start in 1889, selling these cards for 100 years prior to the NES...!  And still make and sell them to this day.\n\nI also just got done streaming the movie Summer Wars on Vudu.  (First time using Vudu.  Can recommend.)  Highly, highly recommend the movie.  Check out a trailer.  Let's just say the card game Hanafuda makes several appearances and is significant to the plot.  But it's a great movie, reminiscent and of similar quality to Studio Ghibli films.  Apparently the game caught quite a few people's attention through that movie as well.\n\nI was a little hesitant to purchase this due to the developers other uh... questionable... titles.  But this game is legit.","October 30, 2015","true","8.4"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","17","20","0","0"

The UI and presentation is about as beautiful and simplistic as the Hanafuda deck itself. You can jump in for a match instantly with Quick Play or try Collection Mode, which is a sort of "campaign" like mode where you choose a region of Japan and face an opponent in a game of Koi-Koi. The main focus of this mode is to collect postcards that depict beautiful photographs taken in the region you chose previously.\n\nOverall, it's simply Koi-Koi, and that's all you really need a game like this to be. It's presented in a lovely way and there's even a tutorial for new players. The game goes as far as highlighting possible matches for yakus, and even a complete list of both the cards and yakus for you to look over at a glance.\n\nIf you are new to Koi-Koi and are interested in learning to play it, or a long time fan of the age old playing card game, it's certainly worth picking up!","April 28, 2015","true","2.1"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","15","18","0","0"

It capitalises on you being greedy and punishes you for it a lot.\n3) Brilliant Tutorial\n- I made slides to teach this game to my friends. This game has it all written down and the limits of the what moves you can make and identifying the Yaku immediately helps it with beginners a lot. I think anyone looking to learn Hanafuda should start with the game.\n\nNegatives:\n1) House Rules?\n- The game at one stage said the game is played accross Japan with house rules and It would be GREAT if they had that here, especially with their collection mode which honestly needs a bit of more substance for it to have more replay value.\n2) Multiplayer\n- This game badly needs this for the game community to expand. I have actual Hanafuda cards so I can get by without it but having this multiplayer function would be brilliant for this game.\n3) One Trick AI\n- The AI is great and all but its play has little variance. Gets Yaku, 2 cards left? Stops. Gets 3 Brights? Chances are, stops. I have played with my friends and seen ridiculous draws like throwing down a Chrysanthenum card to only pick up a sake cup that just flipped open into double viewing combo (Moon, Sakura and Sake Cup). I don't see the AI having the balls to do that. I know making AI is hard but having some variance in AI, like one that plays more safely, another that plays aggressively will add so much depth into this game.\n\nLooking at the collection mode, I feel that the game missed some chances to make it a Brilliant game because having all those individuals across Japan you can play against might be like some AI gauntlet with each with local house rules or differing AI. That would have been a strong feature that adds a lot of replayability but overall I love when traditional games like this get to see the light of day on Steam and gain a wider audience. Overall, I would reccomend this game to people who like traditional games that have a lot of luck involved but also a bit of skill.","April 30, 2015","true","9.1"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","14","17","0","0"

That's perfect. This game isn't a household game in the west. And these three aspects are INCREDIBLY important because Koi-Koi is the type of game that will play differently from home to home.\n\nThis version of Koi-Koi is nice for playing against AI. It's quick, and you feel a sense of accomplishment when you've bested the opposition. If you want to get some competitive Koi-Koi going, this should scratch that itch well enough.\n\nHowever, there are no variations (to my knowledge) in the rules and point-counting. This may be a minor issue since there is possibly a "traditional" version that this game adheres to, but altering the rules for your style is what makes a game like this so appealing. It's why poker has so many variants, or why you can grab a deck of "Standard" playing cards and create a multitude of games.\n\nI'm also not a fan of the impossibly-titted hostess of the game. Hanafuda, guys, not hentai.\n\nOtherwise, if you've always been interested in this game and have never had someone to play with, you can't get much better in a virtual environment.\n\n","April 29","true","1.2"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

I was kind of uncertain about how to play as the tutorial explains extreme basics of the game and not much else, but after playing a few quick games against the computer opponent you soon learn what's good and what's not.\n\nThe only way I can think to explain it to someone who has never played is it's a little like the  'snap' where you have to match playing cards, only instead of matching a 5 of a suit to another 5 of a suit you have to match flowers/trees of the month to other flowers/trees of the same month to collect cards (So 4 cards/flowers of 12 suits/months) and instead of matching your cards to your opponents, you match them to a selection of cards in the center of the play area. However, matching cards  doesn't mean you get points right away like you would if you were playing snap where you just have to get the most cards to win. Heck you could get points at the start of a round, only to lose them to the opponent at the end of the round. The points system is kind of like a tug of war, and it can go either way.\n\nWhen you get a point-scoring combination of cards you get the option to say 'Koi Koi!' (Come on!) to your opponent. If you (or you opponent) call Koi Koi the music picks up the pace adding to the sense of... I want to say 'urgency' but I'm not sure that's the word I want... But it becomes a lot more fast-paced at least. Saying Koi Koi can mean more points to be won, but also more points to be lost, so it's  a bit of a gamble whether you carry on or not, but I find that's half the fun. Saying no to calling Koi Koi ends the round there.\n\nIt does take a bit of learning for the Yaku cominations, and maybe even for the months of the cards when choosing the dealer for the game, but it's quite fun when you learn it. I was terrified at first because I didn't know any of the months or what flowers or combinations would work, but at the top of a game screen you can click on the 'Cards' or 'Yaku' at any time and look at them. Not only that, but even if you don't look at those and you start a game, if you have any cards that match with the ones in the middle they're highlighted, and it's a helpful feature.\n\nI've only played the Quick Game part of Koi Koi, I haven't tried the Collection mode, so I can't comment on that, but I like what I've played so far.\n\nThis is probably more for those who have an interest in Japan, but if you also have an interest in card games, it might be worth a look at. I'd probably give it an 8/10","April 30, 2015","true","7.8"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

The tutorial is alright, but because of the sheer amount of info (you're learning to play a new card game after all), much of it actually flies over your head even if you're paying attention. But when you start to play the interface lights up matching cards, which makes it easier especially for beginners.\n\nAfter you get the hang of matching cards is when the real game begins. The AI is clever and is seriously trying to form the right cards, and will mercilessly beat you whenever possible.\n\nGraphics are simple and clean, sound is alright. Music is traditional, which is perfect.\n\nIt has a sort of career mode called "Collection mode" where you challenge players from different regions to collect postcards.\n\nAll in all, great fun if you have the patience and determination to learn it.

The music is soothing though, and I would rather listen to it to relax than play.\n\nThe interface is nice and smooth. Simplistic, at best. Granted, there is no way to turn off the animations that are within the game. When you leave the window, the game ends up being at a standstill. So, if you think you can play while multitasking... It won't work. There is no option to fix this within the game settings either.\n\nPlaying in either Quickplay or Collection mode, there isn't a significant difference besides collecting postcard images in Collection mode. So there really isn't much to go on. There isn't a change of difficulty either. So you're just playing a very linear game through and through.\n\nWhen playing, you are stuck with mouseover hints and, if you accidentally click on a card where there are two options.... there are no take-backs. You HAVE to play that card. There is also no way to skip in-game animations either. So sometimes the game feels a bit stretched out than it should.\n\nAs others have said, it is a very basic hanafuda game and, for the price of $10, you may as well play it as a free flash game or get a free version for your mobile device. So even if you pay for the mobile versions, those at least give you a bang for your buck. To the very least, there are some of those that have a multiplayer option.","April 2","false","13.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

While there is room for strategy, it's heavily outweighed by random chance. The game essentially boils down to a match-2-or-more, and the second half of each turn top-decks a card to match against the ones on the board. It was common to have no good moves an entire round, just because of how cards were dealt.\n\nOK, so Koi-Koi Japan didn't invent Hanafuda, and shouldn't be punished for it. Still, I give a thumbs down. The tutorial was abrupt and jumped around quickly. The game only supports one resolution and stretches it to fill a 1080p window.\n\nThe game may have only been a buck, but it led mostly to frustration.","May 3","false","4.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

So I do recommend, it is a good purchase. But do so at your own risk.\n\nI don't know anything at all about Hanafuda, but that is why I got the game. Probably still don't cause the tutorial talked about local rules and there are different "regions" you can play, but nothing seemed differet. And it's a lot of luck and memorization, 48 cards cateforized into the 12 months, 4 cards for each month, and all the combinations of them, with some of those combinations having their own rules of forming.\n\nIt's a really really pretty game. Even without the busty anime women on the stores front page. And she only appears in the tutorial mode, after you download the expansion pack and turn her on. So she can go completely unnoticed and you wouln't cause it's all pretty and traditional japanese stylish. The expansion that comes with the game also as extra cards designs and BGM that are equally as pretty. Art buget was not stingy.\n\nBut when I say luck I mean, Lady Luck is a dominatrix and you're her new ♥♥♥♥♥, kind of luck. One game I played I was winning 51-9 halfway through the game (there are 60 points total between the two players) and every round after that the com kept winning each round with the biggest point combination and eventually won the game with 2 points a head. I don't think I have ever been so mad at a game. I don't know if I suck or if the AI is suuuuuper hard.\n\nSo it's a play at your own risk game. You may be good, you may bad. I'm probably bad cause I'm still new and I'm playing a against a hanafuda computer. I'd say get it cause to try and get yourself cultured.","November 28, 2015","true","7.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I do agree with the negative review below that says the card movement is a bit choppy but gameplay is still solid. There are so few retail hanafuda games in English, I can only think of the minigame in the Yakuza series on PS3 offhand, so to be able to just boot this up and play is great. I think the AI opponents are quite easy to beat and there is no multiplayer (maybe the devs could put in a play against opponent by IP connection option?) but they're not so easy as to just let you win and it's quite relaxing.","March 18","true","11.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Wish I could give a neutral review.\n\nThe music is nice, the graphics are decent enough and the "collection" mode has some replay value through making you collect post-cards from defeating opponents.\n\nThe issues are that there's no rule customization at all (you only get to pick rounds, 6 or 12), the animations are really shoddy (so bad that I feel kinda lost sometimes, imagine THAT), there's no online and it just feels amateurish and lacking overall. Kinda silly that there's no difficulty options at all. The AI is nothing special, either.\n\nBut really, the horrid animations are the worst part, they make it all feel really weird.\n\nTo be honest, the koi-koi minigame in the Yakuza series is better. It has better graphics (it has GOOD animations), it has better rule customization (it has rule customization at all) and it has different AI levels. The only issue with the koi-koi minigame in Yakuza is that it's less pick-up and play by virtue of being a minigame, specially since those games console-exclusives.\n\nStill, it seems to go on sale frequently for a single dollar. It's lacking, but for $1 it's quite alright.","December 13, 2015","true","5.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Well, for beginners like myself, it is not easy to know and memorize all the cards combination required to win the game. You just have to play many times to get an idea how to go about. While winning is the main objective, it is crucial to know what cards to play even if your hand isn't good, to prevent your opponent from winning.\n\nThere are two game modes aside from Tutorial -- Quick Play and Collection Mode. In Collection Mode, there is a map of Japan divided in 8 areas where you get to play against the person of each area. Winning a match will get you a postcard from the area; each area has 5 postcards to collect, which is essential for achievement.\n\nWhile the game can be rather repetitive, it is fairly enjoyable. The DLC Enjoy Pack is currently free to download (as per the special discount offer) and consists of a new guide character, various Fuda designs and in-game BGM. It would have been better if the DLC included more challenges, difficulty and achievements.","December 14, 2015","true","22.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's simple to learn, but the more you play it, the more you understand how to make the best decisions.\n\nBasically you're trying to form suits (Yaku) that provide a variety of points. But you can only match cards into your suits if there's a corresponding card type on the field, if you can't match cards then you'll need to put down the card on the field, which you will be able to use next turn (Or your opponent might snatch it before it gets there.). So sometimes, if a opponent has almost a complete suit, and you know that your opponent might be waiting for a certain type to go onto the field, then you'll just avoid playing that 1 card so that your opponent might need to discard the card that he requires and you could take it for yourself.\n\nIt's a bit hard to understand but, if you play it just try to learn the Yaku and through experience you'll understand what type of yaku need to be matched with what cards. Each card type has a season/month related to it, and you can only match cards with the same seasons. If you play it, you'll understand it.\n\nBest 1 euro you can spend on steam!\n\nP.S Even though there's a anime girls picture on the game logo, there's nothing anime related in the game itself.","February 7","true","5.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
