Imagine a puzzle platformer with horrible controls that holds your hand through the entire 2 hours it takes you to wander through it. Now imagine that, once in awhile, that game turns into the underwater bomb defusal level from the first Ninja Turtles NES game. That's Last Inua, and it's about as much fun as it sounds. Strong art direction alone doesn't make this game worth it when balanced against all the ways that this game fails as...well, a game.","October 17, 2015","false","3.6"," 46 of 54 people (85%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","85","46","54","6","0"

Next, i see my game is in Russian. Developer says : "The game's language is determined by the language you machine is set in." My OS in actually in English, but who cares... There are indeed no language settings whatsoever, as well as no graphic ones. Only Continue, New Game, Controller Preset, Window Mode, Exit. That's the whole menu. And i don't know about the other translations, but the Russian one is definitely not well done, since i've noticed multiple words spelled together. Again, lazy iOS port.\n\nDespite of other reviewers saying it has an interesting story, i'll say it's boring. The gameplay is linear, and puzzles are very simple. You control two characters, the Father and the Son, each having specific abilities. The Father can jump, destroy ice boulders and climb, while the Son can teleport through some magical read beams and sometimes create a temporal path between two obstacles. And that's it. You need to do what you need to, when you need to. No room for imagination in those fairly simple maps... In some maps, there is even en exact pattern by which you need to move the characters, and by doing it wrong i got stuck a few times being unable to continue. Naturally, i killed the character intentionally so can can start over, but imagine my surprise when i got revived in the same spot where i was stuck. To get over it i had to kill a character various times in different location before i was able to restart from an earlier point. And lastly, the controls are also imprecise. Jumping is a pain in the ♥♥♥, and when using the Son to create a temporal path, it will sometimes leave a gap in it, and since the characters are moving automatically on it, they will sometimes fall and die.\n\nBetter save your money and get Never Alone instead of this cheap and lazy iOS port...","December 18, 2014","false","6.2"," 65 of 91 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","65","91","2","2"

While I liked the puzzle platforming well enough, the controls are frustrating. Expect slow moving animations and  slow to respond controls. It's like playing with work gloves on.  You try to hit the right key and most of the time you miss the mark not because you hit the wrong key, but because you have to alot 1-2 extra secs for the actual game to catch up. While cumbersome, it did not ruin the platforming for me.\n\nWhat *did* make me almost rage quit were the "flying" end levels.  Those were not fun, not enjoyable, and frustrating because the controls are are difficult to handle.  Much like trying to swim with momentum in a minefield, it's a horrible way to end a level.  The first "flying" level took me...I dunno 50+ times to complete it?  The second flying level was easier at about 25+ times and the very last level is a breeze.  And it's a one hit instant death with a full animation restart each time.  Annoying.  The rest of the game was not like that - if I died I just started right away where I left off.  Very scream-inducing and the main reason I have to gives it a thumbs down.  It did not help that I would often get stuck on geometry on the flying levels and sometimes just landing on the ground would kill me.  If not for those 2 flying levels I say, give it a go.","February 23, 2015","false","4.5"," 17 of 17 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","17","17","0","2"

Ataataq can use his strength to move and smash objects and climb walls with his ice pick, while Hiko can teleport and cast bridges made of light. Sometimes you take different paths with  each character, sometimes they both help each other out.\n\nThe game's difficulty isn't too high, but it's a fun and delightful experience throughout. And having a 2D platformer that isn't rock hard is a nice change these days. Controls could be a bit more precise, but since it is quite easy that doesn't ruin the game at all.\nThe graphics are rather minimalistic, but still great to look at.\nThe musical score has a mystic vibe and is very fitting.\n\nNevertheless, there are some shortcomings. The game is clearly a mobile port, and albeit a good one sadly in no way polished for the PC platform. Enabling anti aliasing via NVidia settings to make it look better did the job, but shouldn't be required of one. There are no language settings, you have to go with the one your system is using. And the game commits the cardinal sin of typography: it uses the ugly Comic Sans as a font. This is even more puzzling since the mobile version doesn't.\n\nIt is also a rather short experience. The play time homes in at about or slightly above two hours (insert Angry Joe rage quote here). The levels are accordingly short. But this is not to be understood as a negative point: it's clearly a choice by the devs, and making the game longer would have probably stretched out the gameplay and make it overstay it's welcome.\n\nDespite the already moderate price, I would still recommend waiting for a sale because of the lacklustre port.\n\nAll in all, it's a charming small game and well worth a try if you're into the genre.","April 9, 2015","true","5.2"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","17","18","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/331980/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","Plenty of games have an ice level or two, but rarely are they set in the Arctic itself. Last Inua is a platforming adventure game where you take on the role of Atataaq and his son Hiko, travelling across the frozen wastes to survive the attack of a powerful demon. It’s a port of a mobile game which came through Steam’s Greenlight process to arrive on PC. The mobile roots are easy to spot, but it has become a decent title on the more powerful platform, although not particularly engaging.The Tonrar is a tricky demon who has arisen in the mythical Arctic. Luckily, Hiko has some mystical abilities which can be used to combat the darkness. However, he is physically weak so he depends on his strong father to protect him and clear paths through the ice. This is the main crux of the gameplay. Atataaq leads the way, bashing through obstacles and climbing up cliffs to progress. This allows Hiko to follow in his wake.The tables are sometimes turned however, as Hiko has an orb ally which is used to lay paths where there weren’t any before. This way he can create bridges across chasms and over spike pits so the father and son duo can keep going. He can also enter portals which will teleport him up to ledges and across gaps which Atataaq can either climb up or jump across. It quickly becomes evident that Hiko’s abilities are leftovers of the mobile game. The orb will only lay paths in set locations, and all you have to do is press a button to quickly dart between the portals. There is not a great deal of actual gameplay involved.Another example of the mobile background would be the sluggish controls. Both characters animate really slowly, to the point where I hate ledges because I have to watch them struggle to climb up them every time. Even turning around and running the other way looks like a chore to them.Also, nothing about the game is hard at all. There are enemies, but they are just as slow as our main characters, and they are easily led over ledges or into spikes. Even if they catch up to you, they have a little wind up on their attack animation, during which time you can normally get away.While the gameplay is basic, and the story is mostly vague mysticism without a great deal of substance, Last Inua really stands out with its aesthetic. It has a lovely hand drawn artstyle, and the weather effects and fantastic backgrounds really build a great atmosphere. Flashes of the demon will appear in the night sky behind the action, and skeletal ghosts will sometimes chase after the main characters, creating a really dark feel in places. In levels where the duo are above ground in the freezing night, the screen will slowly ice over, and the sound will become muffled as Hiko and Atataaq try and stave off the cold. In these situations they need to get to a fire as soon as possible to warm up, or they will die.Last Inua has some good ideas scattered throughout the game, but for the most part it’s a very average platformer. It looks great and creates a good atmosphere, but that’s not enough to make up for the lack of innovation.Overall 6/10.","February 10, 2015","true","38.2"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/antimagicSA/recommended/331980/","antimagicSA","anti-magic","http://steamcommunity.com/id/antimagicSA/","448 products in account","Last Inua is a classic example of good intentions being marred by both writing and gameplay.\n\nOn the positives, the game is gorgeous and anyone who says otherwise is either being extremely pedantic or contrary for the sake of it. The amount of effort put into the backgrounds and "cutscenes" is astounding and there is an immense depth of detail and dynamics going on. Also it is nice to see a different set of folklore being used for once.\n\nUnfortunately the story paired with said folklore is painfully weak and extremely predictable. Perhaps indie developers have some extreme parental/family issues (and judging by my generation's experience with divorce this is not an incorrect assumption) but it seems a little tired to fall back on a father/son pairing. Also the folklore used is limited at best and my understanding is no deeper than the usual norse, roman or greek mythology that are relentlessly plundered by the rest of gaming.\n\nThe father/son pairing is of course the focal point of the gameplay: one is strong and can jump, the other one can kind of teleport and make light bridges. Cute and simple idea, but the father who does all the platforming handles like a tank and has the incredibly irritating habit of performing a roll when he hits the ground from a certain height causing him to often head straight into hazards or fall off a platform. The gameplay completely sucks and is an active hinderance to the game at every turn, especially in the asinine "trials" where as the son you fly about and collect orbs. At first this made thematic sense, but in the second and third trials they do the exact same setup just with different hazards. It's incredibly lazy.\n\nThat's a lot of words for a two hour game but it is frustrating to see that a potentially interesting setting and mythology be completely wasted on bad gameplay and a cookie-cutter story. Get it in a bundle otherwise don't bother. Complete and utter disappointment.","February 24, 2015","false","2.0"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/allalright/recommended/331980/","allalright","allalright","http://steamcommunity.com/id/allalright/","1044 products in account","\nLast Inua is a puzzle game where you control a father and son (each with different abilities) and attempt to get to the end of the level. The father can jump, rock climb, and punch through giant boulders of ice like Chris Redfield. The son is a little weakling who can teleport through portals scattered throughout the level and can spread magical glitter dust you can walk on. A level generally plays out with the father taking the lead, breaking ice blocks to open up a path, and then the son can teleport and walk on his glitter dust to meet up with the father at the end of the level.\n\nThe controls are fairly loose and imprecise, but won't cause any issues except in a few troublesome areas. The glitter dust controls definitely have some problems, though. When using a controller, hitting the dpad left or right will drop the dust in its preset path. The son will start to walk with it (even if you're not touching the analog stick), which causes issues when the glitter dust does not fall correctly. It will often leave a giant hole where no dust was dropped and you'll fall right into a pit. It can be remedied a bit by using a mouse.\n\nIt does look pretty fantastic, though. Just look at the screens. The music and presentation are clearly going for a fairly "airy" feeling. The Ico, Journey, and Outland influences are fairly obvious.\n\nIt's a pretty short game (took me 2.5 hours), but I enjoyed it.

The artstyle is interesting, and the outlines of the story made me intrigued when I first bought it. The story began in a very sudden manor and the controls felt a bit wonky from the start, but it's a short game, so why not play through it once? That was my thought as I played this game and it was fine for what is was, although disappointing in terms of story and gameplay.\n\nThen I reached the first part where you get the power to fly around with the son. That is where the game turns from adequate to outright stupid. The first problem is the controls. The level is designed for precise flying and the controls for the game is somewhat floaty, which makes flying through somewhat tight corridors filled with spikes challenging in all the wrong ways.\n\nThe second problem is the the lighting. Throughout the flying level, where you try to control the son to the best of your ability, the game has sudden lightning flashes in the middle of a corridor of spikes. Not terribly startling, mind you, but distracting to the degree of me losing my concentration, making the flying all the more annoying.\n\nBut the third and biggest problem with the first flying level is the fact that there's sudden "surges" (wind?) that work against you, making you fly into walls and spikes alike. These come at the most awkward of times, which would not be as bad if you could actually compensate for them. You can't. Once I took a lot of momentum forward just to try and compensate, and the game just turned me on a dime and slammed me into a wall of spikes. Instead positioning is very important, and with the floaty controls... you get the issue.\n\nAll of these problems, together with the fact that it doesn't checkpoint you, made me quit this game after barely an hour of gameplay. Having such a level is gamebraking and stupid, and even if the story had been better and more well-paced, I doubt I would have continued to play this game. It was not worth my money nor my time, and I cannot recommend it to anyone.","March 21, 2015","false","0.9"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

You're met with a number of obsticles, challenges and enemies along the way which you have to over come, either individually or as a team. I'll admit a few of these challenges are incredibly frustrating (at least they were for me) but entirely compelling, and make you want to try harder to beat them instead of just giving up.\n\nThe story, while fully understandable, is not very developed (you are kind of just thrown into it) but with the guidance of what I can only descrive as the centre of a magic 8-ball communicating via what Im sure is Anime-Ace script, its not at all hard to keep up with what is happening at each stage of the game.\n\nThe animation is simple, and quite honestly adorable, and very well done for such a simple side scroller, and allows for easy character control. For the last half of this game I didnt even have to connect my mouse, which was fantastic as it was 3am and I was in bed.\n\nWhat really gets me about this game though, is the art. The art is outstanding. Beautiful, simple, magical. Art can make or break a game, I believe, and this games scenery, cut scenes and stills compliment the story, the characters and the game play perfectly. It brings and entirely new depth and delicacy to the game.\n\nMy only complaint is that I wish it were longer. I completed the game is just over two hours (which I will have to try and beat to unlock one of the 17 achievments.) Hopefully we'll get a sequel!\n\nI will definitely be playing this game again, and keeping my eye of Glowforth, the producing company, for any games in the future.\n\n10/10 loved it.","January 1, 2015","true","3.8"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

I reviewed Never Alone poorly and I wanted this game to redeem the emotional platformer set it the arctic. As its quite similar I think you'll find.\n\nHowever I hesitate to actually call it a platformer as I don't think its apt. I'd liken it more to the original Prince of Persia. The original 2D original. The movement is relatively stiff and doesn't really have any play making it more more akin to being an “action puzzler” which when purchasing can lead to some expectations that aren't met during gameplay.\n\nYou play as a boy and his father each with very different and extremely unique abilities. Each pulling each other through the stages. Which lends credence the the emotional aspect. They actually call out to each other taking control away at times letting you know its time to switch in order to solve the puzzle and progress.\n\nThe father is the only one that can jump and climb and through the loose narrative the boy has some powers like teleporting and dropping some orb dust to create bridges (in specific locations). There are also these sort of dream scape levels where the boy has the ability to float around where you are tasked with collecting some orbs and avoiding spikes and closing hallways. However these are by far the worst part of the game. If the regular stages range from middling to okay these dream scape stages range from please make this end and why is this happening. They control poorly and unlike the rest of the game where checkpointing is quite forgiving, the dream scape world requires you to collect all the orbs without dying in order to succeed making it unnecessarily stressful.\n\nTHE GIST\nAll in all, I don't hate the game. I like the art style. Outsmarting enemies feels fun and intuitive. The puzzles are.. okay. But as a package its negatives outweigh the positives.","March 5","false","1.7"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Nothing puts me in a calm state of mind than a quiet snowstorm late at night. No cars. No television. Just the light sound of wind and snow in the dark. This game captures that emotion very well. In fact, any time the music kicked in for a moment, I found it very jarring and wanted it to go away (which it usually would). Not having music for the majority of this game was a great decision by the devs.\n\nAs for the gameplay, it's a little clunky at points, but otherwise manageable once you figure out the basic controls. You don't have the agility of a typical platformer here. Here, movement is slow and jumping is laborious. I actually appreciate that design choice. Being bundled up against the cold wouldn't allow for much acrobatic movement.\n\nThe game manages to be both relaxing and pretty darn creepy. There was one level with a heavy snowstorm with black clouds that looked more like storm clouds. Add to that the short flashes of a demonic entity in the sky and the roaring of the storm around you and you've got an unsettling situation. There was another level where I I had to hurry to avoid these strange black orbs that kept growing and taking up the screen. I didn't know what they were, but when I got to a point with the father character to where they started spawning and heard my son scream for me down below from fear, I felt real anxiety. It was remarkable.\n\nI wouldn't pay full price for Last Inua, but I am very glad I got it for an excellent price in a bundle. The short time I've played was an amazing experience and perfect as a winter game.","February 18, 2015","true","1.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Nonetheless, I decided to give it a playthrough and I must say, I think this game is in the same boat as Eternal Winter, someone (The Long Dark) did something similar before Eternal Winter did so the game must be a rip off. In my opinion, that's not the case, aside from the obvious simularities, this game couldn't be any different. While I don't want to slate it, as I did enjoy playing it. It's not got the same connection with the characters and the Inuit people you'd have with Never Alone, it's also more prone to bugs and has a short story with no dialogue aside from the father and son calling to one another when they need help and a few cutscenes with an ominous voice explaining where you're going next.\n\nOverall, it's not a bad game. Not much of a story, a decent platformer but nothing groundbreaking. I'd recommend playing Never Alone over this but if like me, you got Last Inua in a bundle for a great price. It's worth a playthrough.","January 8, 2015","true","2.2"," 9 of 18 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","9","18","0","0"

The young boy, Hiko, is the only one who can save the inuit gods, and the older man, Attaak...Aquack...Atakauq...Ataa, must accept his son's role as he follows him through mainly the same snowy environments.\n\nThere is very little challenge in this game, and there are next to no puzzles, and with the exception of the flying segments you can complete the game with minimal effort. I guess it was more about the atmosphere, and Tonrar showing his scary face every minute or so.\n\nThe character animations are sometimes choppy, and turning speed is slow, but that can be helpful in some jumping sections. Breaking ice blocks with Ataa doesn't really pack that oomph that it should, as he literally smashes his way through solid ice with his bare hands, resulting in the blocks just disappearing.\n\nI don't really have anything to say about the sound. Seeing the son call out to his father, then hearing the fathers voice come from off the screen was really heartwarming, but the father and son calling out to each other got old quick, as it could interrupt the flow of my actions in tense situations.\n\nThe graphics are nice, but simple, but I wasn't really blown away. However, the sections that involved the giant animal gods really did look amazing, and highlighted the tone of the game exceptionally well, like when you are approaching the bird god, there's just feathers falling everywhere, and you're like "Wow, I wonder what's up there?" and then you see this massive bird perched high and its just like, "Holy ****, that's awesome".\n\nThe game does get a little repetitive after a while, but I was able to finish it in under two hours in my first playthrough, so instead of going out to dinner with your parents this Saturday, play Last Inua instead.","April 11, 2015","true","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And the translation I was forced to use was not very good.\n\nThen the game compounded that by being rather boring and clunky and unoriginal. It's not terrible, but I really don't think it's worth the time to play it (let alone the money to buy it).","May 23","false","4.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
