"http://steamcommunity.com/id/geek2theright/recommended/461380/","geek2theright","Geek2theRight","http://steamcommunity.com/id/geek2theright/","340 products in account","I played through this game to the end, largely because it was pretty short. It wasn't bad or anything, but I honestly wouldn't recommend it to others.\n\nStory - It's not complicated, and it is more or less complete, but it still felt a bit lacking. There's even a bit of info thrown out at one point that begged for at least a side quest, but then it's quickly forgotten and never mentioned again.\n\nNo Side Quests - Not a single one as far as I could tell. There were 3 optional dungeons, but they had no story or quest content whatsoever. Just a bunch of enemies, winding paths, and treasure chests. One of them has multiple floors leading you to a room with a door, and then . . . nothing. Just another regular battle and a few treasure chests.\n\nCrappy Maps - They're just not good. Towns make horrible use of space. A lot of doors can't be entered, and the ones that do seem to be at random and lead to, at most, some unimportant NPC dialogue. This game really does not reward exploration. And the various dungeons are just narrow branching corridors with enemies and treasure chests almost never contain anything of value. There's like 2 puzzles in the game, and only barely. One of the optional dungeons has a ladder leading up, but you can't actually climb it. That same floor has an entire section that you can only see from a distance with enemies and treasure chests that you can't actually reach. I scoured everywhere on all of the floors you can visit, and nothing.\n\nUnderutilized Features - You can switch outfits on the fly, and some of them have special abilities tied to them, and/or they change the way certain NPCs react to you. Except that for the most part they don't, and only 1 outfit has abilities you'll use in more than 1 dungeon. Speaking of NPC dialogue . . .\n\nNPCs Never Change - There are a few event-related exceptions, but for the most part NPCs have one thing that they say/do throughout the entire game. That girl who's pretending to sleep on her lawn? No matter where in the game you are or what outfit you're wearing, nothing changes. Those tribesmen who tell you to go away? Even after you do the quest that makes you officially a friend of the tribe . . . they still want you to go away. Even if you wear the outfit you wear the outfit the chief himself gave you.\n\nThe Ending(no spoilers) - Basically, the ending sequence begins, takes a couple minutes to get through, and then it's over. And most of that time is spent on some NPC rather than, y'know, the characters you adventured with through most of the game. You don't really feel rewarded for completing the game.\n\nIt's functional. It's not overly challenging. It has a more or less complete story. But everything about it screams that it's a half-baked effort. If you just want something that scratches the itch and that you can finish in maybe 6 to 8 hours, you could do worse. But don't say I told you to get it, because I didn't. It's not total crap, but it's well below average. So . . . 3 out of 10? I think that's fair.","May 21","false","6.8"," 22 of 27 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","22","27","0","0"

Story has some funny bits.  It's not a bad story is, would be better if it had a few side quests and perhaps was fleshed out a bit more.\n\nAs I said ok for a few hours distraction as its pretty short one, the normal rpgs I usually play are usually 20+hours.\n\n","May 25","true","7.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

You're spending money on a game that lacks a lot of RPG aspect. Which are.\n1. Hidden secret items. Usually games that has shelves, book shelves, pots, barrels, and tables. Has hidden item/money. Which this game does not. Also I only found 2 treasure chest in the past hour.\n2. Lack of entry to homes. There are a lot of house's that you can not enter(It doesn't matter anyways because there wont be anything to grab from them anyways.\n3. Not much action. This game doesn't force you to level up like crazy to defeat the next enemies/bosses.\n4. This isnt much of a big deal but you can't use a controller to play this game.\n5. Music. I know I'm being a little picky but the music isn't great.\n6. No map system.\n7. No side missions.\n\nIf this game was free, i wouldn't be so harsh on it. But sadly, for paying 3 dollars and not getting much out of it just doesn't cut it for me. There are free game out there that would put this game to shame.\n\nJust to leave a good note. The game was decently enjoyable and there were some jokes that made me laugh.\nHere is a quick gameplay if you are interested in this game.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAJhyx819-g\n","May 26","false","1.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Along the way, there will be battles with assorted monsters, secets to discover, exploration to do, lots of items to find or buy, and numerous problems to solve.\nOld style 16-bit rpg experience that is very nicely done.\n\nAll these games, for me, are perpetuated by the story, and this one is clever with a lot of humor.\nThe art is nicely done, particularly in the battle scenes.\nMusic is very good ---- fits what is going on.\nNPCs offer just the right amount of help, and add to the exposition (and humor) of the tale.\nAs I indicated, there is lots of exploring to do, and you can search carefully or speed along as you prefer.\n\nThere is a system of buttons that is used that increase various stats as you go ---- get the "lucky" buttons for everyone.\n\nIt's a solid game that fans of the old 16-bit rpgs should look into for sure.\n\n","May 22","true","2.7"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"
