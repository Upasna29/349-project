It is a furiously fast-paced FPS with visceral and brutal combat, while at the same time mixing things up with off-road racing, RPG elements, mini-games and crafting.\n\nSounds an awful lot like Fallout, doesn't it? Well, it's not. Despite many striking similarities, RAGE is entirely its own game. It does all the things Fallout does, but in its own way. If you leave your expectations and comparisons at the door and just play the game for what it is, you will find a competent and diverse FPS that may keep you entertained for a good 10-12 hours.\n\nRAGE is a linar post-apocalyptic action game with a twist. It has towns with NPCs, quests, exploration, hidden loot and collectibles, mini-games and even racing tracks.\n\nBut most of all it is a hectic First Person Shooter, and this is where the game shines. The shooter element is the bread-and-butter of RAGE. It's fast, powerful, intense and it feels good! There are a wide range of weapons to use, each of which has numerous different ammunition types to spice things up even more. Take for example the crossbow; it fires regular steel bolts as one would expect - but swap them out with Dynamite sticks and watch your enemies panic as they realize they have only 3 seconds left to live. Swap in the Mindcontrol bolts and the crossbow turns your enemies into deadly walking bombs under your control!\n\nThe variety of weapons and ammo has you swapping back and forth between them with glee as you leave wasteland mutants in exploded gibs, charred corpses and decapitated slumps. What is even more striking is how the enemies move. They will pounce at you, climb railings to reach you and leap off of walls. They deftly dodge and weave in zig-zag patterns to make your life as miserable as possible. Their movement is fast, sporadic and unpredictable - and it just looks awesome.\n\nWhen you're not dropping mutants by the dozen, the town offers a nice breather away from the gunfights and gives you the opportunity to pick up side-quests for extra challenges. Race for glory at the local racing track or shop and listening to NPC banter. The mini-games range from strumming banjos, throwing dice or even pitting your deck of special playing cards against NPCs. You can also craft your own specialized ammo, grenades and other useful gadgets with ingredients scavenged on missions or bought from merchants.\n\nRAGE also has a few downsides, the most glaring perhaps being the poor and sudden ending. The plot is likewise lack-luster, uninteresting and just overall trivial. More often than not I found myself skipping story conversation because it was so bland I just wanted to go back to shooting stuff.\n\nThe graphics are a mixed blessing. Generally the sky and landscapes are mindlbowingly beautiful, but many of the up-close scenery looks washed out and blurry, sometimes to the point where you can't even make out what you are even looking at.\n\nThe sound effects and music is very good. The guns sound punchy and futuristic, and the voice acting is excellent from start to finish. The vehicle sounds are, however, quite bland.\n\nOverall I feel that RAGE is a worthwhile game that offers a very solid shooter experience and a fairly mediocre "everything else." Definitely worthwhile if you enjoy FPS games and/or wasteland style games.\n\n\n+ Excellent FPS-style gameplay, shooting mutants is a treat\n+ Great wasteland atmosphere and setting\n+ Tons of fun guns and ammo to play around with\n+ Lots of variation; racing, minigames, crafting, collectibles, exploring\n+ Gorgeous graphics in the landscape/environment/character department\n+ Excellent voice acting and music, overall good sound design\n\n- Muddy and blurry graphics in many interior areas and on up-close objects\n- The story is uninteresting and lacks engagement\n- Horrible ending\n- The game is too easy even on the hardest difficulty\n- Poor mouse controls when navigating menus and inventory\n- Engine sounds while driving is pretty weak","November 26, 2013","true","18.8"," 348 of 407 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","348","407","0","15"

However Rage has something new to offer. Yes, it is similar to other games, however what game is not? Rage has a style all its own and really pulls off what they were going for. This is a very grungy game, yet it has times of bright sunny skies and colorful scenes.\n\nThe story is not heavily detailed but that's alright for the type of game Rage is. It's a FPS that gets to the point and you never feel bored while playing. I thought the story was enough for me to have an idea of what's going on and get me into the action very smoothly. The first few missions give you a better idea of what's going on and flow of the story feels balanced.\n\nThe gameplay mechanics are very easy to use and to adapt to. Driving is fluid as is walking. The pace of walking is a bit quick, but I like it that way. Be that as it may, I often slowed down my pace to really take note to the detailed environments of the caves, tunnels and dilapidated buildings I scrounged through. The enemies are a joy to fight and have a mind of their own. From scaling the walls to jumping at the last second to dodge your attack, it quickly reminded me of the splicers who walked the ceilings of rapture in Bioshock. This makes it all the more challenging and enjoyable. Lastly, RAGE incorporates some RPG elements to help sooth that part of my gaming palate in the forms of customization, upgrades and side missions. All of that and a vehicle only multi-player tacked on? I believe that's a pretty good package.\n\nAll in all, I am happy with this purchase and would recommend this to anyone who enjoys shooters with creative atmospheres. I have read mixed reviews about it's length not being what people had hoped (about 10-12 hours) but then again, many of the shooters I have completed were only about 8 hours. With the existence of towns throughout, this will allow me to pace my gameplay and savor the experience without blowing through it a la any other mindless shooter.","December 28, 2013","true","32.5"," 248 of 284 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","248","284","0","12"

While it may not be as open as some other FPS/RPG games out there it does bring a few good things to the table that others do not have. The enemy models, animations and reaction are very well done, fluid and depending on which faction you're fighting against it might play out differently. NPC interactions are good, and facial animations are very well done making them feel organic at times. The story is a bit rough in places and if you've read anything about this game you will already know that the ending is well not great to say the least. While I do wish there was more to the game then what is offered it was mostly fun while it lasted. The tech in the game world is very nice and refreshing; the in game crafting is rather well done and very quick allowing you to use different items against different enemy types.\n\nthe "big picture" of each scene is mind-blowingly beautiful. This game's canyon vistas are the most intensely gorgeous I've ever seen, and I include Skyrim in that list. Even the interior scenes, with their gross 1990s textures are are composed and lit with an obvious hand-crafted touch. Graphically, it's a "don't miss the forest for the trees" kind of situation. Make no mistake though, the art direction and craftsmanship in-game is absolutely phenomenal and despite the blurry textures,\n\nIf you can buy/find it on sale like I did when I got it, it’s well worth the money, especially once you tinker with the game engine to make it look/run a little better. It’s far better then anything Gearbox has done to date I can honestly say that, it’s not a boring motionless world with singular friendly/peaceful NPCs, however it is no Fallout 3.","March 5, 2015","true","19.5"," 172 of 190 people (91%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","91","172","190","7","2"

I pre-ordered this game when it was available on Steam so I paid $59.99 for it, its now (as of this re-review) $19.99 and the one DLC is $4.99.\n\nThe game is your traditional FPS shooter game. Its heavily action packed and has lots some cool weapons. I personally found that the shotgun was the best one to use and favored that over all other weapons. There is crafting in the game as well but I find it very simplistic and only of use when you need to make items to break open locked doors, med packs or throwing blades.\n\nI did play both the solo campaign the coop and the multiplayer side of the game. I am amazed at how well this game looks and plays and the voice actors used for voicing the game characters. The graphics are also superb and very detailed and amazing to look at both scenery and attacking enemies.\n\nThe game includes an addon that wasn't originally available unless it was pre-ordered and that's the sewers to explore.\n\nWhen it was released the game wasn't what gamers were hoping it would be, an open world post apocalyptic game as the media coverage lead you to believe. Once you started playing you quickly found it to be a closed world and once you go through a mission area you can't go back and do it over to get any secrets you left behind or want to find. I didn't find this game to offer any replay value in the solo campaign at all. Don't get me wrong the first play through it increasingly good and very enjoyable.\n\nThe multiplayer side of the game is just a dune buggy race doing lap after lap and shooting at one another with mini guns and rockets. Its like deathmatch but with cars. Nothing new provided here by Id Software in this regard.\n\nThe says there is Coop play however this can be misleading because you would expect that you can play the campaign with a friend but this isn't the kind of Coop play that Rage offers. Its basically playing objective based missions with a friend.\n\nRage play's very good with the Xbox 360 controller and that is what I use for all my game play and its what I prefer over the traditional keyboard and mouse.\n\nOverall the game is totally amazing for my first impression and first play through but severely lacks for replay value. However the multiplayer and Coop play looks as if it was an after thought.\n\nIn my opinion Id Software dropped the ball on this game or turned a tech demo into a game. Not sure which. This game made Id Software look dated and relying on its old game play style hopping for success.\n\nHad the game been an open world type game with the ability to play it cooperatively then it would have been ground breaking.\n\nPro's\nAmazing Graphics\nVoiced Characters\nBladed throwing weapon\nCon's\nClosed world\nNo replay value\nCoop play is not campaign based\nMultiplay is just deathmatch play\n\nCVGAnton's Ratingːfirst_starːːfirst_starːːfirst_starː\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JGoWkx3wLQ","October 4, 2014","true","38.7"," 262 of 311 people (84%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","84","262","311","6","6"

It's another game where you find yourself exploring a post-apocalyptic wasteland performing missions for money and trying to survive— then wind up saving the world. In that sense, it feels a bit like a Borderlands game, but with a serious undertone and with realistic-style graphics. When you start to play it, though, you will find it definitely has the FPS experience of an ID game.\n\nIt isn't an open-world game really in the true sense of the meaning. But it isn't exactly forcing you from one level to the next, either. I personally found the world immersive and the story engaging. The narrative is well written, even if it relies heavily on established clichés. And I thought the graphics were quite nice; very, very nice actually— there was several times I found myself taking a moment to look around at the scenery and grab screenshots. The gorgeous visuals and interesting narrative establish an undeniably captivating presentation.\n\nAs far as gameplay is concerned: the mechanics and controls were solid, and the combat is exciting.  There is a decent amount of gun and enemy variety, but there definitely could be more. It’s enough to keep you interested, but it is certainly somewhat limited. The desire to explore more beautiful landscapes and to finish the interesting story will keep you intrigued, though, if you find yourself growing bored with the combat in the later stages of the campaign. It is certainly a decently sized game. And there are sidequests and minigames that are pretty fun if you are into achievements and extras.\n\nBesides the campaign, there is a coop multiplayer mode where you can clear dungeons with a friend. There are a good number of missions to beat and they tie into the main campaign as little background stories of NPCs and locations. It is quite fun, actually, and adds a very welcome bonus layer of content.\n\nAlso, there is a racing multiplayer mode (for which I had trouble finding games, to be honest). I was able to find a few games with a low amount of people— but it wasn't living up to its full potential. It matters little in the long run, as the rest of the game is well worth it.\n\nAnd so: if you are looking for a story-driven, atmospheric, and action-packed FPS game with a high standard of quality, you would be wise to give RAGE some consideration.\n\nFollow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!","April 20","true","45.8"," 106 of 111 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","106","111","0","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/barricadas/recommended/9200/","barricadas","Barricadas","http://steamcommunity.com/id/barricadas/","413 products in account","I've read so many things about RAGE, how it was a huge disappointment, what kind of a lacklustre game it was. I needed to give it a try and all I can say is that while the game is a lot better than its counterparts in many areas, it lacks some vital things to make the world more vivid.\n\nPros:\n- Enemy AI is great, they are responding to how you play. If you're going head on with a shotgun in your hands, they try to stay far and shoot you down with AR's or surround you with their greater numbers. If you're playing one shot one kill, they act swiftly and try to mow you down with their athletic skills.\n- Enemy variety is good. You never find yourself killing the same type of enemy all the time. Even in missions and bandit clans, variety is good.\n- Town designs are good and based on real world architecture. For example Subway Town is based on Chinese style, Jackal Territory resembles Brazilian Favelas, Dead City is the classic metropolis.\n- Different accent and characteristics for every bandit clan feels great, a lot better than any other generic bandits in games.\n- If you play stealthy, there are a lot of times where you can see how bandit clans work, how they are small military dictatorships, ruled by benevolent and paternal figures. Great insight.\n- Missions are great, especially Dead City is one of the most memorable FPS missions for me.\n- Caricature NPCs, like J.K Stiles and Dietrich are great.\n- References in the story, things that are hidden shows that this game was made with passion and the goal was to lead the player to experience the game fully.\n- Boss fights.\n- Ammo and weapon variety can make any FPS player wet, but an oldschool LMG could add a lot to the gameplay.\n\nCons:\n- Sİlent protagonist is a huge no for this kind of game. I've been asleep for years, I should speak, eat, drink, love, hate etc. I need to do things that makes me feel what it's like to be a human again. For example, one of the first missions could be getting in shape something like (Run 20 miles, do some push ups (like in GTA:SA)). The protagonist feels like a mindless robot.\n- Alienation of the protagonist continues with no personal story. Finding devices that contained data about him should have told who he was, all you get for motivation to play is "this is this, that is that, now go kill them."\n- Secondary missions could use some variety. Assassinate this guy, destroy that thing, drive for this person, try to convince someone, organize resistance, build up defences etc. would be great and very fitting for the personality as he was one of the "chosen ones" before the apocalypse.\n- NPC dialogues are weird. One step and he starts talking, one step to back, he ends talking abruptly.\n- Towns and settlements should have been more lively, developed according to your actions. For example you do one work for future expansions when you go back you should see that the town has expanded.\n- More enterable buildings could be better.\n- Subtitles inside the towns are ♥♥♥♥ed, your dialogues are interrupted with megaphone announcements.\n- Needed more quests.\n- Economy is ♥♥♥♥. You do some quest, you earn money and you give it all back to get some ammo and upgrades for the next mission.\n- Eastern Wasteland is the definition of dull. All gray with nothing interesting to see around.\n- Last mission, ending of the story was terrible, no decent closure to the story and there was no boss fight. In general it was easier than most of the other missions.\n- If more sandbox elements were added it could enhance the game incredibly (actually I suspect that they were going for this at one point, but when they were acquired by Bethesda, the plans went to ♥♥♥♥).\n\nSeems like RAGE has great potential to build upon and all of the Pros I listed are examples of great mechanics and level design. Only thing that they needed to improve upon is story and open world elements. I, personally, would be more excited about a RAGE 2 than the new DOOM.\n\nP.S: People said that they got lots of texture pop-ins that are of course pretty annoying. But for me, with my ♥♥♥♥♥♥ laptop with Intel HD 3000 and 4 GB RAM, it ran like a charm. Even explosions did not cause FPS drops.\n","August 15, 2015","true","21.5"," 94 of 104 people (90%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","90","94","104","7","8"

Everything feels unique . The graphics are incredible and the atmosphere stunning. The weapons feel satisfying and the enemy AI responsive. The enemies are not too tough , but not too easy either. The story seems interesting in the beginning too. The driving can be fun and there are options to modify your weapons and vehicles. The world seems big enough for you to explore , which is also pretty nice. The crafting system is simple and useful. Additionally , the mechanics in total feel useful .There are also plenty of mini-games you can play in order to earn some extra cash which are pretty fun. The combat system is similar to most of the shooters today, nothing special , but was made better and more engaging by specific mechanics , like the wingsticks . Overall, the first few hours spent in the game were enjoyable and the game just felt great.\n\nAfter the first few hours of gameplay,however,  the game starts going downhill. The weapons  stop feeling that great and the game starts to repeat itself just to make you feel that it's longer. The missions feel incredibly repetitive and I just felt that the only thing I was doing was to drive from point A to point B and then kill endless waves of enemies.  I also started getting really mad about my character , since I never got to even hear his voice. Even the driving started becoming extremely boring and the challenge had all been lost , since I was never pressed for ammo. There were infinite supplies of everything : grenades , bandages , ammo. The enemies stopped being interesting and handling them was just too easy. I didn't even get to finish the game , since the atmosphere and gameplay became so repetitive that drove me mad! It felt like an endless motive.. Last but not least ,the lack of cutscenes took away the immersion for me as well. It felt like the game lacked something basic , apart from the other. As a conclusion , every aspect of the game was simply ruined by the unneccesary extreme length of the storyline , which caused repetitiveness.\n\nTo sum up , RAGE is a fun shooter at first , but as you get used to the mechanics and the gameplay  , as well as the story and the mission patterns , it stops being  immersive and throws away the potential.\n\nThanks for reading and I hope that this review has been helpful!","April 12, 2015","false","8.7"," 385 of 528 people (73%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","73","385","528","13","24"

The whole linear story line holds no issues with me, there's nothing wrong with a single thread-story if it's an immerseive experience.\n\nOn the one hand, it has the same issue Farcry 2 has; it's side jobs that extend the game time are little repetative at times, popping you out of the experience & it has a typical id trait that means the character feels slightly ponderous in his movement. Not a major thing, but something I need a little game time to adapt to.\n\nHowever, that said, the combat is excellent, the AI engages in tactics that vary from one group or tribe to the next; some use melee weapons, others keep their distance, the Authority uses armour & sheilds. They use grenades, they retreat when you over power a squad, they use cover... It really holds onto you as a player. The mutants, meanwhile, are aggressive, really fast moving & resistant to injury, so you have to be accurate & prepared to retreat yourself. They crawl on any surface so appear out of no where, giving some genuine tension when an NPC tells you to go into mutant-infested locations.\n\nSecondly, the little mini-games; trump cards, gambling machines, holographic games to bet on, racing... all make it feel like there are actual communities looking for entertainment & diversions. You're not forced to engage with these, but they do add detail to the 'world'.\n\nWhile the car segments aren't the worst in an FPS, OK at best, it's the FPS part that makes the game. All the weapons have different flaws & strengths, all have various ammo types to play with that give advantages but also have drawbacks. This means you have to use your loadout rather than just use one gun as everything is useful & necessary.\n\nRemote control cars with bombs, sentry bots/turrets. emp grenades... all of these can be built using parts found laying around, plus to get a dead characters ammo, you have to 'use' them, all making the player get involved in the game, rather than just shooting anything that moves. As different groups & tribes favour different weapons, you're forced to consider what guns to use depending on who you're fighting.\n\nThe problem for Rage is that Doom 3 & id's reputation hangs around it's neck a bit, colouring what is a good story driven FPS. Give it a fair chance, put enough time in for the plot to shift up a gear, 5 hours plus at least, & it will reward you. For me, a fully filled-out world is more than just being a sandbox shooter & Rage is an example of that. It's not a top game, but it's pretty good & certainly worth spending time with.","June 21, 2014","true","17.0"," 91 of 104 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","91","104","0","0"

However, its a VERY mixed bag in terms of quality in various categories.\n\nTEXTURES:  Terrible pretty much across the board.  The game engine also mishandles the loading of the textures so that they "pop in" if you rotate your view at even a modest speed.  The pop in problem can be minimized via config tweaks, but there isn't much that can be done for the low quality assets themselves.\n\nLIGHTING:  Disappointing to say the least.  The vast majority of shadows are baked in and ugly, and the few objects with dynamically-rendered shadows (enemies, cars, etc.) only cast a single shadow from the strongest light source, leading to shadows suddenly shifting when the strongest light source changes.  The particle and distortion effects created by things like torches look great, however.  The only other lighting effects to speak of are some weak HDR and specular maps.\n\nGAMEPLAY:  Once you fix the narrow default FOV (+cvaradd g_fov 15 in the launch options), the game is great.  The weapons feel epic and you can carry ludicrous amounts of ammo for them in up to three different flavors (e.g. buckshot, pulse shot, and exploding shells for the shotgun).  The racing side of the game isn't quite as good as the shooting, mostly due to a uniform lack of variety making it something of a chore later on, but everything handles well.  In addition, this game has some of the best animation I have ever seen, particularly the enemy behavior.  They jump off of walls and combat roll in an effort to avoid your fire, and their death animations are wonderfully unique, combining scripted sequence and ragdoll physics seamlessly.  Also, quicksaves!  Every time a PC game omits a manual saving feature, a puppy dies.  Fact.\n\nRANDOM STUFF:  The mouse feels janky in the menus, but feels fine in game.  The cursor becomes almost unusable at lower sensitivities.  Also, some areas of the game get blocked off as you progress through the main story, so you'll want to complete any and all side quests you see first thing upon entering a new location.  In addition, the game could do with being a bit more difficult.  The amount of extra money and upgrades that can be found through exploration is either good or awful, depending on how OCD you are.  Lastly, this game has little in the way of replay value or endgame content, as all you can do is run the Mutant Bash arena figher thing or any of the races over and over again.  Each co-op mission is standalone and the multiplayer is racing only.\n\nI'd give this game an 8/10 overall, the absolutely incredible old-school inspired gunplay quickly makes you forget that the game looks older than Half-Life 2.  Oh, and don't even bother buying this game without the Scorcher's DLC.  The extra weapons are a riot (nailgun and railgun, the quake classics), it allows you to keep playing after you complete the final mission, so you can backtrack and do any side quests you may have missed, and it grants you access to the Ultra Nightmare difficulty, which is as close to challenging as this game gets.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jipearce82/recommended/9200/","jipearce82","Senno","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jipearce82/","755 products in account","First and foremost: RAGE is a strikingly beautiful game. Coming from iD, I would expect no less. Since the dawn of the shooter they've been at the forefront of cutting edge technology with a minimum of requirements. With new engine iD Tech 5, they've done it again - this is one of the most beautiful game worlds ever realised. It's staggering the amount of detail that can be seen in this title, from the cliffs and canyons to the exquisite characters. But for all it’s beauty, RAGE is a shooter very much stuck in the past, and while story and character have been beefed up a great deal from past iD products, they just can’t compare with shooters of today. RAGE is wonderful to play, but caring about the game world or having an emotional attachment to any character is a darn sight harder.\n\nYou awaken in the beginning from a cryo-chamber after many hundreds of years of slumber. The world has mostly been destroyed by an asteroid, and various mutants, bandits and factions now control various parts of this ‘wasteland’. Upon exiting the safe confines of this vault, noting that the other inhabitants have long since deceased, you’re attacked by a mutant and saved by a local. In short time you’re given a gun and you’re told to start shooting. As is the pedigree of this developer, RAGE is a shooter first and foremost.\n\nIt’s a very traditional shooter as well, corridors and small warehouses rule the day, and enemies jump out from the shadows and behind inaccessible doors. While the game world is at times large, this is more of a playground for vehicular destruction and transportation, getting from one location to another, and can be considered filler. While it has its moments it certainly feels like a part of the world to give it a greater ‘Mad Max’ vibe – there for the sake of being there, and it begins to lose its sheen the longer you play. However, it plays second fiddle to the shooting, and while no one could accuse RAGE of being revolutionary, it’s not held back by its lack of ambition.\n\nIn fact, because of this, RAGE’s old-school gameplay feels a little fresh, even if it’s playing to its out-dated strengths. The guns, for instance, genuinely feel powerful, and the ragdoll physics really show their strength. Shoot a guy with an arrow, and he’ll stick to a wall. Blast out their legs and they’ll flip over as they’re in full pelt. Shields crack and splatter from impacts, skulls crack open, and generally, the various guns, each with multiple ammo types, feel creative and meaty.\n\nIn addition, there are many single use items that can be crafted, found or purchased throughout the game world, such as bladed boomerang ‘wingsticks’, gun turrets, spider droids and RC bomb cars, to name a few. Occasionally you may need to be creative, with the enemy A.I being considerably good. They tend to work together, hide behind shield carrying allies, flush you out with bombs, call orders to each other, flank and generally do their best to kill you. Even suicidal mutants will jump back and forth, hop around corridor walls and ceilings, only to backstab you. The various enemies each have their own powers and weapons they favour as well, zig-zagging while they throw screen-darkening clutter at you, ducking and dodging as you’re blasting away. Thankfully, the pacing is spot on, you never feel over-whelmed, and there is always enough challenge.\n\nApart from the shooting, there are odd jobs around towns, such as blowing up bandits cars in certain areas, various race types, delivering timed mail, and even a circus like murder simulation television show where you are literally put into arenas of death. None of it is as compelling as the main quest, but it does help break up the monotony, and helps create the illusion of a living, breathing world. The detail to RAGE is exhaustive, in only the best and most obsessive point possible.\n\nThis obsession has been carried to some of the most detailed and amazing character models yet seen in any game. Sadly, they’re not all too interesting. Especially when the game attempts to shift gears and provide a sense of tension – I just wasn’t feeling it. The good guy archetype character is boring as hell, the corrupt characters as cliché’d and obvious from the start. Everyone plays their character, but there is no real personality, and there never feels like a compelling villain or even a compelling reason to your character. The world feels like it’s had far too much lavished upon it’s visuals that it’s characters have become secondary.\n\nThe faceless bandits and “Authority” you fight throughout the game might as well be very detailed stick figures with some great artificial intelligence. Fun to shoot at but why should I care? For all the amazing detail, and terrific character animations, especially by the town folk, they might as well all be playing parts in a stage play. Yet even as I played away, hoping to find a payoff, I was quite disappointed. There is no real satisfying conclusion or encounter, and it felt like I was really only fighting for my own personal entertainment rather than any emotional connection.\n\nAs of this writing, RAGE has been available for just over two years and it’s more interesting modes have been all but abandoned by gamers. The online multiplayer, once iD’s main claim to fame, is not supported, and the co-op mode, while fun, with a friend I was able to rope in, never felt like a compelling addition, just a very good one.\n\nAnd that really sums up how I feel about RAGE. It’s a game that feels rooted in the developer’s past while having the vision, the visuals, and the environment, to look towards the future. RAGE proves that iD knows how to craft a fun shooter, yet struggles to create compelling characters or even a memorable narrative. Why should I care about the town of Wellspring when I only just entered it? Despite the context, RAGE is still a blast to play. It may not be revolutionary, but its still a finely crafted shooter that is a whole heaping of fun and comes recommended as something a little old-school.\n\n8.0/10.","December 14, 2013","true","62.2"," 73 of 89 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","73","89","0","8"

Not a solid "No" but definitely not a "Yes."\n\nRAGE is, let's be clear, an old-school shooter.  In spite of slightly open visuals, most of your FPS action occurs in the same general tunnels and limited pathways that Id Software has been doing since Wolfenstein 3D.  Oh, and there's a driving/racing component which is decidedly "meh."\n\nThe IdTech 5 engine is visually reasonably pretty, but the game is, I gather, pretty poorly optimized to take full advantage of the highest resolution textures.  But to be honest, I don't find the graphics all that amazing, and graphics alone don't sway me without otherwise solid gameplay.\n\nThe story itself is pretty humdrum stuff, and ends rather abruptly.  I gather we won't be seeing a sequel, at least not any time soon, since Id is busy with Doom 4.  Honestly, it's nothing special.  Post-apocalyptic wasteland controlled by authoritarian regime (very cleverly known as "The Authority."  Yeah.).  Plucky rebel faction fights against them and sees you as their possible savior because...aw hell, I forget why.  But whatever.  You're the chosen one.\n\nYou fight alone through Id corridors using mostly typical weapons (pistol, shotgun, assault rifle, sniper rifle, etc.).  There's some variation there, but it's all the usual suspects.  The gunplay itself is kind of meh, really.  I found the sound design for the weapons to generally be kind of underwhelming.  They seem to "clatter" rather than "boom," if that makes sense.  The wingstick is kinda neat, but limited in ammo.\n\nThe minigames are generally pretty forgettable.  Gambling stuff, racing, and rhythm games, really.  Nothing special.\n\nHonestly, the game plays like an "also ran" to Borderlands, but it takes itself much more seriously and lacks any co-op component.  I'd say it's worth not more than $5.  At that rate, it's decently fun to run around and shoot stuff.  But it's a fairly disposable game and even at a $5 price tag, you won't be missing much if you skip it.","July 20, 2015","false","28.4"," 285 of 422 people (68%) found this review helpful 26 people found this review funny","68","285","422","26","8"

When the textures are at their peak they're gorgeous, and this game is a prime example of Post-Processing done right. There is an unbelievable amount of visual fidelity & attention to detail in the game that makes the environments feel seamless, believable and immersive.\n+ Fantastic animations and voice acting make for lively, genuine characters.\n+ Great enemy AI - though their banter gets repetitive, they'll duck & weave and take cover to make combat more difficult for you.\n+ Satisfying gunplay, with weapons that feel like they have some kick on account of good audio mixed with realistic enemy reactions.\n+ Linear, but with PLENTY of exploration. Don't go in expecting Fallout's expanse or Call of Duty's hand-holding; RAGE sits fairly solidly as a mid-ground between these two ends of the spectrum.\n+ The driving is actually FUN. Vehicles handle nicely, and I found myself playing all the races out of enjoyment rather than necessity.\n\n- Horrible texture pop-in, which detracts greatly from the experience in some areas where flat, mushy Play-Doh surfaces are rampant. No, your eyes aren't blurry... that's just the game's major gaping technical flaw.\n- Easier difficulty than you'd expect from some of the godfathers of First Person Shooters. I'm usually a normal difficulty kinda guy, but if you have ANY experience with FPS games then "Normal" is a vacation and "Easy" is just insulting. "Hard" feels like the definitive experience, where it's difficult enough that you'll want to experiment with everything in your arsenal, but not SO difficult that you can't rely on the basic pistol to carry you through most situations. Seasoned shooter fans will want to skip right to "Nightmare" or "Ultra-Nightmare", but even then the veterans and masochists will probably leave unsatisfied.\n- Boring soundtrack that really doesn't live up to the standard of the sound effects & ambience. It's uninspired, and frankly too loud - I turned it down, but you wouldn't be missing out on much to just turn it off altogether.\n- Pre-order DLC shenanigans. Generally this isn't an issue because the content isn't worthwhile or players can buy it afterwards, but the Anarchy Edition content is valuable and can only be obtained by hunting down a DLC code for sale or cheating. Throw Pop Rocket ammo in the Double Barrel Shotgun and you have a dual grenade launcher that makes quick work of difficult bosses, and the Fists of Rage & Rat Rod buggy are straight-up statistical improvements over the vanilla versions. The armor essentially combines the game's 3 "classes" into one, making your life in the game much easier.\n\nOn top of my playtime here, I also played on PS3 at release and achieved 100% - I bought it again to experience PC graphics and play The Scorchers.","December 28, 2014","true","9.7"," 41 of 45 people (91%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","91","41","45","2","0"

But Rage, like every property Id had created, has a shallow and generic setting, a mere framework for the gameplay it supports. And sadly, the gameplay equally lacks in innovation.\n\nThat's not to say I didn't have fun; for an action-shooter FPS, the combat could be remarkably tense, thanks to some good AI and an impressive moveset for all the enemies. The NPCs advance, take cover, throw grenades, retreat, and even try to drag their wounded carcasses out of the firefight. The fights were probably the best part of the game, which is all the more odd since the weapons you fight with are so dismayingly underpowered (in fact, the bulk of my kills were with the pistol with which you start the game). I have equally little to say in favor of the mission-based gameplay and even less about the abysmal driving segments, both of which seemed tacked on to show off the open world technology rather than for interesting gameplay.\n\nAnd what about that technology? The graphics engine -IdTech5 - excels in creating large detailed levels with sharp textures; there's no low-res skybox in this game! But it rarely takes advantage of this technology; the outdoor levels are broken apart by narrow canyons so you rarely get a feel for the expansiveness of the world. Worse, this impressive long-range detail comes at a cost to the short; close up, the models are distinctly low-polygon in comparison to those used in other modern games. In many areas, Rage looks decidedly second-class.\n\nThrow in a variety of other gaffes - serious technical issues (albeit none that effected me), uninteresting "mini-games", unskippable cinematics and a noticeable lack of content - and its not hard to understand why some are calling Rage just another Id tech-demo. It has its moments, but as a complete product it is significantly lacking.","November 25, 2013","false","27.2"," 120 of 171 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","120","171","0","0"

There's also a MP. But it's just concentrated on MonsterBashTV and some car arenas. Unfortunately it's quite laggy.\n\nHowever the end product has breathtaking good graphics, especially the 64bit version if you buy the DLC. Rumors tell the DLC "The Scorcherer's Job Path" was once included in the main game and just bought separately to make more money. Bad tongues consider the games as one unique 40GB texture because no stone seems like the other. The skybox looks just amazing.\nAll human characters including the enemies feel pretty vivent and natural in their animations. Otherwise some plants are rendered as awful 2D sprites into the 3D world.\n\nThe enemy AI is also brilliant. They act smart and take cover, flee on losses or try to jump on you. The campaign is pretty linear. You will meet several families and communities that you can join after you finished some missions for them. Some new interesting features are a quick weapon menu for 4 weapons, different bullet types, several craftable items like spider turrets and lock grinder, melee weapon wingsticks, defib unit for after death revive (max 3 times).\nRage is just an impressive graphics adventure.","September 23, 2015","true","88.6"," 52 of 63 people (83%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","83","52","63","3","0"

Each main quest involve you traversing an area like a city, a dungeon, or a tunnel to find something or kill everyone. Backtracking/sidetracking options are very limited, so there is no feeling of repetition at all.\n\nWeapon options are padded very nicely. The variety are there and not too overwhelming. Your guns are upgraded progressively, and each have their own pro and cons. Your most basic guns are still very useful near the end of the game when you have access to upgraded ammos. The crafting system is there, but I find myself only crafting a few items and ignore all the rest. The sentry bots are kinda OP though, they are very useful in a fight and their ingredients are cheap and common.\n\nThere are plenty of mini-games to explore during your main-quest downtime. There's a racing game that is actually pretty good! And there's a collectible card game where the cards are part of the game's collectible items scattered throughout the world. There's an arena for you to kill mutants for money when you just want to kill stuff.\n\nAlthough it is considered an old release now, you will still need a powerful rig to run this game.

I actually bought the physical DVD version (free after rebate!) and it was a pain getting it installed and registered with Steam. Those of you who buy the game through Steam shouldn’t have any problems though.\n\nI heard that Rage got a lot of flak when it came out because it’s from Bethesda and people thought it would be an HD Fallout game with drivable cars. Instead it’s a mostly linear shooter with some crafting elements and side quests. The graphics really reminded me of Doom 3 (ID Software developed the game) right from the start except with the game taking place mostly in the sunny outdoors.  I suppose it’s technically “open world” but there’s no built in game map, so when you’re cruising in your car you really just follow waypoints. The world’s not that big anyways though. Rage is NOT an RPG, so there is no level up system or skill point system. Instead you rely on your array of weapons and different ammo types to blast your way through.\n\nNon-spoiler story synopsis: An asteroid hits the Earth and a bunch of “arks” are seeded around the world to wake up after the catastrophe. You play one of the ark survivors waking up and exploring the post-apocalyptic world. This means mutants, bandits, and high tech “new world order” enemies. Really, the story isn’t very well explained through gameplay.\n\nKind of spoiler: There’s no final boss! You’re just playing along in the last area and after holding off a swarm of enemies the game’s over. I was surprised since I had been hording up ammo and didn’t get to use some of the special ammo I was saving up. In all I think the game took about 12 hours to finish but on this my third run I’m skipping some of the side missions. Like I mentioned earlier, there’s no level ups anyway so I won’t really be missing out on anything but story.\n\nOverall I’d give the game a thumbs up. Good graphics, a decent challenge, and pretty cheap nowadays (I think it’s about $5 on sale sometimes).

(Excpect for the shotgun. Shotgun is god, especially with the alternative ammo.\nStory starts off somewhat strong but in the end you are the maid for everything; a simple goon that does what he's told.\nEnemy variety is scarce. They may look different but behave the same. They either charge at you fast with a melee weapon, slow while shooting with heavy ordnance and armor or hiding behind cover and shooting with their forehead exposed for a clean shot.\nThe minigames are there but are neither lucrative nor rewarding.\n\nThe DLC is available early and awards you with a "one shot, one kill"-weapon. Noice.\n\nIn conclusion:\nIt's a borderline OK game, because graphics have to be improved from your side otherwise your experience is kinda "blurry".\nWorth the buy on sale but with an unsatisfying / abrupt "ending".

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RJtheShadow/recommended/9200/","RJtheShadow","il Duderoni","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RJtheShadow/","537 products in account","I am slightly conflicted when recommending this game. People may enjoy different things out of a game than I do.\nAs per usual with my reviews, I'll take my time to lay out why I recommend this game.\nI bares noting that I finished the game on the ultimate hardest difficulty, only available to owners of the Scorchers DLC.\n\nRage has a combat system that I regard as fun. Especially in the beginning, assuming you went the hardest difficulty, the game quickly plays the resource game. I was challenged often to use my ammo sparingly, keeping my real good guns for emergencies.\n\nMoney is on short supply as well, so it becomes a balancing act of fighting and earning money to cover your costs.\nThe really strong weapons, like the shotgun (which remains a solid option throughout the game) will run out of ammo fast if you only use that. Sadly, this balance can be ruined by an exploit. It's a little convoluted, but workable. I tried it and felt I ruined the experience a little bit for myself, having large stocks of ammo now. There was no way I would waste 500 shotgun shells halfway through the story. If you feel honorable enough, you can avoid doing it.\n\nThe combat itself is enjoyable. The guns feel like they have weight, and rightfully so. Hitting something with the full blast of a shotgun will annihalate a small enemy, and stun normal ones with a second killing them. Using a grenade to stun the really big enemies is a valid tactic to then unload shotgun ammo into them.\n\nBut if you play on a hard difficulty, you'll not be running and gunning. In fact, much like the enemies, you'll be looking for cover often and peak out to exploit their unfortunate positioning, if any.\nAnd if you get shot? Well, the revive mechanic is there to save you, zapping you back to life if it has a charge.\nThis is a good mechanic to balance the cheap lucky shots the enemies sometimes like to dole out.\n\nStorywise, the game is solid. It's not the best, but it tries to be comprehensible and cohesive. It feels like a potential that wasn't fully tapped into. This is noticeable in two things. One is the missions, where they objective is little more than progress through area's through, well, shooting and reaching the end. Then make your way back, often using a shortcut.\n\nBut the worst part is, however, it's ending.\nNow, I would not skip on buying this game because of it. It's literally the last mission that is completely ♥♥♥♥. You break in a facility, spend a few hallways killing and pushing buttons and then tough out a minor gauntlet. No final boss, nothing to really write home to.\n\nEverything before that mission seems fine and as the same quality as the rest of the game. Which makes it even more mindboggling. I cannot fathom why something like this was ended in such a way.\nIt begs the question if it wasn't rushed or something.\n\nThe same devs made Wolfenstein: The New Order, and I can taste some of the influences. Taking cover, the guns feeling good... But while Wolfenstein was more like a hallway shooter, pushing you forward into levels constantly, Rage has a bit of an open world aspect. Not as vast as you'd hope, but big enough to rummage around and see the sights. However, mission handling and such always happen in cities and such. Even races.\n\nRaces are moderately enjoyable, and are required to upgrade your vehicle. But all in all, they're not something that ultimately stands out as extremely enjoyable, but a good enough time waster if you feel like trying. The races vary from time trials, racing combat to hunting random checkpoints that appear on the map. The enemy AI, especially in high difficulties, can be a real challenge though. So if you want those achievements, maybe do those on a different difficulty.\n\nI found Rage a worthwhile experience. The combat and gameplay, which matters more to me, felt good. Most of the weapons fit archetypes that you should be familiar with, but most of their design fits the theme. Except the shotgun. Damn thing looks like a modern polished weapon in a world of rusty and dusted weapons. It doesn't look high tech either like the late game villain's weapons do. Odd one, that.\n\nThe exploration and story could have been better, but the atmosphere is very well done. There's lots to do, a few things to gamble in a few games, and tasks to do. The people in the cities don't repeat their lines, and often have interesting things to say. Not to mention that they seem to be all named. As if they were placed by hand.\n\nIf the positive aspects I've described call to you, then Rage may be a worthwhile experience for you as well. As a game of age, it'll now be more often on sale, so be sure to grab it at your convenience.\nAnd if you want a game where the combat also feels just as good, Wolfenstein: The New Order will be the next game I may heartily recommend.","January 24, 2015","true","27.2"," 26 of 31 people (84%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","84","26","31","2","0"

When the game was first released in 2011, the "mega textures" looked great - when it worked. Most of the time, it didn't. That ruined the game for me, and apparently many others as well.\n\nFast forward to 2015. With all the problems patched, Rage runs perfectly. Plus, it looks gorgeous - even by today's standards. In fact, I'd dare say Rage is the best looking FPS game in my opinion (even though The Order: 1886 and Battlefield have more amazing tech, Rage has incredible artistic direction).\n\nPros\n- Great selection of guns\n- Guns feel real, weighty and powerful\n- Incredibly interesting cast of characters\n- Interesting, varied and intelligent/believable enemies\n- Amazing graphics, even by 2015 standards\n- Great level design with varied levels\n- Fun distrations around town (i.e. the game's hub area), including a surprisingly addictive card game\n- Good range of difficulty levels\n- DLC that's actually worth the price!\n\nCons\n- Given the intersting array of characters, the story really doesn't live up to its potential\n- WAY too few boss battles\n- NO RAGE 2!! (Ok this isn't really a con, but we need a Rage 2!)\n\nIn summary, this is one of the finest FPS games ever made. There isn't an epic story to be told, but if you love to shoot stuff - this is as good as it gets. Old school gunplay (without any modern "gun carrying limit" BS) with new school gameplay variety and graphics.\n\nRage is a steal even at full price. If you're a fan of FPS games (or even if you're not), this is one game that needs to be in your collection.","June 12, 2015","true","25.2"," 32 of 42 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","32","42","0","0"

Are you ashamed at all of how badly you ruin tension, pacing, excitement, difficulty, level design and strategy in video game experiences?  I would have enjoyed RAGE immensely more had you not wiped your feet on the experience.  Okay, sure, the story, characters and ending were bland, but as a game, it's pretty good, and it's a beautifully optimized 10 - 16 hour experience.  The enemies are quite smart and evasive, I got to hold 10 weapons at once with varying ammo types and the baddies responded to where they were hit and were ultimately satisfying to kill.  Hell, even the driving portion of the game was phenomenal, so much so I actually couldn't wait to travel and participate in races.  Then you came in and took away what could have been intense, exciting combat and instead, gave me tunnel vision with how easy and ultimately dull you made the shooting.

Blowing off mutant heads is better than ever, and id has really kept up with the times. The gameplay here is completely unique to id.\n\nSome of the more blatant errors have to do with the balance of the weapons later on in the game. The machine gun/ironsight/cover play looks like it should work, even into the Gearheads lair, however this is not the case and suddenly you must change your strategy. Up until enemies get armor however, you can effectively just melee through the game if your aim is good enough. I was able to complete normal without purchasing bandages or saving mid-level, first time through the game. More subtle some of the maps don't make cover and terrain visually clear. Obstacles sometimes only come up to your knees, and you can jump over other stuff that's up to your thighs, it's a real pain to have to learn this in the middle of a firefight. Combat is not a place where you want to fool around with a player's ability to flow.

I can recommend the game itself because it is a lot of fun, just not on PC due to myself and everyone I know having SERIOUS issues with the game.\n\nRAGE... while it is a well done game, it is hindered by game breaking technical issues that they have not fixed and the game came out quite some time ago. If you read through the forums, you will find that a big problem with the game is the way that it caches textures with higher end graphics cards. This causes extreme pop ins for textures that really ruins how good this game looks and destroys your frame rate. This only seems to be an issue with higher end graphics cards. I have experienced this issue on the following cards: Nvidia 280GTX (and two of these in SLI), Nvidia 560 GTX, Nvidia 560 Ti, and the Nvidia 660 Ti. Normally I wouldn't bash on a game for an issue like this but for it to be such a massive and common issue really ruins this game and I can't say I would recommend it to anyone with a higher end rig because of this. Now if you have a lower end rig (ran this without any issues on a Nvidia 8800 GTX), you may be able to run this game without any problems but unfortunately there are no guarantees. I cannot recommend anyone buy this unless they are willing to roll the dice with this broken game. I really hope id Software can step it up after losing John Carmack and fix this engine.

Its a nice mix of solid shooter mechanics with racing thrown in. It mixes up the experience and keeps the game feeling interesting throughout. The gunplay really shines here. Standard fair weapons with some uniques, but each with unique ammo types and functions that feel very satisfying to use. The explosive shotgun shell rounds for instance, or the electric bolts for the crossbow to name a few. Gadgets like the wingstick are fun as well.\n\nCombat is almost always in small corridors. Larger areas are mainly for travel or vehicle comat. Its not a bad thing but rarely will you ever do your fighting out in the wilds.\n\nThe racing aspect feels pretty decent. Its got some fun challenges and upgrading your car is fun as well. It mixes the pacing up which I enjoyed.\n\nGraphics wise it has a uniuqe look. They use the mega texture technology to have no "repeating tiling textures" and for a more unique look. It does look very good, but it it lacks in other areas such as dynamic lighting, decent shadows, and high resolution textures. Still its got a very unique look compared to other games.\n\nNow the game is not perfect at all. The story and characters are very poor. The story barely exists at all.

While the game-play is about as fun as any other post apocalyptic sandbox and the art is certainly a drawing factor, it is simply not all that fun to play. It is surprising just how quickly I found myself getting annoyed at the "go fetch this" quests and overall clunky mechanics behind some of the tasks. The challenge is not apparent on any difficulty and areas that are marked by NPCs warning of the dangers that lie ahead are little more than small scripted events where you fight a dozen enemies one at a time.\nThat is not to say this is a terribly made game though. It delivers a mad max kind of vibe that seems to be trying to pull off some off mix of Elder Scrolls: Oblivion mixed with Borderlands. Quests, while predictable and somewhat unchallenging, offered some form of story progression and content delivery. Side missions like the racing ones featured in this game offer an interesting and fun diversion from the redundant primary mission progression, but were short lived and quickly showed their redundant nature as well.\nAll in all I really wanted to like this game.

Oh and also it has amazing graphics. Ending is probably going to disappoint you but it is still worth playing if you love post-apocalyptic games, shooters, looting or games with awesome visuals. I also recommend The Scorchers DLC, it includes a few new missions, a new difficulty level and a really cool new weapon.","January 30, 2014","true","43.3"," 18 of 24 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","18","24","0","0"

The color of the world is dreary but every NPC you meet is somewhat cheery and treats you like their best friend. While I love racing games and did not expect realistic vehicle behavior, Rage's MarioCart-like take is off the wall arcade. The power ups add more chaos to the racing that's already silly in comparison to the shooting. Even the shooting isn't all that good. The AI is interesting in that it seems to react to the situation, yet it's still dumb and easy to defeat. Bad missions, bad driving, and a setting that isn't coherent and reminds me that there are other similar games with much better story and tone.\n\n\nThere's probably a lot of games that have been and may be $5 on sale that I would take over Rage.\n\nThe Rocket Rally races are just random nonsense where there's no consequence for dying and bares no relation to the rest of the game.\n\nI either end up playing whack-a-mole as enemies pop out from cover or just walk up to them with a shotgun when they are crouched.

My first contact with this game was thanks to my local Game store where I picked this up second hand for only £4 (xbox 360) early last year. Within the first 5 minutes of playing I was completely absorbed and I fell in love hard. I've since had to re-purchase the game via Steam for another nostalgic playthrough and I don't regret it one bit.\n\nThe game is based in the future amongst a wasteland filled with survivors, mutants, monsters and patrol units, not to mention bandit cars. You play a character that has crashed down to the wasteland from an intelligent craft which pre-dates the war. The war that is, that turned the land into wasteland in the first place. With your andvanced Ark technology implants and a funky selection of arsenal, you play through to liberate the wasteland and help the survivors as best as you can. Shotgun, machine gun, cross bow, sniper rifle and grenade launcher are some of the weapons that the character can play with throughout the game. My personal favourite are 'boomsticks', a boomering shaped object with blades that can be thrown to cut through advancing enemy heads with the chance of the stick returning to you for another throw.\n\nThe story line and game start of very well but honestly I found the middle and ending not to live up to the first half. It was good, it was full of action but I just felt there should have been more, a bigger climax. Still I think it is well worth a play for any fps game fans. Plus it also has bonus games inside such as car racing (and fighting) plus gambling games ie cards, dice, roulette. Also has optional side missions.\n\n","December 21, 2013","true","23.2"," 17 of 23 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","17","23","0","1"

That's until you actually start playing. You're dropping into the world with the barest amount of exposition and rescued by John Goodman who within five minutes of meeting you, gives you a gun and asks you to wipe out a gang. Vehicles don't exist beyond mini-games and the odd moments where you need to traverse relatively short distances to mission "dungeons."\n\nYou ultimately join the rag tag group known as "The Resistance" who fights against the tyrannical "Authority" (honestly guys, hire a writer and come up with better names) in the most cliched manner possible. The game does have it's standouts. The gunplay feels good, the animation is excellent and blowing up other cars is enjoyable. The characters are very well constructed and they make you want to just sit and talk with them but instead are used as one-shot interactions. John Goodman's character disappears after the first hour of the game.\n\nThe game was unfortunately not everything I wanted it to be but it was still an enjoyable experience.\nGet it for $5 if you have a rainy weekend.","November 25, 2013","true","19.3"," 34 of 55 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","34","55","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DustyBronco/recommended/9200/","DustyBronco","Dusty Bronco","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DustyBronco/","378 products in account","A game with a bipolar mix of great ideas and some pretty heavy misses. I'll start off with the good, get into the mixed, then get into the bad. Overall, though, I think it's a great game.\n\nSo, the game starts off with a pretty epic cinematic of an asteroid hitting earth. You are one of the chosen few to be put into a life-sustaining pod of sorts to be released when it's safe to live again. How lucky! Everyone else in the pod died. Not lucky. In the meantime, civilization has adapted to a post-apocalyptic scenario by survivng in small pockets of the wasteland. Some people mutated, others formed gangs, and others complain about "the authority" being a general pain in the ♥♥♥. Really, they're called "the authority." This is the entire plot of the game.\n\nThe gameplay is actually great! I had followed this game for about three years before its release, and I soaked up the tidbits that they released of their design philosophy. Carmack really admired Half Life 2's weapons, in that the sound they made gave you a real sense of how powerful they are. I think the weapons are one of the best parts of this game. The shotgun has bass, and it LOOKS beautiful. The crossbow looks like a technological marvel, and the sound portrays silent but deadly. Even the crappy starter pistol portrays "Yeah, this gun is crap but it'll get the job done for the first few stages." Also, all of the weapons are fun to use. There aren't many (they all fit neatly on the 0-9 keys), but they're well done.\n\nMy favorite part of the inventory is a wingstick. It's a bladed tri-tipped boomerang with a target acquisition microchip. You sling it out (like a boomerang) and it'll do its best to locate and subtly track an enemy near your crosshairs when you threw it. Sometimes it'll bounce off walls and still manage to behead an enemy. Sometimes it'll break on the enemy and knock the wind out of them. Sometimes it cuts their head clean off and returns to you, ready to be thrown again. It's the best secondary weapon I've ever used in a video game, in both functionality and fun.\n\nAdditionally, they spent a lot of time creating a wide range of possible movements for enemies. This means that enemies are, by and large, unpredictable. The same kind of mutant will stagger and roll in one way, while another will duck, jump, roll, and then try to hit me with a stick. Also, they die in different animations. It's not as dramatic as id said ("you won't see the same animation twice" was really overshooting it) but it's nice detail.\n\nAlso, the car aspect of the game deserves a lot of praise. It's post-apocalypse, so of course everyone attached rocket launchers to their cars. You get homing rockets, and can explode bandits' cars - and the explosions are beautiful. The cars also handle really well with a controller. To be honest, this game's car sequences could have been an amazing game on their own. You have a regenerating speed boost, you have kneecapper tires, upgradable car armor, multiple cars to pick from, car races (time trial, normal race, rocket combat race, and a neat kind of "point" race). The game left me wanting more of the car content.\n\nNow, for the mixed...\n\nIt's clear the devs didn't really know what they wanted this game to be. It's a fun FPS with a really fun driving experience, but the racing aspect kind of gets dropped after an hour of gameplay (at which point driving just gets you to the next FPS objective).\n\nAlso, it wants to take itself really seriously as a shooter. Stealth? Aww yeah, wingsticks and the crossbow are silent, go ahead and have fun - the game actually explicitly encourages it. Except there have been multiple occasions where I've been sneaking and enemies know the split second an ally silently dies across the room, or enemies in one area KNOW where I am and where I will be coming from even though I'm crouching silently. This is paint-by-the-numbers stealth. You'll stealth where the game wants you to stealth, and even that is kind of half-baked. The crossbow is fun but just not viable unless it's the first enemy in an area, which is a shame.\n\nNext, the areas are VIVIDLY beautiful. They've put so much effort into making detailed canyon lighting, ambient graffiti and statues, and just general neat touches that make everything come alive. But everything looks good from a distance. When you get up close, you'll notice the textures have this weird black dot patterning (examples are in my public RAGE screenshots). I'm running a "great" (RAGE-rated) Nvidia GPU with the latest drivers. I think it's just an afteraffect of id's grand idea of "megatextures" which seems to have been ahead of its time. That's another topic, and I won't get into it - this paragraph pretty much sums up its relevance. There's also massive texture pop-in if you use mouselook, and that's never been resolved. Oh well.\n\nLast, but not least, the bad parts of the game...\n\nAreas are shockingly linear. You will see slabs of rock that are reasonably sized for jumping. You will see paths in levels that you could reasonably assume you could go down.  Maybe there are a few doors you could force open, or something you could climb if you actually tried. No. The game has ONE path that you will always take, and it's frustrating. The game is about exploration in story, but it's really not in actual gameplay. This is made worse by the fact that they hide collectibles - cute nods to past id games, collectible cards to boost your ego, and crystals meant to be sold for money - off the beaten path. Actually, not so much "off the beaten path" but "on the one path you're allowed, to the side where you have no reason to look." Again, it's "exploration by the numbers." You'll explore the way they want you to. Even in a town, you can't save time by jumping around. You need to walk down the stairs, down that one corridor, down the other stairs - it's like I'm playing a responsible citizen simulator. Let me jump 10 feet over those stairs. Let me jump this 2 ft high wall along the corridor. I need to waste so much time wandering around a town with no guidance, the least you could let me do is save some time.\n\nNext, the game will just NOT work on an AMD GPU. On release it worked with terrible performance, and within a few patches (and despite tweaking it as much as I could) the game would NOT run on a mid-level AMD GPU. The game relies on CUDA cores. If you're not playing with an Nvidia GPU, you're going to have a hard time. They never fixed that.\n\nAlso, the game was sold with the promise of day-one mod support, which was an outright lie. Mod tools were not made public available for (iirc) three years after the game's launch. If there was day-one support, as promised and advertised, the community could have done some wonderful things here. As it stands, it seems that most people have just moved on from this game, and that's honestly a shame. Based on the footage they released, the mod tools looked great.\n\nThe last gripe I have with this game is the multiplayer. Let's see. id software...kings of the FPS genre. A FPS game. That means the multiplayer is going to obviously be...half-baked vehicle combat!! Wait, what? There's no kind of TDM or even just campaign co-op (although I think this is undoubtedly best done as a single-player experience). Instead, the game has vehicle combat in circular maps, which is really an odd direction for it to have taken. I know that I praised vehicle gameplay, but this doesn't relate to any kind of racing. It's literally car deathmatch free-for-all, which is enjoyable up to a point, but really just ill-fitting as the only multiplayer offering. There's also co-op in a number of sort of vignettes of game areas stripped of context and filled with tough enemies. That's cool, I guess. There was never really any driving force to try that other than achievements (and even at that, I just gave up on it). The game's multiplayer has been dead since three months after the game's release, so...","September 18, 2014","true","48.4"," 21 of 32 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","21","32","0","0"

Do I have to kill him? Should I? He's not threatening to me, not right now at least. Even if I block his path he doesn't attack, he just stops and looks at me until I step aside.

Most of the problems it had were fixed, but it still feels like a console game. And playing on PC, that is unacceptable.\nIf you're able to get past the graphical issues, Rage is a very well made game. Think of Borderlands but without the RPG stuff: that is Rage. At first it may seem like an average game, but as you play it you'll discover that it's a lot of fun and it has a strange charm that will hook you up before you know it. I can't tell where that charm comes from, because thinking back, it's not better than similar games like the mentioned Borderlands, but it's still fun, which is what matters when playing a game.\nSure, it's rough around the edges, not for perfectionists, but if you play a game to enjoy it, trust me, you will like this game. Also, if you have the chance, get the Scorchers DLC, it makes the game better and adds content to the endgame, which the original was missing.","June 28, 2015","true","33.5"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

The only hope for humanity to survive this event is to burrow down to ground with these Arks and submerge when the Earth is habitable again.\nYou are one of those survivors who were selected to enter one of the Arks. You submerge from the ground in the year 2135, only to notice that all your fellow Ark colleagues to be dead from the Ark malfunction and that the Earth has become a savage place, filled with raiders, mutants and things that has a dendency to kill you.\n\nThe main story is somewhat average. It starts very strongly and keeps you in its grasp, but the ending was a little disappointment and anti-climatic for me. Not only that, but the ending also had a huge cliffhanger.\n\nGameplay:\nThe game is somewhat similar to the Borderline series, mixed with some Fallout's apocalyptic atmosphere. You can scavenge the world for items, which you can then use to build different items, depending what recipes you've discovered.\nThe game has main quest line which you can follow, but there are also several side quests, which offers you money that you can then spend at vendors for items and car parts.\n\n\nPros:\n+ Apocalyptic world and locations\n+ Infranty and vehicle mechanics\n+ Vendor system\n+ Crafting system\n+ Interesting characters\n+ Strong story, but...\n\nCons:\n- ...Anti-climatic and gliffhanger ending\n- Main story is kinda short\n- Lack of character progression\n- Stealth gameplay could have been better\n- Not as challenging as I would have hoped\n\nDo I recommend?\nYes. It has it's shortcomings, but if you enjoy playing apocalytic games, you'll probably enjoy this one too.\n\nVerdict: 8 / 10 - Good game\n( 1 = do-not-bother game\n5 = average game\n10 = must own game)","May 18","true","14.8"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","0"

Yes, you must follow the given format to complete tasks and levels but they also can be varied in actual excecution (You don't have to do what you are asked or told to do in the order given). Plus you can upgrade and vary upgrade choices as you go which is made much easier once you establish the best way to make money quickly to make purchases.\n\nFor 'Hints' and 'Bonus' material please refer to my guides section for this game to learn more. There is quite a deal of information there that will assist with gameplay and the acquisition of money required to purchase upgrades.\n\nIn short 'Rage' is a great game that can be left alone for a while and comfortably returned to at a later date and played again and again.\n\nGreat graphics, good story line and flexible playability. Extra DLC's would be great to expand this game as it lends itself to more missions.\n\nFirst time through took some 30 - 40 Hrs and this will vary depending on how much or how little you feel you want to do. The game is extremely flexible and I would rate it 9/10.\n\nI have uploaded many screenshots that will giva an indication of what to expect.\n\nHave fun.","February 22, 2014","true","893.8"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

I gave it a "yes", but hear me out first: It's good if you're expecting DOOM, with a tiny bit of open world that was injected in. If you're actually looking for a game based on it being open world, then this is not the game for you.\n\nThis is DOOM. With the added freedom of a tiny bit of exploration (though there's not much to discover... at all) and some racing aspects, which was.... fine, let's say.\n\nMy reasoning\nLet's just go through the cons first.\n\n* Graphics, although nice, were poorly executed (ie. pop-ins)\n\n* The "open world" isn't much of an open world. At all.\n\n* The characters had SO MUCH potential, but they all ended up kind of dull. Like some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ 90's caricature, but without much personality.\n\n* Story wasn't very interesting, and didn't have much explained.\n\n* Without spoiling anything for you, the ending was... well.... it wasn't much of an ending. I was saving up all my best weapons, and then suddenly... the game's over. It did not feel like an ending. No boss fight. The final quest felt like just any other side quest.\n\nWith that aside, I want to say that, with the exception of that last point, as well as the point about texture pop-ins, those flaws are okay and can be overlooked.. IF you treat the game like DOOM. I played it on nightmare difficulty, and I have to say it was just as fun as DOOM itself. It really was. It also came with a few mini-games which I thought were also terrific. The racing aspect of it is no Need For Speed, but it's still a nice addition, and was enjoyable.\n\nSo to recap: if you're looking for something like Fallout, turn away now. If you're looking for something like DOOM, however, I highly recommend it.","May 8","true","19.2"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

Let's take some common misconceptions out of the way from the get go: Rage is NOT an RPG game and it's NOT an "open world" game. Its design is mostly reminiscent of games such as "Quake II" or "HeXen", which used hub levels. In Rage, the wasteland is the hub level. Long story short - the game is an FPS full of action, as expected from id Software.\n\nWhat I really liked about the title is that despite features taken from modern shooters (iron sights, regenerating health) they don't really define the gameplay. You can switch off regeneration via the game console and iron sights aren't really needed - I beat the whole game using solely HUD cross hairs. If you REALLY want a challenge, I highly recommend id.dav81's fantastic "Rebalance Mod", it's hard though, you've been warned.\n\nThe gunplay is excellent - weapons "feel" just right and enemies react to being shot accordingly to the wound's location. The graphics and music are also on a very high level - the atmosphere of post-apocalyptic wasteland and its danger is palpable.\n\nThere is plenty of additional side-quests and mini-games to try, but their number is well balanced not to divert the player's attention from the game's focus - action. They help in building the atmosphere and immersing the player, that's all.\n\nThe only downside is the ending of the game. It feels rushed and not thorougly thought through. However, at the time of this writing (September 2014) Rage is still the best single-player FPS game I have ever played. Great graphics, balance and, most importantly, gameplay. The ending didn't change my opinion, because in this game's case the journey truly is a reward in itself.\n\nI wholeheartedly recommend it to all fans of FPS games.","September 25, 2014","true","263.6"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

The ending is unfortunately quite underwhelming. If you get a nice weapon towards the end of a campaign, you expect to be able to use it, right...well I think they may have missed the mark there.

Enemies movements will test your shooting skills, like few games do, and crafting system will need your creativity to choose the right strategy for every fight.

John Carmack and John Romero have created such legacy for themselves that their promises and opinions are to be taken seriously today, even after all the years that have passed since they went their separate ways. So when John Carmack lets it be known that he is about to deliver a shot heard round the world it is quite understandably taken as an accurate description of future events.\n\nRAGE is known to most gamers rather from the circumstances surrounding it than the actual game itself. To call the pre-release buzz a hype is a true understatement. Many believed the hype only to be disillusioned on release, with "is this it?" being the collective response. And as history has shown, the reaction was justified since RAGE came and went without impacting much of anything, let alone becoming legend. Now that the circumstances have changed a quiet appreciation has grown around the game as it it taken for what it is and not what it's creators meant it to be.\n\nThe world has ended and the player character awakens to a wasteland, as is custom, and meets the people and the factions that have survived or emerged in the meanwhile. Unfortunately there is no imagination or surprise involved in any of this. There are The Raiders, The Authority (!) and The Resistance as well as The Mutants and finally the common folk. Everything is so generic and lifeless that the names in capital letters are also the only description required. Even more unsettling is listening to the NPCs talk. An abstract, Lydia-like cheer has descended on the survivors and not a single line of dialogue sounds like actual speech. A vendor says "All my stuff is A-one premo" in an attempt to simulate humanity with literally everything else being poorly disguised information about the game mechanics involved. Fortunately the protagonist is just as wordless as Gordon Freeman or the Doom Marine before him so there are no attempts at drama. The main story is so straightforward I am hesitant to call it a story and all the characters are merely their occupations. There are no themes introduced or points made. And although many many women dress extremely impractically to say the least there is absolutely no romance or sex anywhere, not even married couples among the NPCs. All the writing involved in RAGE is words, nothing more, and my mood always soured when I had to stop playing the game and listen to the people in it.\n\nWhat makes the world of RAGE even more unwelcoming are the excruciatingly slow and dull opening hours. There are so few places to go, weapons and tools to use and things to do that it takes some self-discipline to soldier on. This is undoubtedly where the synthetic if not downright artificial nature of the world shows its very worst. Fortunately the first day of gaming is misleading: as the world in which you can wander in gets bigger the game gets better as well. The farther away I proceeded from settled areas the more I enjoyed myself. The levels are highly linear but well-designed and even the typical ruins and bunkers are interesting to explore. I was most impressed by the ruins of a great city that felt like nothing had been spoken in them for decades. Exploring these streets was the equal of any other post-human gaming experience and conveyed more meaning than any amount of words could have done.\n\nWhile all the characters are just happy automatons they were at the least well-made automatons and much thought has clearly gone into them, despite well-known influences showing here and there. The animations were exemplary in many cases, especially those of the melee chargers found on many levels. Mutants charge forward in berserk parkour and should they get decapitated they keep running for a few more paces until realising that they have died not a moment before.\n\nThe gameplay in RAGE is the traditional first person shooting seen many times before and since. It is made enjoyable by the large variety of weapons and quick-use items as well as the enemy behaviour. Only those equipped for close combat will charge forward, while those with firearms shoot from behind cover and finally retreat and regroup at the next defensive position with fresh troops coming in as well. Enemies will also get visibly injured and hobble around in pain or shoot from a sitting or lying position in their last moments. Doing this to the bad guys requires of course appropriate tools and RAGE delivers. There is a large arsenal and while it mostly consists of time-tested pistols, assault rifles and shotguns they universally look, sound and feel good in use. The basic ammunition types are nothing compared to the specialist ones you need to craft or buy at a high price. My personal favorite was the crossbow with four different types of bolts. One of these variants was a mind control crossbow bolt which lets an enemy to be walked to his comrades in remote control to be then exploded by a button press. This is one of the best But Of Course weapons in recent memory and there is undeniable glee in using it. The craftable quick-use items are even better and I was able to use most of them at a constant rate which is to say I appreciated the system very much. The first one accessed is the Wingstick, a throwable weapon looking something like a cross between ceiling fan and huge shuriken. It has limited guidance in flight and will return to the source to be used again later. Decapitating a charging mutant with one and retrieving the implement gave me a self-esteem boost against my better judgement.\n\nControls felt natural and all the menu systems were ideally clear and informative. It is most unfortunate how blurred things can look on close inspection, especially the clutter items. RAGE looks great in motion, however, and my game was a stable one as well. There is a command console and mod support for the technologically skilled. I used a keybind to hide my HUD and weapon to take screens as my only modification. A full third of my 300+ screens are from my RAGE playthrough which is certainly a testament to my gaming experience as a statistic alone.\n\nRAGE has one major DLC, The Scorchers, which merits a separate mention. It plays to the strenghts of the base game, with spectacular level design and highly intense gunfights. The story is kept to the bare minimum, thankfully, and the missions are well integrated on the main campaign. The weapon added is also one of the very best available, useful but well-balanced and with three distinct forms. The titular Scorchers also feature some of the most amusing battle chatter available and must be quoted here. Melee berserkers tell you that they love you during their charge and shooters remind themselves of their "Happy place!" when wounded. Should a comrade fall the survivors exclaim in sorrow "We lost what's-his-name!" and remark how the player needs more therapy. All in all The Scorchers is a highly polished addition to RAGE, equaling the finer levels in the base game and even surpassing them in places.\n\nRAGE is one of those games that feel better out of context. It did not change the course of game design and will not give gamers reason to reinterpret the enjoyable hobby in question. But it is beyond any doubt a well-made shooter experience, carrying on certain traditions and expanding on others, all the while being an imaginary world well worth the visit if only for the places alone.","January 23, 2014","true","31.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","1"

The wasteland environment looks gorgeous both in the way it has been designed and the graphics itself which easily helps with emersion. There are perhaps a few iffy textures when it comes to some of the interior levels, but if you can look past that and enjoy the wasteland, it's easily cancelled out. The character models and weaponary also look fantastic.\n\nApart from the main story, the game offers some decent side missions, events and numerous amounts of things to collect. Schematics, recipies (these allow you to craft various things as long as you have parts), collectables, mini games, stunt jumps throughout the wasteland and of course, racing events where you can earn racing certificates to be used in upgrading your vehicles. There are also various ammo types you can use with your weapons.\n\nThere's a few co-op missions you can do with one friend or a random. They're fun, but unfortunately a little short. There's also multiplayer by way of racing, but as to be expected, the multiplayer portion has fizzled out.\n\nThe ending could be viewed as somewhat disappointing in the fact that it's left rather open and perhaps there could have been some stronger emphasis on the story, but all small negatives considered, the gameplay is solid, the graphics fantastic and there's plenty to keep you busy with for quite some hours. Having played three playthroughs of RAGE on Normal, Nightmare and Ultra Nightmare, I can say I thoroughly enjoyed the game each time.","April 17, 2013","true","94.7"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/8799644/recommended/9200/","8799644","Vegetarian Atheist","http://steamcommunity.com/id/8799644/","507 products in account","I remember hearing and waiting for this game back in '08. I actually remember them announcing that Rage would be coming out sometime in April, 2009. Yeah, that's how long I've been waiting for this game. Long and behold, it's finally here.\n\nFor those who didn't know, this game occupies 3 DVDs. That's right, the game weights 21 GB. Well, at least Sony's Blu-Ray format doesn't have that problem. I am also extremely glad that the developers didn't trim down the game so it could fit on one DVD (you know, if it can fit on one DVD for the Xbox, then it can fit anywhere, kind of like what happened with the trimming down of the GTA 4 world map because of the DVD format.)\n\nAnyways, the new engine is astounding. The textures are amazing, especially the faraway ones. I get a stable 60 FPS with my Fermi, 8 GB Ram and 2.93 icore. It is very nice to see a new engine and not some re-used or re-updated albeit old inherently engine like Unreal 3.0.\n\nHowever, do not expect this game to be open-worlded in the same sense that Fallout 3 and New Vegas are. The world seems large but you are only confined to small and medium sized areas. As you play, more of these areas become available and you can go back if you want to, but this game is mostly linear when it comes to navigating the world itself.\n\nThere is not enough exploration to go around but I absolutely love the environments - none of the environments repeat. I love the abandoned buildings, hotels, sewers, back alleys and such. It is something that I always wanted to experience in the last two Fallout games but couldn't because of the lack of the said environments, because of the recycled areas with the same textures and objects and because of the outdated engine. This time however I can't stop taking snapshots via Fraps and Steam.\n\nThere are several types of enemies. Some of the punks however speak with a British accent and have British flag tattoos, but most of them look the same (a homage to Mad Max and Doomsday (2008) perhaps?). There are some other medium and large-sized mutants.\n\nI like the fact that there are several vehicles and that you can customize them. There are also several ammo types for each weapon, however all I really ask for is for head shot to equal instant death, which is not the case in this game unless you use a shotgun up close.\n\nYou can also create some new items that will help you advance in the game as well as access some closed off areas so do not hurry to sell every junk you find because you might need it.\n\nAs far as the weapons are concerned, well I'd say that most of them get readily available within the first few quests, so you do not really have to work hard to get them. Plus the ammo is not that scarce for some reason, so do not expect any Metro 2033-kind lack of ammo. Also, half of the weapons look like they were taken from Crysis. I would also expect some weapons to be home-made.\n\nThere' s no way to skip the occasional cut scenes or hurry up the monologue, BUT if you take a few steps away from the person giving you the quest, then the quest becomes readily available without you having to hear the whole story.\n\nThe enemy AI is good. They dodge bullets, take cover, retreat, advance and throw grenades - everything that you really need. It is also satisfying to blast some of the melee-wielding enemies. They don't always rush at you either, they actually try to surround you.\n\nThis brings me to another point. The gameplay itself is what truly shines in this game. The fire fights and the shooting just do not get old. It is extremely satisfying to fight the hordes of mutants. You can craft sentry turrets and sentry bots(like in Doom 3) to help you out. You can also craft various types of special ammo, and since there's no weight limit, there's little reason to sell junk that can be used to construct the dozen or so different things.\n\nWhen you die, the nanomachines that were implanted in you moments before the asteroid collision and the subsequent hypersleep serve as a defibrillator. Meaning if you die, you can revive yourself once or twice before the defibrillator recharges. There's a tiny minigame involved that determined how much health you get once you are revived. And by health I mean how red your screen is before it turns normal since the game has regenerative health.\n\nThe characters you encounter are all unique. They all have different clothes, voices and personalities. Some give you new quests, some just do small chit-chat. The secondary characters even have names.\n\nThere are some easter eggs scattered around including a few that pay respect to Fallout, like the bobble head and the water purifier chip.\n\nThe minuses:\n\nLet's get this out of the way: You can't see your legs and you cast no shadow.\n\nOh, and you are also mute. All you can do is listen.\n\nI like the fact that you do not have any maps or minimaps when you enter new unknown areas ( I don't like excessive HUD), but friendly towns could use some indicators because it causes some confusion when you enter a new friendly place and are trying to navigate between the newly introduced characters and quests.\n\nWhen you drive a vehicle you get a third person view, however you cannot look around or behind you which really constricts your view.\n\nThe sky looks amazing although it is static. It's like a giant wall paper.\n\nThe dead bodies disappear quickly, but at least they won't do so unless you loot them. So if you want to increase realism, do not loot the bodies.\n\nI don't think I've encountered a single checkpoint or an auto-save. That's right, your entire progress depends on your manual F5 saves, what's more is that every time you save, it takes 4 seconds for the screen to unfreeze. Annoying but necessary. So if you forget to save and die, you will have to repeat your last progress from your last save.\n\nThe game is also extremely easy. I'm playing on the hardest (Nightmare) mode and I steam roll over everyone and everything. The quick regenerating health is part of the issue.\n\nThe most important thing is the lack of a good and consistent story. This game nailed almost everything but the main story. You wake up from cryosleep and you get thrown into the semi-open world of fetch quests. For some reason people around you assume that you are a killing machine who is able to take out hordes of enemies and fetch supplies. No one ever explains why you should be doing the things you are doing. One might think that there is no need for one coherent story in the huge 21 GB single player post-apocalyptic world but I beg to differ since this is not an open-world game. You cannot bypass quests and go wherever you want, there ARE constrictions.\n\nOverall, the game feels like playing a Mad Max movie with the elements of Borderlands, Fallout, and Some Metro 2033 elements. But that is not to say that any ideas were stolen or re-used for this game. Rage is its own kind of animal, it is unique and it's got plenty of peculiar style. The world is believable and immersive. And the game itself gets better and better as you play it.\n\nHighly recommended.\n","November 27, 2013","true","47.8"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

When you get into your first town area, it’s hard to find your way around the area and can take up time, me personally I don’t want to get lost and waste time trying to find a place where I need to be. However in the towns, you have a lot of stuff to do, such as go to the merchants and buy ammo, items for building items and also you can play mini games to earn extra money in the game. They is also a race events that you can attend to which gives something extra to do in the game and something to complete.The ending of the game seems dull and could have been better and could tell more information on what happened.\n\nThe graphics towards the game is amazing with a lot of details towards the scenes with shooting and driving around in the care.\n\nThe mechanics of the game for me personally were hard to get used, but eventually I got used to them, they even easier with a controller. Driving is fluid, walking is fluid and both seem realistic.\nThe game reminds me of Borderlands and a slight hint of Fallout, with rage having it’s own elements towards the game.\n\nI am happy with buying this product and would recommend this to anyone who enjoys shooters with a different atmosphere.","January 12, 2013","true","13.5"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

The shooting is awesome, the variety in weapons is neat, and the enemies are apocalyptically crazy! For whatever reason, I had the profound thought when I first started this game that the shooting just felt really good. It felt comfortable and just great in general, beyond what other games have done.\n\nThe driving works well enough, and blowing up enemy cars is always awesome, but there's just a little something missing that keeps it from being great. It was neat to get to use my apocalyptic car to race others, it was a good change of pace sometimes from blasting psychos and mutants. I enjoyed that I could customize my car up a bit, adding upgrades and changing out weapons and such.\n\nThe world is kind of open, but not in the way The Elder Scrolls or Fallout or Far Cry are, it feels much more linear than that. The places where you can drive feel open but like there are only certain paths to take. Each area you explore on foot has some room for a little side exploration to discover hidden stuff, but it doesn't have the same sense of adventuring as other games do. You can do whatever you want, but there isn't much more to do than shoot up your enemies.\n\nTo make up for what I'm going to say next a bit, the game does have a unique storyline, interesting characters, and the graphics are really beautiful. It was interesting listening to the voices of all the variety of characters, they had neat dialogue and were voiced well. Unfortunately, even though the characters were neat, the game just couldn't make you care less about what was going on, why you were doing what you were doing, or make you want to care about any of the characters. The storyline is unique, but it wasn't done well enough that it gripped you.\n\nOverall, it's a fun game and definitely worth your time, but there is definitely potential for so much more.

It feels like started out like a great game, but the developers got bored with it.  Rage plays alot like borderlands, but without the fun of co-op, building a skill tree through level progression, or finding better/interesting weapons.\n\n-The vehicle combat in the game is pretty stagnant and just ends up feeling like a chore when driving from place to place.\n\n+There's some content to explore outside the main story; a handful of sidequests/jobs and mini-games that might keep you busy for a little while, but have no real impact on the game.\n\n+The combat can be chaotic fun, the game offers a variety of ways to kill baddies.  There are a handful of interesting boss fights.  Some environments can be used to your advantage to surprise enemies with fire, electricity, spinning blades, etc.  There's no way that's really significantly better than the others at dispatching enemies, however it can be fun to use these things in combination.  My personal favorite toy in the game was the sentry bot.  The only disappointing part to combat was that it was too easy.  I played through the game on normal and NEVER used a healing item because your health regenerates quite quickly.  And if you do die, your character has a built in defibrillator that will instantly revive you (as well as killing surrounding enemies).  So I would highly recommend playing on a harder difficulty setting.\n\n-If you're looking for a good story, this is NOT the game for you.  Where the environments are interesting and varied; the story is very vague and un-engaging; it merely exists as a medium so the game can pit you against seemingly endless waves of enemies.  The ending of the game is by far the most disappointing aspect of the game. (Minor SPOILER ALERT:  there is no final boss, just a few waves of easy enemies.)  The game ends just as the story is getting started.  You have no real choices or impacts upon the world.  Your experience through the game will be the exact same as everyone else, which is why I'm not recommending the game.  I paid $5 for this game on a sale, and I wouldn't advise you to spend a penny more than that on it.","January 14, 2014","false","24.8"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

I bought this game expecting a fallout-esque post apocalyptic adventure game from reading the reviews, and what I got was more along the lines of a modern DOOM with the look and feel of fallout, with the dungeon design of Oblivion/Skyrim.\n\nand what do I mean by that... well: The game is set in a post apocalyptic wasteland after an asteroid has struck earth, there are people buried in things called "Arks" much like the vaults in fallout. The guns, landscape, and enemies you face scream fallout.\n\nso the gameplay: Not fallout at all... I almost feel like the ability to aim down the sights of your gun is out of place in this game. It is extremely fast paced, I equate it to DOOM or another oldie FPS because I spent a good 90% of the game running around with a shotgun and my boomarang knives rather than hiding behind cover waiting for a headshot, and I am perfectly fine with that. I can't really describe the rush of throwing a wingstick at an enemy for the first time to have it take off their head and come back to you perfectly, It did not get old.\n\nand the level design: I really enjoyed the level design and it reminded me first and foremost of Oblivion style dungeons. That is to say that they were very straight-forward and hard to get lost in and wrapped around themselves wonderfully so that there was no backtracking to get back out. One thing you might frown upon is that you get sent into the same dungeons multiple times, even if they do send you through different paths and give you different enemies to kill, it seemed a bit lazy on some of the levels, but was executed perfectly on the Dead City level.\n\nThe overworld is boring, The car segments boring - but take this with a grain of salt because I hate pretty much all racing games except MarioKart\n\nThis game gets a thumbs up at it's discounted price which I got it with the DLC for 6,24$  I really wouldn't recommend it for any more than 15$ because it is only about 10-15 hours of good gameplay, unless you love twisted-metal-ey racing","October 24, 2014","true","12.3"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","10","16","0","0"

To id's credit it is a creative game that has solid, smooth combat and great weapons and enemies, one of the smoothest running engines I've ever played, and also great sound effects. It has great graphics (besides the god awful mushed textures up close) and very nice presentation value and is a lot of fun to play. The combat is really very good, top notch. One big thing that makes combat so awesome is that all weapons sound very good. The weapons sound loud and hard hitting, especially when I blow a guy into outerspace with a point blank shotgun blast and it kabooms in my ears through my headphones.\n\nid software worked with Bethesda so Bethesda had some say in it and probably nudged them towards making it a wasteland game like Fallout 3 since it was so wildly popular at the time. That's OK, but I miss the evil satanic neo-gothic stuff from Doom and Quake. It also has a horrible last boss and ending. You do many things and craft and quest and so on, then the game just ends. But id knew they ♥♥♥♥ed that up and there's an expansion that lets you play even after the final boss.\nThis game was an experiment for id to showcase their new engine which is incredible, as I said one of the smoothest game engines I've ever seen. It performs flawlessly. Although the graphics are beyond horrible in some areas, like ground and stationary surface textures. Just a blurry mess. Actually you know what, the graphics in this game just suck balls, period. Fantastic art direction, suck balls graphics quality. Oh and if there is one thing that id absolutely cannot do, it is racing. The racing parts in this game just ♥♥♥♥ing suck and are horribly sleep inducing. Also, the mouse pointer in game menu's, all of them, never feels right. It just doesn't move normally, but loose and crappy.\nDespite the games numerous merits, it doesn't live up to id's standards when you compare it to Doom and Quake 1-3. It was like they said "we are going to create a good game even if it kills us" and to their credit, they did that, but therein lies the argument that prevented this from being their next mega-hit. But RAGE holds it's own for what its worth: a wasteland FPS with very solid mechanics, a phenominal game engine besides the suck balls graphics, and not much else to complain about other than id's standardized approach to it's production quality.\nLets just hope that John Carmack didn't leave id software because this game and future projects are what their production mentality is starting to curve towards. Let's hope that we actually see them bring back the magic when they put out Doom 4.\n7.5/10","November 21, 2014","true","15.0"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","11","18","0","0"

It uses the company's OpenGL-based id Tech 5 game engine and was released in October 2011.\nThe game is set in a post-apocalyptic near future, following the impact of the asteroid 99942 Apophis on Earth. The game has been described as similar to the movie Mad Max 2 and to video games such as  Borderlands.\nThe mixture of FPS shoot and loot based missions and demolition derby type racing is just enough to be entertaining, if you get board of the same go to point [A] and kill random bandits to recover some junk missions you can enter a race, zoom round a circuit and bash and crash your way across the finish line to earn more upgrades.\n\nIn RAGE's story, the asteroid 99942 Apophis impacts the Earth on August 23, 2029, leaving few survivors. Human survivors have come together to form settlements around oases and other practical or habitable locations, including race tracks. These fragile homes are diligently defended by the inhabitants against bandits and mutants, which are divided into various gangs and organizations of their own.\n\nRAGE has two multiplayer modes: "Road Rage" and "Wasteland Legends". In Road Rage, up to four players compete in a free-for-all match that takes place in an arena designed to make use of the vehicles. The objective is to collect rally points that appear around the arena while killing your opponents and stealing their points. Legends of the Wasteland is a series of two-player co-op missions based on stories that are heard throughout the single-player campaign.\n\nSo aside from the basic gameplay and plot overview my personal opinion on rage is to give it a go, even just a few casual missions and there are fun or get right into the game and get all those delicious achievements.\nIf you find yourself really getting into the RAGE universe, Bethesda and Dark Horse Comics announced a three-issue comic book series based on RAGE, also there is an entire novel based on RAGE game.\n\nEnjoy killing bandits and making the roads a safer place, but watch out for Mutant's...\n","November 25, 2013","true","48.2"," 20 of 36 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","20","36","0","0"

This game feels like a watered down Borderlands, with the exploring and shooting fun. Not too much stuff to do, but the game is at a short, good length. I would say 10-15 hours should take care of it.\n\nThe game plays like an ordinary FPS, running through places, shooting things. the game takes place in two separate hub locations, which branch off into different areas. The shooting is great, but the exploration is lacking. There really isn't much stuff to look at, making any collectibles and stuff pointless. The base game is quite enjoyable. It's just a normal shooter in a semi open world, don't expect anything more. There is a lot of racing sequences and driving, so be prepared to do some races and car combat if you want to get anywhere in this game.\n\nThe multiplayer.....uhh.. The co-op missions are quite fun, but there's only a few of them to do. The road rage multiplayer is passable, and it's basically a ripoff of Twisted Metal.\n\nThis game is beautiful, but suffers pop-in textures. Luckily, no matter how good your computer is, it should run very well. I have a terrible computer and I was able to run it in 60 FPS. This game is excellent, but don't set your expectations too high, because RAGE can only jump so high.","November 29, 2013","true","7.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

At first when I started, the opening sequence blew me away, the graphics looked sharp, art design and every graphical fidelity was top notch. I could see vast landscapes, people, bandits running around in their buggeys and all sort of ♥♥♥♥ and It made me super hyped up that I want to explore every bit of it. However that soon came to an end.\n\nPros\nThe game looks stunning considering the fact that it came out 4 years ago. It does an awesome job of introducing new combat mechanics and enemy types. This isn't just an open world fps game, it also involves old school arcade style racing, something that reminded me of some of the classics I palyed back when I was small. This game might not have tonnes of guns but holy ♥♥♥♥!! it has tonnes of different bullets!! (Yup! you heard me......Bullets!!). Each enemy type requires you to switch ammunition type. Heavy bullets for heavily armored, insanely heavy bullets for insanely armored. This requires you to plan ahead before infiltrating a bandit camp, stocking up on ammo, best suited for that faction and resources. The game has a good variety and amount of enemy types that it will throw at you to keep things interesting. Weapons are awesome and every enemy reacts differently to different weapon, shoot their legs and they'll stumble and fall or shoot their faces and they'll try to reassure that their face isn't missing by touching it with their hands. The enemy ai is good, really good.\n\nThe game also has a decent crafting system which let's you craft items on the fly. You usewhatever parts scrap metal, junk you can salvage from the wasteland and dead bandits to create turrets, medkits, lock grinders, RC bbombs etc.\n\nTHE MULTIPLAYER\nSince I am playing the game 4 years after it's release, I couldn't find any matches online,\nSorry!!\n\nCons\nRage creates an illusion of being an open world I say this because at first it will tempt you by showcasing these sewers that are scattered all around the wasteland, the bandits carrying on with their work, doing their business but then it hits the speed breaker. When you finally get to explore these things you realize that their aren't that many sewers in the whole god damn game, and one of them unlocks only for one mission. The game will have you infiltrating the same camps again and again and again and again........ and for some f***ing reason you encounter enemies exactly at the same location you encountered them before, so even before you can see them you can fire a rocket straight to the location you had your last encounter and it will work. The world is big and filled with detail but there is not much to it, it all ultimately feels so dull because it lacks the depth feels too much abandoned, there's not a whole lot of things to do in it and it always holds your hand, restricting you from exploring it. Some of the locations which look interesting are locked out even though you could see the enemies shooting at you from a distance. I mean to say why give the players access to a place, which isn't ready to be discovered for another 2 to 3 hrs, so early. The sidequest are probably the weakest part of the game, the game itself is like stuck on a replay button, you do things which you have already done over and over again until you say "f*** this....I'm out". The end mission also feels a ♥♥♥♥♥slap to the players face, because the ending does not liveup to the hype that was earlier built throughout the campaign, the excitement to see the fate of the world, the future of your protagonist, what happend to your buddies etc, it's just so out of place and will leave you scratching your head. The NPCs look interesting (but are not) and have fluid animations but they don't have much to contribute towards your immersion and the world itself. This makes me feel so bad, this game feels like a wasted opportunity at the least, it certainly had tonnes of potentiol to become the next fallout people were hoping for.\n\n<SPOILER WARNING>\nand don't even let me remind you how pathetic and cheap the end mission is, when you are finally ready to rumble in rages final round, you hear your companions warn you, saying things like, "no one knows whats in there" or things like "whatever they are hiding in that facility must be big" hearing all this got me pumped up, and since they gave me a big f***ing gun to handle with the mess, I started to believe that an epic boss battle awaited me. I stocked up on all my resources, built every sentry turret I could afford and then the big moment came but guess what!! you get to fight chimpanzees, yup! you heard me mother f***ers!! you fight chimps (mutated ofcourse, if that was the plot twist you were looking for)......"they litterally give you a futuristic big f***ing plasma gun to kill chimps", WTF!\n\nVERDICT\n\n7.8/10\nSorry! but I just can't give it an 8, even though 7.8 pretty much means the same,\nIn the end, I would just say go ahead and buy it. It is a fun shooter, which will really hook you to it self, as combat is certainly the one part of the game, where Rage shines. Just don' t expect much given that it is an open world game published by none other than "Bethesda".","April 15, 2015","true","35.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It's kind of shooter I was looking for since the original DOOM and Duke Nukem 3D. Relatively short shooting sections go after even shorter story scenes with questing and a bit of a post apocalyptic world exlploration. And the game benefits from that approach. Most redundant features were cut off. Guns look amazing, sound beautiful and interact with enemies and environment so well that after a few minutes I found myself switching weapons only to look at how another goon would die from my beloved 45 caliber compared to the shotgun. It's fun, it's oldschool and it's that rare sort of John Carmack-style games that he doesn't make anymore. So this game is definitely worth checking out.","July 28, 2015","true","10.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The post-apocalyptic environment is immersive as well and looting enemies and their bases is fun.\n\nIt's not perfect - the "open world" feels limited at times and the graphics can look a bit bland. Also the driving sections feel a bit tedious when you just want to get into the shooting action! But hey these things aren't a big deal.\n\nThe co-op seems pretty cool as well.

You could, and should have been so much more.. First of all: the gun play in Rage is rock solid. ID knows how to make shooting fools in the face satisfying. But, and there is a huge but; the story is so badly put togheter and full of plot holes that by the end of the game i was really scratching my head at the fact that this was put togheter by a professional writer. The main plot really feels like it was cut short and the few subplots is just dead ends and is hardly worth you`re time. Then there is the mini games.. Personally i rarely engage in mini games unless there is some kind of story exposition to be had. Rage has so many pointless mini games that gives you absolutely nothing. They really feel like some slapped on filling since the "side quest" part of the game is a joke.\n\nThe game also suffers greatly from constant "pop-in" that can be really annoying if you are sensitive to that kind of graphical glitches.\nAll in all i was very disapointed.","March 24, 2014","false","28.2"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","1"

On one hand, there is one main (and important aspect) to the game that the game nails in spades (imo). However, on every other hand the game fails to deliver with…just about everything else. For me: The most important aspect to a videogame is that of its gameplay. With that in my mind on games, RAGE, to me, is the biggest counterexample to that claim that I have ever seen and played.\n\nThe basic premise is an asteroid fell to Earth and ravaged the planet creating the homeland and setting to the main game, the Wasteland. You play as an Ark survivor who awakens to find the rest of your Ark members dead. Afterwards, you activate a panel that opens the door and step out into the desolate world. You enter the Wasteland and encounter some of the enemies that you will be fighting later on your journey and after being saved by Dan Hagar (played by John Goodman). You and him set off for town to begin your adventure and help in the ongoing battle against the bandits who rule the Wasteland.\n\nRight off the bat, story wise, you can tell this isn't going to be any more than just a slapped on, Grade B, generic story that's sole purpose is a background for you and your rampant annihilation that you bring onto the enemies of the Wasteland. To be fair, id isn't really a company well known for their story telling, characters, or even their open worlds like say the Fallout series. However, in RAGE it feels like id was putting more emphasis on story and characters than their previous works; it felt as if id really wanted to break free from their simplistic shooter roots of just running and gunning with barely and reasoning behind except, "Screw it! Why not?" That and the modern warfare market the FPS genre lives in now makes it difficult for future FPS games to not include it in the main game. Either way, the singleplayer portion of RAGE story wise is painfully average at best with characters that are barely memorable or interesting; they leave absolutely no impression on you and are there solely to have you help them in the form of missions. Missions in the game aren't really good either, they're your standard RPG-esque affair of, "Clear out X area." Just like about everything else in the game, missions are typical, offer no variety, and ontop of everything else is uninteresting and stock; it makes for one very average package. Voice acting is decent, some voices sound rather strange for the setting they're in and some voices don't feel right with their character design but otherwise the voice acting isn't too terrible, but, with such stock and uninteresting characters it hardly matters. Again, this wouldn't be too much of a big deal given id's previous works but considering how much more emphasis id has put on the world and the characters this time around it's a shame that this is the end result.\n\nThe big surprise for me, though, was in the graphics. Graphically, RAGE is stunning; the textures are crisp, the detail is insane, and the models on characters are incredibly well done as well as their animations. Id's new Tech 5 engine is quite a looker and is better than most of the other engines FPSs and games in general are running on these days. What really stuns me is just how well the graphics worked for my PC; I'm not well versed in PC terminology and graphic fidelity but here's what I will say: I can barely play Skyrim on high without my computer struggling to run 15 FPS let alone 30; RAGE, however, was buttery smooth throughout my whole time playing it. The game didn't lag for me, I didn't need to downgrade the graphics, and, besides a few graphical issues here and there, looked absolutely amazing and ran impeccably well given my machine.\n\nGraphically, RAGE looks incredible but visually, it's very unappealing; that does more or less have to do with the setting at hand rather than the art department’s fault plus I’m not a fan visually of post-apocalyptic settings. Even if I was I feel RAGE would still disappoint me on that ground; it lacks any personality and doesn't stand out from the rest. It has no defining characteristics and is just as stock and generic as the characters that inhabit the world. Yes, it is a post-apocalyptic setting so it's rather hard for the game to have "personality" but, come on. You can't say that no games set in the post-apocalyptic future setting don’t have personality. Again, going back to the Fallout series, some of the games have personality to them and are much more interesting than anything and anybody in RAGE. Graphics are great on RAGE and look great on my PC, it's just that the graphics that make up the world are uninteresting and lack any real defining characteristic that sets it apart from the rest.\n\nAs stated previously, the biggest aspect that this game and id knock out of the ballpark is the gameplay (well, half of it at least). Keep in mind, I have not played a previous id title before RAGE; I have seen footage of their other work but I have never really played any of their other games so I have no previous knowledge on how well their previous FPS mechanic offerings have been. I can say, though, that between all my other FPS games that I've played previously, RAGE might just be the best that I've played in that aspect. Every gun feels excellent and meaty to use, gunning down enemies is a blast, and besides one gun (shotgun wasn't really as good as I was hoping it would be) all the guns sound great to fire; though, in my time with the game there were barely any guns outside of the pistol, shotgun, assault and sniper rifle, and rocket launcher. RAGE isn't as fast paced as Doom or Quake so there is a little bit of weight and slowness to your character but even with that restriction the FPS mechanics in RAGE are some of the best I've seen since the original Crysis.\n\nOn top of the excellent FPS mechanics, RAGE also offers racing and car combat gameplay. Driving mechanics, for the most part, aren't to terrible; there were some weird moments like whenever I made a reversal U-Turn so that I could go back and destroy the bandit's buggies I turn a little faster than when I'm turning normally so instead of a 180 degree turn around it was like a slight 270 degree instead. It was weird and frustrating but for the most part the driving is pretty solid in the game; it's just not as good as the FPS mechanics and is really only used as a means of travel. Car combat I found, mechanically speaking, OK but personally for me I just found it rather boring more than anything else. Also should mention that I have not played a single second of the multiplayer as, from what I've heard, the multiplayer focuses more on the driving and car combat aspect. I also didn't play any co-op because, I had no idea co-op was even apart of RAGE. Though, honestly, co-op is co-op, it's practically a given at this point that with friends co-op can be an absolute blast especially if co-op focuses more on the FPS part of RAGE than the multiplayer did.\n\nOverall, RAGE is a difficult game for me to like. It nails the FPS gameplay and the graphics are great but everything else in the package ranges from decent to below average. There's barely any creativity to the game, you don't care for anything or anybody in the game, strange design choices, while OK not a fan of the driving or car combat, and because of the emphasis on story and characters the game pulls you out of the gameplay more so than it should. RAGE is not a bad game, but it is a very weak game given the id's broad history. Keep in mind I only played it for 12 hours if even that, maybe later the game picks up the pace but from what I played these are the feelings I am left with. If you can focus more on the meaty and excellent FPS mechanics more so than I could then you'll probably find RAGE a more enjoyable game. If not then there's not much else that the game really has going for it so my advice: skip it.","December 17, 2013","false","12.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/recommended/9200/","Foxysen","Foxysen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/","1172 products in account","RAGE is a mix of FPS and Driving genres, set in post-apocalyptic desert setting and with some dose of RPG elements, this comes in form of inventory and hub world. Yep, still developed by id Software, who mostly were doing FPS games, and released in 2011, published by Bethesda by that time. It runs on id Tech 5, main point of which were mega-textures.\n\nThere were few versions of RAGE. If you pre-ordered then you would recieve Anarchy Edition. You can also buy it separately but no on Steam. Anarchy included few unique items to make players more powerful, including Double Shotgun. From what I understand some of Anarchy editions came with code for Sewers DLC. You could also buy this DLC separately on consoles. There are also some comics and "making of" videos, Collector Edition came with those. And then there was Campaign Edition for Mac OS X that included Anarchy Edition content plus Sewer DLC, but was singleplayer-only.\nWhile Steam version is not Anarchy Edition, it comes with Sewers DLC for free. And that's good, because this DLC gives sewers levels that are filled with mutants which can challenge you only in the very beggining. Not something worth after beating game.\nAs far as I know the only good difference between consoles and PC is that consoles support split-screen for multiplayer.\n\nThe thing is that this game apparently was hyped as being really open-world RPG, but in the end people got hub of corridors between each traditional level, making people dissapointed. And because id is a brand and people expect revolution, even though id only did it with Doom1/Quake1 long time ago. And since people want everything post-apocalyptic game to be either Fallout or Borderlands, well, it got underrated.\n\nTechnically, it had a lot of problems at the launch. John Carmack came up with new feature called Mega-Textures. You may think of it as super-detailed textures, but what it means is that artists can can place something nice in one spot without it looping all over the wall. He must have been expected that hardware people would be the one who would rush to give proper support for that feature, but RAGE wasn't Quake 1 and no one cared. And so majority of players experienced huge issues with textures pop-in, where everything will take seconds to become clear when you look at it. Thankfully, game was patched around and hardware moved ever since, so it should be fine now.\nAt least it shows that programming fancyness of John Carmack is better at developing cutting edge VR tech than games, where "can most average players hardware run it" is more important.\n\nIt also has a multiplayer component. Which is being run by lobby system. And community of which is quite dead.\nIt has two modes. No, not Deathmatch and Capture The Flag.\nThe first mode is Road Rage, which is competetive and uses Racing genre of a game. Has a few sub-modes and is designed for 4 players. Didn't get to play it. Just check YouTube for gameplay.\nSecond mode is Wasteland Legends - cooperative FPS. It's designed for 2 players and seems to use unique short missions. Or you could play them in singleplayer, alone. Well, not all that unique, it uses assets from single-player, but it's not same layouts. Plotwise they tell stories of behind-the-scene events, something silly like "how Dan got Sniper Rifle". There are no inventories, few weapons, you occasionally come across supply which will max out your ammo, if you run out of defib then your friend will have to come and revive you. Not much value for singles, better drag a friend into it.\n\nAnd yes, as many people will tell you, plot isn't good. For RPG. If forget that this is mainly linear FPS/Racing game. So it does job fine. Then again, seeing the hype it was dissapointed. But don't worry, setting combined with amazing graphics are still fun. Seeing all the new amazing NPC designs and hearing the way that each enemy clan communicates with each other, as well as finding out in what enviroment they live, is what was the driving force for me. Game also has great atmoshpere. It goes from surviving wasteland, to more of feeling of just well-stocked desert and then ends with more of techy and resistance feel.\nThe bad thing is ending. If you played enough id games then you will be smart not to expect epilogues. And then many games have some "you are awsome" ending, teaching players to appericate journey, not the ending. But then this time they forgot to put final boss or any climax battle in. You just got this cool gun that can shoot BFG rounds and you just derp through weak enemies. Still, not a huge flaw.\n\nAs for gameplay, it's a classic id shooter. Well, in modern linear level design, where you have one path and any other path is usually filled with knee-tall trash that you can't get over. But the shooting and action itself is great fun. Do people still consider having 9 weapons at same time as old-school?\nWeapons can use different kidn of ammo types. Like shocking water with elector-bolts. Or beating the hell out of heavy armor guys by loading your pistol with Fat Mammas.\nAnd you have a few items you can use, most notably explosive RC cars, placing turrets and using wingstick. Wingsticks is a boomerang that homes at enemy, is strong and can even return succesfully. It's Rage's title weapon, so to say. Shame that whether it breaks or returns seem to be based around randomness than skill.\n\nAnimations of enemies makes it feel like proper FPS too and not some RPG, with them getting wounded while running, falling onto ground and shooting at you from there. It's mostly hitscan-abuse type of game, but at least regenerating health keeps it sane. And defib, where you can still revive after death. Most common enemies are melee ones that rush you straight or ranged ones that hide behind cover. What is great is that later they take more hits than your average modern FPS cannon fodder and can maneuver around, while giving a look of intellegent enemies by communicating, making it dynamic. It also helps that each clan is a bit unique, like Shadow clan has bandits that are more acrobatic.\nI once got sneakily killed from shotgun from behind, so it's cool.\n\nRacing/Driving part takes a secondary place sadly. It delivers finely, in that you can drive between missions in a hub world or do a racing. Boosting, minigun and rocket-launching and all that. It has arcade physics and feel to it, aside from having to purchase ammo. But it doesn't have much aside from shooting rockets at enemy. And racing events don't have many tracks and don't seem to be too crazy, they just kinda get repetetive after a while. It still a good part with explosions and ramming, just not deep. If they had some physics rampage and destroyable objects, then at least it could be as "aw yeah" as Flatout games.\n\nYou also get some open-world stuff that are very few towns. Where you can grab some quests of racing. Or play some not interesting mini-games. Cards one is kinda cool. Or you can take a job quest, which is mostly redoing the beaten levels. Still cool lively locations, but don't put focus on them. Don't forget to purchase some ammo and ingridients. Game has too many ammo for few weapons to be survival, but very few for stuff like Sniper Rifle. Oh, and you can craft. This game also gives a bit of survival feel by making you scavenge, picking various trash in missions to sell it later.\n\nMain issue with it is that it doesn't manage to mix FPS and Driving well. Those are kept separately. Hub and races for cars, missions and towns for on-foot. Which may be good, as FPS people have to beat only 2 mandatory races. But still, could make it more interesting this way.\n\nOh, and music provides background for action and varied but nothing to remember. And there were like, two bosses.\n\nBut overall, if you come here for your linear id Software FPS with a bit of racing and not some Fallout or Borderlands, then you will have fun there. Hub world with linear missions are still good games.","November 4, 2015","true","36.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","1"

Unfortunately a lack of marketing combined with the overall lack of content are what ultimately made this game less successfull than its 2011 classmates such as Skyrim. With that said, to this day this is easily one of my favorite games that I have played. What the game lacks in content is makes up for a million times in character, beauty and overall fluid gameplay.\n\nIn comparison, RAGE vs. Bioshock (any of them) Rage wins in actual gameplay and mechanics while Bioshock would win with the strong storyline. They are  both incredible games, but put the stoy-type that Bioshock has into this game and honestly you have the perfect FPS game.\n\nI'll start with Cons:\n-The game is short, there is no way around it.\n-There is more more that they could have done with the 'racing' aspect of this game. It really is more of a mini game within the game but it offered versatility in a fairly constricting game.\n-This is a FPS with linear story progression, there is very minimal sandbox-type capabilities\n\nThe Pros:\n-Gameplay is just delightful\n-Weapons are varied and the bow with environment interavtivity and ammunition types is just increible.\n-The various ways to approach every single fight whether it is through exploding remote cars, guns blazing, etc... The game boasts strong versatility in gameplay.\n-TONS of mini-games within the game that are all pretty fun.\n-The story is very entertaining\n-The game is full of vibrant characters and monsters\n-The art style is great\n-The graphics are just beautiful considering a 2011 release date.\n-The engine was truely a pioneer, boasting ZERO, I repeat, NO replicated areas or terrain types. (To explain, in most games, areas are replicated, reconfigured and reskinned. For example, in Fallout you may notice that a lot of areas are quite similar. This does not happen in RAGE as the engine was developed to be able to specifically alter each area, each rock, each spray painted wall.)\n","May 4","true","38.8"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","0"

An average player will probably spend about 15-20 hours on the base game and 30 tops on the whole package.\n\n++PROS++\n+ World design, characters design, weapons design, everything is original and great looking\n+ Engaging firefights in extremly varied locations where tactics count and cover is important(!)\n+ An AI that lives up to its name, from mutants running on the ceiling to soldiers throwing grenades to get you out of cover\n+ Original weapons like razor-boomerangs (that do return!) or RC bomb cars\n+ An ingame trading card game where you have to find/buy/kill for cards you use to construct decks which you play against NPCs for cash\n+ Car races&fights that are just complex enough to be fun but simple enough to enjoy even playing with mouse/kb\n+ A crafting system that has you hunt for scraps and recipes to craftt everything from ammo to small robots.\n+ Conversations are mostly voice acted and human(oid) enemies do a lot of trash talk during fights. VO quality is good and even the music is mostly enjoyable.\n\n--CONS--\n- Too less of everything. Places, npcs, quests, weapons, vehicles....had the game triple it's size, it could have become a contender for FO\n- Not exactly railroaded but far from open world, regions have to be unlocked and the longer the game goes the more often you drive along the same routes over and over again\n- The story starts out very good but somewhere in the last quarter it looses grip and logic and the "end" feels rushed and unfinished\n- Some boss fights can hardly be won by intuition, you will have to google the tactics once or twice\n- An autosave system you will have to get used to (it's not unfair though)\n\nIf you decide to give RAGE a try, get the DLCs from the start - imo the're not much fun to play after the base game's end.","December 17, 2015","true","45.5"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","6","9","0","0"

It's interesting, well written and it's got good dialouge. Just don't expect Metal Gear levels of depth and you'll be fine.\nGameplay-wise it's also on the good side, with varying locations and enemy types as well as good boss battles. Don't go in expecting this to be fallout though, as much as it is "open world", the world is fairly small with not a lot to do in it, compared to other open world games.\nThe AI is servicable if predictable, they will however react to getting shot in different ways depending on where you shoot them (yes, that includes groin-shots). Overall, pretty good again. This game also has a fairly big focus on verhicles and racing aswell as vehicular combat.\nWhat kills it for me is the port. The mouse acceleration and -smoothing is oh so very strong with this one, and you need to dig in the config files to get rid of it. And trust me, just setting mouse sensetivity to zero doesn't help. The performance is equally bad. Even on my GTX 760 I can't play this game on any higher than medium setting without having the framerate go lower than 30. And the texture pop-in is massive, it can take take multiple seconds to load texture if you turn.\n\nConclusion: I'd recommend this game for anyone who was gonna use a controller anyways or is willing to fix stuff themselves. I've had my fun with it (~20 to get through with the campaign and some of the sidestuff) and don't regret the purchase.","October 16, 2014","true","28.2"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/badtexture/recommended/9200/","badtexture","Kill-Cam Celebrity","http://steamcommunity.com/id/badtexture/","184 products in account","It would be a competent but forgettable shooter, but as much as I wanted to like RAGE, the id Tech 5 engine is atrocious.  Wolfenstein had many of these problems, but MachineGames did their best to utilize its strengths and cover its weaknesses.  Here, we get to see just how terrible the engine really is.\n\nAs far as the game itself goes, it's your generic old-school/new-school mash-up game.  The gunplay is still satisfying, as you'd damn well expect from id, but there's just some clunkiness to it I can't put my finger on.  I suspect this also has to do with the engine, as when it isn't microstuttering and streaming 128x128 textures two feet away from me, I start enjoying it again.  I'm not even a graphics snob either, and it still gets to me with just how jarring and distracting the pop-in problems are.\n\nThe game puts you in a post-apocalyptic world, where bandits are everywhere and you go around doing quests for different people.  You can also get some vehicles along the way, and carry four weapons at a time.  Sound familiar?  Correct, this game hits pretty close to Borderlands in its gameplay.  Sadly, Borderlands takes what it does and does it well, while RAGE focuses more on its slightly-decent gunplay, so it's more of a "Borderline" than anything.\n\nLet me go out and say, I f@#king hate the car physics.  They're just awful.  You've got turbo and a single handbrake that's way too efficient.  Your car is pretty much glued to the floor, the smallest pebble can stop your car altogether, and moving fast with boost only exaggerates the problems I stated before with pop-in.  I dread any and all cars in this game.\n\nOn an Nvidia card, the game will be slightly more playable with GPU Transcode as a feature.  However, since they cashed out to Nvidia and decided AMD users (even with their own CUDA, "Stream") weren't worthy of a playable game, fellow AMD owners should avoid this steaming pile of sellout ♥♥♥♥ like the plague.  Even if you own an Nvidia card, the unoriginal story and only-decent gunplay still isn't worth full price.  id, I'm seriously disappointed.  How such a legendary studio could come up with an end result like this is honestly pathetic.  I'm sorry to say this, but RAGE is my first victim of the almighty Steam Refund.\n\nAlso, a little texture compression would be nice.  If you're not even going to have these full textures appear in-game half the time, why do they need to take up 30GB I could be using for games with actual effort put into them?","December 23, 2015","false","1.0"," 11 of 19 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","11","19","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jocosity/recommended/9200/","jocosity","Communist "Joseph Ballin" Layton","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jocosity/","920 products in account","===Note: The Steam Review Police are trying to keep me down and limit my text, so like half of this review is in the comments===\n4 years ago, I purchased RAGE. It was $30, and this was back when a game dropping to $30 within the year of its release was a deal of a lifetime and not an everyday occurrence on GMG, so I thought it was a great deal. I had heard the horror stories of its launch regarding things like ATI and general pop-in issues, but I figured enough time had passed that those bugs had been worked out. And they had, for the most part, but that wasn't why RAGE became one of my most regretted purchases on Steam. But instead of reviewing the game as I remember it, I decided to replay it just to articulate everything that I found wrong with RAGE.\n\nFirst off, if you have two or more monitors and your primary isn't on the left, RAGE is going to default to try launching on your left monitor. It doesn't matter how big or small it is, or if it's set as your primary monitor (which is what most sensible games launch to); it's going to make it fit until you get in and tell it not to. The engine is also locked at 60 FPS, so if you're like me and have a nice 144 hz monitor and want to get the most of it then you should go somewhere else. But enough technical nitpicking - what about the game?\n\nWell first off, I should mention the graphics, because it's obligatory that whenever someone mentions RAGE they have to talk about the graphics because that's the only memorable thing in this game. I could sit here and laugh at how bad the texture pop-in is, or how low resolution the textures are for hours, but I actually can't because I hit the text limit that I didn't know steam reviews had, so instead I'm just going to just leave you these videos I recorded throughout the last few days, and screenshots to accompany them, so you can laugh at them yourself. Just let me know when you're done so I can continue - they're compressed to 720p, but they still demonstrate the effects enough. These are all recorded and screenshotted on a GTX 970 with an i5 3570k overclocked to 4.4 GHz.\n\nhttp://puu.sh/jvyNH/9ed9b1eb9f.mp4\nhttp://puu.sh/jvOqm/6589f38244.mp4\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=497666089\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=497666199\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=499374619\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=499374777\nhttp://imgur.com/a/Qmc3x\n\nSee, the thing about RAGE's graphics is that they look great when you're outside, but the game's interiors pretty much universally look like garbage from a game from 2004. Of particular note is that the game has no dynamic lighting that I could see, so instead of giving you a flashlight or something they just made all the darkness the color green, which just makes it look even uglier. Thankfully, this also has the unexpected side effect of making the pop-in not very noticeable, because even if the textures haven't popped in at all you won't be able to tell if it's using placeholders or if that's just how the game looks. What you will notice, however, is how barren the world feels. The items that can be picked up have a noticeable contrast in texture quality with the rest of the world, and since RAGE is a game where you're expected to search every nook and cranny to find said objects, there's no excuse for said nooks and crannies to look so completely awful. Nothing else in any given level can generally be interacted with - you can't break bottles, you can't push chairs, you get the idea; it feels like the entire map is just one big model that you're moving through, and combined with the total lack of any dynamic lighting it makes the interior environments feel extremely dull.\n\nOh, but what's that you say? You want to know about the wasteland itself? The one you've seen so many beautiful scenic screenshots about? Well, the problem is that those are just that - they're scenic wastelands that you drive through, take a screenshot of, and drive past. And that's a good thing, because even if you're outside and you get too close to a rock, or look down, the graphics just don't hold up. Now, regarding the pop-in demonstrated above there is a config that you can put in your launch options to remove it (supposedly, that is - I didn't try it, since I wanted the "full RAGE experience"). The catch? It requires a GPU with at least 3 GB of VRAM. For a game in 2011, this is unacceptable. For a game that looks like it was made in 2004, this is laughable. But with all that, the graphics aren't even the real flaw of RAGE.\n\nAs I said before, the interiors of the game are generally extremely ugly and bland. But while you might think that doesn't matter because of how much you've heard about the wasteland, the fact is that about 80% of the game takes place in those ugly interiors. For all you've heard about the wasteland overworld, it's essentially one big kodak moment, made for you to take a screenshot of on your way to the next interior. The wasteland is essentially just a big race track from one place to another, and you'll notice that feeling if you decide to play it. RAGE, despite its appearance, is an extremely linear game. Every  area in the game is either blocked off or locked until it's time to go there in a story mission, and half the time once you finish in said area, it locks off again, meaning there's plenty of missable content to be had because that's what gamers want in modern games. They don't even do a particularly good job of blocking the areas off - sometimes paths are just obstructed by almost waist-high blockades that you just can't jump over. Like these.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=497667786\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=497667076\n\nFurthering the linearity is that you aren't allowed to pick up weapons from the ground until you're at the point where you're "supposed" to obtain a particular weapon, even if it's a weapon that you do find later on. I can understand why we can't pick up a fallen enemy's assault rifle which is visually different from any of the ones you obtain. I can't understand why I can't pick up this shotgun, which was lying beside the person I killed.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=497668166\n\nExcept while I don't understand it, I do know exactly why I couldn't pick it up - it was because that person was in the area where I was doing a side quest that was all but forced into my hands. The reward for the quest in question was a combat shotgun - not that exact combat shotgun, but the same combat shotgun, except it was blessed with the almighty quest reward status. That's the extent of the linearity of this game.\n\nSo what about the actual levels, then? What are they like? Well, for the most part they're pretty much just the winding linear corridors you would expect from a standard-fare FPS. There are little bits and bobs that you can pick up to craft doodads and then immediately forget about, and every now and then there will be a neat secret that references Wolfenstein or Quake or something else to remind you that you could be playing a game where you can actually have fun right now. Each level involves running to the other end, grabbing the thing that the person who gave you the quest wanted you to grab, and then leaving through the new convenient exit that wasn't accessible from the beginning. Then if you're feeling really dangerous, you can go to the "sidequest board" and get a "sidequest", which basically involves going back through that exit, going back through the same level backwards, and grabbing another thing for some other person. One or two of the "sidequests" are particularly risky and try to break the mold and put you in a little cage and have you snipe mutants while defending a bunch of idiots.\n\n===CONTINUED IN THE COMMENTS===","August 14, 2015","false","50.5"," 32 of 60 people (53%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","53","32","60","7","15"

The distinct plot in Rage actually begins and comes to an end with an introductory roller. The asteroid Apofis slowly flies by through external limits of Solar system, punches a huge hole in one of rings of Saturn, at all takes down a half of the Moon and under sad music falls to the Ground. There for the guest already wait — participants of the special Ark project plunge into hibernation in underground shelters to wake up in many years and to restore the destroyed civilization. You — one of the volunteers chosen for burial, and your ark after more than hundred years of expectation at last wakes up and at the same time awakes you. All other inhabitants of a shelter were lost as a result of refusal of life support systems, behind a window — the desert filled in with the sun. Welcome to the wonderful new world. Everything that occurs after that, only creates visibility of advance. To you don't explain with sense that occurs around, don't help to get used to the new world, don't represent the villain who wants to be destroyed immediately and without trace. NPC constantly give different tasks, but each new mission is desperately similar on previous, and all of them as a whole are necessary only in order that you had a formal occasion to go to the next cellar and to pull a metaphorical eye on a metaphorical ♥♥♥ to the next company of mutants. No real subject movement in Rage happens. The same history — from an automobile component of game which developers too very much advertized. In reality cars are necessary to move first of all between not numerous settlements and kvestovy locations. In the second — for participation in boring races, whose only mission — to allow you to lift enough means to buy new wheels or to decorate the car with skulls. Fortunately, it is not all that is in Rage. It at all the most important. Because the main events of game are developed in catacombs and mines, underground dens and laboratories. To put it briefly, in an action part. And here is how a pure shooter of Rage — one of the most fascinating and worthy games this year.

"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198050154712/recommended/9200/","76561198050154712","Srgt. Futtbucker","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198050154712/","88 products in account","This is a must-play for any shooter fans tired of Call of Duty rip-offs and unimaginative zombie games that plague the market.\n\nRage takes a format of shooter I never knew I wanted and brings it into the light: fast-paced, frantic, edge-of-your-seat, run-and-gun chaos.  The best and most memorable moments include walking through a creepy corridor before being ambushed by bandits (essentially Rage's zombies) wielding knives, fighting a mutant boss while sprinting around and making use of the last of your weapon's ammo, or picking off bandits from a distance with a perfect headshot from your sniper or silent crossbow.  I could go on.  This is a game that, when at its best, relentlessly aims to leave you on the edge of your seat.  If you want the comfort of cover or friendly A.I.'s by your side, or like casual shooters that you can unwind and relax with, RAGE is not for you.  For everyone else, keep reading.\n\nBesides the frantic action, the game succeeds in equipping the player with awesome weapons and providing enemy A.I. that actually pose a threat.  Nothing ruins a shooter more than a bland array of generic assault rifles and pistols.  Rage provides the player with numerous guns all available at the tap of a button and every single one is fun to use.  The standout of them all isn't a gun at all, but rather a letal and silent boomerang called the Wingstick.  It specializes in decapitating bandits at the press of a button and was by far my favorite weapon in the game.  Every other gun performs remarkably too, leaving the player with a number of options to tackle a threat.  Will you take out that bandit from a distance with a crossbow headshot?  Maybe you'll run and gun with your hip-fired shotgun.  Or why not drive a C4-strapped RC car into a few bandits and blow them to bits?  The options are nearly limitless and always entertaining, leaving a satisfying feeling every time I achieved a creative kill.\n\nThankfully, the remarkable enemy A.I. prevents you from becoming too OP.  I was repeatedly stunned by how seamlessly the A.I. would find the most direct route to eliminate the threat (a.k.a. you).  Think that low wall in front of you will deter a bandit?  Prepare for him to scale it without a second thought.  Missed a headshot with your crossbow bolt aimed at a bandit 50 feet away?  Get ready to frantically pop off shots as he jumps from platform to platform and weaves in-and-out of obstacles in an effort to slice you to pieces.  The occassional bosses and mini-bosses also put your twitch reflexes to the test.  This is a game that puts your aim and reflexes to the test.\n\nThe frantic gunplay is where Rage truly shines.  Unfortunately, Id Software tried to change up the formula with driving/racing diversions and "open world" elements that ultimately fail to deliver.  I say "open world" because the game is really rather linear.  The only real exploration you'll do is on your brief, 5-minute drive to your next location.  As I mentioned earlier, the tight corridors and frantic, edge-of-your-seat gunplay are where Rage stands out from modern shooters.  Id's decision to tack on generic open world elements is not only surprising, but also takes away from what makes Rage unique and entertaining.  You are encouraged throughout the game to battle enemy vehicles with your vehicle-mounted minigun/rocket-launcher combo and compete in races.  While the on-foot A.I. are challenging, the driving A.I. never pose much of a threat.  The game encourages you to spend money on vehicle upgrades, but the enemy vehicles are so easy and the "open world" is so small and lackluster that I never bought any car upgrades beyond what I was required to to progress.\n\nUsually an engaging story and entertaining missions can save a boring open world and crappy driving gameplay.  But the story and missions are easily Rage's worst features.  The game opens with an epic scene of a spaceship crashing onto a planet.  The player steps out of the reckage to witness a beautifully rendered, post-apocalyptic wasteland and through a series of conversations essentially finds out he is the chosen one from a distant past.  Beyond that, I had absolutely no idea what was happening in the story.  For some reason, my character was special and the enemies wanted me dead.  The narrative was so poorly explained and random that I can't imagine anyone playing the game to actually follow along.  Unfortunately, the missions aren't much better.  Prepare for fetch quests galore that you perform for no real reason.  The main storyline is essentially ditched in favor of short tasks that involve getting upgrades to ultimately defeat...something?  I was never sure who the main enemy was or what I was working towards in the game.\n\nThankfully, I didn't really care.  The gunplay was so fun that I was eager to help gather some generic supplies for Mr. Cartoonish Mayor, just to decapitate a few more bandits.  The driving segments are short enough to never be game-breakingly annoying.  And the enemies were engaging enough to never stop me from sitting on the edge of my seat, anxiously anticipating the next bandit to sprint at me with a knife.  The odd steampunk setting mixed with a generic post-apocalyptic wasteland didn't do much for selling me on the narrative or goofy characters.  But ultimately it didn't matter, as Rage is a stellar game that every shooter fan should play.","July 4, 2014","true","8.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

While more linear and strightfoward than fallout, it resembles the characteristiscs of Borderlands.  The character devleopment and interaction fall more along the lines of fallout, so you do get the best of both worlds.  While maybe not as good as it's solo counterparts, this game is a nice break from the time one needs to put in when playing an open world video game, sometimes you want the post apocalyptic feel but able to play it at a quicker pace.  Weapon selection is alright, and nothing is more fun that shooting rebar out of your nail gun at a enemy.  Customization and crafting (for once) Is a pretty big must in this game as money is avaiable but tends to run out quickly since good ammunition is in short supply and must often be bought or crafted.\n\nOverall I would rate this a solid 8/10.  Good atmosphere, character interaction, and fast paced sense of accomplishment make this game a +.  The negatives are the low ammount of character customization, combat interaction could be improved, and storyline worked on.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cyper064/recommended/9200/","cyper064","Cyper","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cyper064/","336 products in account","Gaphical Fidelity: ID outdid themselved with the visuals of this game. The texture qualities themselves may not be astounding. But the vastness of the world and details of each individual component make it quite a breath-taking sight. For me, it is still one of the most visually appealing games i've played. The artstyle is damn impressive.\n\nPerformance: As much as i'd like to say all good things about this game. The texture popping is something that was an issue on release, and still has not been properly patched till this day. It's not a major issue, and not too noticeable on my computer rig, but it doesn't exactly make ID look like they put a lot of time into fixing the game.\n\nDesign: I love the character and map design. Each enemy type has so many different variations, it doesn't feel too repetetive when fighting them. Plus the characters you talk to are each unique and memorable in their own way, wether it be serious and rought around the edges, or kind of goofy.\n\nRPG Aspects: This is something that kind of looks like it was shoved in last second. Don't get me wrong, it works, but it feels unfinished. You don't have any stats you can mess around with for your character. The clothing you wear is picked out of 3 different variations near the beginning of the game, meaning not a lot of variety. There are basic upgrades for armour, and for your individual weapons, but they are very basic. The coolest part would probably be the item crafting. Even though it is quite simple. It makes you go looking for the unique parts required to make certain items, such as the explosive RC cars, lock drills, bandages, etc.\n\nStory: Honestly, story could have been better. It sets the tone quite early on and I quite liked how it began, but without spoiling anything, the ending was a bummer and quite of left you hanging. Plus, you can't continue playing after the campaign to explore which I thought was silly. The ending really allowed for it...\n\nVoice Acting: Voice acting was fantastic, I don't have any issues with it. Frankly they had me at John Goodman.\n\nAI: The enemies AI was frankly one of the best parts of the game. They aren't your typical baddies that just stand there or rush directly at you. They were far cleverer than I expected. I found that enemies with melee weapons would duck and weave to avoid your shots, plus jumping, rolling and climbing to make them quite adept at reaching you without being hit. Any with ranged weapons wouldn't just stand there, but use cover wisely. Retreat if you were bearing down hard on them, advance if they found they had an advantage. Not just that, sometimes they would work together; for instance, the Authority had units that defended with a energy shield, and other units would hide behind him for protection.\n\nWeapons: The weapon design was quite good, but what made the guns so much fun to use, is their sounds, kickback, and also the phsyics implemented when an enemy was downed. If you shot an enemy in the head, their helmet would fall off, shoot them in the leg, they'll limp or topple over. Hit them with a shotgun, they'd go barreling through the air. As a FPS, I absolutely approve, and found the shooting aspect solid.\n\n____________________\nPresentation: 7 (Clearly high production, but story was weak and not all the characters were that memorable)\nGraphics: 7.5 (I would of given this a higher rating if the texture popping issue was fixed)\nSound: 8.5 (Sound was overall impressive, especially on the weapons. Plus voice acting was above par most of the time)\nGameplay: 8 (Excellent shooting sequences, but I did find the car comabt kind of tedious)\nOverall: 8 (A large amount of content for Single player, but only about 7-8 hours for the campaign. Does include co-op missions and a car combat competetive mode which is nice)","March 23, 2014","true","14.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/superpeon81/recommended/9200/","superpeon81","[Samsquanch] Ricky","http://steamcommunity.com/id/superpeon81/","102 products in account","RAGE is one of those games that I love to hate. I frequently find myself wanting to punch my screen, and continue on at the same time.\n\nI started this game on Ultra Nightmare difficulty because I am somewhat of a masochist. I held my own after learning the mutants attack patterns, and figured I could progess slowly through the game using a decent plan of attack and ammo conservation. I quickly realized that not only would I never finish a Bash TV episode without a hypochondriac's collection of bandages, but I also could not win a race that involved a time clock. I spent the entirety of my UN attempt broke and without ammo in my guns and my car. I was basically reloading the same pathetic attempts to "luck out" without pulling my hair out of my scalp.\n\nAfter 20 plus hours of this anxiety attack inducing frustration I dialed it down to Nightmare and have been progressing at a steady rate. I am totally addicted to the game when it comes to fps combat and enemy commentary. I find myself giggling as much the last time I heard "Hey he killed what's-his-name!" as I did the first. I have found most of the weapons have a direct purpose at least once, and the art style is somewhat of a favorite of mine.\n\nThe downsides I have noticed as a current player of at least mediocre knowledge of the game would definitely include the racing controls and overall uselessness of most weapons in the game. I am not using a gamepad so maybe that contributes to my problem, but it seems like the more I upgrade my cars the worse they perform. Every situation I use the car in (combat races, open world, time trial, etc) the car seems to perform differently. I assume there is some form of scaling invovled in different scenarios, but I don't know if that's true. Either way it keeps me from grasping a familiarity with the vehicle I have invested in, and takes away from the overall level of enjoyment when it comes to racing. Once I have the story mode racing achievements finished I'll probably avoid it all together on future playthroughs.\n\nThe weapon selection is farily decent for a standard single player game of this kind. The problem for me is that even on Nightmare (and Ultra Nightmare for a short time) I find myself using four guns. Two of them for all average encounters and two of them for special ones. I used standard buckshot in the shotgun and steel tipped bolts in the crossbow in every fight I find myself in. Crossbow is for human combat, and the shotgun is for mutant combat. I never bother with anything else leaving most of my weapons forever ammo capped. In circumstances out of the norm I use the double barrel shotgun (Anarchy DLC ftw) armed with Pop Rockets, and the pistol armed with Fat Mamas or Killstrikes. The double barrel with Pop Rockets takes down any large scale boss or DLC related special mutants in seconds, and the pistol with said custom ammo destroys armored humans in a similar fashion after I shoot off their helmet using the crossbow. Perhaps my experience will change once I reach the end of the story and battle the Authority, but that has yet to be discovered. I find the automatic rifles to be ammo dumps that destroy my accuracy overall, and even with armor piercing rounds just feel totally underwhelming. The nailgun fits into that category as well, and I haven't used it since I finished the achievements related to it. I know its ammo is retrieveable (rebar only), but so are crossbow bolts that don't take 4 seconds to reload.\n\nThe crafting system is keeping me interested until I have all the schematics aquired. I mostly only use it for turrets (still trying to kill 5 enemies for the Steam achievement and will probably have to do this on normal difficulty) and lock grinders for obvious reasons. I only spend four more dollars on bandages if I just buy them compared to buying the pieces (Crimson Elite armor from Anarchy DLC ftw) and after earning $40,000 at the poker machine 4 bucks just isn't all that much compared to crafting time. So basically the best part of this system is crafting my pistol ammo. Kudos for putting a crafting system in, but 90 percent of the time I'll just skip it.\n\nMultiplayer in RAGE seems like an afterthought. I generally don't get too invovled in fps multiplayer modes due to general lack of interest, but in RAGE the coop was very fun for a few days. The voice chat feature worked great and saved me from needing to be on my Mumble client. My friend and I cleared everything on both difficulites except three missions. We never finished the Bash TV episodes on Nightmare (good God), and due to an end level glitch we could not finish Grab and Go on Nightmare.\n\nAlso, where are all the people for the races? Even on the f2p weekend I saw no one on it. We sat for quite a while and I tried solo que a few times with no luck. Two Steam achievements I won't get unless I get two more people on my friends list who have the game and we just que up with four of us. C'mon now...so many in game badges based on the multiplayer races and no one is attempting it? Requiring four people before I can even launch the race keeps us forever alone. Seems like a waste to me, but then again maybe I just missed the golden era for this games racing mode.\n\nAfter almost 40 hours in my playthrough (I take my time and try not to miss anything...the first playthrough is the most important to me) I already know I will at some point play this through again. Most likely on Ultra for the achievement and normal to clean up any missed achievements after that.

While more linear and strightfoward than fallout, it resembles the characteristiscs of Borderlands.  The character devleopment and interaction fall more along the lines of fallout, so you do get the best of both worlds.  While maybe not as good as it's solo counterparts, this game is a nice break from the time one needs to put in when playing an open world video game, sometimes you want the post apocalyptic feel but able to play it at a quicker pace.  Weapon selection is alright, and nothing is more fun that shooting rebar out of your nail gun at a enemy.  Customization and crafting (for once) Is a pretty big must in this game as money is avaiable but tends to run out quickly since good ammunition is in short supply and must often be bought or crafted.\n\nOverall I would rate this a solid 8/10.  Good atmosphere, character interaction, and fast paced sense of accomplishment make this game a +.  The negatives are the low ammount of character customization, combat interaction could be improved, and storyline worked on.  Overall this game gets a solid 80%","July 1, 2014","true","17.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Futtbucker","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198050154712/","88 products in account","This is a must-play for any shooter fans tired of Call of Duty rip-offs and unimaginative zombie games that plague the market.\n\nRage takes a format of shooter I never knew I wanted and brings it into the light: fast-paced, frantic, edge-of-your-seat, run-and-gun chaos.  The best and most memorable moments include walking through a creepy corridor before being ambushed by bandits (essentially Rage's zombies) wielding knives, fighting a mutant boss while sprinting around and making use of the last of your weapon's ammo, or picking off bandits from a distance with a perfect headshot from your sniper or silent crossbow.  I could go on.  This is a game that, when at its best, relentlessly aims to leave you on the edge of your seat.  If you want the comfort of cover or friendly A.I.'s by your side, or like casual shooters that you can unwind and relax with, RAGE is not for you.  For everyone else, keep reading.\n\nBesides the frantic action, the game succeeds in equipping the player with awesome weapons and providing enemy A.I. that actually pose a threat.  Nothing ruins a shooter more than a bland array of generic assault rifles and pistols.  Rage provides the player with numerous guns all available at the tap of a button and every single one is fun to use.  The standout of them all isn't a gun at all, but rather a letal and silent boomerang called the Wingstick.  It specializes in decapitating bandits at the press of a button and was by far my favorite weapon in the game.  Every other gun performs remarkably too, leaving the player with a number of options to tackle a threat.  Will you take out that bandit from a distance with a crossbow headshot?  Maybe you'll run and gun with your hip-fired shotgun.  Or why not drive a C4-strapped RC car into a few bandits and blow them to bits?  The options are nearly limitless and always entertaining, leaving a satisfying feeling every time I achieved a creative kill.\n\nThankfully, the remarkable enemy A.I. prevents you from becoming too OP.  I was repeatedly stunned by how seamlessly the A.I. would find the most direct route to eliminate the threat (a.k.a. you).  Think that low wall in front of you will deter a bandit?  Prepare for him to scale it without a second thought.  Missed a headshot with your crossbow bolt aimed at a bandit 50 feet away?  Get ready to frantically pop off shots as he jumps from platform to platform and weaves in-and-out of obstacles in an effort to slice you to pieces.  The occassional bosses and mini-bosses also put your twitch reflexes to the test.  This is a game that puts your aim and reflexes to the test.\n\nThe frantic gunplay is where Rage truly shines.  Unfortunately, Id Software tried to change up the formula with driving/racing diversions and "open world" elements that ultimately fail to deliver.  I say "open world" because the game is really rather linear.  The only real exploration you'll do is on your brief, 5-minute drive to your next location.  As I mentioned earlier, the tight corridors and frantic, edge-of-your-seat gunplay are where Rage stands out from modern shooters.  Id's decision to tack on generic open world elements is not only surprising, but also takes away from what makes Rage unique and entertaining.  You are encouraged throughout the game to battle enemy vehicles with your vehicle-mounted minigun/rocket-launcher combo and compete in races.  While the on-foot A.I. are challenging, the driving A.I. never pose much of a threat.  The game encourages you to spend money on vehicle upgrades, but the enemy vehicles are so easy and the "open world" is so small and lackluster that I never bought any car upgrades beyond what I was required to to progress.\n\nUsually an engaging story and entertaining missions can save a boring open world and crappy driving gameplay.  But the story and missions are easily Rage's worst features.  The game opens with an epic scene of a spaceship crashing onto a planet.  The player steps out of the reckage to witness a beautifully rendered, post-apocalyptic wasteland and through a series of conversations essentially finds out he is the chosen one from a distant past.  Beyond that, I had absolutely no idea what was happening in the story.  For some reason, my character was special and the enemies wanted me dead.  The narrative was so poorly explained and random that I can't imagine anyone playing the game to actually follow along.  Unfortunately, the missions aren't much better.  Prepare for fetch quests galore that you perform for no real reason.  The main storyline is essentially ditched in favor of short tasks that involve getting upgrades to ultimately defeat...something?  I was never sure who the main enemy was or what I was working towards in the game.\n\nThankfully, I didn't really care.  The gunplay was so fun that I was eager to help gather some generic supplies for Mr. Cartoonish Mayor, just to decapitate a few more bandits.  The driving segments are short enough to never be game-breakingly annoying.  And the enemies were engaging enough to never stop me from sitting on the edge of my seat, anxiously anticipating the next bandit to sprint at me with a knife.  The odd steampunk setting mixed with a generic post-apocalyptic wasteland didn't do much for selling me on the narrative or goofy characters.  But ultimately it didn't matter, as Rage is a stellar game that every shooter fan should play.","July 4, 2014","true","8.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cyper064/recommended/9200/","cyper064","Cyper","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cyper064/","336 products in account","Gaphical Fidelity: ID outdid themselved with the visuals of this game. The texture qualities themselves may not be astounding. But the vastness of the world and details of each individual component make it quite a breath-taking sight. For me, it is still one of the most visually appealing games i've played. The artstyle is damn impressive.\n\nPerformance: As much as i'd like to say all good things about this game. The texture popping is something that was an issue on release, and still has not been properly patched till this day. It's not a major issue, and not too noticeable on my computer rig, but it doesn't exactly make ID look like they put a lot of time into fixing the game.\n\nDesign: I love the character and map design. Each enemy type has so many different variations, it doesn't feel too repetetive when fighting them. Plus the characters you talk to are each unique and memorable in their own way, wether it be serious and rought around the edges, or kind of goofy.\n\nRPG Aspects: This is something that kind of looks like it was shoved in last second. Don't get me wrong, it works, but it feels unfinished. You don't have any stats you can mess around with for your character. The clothing you wear is picked out of 3 different variations near the beginning of the game, meaning not a lot of variety. There are basic upgrades for armour, and for your individual weapons, but they are very basic. The coolest part would probably be the item crafting. Even though it is quite simple. It makes you go looking for the unique parts required to make certain items, such as the explosive RC cars, lock drills, bandages, etc.\n\nStory: Honestly, story could have been better. It sets the tone quite early on and I quite liked how it began, but without spoiling anything, the ending was a bummer and quite of left you hanging. Plus, you can't continue playing after the campaign to explore which I thought was silly. The ending really allowed for it...\n\nVoice Acting: Voice acting was fantastic, I don't have any issues with it. Frankly they had me at John Goodman.\n\nAI: The enemies AI was frankly one of the best parts of the game. They aren't your typical baddies that just stand there or rush directly at you. They were far cleverer than I expected. I found that enemies with melee weapons would duck and weave to avoid your shots, plus jumping, rolling and climbing to make them quite adept at reaching you without being hit. Any with ranged weapons wouldn't just stand there, but use cover wisely. Retreat if you were bearing down hard on them, advance if they found they had an advantage. Not just that, sometimes they would work together; for instance, the Authority had units that defended with a energy shield, and other units would hide behind him for protection.\n\nWeapons: The weapon design was quite good, but what made the guns so much fun to use, is their sounds, kickback, and also the phsyics implemented when an enemy was downed. If you shot an enemy in the head, their helmet would fall off, shoot them in the leg, they'll limp or topple over. Hit them with a shotgun, they'd go barreling through the air. As a FPS, I absolutely approve, and found the shooting aspect solid.\n\n____________________\nPresentation: 7 (Clearly high production, but story was weak and not all the characters were that memorable)\nGraphics: 7.5 (I would of given this a higher rating if the texture popping issue was fixed)\nSound: 8.5 (Sound was overall impressive, especially on the weapons. Plus voice acting was above par most of the time)\nGameplay: 8 (Excellent shooting sequences, but I did find the car comabt kind of tedious)\nOverall: 8 (A large amount of content for Single player, but only about 7-8 hours for the campaign. Does include co-op missions and a car combat competetive mode which is nice)","March 23, 2014","true","14.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","2"

RAGE is a first person shooter! A lot of people don’t seem to understand that, but it has been pretty clear from the start. This is NOT another Fallout or Borderlands! I don’t understand where everybody keeps getting this from. RAGE differs from Doom 3 in the fact that there are “safe” areas and the main world map has opened up a little bit giving you freedom and a break from shooting stuff with your shotgun, but at the heart of things it is still a FPS.\n\nPros:\nRage was created by id software meaning that the shooting is superb. Every weapon just feels good and sounds like it should.\nWingsticks: The wingstick is the best weapon in the game. It is essentially an offhand quick use weapon that is a sharp boomerang of decapitations.\n\nMega Textures: Id Tech 5 uses mega textures which make the game look gorgeous (when you are far away). Driving around in your armed buggy outside in the wasteland looks amazing and has a great feel to it.\nWater: The water in RAGE looks really good. There is not a whole lot of it and there is no swimming, but it does look good.\n\nMemorable Characters: The townsfolk that you run into are often a bit goofy like they stared at the sun too long, but they stick in your head.\n\nEnemy Mobility: The enemies in RAGE are very agile (especially the mutants) and often climb on the walls or ceiling or are jumping over a rail or down a floor.\n\nOther “Weapons”: There is more to RAGE than the shotgun (though the shotgun is always a good bet) there are items that you can “build” such as the sentry turret or bot and use them to help you out on your journey.\n\nDLC: If you are liking RAGE get the DLC and play it after you finish the game, since it gives a better ending.\n\n\nCons:\nMega Textures: The down side of mega textures is when you are close up. If you go up to a soup can on the self it is all but a blur. There are some resources that can help to make this problem better, but it can only get so good due to the lack of higher quality texture file released by id.\n\nTexture Popping: Basically you have a higher texture quality popping into place when you turn around in the game. This is a fairly common issue among lower end computers, and can be a primary reason to not play this game. There are some fixes for this but generally if you have a higher computer it won’t be an issue. Note: AMD cards have been known to have performance issues, but I haven’t experienced this.\n\nSaves: The auto save feature in RAGE is all but broke. Don’t rely on it. Save your game whenever you want manually… Simple as that.\n\nStory/Game World: The story of the game started out pretty good, but went downhill quite quickly. I felt like you are the only person in the game world that can do anything, and things like money are only there for you to use. The world is fairly static and default jump height doesn’t allow you to jump up on boxes or crates.\n\nEnding: RAGE is essentially the first part in a two part story/game and the ending shows it. The ending makes since, but ultimately it is a letdown.\n\n\nAt the end of the day I really like RAGE and think that it is a great game, though it has been overlooked because of these issues. Hopefully id can fix this stuff and produce an amazing Doom 4, but we will have to wait and see. Overall, I would recommend this game to anyone that likes FPS games and to pick it up with the DLC when it is on sale.\n\n\n","February 21, 2014","true","161.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I was very impressed with the game's technical execution, BUT the substance of the game is lacking, unfortunately. At the time of my playthrough, I believe I had already played tons of hours in Borderlands, which I had also already beaten, so it really felt like a clone of that experience. RAGE definitely has more in-your-face moments than the aforementioned game, which I would characterize as one of the main drawbacks of Borderlands seeing as I could defeat just about any outpost by utilizing ranged (sniping) tactics. RAGE, on the other hand,has more realistic graphics, which comes as a plus basically because there were more visual "WOW" moments over BL. But at the gameplay level, which boils down to movement and shooting accuracy, the two games are virtually identical. Also, I completed RAGE much quicker then BL, why I'm not entirely sure.. maybe because I was used to the gameplay style via BL, or maybe it was somewhat less challenging seeing that most of the encounters were close-up, trying to surprise me -- which was a lesson previously taught by Doom 3 by the way. Overall, I would have to not recommend this game if you have played Borderlands, which came out before this, so...y'know. Otherwise, I give it my full recommendation.","November 7, 2015","false","31.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Somnambuls/recommended/9200/","Somnambuls","D.Cosmos [lv]","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Somnambuls/","233 products in account","Rage is a mixed bag. There were times, when I was thinking "Wow, this is one of my favourite games", and then there were times, when I was cursing the devs for lack of balance (or my lack of gaming skills – depends on your perspective). But I definitely would recommend this game as a great example of FPS.\n\nFeatures:\n\n- Great setting that really provides a genuine sense of a post-apocalyptic world.\n- Decent amount of weapons with different kinds of ammo (a pistol, an assault rifle, a shotgun, a sniper rifle, a crossbow, a nail gun, a rocket launcher, a machine gun, a pulse cannon).\n- Crafting options that improve your statistics and arsenal (health upgrades, armor upgrades, wingsticks, bandages, turrets, sentry bots, bomb cars, EMP grenades, lock grinders, mind control bolts (!), health boosts, damage boosts etc.)\n- Four types of vehicles: a quadricycle, a buggy, a pick-up truck and an armored vehicle. The latter three are upgradable and eventually have three types of guns (a mini-gun that shoots bullets, a rocket launcher and a pulse cannon).\n- Three types of character customisation. Not that it matters much.\n- Fun side-missions\n- Mini-games (a card game, a knife game, wingstick throwing, roulette, poker, a kind of board game and banjo play). I basically played only the card game, the others were too boring.\n- Racing challenges where you can earn racing certificates required for vehicle upgrades\n- Interesting characters and enemies. There are basically three kinds of enemies: bandits (Vasted Clan, Shrouded Clan, Jackals, Ghost Clan, Gearheads, Scorchers), mutants and the Authority. Each of them require different approach.\n- Easter eggs and hidden arenas with references to previous iD releases (Doom and Wolfenstein). See the guides and YouTube for more info.\n- Sexy girls with funny monologue lines\n- A trophy room\n- Collectible cards (hard to obtain, but you have no other choice if you want to win the card mini-game). There are two achievements for that: one for collecting all cards and one for beating the most difficult deck.\n- Multiplayer and co-op. They're basically dead. Couldn't connect with my friend to play the Co-Op missions\n- An option to change difficulty during the gameplay.\n\nPROS:\n- Great, vivid graphics, but, as far as I've heard, they're better on consoles. Though, this is true only for landscapes, because the close-ups are lacking detail (e.g., blurred text, simplified texture).\n- Tactical gameplay. It's not just straightforward shooting. Your weapon and ammunition choice really matters, you need to use different approaches for different enemies. You can rush forward and take your chances with fast and strong weapons or take your enemies out one by one from cover or you can throw grenades and set back or you can take their heads off with wingsticks or a shotgun or you can stealth-attack with arrows and wingsticks - the choice is yours. You can even use turrets and bomb cars or mind-control enemies turning them into suicide bombers.\n- Interesting (though a simple) storyline with gradual and smooth progression but and abrupt ending.\n\nCONS:\n- Too much focus on racing for my taste. Also, some of the rally point missions and the third mail delivery mission are too difficult in my opinion. I managed to complete all of them, but seeing, how AI drivers steal rally points right under your nose half the time, was a bit frustrating at times.\n- Everything is expensive. You're constantly out of ammo or out of money. I had the same problem with Wolfenstein: NWO. I guess it's a kind of iD/Bethesda thing.\n- Some of the missions are too challenging. Challenge is a challenge, but when chordes of armored mutants are rushing towards you and you don't have time to properly aim and you require a whole magazine per enemy, it's no fun at all.\n- Video tearing on camera turns. You either need to lower your video settings or try manual configuration (see the guides for more info).\n- An abrupt ending of the storyline. Leaves a feeling that game was not fully completed.\n\nNevertheless, I think that iD is a great developer and all their games are great, with RAGE being no exception.\n\nMy overall rating: 9/10. And, yes, the DLC is worth the money.","September 26, 2014","true","36.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The only part i would say is not lazy is the scorchers DLC. it is a good DLC but doesnt off set the poor qualities of the game like the laziness of the construction, the lack of respawning enemies outside missions plus salvage doesnt respawn either (both of which leaves completed areas desolate after missions and can make it difficult for the more trigger happy players to keep ammo up to stock), the story line starts off good but gets weaker and weaker closer to the end and the ending makes the game feel cut short with no final boss, the racing elements of the game feel like they have been jammed in where they arent really needed and dialoge is not skipable which can get irrirating, weapon customisation is available but is very limited on only applies to a handful of weapons, gadgets are only usable in a handful of occasions (with the exception of grenades and sentury bots) and finally voice acting is mostly appauling. The mini games are decent, nothing overly special but decent to earn a little extra cash. The AI is a redeeming light of the game and does make the combat more interesting and the differnt ammo types can give additional punch when needed.\n\nover all the game was okay to play and leaves me feeling that the game didnt live up to all i expected it to be and doesnt make use of all of its potential with the exception of the scorchers DLC which is good but ends up being fairly short and objectives can be a little vauge.","May 1","true","16.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The world is populated by human survivors of the impact, who have come together to form settlements around oases and other practical or habitable locations, including racetracks. These fragile homes are diligently defended by the inhabitants against bandits and mutants, which are divided into various gangs and organizations of their own. Now you the ark survivor comes into the world in the year 2135. Now this game gave me the feel of Fallout which I liked very much. Now people may say fallout rip off. Which I admit ok. But really its not exactly the same. It might start nearly the same but its just a different game. Any way. You fight your way through three area's to help bring the world back from the brink of its near destruction from the Asteroid. I liked this. A nice fit for survival.\n\nGame Play: The game primarily consists of FPS and driving area's, with the you using vehicle's to explore the world and travel between missions. Combat is in first person view. You are armed with a variety of firearms from pistols to a nice rocket launcher and my favorite weapon wing sticks (They are like boomerangs). You get different ammo for each weapon. Which you can change to your style. There is two types of enemies Shooting and melee, no need to explain what they do since its easy to figure out.\n\nNow there is several vehicle events for you to participate in. Races and checkpoint rallies. Racing events may or may not have opponents, and some of them are armed races while others are not. You have the ability to augment you cars with various items and upgrades you can gain by completing events. Rage also some (RPG) elements, inventory system, looting system and Also able to build a wide assortment of items using collected recipes. There are also side missions and a number of other minor exploratory elements to the game.\n\nNow this game is not fully open world like many out there. Yes you are restricted. But there is still a lot you can do. So do not let the closed world put you off. The game is fun and an interesting story to it to.\n\nControls: Easy and simple for anyone to use. Not much else to say on that. Controls can be customized to how you like it of course via keyboard and mouse.\n\nThe Graphics: The Graphics are really great. The characters and weapons had me drolling. Never seen such good graphics on my system like that and I am not usually some one for graphics.\n\nMusic: It was good for the game. But for this game I turned it off so I could pay more attention to the game, sometimes I find music distracting in games.\n\nBugs and Glitches: Right this was a big issue. Poor pc compatibility with this port. Rendering issues on the graphics and glitches in the sound along with (CTD's) But with user tweaks and fixes the game got better there was still issues but not as many for me it was just CTD's caused by my xfire. Technical issues with the PC version has led to articles explaining to users how to "fix" Rage's problems. AMD had released drivers that attempt to fix some the issues. Then on October 10, 2011 patches for the Windows version were released which added various graphical options to the game and fixed a number of driver-related graphical issues.\n\nReply Value: Sadly I do not find any reply value in this game at all. Its a one time play in my books.\n\nOverall: Now the story is good in my books. Game play is good to but there is room for improvements. Controls are easy as I have said. Graphics are amazing. Music is good. Graphics really great. There is bugs and glitches in the game and most are fixed via user help and drivers and a patch. Even for a poorly ported game. This was quiet fun and exciting for me. The ending was nice to shows for a possible squeal. But I am not going to tell you the ending. So my rating for this game will be 7 paws for this good game.","May 17","true","7.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

So, it’s a little bit like Mad Max then? Well, it’s about 99% Mad Max-like. I mean you’re going to see insane weaponry, vehicular combat and bandit gangs, so it’s safe to say that this is a Mad Max themed shooter, but definitely not a movie clone.\n\nGraphics: 10/10\nFor a game that is nearly 5 years old, it still impresses me on how good it looks. It’s not “perfect” by any means, but its good enough that you will think that this game is newer than it looks. Not to mention that you don’t need an overly powerful graphics card to run it; a GeForce 9800 GTX or an AMD equivalent is just enough to get playable framerates. This also goes for both the CPU and RAM. No need for a fancy £1000 rig to enjoy this game.\n\nStoryline: 7/10\nYou are emerged into a wasteland earth full of bandits, gangs and mutants. You are seen as the ‘hero’ of the game and you learn more about the places and the people the more you play further into the story. It’s the generic story where you defeat all the mutants and gangs, whilst doing unrelated side-quests along the way and eventually “save” the world. It’s nothing new to the table in terms of storytelling and I wouldn’t personally call this one “story heavy”, the game is an experience and is for experience, not to be fully immersed in it. It certainly delivers that experience in a decent sense.\n\nSound: 10/10\nThe sounds of gunfire, the roaring engines and the clarity of the voice acting is at its best. Every bit of soundtrack has been fined tuned to sound how they were supposed to be heard. I am proud of what id Software did here. What an impressive achievement.\n\nGameplay: 9/10\nIt delivers very smooth and very polished gameplay that many is sure to enjoy for hours. The controls are responsive and the game difficulty is well balanced. The only downside is that you have to keep checking if you have enough ammo for a weapon as ammo in this game is very scarce, especially at the start of the game.\n\nPrice: 10/10\nFor the price of £12.99 and an additional £3.49 for a DLC, it is reasonably well priced and is definitely worth buying. Although, I suggest waiting until it goes on sale to get it.\n","May 29","true","22.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Great mechanics and graphics. Ending could have been better as far as the "boss fight" goes.\n\nOne day, you wake up from your capsule and saved by a local from the bandits. You make your way through the main quest, which is mostly linear, by travelling with various vehicles. The game has fantastic gameplay, graphics, and a decent story.\n\nThe ending was largely disappointing though. I knew that the final mission was the final mission, but the ending was still very sudden and not as difficult as other "boss" fights. I mean, at one point, you fight a giant monster with just rocket launchers and only have a small room to navigate through, while the giant monster is outisde a gaping hole in the wall. The game certainly has its "wow" moments, and there are neat side things to do, like racing and delivery quests, but the main story could have used a little bit of work.\n\nThe setting is fantastic though, the world design is great for the coloring and character. It's semi open world, as in you could explore the every corner, but the main missions are the priority. After a while, you go to a different area and you can tell how vastly destroyed and different it is in the color pallets, it's clear that id games put a lot of work in the design.\n\n8.9/10","July 26, 2013","true","18.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PrimalHunter_779/recommended/9200/","PrimalHunter_779","PrimalHunter","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PrimalHunter_779/","383 products in account","Rage is a game from Id Software, one of the most iconic game developers of all time; Id is responsible for classics like Doom, Wolfenstein and Quake, and are a household name amongst the gaming community. Rage was pretty highly anticipated before its release, and the game itself created a pretty divisive fanbase.\nRage is set in a post-apocalyptic wasteland as a result of a meteorite collision with Earth. This makes for an environment made up of rocky canyons, dusty valleys and dark caves. This setting has been done quite a few times before, but the various gameplay mechanics and impressive use of visuals means that the world is rather nice to explore.\nYou navigate a moderately open world, similar to the first Borderlands. Using a wide array of guns with various ammo types, you'll collect quests from a hub, find the location in the world, complete the quest; rinse and repeat. The missions don't really have much variety as you'll often be completing the same tasks, consisting of killing mutants and bandits to get some item or pickup. Despite this however, the game will make up for it with some surprisingly solid shooting, and enjoyable racing mechanics.\nThe variety of guns definitely works in the game's favour. There are revolvers, assault rifles, shotguns, bazookas, plasma rifles, wingsticks, remote-control bomb cars, grenades, crossbows and sniper rifles. Not many games give you this many guns and I commend the game for doing so. The shooting itself is quite tight and responsive, with all of the weapons handling quite well. Enemy AI is also rather excellent; the enemies leap and sidestep around the levels to avoid your attacks, and it made the shooting really enjoyable and entertaining.\nThe game's best asset is probably the racing. With different tracks and game modes, Rage allows you to use modified racing cars to face off against other foes from around the wasteland. You can upgrade your cars with missles and machine guns, and this made for genuinely interesting moments of the game. The 'Mad Max' feel the game was obviously aiming for was really noticed her, and was one of the more addictive/memorable parts of the game.\nRage is a fun experience due to the sharp visuals, polished shooting and awesome racing. With little to no story and unmemorable characters, it is difficult to get invested in this game. If you enjoy mindless shooting and racing with visual flair, Rage will probably satisfy you. 7 / 10\n","August 1, 2014","true","14.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Not *bad*, just mediocre. It plays like an extended tech demo (which is probably is seeing how the marketing is hyping the game engine) that is, it takes the "kitchen sink" approach to game design, lacking focus. Everything you could want to do with a  game engine is represented and is polished to a glorious shine and it is shiny, just mediocre. The first person combat is entertaining enough. The driving sections are OK-ish and not actually broken in any way so they get a pass, I guess. There are RPG elements, but they don't *really* matter. There is crafting, which also doesn’t really matter. There is an evil authority, there are vicious mutants and there are good and noble rebels - which in game are called "The Authority", "The Mutants" and "The Rebels". You see? Mediocre.\n\nWhat wasn't strictly mediocre was the enemy AI which would (depending on enemy type) rather effectively take and use cover. This made the combat sections with those enemies stand out from the rest of the game, but not too far out, because this game doesn't really get to far past mediocre.\n\nI would also like to point out that for the PC you will most likely have to create a config file to fix several graphic and performance issues. Once this is done, the game will be beautiful and run very well, but a player should be able to run a game out of the box without having to do this, so instead of "Rage" getting and outstanding for polish, it again achieves mediocre.\n","May 15","true","34.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The game even employs a decent crafting system, u can craft some items like meds to heal or bombs and stuff like that to kill your enemies with different styles. There are few types of enemy in this game, mainly u kill anything that moves, make use of your weapons, there is so many approach to killing besides shooting.\n\nThe graphics are beautiful from far, it's like a painting come alive, but up close its terrible, its so blurry that u can compare it to the graphics of the 1st Half-Life game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Levyne/recommended/9200/","Levyne","Levyne","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Levyne/","141 products in account","I recommend this game...but barely. I actually sort of got interested into trying it after playing through The New Order earlier this year, even though the games don't have a lot in common other than their engine...which most people don't care for. Anyways, figured I'd give one of id's only "recent" games a try.\n\nRage doesn't know what it wants to be. I guess that's a common criticism so I'm not breaking new ground here. At a surface level, it looks reminiscent of Fallout 3, with a similar setting and even a rudimentary quest structure. However, this game is clearly an FPS and not an RPG. It also has vehicle traversal, even including racing and time trials. This wasn't what I was looking for going in, so outside of using the vehicles to go from objective to objective, it wasn't something I put a lot of time into. So I pretty much played this as a straight FPS, to the extent I could.\n\nI was instantly soured at the layout of the game. You are fairly readily given the ability to explore the Wasteland, which while not a sprawling overworld that you can really get lost in, it does have some size to it and I was happy to be able to simply roam around, look for enemies, get off and find places my vehicle couldn't go. It at first seemed like I had a fair bit of agency to do what I wanted. I found a little nook with a few enemies, eventually I found a body with a piece of clothing marked "Juno". How interesting. I then found a one-way shortcut to a radio tower of sorts that I couldn't get to before. "Oh, this is how to get here..." but I couldn't do anything.\n\nLater I go into an encampment and I'm told that I need to find out what happened to Juno, and also that I need to press a button on the tower or whatever. That's Rage. It's not the best setup.\n\nRage is all about being told where to go, and after this first anecdote, I was never in a hurry to explore past where I was told to since having to revisit the area once under orders just seemed like no fun at all. So instantly, the game goes from initially coming across like a fairly open environment to one where you're shackled to where whatever the npcs want you to do. This isn't bad in itself, since many shooters are linear without much choice in direction, but it certainly makes beelining across the Wasteland on the the buggy following the objective dot to be far less engaging. To make matters worse, many of the game's sidequests, conveniently stashed onto a conspicuous notice board, just require you to revisit mission areas, and maybe traverse them backwards with a swapped enemy set. It's a little uninspired. There are a few sidequests that require you to converse with town npcs, but most come from the boards, which I've never really enjoyed that set up.\n\nThe game performs well, outside of the infamous texture pop issue of the engine. I thought I was prepared after having played TNO but it's significantly worse here. Luckily the pc gaming wiki was able to provide a near-fix, but those first few minutes of getting out of the Arc were certainly an eyesore.\n\nThe raw gameplay is solid, I love being about to hold all of the weapon types. The game starts out fairly modest with a pistol, a machine gun, a shotgun, grenades, etc. After 5 hours though you're given multiple weapon types with multiple ammo configurations, and even quick use items ranging from emp grenades to boomerang blade and rc cars. There's lot of options, and I found myself willing to change up my loadout just to get a feel for everything. The quick menu configuration I thought was a little clumsy, with having to access the f1-f4 keys and having all of the various items just be mapped to a single button. Changing weapons and ammo, however, felt very natural. There were also a fair variety of enemy types the made different weapon usage quite the necessity (even on normal mode). Mutants that charge you straight on were better taken out with the shotgun and quickblades, while gearheads and more typical enemy soldiers would be better engaged with scoped weapons or grenades. Throw in the later game enemies with armor and shields and it was never really boring until...the end. The ending is supremely lame. I suppose look it up if you haven't played it.\n\nThe story is forgettable. You're just fetching stuff half the time.\n\nAll in all, the game is enjoyable once you get a texture pop fix and get over the rather lame quest structure and mini games and racing, And deliveries and sidequests. So yeah, a lot of fat that could have been trimmed. I think the game could have been a lot more polished if it had a focused goal. I suppose that's a bit tautological but I guess I see this game as being pretty exemplary of having unneeded side systems. I thought the crafting items were interesting enough, even if I mostly made the ammo and lock grinders and grenades and ignored the various boosts and bandages. The gambling games and various money sinks like trading cards, however, just seemed unneeded. Luckily that gave me more dispoable income to just try out various ammo types and build crafting items I normally wouldn't have tried. It also meant I didn't have to put a lot of effort into money-gathering events like deliveries and the monster tv segments. I just wanted to shoot stuff, you know?","August 24, 2014","true","15.9"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","1"

It was a game that was released too late. Allow me to explain.\nRage had many features that were standard in the industry by the time it was released, which made the game feel like it was either behind the times or just not developed with enough substance. I felt it impossible to not compare it to other games that were released in the same time frame and felt that it brought little unqiue gameplay mechanics to the table. The tropes of older games are also present such as bountiful backtracking, red shirt enemies and linear layouts disguised as open world.\n\nHad this game came out a few years earlier I think I would have received it better, but the entire time I was playing the game, it reminded me of something better I had already played. So take my "Not recommended" with a gain of salt.","October 26, 2015","false","1.6"," 11 of 20 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","11","20","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tsar_of_cows/recommended/9200/","tsar_of_cows","Galerath","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tsar_of_cows/","207 products in account","This game is like the kid who got straight 'A's in school, knew all the answers to every test, then went to university, smoked too much pot and dropped out in the second term. In other words, it's a disappointing under-achiever. It looks very pretty (even though it's getting on a bit), and it provides the illusion of some sort of open world, but that's all it is. An illusion. You're ultimately just shuffling from room to room and looking at what's going on. Of course, "it's a corridor shooter by ID! That's the point!" You might say, but it's even disappointing in that regard. You have too much health, there's too much ammo, the enemies are too stupid and there is basically no way to actually lose the game.\n\nI think I fell over about 3 times in total. And I mean "fell over" - I never actually died because you get a 2nd and 3rd chance through a "defibrillator unit" which wipes out enemies and revives you if you can manage to mash the E button at the sound prompt. And when I did fall over, it was because I couldn't be bothered using cover when I should have been. On top of the fact that you self-revive for no penalty, you get an endless supply of bandages that you can stuff down your throat to instantly restore your health. I used about 5 of those in the entire game, because it was just so easy. Of course, I was playing on normal, and I *could* have upped the difficulty (and I did for a while), but disappointment on top of disappointment, the higher difficultly levels just give the enemies more HP. This doesn't actually make the game difficult, it just makes every fight take longer and become not just easy but actively boring.\n\nI think the actual worst part, and what left me with a sour enough taste in my mouth to leave a review, was the storyline and the ending. The game is hurtling along, introducting all sorts of characters, many of whom are absolutely brilliantly realised and fantastically animated, and then it just stops. Suddenly you're on the end mission, you're handed a minigun and told to go activate a satillite uplink in the enemy base. You do so, get a 15 second cut scene and that's the end. There's no boss fight, no challenge (because you just mow everything down with afore mentioned minigun) and you don't even meet the big bad leader of the Authority (the badguys). Seriously, you hear his voice, once, and that's it. You never even see him. There's absolutely no sense of closure, no sense that you've finished up the story, nothing. It just stops dead and gives you the credits.\n\nI suppose I could also mention the races and vehicle combat. The races are ok. They're fun for about 30 minutes, but again way, way too easy and end up just a chore. This is compounded by the fact that the loading times are atrocious, so you spend almost as long waiting for the race to load as you do racing. Great. The vehicle combat exists. It's... there. That's about all you can say about it.\n\nIf you want a corridor shooter, go play Wolfenstein: New World Order. It's slightly longer, has almost the same story line, but is way more entertaining, occassionally actually difficult and has Nazis to murder. What more could you want?\n\nIf you've run out of everything else to play, and want to waste 7-10 hours clicking on bad guys, there are worse ways to spend your time than RAGE, but that's not exactly a recommendation, is it?","April 16","false","16.9"," 11 of 20 people (55%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","55","11","20","3","0"

For ID fans, this will be a romp down memory lane. Not much has changed since Doom and Quake except better graphics, a racing component and new gun modes. Gameplay was a lot like Doom where the only real problem was running out of ammo when too many enemies are thrown at you.  Calling this an RPG shooter, when one has played Fallout and Borderlands is a little laughable. The story is really, really unimaginative.\n\nStill, the racing can be fun (albeit not tied well to the main game) and the Magic-esque mini-game was entertaining.\n\nI think Metacritic was extremely charitable  to give it a 79/100. I would give it a 65/100 at best.","March 4, 2012","true","29.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Its not quite as action heavy or remarkable as say ...."Doom" made by ID, but it still has good things about it.    If you've ever played Fallout 3 you may have been impressed with the vastness of that game regarding the places to travel, guns to use, things to shoot, and people to meet.   Rage takes a diffrent approach by offering "quality" over "quantity"  Not saying that Fallout didnt have quality, but Rage gives a smaller, more polished and prettier experince.   You dont have as many places to go, but damn it looks georgous and you even get some sweet rides to take you there (the optional races in those rides are fun too).  You may not level up your character, but you get some wicked high-tech gadgets to become force multiplyers.   There may not be as many guns, but the guns you do get all have a role that never gets tossed aside and you obtain deadly new varities of ammunition  that changes how they operate and the level of carnage they can cause.\n\nThe graphics are amazing.  The character details are amazing.  The animations and behavior of the things trying to kill you are amazing.  No joke, its great to have one of the Ghosts do a parkor flip off the side of a wall to avoid your shotgun blast.  I was even suprised to notice that a NPC computer controlled ally of mine maintained realistic gun control and even kept their trigger finger outside of the trigger guard until he was ready to shoot.  Its this great level of detail that makes Rage a new experince that I would encourage others to try.\n\nWhats not so amazing?  The way it ends.   It seems like such a great build up for something that doesnt ever seem finished.  Perhaps they put too much detail in other things and they just ran out of time and/or money, but it seems like it ends to abruptly for a proper ending.  Not really timewise, but gameplay wise.\n\nAlso after completing the main story and the DLC you're going to be quite constrained.  In fallout and borderlands you can at least go around the land and shoot things.... in RAGE ( please correct me if I'm wrong) you cant unless they changed something in an update that I dont know about.  Once you beat an area enough times that area is closed off.  Kinda lame.","May 3, 2013","true","27.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The animators did a fantastic job at blowing life into A.I enemies which in general tend to be bland. But the animatiors really made the enemies look fluid and life like.

It is true that the driving isn't as fun as the shooting parts but the driving parts arn't bad either.  This game actually does a lot right.  It is varied and gives you lots of different things to do.  The guns feel powerful and meaty, as in any ID FPS, and it gives lots of options to customise the ammo you put in your gun.  It has a crafting system so you can make your own ammo and sentry bots and remote control car bombs and ....etc.  Wing sticks are a good addition and adds a new level of strategy when 4 guys are running towards you twirling through the air with flaming baseball bats.  The enemy AI is really well done.  In fact I think this game has the best AI I have ever played against in an FPS.\n\nGraphics:  Are really well done.  The scenery is really beautiful as well as character models.  Some of the inside textures are low quality but it doesn't really detract from the overall feel.  You just might not be able to read what it says on a vending machine or on a computer screen.  Does not affect gameplay one bit and there are plenty of high res textures in the game.\n\nSound: Very interesting soundtrack with the different guitar noises whenever you complete a quest.  It almost made it that much more satisfying to beat every mission.  The music in the FPS sections really sucks you in how it adds urgancy and scare the ♥♥♥♥ out of you at the same time.\n\nOverall I would recommend this game for ID FPS fans.\n\nIf at first you are discouraged because of the racing parts, just keep going, it gets much better.","August 26, 2014","true","23.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I personally only have few grips with it.\n\nCrafting : Although there is not much 19 receipt however I found all very useful Pop-Rocket is my prefer receipt and combine with the "extended loader" upgrade it is a life save when fighting Mutants on mass. And the high the difficulty the more valuable it is to craft.\n\nFreedom within a set environment: Personally I do not mind that it is not open-world actually it is better this way for me and you can revisit most locations on foot or in you car.\nI have never like fallout 3 open world always had the feeling nagging me that this is so much you have not explored yet even if I am pretty sure I have visited all of the marked areas.\n\nThe Story: Well it might not be a master piece but I rather enjoy it and it brings you along the world to new places. I will not say anymore to avoid spoilers as much as I can.\n\nThe Races: no not the different specie what I talk about it the in-build racing this scales with your difficulty and you will have to do some to be able to get the equipment need to complete and start some quest. To be honest I do not like that it is force but I can see the reason for it as the difficult would be too high without those items. After that you collect the currency to upgrade you car with other weapons, armor and front grill all of this helps you out in the wastland.\n\nBUG: there is a bug here when it comes to earn additional race credits from Sally amoge others I have found that you have to set it to active to be able to earn the credits. Thanks everyone on the community page your help was immensely helpful :)\n\nOne of the things I do not like, that I can voice without spoilers, is you have a set character no way to play as a female. It is not need but I prefer to be able to chose it for replay ability.","August 22, 2014","true","33.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's still fun though, especially at the beginning. Racing, shooting, gathering, crafting.... the game even gives you a believable reason for regenerating health.  The setting and gameplay will grab you, maybe not as tightly as some games but still to a degree.\n\nIt's only at the end that it all starts to fall apart.  While so much of RAGE's setting is fleshed out and detailed a few key things aren't, things like the bad guys.  The obligatory "Evil Empire" you're supposed to be fighting is really ill-defined and only vaguely talked about, except in the context of "well they're evil, duh."  Since the end game deals extensively with them, the game starts to suffer.\n\nThe absolute worst point of the game is the end.  The ending literally took me by surprise, as in "wait, that was the last level?!"  I will not spoil the ending itself, but I guarantee you will be disappointed. Disappointed not for what happens, but for what doesn't happen, specifically ANYTHING.\n\nStill, the beginning is pretty fun, and the underlying mechanics of the game are sound.  I would have been ♥♥♥♥♥♥ as hell if I'd paid full price for the game, but it was well worth the Steam Sale under $10 price I paid for it.","July 15, 2013","true","17.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Exciting, right? Well, it's got its fair share of flaws, so don't get too hyped up. The game feels slow at first, and it will take some time getting in sync with the arsenal. But it picks up just a couple of hours in, and whatever flaws had you in doubt earlier are now surpressed into the darkest, deepest, depth of your mind, and all you want to do is push on forward in this pretty post-apocalyptic shooter. Gunplay, vehicles, missions (aka quests), looting, and crafting. It's got what you'd crave from a game like this and it does it very well. It's not gonna blow your mind, but it'll keep you occupied for the +10 hours of gameplay, and you'll enjoy the time spent.

If you're a fan of Fallout 3 and post apocalyptic settings, first person shooters with a variety of guns, like driving vehicles around and even racing them in a side game, then you'll enjoy this game.\nIt's a linear fps with an okay story, some very repetitive quests, lots of driving around like in Borderlands, and it's not all that intricate.\n\nYou don't assemble any weapons, but you can buy an upgrade every here or there. The voice acting isn't the worst in the world. You don't get to set what your character looks like at atll. The game starts you right in the middle of nowhere, but you're immediately given a mission and a gun. From there on out, you do his missions to gain a couple more weapons and your own race buggy, though you don't really have to race all the time.\n\nI hated the racing aspect of this game, but since I went into it with gloomy expectations, I wasn't let down much at all. It was pretty simple, laid back and had a lot of tacked on side games and side quests.\n\nI hear the multiplayer is d-e-a-d dead! So it'd be for the single player experience if you're thinking of getting it right now. Which I've heard lasts around 8-10 hours to beat, depending on how much exploring or time you sink inot the side games.\n\nAll in all, for what I paid, I got a good amount of play time just waiting for me to log back in, but I wouldn't have purchased it if it hadn't been on sale. I'd say if you like SP FPS and a good sale, get it. If you like shooters that have a multiplayer slaughterfest of 1 on 1 or team vs. team, then this is definitely not the game fore you. But I think if you can get it and the DLC for 7 or so bucks, you should.\n\n\n\n\n","November 27, 2013","true","21.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Everything in this game has been completely under-realized, from story, setting, exploration, character options, crafting system to the incredibly typical gun procession (pistol, shotgun, AR, crossbow, well timed rpg) . I had great satisfaction in using the different ammo types and buildable items such as the RC car bombs, wingsticks, mindcontrol bolts, and the combat mechanics are very solid. It has some very fun moments and slick level design at times, but playing the levels forwards and backwards was sorta cheesy. Story was stagnant and the ending was aweful. Overall it feels like its been stretched too thin but the combat makes the game totally playable. Maybe a Rage 2 will really pull some of the potential in the game design together and create and standout game but this title is just a fun  bargain shooter. 21 hours played between the tacked on multiplayer and the campaign however and most of the time was well enjoyed but i know ill never play it again Pick it up on sale, beat it once, uninstall, not worth the full price or the 21 gb but certainly worth a go.","November 29, 2013","true","21.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

They leave the gameplay innovation to other developers. Doom 3 was already an 'old-school' retro game, when it came out. RAGE is a classic FPS in many ways. The weapons feel good. The enemies are popping up the same way as always. But the fidelity of the presentations is top notch. The animations are maybe the best you can find in new games & the levels are worth exploring, because id tried something new. They left the familiar ground and gave you loot and stuff to sell in shops. And they added a racing game in between the shooting levels, which is quite fun. You won't find pre-rendered textures. Instead, the lead programmer and mastermind John Carmack worked on his infamous "Megatextures", giving artists unprecedented freedoms to craft unique landscapes and levels without the usual restrictions. It's if 2D concept art would have come to life thx to virtual texturing. Worth seeing & playing, IMHO.","December 28, 2011","true","32.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kschang77/recommended/9200/","kschang77","kschang77","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kschang77/","993 products in account","Rage is a a polarizing game, as it seems to have borrowed elements from Wasteland / Fallout, Doom / Quake / Borderlands, and vehicular combat game (lot of Borderlands) that never quite meshed together, along with a storyline that sort of makes sense and sort of doesn't. However, it's NOT a bad game, mind you, as long as you take the game one element at a time.\n\nYou are some sort of an Ark survivor after Earth had suffered a major impact by an asteroid. You were rescued by a friendly who told you that you were lucky, if "the Authority" caught you you'll just disappear, and you have to take down the various bandit clans, leave no witnesses. As you help the town that saved you, you realize the world has even bigger problems, and as you move to a bigger town, the "Authority" started closing in, and that's when you were contacted by the Resistance, and they have a plan for you...\n\nAt its heart, Rage is a first-person shooter where you, equipped with large variety of weapons, from sniper rifle and crossbow to shotgun, two assault rifles, as well as gatling and rocket launcher, not to mention a pistol and a new age nail gun (that is essentially a SMG) Each of which may have two to three types of ammo, regular, and armor-penetrating, or something REALLY special.\n\nThere is no lean, but there is crouch (no prone though). There is jump, of course. And the idea is simple: kill or be killed.\n\nYou will encounter LARGE variety of enemies, some of whom use weapons (like humans) and some don't (mutants).  And every once in a while you'll run into a boss that will be QUITE difficult to defeat. Comparison to Fallout 3 / Fallout New Vegas are inevitable, but that's more phased combat and this one has some Quake DNA for fast-paced run-and-gun shooter. Enemies do try to flank, and some enemies like mutants have super high agility and climbs walls and ceilings (sorta like Aliens) to get to you in melee range. The Bosses are quite nasty, and some are HUGE. You'll sometimes run into minibosses, heavily armored gatling / flamer toting hulks too. You'll feel accomplished in defeating them, even on the easiest level.\n\nTo defeat the horde of enemies, you have your arsenal to count on, as well as grenades (explosive and EMP), and turrets (that you can build, once you buy or acquire blueprints).\n\nThe crafting part is what sets Rage apart from other FPS. As you roam the wasteland you will encounter various bits and pieces (ingredients) that can be crafted into various things, from bandages (rag + antiseptic) to sentry bot (which needs 5 ingredients) to little RC bomb cars, and even special ammo (like dynamic bolts for your crossbow). If you're a little short, you can buy ingredients from the merchants in town, and sell various junk (bottles, books, etc.) you collected for money.\n\nYou can equip up to 4 different items for quick activation during combat, such as bandages, grenades, and so on. One will be the default slot and the other three can be swapped into the default slot with one function key press. Same with weapons... swap among the 4 weapons in quick selection, but can equip any other weapons by hitting TAB to access the full menu.\n\nThe problem this caused is inventory management, as some ingredient can be used in up to 5 different items so you never seem to have enough. And if you want to hoard the ingredients you often run out of money, since selling ingredients aren't worth much. Selling finished items are worth more, but if you used up your ingredient you have to BUY them and that leads to lots of indecisions. The buy-sell interface at the merchants aren't the most intuitive either.  Not to mention the merchant sell vehicle ammo alongside personal weapon ammo, and that leads to even more problems. There's also mission specific items, finished items, and more.\n\nThe vehicles are suitably post-apocalyptic looking with welded on armor and various auto-aimming weapons, leaving you the job to drive. Yet driving on a keyboard (WASD) is somewhat awkward. This conflicts with the FPS controls (where mouse and keyboard still rules). There's nitro, and sometimes, powerups.\n\nVehicles have special achievements where you look for ramps to jump and crash into the Authority surveillance drones (which "proves" you accomplished the jump). There's also various bounties from bar owners the rewards you for taking out bandits. Combat is simple enough: enemy vehicles are locked on automatically, you just press the trigger to fire the appropriate weapon (gatling or homing rocket, with a pulse cannon coming late game). There are four vehicles: quad, buggy, sedan, sports car that you can own.\n\nYou can participate in races if you have a vehicle in town. Races varies from time trial (no opponent), to pure race (against various opponents), to no holds barred shooting race. There's also a special event called rocket rally where you need to reach the rally point first which gets you point, and you can shoot down enemy vehicles if it will help you win. Of course, enemy will do same to you. Winning races gains you money and alternate currency known as "racing certificates" which can be used to purchase upgrades (and paint jobs) for the vehicles.\n\nThe vehicles have 4 quick use slots too, which you can equip with shields (invulnerability), heal (instant restore), mines, escort drones, and so on, all of limited duration, of course.\n\nThe level designs are relatively clever, as there's really only one way to go through the map, albeit it'd be a pretty darn convoluted way. The idea is when you finished the big fight, you will arrive almost at the beginning where you go back to the entrance so you can make a proper exit. But this means the path can work only one way, and unless you figure out the trigger event you cannot continue. And that event is not always obvious.\n\nThe load time between levels are quite bad. And the entire game is about 8 GB of download. And yes, i was running the special 64bit version of the game too. it's still slow, but it still looks very good at 1680x1050.\n\nThe problem with this design is the game never quite knew what to make of itself... It's FPS with cars, but cars can collect "powerups" while racing on the track. The two just never quite meshed together, and while you can run over others, chances are few to do so, since only those who had their vehicle destroyed will be on foot. And that's rare too.  It is possible for a person on foot to destroy a vehicle with rockets, and there are even homing rockets but again, rare (and expensive). The whole vehicle thing felt "tacked on" to the game.\n\nThe plot makes little sense either, as it's another "huge conspiracy to maintain control". In fact, the resistance solution to defeat the authority makes no sense either. The endgame of the Resistance is you have to fight your way into Capital Prime, where you activate the Nexus which will activate ALL of the Arks, ALL AT ONCE, so the Authority can't capture all the survivors. Somehow this will save the future of mankind? Meh.\n\nOn the other hand, each town feels alive, as its filled with various fun bits such as minigames you can bet money on\nas well as a collectible card game (find the cards in the Wasteland, and/or buy them from merchants). The residents lounge around, sitting down, leaning against walls, etc., but some will wander, and if asked will offer their opinion of you or other topics. There's even a "job board" offering additional missions in each town that pays.\n\nAnd the driving mechanics aren't bad, as each vehicle feels proper (as much as possible on a keyboard) and they will even make handbrake turns and nitro burn (boost).\n\nThe DLC pack added a few more missions that can be quite tough, as well as a trophy room in town to show off your trophies for completing certain missions.\n\nThe game's still recommended, but don't expect a fully knockout experience.","January 15, 2015","true","26.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game itself is visually appealing and has good shooter mechanics, physics, driving combat mechanics and voiceacting. On the other hand, the story experience although being a fair length, is uninspiring, subpar in both content and execution and the gameplay feels like a series of fetchquests you would find in an MMO. The world is a postapocalyptic one, with mutants, human settlements/shacks, and bandits all fighting for control. There is limited freeroam, most of which is in your vehicle which is arguably the most polished part of the game. The driving combat is relatively well done, and overall is fun, and with towns offering race challenges you will honestly have a blast with this fair bit of content, so much so that you wonder why there is even a single player shooter game outside of this. Returning to the singleplayer story, it can be best summarized as Fallout 3 with better visuals, a very linear focus, bland execution and even vaguer cliche story. The game wobbles back and forth between relatively inspired story driven missions, and pure padding (fetch this, kill that), which although extends the duration you will spend on the game detracts from the overall experience (this is of course following main story arc, if you branch there is much more tedius missions). The game does feel like it is marginally unfinished or rushed in terms of the single player experience, and it answers few questions and returning to the previous points, some missions are well done, others not so much. The multiplayer experience is a nice touch, but has minimal longterm appeal, again the car racing is arguably the most enjoyable portion. Despite all this, the game is a worthwhile playthrough, although it is nowhere near the caliber of the obvious comparison of Fallout 3/New Vegas, it is however a mediocre first person shooter experience, worth a buy if you have the time and the patience.","February 18, 2014","true","16.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There are two main areas with what seemed like a dozen or so quests per area and then it is over. (I logged about 30 hrs, but really 20 of that was pushing the quests).\n\nThe weapons were pretty fun (like watching enemies dance when you hit them with a dynamite dart in the hand) but again I wanted more interaction with the Authority. I wanted more technology from them coming at me and more difficult bosses.  The weapon ranges were pretty cool and I wish there were some challenges in the game that demanded creativity in the choice of weaponry and bots.  You could basically go through the game and use only the shotgun pop rockets and the fat mamma's and be fine.\n\n(another fun one is the flame thrower guys.. just shoot them with anything you have and they will sort-of turn away... when they turn away exposing their fuel tank shoot the valve and BOOM)\n\nFrom 0 to 100 I would rate it in the low 70's.

The gunplay isn't overly technical and is polished as any other Quake or Doom game.  The gadgets are a nice way to make the combat alittle more different than the usual pop and shoot.  The weapons sound nice and beefy.  The cars handle well with a k/m.\n\nThis game isn't bad at all.  Might be repetitive for some, might be engaging for others.

Of course there are exceptions but I have far too many games I will probably never finish because they got boring.\n\nSure RAGE doesn't have the best graphics (although that painted sky is beautiful) nor does it have the greatest storyline, however, it's the kind of game that's genuinly fun to play.\n\nThe mechanics are fun (I especially like the wingsticks and deployable turrets) and who doesn't like blowing up a mutant with an explosive projectile fired from a massive shotgun? The missions are all slightly different and (at least for me) the game never feels stale or lacking in content.\n\nOnce you've finished the main storyline and the missions from the jobs board there are always the sewers to clear and now the scorchers DLC which, while quite short, I found to be increadibly entertaining.\n\nI get bored very easily and so there are very few games I have played all the way through, let alone gone back to for a second play though.

Movement feels a little clunky, perhaps a nicer "running" animation (more suitable screen shake and such) could fix that. The slight lean when moving left/right is really nice, and one of the main things that I like about this. Overall, I'd recommend this game for anyone that can stand bad terrain (IE: Walls, hills) and likes a challenge in shooting bad dudes.

It is not worth the full price at any rate.\n\nMainly because RAGE is NOT a groundbreaking FPS. It's a linear FPS that tries to look like open world and fails massively.\n\nIt's a fun shooter, weapons feel good and are varied (although I ended up using a good old shotgun most of the time). Driving around in a vehicle is enjoyable, and the overal atmosphere is fine.\n\nBut the world is only open to about ten minutes of exploration. Then you'll find out it's only a handful of canyons connected together and most of the locations are locked and accessible only during certain quests. Everything else you see in the distance is just a picture on the wall. But your movement is limited even when on foot. Most of the obstacles in your path (like railings, chairs, tables, crates and such) are surrounded by an invisible barrier that allows you to shoot through, but doesn't allow you to jump over these obstacles. Which becomes even more annoying when you see your enemies parkour-vaulting over them, popping behind them, or shooting blindly from cover - all the things you can watch but cannot do.","December 3, 2013","true","14.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In its own chaotic way it manages to keep the ever so used post apocalyptic wasteland fresh. There are more colours, lots of cool weapon upgrades, decent vehicle battle system and even RPG elements - skills, crafting and quests.\n\nIf I think about it in retrospective none of the components where really staggering but it’s the way they come together that makes Rage feel like really solid title. Mowing down hordes of nimble zealous wasteland freaks with mind control crossbows or zapping their heads off with wing sticks is for some reason just a ton of fun. Also the pace of the game is really awesome so you never feel stuck in one town too long and the explorer types get their rewards from all the cool little guns/upgrades you can find from the wasteland too.\n\nThe characters/dialogue part is also well done in comparison to your average FPS, but it really just serves the purpose of getting you into more trouble rather than telling an amazingly deep and interesting multilayered story.\n\nAdditionally there is a pretty cool card collecting minigame in Rage and a racing league. A few others as well. Cool.\n\nAll in all, an 8,5/10 in my book and well worth looking into, if you like shooting people.\n\nE: just did some coop action with a friend and my god the was that fun. just like intensest moments of the sp, just concentrated. well worth looking into.

Good fun. Unfortunately I felt a bit like I just wanted to play Borderlands during the gameplay. However there are many fun 'mini-games' and car races/events. Enough to satisfy a change of scenery from shooting bandits.\n\nThe missions felt a bit too 'samey', going into a hideout or area and shooting bandits to bits, you pass an area you can't get into as you go in and you start to realise you're just going to poke out of their in about 10 minutes time. But, the story within the hideouts change which makes it enjoyable nonetheless. The addition of screaching and random moments of being trapped in with muties bouncing around made me jump quite a few times as well which is always a bonus.\n\nThe ending [no-spoilers, don't worry] was a bit of a let down for me. I thought the story was going to be dragged on a bit more but it seemed to end quite suddenly and was easy to get to in the last area. Was expecting some kind of huge boss (like Borderlands) but only got waves of armored-muties.\n\nRecommended weapon:\nThe wingstick. Mandatory in this game.

On the other hand, the story experience although being a fair length, is uninspiring, subpar in both content and execution and the gameplay feels like a series of fetchquests you would find in an MMO. The world is a postapocalyptic one, with mutants, human settlements/shacks, and bandits all fighting for control. There is limited freeroam, most of which is in your vehicle which is arguably the most polished part of the game. The driving combat is relatively well done, and overall is fun, and with towns offering race challenges you will honestly have a blast with this fair bit of content, so much so that you wonder why there is even a single player shooter game outside of this. Returning to the singleplayer story, it can be best summarized as Fallout 3 with better visuals, a very linear focus, bland execution and even vaguer cliche story. The game wobbles back and forth between relatively inspired story driven missions, and pure padding (fetch this, kill that), which although extends the duration you will spend on the game detracts from the overall experience (this is of course following main story arc, if you branch there is much more tedius missions). The game does feel like it is marginally unfinished or rushed in terms of the single player experience, and it answers few questions and returning to the previous points, some missions are well done, others not so much. The multiplayer experience is a nice touch, but has minimal longterm appeal, again the car racing is arguably the most enjoyable portion. Despite all this, the game is a worthwhile playthrough, although it is nowhere near the caliber of the obvious comparison of Fallout 3/New Vegas, it is however a mediocre first person shooter experience, worth a buy if you have the time and the patience.","February 18, 2014","true","16.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

They leave the gameplay innovation to other developers. Doom 3 was already an 'old-school' retro game, when it came out. RAGE is a classic FPS in many ways. The weapons feel good. The enemies are popping up the same way as always. But the fidelity of the presentations is top notch. The animations are maybe the best you can find in new games & the levels are worth exploring, because id tried something new. They left the familiar ground and gave you loot and stuff to sell in shops. And they added a racing game in between the shooting levels, which is quite fun. You won't find pre-rendered textures. Instead, the lead programmer and mastermind John Carmack worked on his infamous "Megatextures", giving artists unprecedented freedoms to craft unique landscapes and levels without the usual restrictions. It's if 2D concept art would have come to life thx to virtual texturing. Worth seeing & playing, IMHO.","December 28, 2011","true","32.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The graphics is far ahead of any other game of its time, with its texture streaming technology where they've achieved the most realistic environments I've seen to date. Also, you will not see any repeating textures that are so common in other game titles.\n\nGame characters are exquisitely portrayed and memorable. Perhaps you won't find much back story for them, but this game is FPS with RPG elements, not the other way around. The game uses RPG elements to involve you into its story, it's a tool, not and end in itself.\n\nThe same applies to story line. Simple doesn't always mean bad. On contrary, simplicity is Zen, and that is hard to achieve, especially in FPS. Take Crysis 2 or 3 for example, where I've still no idea what's going on, despite replaying it few times. That's because story in Crysis seems like an addon, so I don't care for it. RAGE will make you care, for its story is essential to your gaming experience.\n\nVehicle fights are incredibly fun, but you need to take time to master it.\n\nWeapons are punchy and satisfying, with adversaries' AI providing just enough challenge to enjoy the fights. Close proximity fights are so much fun that it took me back to Doom2 and 3 days!\n\nThe time invested in playing RAGE will reward you with hours of pure fun.","November 25, 2013","true","29.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Solarmech/recommended/9200/","Solarmech","Solarmech","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Solarmech/","69 products in account","RAGE is another single word title game from id Software, creators of DooM and Quake. This game was the showcase for id’s Tech 5 Engine and as well as the first new IP from the company since Quake. As one would expect, RAGE is a First Person Shooter, but only part of the time. It is also a racing game at times as well as a vehicular combat game.\n\nRAGE takes place more than 100 years after an asteroid has devastated the planet in an atmosphere that is similar to the Fallout series in some ways. You play as an Arc Survivor, a person that was placed in cryogenic suspension to be woken up after the disaster to rebuild civilization. The player isn’t the average joe by any means. He has been infused with nanotech that enables him to heal amazingly fast and even come back from the dead. First the player battles the many bandits that inhabit the Wasteland, hideous mutants and then moves on to the tyrannical high tech Authority which aims to dominate the world.\n\nCombat in RAGE is solid and was certainly the most enjoyable part the game for me. The weapons “feel” solid and are varied. Along with different weapons are different ammunition types. Some types of ammunition increase affectedness against certain types of enemies and a few make radical changes in how the weapon will act. In addition to using weapons the player is able to construct RC Bomb Carts, Sentry Turrets and even lethal Sentry Bots to help the player out in a fight. No small amount of combat that occurs in RAGE takes place on the roads of the wastelands as you drive about. This combat can get a bit tedious at times as there is little variation in the enemies and they attack in a fairly predictable manner.\n\nThat was the good, now for the bad and that is the writing. I am not saying the writing is terrible, it gets the minimum job done. But it *only* gets the minimum job done. Most of the characters you see in the game come off as flat caricatures whose only reason to exist is to drive the story along, act as an info dump or give you a mission to accomplish. You really don’t care anything about these people. Even the ones you should care about such as Dan Hagar, the first person you meet on the game and he even saves your life. If the characters you meet in the game have any real life to them it is because the voice actor gives it to them. If Steve (Spike Spiegel) Blum can’t bring a lot of life to a character, something isn’t right.\nSometimes there are things that show up that make no real sense and can break your suspension of belief. Bandits with British or Russian accents? What? WHY? Heck, I remember one bandit complaining about how he missed Mother Russia. This is supposed to be a post-apocalyptic world. You just don’t pick up and move hundreds of people halfway across the planet without even a hint an explanation or reason.\n\nSomething that irritated me was all the references to other id games that can be found in RAGE. Now I am not totally against the practice of referencing, but there is a point where it breaks immersion. Unfortunately in RAGE they go to the point of shattering immersion into a thousand little pieces for no good reason I can see. From hidden rooms dedicated to earlier games (done in the same graphical style as the original game) to advertisements for DooM 3 or RAGE 2, to “Pinkies” a combined take off on Twinkies and the Pink Demons from DooM. You can even find the “numbers” from LOST in there as well as a “Pick up the can” scene from Half Life 2.\n\nProbably the best illustration of the problems I see with RAGE can be found in “The Scorchers” DLC. In this we are introduced to Sarah, a member of the Hagar Clan. It seems to me that she was supposed to be a character similar Alyx Vance from Half Life 2. But if that was what id was going for, they failed and failed badly. She starts off as a very good fighter, then turns into a damsel in distress at the drop of a hat for no other reason to give the player a reason to follow the bad guys. Sarah shows more skin than just about any other female character and struts and poses like a model all the time. Worse after going through a fairly traumatic experience she shows absolutely no reaction to it other than a “Thank You”. Wut?\n\nThe main enemy of the DLC (a bandit clan called the Scorchers) has a base in some strange ruins that look like they were built by aliens. In fact I actually thought that it did take place on another planet for a while since it didn’t resemble the environment seen in all the rest of the game. The end of the DLC leaves Sarah in the Trophy Room (Yes, that is the Official Name) and never leaving. If you talk to her she will snark a little at the player though.\n\nI guess the biggest problem I have with RAGE is that I can clearly see is that id seems to have been shooting for the next Half Life or HALO IP and they screwed it up. They had all the pieces to make a compelling universe that people would want to visit again and again, but they failed to bring those pieces together and relied on writing that is often flat and riddled with clichés. I guess the part about RAGE I dislike the most is the fact I can see the great game it could have been and is not.\n\nDespite my complaints RAGE is a good shooter and if you are looking some good FPS combat RAGE certainly delivers. Just don’t expect much more than that. sm","December 12, 2013","true","60.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Everything in this game has been completely under-realized, from story, setting, exploration, character options, crafting system to the incredibly typical gun procession (pistol, shotgun, AR, crossbow, well timed rpg) . I had great satisfaction in using the different ammo types and buildable items such as the RC car bombs, wingsticks, mindcontrol bolts, and the combat mechanics are very solid. It has some very fun moments and slick level design at times, but playing the levels forwards and backwards was sorta cheesy. Story was stagnant and the ending was aweful. Overall it feels like its been stretched too thin but the combat makes the game totally playable. Maybe a Rage 2 will really pull some of the potential in the game design together and create and standout game but this title is just a fun  bargain shooter. 21 hours played between the tacked on multiplayer and the campaign however and most of the time was well enjoyed but i know ill never play it again Pick it up on sale, beat it once, uninstall, not worth the full price or the 21 gb but certainly worth a go.","November 29, 2013","true","21.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

According to Metacritic (http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/rage), it's rank 55th best critic review pc game & 9th most discussed pc game in 2011, respectively.  Does it hold any meaningful  value or worth purchasing in 2015? It depends.\n\nThe Controls are easy to grasp. Visually, it still looks good to date. Game mechanics is good, fun. Aside from the FPS, you'll have racing and some other mini games to play. The combat system is responsive@really satisfying feel. The AI are fairly smart. You'll get to experience it when you put up a fight against groups of mutants and the humans factions.\n\nRage is set in an post-apocalyptic time. It feels like a combination of mad max & borderland. I'll give you the bad news first. You'll be spending most of your time driving. The good news?  No nonsense farming for random glowing loot & you'll get to blow up lots of enemies/vehicles/mutants while exploring the land -or-trying to get from point A to point B.\n\nUnlike borderlands, you'll only have a limited choice of weapons & customization to choose from. Some are pretty nasty & interesting (for instance the Nail Gun or the remote control car with bomb) BUT you'll need to replenish the ammo constantly throughout your travels. You either buy them or craft them from your salvages.\n\nThe road to richness is a long one, you'll get to play some mini games to to earn cash, a tv arena to earn more cash and a few racing arena where you'll have to invest your time to get the vehicles upgrade parts for your sweet ride.\n\nThe story is linear but definitely an interesting one. Not as funny/whacky than borderlands but is still refreshing to do them after X amount hours on the road (smashing/blowing up everything that moves).\nThere's Multiplayer option as well however I have yet to try it out myself.\n\nMy Summary:\nIt was refreshing and fun at first but after a XX amount of hours into the game, it gets pretty boring@repetitive but what kept me going was the story. The interesting fights/scenario you're put into. Late into the game however, there's a sudden spike of difficulty. That's a no-no for me. I wasn't pleased at all with ending. (There wasn't even an epic boss fight!) Despite the awesome guns/combat mechanic - there is no replay value for Rage. It was a sweet, one time experience for me. On the scale of 0 - 10, my personal rating for Rage is a 6/10.\n","September 30, 2015","true","57.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It doesn't show RAGE as an installed game. Interesting... I've been playing it for a past few days now, and why does it suddenly think it's not installed? So I click the Install button... Since the files are already there it won't take long until I'm able to start the game again. Now the plot thickens... Save game corrupt. Verrrry interesting... So I google it a little to no avail. I look inside the allegedly corrupt savefiles: most definitely they are corrupt. Although the file size seems legit, the files seem to contain only ASCII 32 characters. So yeah, no useful information there to be found. Fortunately it seems I don't have to start over, not all the savegames are corrupt, but at least 6 hours of playtime is down the toilet. Also I thought it is syncing the savegames with the Steam cloud but it doesn't appear to be doing so. It is syncing something but definitely not the savegames. Savegames are stored "safely" on local drive folder ?:\Users\?\Saved Games\id Software\Rage\base\savegame folder. Extremely frustrating experience.\nBut, all that aside I'm finding the game quite fun and playability is also good. I would recommend playing it. It takes many good aspects of other games and combines them. So there's nothing groundbreaking or original, it's all been there and done that. It's been fun and I've found nothing overly irritating. Durig the whole gameplay I didn't experience a single notable bug or glitch or a crash. Ok,that's not entirely true: only once I fell out of the map. Overall I am positively surprised, because all that negative feedback I read prior to playing the game had led me not to expect too much of it. But it seems that the bugs have been fixed and all the other issues addressed. Second part of the game (Eastern Wasteland) feels kind of short or rushed and the game ending is kind of anticlimatic. About downloadable content: Scorchers campain is just fine, but The Sewers - pointless... I played the game on Hard difficulty, it was challenging enough, didn't try any other difficulty levels. But it is a 7/10 game definitely, worth playing. Nice post apocalyptic game.","September 29, 2015","true","42.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Of course there are exceptions but I have far too many games I will probably never finish because they got boring.\n\nSure RAGE doesn't have the best graphics (although that painted sky is beautiful) nor does it have the greatest storyline, however, it's the kind of game that's genuinly fun to play.\n\nThe mechanics are fun (I especially like the wingsticks and deployable turrets) and who doesn't like blowing up a mutant with an explosive projectile fired from a massive shotgun? The missions are all slightly different and (at least for me) the game never feels stale or lacking in content.\n\nOnce you've finished the main storyline and the missions from the jobs board there are always the sewers to clear and now the scorchers DLC which, while quite short, I found to be increadibly entertaining.\n\nI get bored very easily and so there are very few games I have played all the way through, let alone gone back to for a second play though.

Movement feels a little clunky, perhaps a nicer "running" animation (more suitable screen shake and such) could fix that. The slight lean when moving left/right is really nice, and one of the main things that I like about this. Overall, I'd recommend this game for anyone that can stand bad terrain (IE: Walls, hills) and likes a challenge in shooting bad dudes.

Let me answer that question of yours.\nThe game is set in a post-apocalyptic future, where the civilization as we know it, has been destroyed by the asteroid 99942 Apophis in 2029. Survivors have created settlements and other habitable locations and have been divided into various clans and organizations of their own. Bandits and mutants constantly roam the world and try to salvage and destroy the settlements.\n\nThe story is your basic, “save the world story”. I could not get into the story of this game, it did not draw me in with anything special. I found no connections to the players actions except saving the world, but you are not greeted with an explanation to why the protagonist do the things he does. The protagonist is a mystery, who just happens to emerge and wants to save the world. I guess that you do not need more information to why you save the world, but it is a detail I would like to see, as to why the protagonist to the choices he does.\n\nThe protagonist, is an “Ark Survivor”. You emerge to the surface as the sole survivor from your Ark in 2135, and you are immediately thrown into the harsh world that is left. You are greeted by some bandits trying to salvage the wreckage of your ark, you are in an bad position as you lack weapons and equipment, but fear not because you are saved by a wasteland settler, who will teach you how the new world works. From here on it follows a linear story, where you do quest after quest which takes you further up in the world, and soon people will start to hear rumors of the “Ark Survivor”, and form here on the journey only gets harder as you try to save the world from its misery.\n\nIt is not that I disliked the story itself, I just could not find myself caught in it. I just followed the quest, did what I was told, and not long into the game I started to forget the story itself. But fear not, the story may have been weak for me but there were many other things that weighted in for it.\n\nThe gameplay itself is what lured me into this game, this is what kept me coming back to the game. It is very action based, with a lot of gun-play, and a few stealth mechanisms if you manage to pull them off.\nThis action is where all the fun resides. You can find yourself stuck waist-down in a firefight, with grenades flying from both sides, until you emerge victorious or die trying. But you do not actually die, since the Ark suit that you wear through the game has a built in defibrillator, so when you are about to die you enter a second chance mode, where you can revive yourself with a percentage of health and take out the enemies around you.\n\nI found that the AI was very good, and they have some of the more interesting mechanics, comparing with other games. Bandits dodge your shoots by doing acrobats, tactically advance and fall back depending on their amount, their health and how much health I seem to have. Mutants however swarm the area around you and charge head in, towards you, and jumps around to confuse you.\nThere are not so many different enemies. There are three main categories, Bandits, Mutants and Authority. Each of the three has a number of different subcategories, where you find a handful of changes like, different weapons and different armor, changes in movement and size. Sure there are only three main enemies, but with the subcategories and all the changes in between the enemies, you get a very dynamic feel towards what you are fighting. There are some bosses in the game, which are a nice asset. One is the huge of a ten story apartment and takes some time taking down until you learn the tricks, and another might just be a bandit in some bulky armor shooting rockets at you. I found the bosses to be a nice change from the regular creeps that are sent at you, and they offered a nice amount of challenge, to keep it hard and interesting.\n\nThe enemies had some changes with weapons, but what do you get?  You get an arsenal of ten weapons if I am correct. At first I thought that this was not enough, that it became to repetitive running about with the weapons you had, but all of that changes soon enough, when I was introduced to different kinds of ammo and equipment. Some weapons got explosive ammo, some got electric, some even got mind-control ammo. There was so many joyful ways to take down your enemies that I had a hard time choosing which was my favorite. The game rewarded you with different types of equipment, your primary were regular grenades, but you also had EMP-grenades, wingsticks (A triple-bladed boomerang), RC cars and some other things that I did not pay so much attention to.\n\nThere was a nice amount of side quests that you could do, from eliminate, protect, save, gather, races and delivery missions. They offered a nice variation to the linear and dull story, but there was one thing that blew away all of the side missions and that was BashTV, and arena where you could fight through some of the weirdest, immerse, amusing and engaging rooms filled with mutants of all sorts. I spent a lot of time in this arena, rampaging about with my weapons as I had to dodge enemies, spinning blades from the roof, spikes from the floor, you name it.\n\nA game cannot be perfect, while there was a lot of things that stimulated, but there were also some things were dull and for me destroyed the feeling of immersion. The first thing I have already mentioned, and that is the story. Then we have the world. From time to time the world appealed me, with how everything seemed to have adopted to the apocalyptic world, how the some areas felt unique. I found it to be way to empty from time to time, and I saw repeating patterns in how the enemy areas were made. There were no weather changes, which withdrew some of my immersion.\nI also felt like the textures on the environment were to low res from time to time, and badly made, compared to the weapons, characters and vehicles. I had some trouble with the rendering from time to time as well, seemed like the textures were not loading as they should. Other than the problem I had with the look of the textures and their rendering from time to time, the game looked good. It fitted the scene of an apocalyptic world as it was supposed to, sure there was the feeling of it being to empty at certain points, but what else is there to be expected from a game like this.\n\nThe controls were completely fine, everything did as I wanted it to, when I wanted it. The only thing I disliked about controls was that the camera was locked when you were in a vehicle, I would have liked it to be move able so you could watch around more. but I managed to look past it and enjoy the game for what it was.\nThe voices were well made, sometimes you got the feeling that some of the voices did not fit in at all, but it was quickly overlooked. The game had a nice soundtrack that kept the immersion in place, and made you feel like you were in the heat of the moment. Then we have the weapon sounds, I loved the sound of the weapons in this for some reason. To me they were very realistic, and the sound of someone blowing up or being electrocuted was amusing in so many ways, that it was close to disturbing.\n\nConclusion:The game Rage, is a very fun game to play, if you are able to overlook the issues that I found. I enjoyed it once I overlooked the issues, and I played through the story in about 8-9 hours. For me this time was well spent, by blowing stuff to pieces, blasting them in the face with a shotgun or trying the stealthy approach with a crossbow.\nIf you are a person that likes the action based games where it is a lot of shooting involved, and do not mind if the story is the weak part, f","March 4, 2015","true","8.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If this game had been released today in 2015 all patched up from an indie developer - it would probably receive high praise. This thing is $20 now and you probably spent about as much to go and watch Mad Max: Fury Road... if you did I suggest you pick this game up. The graphics are fantastic (some low res here or there), the sound design is impeccable (ambient, soundtrack, environmental and combat sounds layered nicely at all times), fantastic level design - the game oozes fun. The AI, though certainly not great, is at least very interesting, the weapons are huge, feel great and look great. The buggy sounds great and feels great, the character design is great. Everything is streamlined and simplified, almost like they took an arcade racing game, Borderlands environment inspiration, added some Doom 3 elements and tried to guess what Blizzard would try and do with merging the gameplay & streamlining to make it fun, polished, intense and somewhat goofy. This game doesn't dissapoint; however, the gaming public's past attitude towards this game certainly was.","August 18, 2015","true","14.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I remember it so well. First of all I have to say I was really  excited about this game when it was announced and after watching early build footage and trailers. I pictured Fallout with vehicles. I immediatly pre-ordered the game and waited for release day.\nMy first attempt at playing Rage was marred by graphical annoyances as turning in the game would cause me to see textures low rez for a second before the high rez textures would load. This was immensly annoying as the game didn't even look that great to begin with.  After pouring through forums and tech support there didn't seem to be a fix that would cure this bug so I continued playing until I got my first vehicle. This is when I stopped playing. The vehicles have very limited physics and the landscape are very limited in scale that there didn't seem to be any fun to be had at driving. I stopped playing shortly after that and considered this game a loss.\nFast forward years later and I decided to play it again, knowing what I did about the games limitations and hoping the texture bug would atleast be fixed. Now that is when the fun began. The vehicle part of the game is more like Borderlands  than some surreal open world driving simulator that I had hoped.  Vehicles have very limited physics and the areas you drive through are just large hallways that you go through to get from point A to point B with a few enemies thrown inbetween. But what makes Rage shine is the combat. Its what ID software  does best, the feel and sound of the weapons and the enemies reaction to getting shot.  After getting over my initial expectations I was able to enjoy the game for what it is, A really fun shooter. If your looking that and nothing more you will be pleased.","December 20, 2014","true","57.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Because of this, I have massive fanboy goggles on, and am aware of this fact, and now you are too. Keep this in mind, and so will I whilst writing this.\n\nMy first impression when playing this game was extremely positive. The opening cinematic, while being incredibly simplistic, does wonders for this game's atmosphere and is just downright beautiful. You are placed into the game without being assaulted with exposition, and I like that, so long as I can get it at my own pace during play. Discovery is one my favorite aspects to any game. The Visuals in this game are fantastic, ID has always been ahead of the curve in the graphical department, and this game really had me drolling with its visi-porn. This game gave me a gamer erection right away, and it persisted for much longer than 4 hours.\n\nThe meat of the gameplay consists of roaming what remains of civilization while both on foot and in a vehicle with the goal of surviving, learning about your own history, helping remaining survivors that want to help you, and obliterating everything that wants to eat you. Driving, shooting, and shooting while driving are what you do in this game: and those things are FUN. The gunplay is quite good because the weapons are fun, visceral, and ammo is customizable. Each meaningfully unique weapon has meaningfully unique ammo types, making it one of my favorite things about the entire game. Enemy AI being strong also helps make combat satisfying. Driving is fun because cars are customizable, badass looking, responsive, and responsible for lots of great vehicular manslaughter moments. I thought I would dislike the driving, as its main purpose is for what you'd thinks its for: going places. Thankfully, going places is actually fun, and it never takes a painful amount of time, even when you have kill people who get in your way when all you want to do is get to the mission location.\n\nExploration in this game is done in a way unlike any Ive seen. The game is a linear game but manages to not feel like it, and rewards mucking around and looking behind buildings and rocks that you would never need go near in the first place. Random junk like wires and cans all have resale value, and some can even be used to make random gadgets and gizmos on the fly, most of which are there just so you can mess around with more ways to murderize your enemies. The 'Engineering' in this game doesnt feel like a way waste your time or gate your progress, it feels like something a wastes wanderer would actually do given his circumstances and is way more fun than something so mundane should even be. Making RC cars with bombs stuck on them to blow up enemies who arent aware of you is fun, and is just one of 1000 ways to kill your enemies.\n\nEnemy and location design is also very good. Some missions are much scarier than I thought they would be just because of the locale and enemies within. While everything has that "crumbly, abused, neglected, dirty, or repurposed" design that most post-apocolyptic games have, it still remains memorable to me even though its been awhile since ive played. Variation in the urban and natural areas keeps it not feeling all samey, at least most of the time.\n\nThe story remains vague initially, which like I said before, is something I actually like. As you begin to discover and learn more and more, the game becomes truly engrossing, and had me invested fully, since it all felt as though I had discovered it, rather than it being rammed up my bum because I needed it to understand whats going on. Unfortunatley right during the biggest highs this game's story creates, the game ends unforgivably abrubtly. The sudden and supremely limp ending to the narrative and game as a whole is THE WORST IVE SEEN IN ANY GAME EVER. YES, EVEN WORSE THAN MASS EFFECT 3.\n\nOverall: The game succeeds at being a wasteland explorating, baddie smoking, vehicle smashing, scavenging and wrecking fun fest. I had a really great time with this one, and I recommend it to anybody who has liked any game where you pick up a gun and rearrange a guy's face with it. This game is very underrated and underplayed.\n\nGOOD:\n-GUN DESIGN\n-AMMO TYPES\n-VEHICULAR COMBAT/RACING\n-VISUAL QUALITY\n-ENGINEERING/SCAVENGING\n-ENEMY AI\n-F%$#ING STUFF UP\n\nACCEPTABLE:\n-ENEMY DESIGN\n-LEVEL DESIGN\n-NPCS\n-LORE\n-LEVEL NAVIGATION\n\nBAD:\n-THE ENDING IS ATROCIOUS\n-A FEW SERIOUS BUGS","June 20, 2015","true","22.8"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

The post-apocalyptic setting justifies for some mindless shoot people action. The game would have been a lot better as a cover-based shooter. The way it is you basically guess if cover is high enough not to get shot. The quests arent very memorable. Its pretty muh always "shoot enemy type x do thing a come back" While the characters did have a lot of personality none of them where very memorable. There is a small variety of minigames and sidestuff to do, play a cardgame, make cool jumps, participate in a race, allthough that one can become important since you get to most places via car and races are pretty much the only way to earn points to upgrade your car.  The weapons arent anything special either. Shotgun, crossbow, 2 types of machinegun, pistol (seriously who uses that thing once you get the other qeapons?) sniper rifle, rocket launcher and later minigun, some of them with multple types of ammunition. What it boils down to though is that you either use the shotgun or the sniper rifle. The only reason to not use the sniper rifle is if melee enemys are rushing towards you. Seriously, why bother with rocketlaunchers when a few good sniper shoots to the head kill any boss just as well? The crossbow is for a stealth approach in theory, but this suffers from 2 problems: Half of the time the enemies are already waiting for you and later on in the game the crossbow doesnt oneshot anymore, therefor rendering it useless for stealth. You can also craft some cool items, like an explosive RC car, a spiderlike killer robot (just like the sniper you need not bother with anything else once it is upgraded) and others. The races are all managable but require multiple tries sometimes. The story itself is nothing you havent seen or heard of before and mainly serves to connect one place you shoot people at with other places you shoot people at. The soundtrack gets the job done, particularly since its drowned in gunfire half the time anyway. The only soundtrack that stands out is the credit song (that I think is also the theme song? I dont know I always started the game before it had a chance to start playing)\n\nThere are two main weaknesses:\n1: a lack of maps. Half the time a map would have been really really helpful. Particularly in areas like the city where it at least took me a while to finally figure out where everything was leading to frustrated running in circles. The missions themself are so linear and leave so little room for exploration that a missing map usually isnt a problem though.\n\n2; That ending. As I said spoilerfree so here is the main problem: There is a huge buildup. You get the freaking minigun and the special "BFG-Ammo" with it. Sounds like a hell of a fight doesnt it? I even used up all the money I had left on ammo and bandages (health potions). What actually happens is that you gun done a couple of goons and boom done. Not even a boss. I dont even know what the BFG ammo looks like because I saved it up for something epic. Im not even saying that I think the story should have gone on more, just a boss even if its a little one, would have been very nice. The goons you gun down arent even all that hard to beat, I used a total of 1 bandage. The game had many harder sections than this.\n\nStill I recomend this game. Why? Because its fun. It is fun running face to face towards the enemy and pumping a shotgun round in their heads to watch them flying. It is fun picking them off one by one with the sniper. It is fun running around wreaking havoc in your car. At least it is to me. I dont think this game should have been much longer though because the fighting is growing rather stale over time.","March 9, 2015","true","21.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I was stunned by the quality of the graphics and character modeling (every NPC is 100% unique).  Think Fallout as a first-person shooter/racing game.  The story line is pretty generic, and there's far less content that I hoped, but what is there is great fun, especially for something that started life as a mere tech demo.  I can't stop playing Tombstones, one of the many gambling side-games available.  I sincerely hope they revisit this world and give us more to explore in the future.

Let me answer that question of yours.\nThe game is set in a post-apocalyptic future, where the civilization as we know it, has been destroyed by the asteroid 99942 Apophis in 2029. Survivors have created settlements and other habitable locations and have been divided into various clans and organizations of their own. Bandits and mutants constantly roam the world and try to salvage and destroy the settlements.\n\nThe story is your basic, “save the world story”. I could not get into the story of this game, it did not draw me in with anything special. I found no connections to the players actions except saving the world, but you are not greeted with an explanation to why the protagonist do the things he does. The protagonist is a mystery, who just happens to emerge and wants to save the world. I guess that you do not need more information to why you save the world, but it is a detail I would like to see, as to why the protagonist to the choices he does.\n\nThe protagonist, is an “Ark Survivor”. You emerge to the surface as the sole survivor from your Ark in 2135, and you are immediately thrown into the harsh world that is left. You are greeted by some bandits trying to salvage the wreckage of your ark, you are in an bad position as you lack weapons and equipment, but fear not because you are saved by a wasteland settler, who will teach you how the new world works. From here on it follows a linear story, where you do quest after quest which takes you further up in the world, and soon people will start to hear rumors of the “Ark Survivor”, and form here on the journey only gets harder as you try to save the world from its misery.\n\nIt is not that I disliked the story itself, I just could not find myself caught in it. I just followed the quest, did what I was told, and not long into the game I started to forget the story itself. But fear not, the story may have been weak for me but there were many other things that weighted in for it.\n\nThe gameplay itself is what lured me into this game, this is what kept me coming back to the game. It is very action based, with a lot of gun-play, and a few stealth mechanisms if you manage to pull them off.\nThis action is where all the fun resides. You can find yourself stuck waist-down in a firefight, with grenades flying from both sides, until you emerge victorious or die trying. But you do not actually die, since the Ark suit that you wear through the game has a built in defibrillator, so when you are about to die you enter a second chance mode, where you can revive yourself with a percentage of health and take out the enemies around you.\n\nI found that the AI was very good, and they have some of the more interesting mechanics, comparing with other games. Bandits dodge your shoots by doing acrobats, tactically advance and fall back depending on their amount, their health and how much health I seem to have. Mutants however swarm the area around you and charge head in, towards you, and jumps around to confuse you.\nThere are not so many different enemies. There are three main categories, Bandits, Mutants and Authority. Each of the three has a number of different subcategories, where you find a handful of changes like, different weapons and different armor, changes in movement and size. Sure there are only three main enemies, but with the subcategories and all the changes in between the enemies, you get a very dynamic feel towards what you are fighting. There are some bosses in the game, which are a nice asset. One is the huge of a ten story apartment and takes some time taking down until you learn the tricks, and another might just be a bandit in some bulky armor shooting rockets at you. I found the bosses to be a nice change from the regular creeps that are sent at you, and they offered a nice amount of challenge, to keep it hard and interesting.\n\nThe enemies had some changes with weapons, but what do you get?  You get an arsenal of ten weapons if I am correct. At first I thought that this was not enough, that it became to repetitive running about with the weapons you had, but all of that changes soon enough, when I was introduced to different kinds of ammo and equipment. Some weapons got explosive ammo, some got electric, some even got mind-control ammo. There was so many joyful ways to take down your enemies that I had a hard time choosing which was my favorite. The game rewarded you with different types of equipment, your primary were regular grenades, but you also had EMP-grenades, wingsticks (A triple-bladed boomerang), RC cars and some other things that I did not pay so much attention to.\n\nThere was a nice amount of side quests that you could do, from eliminate, protect, save, gather, races and delivery missions. They offered a nice variation to the linear and dull story, but there was one thing that blew away all of the side missions and that was BashTV, and arena where you could fight through some of the weirdest, immerse, amusing and engaging rooms filled with mutants of all sorts. I spent a lot of time in this arena, rampaging about with my weapons as I had to dodge enemies, spinning blades from the roof, spikes from the floor, you name it.\n\nA game cannot be perfect, while there was a lot of things that stimulated, but there were also some things were dull and for me destroyed the feeling of immersion. The first thing I have already mentioned, and that is the story. Then we have the world. From time to time the world appealed me, with how everything seemed to have adopted to the apocalyptic world, how the some areas felt unique. I found it to be way to empty from time to time, and I saw repeating patterns in how the enemy areas were made. There were no weather changes, which withdrew some of my immersion.\nI also felt like the textures on the environment were to low res from time to time, and badly made, compared to the weapons, characters and vehicles. I had some trouble with the rendering from time to time as well, seemed like the textures were not loading as they should. Other than the problem I had with the look of the textures and their rendering from time to time, the game looked good. It fitted the scene of an apocalyptic world as it was supposed to, sure there was the feeling of it being to empty at certain points, but what else is there to be expected from a game like this.\n\nThe controls were completely fine, everything did as I wanted it to, when I wanted it. The only thing I disliked about controls was that the camera was locked when you were in a vehicle, I would have liked it to be move able so you could watch around more. but I managed to look past it and enjoy the game for what it was.\nThe voices were well made, sometimes you got the feeling that some of the voices did not fit in at all, but it was quickly overlooked. The game had a nice soundtrack that kept the immersion in place, and made you feel like you were in the heat of the moment. Then we have the weapon sounds, I loved the sound of the weapons in this for some reason. To me they were very realistic, and the sound of someone blowing up or being electrocuted was amusing in so many ways, that it was close to disturbing.\n\nConclusion:The game Rage, is a very fun game to play, if you are able to overlook the issues that I found. I enjoyed it once I overlooked the issues, and I played through the story in about 8-9 hours. For me this time was well spent, by blowing stuff to pieces, blasting them in the face with a shotgun or trying the stealthy approach with a crossbow.\nIf you are a person that likes the action based games where it is a lot of shooting involved, and do not mind if the story is the weak part, f","March 4, 2015","true","8.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LL2125/recommended/9200/","LL2125","Dr.Larry","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LL2125/","605 products in account","Almost four years on and I finally gave this game a fair run through. It took me 18 hours of in-game time to complete including the Scorchers DLC with all side quests done and the pre-order Sewers DLC. Before this I could only play the first two hours before losing interest and moving on or the horrible texture pop-ins becoming a serious issue. The last time I played previous to this attempt was in 2012.\n\nIt's a shame. On release RAGE was an absolute mess especially on PC. The way id handled it was poor at best and really got under the skin of PC gamers. Both nVidia and AMD cards struggled trying to run the game in a presentable state and had severe texture pop-in issues which made the game unplayable on most machines. id's response to this was to point fingers and blame GPU drivers despite the fact that the game was basically built for GPU Transcoding which is primary to nVidia cards and was essential at the time for reducing texture pop-in. Despite this fact there was still an issue with nVidia cards which supported the feature. As for AMD users they were left in the dark even with high end GPUs. Simply put the game was in a sorry state on release and made worse by id's unappologethic attitude while also giving the middle finger to the PC platform at the same time in saying PC wasn't considered a "Prime platform." This coupled with the non-existent graphics options in the game was an utter slap to the face for many gamers.\n\nTo understand just how bad this game was on release and the lack of simple graphical options this video sums up perfectly what many of us had to deal with on release.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLuOtGwLnzQ\n\nThese issues are still there to this day on even high end GPUs although they are nowhere near as bad as shown in the video above and there are some graphics options that have been patched in.\n\nHaving just beaten the game i'm really disappointed that RAGE didn't pick up. It's obvious it was overshadowed by the technical problems it faced on release and the rather boring and uninspired combat presented to you in the beginning. For the first two hours the game is lackluster and completely boring, not because the world isn't interesting or there's nothing to really do but because the gunplay is so ineffective making you really dread playing the game. Fortunately -- or rather unfortunately -- the gunplay picks up considerably and becomes much more rewarding and fun to play when you get a few different weapons you can use but this comes a couple of hours into the campaign. For the base weapon you're given early in the game and how limited you are on cash and ammo starting out this game really isn't enjoyable for the first few hours. This is because all enemies no matter the difficulty are basically bullet sponges no matter where you hit them. Headshots won't one shot, they'll deal a lot of damage but they won't straight out kill an enemy but knock them back and require a second headshot to finish them with the pistol. It's extremely frustrating to have to sink about twenty bullets into an enemy to take them down.\n\nWhen the game opens up and you have access to RPGs, machine guns, the combat shotgun and the sniper rifle the game becomes the game id promised it was: A shooters paradise. Enemies are still bullet sponges but at least you have the firepower to counter this and headshots with weapons such as the sniper rifle are extremely rewarding. The combat shotgun is probably one of the most enjoyable weapons in the game due to the fact that it's incredibly powerful against mutants, enemies which are constantly up in your face. The combat shotgun is so satisfying to use against mutants it makes what is utterly creepy and atmospheric balanced in way of fun vs creep factor. It's just well done and feels excellent even by todays standard, making it probably the best shotgun to use in any FPS.\n\nThe gameplay is also pretty good in general. Racing is surpringly fun and the movement of your buggy or later vehicles is so smooth on mouse and keyboard that using a controller seems a waste of time. It's enjoyable throughout save for the ATV(Again, those first two hours of gameplay aren't great. id really dropped the ball here). The mission and level design are top notch later on in the game. There's opportunity for stealth kills in most levels and not much repetition in enemies. It's not simply wave after wave in each area but more of a scripted experience which is fine for a game like this. The repeats of levels are different and not lazily slapped together of "Go in and do this again but find item X or kill person Y." Once you beat an area it'll change according to the story so you'll see different enemy types and different spawns entirely with most levels being done in reverse so as not to feel like a flat out repeated process of the first time you completed the level.\n\nThe story is solid but there are pacing issues most likely due to the cut content because of the XBox 360 restrictions(The game was supposed to cover 4 Wastelands but had to be cut down to 2). For one you don't really learn much of anything about the current situation instead you're just helping the local people deal with their problems which sends you to bandit camps and mutant lairs to retrieve specific story related items or to investigate strange goings on. This gives you a good feel for the politics of the wasteland and how harsh and inhospitable the wasteland is which is a good thing.\n\nYour own story isn't really integrated into the main story which is a problem. In-game you never really find out who you are but in terms of lore and background, according to the wiki, you're a very imporant person being one of the top guys(You're supposed to take lead as top military advisor in the Ark Programme. The game also aludes to the fact that you've lost your memory from the beginning and you have to wait for your ID drive to be decrypted but this undertone seems to be abandoned completely come the end of the game and becomes an all out "This is how we beat them" with little care for anything else. Also, you're filled in on the most significant relevation in a rather lackluster scripted segment much like the one at the beginning of the game with Dan Hagar with zero build up towards it.\n\nThe ending... Well there isn't much to say about the ending other than the fact it lasts around 30 seconds and then just ends. It was a very poor ending and probably something that would be expanded upon in later DLC, DLC that would never come due to the poor reception of RAGE. Still, the ending should have been better and given a little more in return for your investment in playing the game(Like revealing the backstory of the protagonist through unlocking his ID drive). There's also a few areas that seemed to have been cut or intended for DLC. For one early in the game Dan and Becky Hagar travel to the town of Gun Barrel, this is a town that never features in the game but is frequently referrenced to by multiple main NPCs. This is either content that was part of the original 4 Wastelands iteration of the game or intended to be an expansion sometime after release. There's also the second town you visit which changes drastically the further you progress against the main enemy faction.\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed RAGE. It felt great for the most part and a lot was done really well in it. It's only a shame most of the goodness from this game comes after the point where most people lose interest. There really is no excuse for the poor beginning, the lackluster pistol and forcing players to sink 10-20 bullets on a single enemy. It just wasn't fun and more infuriating which is not a good way to start your game. Very disappointed now that the game wasn't expanded upon but here's hoping to the future and RAGE 2 to improve on all the shortcomings of the first game. It really is an alluring universe, one that deserves to be revisted in some shape or form.","July 31, 2015","true","35.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fubarhouse/recommended/9200/","fubarhouse","FubarHouse","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fubarhouse/","189 products in account","RAGE was delivered as a fresh new franchise (on release) which is developed and published from id software, and as a huge long-time id fan there was no question of me getting this title. It's set in a post-apocolyptic world (somewhat of a cliche' these days), and you're one of the last people from before this time preserved with microscopic nanites flowing through your blood. There's a high price to the Authority and the Rebels for you and/or your head.\n\nAlthough the high res graphics are locked out (which you can change through internet research), and it was off to a sketchy release loaded with issues - but then why should you trust any developer on release or close to on PC titles?\n\nThe game looks nice, performs well and introduces some nice mechanics. It presents a challenge and has a nice story which you can believe and immerse yourself in. For me personally, I loved the Rebar gun which was a part of the DLC package on Steam. The rebar gun launches a solid stick of ~400mm rebar or rio as we call it in Australia, and it can pin opponents to nearly any object, it can take heads off, it can take out multiple enemies with a really well placed shot, and it will terminate larger opponents with a couple of well placed shots - it does however take only one piece of rebar and reload speeds are slow. You are able to recover the rebar once launched, and it is the star of the game, so much fun.\n\nIt is however very linear in the campaign, but once you're off campaign there's much more freedom. There are a lot of annoying invisible walls, and the trading/shop seems a little tedious if you want to be well stocked at all times, but you can compete in an array of races to gain some currency.\n\nOverall it is a fantastic game, but for the average user I wouldn't rush about to complete it. If you're into FPS games and/or into id software's style I would say it's a must own. When you get a chance, make sure you enjoy this title - there'll be another one on the way once DOOM is released next year!","December 6, 2014","true","15.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Yet even the limp ending and slim illusion of player freedom cannot hide the fact that ID know all about shooting things in the face.  That is where the fun is to be had in this game; shoot all of the things, then throw spiderbots, turrets and boomerangs into the mix.\n\nThe world and character design are enjoyable, although you never really interact with them in a meaningful way.  Whilst the racing and mini games are briefly entertaining, they prove to be little more than resource grinding.  RAGE also harbours RPG and crafting pretensions that do not get in the way, but feel strangely unimportant as a result.  If any one of these elements worked as well as the shooting, ID would have been on to a real winner here.  Just imagine what this could have been like if they had nailed them all......\n\nAs it stands, RAGE has a solid core hidden amongst elements that either time, money or skill (all three?) prevented from truly coming together as a whole.  Seven out of ten seems fair, perhaps the ambition sends it a point either side of that mark, depending on how you take to the games weaker elements.\n\nShould ID have focused their effort a little better?  Perhaps; the game shines when played with a controller and employing a gung ho approach to ammo and resource expenditure, as the title would seem to suggest.  It's just a shame that other aspects of the game never hit those heights.","November 26, 2013","true","76.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Not only that, but i must also say that you can review black without knowing white, same goes for saying x is great if y doesnt exist... this means that rating is possible and legit when you compare to other games in its category or atleast with similarities... With this said... i give this game a 10 and i am surprised with the low rating and reviews...\n\nWhere can i start? well with the fact that, this is a bethesda game... so to those complaining about graphics.. they are perfect to me.. if you want a game to escape your CoD or Battlefield addiction dont low rate a good quality game just because graphics arent similar... On the same road, i must say that i am surprised that this marvelous fps game is from bethesda, since they are renowned for their rpgs. So it was indeed a great positive surprise for me...\n\nThe shooting is great, the combat smooth, the whole idea of wasteland violence and surprise attacks is just... 10... right of the bat i got spooked out with a bandit jumping on me. The fact that ammo keeps running low is also good imo, since it adds to the difficulty (which may i say, scales awesomely well... hard to see a fps with such a great difficulty scaling(usually its either dumb dummies or headshot bots))\nThe vehicle combat is really fun and interesting. Side quests (even though it is not an rpg) exist and are great.helpful and fun...\n\nNow... to all negative reviews.. i just gota say that, ofcourse you cant compare this game to cod or battlefield.. this game has a great story, and alot more than mere shooting, its bethesda... Comparing it to fallout is also silly, even though both are bethesda and involves wastelands, 1 is a rpg and the other fps with little rpg elements. I must say that this is also a great point for this game, the rpg elements are genious... they are just enough to maintain fps status but still give some extra stuff to do and work on.\n\nThis game cannot be compared to Stalker also... Stalker is also fps true, but has way more elements of rpg.. Its a great game also, BUT simply cannot be compared to RAGE. Whole different ideas, 1 has intense combat which is cohesive to the fact that you are being hunted down, the other is honest and loyal to the idea that you are a stalker... and therefore is just existing like other stalkers (scavenging)\n\nCompare this game to metro last light... which as i reviewed... is really really unfinished. Compare both games... both fps, both of them are post apocalyptical games and both pursue the idea of intense combat. However... metro has no side quests, no minimum rpg elements... many strings that you pull only to realise there is nothing on the other end...\n\nRage does have a story and its pretty linear... you cant simply cant get lost... if you get lost playing rage.. you should stick to basic left to right games.. STILL it manages to give you room to work on smaller stuff.. Yes the story aint deep... but tell me 5 fps games that get you immersed in its story....\n\nI sincerly find it pretty sad, to see critics unable to match their writing to their number rating. Even more to see players and pro critics alike comparing this game to cod when it comes to shooting and graphics and story to other bethesda rpg games... seriously... giving metro last joke a 8 and this game a 4.8 user rating is just ridiculous.... If you played stalker or metro the joke and like post apocalyptical fps games... Rage is an awesome surprise... dont trust ratings from people who compare it wrongly... just give it a chance... its bethesda ffs.... ID made great game aswell... why on earth wouldnt you try it?\n\nOh and to all bug this.. crash that... graphic that" seriously... people dont downvote jokes like darksouls for its pathetic almost unplayable pc version but will downvote this because it has better graphics on console?!? ilogical imo... The game runs fine... if by any chance you think its lagish due to low fps, press esc, go to options and there you shall find video options that you can change... judging by what i see on many reviews, this is apparently really hard to do...","August 31, 2014","true","43.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Looks great until it comes under scrutiny. I bought this on sale for very cheap since I ignored it on release because of it's early issues. I found it to be a solid FPS with some great driving mechanics (although driving didn't really rock my boat). Not a bad story and a couple of wow moments. The ending, although poor, looks to feed into part 2 so I would've forgiven it.. I can't see Rage 2 coming, so unforgiven :)\n\nBuy Rage when it's 3 or 4 quid and it's bob on.\n\nI did speed to the end as I had something else on the go, still took me 16 hours to push the main story. I would have gone back to finish the side quests if I'd got the option but the game denies you access once the credits roll, DLC fixes this I am told and even more DLC gives you a better and more fitting endgame.\n\nAll in all; fair to good, 7 lollipops out of 10.","July 9, 2015","true","15.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

After about a hour of playing i had to take a break because i felt nauseous and my eye's felt dry. It's the same strain level as Jazz Jackrabbit... The controls are a bit dodgy, the feeling of a bad PC port is big in this game. By tapping the strafe button you take a big step to the side instead of a normal step in all of the other FPS's so the controls can be called quite bulky, invisible walls are used almost as much as in the old-school Medal of honor titles which means that you will encounter allot of these, and the inventory system is just bad, you can clearly see that it was designed for a controller. The texture loads a bit slow, so be prepared for allot of texture loads while you play.\n\nOverall the weapons and character models look nice, the intro sucked me right into the game and atmosphere but as soon as the game really began it lost all of its charm. It's worth the 5 euro's i spend on it but if it is above this price i would spend the money on a game like Fallout 3 since this is a better alternative.\n\nAfter playing for 90 minutes i rate it a 6,5/10, mainly due to the dodgy controls and eye straining style. This also gets my "Bad port" stamp of disapproval.","November 22, 2012","false","5.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Sort of a combination of Borderlands and Fallout without being as good as either. But still good. And fun to play. No, it isn't an open-world game. No, it doesn't have an RPG skill tree. No, there aren't any twists in the story line. A lot of people have criticized the "lack" of story element. But, let's face it, the story is as plausible and complicated as 97.53% of what is out there. I guess it doesn't have a cheesy, "No! My [best friend, father, girlfriend, etc] died!" scene, so some people don't think it is deep. Ah, well.\n\nIt worked great on my computer. The movement was tight and accurate.

Really? Come on Id, you've a long list of weak finales (quake, quake2,doom3 was better though) but this is probably the weakest.\n\nOk. Cons list done. Apart from that, Rage is probably a MASTERPIECE. You start being an old-era apocalypse survivor and, before you have enough time to understand what's happening you're diving in a BEAUTIFUL post-apocalyptic HUGE scenario. A world, so various that goes from broken highways to dead cities, filthy sewers and many many more.\n\nGraphics, The detail is UNBELIEVABLE, every single aspect of every map is placed carefully and planned deeply. You can almost smell the garbage in wasted garage or gasoline in Shrouded Bunker. It's awesome how level designers pay attention to every single insignificant detail. Beautiful. I didn't see any popping artifacts, I must say, Probably because my video card is very old engine just decides to use low texture by default (most of all in Dead City level apparently), which it's ok for me.\n\nGameplay, It's id, come on, Obviously the best in town. Every shot you fire it seems that really hurts enemies, and their bodies react with damage + previous movement so it really seems that a running mutant, coming after you, after been shot to death, has still some inertia to die in front of you making two more steps. This is art, imo.\nI noticed they add a little "RPG" addition, like the possibility to buy / sell items and to create objects from blueprints but developers decided that, very wisely imo, this is an FPS and has to remain an FPS, so this is the only "non FPS" insertion they added.\n\nEnvironment. Various, huge, well detailed. East and west waste land differ very much one from the other.\n\nOpen Word. The entire game level is open, sure. But, during missions, you've the sensation that there's only one way to finish the mission and one way to follow to reach the end of the level but, it's done so beautifully that imo is a pro and not a con.\n\nSummary. I really don't see a reason why not to buy (maybe in sale if it's possible) this masterpiece from ID Software. If new Doom will be at least 40% good as Rage, it will be awesome!!\n","January 8","true","21.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

While it may not be as open as some other FPS/RPG games out there it does bring a few good things to the table that others do not have.  The enemy models, animations and reaction are very well done, fluid and depending on which faction you're fighting against it might play out differently.  NPC interactions are good, and facial animations are very well done making them feel organic at times.  The story is a bit rough in places and if you've read anything about this game you will already know that the ending is well not great to say the least.  While I do wish there was more to the game then what is offered it was mostly fun while it lasted.  The tech in the game world is very nice and refreshing; the in game crafting is rather well done and very quick allowing you to use different items against different enemy types.\n\nThe game could have been better, defiantly, the story could have been a bit better and my god the texture pop in is the worst I have ever seen in my life, however it may not have entirely been iD’s fault based on what I’ve read.  Even on current gen systems you will at times get odd FPS loss and major screen tearing and if you have an ATI card you might want to look else where because I have read that people are STILL having trouble running this game.\n\nIf you can buy/find it on sale like I did when I got it, it’s well worth the money, especially once you tinker with the game engine to make it look/run a little better.  It’s far better then anything Gearbox has done to date I can honestly say that, it’s not a boring motionless world with singular friendly/peaceful NPCs, however it is no Fallout 3, it is very much in between, far better gun play then FO3 for sure however.","September 22, 2014","true","35.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

BORING UNEVENTFUL STORY.\n\nI actively wished the entire game to have a CHOICE in ANYTHING, especially being able to side with the so-called 'authority' because they got cool armor and seemed to have some sembelance of an idea what the hell they were doing.\n\nI do not recommend this game for someone who wants:\n1) A good storyline with a thorough ending.\n2) Interesting characters you can interact with\n3) An open world\n\nAdditionally, if you DO NOT want the following; beware:\n1) Racing is REQUIRED in the main storyline. (I do okay in racing games and was able to complete them, but I do not like them)\n2) a couple mini bosses but no real skill requirement to fight anything\n3) Endless random vendor trash to sell for no apparent reason.\n4) Endless ammo if you so choose.\n5) Enemies which while having some intelligence, still seem to put their back to you when you throw a grenade at them. (seriously, just watched 2 people run around cover and turn to face the grenade with me looking at them... smart.)\n6) A lack of 'fun guns' to play with. Ultimately, I ended up using the shotgun almost the entire game because using 'Pop Rockets' (grenade ammo) is simply the only weapon I found enjoyable, side for shooting mutants with an assault rifle and then slamming them in the face with melee. (other than this, wingsticks were my only other weapon choice)\n\n-Some BACKGROUND:\nI played RAGE originally back in 2012 and after getting bored with it, I stopped playing. This was after about 2 hours of the game and I had not completed the game.\n\nThen, again in 2014 I picked up the game again (figuratively) and played past the part I stopped at previously. Again, I became bored out of my mind and uninstalled it.\nFinally, in 2016 I finished it.\n\nYes, I was bored with an id game. Three times now. I only beat the game to prove I could and... dear god it was still a waste of my time. (Surprisingly, yes I always enjoyed Doom 1,2 and 3, also played the original wolfenstein games and commander keen. So, I love id and I think they have a great staff.)\n\nSadly, this game has dissappointed me greatly. When I first picked it up, read the cover and thought back to the trailers; I said "My, this would rock if it's anything like what is described." That is simply not the case.\n\nI was hopeful of a Fallout3/NewVegas with a doom atmosphere, because out of everything I want a survival horror wasteland game if I can get one. (Even if doom is a bit shooty ;-)\n\nRegardless, this game at first tries to fool you. It gives you quests, loot drops, corpses to desecrate and thereby steal gear from; but ultimately none of it matters. On top of all this; characters all spew dialog for long enough to make me decide to step away from my desk to grab a snack while they yammer, before I can actually get a quest or shop from them.\n\nIf you want to jump into a shooter and just blow people and mutants up, it can be fun. I won't deny that. But ultimately, I have stopped playing it two other times because some areas are just so unbelievably boring.\n\n\nA final thought, the higher you crank the difficulty the higher enemy HP is. (very annoying as that is the only noticable difference)","May 29","false","22.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I definitely have a good feel for the features and style of the game, and while I've selected yes - I do recommend the game - that comes with several important caveats.\n\niD have created a shooter with some really interesting ideas in RAGE. Unfortunately, it suffers from a stunning lack of ideas in many important respects, also - most of which have to do with the actual playing of the game. It's very old fashioned, in many ways, which you may view as a good thing if you're nostalgic for FPS games of old. Weapons assigned to number buttons, 1-10? Check. Unlock them in sequence, just as they're needed? Check. Tight corridors and fast enemies for shotgun splooshing? Check. Open spaces and cover loving baddies for sniper or machine gun play? Check. Oh, and here's a crossbow. Because crossbow.\n\nThe enemies, while spouting some interesting dialogue, are of very limited variety, models reused with alarming frequency. Likewise, their move sets are limited. The challenge arises here in presenting you with more enemies, or sometimes enemies with higher hit points, than in providing smarter baddies. I can't think of a single interesting villian - or hero, for that matter - in the game so far. The characters are massively cliché. Attempts at making the world intimidating, or even horrifying in terms of things you see in bandit camps, are immediately undone by slapstick bad guys with cartoonish animation. Also, it's always jarring to be lectured endlessly about the dangers of this horrifying world, how every step outside the secure towns is taking your life in your hands as hordes of unspeakable monstrosities await the frothy goodness of your very blood...and then to saunter from place to place on a quad bike or stupidly heavily armed buggy without so much as an insult shouted from a nearby hillock. RAGE is not a dangerous world. Glasgow pubs are, literally and figuratively, more dangerous than RAGE.\n\nThis is a game with too many ideas, some of which conflict stylistically with each other. And despite, or perhaps because of, the implementation of these ideas, other things are just left to the side. The world is very small, with some areas getting reused numerous times, just filled with different baddies. There's no true free roaming, in that you follow a limited set of canyons to a few major hubs. Occasionally you blow up a dam, or other obstruction, to unlock new canyons and a new hub. Quests are just places to go and collect things, with set pieces all along the way. A little bit on rails for a modern shooter.\n\nRAGE also features an incredibly annoying set of outdated features which aren't directly related to the gameplay. ALL the button prompts are for xBox controllers, even if one isn't hooked up. I know it's a console port, but that's just lazy and off-putting, and the mapping for controls is far from explicit about what the assigned key will do. The game actually prompts you to save on some occasions (only seen this in DLC missions so far, to be fair), stating that "The action is about to HOT up, better save". Any immersion you managed to achieve in this game, you just shattered with one pop-up. It may sound like griping, but the menu is just plain silly. Select quit game...get the "Are you sure" message. Select yes...get dumped to the opening splash screen, prompted to press enter. Press enter, get the main menu. Select quit game, and...get the are you sure window *again*.\n\nThe game also features something worth special mention: The Most Pointless Weapon Upgrade Ever. Yes, the MPWUE can be found right here in RAGE! An otherwise neat little gun, the Authority LMG, features an optic with decent magnification, good accuracy, large magazines, and an armour piercing ammo variety. It's a staple, and it comes in very handy. And you can buy a laser pointer for it. Now this would be fairly useless anyway, as the shotgun takes care of anything short range and for long range - duh, optic. But the laser beam actually fades away within a few virtual inches of the gun. Even if you stand beside a wall, you realise it's just "painted on" - no red dot ever appears. And, and - there's an aiming reticule anyway! Granted, I've never tried disabling it. Maybe you can. Even so, this somewhat expensive upgrade feels like a lot of ideas in this game: it doesn't matter whether it WORKS, we just think it's cool.\n\nSo why would I recommend RAGE? The vehicle combat between hubs actually feels pretty good. They got the feel and speed very nearly perfect. The weapons, while outlandish and old school, are very fun, especially the alternative ammunition types. Some of the town characters are kind of fun - Kvasir is a favourite, with the little cute robot head on his shoulder nodding or shaking its head along with his conversation. The crafting aspect is pretty well implemented without being intrusive. The little turrets, sentry bots, RC bomb cars and so on, are all fun to scavenge for and use. The areas you go to for missions - should have mentioned, they load up when you enter, they're not part of the open canyons directly - are well laid out, though the path is fairly linear. A little exploration is rewarded with spare parts and such.\n\nRAGE kinda sorta tries to be a more action oriented Fallout, but falls way short of the depth and story of that remarkable world. It also tries to be a single player Borderlands, a bit, and that's just absurd. A showcase of great ideas pinned on an ungainly donkey, pick it up cheap, laugh at its absurdity, enjoy smooshing mutants with an arsenal of stuff...but don't expect awe or major adrenaline rushes, nor a deep, post apocalyptic experience.","January 27, 2015","true","21.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

You can also be a race driver with your very own cars.\n\nPro:\nThe combat system is excellent (these guys made the Doom series..), and I must mention, that the enemy death and combat  animations are exemplary. If I shoot somebody in the stomach, he falls to the ground, then drags himself to the nearest cover, and prepares to die. But he's still alive, so until then, shoots some bullet at you. If I hit somebody's feet, it limps, like in reality. You can be an engineer and construct items such as sentry bots and turrets. These bots are overpowered in my opinion, you can spawn 2 at the same time, and they clear the area for you. The races are exciting, but won the first place always at the first try. The minigames are also cool. Never facede any bugs (fell off the map once, but it was my fault).\n\nContra:\nHowever, you can't really jump. Apart from the race fields, the whole game is very linear. You go into a building through the front door,  kick some ♥♥♥ inside, then return to that door again. And almost every single mission is like this.  The characters are boring, but their mimics and gestures are detailed. The textures sometimes look correct, but when they don't, they're ugly and low detailed. You have to save manually, because the game saves only at the beginning and the end of the mission. Forgot that when I started, and had to start again a mission.\n\nThis game offers much more then 25 hours of content, in overall, it's a great FPS.

So I wanted to write a review, to try to give a comprehensive list of the pros/cons of that game.\n\nFirst of all, this game is NOT a Role Playing Game. Of course, like every single game, it can fit into its definition, since you play the role of a character in an imaginary world. Now, it is not what is conventionally accepted as a RPG. This game has no character levels, it has no skills, it has no skill-tree either of course, and so on.\n\nThis game is a shooter. By the people who invented the genre, id Software. Now, if it is from the people who invented the genre, how can it only have a User Score of "49" (at the time of writing) on metacritic? The reason is simple: this game is really different from what id Software usually does (or did. I did not play, by far, all the id Software shooters; but I played Doom and Quake).\n\nSo, what are the pros and the cons?\n\nPros:\n\nThe overall experience is rather original, refreshing, with a definitely solid and consistent shooter feeling (think of other id Software games, the weapon handling is really close to that). The id Tech 5 graphical engine is incredibly slick, does a wonderful job, and even if the textures are sometimes ugly, or even horrible, when inspected from up close; the game has really neat graphics.\nIn addition, the world, even if not so deep (remember, this is by no mean a RPG), has some interesting aspects, and the artists did an unbelievable job making each part of it unique and authentic.\n\nCons:\n\nid Software used to do PC games. For a company that pretty much invented the FPS genre, it was perfectly logical. Whereas I can understand why publishers decide to make every single game available on consoles, it still is a mystery for me when developers also take that direction. Not for all games, of course, Mario and Sonic were totally fitting for consoles, and so were many arcade games I played as a kid.\nBut for FPSes, one can only wonder. I know that the fingers are probably the most precise appendices we have, but even; how can someone imagine to replace two hands with five and three fingers (for the keyboard and the mouse respectively), plus one arm (the mouse movement has more amplitude, and therefore, more precision, than a stick) by only four fingers (thumbnails and indexes), for the same result?\nAnd even if id Software managed (thanks to their extensive experience?) not to get the main gameplay cluttered by such a decision, ALL the rest of the game has been affected. Not only the interfaces.\nAnd the game also features some mandatory races, there are achievements for random games (random achievements? what's next, unobtainable achievements?), and trying to 100% the game will be an incredibly frustrating experience, for those reasons.\nIt's also worth mentioning that the difficulty is somewhat low (that goes with the "console" aspect I presume: the game has to be accessible to as many people as possible), or at best inconsistent (the Scorchers DLC increased the difficulty a bit, but also gives the nail gun, which has an unlimited ammo (rebar) and a rail gun mode, allowing to see the enemies in advance, and even to kill them without exposing yourself), even in ultra nightmare (which is turning the game into a binary experience (who shoots first) rather than into a harder one), and that in spite of the obvious efforts to make the game as non-linear as possible; all the missions are constructed with the scheme: talk to X, go to Y, kill all the baddies along the way.\n\nBottom line:\n\nThe game still is worth some money, as it has a strong shooter feeling, various encounters, an awesome atmosphere. But don't expect the usual id Software FPS, it is not.\n\nAdditional Note:\n\nI got an "Anarchy edition" (the pre-order bonus) key in order to get all the additional content. I would recommend to do the same, or at least, to unlock the pre-order content (there is a console command for that) when you play the game, as it deeply changes the gameplay.","November 29, 2013","true","129.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

As an FPS, it's top notch.  The guns feel great and the enemy AI is fantastic.  Each type of enemy behaves differently and gives you nice variety throughout the game.  When you go out into the open world, the vehicles feel great and combat is solid.  id also did a great job modestly expanding their usual game archetype with driving, missions, and crafting.  And most surprising, the voice acting, sound, and music are top notch.\n\nOn the technology side, it is nothing short of groundbreaking.  It had a rough launch mostly due to driver issues which have since been resolved;  Now everybody can enjoy the entirely hand-painted world (check out my screenshots).  Of course the downside is, since every texture is unique, things don't look so great close-up.  But I choose to enjoy the game rather than look for faults and it's just amazing my computer can crank out 60 fps when it looks so good.\n\nJust don't expect a fantastic story.\n\nI'd also like to add how impressed I am with the DLC.  It costs $5 and has more content than most $10 DLCs while maintaining the same high quality as the rest of the game.  id managed to integrate the DLC seamlessly with the rest of the story so you never feel like you're actually playing a DLC.  The only real change is that the DLC content is significantly harder than most of the rest of the game.

The overall feel of this game is like if Borderlands and Fallout 3 had a baby and then dropped it repeatedly on it's head.\nI can't quite put my finger on what it is that I find irritating about the gameplay here, but one of the main things is that it feels like a jumble of ideas, none of which quite fit together fluidly.\n\nVisually this game is a complete mess, which I attributed originally to it being based on a pretty sub-par engine that does not support SLI setups.  Having attempted to replay it on a brand new GTX 980 Ti and still experienced the same issues (blurred, low-def textures, horrendous pop-in issues etc.) I can safely say that it is just a terrible engine.\n\nI know that this game is probably right up a lot of people's street, but it really is not up mine.\n\nPros:\n-Some fun moments with the gunplay/driving\n-Interesting scenery when viewed from a distance!\n\nCons:\n-Terrible engine (with regards to graphical issues)\n-Iffy storyline\n-Parts of it plays like a dumbed mix of the boring elements of Fallout game combined with the same from Borderlands.","January 3","false","21.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","2"

This would seem promising considering this game comes from the creators of two of the best series of all time, but does it really? The answer is no… RAGE falls way short of even being somewhat decent. Here are the reasons I found RAGE to be a complete disappointment and the only rage that came from this experience is the rage that I now have towards id software. Shame because id software was my favorite developer.\n\nAnd just a fyi, my pc is perfectly compatible to play anything you throw at it, Tomb Raider, Bioshock Infinite, Dishonored, Shadow Warrior (2013) and Sniper Elite: Nazi Zombie Army 2 all work on the highest settings without a problem.\n\nFirst of all, the graphics… I’m sure we all have heard the nightmare about the graphics being terrible, but let me be more specific. Long story short, the game wasn’t programmed correctly. For example, when I look at something, it will take a few seconds before the textures load in, then I’ll look somewhere else and those textures do the same thing, then I look back at the first place and those textures have to load BACK in. Please explain the logic in this game, the textures are not supposed to vanish when you look away, they’re supposed to stay there until you are far away or have loaded another map. Aside from this, the textures are a very low quality/low resolution. So even after the textures are loaded 5 seconds after you look at them, they still look ugly anyway. I have seen various solutions to fix all of this, and none of them have worked; although the game should be programmed correctly so you don’t even have to waste your time on this. Is it really too much to ask for? All we want is a game that we can load up and be ready to play, we don’t want to spent 2 hours trying various solutions just to get the stupid game to work. Then to top all this off, considering there so many problems with textures popping in, we are also given the worst problem of all… lag. As I said before, my pc has more than enough power to run this game. I can play Bioshock Infinite and Tomb Raider on the highest settings with no problem, but I can’t play RAGE (a game that’s 2 years older) on even the lowest settings. So good job id software, I’m sure you’re very proud of yourselves; you successfully created a game that is nearly unplayable.\n\nSo aside from the game looking like something you found in the back of the refrigerator from 3 months ago, and the game running like a truck with cement tires…. that are shaped like squares, maybe the actually game play will be fun?…… Who am I kidding, they can’t even get the game to run properly, why on earth would the actual game be fun? I will admit, the first 2 hours were certainly fun, brought back memories of the classic id software games, just with horrible graphics. But then after the 2 hours of the fun shooting/exploring/collecting, it decides to take a rather stupid turn in events. First of all, the entire aspect of driving just literally killed the game. I didn’t come here to drive a buggy that explodes every 5 min and am forced to upgrade and waste all the money I just spent 4 hours collecting. If id software wanted to make a driving game, then they should of made a driving game. There is a reason we have different genre’s of games, not so that we can take each genre and awkwardly merge them together that does nothing but fills you with rage *cough cough* So aside from the stupid driving/vehicle upgrade monstrosity, ok lets go shoot things! “NO TO HELL WITH THAT” says id software, “HOW ABOUT YOU GO DELIVER MAIL INSDEAD!” yes this is correct, after 3 hours, the shooting completely stops and you find yourself delivering mail and doing other completely stupid/boring/uneventful tasks. After many hours I had absolutely no use for my weapons and the game didn’t even let me carry them (I guess they disappeared to Narnia) Long story short; the game play sucks, it’s probably better to just replay the first 2 hours a few times then go buy another game.\n\nSo what’s left? Oh, yes, the story….. *falls on the ground laughing* yea there’s absolutely no reason to even talk about that.\n\nSo taking everything into consideration, we have a game that wasn’t programmed correctly, stupid graphics, stupid game play, horrible merging of two completely different genre’s and little to no story. 1/10\n","January 21, 2014","false","6.3"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","4"

Other than that, there's no skills to upgrade, no armor to buy (although you get upgrades for your armor at pre-determined points in the game), and your weaponry is mostly given to you as quest rewards (or during your exploits).\n\nI can't say that I personally like it all that much, but to those who enjoy a good shoot-'em-up with that Fallout-vibe of a post-apocalyptic world, this could be a great way to pass the time.","December 3, 2014","false","7.8"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","0"

The only problem is that Borderlands and Fallout 3 did it first. Indeed while playing Rage it feels just like playing Borderlands without cel shaded graphics and the humor.\n\nThe lack of humor is what startled me with Rage. All the character are stock action movie grizzled veterans, the plot is extremely generic, almost everything about it is treated like the characters are incapable of laughing at their ridiculous situation.\n\nThere are good things about it, I mean the gunplay is alright and the maps are spectacularly detailed. But all the maps are tediously linear and while there are reasons to backtrack through them, you wouldn't want to. That's not even mentioning the technical problems with the game's engine, many of which still exist and have yet to be patched out\n\nI question why this game was made and why Id would stoop so low to just make a more generic Borderlands with Call of Duty elements. One that feels like nobody put any time or attention into detail and just surgically inserted elements because they thought it would sell better.","November 10, 2013","false","1.3"," 14 of 27 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","14","27","0","3"

Through the first half of the game it seems really great and you wonder where it can go from here. Then it gets cliche'y where you "join the resistance to fight the man blah blah blah and how you are a special person that the Authority wants for some reason."\n\nThe last mission was as anti climactic as dinner with my parents.\n\nA nice pro though is that the gunplay is pretty fun for a while but it does start to get a litle repetitive.

But there is some things that just irritates me about it. Let's start of with what I dislike.\n\nNegative:\n*You do not have an in-game town/world map, kind of sucks cause I'm one of those guys who likes to explore everything and check off certain areas as "done" with memorizing the areas through world map. On the other hand the game seem to be so linear that you don't need one.\n\n*The jump seems worthless, there are obstacles in the game that's not even up to your knees that you can't jump across, which makes me think "why did they even give you the option to use jump at all?". You can't even climb over desks, or big windows with stuff in it, you have to get a lock grinder or whatever it's called to blow up the door. That's so poor.\n\n*A headshot with the crappy pistol doesn't kill the enemy, not even 1 feet away. A bullet through the skull on a human being should kill him. (And no, I do not mean the guys with helmets)\n\n*The co-op was a bit dissapointing and really short, I was expecting being able to play full campaign with my brother and not some short missions. Maybe I did my research badly before purchasing the game.\n\n*Using bandages or creating them seem to be quite useless. I mean you do regenerate full health by just not getting shot anwyay and if you badly need a bandage you're probably screwed over anyway cause you need to swap to the bandages from whatever you're currently using, like HE grenades or whatever. A heal button is missed in those scenarios, like pressing "H" on your keyboard.\n\n*The mouse feels bad when you're in the menu, checking inventory, quests and things like that. Feels like it's lagging.\n\n*In combat you can't lean!! I hate that you can't lean and take cover, best you can do is to crouch behind a desk or things a like and just stand up to shoot and then sit again. I think it's rreally poor that you can't lean when your opponents can do all kind of stuff, lean, jump over desks, climb though windows, take their arm up with gun only shooting at you while taking cover.\n\nPostive:\n*The vehicles looks good and are fun to drive.\n\n*The FPS is overall nice, except you can't lean!\n\n*The enviroments and graphics are okay for being a couple of years old game, don't see why people complain over it really.\n\n*The enemies move good and make up for the lack of leaning.\n\n*Quests are OK.\n\nOverall, there is more negative things to say about the game then positive.\nI would recommend this game at a low price on sale, but no chance of getting it at it's full price, there for I do NOT recommend buying this game. It kills some time sure, but if you're out after a good fps game, spend your money on something else.\n\n\n","October 3, 2014","false","27.9"," 19 of 37 people (51%) found this review helpful","51","19","37","0","0"

The term "one clip, one kill" applies here, as mobs which aren't mutants will require a full magazine pumped into them to take them down. It takes a minimum of two head shots from the sniper rifle, which is just a forced waste of ammo. One human enemy in white armor took 3 and 1/2 magazines of ammo to drop, and that was at 5 paces using short controlled bursts so no bullets missed. It was not a boss, but just a trash mob bad guy.\n\nGraphics.\nI keep seeing people praising the graphics of this game, but cannot see why. I got it shortly after it was released, and even then it was sub par compared to other titles. Sure, outdoor scenes can look quite picturesque overall, but the moment you get near any items, their mediocre look really shows. It's as if, even when on the highest graphics settings, that Mipmap number 2 is being used. Some items in the game haven't even been properly UVW mapped, so they just have distorted, splotchy pixels on them. I feel this is a symptom of iD being bought out by Bethesda. Several of us had been discussing whether Bethesda would bring iD down, or iD would bring Bethesda up back when iD was acquired. Unfortunately, Bethesda won, and iD's quality has suffered.\nMaybe it's due to the game being a port, but that is just breaking the 8th commandment of good game development and not an excuse for releasing a bad looking game on the PC.\n\nGameplay and AI.\nThe game handles like your average iD game. Mouse wheel through some of the guns (have to hit the numbers on the keyboard to access the rest), shoot spamming mobs of respawning bad guys, run out of ammo and punch the rest to death while strafing backward. Grab quest item and repeat. The formula worked better in the original Doom.\nThe AI seems like it wants to work, but frequently just starts bouncing bad guys around until you Whack-A-Mole them to death one or two bullets at a time. After an hour in game, it becomes apparent that the AI is sorely lacking, and the game becomes painfully redundant and predictable. Maybe I just played too many iD titles over the decades.\n\nIf you like redundant rail shooters with mediocre graphics, AI and love spamming hordes coming and going, then grab this game. If you want any kind of sophistication or thought provoking gameplay, avoid it like the plague.\n\nAfter thought.\niD attempted to include aspects of all types of genres, and did manage to mix them together well. They even included card games. So you have rail shooter, racing/demolition derby, platformer/killhouse, Magic cards all in one game. I don't play Magic or Borderlands because I don't like Magic or Borderlands. I bought Rage because I thought I was getting another Doom style experience according to their hype.

From the feeling that its a tech demo first and a half hearted entry into a new franchise second, this game is one of missed opportunities and shows how far behind the competition id Software has gotten when it comes to designing memorable experiences. Blurry textures and pop in are a small price to pay when you realize how beautiful and revolutionary MegaTexture streaming actually is from a technical standpoint. On the artistic front there's some truly standout character design and setpieces, but again, they're used only as excuses for shooting galleries.\n\nI suspect the lukewarm reception to RAGE stems from people expecting something along the lines of an open-world RPG with idTech behind it: an amazing proposition indeed, but not what this game actually is. It's a punchy shooter with amazing animation (seriously, shoot a bandit and watch him dance) with the smallest concessions to RPG design, paired with a surprisingly robust vehicular combat component. The plot is shockingly thin, unresolved and downright lazy towards the final act. The game does more of its world building through visual shorthand rather than exposition, and its cliched post-apocalypse is better at conveying pixels and polygons than real heart and soul.\n\nYou'd never mistake this for Borderlands or Fallout, and while it lacks the variety and breadth of its distant cousins, it's still very much its own experience, and one that's worth playing through at least once (and probably only once).","January 8, 2014","true","5.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It is the next generic post-apocolypse shooter. It's like the sampler appetizer that has just a little bit of pieces of other games. However, this is the best looking of these games. Some of the textures look like total crap, but some areas and vistas look very nice. The game does take a lot of hard drive space for a fairly short game. Overall, it wasn't bad. It took around 13 hours to finish. The story is generic. Most of the combat is done in linear corriders. I didn't care for the hit detection when shooting enemies. Shoot them once and you gotta wait to shoot them again or the hit won't register. A lot of bullets and time were wasted having to wait through the AI recovery  god frame animations so the next bullet will register. Most of the exploration is done with vehicles that let you travel the map. I'd recommend getting Rage if it's on sale and you want some mindless fun. It is unremarkable in every way, but I still managed to have some fun with it.","July 18, 2013","true","16.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The game does look great, but there are so many technical issues that prevented me from truly enjoying it. The fact that V-sync, at first, wasn't implemented was a bad choice. The texture pop-in was awful as well. Combine this with the freezing problem (every few minutes the game freezes for at least 1-2 seconds) and I'm sure you'll understand what I mean.\nThe gameplay itself is like any other shooter. With some added RPG elements. You'll  collect a lot of worthless junk (which is a shame) and complete simple, sometimes fun, quests. But since there is no real reward for the sidequests there isn't much incentive to do them at all. You'll gain money and some licenses for your vehicle, but no weapons, schematics or anything else. Not even XP. So in the end there's no feeling you're getting any stronger. A missed opportunity.\nThe driving segments are actually ok, but quite easy.\nAnyway, I did have fun with it, but I expected more to be honest.\n\n[Rating: 81/100]","October 13, 2011","true","13.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The game just doesn't have any character at all. Did you ever watch the series Tru Calling? Well the game-play strongly reminds me of that series. You would have to watch the series to know why. And if I sound harsh, well, yes I am, but I expected much better from the company that pretty much invented the FPS game genre.\nRecommended? No, I am afraid not. I guess when it's in the sales, then OK, but in the mean time buy Borderlands instead.","September 15, 2012","false","3.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/issyloaded/recommended/9200/","issyloaded","IssyLoaded","http://steamcommunity.com/id/issyloaded/","153 products in account","Deeply disappointed. I had been very excited about a new game from ID. It was Doom that had dragged me into the video game world (and ruined my university days) and another game that could distract me from how much my life sucked seemed impossible to say no to. Well, except that I was broke...because my life sucked. Then I found it on sale and had to have it! And I opened it knowing I would love it. Except I didn't.\n\nThe first thing I ran into was how unappealing  NPC characters were  (though Goodman wasn't TOO bad), or even outright creapy (but not in the good way, but in the "hide your children way"). The interaction with the the NPCs is very limited and two-dimentional. Although it does have  the benifit of limiting the amount of time you have to spend with the creapy ones... There was a little eye candy (Marry me, Jani!), but not like you are getting personal time with them.\n\nThe bad guys are also disappointing. I swear, one of the groups (the guys with the remote control exploding toy cars) was a perfect rip off of the bad guys from game Fear. The exact dialog and voices. I can only hope it was done ironically. The other bad guy groups are neary as bed. One group sounds the they are auditioning for the Grumpy Bears (Care Bear's mortal enemies), and one group sounds like "bad russian stereotype". The battle models are nice but still predictable, fine, but it is difficult to take seriously when your killing what sounds like an ogre that was eaten by a teddy bear, or that cartoon Boris character. You want to have faith in the fantasy, but you just can't.\n\nThe guns are not bad, but "select one of 4" for a quick scroll through is stupid. Actually most of the "self" interface is a disaster. And where the hell is the health bar??? If you see "red" you are almost dead? Was that the plan?? Granted scrounging for health packs is so 1992 (when I was failing university), but it did give some purpose to all the wandering around. Hide and you heal? Right...nanites. Just don't get shot with something too big or too often. Granted, the whole thing did work for Call of Duty pretty good so maybe I shouldn't judge that one.\n\nNext, the cars are a pain is the ♥♥♥ to drive, and the game leans heavily on their use. Not only do you need to use them for transportation to missions across the waste lands (fair enough) and engage in combat on the way their (rip off Mad Max much, but that is alright too), but the game forces you to constantly upgrade your car by doing these frustrating off-story racing missions. The vehicle controls are so bad that instead of hours of fun, it was hours of screaming (literally) frustration. My carpal tunnel stress made my teen years look like a knitting class. In terms of game benefit, there is none; in no way does it push the story along. And the race tracks are the same space as the road warrior-ing. You could say irony, but to me it says the producers were to lazy/cheap to program more space, or to add more to the story. Driving itself is the complaint, or my skill at it; I had just finished Borderlands 2 and Far Cry 2, and there is HJGE driving in both, but those two games didn't have me on the edge of rage-quit (no pun intended) every time I got behind the wheel.\n\nThe most frustrating thing was the narrow path that the levels follow. The driving sucked but the play space is extremely limited. With the current focus in gaming being giant sandbox worlds, not being able to climb a rock thats knee high, or jump a waist high railing seems kinda silly. Far Cry 2 has you wandering all over the place, looking for new angles on a problem or for monetary resources. Borderlands 2 does the same (A). The Rage developers create a rather nice (or nasty) world that you want to go look at up close, but they keep you locked on a tight path leading from A to B, and thats it. And there were some REALLY cool scenery, with the classic ID giant biomass...gunk...whatever the hell that was about. They never explained it but it was attention grabbing.\n\nAnd how many games can you rip off at one time? Fallout? With Arks and post-apocolyptic cities and mutants and waste land bandits and picking up trash to sell to buy bullets? And an empty bottle is worth money but no one has stripped the vending machines for parts or food preservation systems? And no one has thought to take the pre-disaster money out of it yet either? Oh, right, its a video game and internal consistancy is optional. What other games was there...Oh yeah, all that spreading alien biomass, line Doom. Well it is ID software so, why not. And Bethesda so sure, nobody to claim copyright infringement. But the lack of originality is a disappointment for the people playing. When you go "hey, its just like Fallout", that should be an indication that you are lacking in creativity. And the voices from Fear? This doesn't inspire...I will give the credit for the conspiracy with Apophis though. Not original, but at least its timely.\n\nIn all, I would NOT recommend this game to anyone. Panic firefights, yes, but too much unnecessary frustration and mood  breaking faults. I give it a >D< for Disappointing. And I bought it on sale!\n\nI will say thanks for the Shotgun. I can never have enough shotgun...And also for Jani, Friday and Destinee...but don't tell my girlfriend.\n\n0)","January 29, 2014","false","38.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It is the next generic post-apocolypse shooter. It's like the sampler appetizer that has just a little bit of pieces of other games. However, this is the best looking of these games. Some of the textures look like total crap, but some areas and vistas look very nice. The game does take a lot of hard drive space for a fairly short game. Overall, it wasn't bad. It took around 13 hours to finish. The story is generic. Most of the combat is done in linear corriders. I didn't care for the hit detection when shooting enemies. Shoot them once and you gotta wait to shoot them again or the hit won't register. A lot of bullets and time were wasted having to wait through the AI recovery  god frame animations so the next bullet will register. Most of the exploration is done with vehicles that let you travel the map. I'd recommend getting Rage if it's on sale and you want some mindless fun. It is unremarkable in every way, but I still managed to have some fun with it.","July 18, 2013","true","16.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It does implement RPG elements in the vehicle and gun categories - allowing you to upgrade and customize your guns and vehicle the way you want to play. Each unique gun has multiple types of ammunition to kill mutants with, and the vehicle comes with many different options such as turrets, mines and rocket launchers. The game is somewhat "open world", but in a linear fashion - i.e., there are only so many places you can go and the canyons between factions usually provide more of a driving segment than a trek on foot. That being said it is still a big game with plenty to explore and take in.\n\nThe Wasteland is home to many factions, such as:\n\nRESISTANCE - A group of people who seek to destroy the Authority's power over the Wasteland.\n\nAUTHORITY- A highly organized and weaponized military force that controls and shapes the Wasteland how they see fit. Unlike the mutants and bandits that wander the Wasteland, the Authority knows what it's doing. They use personal energy shields, recharging stations that refill their energy meters, and utilize cover and tactics.\n\nBANDITS\n\nGearheads - They are the strongest, most intelligent bandit clan in the whole Wasteland, and are best at using heavy machinery and producing energy. They are heavily armored and have the second strongest Minigun soldier. Their combat preference centers around explosives and robotics, making extensive use of Sentry Bots and Turrets.\n\nGhosts - An insane group of cannibals whose dwellings and vehicles are littered with decorative skulls and blood smears as signs of their victories in the Wasteland. They are very agile, maneuvering around the environment with ease performing jumps and other tricks to disorient enemies. They prefer close-in, hand-to-hand combat, making use of Wingsticks and bladed weapons like sickles and kitchen knives. They also sometimes use pistols and assault rifles.\n\nJackal Clan - They're the second most powerful clan, bested only by the Gearheads in manpower. Being agile and tenacious of life, they wear minimal armor and are armed mainly with improvised hand weapons and crossbows. They also use a unique explosive called the Balloon Bomb. They howl and yip, using the the canyon walls to amplify the echos of their shouts and make intruders think that there are more of them in any one spot than there really are. They surprise and swarm their foes, rushing in groups of up to six at a time.\n\nScorchers -  Much like the Ghosts in the way they use environment to their advantage, but they aren't cannibals. They use improvised hand weapons, including spiked baseball bats, as well as firearms and grenades. They worship the Apophis asteroid as a God and decorate themselves, their vehicles and their residences with images of fire and destruction. They're masters of ambush, hunting in packs and surprising their victims in the most unlikely places.\n\nShrouded Clan - They are the most technologically advanced and intelligent Bandit Clan in the Northern Wasteland, and also strong enemies. They tend to use assault rifles and grenades, and use cover frequently.\n\nWasted Clan - A group of British-accented bandits with gung-ho mentality, which means they will suicidally charge at you. They prefer hand weapons, explosives, firearms and are particularly adept at vehicular combat.\n\n\n9/10 Highly Recommended.","December 22, 2014","true","17.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

When it was released, some reviewers couldn't manage to move past the issue of the game's blurry textures found in the game's indoor areas. And the rather abrupt ending was a disappointment to some.\n\nI think this game is brilliant. Even if the indoor area textures are blurry, the "big picture" of each scene is mind-blowingly beautiful. This game's canyon vistas are the most intensely gorgeous I've ever seen, and I include Skyrim in that list. Even the interior scenes, with their gross 1990s textures are are composed and lit with an obvious hand-crafted touch. Graphically, it's a "don't miss the forest for the trees" kind of situation. Make no mistake though, the art direction and craftsmanship in-game is absolutely phenomenal and despite the blurry textures, Rage manages to look better than almost any other game I've played.\n\nThe gameplay is spectacular and highly varied for a shooter. The guns look and sound awesome. The driving and driving combat is great. Racing is fun.  The story is cool. The world is permeated with style. It's like Blade Runner in the west.\n\nDefinitely worth playing.","February 2, 2015","true","70.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I originally played through RAGE on the Xbox 360, but during that playthrough, I only went through the game in a linear fashion. For my second playthrough on the PC, I thought i'd explore the content some more. RAGE starts off with you waking up in an Ark. "Welcome to the future!", the game tells you as you come to realize that the future looks terrible. Turns out, an asteroid had collided with Earth, wiping out nearly every city, or at least all the cities around you. People are still around, but they are from the future, as you are considered to be from the past. RAGE emphazises popularity and community, and with all the enjoyable characters, amazing voice acting and sound design and art design, the game can grab you easily and fit you in with the world to help you understand all the struggles these people are going through. Every character is unique and equally lovable. The world is huge and fun to explore. Tons of side missions can be optionally accepted, which can also lead to new areas you would have never explored before. 4 well hidden easter eggs which are, not only rewarding, but very reminisant (Once you find them, you'll know what i'm talking about). Tons of collectable cards around the entire game which can be used to make some extra cash by playing a game of cards in town, which is actually really fun, despite how simple the game itself looks. The gunplay in RAGE is amazing. There is not a complete plethora of weapons, and I do wish there were more, but what's given to you is great in its own entirety. Upgrades can be purchased and found in side missions as rewards which is a great way to encourage these missions, because the upgrades from side missions, like the auto-sniper upgrade, are really really useful. Every single area you explore is insanely fleshed out and impressive at the same time, thanks to id Tech5, showing off amazing visuals with strong gameplay. One they you may notice about RAGE is how difficulty balances with your items. It's weird, but it works. I played through the game on Normal, which, later in the game, does get pretty difficult. Enemies become a lot tougher. This is where id's genious balancing comes into play. You have 10 bandages and you're fighting against heavily armored bandits. Yes, as you keep getting low on health, you can just hit Q to quickly heal, but as long as you keep getting shot and low on health, you'll quickly use up your bandages, meaning you have to use other things to kill your enemies quickly so they dont deplete your bandages. What goes along with great gunplay? Your choices of ammunition. This is where RAGE becomes so much more fun, trying to play with the different ammo types, seeing what each one does, ranging from Electric Darts to Dynamite Darts to Mind Control Darts, all holding their own unique ability. The mind control darts allow you to take over an enemy and guide them and blow them up, killing them and damagin enemies around them. Electric darts allow you to shock enemies, of course, but also can hit water to shock anyone touching the water. It's all basic stuff, but makes RAGE so much more enjoyable. In RAGE, there is a lot of driving and a lot of combat while driving. New cars can be unlocked in races, which are extremely fun thanks to how much control driving actually has. After winning Race Certificates, you can buy upgrades for your car such as armor or themes. Different cars have different gun limitations, such as the Anarchy Edition Rat Rod, only being able to have one type of gun at a time, while cars like the Monarch allow for all types of weapons on the car at the same time. Bandits in cars can also be killed for extra cash in both sides of the Wasteland. Overall, i'm impressed with how much content is actually in RAGE.\nRAGE is a great game, amazing at best. It does very little to upset me besides the occasional FPS drops and the annoying FOV, but those don't take away from the game's atmoshpere and gameplay. I recommend RAGE to everyone. It's fun, interesting, and a game that encourages all types of play rather than a few, which is done well in every way.","December 3, 2014","true","28.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Reminds me of an early borderlands style world but with more realistic graphics, than the cartoony BL graphics.\nIf you havent played RAGE yet, try it i think it was a great game that needed more and could have been an epic game with sequels.","February 13, 2014","true","23.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Visually it looks great too\n\nFrom what I remember this game was never one that got rave reviews and I just don't know why.\n\nIt's a good looking, enjoyable game and the most important thing is that it is what a game should be. FUN.\n\nIt's quite an old game now meaning you can often pick it up dirt cheap but even at the current price without a sale deal it is well worth getting.

It doesn't prevent you from having fun: a lot of ammo and buffs are provided.\nDevelopers were trying to make the world more vivid and alive but i can't say they succeeded. Still it's FPS not a RPG.\nAnyway, everything about this game was written in other reviews, that's just my two cents.\n\nP.S.

There's basically 2 cities and a garage in the wastes. Some bandits are Brits while others speak with Russian accent etc.\n\nYou fight all enemies in dungeons (old city, factories, sewers) connected by open-world corridor defended by bandit cars that you can either kill for cash or avoid or get killed by. You can visit a total of 5 or so dungeons and then do them again in sidequests. You'll probably forget them anyway. One dungeon is special though as you can revisit it backwards. That one you will remember for life!\n\nIn the free cities you can join offroad races in different modes, most of them spiced by miniguns and rockets. Races earn you points you can spend on vehicle upgrades like thicker armour and wheel spikes.\n\nI don't think multiplayer (racing only) was ever alive in this game on PC and I only tried co-op back at release and it was too laggy.\n\nPros: I really enjoyed shooting. There's only so many weapons but all of them have several different ammo types making shooting even more fun and interesting. It really makes up for other stuff. Voice acting is also decent.\n\n6.5/10 get it on sale\n\nI finally got to finish this thing, and after how many years. The release for this game was bad. It was a disaster plagued by bugs, performance issues and straightup incompatibility with some hardware.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nocturnalizer/recommended/9200/","nocturnalizer","Nocturnalizer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nocturnalizer/","406 products in account","It seems that success was never in Rage's destiny. id Software (known for their genre-defining shooters, Wolfenstein 3D and Doom) released their 2011 open-world shooter in a post-Fallout 3 gaming landscape, choosing to leave their world fairly empty and uneventful aside from car combat encounters. It's testament to id Software's brilliance at making a polished combat system that the many flaws Rage has don't massively detract from the fun you'll have playing through it.\n\nIt's glaringly apparent throughout Rage that much work has gone into the combat. Guns feel great to fire, with multiple modes of fire and different kinds of ammo to suit the varied situations and enemies you'll be encountering. There's a decent selection of them too, with the Combat Shotgun being a particular favourite, as you blast shells into mutants and bandits alike. There's also an Engineering (aka crafting) element, where you combine components to build certain tools. It's quite fun to build Sentry Turrets and deploy them, as well as RC Car Bombs that you can drive into a group of enemies and detonate. You'll quickly find yourself creating bandages to heal up more quickly, and making a ton of Pop Rockets for your shotgun for that extra explosive bang. Simply put, id knows how to do guns and do them right.\n\nAs mentioned before, there's a fair bit of car combat in the game. We've since had games like Mad Max that do this quite a bit better, but here it's not too bad. You get a selection of cars throughout the game, and you can arm those with machine guns and rockets. Most of your encounters will be as you drive from one objective to another, and you can earn money from destroying bandit vehicles and returning to Wellspring or Subway Town for rewards. There's a decent amount of things to do in the game, with races and mini-games, plus the two main towns with their Job Boards that offer side quests.\n\nThe biggest issues with Rage all concern its story and quests. You're mostly looking at a run of fetch quests throughout the game, and everything feels a bit samey. There's a general feeling of "meh" throughout the experience, as you venture into locations (sometimes more than once if you have to go back for a side quest) and dispatch of enemies, then either pick something up to bring back to town or plant something there. This is mostly a game that concerns itself with the fun feeling of shooting things, so in that respect it succeeds, but you'll not be playing this for any interesting or in-depth questlines. It's all going to wash over you, as the story limps to its conclusion. It's clear a sequel was planned, given the rushed, open-ended final cutscene.\n\nOverall, I do recommend Rage. I enjoyed my time with it, because the things that id gets right are the things that tend to matter in their games. You're getting a polished combat system, with plenty of nice guns and tons of enemies to shoot them at. You're even getting a small open-world to enjoy, even though there's not all that much to do in it aside from drive around, shoot other cars and occasionally pop in for a quick match of Bash TV. There's a bit more to do in the towns and those are the activities that will take up much of your time. The quests are the major flaw here, being generally uninteresting and uninspired. Rage is still id's most underrated game, and while its flaws will be apparent to you as you play through it, there's some good, solid stuff here that makes for an enjoyable experience.\n\n","January 26","true","34.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It certainly didn't look bad on screens and reviews weren't that bad either.\nWhat a mistake this was.\n\nThere's some kind of story that isn't that easy to follow as you are too busy being a good dog and fetching stuff for incompetent people who can't drive 500 meters to do it themselves.\n\nThe graphics is okay, but definitely not good. While models look quite pretty and detailed, textures of the environment are blurry and very low-res. There's an option to turn details for textures on, but if you do, FPS goes WAY down and the change isn't even that remarkable.\n\nThe sounds are standard. There's not much to say about them. There's also music that fits the atmosphere, but sadly isn't very memorable.\n\nWhen it comes to gameplay, the game takes some time to get used to. Enemies run around doing parkour stunts, so it's sometimes quite difficult to hit them (in the head). You can also drive vehicles and install weapons on them to be able to defend yourself from bandits who also own vehicles. Driving feels okay as long as you don't race. It's not like the racing is so bad, but AI drivers are masters of rally and you might have a hard time winning the first place. Races in the second part of the game are extremely frustrating.\nWhat kills this game are the minigames. They are mostly based on luck and even if they aren't, the game is ready to ♥♥♥♥ in your mouth anyway. It doesn't help that the game has achievements, which means more frustration for achievement hunters like myself as you MUST win all those unfair minigames. Did the lousy developers really think this was fun?\n\nTo sum it up, this game is pretty much average. It's fine for people who don't go for 100% and avoid all the frustrating stuff the game has to offer. I personally was in rage several times, so at least the bloody title is fitting.\n\nEDIT: Finally did it. What were you thinking, idiots?

If you do not like arcade style play do NOT buy this game!  There are certain sections early on that require arcade play and a must win (Dusty 8 Race) before you can progress any further.  If you can't hammer away at these sections you're done playing the game (which is where I am now).\n\nThe FPS portion of the game is great.  Fun weapons and very challenging.  It is unfortunate that many encounters are proximity triggered so there's not as much sneaking up on the enemy as I personally prefer.  Great for those 'run in and kill' player style folks though.\n\nThe monetary system is a bit of a challenge early on, but as with most games it gets easier.  Some of the side betting games in Wellsprings help.  On the downside, I think there are too many games within the game.  They're nice distractions I guess, but they don't lend to the storyline (as far as I got that is).\n\nThe explorable world is really not all that big.  This is not some large open map, but rather a nicely textured backdrop in which missions are narrowly bracketed into the surrounding landscape.  It takes little to no time to find the outer boundaries of the map in each mission.  No climbing over the boulders, sneaking around, and getting the lay of the land before you proceed around that blind curve... you're just gonna have to proceed.\n\nIn as much as the previous mission areas remain open, creating an ever expanding environment... "vast" hardly describes your gameplay area.\n\nThe flexibility in assigning key controls is good.  I prefer to keep as much as possible on the keypad and the number of commands allows things to fit nicely.  The graphics are beautiful.  The responsiveness in game (on my machine anyway) is great!\n\nI can't recommend the game though.  The game description does not accurately reflect the limitations in play and as I noted previously, there's no clear mention of game stops at arcade style missions much less mention of arcade play at all.  Had I known they existed I would never have purchased the game.\n\nAfter a mixed bag of high enjoyment in FPS and extreme disappointment and frustration in arcade play the game will be unloaded and placed in the virtual trashcan.\n\nThere are those that will greatly enjoy the mix of play.

The shooting mechanics and "feel" of the guns is one of, if not the best I've every played, and I enjoyed the atmosphere, enemies and NPCs. The story was not great but I wasn't expecting it to be. The single biggest detriment to the fun of the game for me was the backtracking, but it only occurs a few times, mostly in sewer tunnels and other indoor environments. Some people like their games to last 100s of hours, but if you are like me and tend to lose interest in games when they get long in the tooth (Borderlands), then you will still be having fun when this game ends, which is a plus.\n\nIf you haven't played this and can get it on sale, and you enjoyed the mechanics of Wolfenstein: New Order, I would highly recommend it.","January 17","true","19.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Now that my PC can actually play this game (not that it couldn't have on it's release) I can write a review! It's a linear world almost presenting itself as open world. The performance issues of the past seem to not exist anymore. Texture pop-in can be annoying if you're looking around too quickly. The story and characters are amusing and it's a shame the game wasn't developed further to make use of them. Oh well!!\n\nRAGE is a good, fun, and relatively easy game to play in my opinion.

Edna Hoover","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197967681844/","270 products in account","This is not a complete dissaproval of the game, but it certainly has some huge flaws which should be considered before buying.\n\nRage is a game of famus studio id Software, which still got much fame credits from Wolfenstein, Doom and Quake (till part 3) but after that failed to develop along with rest.\n\nRage is gameplay wise an old school shooter set in post apocalyptic earth, after a huge asteroid hit earth. The silent protagonist emerges from bunker called "ark" quite some time later. Due to the fact that he got some nanites into his body he is quite an Ubermensch as he starts to kill entire bandit bases not 5 minutes after the beginning, as he immideately gets thrown into the action. This is already quite most of the very thin story.\nGameplay is as already mentioned rather oldschool-shooter like without any coversystem, third person or such things. Also there is a very limited stealth system with weapons like a crossbow, but then again there is no real use in stealth.  A point where Rage does have some moderately modern impact is this pesky autoheal feature, so that after hiding for about 10 seconds you are fully healed a make craftable items like bandages or health booster rather pointless.\n\nCraftable? Yes, you read right. You can loot and buy spare parts and reciepes to construct better ammo, consumables and gadgets like exploding RC cars, sentry turrets and sentry bots. Sounds nice but less useful than you might think.\n\nFor the weapons arsenal: its really standard. Fists, pistol, assault rifle, shotgun, crossbow, sniper rifle, machine gun, rocket launcher and a pulse gun. furthermore (I think via DLC) you get an SMG like nail gun. These guns get also different ammo, like armor piercing, EMP slugs and so on, but nothing to get too exciting over.\n\nFor the world: Rage is promoted as an open world shooter. You get a buggy (which you can exchange for a better one) to drive thorugh some sandy, rocky canyons. There is barely anything to explore. You just drive from you homebase/town to the mission and back. No reason to explore the world. All that happends is that you get randomly attacked by suddenly spawning raider buggys. Quite boring.\n\nThe levels: You think a call of duty had straight forward levels? Well, Rage lets a CoD look like an open worlds RPG like Fallout. You absolutely have zero chance to go the wrong way, as there is no way. Almost everything looks the same. I mean, ok, i get it, it's post apocalyptic but does EVERYTHING to be just in grey and sandy-yellow? Only few levels differ from this style and manage to create some atmosphere. Also the levels design is very cheap. You gun your way through an area, pick up the final item/press the final button and suddenly there is a formerly closed door or a zipline which brings you back the start where you can leave the level. The WORST THING is that each level gets reused in cheap ways, so that you have to revisit a level with a different objective, but relive the level almost the same just reversed. I understand that you reuse game assets, but the way it was done here just looks cheap. The absolute joke is the end of the game. You get what looks like another boring mission, drive from A to B, enter level C. You gun down hordes of stupid enemies, press some buttons and suddenly after 30 secs of video without any speech or the like the game is over.\n\nThe enemies: Some reviews praised the enemy AI. I could not imagine why. Meele types just rush you, maybe dodging once or twice. Ranged enemies stay mostly in cover and throw grenades from time to time. If you get to close they go in to bash you. But there is nothing you haven't seen in 1998's Half Life. Another point is the missing diversity. You shoot you way thorugh dungeons with dozends of the same mutants. Literally the SAME. All in all there are maybe each half a dozend skins for raiders and mutants. But you almost always encounter just one or two and the same time as they are different tribes.\n\nGraphics & sound: Sound is nice. I enjoyed it in 5.1 sourround. Graphics: Rage gets promoted as "Powered by id's revolutionary id Tech 5 technology" with "jaw dropping graphics". This is just a bad joke or marketing lie. NPC skins in the town areas may be quite decent and some shader effects from explosions or energy weapons may look nice, but in generell the graphics were and are mediocre. Especially the world textures look horrible, but smallish indoor levels as well.\n\nPlaytime: I took my time, did all the boring, repeating side missions, did all the boring racings to tune my cars up to max eg, and saw the ending after little more than 20 hours. The most interesting missions and the (by far) most fun boss fight were included in the Scorcherers DLC, so consider buying this if you decide to buy Rage.\n\nSummary: Would I recommend Rage? Well, at least not for 25€ (incl. DLC). You could consider it if there is some like 75% sale and you are looking for a straight forward ego shooter and don't care about story.\nThe game feals like it has much potential but falls very shot. The graphics are way behind the niveau one is used from an id game. Also I got the impression the gyus at id were overwhelmed with a decent story, as their games barely had any in the past. Also it seems like they didn't have had enough time to finish properly, considering the massive resuse of game maps they did.","January 5","false","24.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It's nothing awe inspiring, but it holds its own. The AI seems a little smarter than the norm, as it will allow squads of enemies to work as teams to advance, retreat, or attempt to outflank the player. It has its holes that can be exploited and sometimes does some dumb things, but for the most part provided for satisfying combat.\n\nCar combat can be a little frustrating due to clunky controls. It also seems to serve no point other than a novelty or to disguise the game world to seem more open and exansive. It is mostly a boring affair that wouldn't have been missed if it was not in the game.\n\nThere is an illusion of an open world, but the game areas are actually quite linear. There are many side missions that seem pointless and unrewarding. It probably didn't help that rewards were mysterious and the game is not very forthcoming in communicating what they were. They also tell little about the world you are in. Very thin and bland and could easily be avoided, in favor of sticking with the main mission, without much loss to the experience whatsoever. The game world itself felt rather shallow and it was difficult to relate to or care about anyone or anything within it.\n\nLastly, and probably my biggest gripe, the game just seems to abruptly end in a very anticlimatic fashion. There really wasn't any real main antigonist in the game. You hear rumors and details of the promise of some kind of rival that the player may have to face, but none of it ever comes to fruition. There is never even a single encounter, dialogue, or anything with a supposed main antagonist. The ending of the game lacks any kind of boss encounter at all, even though it leads the player to believe that one should be expected. It's as if the developers ran out of time and resources to flesh out anything the game teases the player with and just abruptly ends. Very lackluster and disappointing, nearly feeling like a waste of time.\n\nOnly get it if you have a serious hankering for a single player FPS and you've played everything better already. Only get it on sale as well. Or better yet, save your time and play something better.","January 4","false","43.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The world is gorgeous, in a post-apocalyptic, Fallout-like style, with some obvious Fallout-like ripoffs.  Still, it's worth it just to experience some of the really immersive visuals.  The characters and people are reasonably good, beautifully crafted, fully voiced with a variety of personalities (even if some of the acting is forced).  Also, the first "Dead City" experience was really memorable.\n\nThe game is largely good, but suffers from a lack of direction and from trying to do & to be too much.  The crafting system is interesting and provides some value, but largely unnecessary to complete the game.  The various minigames, too, are value-added, but in the same way that finding spare change in your pocket is value-added.  The vehicles actually drive very nicely and are enjoyable, and the vehicular combat isn't bad, but the entire racing circuit side-game is virtually mandatory and--as such--is a detriment.\n\nThe game is arguably broken up into three sections, by "hub".  The first and third sections are really short, while the second is probably over-long.  The first section, being short, makes sense.  Its an intro to the game; the starting quest hub.  The brevity of the third hub, however, and the entire third section of the storyline--including the anticlimactic end stage and ending--feels shockingly unfinished, especially compared with some real gems in the section section (Wellspring), most notably the first visit to the Dead City.\n\nUltimately, I'd recommend the game, if only to experience the first half to two-thirds of it.\n","March 22","true","16.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DarkwaveSurfer/recommended/9200/","DarkwaveSurfer","Famanche","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DarkwaveSurfer/","367 products in account","Short summary - I never managed to finish RAGE. (My hours are off, I used to play in offline mode a lot) The art direction was great for the time, and I really felt a sense of an organic world. But the storyline really boiled down to a series of overdone tropes and cliches that really failed to hit home, and the combat seemed gimmicky at times.\n\nThe Wingsticks (boomerang machete frisbees) were pretty cool, but in order to make them viable the game turned down weapon damage considerably - in the very first combat of the game you can shoot a person twice in the face before he dies. With no sort of tactical bent, the game ends up being a circle-strafe kiting fest while you use everything but your primary weapons, which would be fine except the level design doesn't cater towards old school ground-and-pound shooting, and it's often hard to use special attacks in constrained corridors. I got to a point where I was using Armor Piercing ammo in an advanced assault rifle and still had to expend a whole magazine to take a simple Raider guy down, let alone the hyper-advanced enemy stormtroopers. I had to strip their armor off with my initial fusillade and then poke them in the eye with bullets until they collapsed.\n\nSlight spoiler here, but there is a boss fight where you have a gigantic enemy standing above you, slamming down fists in a predictable pattern. You have to strafe back and forth on a small ledge, dodging his attacks, while shooting rockets (that spawn 2 at a time in a crate off to the side) into a painfully obvious weakpoint. We've seen this movie before.\n\nThe racing was enjoyable, considering I rarely play any racing minigames. But it's required for advancement in the plot - you get to your first hubworld, and you are told you need to win X number of races to get enough currency for a better vehicle to progress to the next hubworld. I completed the races, advanced the storyline, ended up in the next hubworld, and was immediately told I needed to complete some slightly different racing circuits in order to get ANOTHER vehicle, with which I could - You know what, I honestly just stopped playing at this point.\n\nOverall, I liked the art style, and the plot promised, at certain points, a wonderful execution of some tried-and-true concepts. But the game fell short, on all counts, and what could've been a pillar of the Post Apocalyptic genre ended up as a derivative, rehashed shooter that I can not recommend, no matter how much I'd like to.\n\nPros:\n-Good art direction/design\n-Good racing segments\n-Interesting special weaponry\n-Promising storyline (a good sense of atmosphere in some sections, hard to replicate)\n\nCons:\n-Cliche and tropeheavy story, no emotional attachment to characters\n-Unsatisfying gunplay\n-Formulaic gameplay progression (go here, do this, race this guy so you can get to the next hub, do it all over again)\n","December 23, 2015","false","9.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"
