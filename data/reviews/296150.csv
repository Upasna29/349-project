When the buggy menu FINALLY lets you join a game (that is, if there are any available), you are dropped into what seems to be a waiting area where you can run around randomly. Then you click the join arena button, where it sends you into the g-ball arena, which is a giant sphere full of random things on the ground and floating rings in the air. That's it. No explanation, no tutorial, nothing. It seems they just expect you to automatically know what to do.\n\nNow, the controls. First, you can't change them in game. Second, the standard setup isn't too bad, but it's unresponsive and hard to figure out. For example, why the hell is the button to throw a ball the right click? To move the camera, you have to hold either mouse button and drag, however it too is unresponsive.\n\nOverall, I think this game really does have potential. The graphics and environments are nice, but everything else needs work. Also, it REALLY needs an instruction guide.","May 30, 2014","false","0.1"," 28 of 35 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","28","35","0","0"

In the year 2035 you are playing in 6 different glass arenas next to the planet Mars. The gameplay reminds me strongly on basketball, of course it's in a zero gravity environment.\nWhat it doesn't make it easier is that if you land on a wall everytime your view begins to roll. Altogether the controls of this game are very inconvenient. You have permanently to  push left mouse button to hold your focus on red ball. You can also use smash balls to disturb your opponent in scoring. But after a while you may get dizzy of these weird camera movements. And then there are these countdowns everywhere. If you score it countdowns, if a new round begins it countdowns, if the game starts it countdowns  and much more of that.\nI know: on NASA rocket launches I always liked the countdowns most...","June 26, 2014","false","3.5"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","79","15","19","3","0"

It is glitchy, the physics sometimes defy logic, and of course the result is a multiplayer game with NO player base.  It's dead.  I begged my gf and she played with me to get the achievements, but in hindsight the only fun was not the game but in making fun of it.  Like watching a really bad movie.  It's so bad it is funny.  If I played this with random players (if there were any) then maybe it would be less fun.\n\nAvoid this game like the plague.

You spawn, you jump and try to get the red ball. Only thing is, you cant, because you miss it by an inch EVERY TIME. Then when omeone has the ball there is no way to get it from them unless you go back to one of the goals and get a thunderball. You miss, then you miss again, and finally after countless tries you score.\n\nNow the controls are amazingly crappy. I can barely control my guy. Its hard af to turn around, and if i get on one of the jump pads below the goals it always knocks me right into them. After knocking into it, I slowly at about .2m/s facing it like im stupid. The game would make a really good lets play, because just about everything that happens makes you want to knock the screen in. The only enjoyable part about it is the taunts, because you can dance thriller and gangam style. Also why is this called astronaut academy if your playing a space sport?

I didnt play it much. The concept is not bad, your part of a team of zeroG footballers the idea seeming to be to pick up one of a couple of ball types and either score or attack a player with. As simple as the game is, it's controles are what REALLY let it down. your mouse only controles looking about as far as i can tell, while w and s control forward and backwards, a and d are turn left and right, but there is a turning circle meaning you turn more like your driving a forklift truck rather than a person, there is strafe but its unresponsive and slow.\n\nThis game needs some serious changes to be any good imo, the main one being the movement, its all just too slow, you cant quick dodge or side step and once airborn you never now whats gunna happen, you could go all the way to the other side of the sphere you play in, or you could just shoot off on  random axis for no given reason.\n\nThe graphics of the game are aso a little odd, the terrain looks decent though dated but the characters are glossy as hell, like they are wearing super shine spandex and the "audience" is a VERY bad bitmap.\n\nAll in all, I dont think this game is a bust, NASA need to really think about what ppl want in a game rather than trying to be inavitive, they just dont have the experiance for it. Do a co-op space survival game, DayZ on the moon kind of thing. Its not unique, but it would sell.\n\nGameplay 3/10\nAudio 5/10\nGraphics 4/10\nOverall Rating 3/10\nThis Game wasn't even worth the money at free, what little time I didn spend on it was just not enjoyable at all.","May 31, 2014","false","0.1"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","10","15","0","0"
