And for the most part, that’s exactly what I got.\n\nSolarix is a sci-fi horror game that is predominantly stealth based with a bit of FPS tacked on. Emphasis on stealth though. You literally cannot go guns blazing in this game as ammo is incredibly scarce. And even if you wanted to, it takes a lot of bullets to kill just one enemy and they are alerted to your presence the moment you shoot them, so good luck even trying.\n\nInstead, you use your guns to shoot out lights to make the sneaky stealthing a lot easier. The stealth for the most part is well designed, combining both noise and sight into its mechanics. It's simple enough to intuitively understand and deep enough to get a good feel out of stalking, circumventing and taking out guards.\n\nHowever, my biggest gripe with the game is its frankly bizarre hitboxes. I don't know how or why, but in the second half of the game, the electro-shocker became incredibly unreliable for taking out guards. I'd stand there blasting away at the back of their heads for ages until I accidently either shoot too high, too low or miss and they'd instantly be alerted to my presence. This made the game so much more difficult than it needed to be and was the cause for about 65% of my deaths. Even wose, sometimes I'd try for ages until saying "screw this" and just shooting them. Other times it'd work perfectly. I am convinced the game randomly decides to make the enemies immune to the electro-shocker for shiggles.\n\nLikewise, even the shotgun lacked a lot of punch and didn't help much when I got caught in a bad situation. Really, your best bet when spotted is to run and hide in a dark corner until the enemy loses sight of you. I guess this works well for the stealth as it discourages you from trying to muscle your way through challenges, but I did not find it enhancing the game in any way.\n\nThe AI for the guards was also quite strange. It was not uncommon to see a guard walk into a doorway or a pile of boxes and get stuck there. Likewise, sometimes if they chased you and then stopped as you got away, they'd get stuck in your path and you'd be unable to progress. Another weird thing they do is that in darkness you can be right up in front of them and they won't notice, but god forbid you move in anything more than a crawl near them or they'll instantly know where you are.\n\nAlso, they appear to be afraid of stairs.\n\nAnother problem that I only really encountered at the beginning of the game was an overabundance of invisible walls. Sure, in some areas it'd robably be a stretch to fit through, but in other places it was a serious immersion breaker to see a large gap that you should by all means be able to fir through.\n\nThe games not all bad though. I gotta say, the voice acting in this game is quite sublime. Characters actually emote and you can really feel the fear in their voices. The lore too is very intricate and filled with all kinds of facets that add extra dimensions to the story. Mind you, sometimes the voices were too distorted or crackly and it became quite difficult to make out what they were saying. The UI is very good and the objective menu for the most part helped me out when I'd be otherwise stuck Graphically, the game looks impressive. Let me tell you, stepping outside the spaceship and into space, I was gobsmacked! The spaceship looked so good!\n\nBut what's a good horror game without a good story right? Ho boy...\n\nThis is without a doubt the most depressing game I have ever played. Basically, you play as Walter, an engineer who wakes up in a ruined base that’s gone to hell. With the help of the AI AMI and the enigmatic Betty, you try and find a cure for the mysterious and deadly infection that is decimating he colony all the while trying to deal with the ever watchful and threatening EYE. Without wishing to spoil too much, Murphy's Law is in full effect. Everything that can go wrong goes wrong. By the end of the game... Yeah. The ending in particular hammers home just how badly things went to hell.\n\nPeople often praise a game for being depressing, as it is an incredibly potent emotional experience. For me though, I can't help but wonder what the point of it all was. At the end of the game, you've basically accomplished nothing. 12 hours I sunk into this game to beat it and coming out of it, I question whether or not it was worth it.\n\nI suppose in a meta sense, this game shines with its oppressive atmosphere. You a far far away from home in an incredibly hostile and haunting environment with nothing but deranged guards and mindless zombies in your wake. And at the end of it all, that atmosphere stays with you as you wonder to yourself what the point of it all is and just how much it all really mattered.\n\nAt the end of it all, I'm really not sure whether I like this game or not. For all the dodgy hitboxes and spotty AI the game had, it also had well-designed environments and lore/story that really got to you both for the emotional gutpunch of an ending and for an interesting experience in futility. I guess I got what I was looking for with more sci-fi horror in space, but I like my games to feel as though I accomplished something. So in the end, I guess I've got a tentative no. If you're looking for a nice depressing story and can stomach the strange guard AI and hitboxes, then this game is for you. But honestly, you really can't appreciate a good depressing story without some happiness and things going right to put the misery into context. If everythings goes wrong, sure that's more fuel for drama, but it gets harder and harder to stay invested if you just know it's not gonna turn out ok. Perhaps I'm wrong and too idealistic, but I get my entertainment from games by seeking a sense of accomplishment. Without that feeling of triumphing over adversity, even if its at a great cost and even if it's not as grand as it should or could have been and EVEN IF it's not or the better that you succeeded, then the game loses its entertainment value to me and I come out of it feeling worse for the wear.","December 9, 2015","false","12.2"," 186 of 223 people (83%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","83","186","223","6","9"

People who compare this game to System Shock, Deus Ex or Dead Space don't know what they're talking about. Solarix is a Science Fiction game with a Cyberpunk & Horror theme, that is where the similarities start and end.\n\nThis is a terrible mix of stealth, FPS and horror where you will spend 90% of the game crouching to avoid near sighted enemies who almost humorously go into an alert state from a single footstep the moment you leave the crouching position.\n\nThere is no customization or character skills, no inventory management and I counted all of 2 jump scares in the entire game. There is a total of 3 weapons, 1 of which is non-lethal and rarely works due to poorly coded hitboxes and the other 2 you're given very little ammo for. Lastly every single objective consists of going here or there, flipping switches and finding access cards.\n\nVisually it looks like something from a decade ago, though maybe this was done ironically? And it is often choppy and stuttering for no apparent reason even on an i7 and 780ti.\n\nI would call this a somewhat polished early access game at best. It supposedly has a length of about 7 or 8 hours, though I finished it in half that time even with numerous restarts due to glitches and bugs. There is a boring storyline here about a virus, engineers, corrupt AI systems, etc, with little to no character development and just on the whole everything feels very sloppy and unpolished.\n\nI can see these guys (the developers) are fans of actual good games like System Shock 2 and so forth and you can see their influences, but Solarix can't even hold a candle to those games, try as it might.\n\nFull video review:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a5c35N727k","May 1, 2015","false","5.5"," 236 of 296 people (80%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","80","236","296","4","24"

It has a dark, sci-fi setting where you need to figure out what happened that killed some of the people around you and turned others mad. While you can use your weapons or your shock device to kill or incapacitate enemies, stealth is what rewards you the most and what you should stick with to enjoy the horror aspect of the game. Besides, you won't have the ammo to shoot through every danger you encounter. If you're into exploring dark hallways with a flashlight in hand and paying attention to the sounds/noises to detect threats, this is the game for you.\n\nAs with any other game, Solarix has its downsides, too. For instance, you can sometimes have a hard time finding your way while searching large areas for your objective without a compass or map. Enemy AI could use some improvement and the areas you can't reach can be made more disctinct by re-positioning nearby objects to block that path. However, the best thing about the game is that the devs listen to the playerbase and roll out patches according to the feedback they receive.\n\nThose who like sci-fi/horror genre should try out Solarix in my opinion and give feedback to the devs to make it even better.\n\nTürkçe:\n\nKorku oyunları hayranı biri olarak, Solarix'i Steam'de keşfettikten kısa bir süre sonra aldım. Karanlık, bilim kurgu temalı oyunda, etrafınızdaki insanların bir kısmını öldüren, diğerlerini delirten şeyin ne olduğunu anlamaya çalışıyorsunuz. Silah veya şok cihazıyla düşmanları öldürmek ya da bayıltmak mümkün olsa da oyunun korku yanından keyif almak için en faydalı ve en tercih etmeniz gereken yöntem gizlenme olarak öne çıkıyor. Zaten silahla tüm tehlikeleri yarıp geçecek kadar merminiz olmayacak. Karanlık koridorları elde fenerle keşfetmeyi, seslere dikkat ederek tehlikeleri sezmeyi seviyorsanız, bu oyun size göre.\n\nHer oyunun olduğu gibi Solarix'in de eksikleri yok değil. Mesela hedeflerinizi ararken bir pusula ya da harita gibi yol gösterici olmadan geniş alanlar tararken bazen kaybolmak mümkün. Yapay zeka biraz daha geliştirilebilir, erişilemeyecek bölgeler eşyalarla kapatılarak daha belirgin hale getirilebilir. Bir de oyundaki hikayenin bir kısmı ses kayıtları ya da evraklarla değil de sinematiklerle aktarılsaydı büyük bir artı olurdu. Bütçeyle ilgili bir durum olabileceğini düşünüyorum. Öte yandan oyunla ilgili en iyi şey ise yapımcıların oyuncu kitlesini dinleyerek aldıkları geri bildirimlere göre yama çıkarmaları.\n\nBilim kurgu/korku tarzını sevenler bence Solarix'i denemeli, oyunu daha da iyi hale getirmek için fikirlerini yapımcılara iletmeliler. Türk yapımcılara vereceğimiz desteğin, yeni Türk oyunlarının çıkmasına yardım edeceğini düşünüyorum. Oyuna Türkçe yama çıkacağı söyleniyor, onu da söylemeden geçmeyeyim.\nAşağıdaki linkte Solarix oyunu için videolu incelememi bulabilirsiniz.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNwbAB3QjkQ","June 26, 2015","true","4.2"," 49 of 59 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","49","59","0","0"

You actually feel emotion from the vocals rather than a standard monotone voice. You feel like you know the personalities of Betty, AMI and EYE with each conversation uncovering more lore and a deeper understanding of each of their roles.\n\nThe monsters themselves are a variation on humanoids therefore not providing the full horrific feel which the developers are trying to pull off however the musicality is spot on for a horror game especially when entering a new area or turning a corner :).\n\nThe game astetics are wonderful, although the maps are linear. In terms of the objectives however, you do feel that the areas are open ended.\n\nI played this game the first time on the hardest difficulty and in my opinion it was not too difficult, there are some areas which may take several attempts but the AI's tracking patterns become familiar therefore being able to avoid them becomes simple if you are patient. I would have liked it to be more challenging when there are difficulties involved.\n\nThe AI itself is not the most intelligent but when they do spot you their melee is unavoidable due to the flinch you take, in other words, if you get spotted you are most likely dead.\n\nThe weapons, shocker, pistol and shotgun are useful but ammunition is limited however this game is supposed to be played stealth not run and gun, if you do run and gun you will just get frustrated.\n\nWith the 1.2 update the developers resolved a lot of issues, bugs and complaints from their audience, you still need to crouch 90% of the time but at least you move faster. There are some areas in the maps which have invisible walls which seem like they can be passed and some boundary issues but no game is perfect.\n\nIn my opinion the cost of this game may be a bit pricey as the game can be completed within 5 hours with little replay value once you have discovered the plot.\n\nI don't want to give too much away, but with clear cut environmental graphics, chilling music, a deep story and professional clear communications via Betty, EYE and AMI I do recommend the game.\n\nPlease see the video review here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBzOhjBKPC8 related to our YT Channel for more information regarding Solarix.","July 4, 2015","true","5.4"," 32 of 36 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","32","36","0","1"

Since Outlast actually but everything changed! Everything changed when I tried Solarix, a game created by Pulsetense Games and published by KISS ltd! Solarix is a science-fiction horror game featuring open-ended levels for both combative and stealth-focused playstyles. The devs have managed to combine old-school sci-fi horror with next-gen style and graphics.\n\n\nThe story follows an electrical engineer desperately fighting for his life, after an infection wipes out an interstellar research station. He must contain the disease, battling both the remnants of the crew and his own fracturing mind. The goal of the devs is also to go beyond jump scares and cheap thrills. Solarix is about a world that overpowers you with unease, insecurity, and desperation, forcing you to confront your own role in the horrors to come. Solarix is definitely one of the good representatives of the horror genre games.\n\nIt features a lot of jump scares, like for example that zombie in the window that really scared the hell out of me in the beginning of the game. Another aspect I loved is the whole atmosphere the game creates. Dark, full of horror aspects but everything has such a unique feeling at the same time. Moreover, another aspect worth mentioning is that I liked the balance between stealth, FPS and horror.\n\nBasically it is up to you to choose how you are going to play the game! Are going all stealth? Avoiding your enemies and try to hide in the darkness or just kill everyone? It up to you!\n\nAlso, a strong positive of the game is definitely the storyline. You try to understand what happened? Who are you and what you have to do to survive! However there are some negative aspects I should mention! Since I reviewed the beta version of the game! There were bugs in the gameplay and the music. Also, sometimes I felt a little bit lost inside the levels, I didn’t know what to do or go! Another thing that it should be improved a little bit is the dialogs. They should introduce better the characters to the player and who they exactly are and their role in the game. But that creates a sense of mystery which is great and you eventually learn more about them as you continue your journey.\n\n\nTo sum up, this game is a lot of fun, scary and delivers an incredible gameplay experience! Totally recommended it by me to all horror and sci-fi game lovers out there!\n\n\n\n\nVerdict: 8/10\n\n+ Atmosphere\n+ Jump scares\n+ Balance between stealth, fps and horror but play your way at the same time\n+ Storyline\n\n\n- A lot of characters in the game are left without a proper introduction to the player at first. Who they are etc...but that creates a mystery aspect since we are learning more as we play the game about them\n\n\n","April 30, 2015","true","6.8"," 86 of 126 people (68%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","68","86","126","9","10"

This is not like recent horror games where it relies on jump scares but rather the creepiness factors comes from mood and story. If you really pay attention to the story, the whole game will be more meaningful and fun just like in system shock and dues ex series. However, keep in mind Solarix is not "deep" like system shock series but in this age of copy-pasted survival-minecraft games, Solarix is refreshing and  is as old-school as it can get. If you really dig solid sci-fi experience, It is totaly worth the money for 20 usd. Also there have been three patches already and A.I is getting better and better with every patch.

An old school horror game (With actual horror) with a great sci-fi feel that, should the develpers decide, could become part of a larger series. Yes, the lore of it is just vague yet vibrant enough to fulfill the wonder that is curiosity. The game does exactly what a horror game should, like Outlast or Alien: Isolation which is keeping your teeth clutched in curiosity to find out, yet biting so hard that at the first sign of something terryfing, crack goes your molars. Although that is an exageration, some levels are scarier than others.\n\nDuring the begginging of the game, from levels 1-3, the game is more puzzle than horror. Like the fear is put on as a dress and the human is an adventure. That may be judging the book by the cover, but in most horror games, the mechanics are puzzle or action. The developers were keen enough to put the better before the bad. Even later, you can still call the game an adventure game, where as Dead Space was action with horror and puzzle side points, Solarix is an adventure and horror hybrid with action and stealth tacked on.\n\nYes, action and stealth happen to be the tacked on bits in this game, but niether are actually bad. I spent most of my time and experience in a lower formed version than what is out now, that is saying that I dealt with more bugs and glitches than the average player. Stealth was always functional, as was the action (Shooty, shooty, taze, taze), but that isn't to say there weren't undefined facts. First, the very primier enemy you face is based on both hearing and vision. So you have to walk slowly and hide in the deep shadows. That's actually pretty smart and sensible. The second enemy is very ill defined though. It's defined by it's looks and lore, but not by any attributes or feature, as in "What is or isn't there?!". It's a zombie like enemy, walking in random patterns and always groaning. so you'd think from the last enemy, maybe I can do what I did with those other guys, but be a little louder, but that's incorrect. It's tough to find more paths around them, but the waiting adds a sense of tension and heart pounding moments. The occurance of being seen by them is an almost scream worthy moment the first time, but other times, it does become frustrating, more and more each time.\n\nHow does the action hold up? Not what many would define as well. As I said, I played in a much lesser version, this is to be taken with a big handful of salt, and worse, I can't think of a better way than a list.\n1) Shooting is weak enough to feel useless, but it's hard to remeber how weak it is. It's only good against the mercenaries, not the zombies.\n2) Throwing things do not damage enemies, but it's all a stealth mechanic, not an action one.\n3) Ammo isn't plentiful, early game. The first paragraph description that the develpers give is not true, it's very difficult to get through any level simply based upon action.\n4) The action, for myself, created stress from frustration, not stress from tension or fear.\n\nThis game is a stealth game, and it should very much be treated so. It may seem actiony, but it's not very. Stealth is how you progress. There is this one thing though, the game pushes you into action. It provokes you, make you careless. There is a character, who should be called Psycho girl I don't want to even assiociate with but there's not off button in my Helmet, whom constantly tries to provoke you. " You're nothing but an animal." "You'd've killed those people if they were in your way." "You can't stop me". All in all though, it's quite a wonderful place to be. It's a lovely game, an even better addition to any horror game collection, right beside Alien Isolation and Outlast.\n\nAnd in as a Plug, I played it for Youtube as well, you can see what I mean, but there is the problem of some recording issues that happened. Good day, or if you play the game, good night. Bring an extra change of pants. Or a new chair. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USCccr05O_8&list=PL_dXC6EA3yjmdWHqjaGF2rs108-ByRfPe","July 19, 2015","true","6.2"," 29 of 34 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","29","34","0","3"

Within the first five minutes the much different look and atmosphere of the environment reminded me of the first SYSTEM SHOCK game where everything felt new and alien with the pleasure of me learning the world as if on my first day in school or at a job.\n\nThe sound effects and ambience is a work of pure otherworldly intensity combined with the placement of the game world's inhabitants in the right spots it really can get dramatic along with heart pumping startling. I love the voice acting which gives off a sense of me wanting to trust these disembodied voices in this hostile environment yet something tells me to hold back and see how things play out. Audio logs are also very well done with a serious side to them in the same manner as the ones in the first SYSTEM SHOCK game where i feel like am in a environment of scientists and workers who treat their jobs with very strict disciplined standards.\n\nStealth is full of high tension reminding me of the fear i had playing the first two THIEF games as i try not to be seen or caught. Using ones environment to stay quiet and invisible is paramount to survival and or taking out enemies unnoticed. One more reason i feel like trusting the artificial intelligence voice AMI which runs the complex or the anarchist sounding female who pipes in with crazy talk or maybe not. Time will tell. The isolation felt in such a game world definitely has me reaching out for any possible allies. That male voice though from the preview trailers i have seen seems way to sinister to trust and thus far ingame i have yet to change my mind. Now that i think of it he reminds me a tad of H.A.L. from 2001 A SPACE ODYSSEY.\n\nSOLARIX definitely disconnects me from reality with all its atmosphere. The scaling of the environment is excellent sometimes giving me a feeling of being on the set of the first ALIEN movie with a sense of grandness. I also love the fact that i dont have to go total stealth by using properly timed head shots on enemies who can kill me in an instant if am not extremely cautious.\n\nGraphics have a certain cold retro hardcore style with its mixture of blinking lights and strangely comforting computer monitor screens amidst a worn industrial facade as if neglected from centuries of wear and tear.\n\nThus far am having a frightfully fun time with SOLARIX. One of the reasons it feels so much like SYSTEM SHOCK is it has me constantly learning and adapting ratching up the tension and keeping me on the edge of my comfort zone.\n\nSOLARIX definitely feels like "old school" pushed to the max of excellence. For someone who appreciates the gameplay and art direction of the first QUAKE, SYSTEM SHOCK, TERMINATOR FUTURE SHOCK, THIEF, ARX FATALIS this is a masterpiece of artistic intensity.\n\nSOLARIX a dark malevolent future where the truth unfolds as a forboding mystery novel upon the id of your mind's eye. Buy it.. play it and pray its only a.. game.","May 12, 2015","true","3.6"," 21 of 26 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","21","26","0","0"

It can feel a bit slow paced at times, but that's entirely down to your playstyle.\n\nSince I'm a horrible scaredy cat, I prefer to mostly sneak everywhere and take my time. It pays off rather well, as the story expands through the normal playthrough and also through emails, and audio logs you come across. There's also a somewhat deranged woman trying to track me down with the promises of having "fun".\n\nThe story might feel familiar at first, as there are only so many ways to write these; but it does so extremely well. I've always liked games with good lore, and a decent story and I rather enjoy it.\n\nStealth games rarely appeal to me, especially suspenseful ones that keep you on your tiptoes, but Solarix is fun.\nYou can't simply run and gun, you're horribly outmatched and need to outsmart opponents at every turn. Especially since ammo is scarce, and unless you've got aimbot skills you're going to have some issues.\n\nThe audio is really what makes the game. It creates an atmosphere of slight dread, and fear, with copious amounts of suspense. So much so that any sudden loud noise in the game can give you a start. Hearing someone's heavy slogging footsteps come closer and closer as you sneak around the dark is fantastic, and unnerving.\n\nNow the graphics aren't anything special, nor do I feel they need to be. The game is well crafted, runs really well, and conveys the story and gameplay the way I feel does it justice.\nSure everyone would want Crysis levels of detail, and I'm rather fussy with games always trying to max them out. Solarix though really doesn't need it. The Unreal 3 engine does them fine, runs well, and is stable.\n\nI should note that no matter what, the game framerate was always capped at 62 for me. The developers say there are no caps for it, but despite my monitor's refresh rate of 144Hz it refused to go higher. I also have two GTX 980Tis powering it.\nIt's honestly not an issue, but I feel it worth mentioning.\n\nThere are also some slight movement, and pathing issues here and there for enemies. Especially if you distracted them from their patrol or area by creating noise through throwing objects. Although these are rare. I've only seen one enemy get slightly stuck at a barrel.\n\nThe areas are quite varied, going from a patchy forest, to foundries and even space ships. Although due to the nature of the game, it's always rather dark, and corridor like. I did get a bit of a Doom 3 vibe at parts, but thankfully the game doesn't rely on jump scares.\n\nNow, considering what's been said in in-game dialogue and messages there is plenty for the developers to expand on their game universe. I certainly hope they do.\n\nI would easily recommend the game for folks that like Sci-Fi and stealth.\n\nPC Gameplay Footage\nhttps://youtu.be/AMXri8SzBow","June 10, 2015","true","6.2"," 19 of 23 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","19","23","0","0"

I love a dark sci fi setting and thats why I actually bought the game; reminded me of Alien and Aliens and kinda gives a claustrophobic and worn down feeling just like those two movies. However I played less than an hour before I found some bugs that really killed my immersion, when detected the AI soldiers seem to glitche towards me crouching and standing at rapid speed while fire and endless stream of accurate bullets and their detection mechanics appear to be broken, they can detect me from any angle whether they are looking or not, but only when I am moving it seems. I'd like to see this polished a little more before I continue playing.","May 1, 2015","false","0.7"," 45 of 71 people (63%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","63","45","71","3","0"

It does have leaning! And will remind you of SS2 a lot while playing it. You can also eliminate most sources of light to improve for a better stealth environment.\n\nEnemies are really sensitive and will react if you're too close to them generally meaning certain death due to the high damage enemies do and the limited ammo which wasn't an issue for me since i completed it without killing anyone and stunning everyone, stunning enemies works correctly but you have to be extremely precise on where to hit them.\n\nA few bugs and glitches here and there.\n\nThe plot is good and really similar to that of E.Y.E and SS2.\n\n\nYou will only enjoy this game if you love and are an expert on first person stealth games, otherwise move along.","March 8","true","13.0"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","15","17","0","0"

I love how the story unfolds into something deeper the further you go. Not to mention things get REALLY creepy. There were definitely moments where I was jumping in my seat.

It's a BS excuse for not being original enough to come up with your own story.\n\nThe "stealth" is atrocious, you can stand right next to an enemy and they won't see you as long as you're not directly in front of them, but if you even DARE to stop crouching and try to walk 15 feet away from them, they will instantly swivel around and instantly firing/running at you. There's no enjoyable aspect of this, you can't fight enemies outright because the developers were too lazy to live up to the "open-ended levels for combative playstyles" they lied about in their description, so you must spend almost every minute of the game crouched down, sneaking past these enemies with awful AI that is supposedly "Advanced."\n\nThe audio is awful. Every 5 minutes the game plays this looping hissing sound that alternates between stereo and mono, which causes my ears to hurt within 15 seconds of it starting. The voice clips are muffled and of poor quality; I had to resort to subtitles to understand what the hell anybody was saying in the audio logs. Speaking of subtitles, there are an insane amount of spelling mistakes, it's like nobody even tried to spellcheck this game. In the first 30 minutes you go looking for a "PoweCell" and listen to "Incorent Audio Recordings".\n\nThe game is extremely linear, there's almost nowhere else to go besides where the plot tells you to go, so the game consists of crouching around, solving extremely easy puzzles, and listening to the characters who are all D-grade versions of characters from System Shock 2.\n\nThis could have been a good game, but instead its just a game filled to the brim with flaws that ends up being a poor copy of System Shock 2 rather than its own game.","May 2, 2015","false","6.4"," 41 of 65 people (63%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","63","41","65","6","0"

Right, first lets get this out of the way... this game cannot compare to system shock, deus ex etc. I really like cyberpunk, horror and stealth games so I decided to give it a go and I wasn't left disappointed. You need to overlook a few things in this game maybe even a lot such as getting stuck a lot,  enemies become alert for litearlly no reason sometimes, it's extremely hard to knockout someone because you have to be standing up to do it and do it from behind (as with pretty much every other stealth game) however if you stand up and take even a single step the enemy will become alert, turn around and kick your butt. Also it doesn't really give that much information about what to do and where to go (I personally prefer it this way, I feel like games nowadays make it too easy for the player) which maybe a problem for some of the more impatient gamers. As other people have said, you WILL crouch throgh most of this game.\n\nWell those are the bad things about this game (ones I can remember at the moment). So why give it a positive review you may ask? I don't know whether it was intended but I found the game more creepy than scary although it was a bit scary on maybe 2-3 occasions, that being said I really enjoyed the creepiness. I really enjoyed the story it kept me playing the game and wanting to get to the end, to understand what is going on, see what's caused it, how it ends etc. As I mentioned before I love stealth games and although the stealth may have been quite broken every once in a while, getting through the game without using your weapons or using them very rearely was fun and quite challenging at times.\n\nOverall I think the game is worth a playthrough, it's not "amazing" or "mind-blowingly good" but it will keep you entertained for the few hours that you play it and if you get bored or angry at some of its faults, the story will keep you going.","May 2, 2015","true","18.2"," 18 of 24 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","18","24","0","0"

If you'd like to read our full in-depth review, you can find it here: http://www.universalgamingreviews.com/solarix-overview-review/\n\nI received a Steam Key from Kiss Ltd. so I could write our review.\n\nSolarix is a sci-fi based stealth game that takes a lot of inspiration from the classics like System Shock or Deus Ex. The game can be played without killing anyone but the game does leave some freedom to go in guns blazing. This isn't always the best idea however as ammo can be quite scarce and it's a better idea to save it until you really need it.\n\nThe game features some excellent lighting effects and the atmosphere is really good when you have the sound way up. The hand animations could definitely use some work and some of the textures are noticeably low quality but it still looks great overall.\n\nIf you're looking for a stealth based game to play, definitely look into Solarix, it's not absolutely perfect but the developers did a great job with what they had and its worth checking out.

(Probably one of the first to beat it as well.)\nSolarix is a pleasant surprise amongst the Stealth Horror" genre.\nIts a very different game from your average stealth romp, it plays similar to Thief, mixed with a hint of Deus Ex and all wrapped up in System Shock 2 sauce.\n\nThe game's story was a great and pleasant surprise, although it defintely overwhelms you at first as you are thrown alot of details, some which you won't really get until later in the game. Where the story really starts picking up, the characters start to become fully realized in their intentions and things come full circle. I won't spoil it one single bit for anyone that wants to enjoy it for themselves, it is honestly deeper than it is initially thought up as on the steam store.\n\nThe Locations have a good variety to them, and remain for the most part open world. They also do a excellent job of building atmosphere, like all good horror games.. you are spent the majority actually all of Solarix, alone. Absolutely alone, with nary a friend in the world. Just trying to get by guards and zombies. There are things to pick up that don't initally come over on the subtitled conversations or audio logs, like little computer tid bits, actual audio/video onscreen and a few of the characters. There is every now and then always a sound of a nearby zombie/strogg/idk. Some of the ambience sounds repeat which is a bit annoying but nothing too serious.\n\nThe Gameplay can tend to be a bit repetitive in the first half as it introduces its mechanics on the colony. There is a bit of confusion also in the level design in the first half and it made me a skeptic of what else the game had to offer. By the second part, i started getting better and started really enjoying the game, the atmosphere and the story. It wasn't triple AAA but it was entertaining and i liked the homage to the games of the past like System Shock 2. (One of my favorite games of all time.) If i had any tips to give to you, its that guns may seem like a very easy way of taking your enemies out at first and running past zombies is totally possible, later in the game is absolutely not lenient on you. Use the electric back prod, stay in the shadows and keep your guns locked and loaded for something scary or if things go wrong.\n\nI came into Solarix with bad impressions, the presentation of the beginning didn't exactly thrill me after experiencing Ghost Ship CDF, which was also built in UDK and it felt like a very similar vibe. Until i really dug into it.\n\nIn terms of horror, at most the game gets unsettling, like you defintely wouldn't want to stick around for an extended period of time. Nothing like system shock 2 where you didn't feel safe at all because of the occassionally respawning enemies. Solarix has a good reason not to do so, because late in the game enemies are much more difficult to handle. Requiring more ammo and different tactics to take out your enemies. It almost turns into a puzzle game of when to  strike during the patrol pattern. I grew to like it.\n\nNow, comes down to the bad parts.\nThe AI isn't very good, and can give you some seriously weird moments where you'll walk directly past a enemy and he won't give a single ♥♥♥♥. Where he'll glance at you for a moment, you'll sh*t yourself and he just walks right past you. Yes, alot of that will happen while you are playing Solarix. So much its kinda jarring. I wanted so badly for the enemies to interact with each other, particularly the mercs and the zombies. Or to see a merc so very rarely, freak out and lose his ♥♥♥♥ and start killing his comrades. Stuff like that would stop the AI feeling like a bunch of patrol patterns and little else.\n\nThe story at the start is too overloading, it either doesn't tell you what the point of being there is or who these characters are and what is their purpose. Maybe its a way of not patronising the player but it got confusing for the first half. Some of that confusion is absolutely intentional however, so don't jump the gun and that is as much of a spoiler as i am giving you for the second half of the game.\n\nI'd also say that if Solarix would have been developed in another engine, it would have looked a little better. I mean it doesn't look bad by any means, just not great.\n\nThe gameplay feels a bit repetive, just a little. If they kept it fresh towards the end it would have been great.\nMaybe add in a another enemy type for that extra challenge towards the end because once i got to a certain point then that was a breeze.\n\nI feel the price point is right, for the amount of fun that i had with it. I would recommend hard for an extra challenge because normal wasn't particularly challenging except for the very end. If you love sci-fi horror games, its still worth the spin even if it isn't particularly scary. If you have played Deus Ex, System Shock 2 or Thief then you will like this game, i am pretty sure about that.\n\nI'll probably come back to it after awhile and replay it on hard, since i had a fair amount of fun with it.\n\nTL:DR?\n\nFantastic for the money provided you like the mediocre mechanics and well crafted story.

On easy setting, there's an element of stealth, sure, but you do have the option to just run around shooting everyone, albeit carefully. As soon as you up the bar, however, you need to creep in the shadows and create distractions as well as any Adam Jensen or Altaïr. There's enough design in the world to keep you immersed in the story but not enough to distract from the game at hand.\n\nLet's talk price. If you can convince yourself to go and drop sixty dollars for a AAA release that might disappoint you, then you can definitely pony up twenty and get a game that supports indie devs and will genuinely hold your attention, and who knows? Maybe it'll even make it into your top ten. I know it did for me.","May 20, 2015","true","2.6"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

However, it manages to step out of the shadows and grant a fresh experience into a genre that has thus been lost since the early 2000’s.\n\nIs it the best game I have played? No. It is worth the asking price? Yes. Why? Because it might not be an AAA title, it does show merit and passion that has been missing from games. Yes the game has bugs, and yes the developers “have” and “are” working on numerous patches to fix these problems. Even with the remaining technical bugs, the game is fun, enjoyable, and just down-right frightening.\n\nReview breakdown:\n\n+Story\n+Soundtrack/Audio\n+Environmental Art\n+Gameplay Mechanics\n\n-Replayabilty\n-Graphics are a bit outdated compared to newer game (but to be fair it was build using UDK)\n-Difficulty can ramp to being super hard at times\n\nOverall this is a great game and everyone should support the team behind Solarix.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GameReviewsAU/recommended/284990/","GameReviewsAU","GRAU","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GameReviewsAU/","44 products in account","Pulsetense approached GameReviewsAU to have their game reviewed via the gaming platform Steam. In our opinion Solarix goes beyond our expectations and proves to be a great game. And for something so absorbing to be produced via an Indie developer is even more surprising.\n\nThe Story\nThe story of Solarix is inspired via a range of classic science fiction films. You play as an engineer, delightfully named Walter, who is fighting for survival after an unknown infection wipes out the population of an interstellar research station. Walter must try and contain the disease whilst battling the remnants of the hostile crew and struggling with his own fracturing mind.\n\nSolarix does a great job using sound and music to invoke different feelings. Harrowing sounds await you just outside the first room’s door and they constantly change and follow you depending on what is nearby. Malfunctioning computers whir and buzz as it sounds like they’re struggling to boot up, creepy and atmospheric sounds stalk you as your journey through the remnants of the space station begins.\n\nThe voice acting is described by Pulsetense as being professional but I would say it sounds even more professional than most next-gen games. Good voice acting is absolutely key to engaging gamers minds and Solarix has done a brilliant job in finding their voice actors. Betty’s character is delightfully disturbing!\n\nThe Gameplay\nYou can choose your own way to play. Burn through your ammunition like a crazy person, sneak around without laying a finger on the hostile opponents with the help of throwable objects to create distractions, or creep up behind enemies and stun them with your stun gun.\n\nPersonally I preferred the stun gun method but when push came to shove, the pistol (or at a later point, the shotgun) ended up playing a important part in my survival.\n\nAesthetic Charm\nIf Solarix is what we should be expecting to come from Indie developers, then I’m incredibly excited for the future! The textures for everything are sharp and detailed, enemy design is so imaginative and the scenery is breathtaking. When you get the chance to see your surroundings from outside you’ll be blown away by the sheer enormity and scale of each level.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, sound plays an integral role in Solarix and should definitely not be overlooked when playing this game. At times you’ll hear haunting music playing to accompany the situation in which you find yourself, and trust me, wearing headphones whilst playing is an incredible experience. If you have a super sound system then please hook your computer up and play Solarix. I’d love to know how good it sounds!\n\nThe Bugs\nWith so much to deliver, of course there are going to be a few bugs which is the only downside to Solarix.\n\nParts of the environment that look accessible can often be unaccommodating. The jump key almost seems a bit pointless seeing as you’re able to jump over ledges lower than a person’s ankles. However, getting rid of jump altogether would make some parts of the game unplayable which you’ll find out about as you play.\n\nIt’s quite easy to get trapped inside walls, forcing you to restart from an earlier save and sometimes when you’ve loaded up a save game you are presented with a world full of nothing. This, once again, forces you to restart from the beginning of a chapter which could prove to be even more troublesome.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nI was blown away by Solarix and find it to be an incredibly exciting yet disturbing adventure. It’s been quite a while since I was creeped out this much by a game, but I’m glad Pulsetense have managed to pull it off!\n\nRead The Full Review Here[gamereviewsau.com]","January 19","true","7.0"," 15 of 24 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","15","24","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/heavymetalgamershow/recommended/284990/","heavymetalgamershow","HeavyMetalGamerShow","http://steamcommunity.com/id/heavymetalgamershow/","153 products in account","Solarix is a first person shooter/stealth game, with survival horror thrown in set in a sci-fi world. The gameplay and story is great. I like the stealth aspect, along with the hacking aspect that let's you get through doors, shut down turrets, and do hacking to help you get around. That really reminds me of the original Deus Ex, which is always great to see another game use a similar style.\n\nThe stealth aspect is very cool, I love stealth games, and the way it's done in Solarix reminds me of Manhunt. You hide in the dark, sneak up on the enemies, and use the taser on them, or you can shoot them in the back of the head with your pistol. Although wasting bullets would be ridiculous since you have limited ammo.\n\nThe graphics are great, very well done, the setting is dark, but has that sci-fi feeling to it. Fits perfectly for stealth, and even that survival horror aspect. There isn't much for music, although it's more ambient, and fits the setting, for instance, you could be sneaking around, hear a noise, look around, and see nothing, that really fits the game. The voice over work is great, although Betty annoys me, but that is the point of Betty.\n\nThe controls are easy to understand, although some might get confused that the "use" button is the spacebar, rather then "E" on the keyboard, but it shouldn't take long to get the hang of that. They are very responsive, no slowdowns, or anything like that.\n\nSolarix is a damn good game, very fun, I put 14 hours into the game, and enjoyed every minute of it. Although I did run into some flaws, nothing real major, because I could continue the game. The first flaw, was loading a saved game, and I would fall through the world, and die, I would reload, and it would continue to do that. I did contact the developer on this, and got it figured out, the easiest way would be to restart the chapter. The other flaw, would be the game crashing a few times, but this didn't happen often, and I continued through the game. I am sure updates will, happen. If you like survival horror/stealth/first person shooter games, check out Solarix.\n\nIf you want to see my full review of Solarix, I did do a Youtube video review of the game, you can find it at this link below:\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQXo_OwaREc\n\nI want to thank Pulsetense game for giving me the opportunity in reviewing their product.","January 29","true","14.8"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","1"

The fact the guards & zombie 'things' actually sometimes change their pattern is fun. (I think its a glitch but still).... The ambient sounds and effects are nice.  Graphics are fine, the lighting is fun. Detail is in the vastness of the unknown, more then the graphic details and depth of map, in this game.  Being able to explore beyond the designated map, really gives you the sense that there is freedom.  Which is a good thing, after all most times dreaming of the gift is is better then opening it.  To be honest, I wanted to play Desu Ex again.  I wanted a game that gave a non scripted feel to the challenges.   Purchased this game because some reviews said it was kinda like that.  The computer voice does sound a lot like Eliza, so points for that at least.  So I guess in a way, this is like Deus Ex...... in the same way it is looking at your sister wearing yoga pants.   I'm coming from the mind set of Team Fortress and Half-Life before there was a digit after their names.  I mean, Longest Journey, expectations. . . This does truley feel like at best a beta release.

Any thoughts or comments expressed are entirely my own.\nOne of the games I was really exited to review is Solarix. After all, it promotes features most avid gamers like to see in a game: puzzles, combat, stealth and horror and all in a dark, cruel setting. However, to my disappointment, the element of horror was not as dominant as I expected it to be in the first place.\n\nThere are plenty of enemies but in general they were mostly predictable and easy to avoid but nevertheless that requires you plan ahead and stay hidden in the darkness.\n\nThe graphics and tectures are really nice and sometimes i found myself lost in the map. That was because the map was rather simplistic, a screen shot, I would say, which doesn’t pinpoint your location which had as a result to cause confusion and loss of orientation.\n\n\nHere's a quick list of pros and cons:\n\nPOSITIVESGreat graphics and textures.\nGreat sound.\nNEGATIVESNot a bit scary. 404 Horror not Found.\nSome glitches\nIt feels kinda void.\nOverall, I felt that Solarix would have been a lot better, had it been as “scary” as it was promoted. Nevertheless, I believe it has the potenτial to be a great game, since it has great mechanics, interesting story, cool sound effects, textures and graphics.\n\nRead the full review here[www.blowsomesteam.com]","December 20, 2015","true","40.1"," 12 of 20 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","12","20","0","0"

It took a little bit for me to pick it up, as I couldn't back them on Kickstarter and I also wanted to catch the game on sale because it was a little ambitious, and post release the feedback wasn't encouraging, to say the least. On sale, this game is well worth the price of admission, but not without its flaws.\n\nWithin the first hour of the game I found myself fairly immersed in the world of Solarix. The game is something of an amalgamation of a Giger-esque science fiction setting with stealth primarily rooted in the Thief series. I can feel notes of Dead Space in the story, as well as System Shock, but neither of these inspirations are truly borrowed from in full, and that serves to set it apart from those franchises. The game does a great job of setting up a very atmospheric and realistic world, oftentimes content with letting the player wander and see what they can see, but this is one of the aspects of the game that I feel is somewhat of a double edged sword.\n\nWhen the player wanders away from mission goals, immersion begins to set in, especially in non linear games leaning on exploration. Solarix seems content to remind you that if you decide to leave an area and your minor objectives in that area have not been completed, the game reminds you aggressively with a pop up. This seems somewhat odd a problem when there are so many subtle but effective ways in the canon of game design to keep a player on task without pulling them out of the experience.\n\nWhile It is fairly obvious where to go, it is difficult to follow an exact path because well lit areas more often than not serve as places to avoid, lest you get put down by a mercenary or one of the infected. Pulsetense had a huge opportunity there to add tension to these small moments, but instead I'm left feeling somewhat disappointed because the game requires you to spend your time on objectives that are vague about why they are treated with such importance. That broke the immersion quickly and unpleasantly for me in one instance when I found myself prodded to backtrack and explore two buildings that didn't necessarily serve a purpose other than to grab access cards and listen to an audiolog. Whether that series of events was important or not, I just wish I had a choice.\n\nWhile I recommend playing the game for the sheer amount of effort you can see from a team that has never produced a finished title, I can only recommend this game with half of my heart. On one side, the game is beautiful to look at, even in Unreal Engine 3, and I admire the scale and ambition that Pulsetense accomplished with this title, but on the other hand, it hasn't truly brought anything new to the table to mix up the Looking Glass Studios formula, and I find that serves to lessen the impact of a title that could have been a bit better than just good; instead something much closer to remarkable.","May 25","true","0.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I can only say how I felt about the game. Sorry for any bad english, not my native language you know... :p\n\nSolarix is a scifi horror game, made by the Pulsetense Games, and anyone who has played Systemshock 2, may notice, that these have something in common. After all Solarix was influenced by it, one of the most epic scifi-horror-adventure game. And Solarix does it well for  indie game. Not entirely the same though. No adventure game, but dark creepy atmosphere, that has some horror elements, and well written story - that sometimes leave you puzzled on what to believe. Unlike many other indie games in my opinion, that tend to be bad, this one works good. But I have to admit on the horror factor, I didn't felt scared all that much.\n\nFor me it was all about stealth: sneaking around the enemy without getting noticed. When they turn around, hack that door open and slip in undetected. Hide behind the shadows and possibly go around them. Yes, you can hide in the shadows, like in many other stealth games. I usually tend to play stealth games in a way, that I don't kill anyone. Sometimes it works in this game. In the beginning you need to sneak your way past them. You don't have any guns yet. Sadly when you do get a gun, (tazer in fact) it's better to just taze them out. Sometimes in a situation you don't have any choices. You can only knock them out if you sneak behind one and aim the tazer to it's head. That doesn't always work though. It's really about what angle you do this.\n\nThere are many infected enemies to go around, and also non infected. These non infected are people behind the mask, and they're tough. You can't really go shoot em up on them, you have to plan ahead. Guns don't pack a punch all that much, but then again I was playing this on Hard difficulty - and also it's not meant to be played like uncle Sam would. Even the infected creatures don't die easily. Some do, but some of them seem to act like indestructible. (multiple shotgun shells, and still not dead o.o) I don't mind this, although it does sometimes get on my nervous :L and they sometimes act so unpredictable. They don't always follow that usual pattern, which leaves you more alert. I literally sneaked the whole game through :D\n\nUnlike many other indie makers, Pulsetense Games has done pretty good job. Sure there are some minor unfinished edges here and there, such as falling off the floor :< which made me replay a whole chapter once more. This only happened once, so it might not even happen again. I'm not gonna say anything about the graphical stuff, you can just check the photos for that, and make your own opinion. For me it's between decent and good. I'm not much of a graphical dude. If the game is good, that's all that matters.\n\nI also don't want to say anything about the story, cause I don't want to spoil it to people. Let's just say that there's a computer A.I called A.M.I, and human called Betty, that are guiding you through the darkness of infested planet and spaceship. Your goal is to find the cure. Let's just say that there's more to it than that ;)\n\n\nShort version: This game is for stealth fans, and for those seeking for a scifi-space-horror like game, with deep story build into it. It's not an adventure game. It's pretty much moving to point A to point B type of adventure. It took me about 10 hours to beat this game. First time playing on hard difficulty, and while recording a playthrough for it. Sadly, there's no replay value, which is really important for me :/ unless the story is unclear somehow. Maybe building achievements would help. Very tricky ones ;)\n\nAll I can say is that I liked it. Well done, even with some minor fall backs. Usually all games, especially indie games tend to have. But Solarix is still better than most of them.\n\nIf you're like me and like playing stealthy, buy it ;)\n\nCheers ^^","January 8","true","10.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

It's a nicely woven tale with several layers that all come together at the end.  Interspersed throughout are a few subplots told through PDA's and email.   But it's the main story that really carries the game.  The voice acting is surprisingly good.\n\nI also liked the massive scale of structures both on the planet and of the ship itself.  I found it fascinating, making my way around the environment, to wonder what everything was and how the colony originally operated.  Lighting was always dark and oppressive, fitting for a stealth game with horror overtones.\n\nGameplay was ok.  Not stellar but not bad either.  I was instantly reminded of Thief: The Dark Project.  Solarix is a stealth game and so confrontations with enemies tend to end badly and are best avoided.  I played on medium difficulty and found the game fairly easy.  The game uses checkpoint saves which are usually sufficient.  There was only one point where I wished I could have saved progress due to a tricky area.\n\nWhile Solarix succeeds in many ways, its low budget production values show.  Complicated machinery constructed with different parts is often covered in a single texture (which isn't a big deal given how dark the game usually is).  AI isn't very good.  Enemies stick to the exact same patrols unless alerted.  Enemies sometimes appear to get stuck.  At least on medium difficulty detection distance is pretty forgiving.  I also got stuck (i.e. immobile) on different maps 4 times and had to reload the game to continue.\n\nBut overall I thought the journey was worth the $10 I paid.  I completed the game in about 11 hrs.  If you are looking for a solid sci-fi/stealth experience with an engrossing story, Solarix delivers.  Just don't expect AAA production values.","March 29","true","10.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

It happened to me on the first level (fortunately), the rest of the game I was lucky...\n- Combat SUCKS ♥♥♥, there is no two ways about it. If you're spotted just reload, it's not worh it and it will leave a sour taste in your mouth\n- Weapons are underpowered / bulletsponge enemies on normal, the "shocker' could really use some kind of "in range" cue\n- graphics as far as models and texture variety goes are nothing to write home about, but that is to be expected given the size of the development team\n- smaller bugs, got stuck on geometry one time, the enemies "limp" on air, pressing buttons/terminals sometimes not triggering events and need a couple of trys\n- achievements seem to trigger at random\n\nI picked it up on sale for 10 euro, which I consider a fair price for this game.\n\n","February 24","true","9.4"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

I adore science fiction and the stories it tells, but Solarix is overall a polar disappointment. While the setting of the game paints several passions, there is a perpetual lack of product robustness to it. Several environmental assets have no collision, AI has halted player recognition and gotten me stuck without any input control, and I have met several times with the edge of the terrain map. While an indie title, a few things can become forgivable, but it's a real shame when the world is pieced together with assets void of the potential of the Unreal Engine. The introduction to Solarix screams developer drive, but it quickly grinds against the guardrail until becoming unplayable when previous checkpoints reboot to its faulty AI's instantaneous, trigger-happy bloodlust of player pathfinding.\n\nTo talk sincerely to the devs, you DO have CLEAR potential, as it is visible in small numbers here. But what Solarix needs most would honestly be another SOLID year of cracking development accompanied with a second draft.

I like stories of such games. The story made me go on with this game. If it wasn't for the story and the curiosity of what's coming next, I probably wouldn't play it. But it is enough for making it worth playing, even if it reminds me more of a class B-game not fully tested, even in version 1.4.\n\nThere are places where I easily get stuck and need to reload savepoints usually because I can't move. Even savegames failed again and again in one chapter, made me restart the chapter twice. If you look at the textures a bit closely, there are lots of places they made easy solutions and with lots of glitches. Just strecthed the textures for monitors, doors and other objects. Rooms and areas where you only could find a single healthpack and so on, made me feel like I wasted time to explore. Enemies who walks out of their path or are getting distracted could get stuck, get in loops or do "funny" things. Somewhere the physics isn't right either but I won't tell where. And there weren't actually variations of objects to use or the way to tell the story.\n\nBut if you get used to that, the story and things to do is interesting enough.

This description is incorrect, as I played for two hours with no scares whatsover.\n\nConsidering that this is one of my favourite genres it takes a lot to bore me, but Solarix is mindnumbingly tedious for a stealth game. Bizarrely you move faster crouching than you do running, though if you alert an enemy it's pretty much game over on hard. Which isn't helped by some autosaves plonking you right in front of an enemy....\n\nThe stealth is too easy but also unreliable, and weapon / item  switching takes ages when playing with a gamepad. The plot seems okay though I haven't seen all that much of it - and to be honest am not that bothered about playing further.\nI really enjoyed games like old school Thief/ Outlast / Alien isolation/ Penumbra / Soma, and wouldn't compare Solarix to those - it lacks atmosphere /  scares, and isn't very compelling in general.\n\nBear in mind though that this is only a few hours in - it may get better, but I seriously doubt it.\n\nEDIT: Played it some more......\n\n1) The story - crap, has a "twist" that had me in stitches it's so poor. If Ken Levine is the Stephen King of twists, then whoever wrote this is the Dean Koontz (or M Night Shamalayan if you're not familiar with one of the worst authors you could read)....I was laughing, which is not a good sign when you're trying to be dramatic....\n\n2) The weapons (when you get some) are awful - the shotgun does less damage than the pistol, and has terrible hit detection.\n\n3) At 70% completed I died, and the autosave happened at the exact same time - so now when I reload it instantly goes back to me being dead, and asks me to reload. Around and around it goes.....\n\nIn essence - this game is rubbish!! The fact that there's an easter egg of a computer that's playing System Shock 2 is laughable, as that game is hands down miles better than this, and whilst it's not a stealth game you would be better off buying that instead. Despite being fifteen (or so) years older it\nembarrasses Solarix in every way.\n\nBuy the real deal and not this glitchy, mediocre imitator! Which, by the way, is not scary or "horror" in the slightest!!","February 20","false","6.3"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","3"

Unfortunately for me, as you can see by my shorter play time, the game bugged out and my save loaded with the camera sinking through the environment.  It just wasn't worth replaying the game to get back to where I was...\n\nAs far as my impressions of what I did get to play, the game OK at best. It is a novel title that if you are very hard up may prove to be fun, but there are far better games than this to play in this genre.\n\nGRAPHICS\nGraphically this game looks horribly dated, for a title that came out in 2015, it is horrendous.  Texture quality is bad and optimization isn't very good.  With a 980 ti that was hitting 39% @ 4k, I was seeing a lot of screen tear, it lessened at 1440p.  The lighting is fairly good and sets the mood, but the fire effects aren't even on par with the first half life.  It's dreadful really.  The Unreal engine is capable of so much more than what is shown here.\n\nSOUND\nSound wise, the atmosphere is done really well, conveying the dread well.  Audiologs can be hard to hear at times, due to the overpowering ambience, but this is forgiveable.  Character noises i.e. grunts and things, are laughable at best and completely pull you from the immersion.\n\nAI\nThe AI in this game is bad.  Constantly getting stuck on the environment, failing to fully investigate thrown objects that have all but bounced off of them.  Thier vision cones are terrible as well, sometimes allowing me to stand right next to them and at other times they would spot me in the dark, behind things at distances that were crazy.\n\nCONTROLS\nThe controls were fluid and smooth.  I never had any problems here, except when I mapped buttons and the contextual messages didn't change.  It's a small thing, but something that bothers me.\n\n\nAll and all it's not a terrible game, but at this pricepoint, I say nay.","February 25","false","2.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"
