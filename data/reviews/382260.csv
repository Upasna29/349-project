"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ShitBackInLimbo/recommended/382260/","ShitBackInLimbo","Shepard","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ShitBackInLimbo/","45 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nGenre: 2D Platformer/Indie\nNote: Copy provided by the developer/publisher for the purpose of beta testing.\n\nThis game has a singleplayer and right now only local multiplayer(it's still not known if that will change). It may not be clear enough on the store page, but the game is more multiplayer oriented. Gameplay in this game is pretty simple and pretty smooth. In singleplayer you can only jump and double jump. Landing on the small places can be a bit tricky at first, but it's not that hard to get used to it. Only addition in multiplayer is that you can shoot in some games.\n\nSingleplayer\nSingleplayer right now consists of only two worlds and it's called "No Friends"(just saying so people don't get confused). Story is about Santa trying to save the world from swaggy Hitler, so it has funny moments. Every world has 12 levels, where levels 12 and 24 are bossfights. Levels in the first world are pretty short, usually not that hard to beat and same goes for the first bossfight. As for world 2, you can really see an improvement there, since levels are now better designed, much harder, and longer. There's one level in the world 2, that looks like Flappy Bird game, except you're driving an airplane, so it's a bit different than real Flappy Bird and not that hard. Singleplayer also has "No Death Run" and "Speedrun" modes. I am not sure how many more worlds will be added since it's still an early access, but from what I've heard singleplayer is just a bonus and right now it's pretty short. Takes between 2-2.5 hours to beat I would say since the second world is pretty hard, so you can get stuck somewhere for a while.\n\n\nMultiplayer\nMultiplayer is like I already said only local for now, and it has pvp with 2-4 players. Right now it consists of 12 games. This is the list of games: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=527371719.\nYou can deselect the games that you don't want to play in a tournament. Before starting the tournament you need to select one of many characters that you want to play with: Santa, Joker, etc. http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=527396989\nand many of those characters can be unlocked by playing the story mode. When tournament starts, games are selected random. In Battle Arena for example first who kills opponent 5 times wins, in Trap Run first who reach the finish wins, Blast Cast is like Bomberman, plus there's Duck Hunt- remember the game on Sega where you needed to shoot ducks, well this is it, except it's pvp. All in all multiplayer is pretty fun, and playing with more people certanly makes it more fun and probably more confusing since the levels are not that big for now at least.\n\nVerdict: Decent game, that is most fun when you play it with friends. Has singleplayer too right now, however it's pretty short and consists of 2 worlds.\n\nPersonal rating: 7.5/10","October 1, 2015","true","21.3"," 17 of 26 people (65%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","65","17","26","2","2"

I have a group that plays TowerFall and SpeedRunners like twice a week. We will try anything that supports major local co-op action. This game was a no brainer.\n\nWhat is cool about this title is that the game modes are randomized for each round. One round may be a race, one may be a deathmatch, and yet another may be an obstacle course. The variety is great. Everything stays lite and accessible for newish players yet there is still some cool difficulty for old-school gamers. Here is a great example of how they accomplish this: there is a room with lots of spike hazards, and it is a race to the end. If you can get to the end without touching a single one - you can win it in one go, BUT if you touch a spike, it is removed, essentially making the run easier. You keep respawning infinitely after death.\n\nTotally accessible game that is really fun for local co-op. I highly recommend.","October 2, 2015","true","1.7"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","11","16","0","2"

Also,the deatmatch fighting arenas (yes,we need more ahah) would need some more  weapons and hazards,like the gramophone music,which is awesome.\nWinning round/winning animations for the sprites would be interesting.\nSome fancy descriptions for each achievement/colectibleThat's all I can say for now ;) Keep up the good work.\nI totally reccomend it for some casual fun,specially the ol'Hitler story and the multiplayer drinking game lol.\nI would also like to specially thank the developer for it's kindness and patience :3 Such people are rare to meet those days.\n_-Flux","November 17, 2015","true","4.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","1"

This is the game's greatest strength at this point in Early Access. While the game doesn't have a lot of mini games at this time, I actually had quite a bit of fun with some of them. The other mini games were solid as well. If the developers continue to add mini games, I think 8Bit Fiesta could be a good game.\n\nAt this point 8Bit Fiesta is more of a multiplayer game than a single player game. 8Bit Fiesta does have a single player mode which is pretty typical platformer. I have played some of the single player and there is nothing wrong with it but there is also nothing special about it.\n\nIf you are looking exclusively for a single player game, at this time I don't think 8Bit Fiesta is worth it. If you are looking for an interesting local multiplayer party game though, I think 8Bit Fiesta could surprise you.\n\nNote: I received a free review copy from the developer.\n\nRead My Full Review [www.geekyhobbies.com]\n","October 4, 2015","true","1.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

It has  local co-op as well as a single player story line with some over the top humor. Play with your buddies, or all alone at home (like me ;~;)\n\nThe Good, and the BadPros:\n-You can play as Santa\n-Funny single player story line\n-When you double jump, you fart\n-Great party game\n-Tons of character to choose from\n\nCons:\n-Almost impossible to play with a keyboard (you will have to have a controller for this one)\n-It is really hard (obviously meant to be this way)\n\nMy VerdictIf you need a fun game to play by yourself or with friends, this game fits the bill.\nStill in early access, but looking foreward to see more coming in the future.\nDifficult to play, near impossible to play perfectly.\n8/10\nCurator review for Vantom giveaways.

Not much else to say.\nThe controls are supported on keyboard, but it is recommended that you play with a gamepad (again, like Super Meat Boy).\nHonestly, there's not much more to say.\nTL;DR Super Meat Boy x Alcohol.\n8.7/10","November 15, 2015","true","0.9"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

Most games are either really fun at being single player, or multiplayer. This game manages to be amazingly fun either by yourself or with friends. I've played this game for hours by myself, and get excited as I pass each level to see the next challange and items being incorporated. During my birthday recently, a bunch of friends started playing this with me and we were all addicited. Even better, the developer seems to still be adding to this game, and also is very responsive to customers! I emailed him with a few bugs I found and a couple of suggestions my friends and I had recently, he verified the bugs and had them patched within a day or two. He also said he liked my ideas and would look into adding them in a future version. If you're on the fence about buying this game, hopefully this review helps make up your mind. Highly recommended!","April 10","true","6.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

What to say?\n\nWhen I first sat down with this game I didn't know what to expect. Turns out it was the best thing ever, even tho as I am writing this wannabe review I have only played for about 40 minutes. The gameplay, at least singelplayer wise is very similar to Super Meat Boy, it's hard yet really fun and the story.. Well, we got Santa Clause chasing after Adolf Hitler. What more could you ask for? There is also minigames and multiplayer, Can't really speak for the multiplayer seeing as I haven't really tried it yet in my extremely long 40 minute playtime, but the minigames are great!\n\nIt's definitely worth a buy if you need ha fun, simple yet hard game to pass your time with!","April 19","true","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is a great party game with lots of content since when I first got it. There is a ton of stuff from minigames resembling mobile games to Nintendo games. For people looking for a great multiplayer/split screen experience you cannot go wrong with this game. Content is added regularly and yes there are bugs but for now that adds to the style of the game. But hopefully after early access it gets better. Can't wait to see where this game goes. I will probably have spent several hours with friends on it before it gets out of early access.","May 21","true","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"
