"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/21100/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2818 products in account","F.E.A.R 3 is the last game in the F.E.A.R  series thus far, releasing in mid 2011 on PC, Xbox360 and PS3 being developed by Day 1 Studios, the same guys which developed the first F.E.A.R on PS3 and Xbox360.\n\nThe bulk of the gameplay is the same as the previous titles with a few minor changes.  The main one being a change to how the cover system work. In the previous games you used to be able to tilt your character’s head around corners in order to shoot, F.E.A.R 3 adds a peeking system, where you can hug up against any sort of cover and drop your headup and down whilst also moving side to side in order to shoot from cover. This for me felt a lot easier to handle than the previous version and is a really nice change.  The rest of the game play is very much the same, I was a little bit let down by the gun mechanics however, I praised the first game heavily due to how the gun play feels so fluid and responsive, sadly in 3 I had a lot of trouble aiming whilst looking down the sight and spent the majority of the time shooting from the hip. This was mainly because the hit detection on the bullets is quite a bit off, you can sometimes get a direct hit on an enemies head and nothing happens.  There is only one new weapon to be introduced in the game too, a freezing gun which you obtain by overcoming one of the many fights with the same boss throughout the single player campaign mode.\n\nGraphically, F.E.A.R 3 looks OK. It is 4 years old at this point and you can tell it is part of the last generation of gaming, but it still holds it’s own compared to games released around that time. The texture quality is just bog standard OK again, where the F.E.A.R series does well, is the animation of the characters, they all have a very good ragdoll effect to them, meaning death animations are all on point and can result in some unique positions.\n\nF.E.A.R 3 isn’t hard when playing on the medium settings; FPS vetrans need to bump it up to hard mode for it to be even slightly challenging; I don’t think I died more than two times throughout the whole game which is something to be said given the amount of bosses you have to fight.  Some levels are actually made significantly easier since they give you a mech suit to use which whilst it is absolutely satisfying to blow up enemies at point blank range with missiles, it does make the level seem somewhat pointless as there is no challenge and just feels more like a time block than anything else.\n\nUnlike the previous games; the levels in F.E.A.R 3 are very linear and leave very little for the player to explore and find secrets/collectables. There is one collectable on each level which is randomly placed every time you play, but there isn’t extra bits of lore/plot to be found from hacking computers, or finding documents;  something which I did miss as the story in this game is actually somewhat interesting compared to the last games.\n\nA single play through this game took me just under four hours; where you will get the majority of your replay ability from F.E.A.R 3 is the co-op mode and challenge system. This is the first F.E.A.R game to have any sort of co-op mode in and it does it very well. The multiplayer missions feel very much like Killing Floor, so if you enjoyed that, you will get some enjoyment out of the F.E.A.R 3 multiplayer too.\n\nI only had one technical issue whilst playing, and that was when playing with more than on screen, your mouse will sometimes exit the screen you are playing on and when you click to shoot, you’ll minimize to your desktop as it has roamed onto another screen – this became a real annoyance on the latter levels when you have very little time to react to things. I was unable to find a fix for this online so be warned!\n\nTo sum up, F.E.A.R 3 is definitely not as good as the previous two games, but it does offer something a bit different. The price on Steam of £12,99 is a bit steep given the shortness of the single player, but you can pick up the entire F.E.A.R collection from Bundle Stars for a mere £3.26 - https://www.bundlestars.com/en/bundle/fear-bundle  meaning you can’t really go wrong with picking the title up there.  Going off that, I am only going to recommend F.E.A.R 3 when it is on sale.\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Not Recommended\n3) Only recommended when on sale\n4) Recommended\n5) Highly recommended\n6) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AestheticGamer/recommended/21100/","AestheticGamer","AestheticGamer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AestheticGamer/","3606 products in account","FEAR 3 represents what is wrong with many 'modernization' processes of games. It takes everything that people liked about the first few games in the series and just replaces or modifies them to work with current trends, such as in this case regenerating health, co-op, perks... However, I would also argue FEAR 3 is not a bad game. If you're looking for a game akin to FEAR 1 or 2, this unfortunately is not it. It also is pretty lacking in the horror department. It's not scary, or even really atmospheric, though it attempts to be. What it is though, is a pretty fun multiplayer experience.\n\nThe story will probably ♥♥♥♥-off long-time fans. Without going too deep into spoilers, the story basically focuses mostly on Fettel, the antagonist from the first game. The story's already kind of in a mess from the get-go, as we have things from psychic powers, clones, the fact our two main characters are the sons of the series main antagonist Alma, and just other plot elements that just scream they're so bad. But it's not badly written to be fair, and if you kind of turn off your brain it's kind of stupid entertainment. But you really shouldn't be playing this game for the story.\n\nThe campaign should last for about 5-7 hours, with some highs and lows, but that in no way compares to the previous two games. The co-op helps make it a bit more fun, for better or worse. The two brothers play completely differently though, with Pointman basically being your typical action hero with the guns and the slide-kicks, and Fettel being actually surprisingly rather fresh, being a psychic man who can levitate enemies, possess them, shoot energy blasts, and more. Honestly, both are pretty fun, but I have to hand it to Fettel as for a game with very little inspiration behind it, his gameplay is actually rather original for this sort of game and fun.\n\nBut it's not the campaign you should be buying FEAR 3 for, as weird as that might sound. I find most people never delve into the multiplayer modes in this game. And it's sensible, as the campaign is disappointing and usually multiplayer modes are tagged on without much thought or effort, so it's probably nothing special, right?\n\nWell, that's wrong, as it turns out the multiplayer modes in this game are actually the best part of the game.\n\nI can't even count how many friends who got FEAR 3 that ended up loving the multiplayer modes and hating the campaign. Let me explain; The campaign lacks tension, and often is a bit repetitive, on-top of the fact it just feels rather uninspired most of the time, its horror elements fail, and its action sequences aren't particularly great. But something FEAR 3 does surprisingly well is understand the fun elements of multiplayer shooters. Hell, some of the multiplayer modes are even far more tense and more horror-like than anything in the campaign.\n\nMultiplayer is split into four modes, and all four are pretty fun for up to four-players either locally or online. Each mode has different maps. One mode has you all as ghost phantoms who possess bodies and try to kill other enemies and your friends to collect souls, most souls at the end of a wave wins the round, and at the end of all waves, person with the most rounds won wins. Another mode has you in an open arena with multiple areas to station yourself in as you and friends fight hordes of enemies that come in waves, boarding up windows and between waves going out to collect supplies. It's a sort of rip-off of Zombie mode from CoD, but it has some interesting twists, such as Alma, who you should not look at as she'll cause randomized effects against you, ranging from just downing you to making you see your friends as enemies, making the screen go black, or teleporting you to another random point on the map. Or a fog, that gets thicker and thicker as the waves go on, and an unseen red-light monster lurks in the deeper parts of the fog... And in yet another mode, you and up to three friends run away from a giant wall of death. Really challenging, frantic, tense, panic-worthy, but a lot of fun as a lot of enemies get tossed your way and you only get small breathers to quickly recollect supplies before the wall is out it again. A race from death and survival that is both primal but also strategic and fun.\n\nThe game also looks pretty good, and the PC port is well-done. Music works, but nothing outside of the credits song sticks as being particularly memorable.\n\nFEAR 3 is against most everything the FEAR series stands for, but if you can look over that and a disappointing campaign, I guarantee you there's some multiplayer fun here that may be worth experiencing.","April 15, 2014","true","26.4"," 91 of 104 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","91","104","0","3"

Another shooter has fallen to the subscriptions of substandard Call-of-Duty-esque gaming.\nF.E.A.R. 3 is a game in which you (assuming you play as Point Man, the long-time protagonist of the series.) and your dead, cannibal brother, whom you killed, team up to... Uhmmm. Do something? It involves Alma's baby. That's all that's really made apparent.\nFirstly, the "dramatic story-line" they boast about on the store page has little relation to the actual game. The story-line was little more than a rail for you to follow from shooty-segment to shooty-segment. In fact, since Point Man is completely mute, they never really elaborate on why exactly he wants Alma's baby. Maybe it's to shoot it? But that contradicts the ending... I dunno.\nSecondly, the game is named FEAR. Shouldn't actual fear be it's main and central focus? Well, it's not. In fact, the FEAR franchise has gotten less and less scary as time's gone on. Sure, there'll be the creepy black figure running across a gate every once in a while, but it all falls flat when you perform a psychic link on a random corpse for "Rank Points" and it gets plastered all over your screen in the middle of the supposed horror that you "HAVE RANKED UP TO LEVEL __"\nLastly, however, the co-op is fun. Not exactly difficult, even in the hardest difficulty, a friend of mine was able to pick the game up and immediately demolish everything. But nonetheless, it was fun. However, it continues to take away from the percieved horror of the game. No matter what game it is, cooperative horror doesn't work. When you have a friend singing "Fireball" on the mic, any horror in the scene tends to be lost.\nSo, if you played the original F.E.A.R. and are looking for a second dose of the thrilling horror that was in the first game, go buy the original Dead Space. If you're looking for a great story plot with lots of depth and heart-wrenching moments, then go buy The Walking Dead Seasons 1 & 2. If you're looking for a mediocre cooperative experience to share with your friends for about 5 hours of game-time, however, then you've come to the right place.\n\nTL;DR: Not scary, not deep in story, not good single player, not difficult, but a nice little 5 hour time-sink for you and a friend.\n\nI do not recommend this game,\n»ZCC« Zombie Chicken","November 1, 2014","false","13.0"," 109 of 147 people (74%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","74","109","147","7","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/8799644/recommended/21100/","8799644","Vegetarian Atheist","http://steamcommunity.com/id/8799644/","507 products in account","The first F.E.A.R. was an outstanding masterpiece. The two following expansion packs were so so.\nF.E.A.R. 2 was great in my opinion. The game had a crappy story although the pacing of the game was good, it also featured a smart AI, it had amazing visuals (fire effect, smoke, explosion, close combat, firefights, etc), some great scares and a convincing atmosphere, etc.\n\nF.E.A.R 3 features an even smarter AI. The enemy soldiers are quick to take cover, switch positions, retreat, suppress you, throw grenades, flank you and charge you when they can. There's also plenty of enemy chatter that you can hear which allows you to anticipate some of your enemies' movements. They will also call you out if you are hiding for too long.\n\nNeedless to say, the AI as advanced as it is in Killzone 2,3 which features the smartest FPS AI to date. In fact, the AI is sometimes so smart, it becomes punishing. Plus there's no blind fire option, you make peek out of your cover and unleash small burst but you will almost certainly get return fire. Your screen WILL stay red for an extended period of time after being shot at. You may also chose to stay in cover until the red screen goes away, but sometimes you can get approached by a guy with a shotgun who will blow you away.\n\nYour flashlight will also expose you to your enemies just like in the first game. However, I tested this further and found out that the enemies will react to your flashlight even IF they do not face you, meaning they react to your flashlight being turned on, they don't react to the flashlight necessarily because the AI field of vision picks it up.\n\nThe cover system is outstanding and I can only wish that most if not all FPS featured this kind of cover system. The Killzone franchise invented this realistic cover system first though.\nWhen you take cover, you do not get the chance to view yourself in the third person perspective nor will you be able to magically see everything that is going on around you. This time, the only way for you to view your surroundings is to peek from a cover. It is too bad there's no leaning option, but you can lean easily when in cover.\n\nThe bullet time is back and it works the same way it did in F.E.A.R 2, although it drains slightly faster, at first at least.\n\nOh and also, Paxton Fettel is back! Damn did I miss his voice. "They all deserve to die..." Although, if you want to play single player, you can only play as Point Man. Your co-op buddy therefore can play as Fettel. This time around, Alma won't shred your enemies as often. You'll have to rely on Fettel more to do the job. Although you yourself have some psychotelepathic skills. Fettel's abilities are slightly overpowered but he makes for an awesome anti-hero.\n\nHowever, F.E.A.R has always been a franchise about the single-player experience. The co-op campaign might be slightly unfounded here. Fettel's occasional remarks do not ruin the immersion of the game, but they do ruin the time when you immerse yourself enough to believe that you are the only one fighting the enemy - all by yourself. He is always there somehow, watching your every step, so you never really feel alone. Ultimately, the co-op is a great add-on, I'm just not sure if the F.E.A.R. franchise really needed it. There are some games out there that scream co-op but don't have any, such as Clive Barker's Jericho for instance.\n\nThere's also a horde mode, reminiscent of the Call of Duty Zombie mode. You still build barricades and get better weapons but this time you are fighting the smart AI that is assaulting your position instead of shooting brain dead zombies.\n\nIn general, the game play is extremely rewarding. The guns feel real, although shotgun looks quite idiotic.\nThe firefights are realistic enough: the recoil, the smoking barrel,the destructible environments, the matrix-looking like bullet movement in slow mo, the human-like AI - it's all there. You can also slide over cover just like in Brink.\n\nIn general, the controls are pretty fluid except for when you push the button to take cover and then if you need to desperately displace, you will need to push the button again to exit cover and sometimes that will get you killed, unless you keep pushing "S" but forget about exiting cover any other way but by pressing the cover button. Switching cover is also very fluid - something that Killzone did not introduce.\n\nAnother huge positive note is that you can actually see your legs! how awesome is that? You don't get to see that too often. However, you do not cast a shadow all the time, just in some places. Also, one of the most satisfying things in F.E.A.R. is throwing a grenade at a couple of guys, shooting a couple of guys in slo-mo and finally kicking the last standing guy in the face therefore destroying the entire squad in seconds.\n\nThe graphics are satisfying to say the least, there's also Directx11 (IGN's gripe about the supposedly outdated graphics while reviewing the game on PS3 is therefore unwarranted; the AI issue is also redundant because the AI is insanely smart). The story is enough to keep you playing although the cheap Alma scare tactics can give you slight jumps even though some of them are cliche and predictable. The atmosphere is solid, there are some major set pieces.\n\nOn the negative side, those mech robots are back and man do I hate those stages. I prefer a great tactical FPS as opposed to silly arcade mech warrior shoot-ups. I'm disappointed they brought these mechs stages over from F.E.A.R. 2. because these frustrating levels are unnecessary.\n\nThe game gives you plenty of opportunity to sneak on enemies and take out one or two before others react, but the game does not give you the opportunity to silently kill the two and have the ability to shoot the rest in a quick fashion.\n\nAlso, the melee kills should be worked out. It feels sluggish and consolish because the melee kills are auto aimed for you. Sometimes you get to kill your enemies instantly with a knife if the knife slices their head. Sometimes, you have to slash them several times for them to die, not only that, they often have the balls to fight back as you keep slashing their face.\n\nUltimately there's not that many negatives, as far as the solid gameplay is concerned anyway, F.E.A.R. 3 is a solid shooter.","November 27, 2013","true","26.6"," 124 of 171 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","124","171","0","0"

If you like F.E.A.R. it's bad.\n\nThis game should have never been called fear. I say this not just for the spurious representation of the classic fear games, but for the fact the game is not scary. The original fear is in my option a revolutionary game, the level of detail and thought put into it was tremendous. This game however has little to none to connect this to the original fear.   The Replicants are gone. The invisible assassins are gone. This does not seem to be a fear game, and that is a good way to put it as this game seems more like another. Call of duty clone is not a term that should be used likely but the similarities are far too obvious, nearly all of the original mechanics of fear(health/armor, specialized weapons) have been torn out to put in call of duty mechanics(health regeneration, riot shield, flash grenades.).\n\nThe first level says it all for me. I start crawling through the jail not sure what going to happen when I realized. It's too bright. The first “scare” was little more than an special effect and Alma saying hello. Next a power failure, finally some scary scenes. However before one jump scare the lights come back on. Finally, I as the middle of a firefight when I see an enemy above me on a catwalk. My thoughts went as follows. “Crud, im going to have to walk around to get at him.. wait, this a fear game, there quality games, I should be able to shoot through the floor!” this is when I realized this is no fear game.\n\nAnd it really isn’t a fear game. Like the other fear games, it was not made on the LithTech engine. This engine gave fear so much more than other games. I already notice several missing refinements. The levels where sloppy. In the first you knew what way to go. It gave you plenty of lighting hints movements and other cues to push you in the right direction. I got lost many times in this one.\n\nLastly the story, to be honest, If you did not play Fear 2 you would not care about 70% of this story. Truthfully If point man where to just walk away the same ending would have happened.  There are many issues with the story that I could argue but I think the main issue I had was Alma. All the way through the fear games Alma has been set as a boogeyman. And even though a new creep one was created for this she is still this silent super being, beging in the shadows in the first game was okay. This was the story of the story, but now that we have reached the end her character barely develops from being a bump in the night.","February 4, 2014","false","6.0"," 87 of 123 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","87","123","0","2"

Perhaps, that was not the case for you, but it was for me.  Eventually, I was able to run it with decent hardware and I never looked back.\n\nF.E.A.R. stepped into the seen in slow-mo and then it took the first-person shooter genre by storm, tailored to shooter and survival-horror fans.  F.E.A.R. 3, while the weaker follow-up to the F.E.A.R. series still holds up as an atmospheric game with solid gunplay and an interestingly shocking ending like its predecessor.  Some may complain that the formula is becoming boring and stale, but it is still a perfectly decent addition to the franchise.\n\nAs a fan of the Dead Space series, I found F.E.A.R. 3 to have a commanding presence when it comes to atmosphere.  I would argue that F.E.A.R. 3 nails the atmosphere and overall eerie-filled environments better than Dead Space 3. The attentional to detail is more adequate in some areas than others, but it has enough going in that department to earn a ribbon.\n\nThe gunplay is rock-solid, which makes gameplay worthwhile.  Along with the cover system that lets you peek while in cover, quickly lean to the opposite side and aim, it nails the cover-system just right.  For those that are looking for a more conventional F.E.A.R. 3 tactic and approach to gameplay, it is still all there and nothing much has changed if you want to use slow-mo and the run-and-gun variety.\n\nEven on the easiest difficulty, F.E.A.R. 3 can present some difficulty spikes.  A franchise that basically expects a player to run-and-gun using the slow-mo function, you could be taken down quickly on normal difficulty.  It asks you to be tactical while using slow-mo.  It is slightly different from F.E.A.R. 1 in that you are not only running into singular rooms, using slow-mo, and unloading.  There are plenty of cover usage so you will need to run from one cover to another while using slow-mo.  Think of it as a Chinese action film with lots of gun-fighting.  It can be quite satisifying at times, but the variation comes in with using cover to get to where you need to go without dying outright.  I hear it is a common complaint among the series' fans, but I did not find a major issue with it.\n\nF.E.A.R. 3 is far from great and it is worth noting that it is not spectacular as the original F.E.A.R.  Either way, it manages to be a perfectly decent addition to the series without presenting any major quams.  It is successful at being a solid first-person shooter with the well-known F.E.A.R. elements.  While I cannot comment on the co-operative play because I have no experience in it, F.E.A.R. 3 offers enough there to warrant a purchase on a decent sale.\n\nI paid $5 for it and I thought that it was worth it.  I cannot say for sure if it would have been worth $10 though.\n\nIt's a rock-solid game to the series.  Just do not expect another F.E.A.R. 1 and you will enjoy it for what it offers.\n\nGame on,\nElann\n\nRating: 7 out of 10","June 21, 2014","true","6.3"," 42 of 51 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","42","51","0","4"

Sure, it seems like a generic shooter, sure, it's not as good as the past games, sure, it's not scary at all (Hell, not even the "scary" parts were remotely close to being scary to me), but still, I enjoyed this game.\n\nIt's pretty much mindless, dumb fun, not supposed to be taken seriously (Which I know that past games were supposed to be like that), and co-op isn't that bad, to be fair. Of course, playing this game on Co-op makes this game anything BUT scary. Mostly because you can't split up. Co-op horror games are creepy when you are forced to split up. This game doesn't make you do that, hell, you can't even move far away from your partner because (If you are playing as Fettel) you will be immediatly teleported to your nearest Pointman.\n\nCombat can get a bit monotonous at times, fight soldiers here, destroy mechs over there, slay a few anarchy zombies, and use a giant robot yourself! With an exploit, it seems. If you are about to die and you leave the mech and get back inside as quickly as you can, your health will be fully restored. That made the bridge level MUCH easier.\n\nI dunno if mechs count, I dunno if the phase guys in giant suits count, hell, I dunno if the power generator you gotta shot count as bosses.

That's my only complaint about this game.\n\nIf you are a die hard fan of the series, I wouldn't really recommend this. If you are just a fan of the series, sure, go ahead.

Most, if nearly all, fans of the series consider the first F.E.A.R to be the 'best' due to its thick, tense atmosphere and and engaging combat and I agree to a point. F.E.A.R 1 still out plays most shooters and horror games today!\n\nSo with that legacy and high standard already set from the get go, it'd cetainly be a challenge to meet it again, especially in the hands of a different developer!

It's not what I'd call a horror game and that may be a turn off for most. But what it lacks in creepy it certainly MORE than makes up for in fun and replayability! The standard of combat is very much maintained despite the (shock horror) regenerating health and cover systems. The guns have a very engaging feel to them, enemies being gibbed and pinned to the wall or heads popping to the lined up headshot let you know you're in a F.E.A.R game! Regenerating health seems more fitting to the title as the levels are not as big and large scale combat happens a lot more frequently, not giving you time to look for those hidden health boosts in previous games. Cover system can be taken or left, it's simply another option of play style which leads to another staple feature of F.E.A.R 3. Pointman? Fettel? or both? You can now play as the big bad lil' brother in F.E.A.R, who comes with his own unique playstyle of possessing enemies and harassing them with supernatural powers. This can lead to great gameplay choices like choosing who to possess based on position, type of enemy or weapon they're carrying. Pointman's slow mo reflexes and neo martial arts return also adding more choices to how you take out your enemies. While either character is a blast to play with, the real fun and where the game truly shines comes when both monsters are on the field together in the form of co-op. The whole game can be played together where the two brothers tackle the campaign in a ironically funny way. Pointman can slow down time to help Fettel with his possessions or Fettel can quickly take out a strong enemy harassing pointman by either suspending him in midway for Pointman to finish or for Fettel to possess! There's a rewarding and competitive points system in each playthrough to decide who ultimately is the favourite son! Some actions can be performed where you greedily obtain all the points of a situation or share them with your brother depending on the bond with your 'brother' (after all this a game about the strength of 'family' :P)\n\nSeeing Alma subtely appear through out levels is a nice nod to her freaky apperances in previous F.E.A.R games and it was always a cool thing to find! Some level designs and moments can lead to an eerie feeling, but nothing you'd expect from 1, still it's nice to have it there, it doesn't feel like some tacked on thing to a shooter.\n\nMultiplayer is surprisingly engaging, with fun unique game modes like 'JUST F**KING RUN' where you and your team are being chased by a fog of screaming death and your goal is to just keep running towards the goal while taking out enemy obstacles in your path! Though you can't get held up for too long and the fog is ever approaching! Contractions revolves around your team mates stock piling crates found in the map that provide you with weapons and ammo. You repair barricades to doors and windows and together you must hold out against waves of ever strengthening opponents! But be careful! As Alma stalks the rooms and streets and if she catches you staring at her, you're in for a terrible time...\n\nAll in all I was so pleasantly surprised to know that the F,E,A,R legacy (despite the popular cries) was kept in tact whie Day One Studios added their own interpretation to the series and it worked! F.E.A.R 3 is a more than solid shooter that, for me, is still fun and replayable after already 6 playthroughs. The game is short enough for one playthrough with a buddy, take a lll 10 minute break then go straight back, swapping roles and doing it again which is exactly what me and my girlfriend did! It keeps the campaign lean and eventful, nothing tacked on to try and trick you that your getting you money's worth simply because it was so and so many hours long. The game is fun by itself but ultimately, F.E.A.R 3 is best played with a 'brother'. Whether your experience will be about brotherly love or sibling rivalry will depend on you!","July 1, 2014","true","52.9"," 32 of 39 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","32","39","0","3"

Sounds bad, but...Hint: At the end of this review you will find a TL;DR and a video section.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●▬▬▬▬▬[➤ REVIEW]▬▬▬▬●\nF.E.A.R 3, a first-person shooter and direct sequel to F.E.A.R 2: Project Origin, was developed by Day-1 Studios and released by Warner Bros. in June 2011. Day-1 Studios are known for their previous development of F.E.A.R 1 on the PS3 and XBOX 360. F.E.A.R 3 is also available for Windows, Xbox360 and PS3 and runs on a heavily modified Despair Engine.  Unlike the predecessors, it includes now a Co-Op mode for which the whole game feels to be designed.\n\n9 months after the events from F.E.A.R 2: Project Origin, Alma is in her labour ready to give birth to her third child. Unforseen consequences for the real world, the army tries to prevent this from happening. The game starts off by showing Point Man, the first son from Alma, in a prision somewhere in South America, where he gets violently interrogated. His younger brother, Paxton Fettel, joins the interrogation and helps his brother to escape. Both are now on their way to her mother and encounter heavy resistance. Will they both work hand in hand like brothers or has Paxton Fettel a completely different plan?\nThe story itself is not that easy to understand, not even for veterans of this series. While many modern shooters have a great lack of deeper story, F.E.A.R. 3 tries to walk the other way around. Complex narration sticks to the whole gameplay and creates even more confusion than to clear it up. Unfortunately, a real F.E.A.R. feeling does not build up here, yet it is strongly recommended to play through the previous main games to understand at least a few parts in F.E.A.R. 3.\n\nBut the gameplay compensates, where the story more or less fails. In the old manner of classic arcade shooters, the player has to run and gun through a horde of enemies beginning from humans right up to the worst nightmares from hell. Main elements from the previous games, such as the slow motion ability are carried over and got a small improvement. New in F.E.A.R 3 is the possibility to lean behind walls, pillars and objects by pressing the Q-button. This allows the player to shoot from different angels while having the safety against enemies bullets. Does the player wants to proceed he can either press Q again to leave the hiding place or vault over, if the current object or wall permits it.\nNew weapons found their way into the game for example the Goliath, Arc Beam and Riot Gear, while already known weapons, like the pistol or shotgun, got again a more futuristic appearance. The Bullet proofed vest is removed and medkits are now exchanged into a so-called bloodscreen, known from Call of Duty and other arcade shooters. The character heals himself over time, as long as enemies do not hit him. Sadly very annoying and not challenging at all, compared to the other both games before.\nHighly praised as acting smart in the previous games from this series, the A.I lost a lot of intelligence in F.E.A.R. 3. Enemies still search for cover, but mostly run blind into the line of sight from the player. That makes them an easy target and decreases the difficulty a lot, even when set higher.\n\nThe third follow-up offers now the option to choose between two different characters, either the protagonist Point Man or Paxton Fettel, the antagonist. And here is, where the new Co-Op feature comes in. F.E.A.R. 3 quickly makes clear, that it is meant to be played with two people. Depending on who player is the hoster, he plays Point Man in the tried and tested way to gun down everyone who stands in the way. Point Man is also the only one who is able to slow down the time and to use weapons directly. However, the psychic counterpart Paxton Fettel can not use weapons directly but indirectly. His psychic abilities reach from fire blasts of psychic energy out of his hand to possessing human bodies for a limited amount of time if he does not collect enough souls from other killed enemies, what allows him to use weapons.\n\nGraphically, the game can not shine this time. Medicore textures ingame and overall low details disappoint and can not give the player the actual F.E.A.R. feeling, since everything is too much illuminated. Cutscenes are too blurry, but overall surprise with their graphical appearance. Since F.E.A.R 3 is already 5 years old, everything can be forgiveable.\nControlwise, moving around, searching for cover, vaulting over objects and shooting feels very smooth as expected from a modern egoshooter.\nThe sounds are clean and thrilling, for the weapons as well as the surroundings. The voiceacting is even better than before and makes it perfect to listen to the cutscenes.\n\nIn the end F.E.A.R. 3 can not be recommended as an actual follow-up of this series, but for being a very solid egoshooter. Fans of this franchise will be disappointed but if someone is searching for a great egoshooter with unique features, F.E.A.R. 3 offers around 6 hours of a lot of run and gun.\n\n●▬▬▬▬▬[➤ RÉSUMÉ]▬▬▬▬●\nAfter I have finished F.E.A.R 1 and 2 with a more or less satisfied feeling, I could not wait to play through the third follow-up as well. With the expectation to continue where F.E.A.R 2 ended I got greatly disappointed. It feels arcadish, does not include any scary moments and has in its gameplay generally not much in common with F.E.A.R 1 and 2, so fans of this franchise - like me - may be disappointed when playing through this game. Yet, after trying the Co-Op mode I really had a lot of fun with this game. Paxton Fettel, is a brilliant playable side character and through his unique telekinesis elements very enjoyable throughout the whole gameplay.\n\nSearching for a solid egoshooter with cool characters? F.E.A.R. 3 is, what you are searching for!\n\n●▬▬▬▬▬[➤ TL;DR]▬▬▬▬●\n[✔] Very solid egoshooter with unique features\n[✔] Two different playable characters in single player\n[✔] Co-Op (local/internet) and splitscreen\n[✔] Overall improved (but not stunning) graphics and great sounds\n[✔] New feature to lean behind walls and objects to shoot from different angels\n\n[✖] A.I. not as intelligent as in previous games\n[✖] Medkits and bullet proof vest are exchanged into a bloodscreen\n[✖] Story very confusing and overall not important for the game\n[✖] No F.E.A.R. feeling, missing thrilling and horrifying atmosphere\n\n●▬▬▬▬▬[➤ MEDIA]▬▬▬▬▬●\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2snpE0Tx0VE\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=654143342\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you liked this review and want to see more from me, give this review a thumbs up!

If you have ever played a fps then you'll be familiar will everything that F.E.A.R. 3 has to offer, if you have never played a fps before... well that kind of odd and remarkable, and you probably shouldn't have your first fps experience with F.E.A.R. 3. This isn't to suggest that F.E.A.R. 3 is a bad game, but more to the fact that the game lacks polish.\n\nIt has some nice things going for it, the campaign gameplay varies enough to stay fresh, there is co-op (which I didn't get to experience since none of my friends have this game), and the two playable characters feel slightly different from each other.\n\nHowever, the game has significant things going against it. For starters, it isn't scary, which is a problem, considering that it is a horror fps. Second, the campaign itself drags on for way too long and often feels like it is stretching things out, just to fully use an environment (a la, if we spent months making a haunted department store, then the player is going to see every freaking room in it). And lastly, the game's story is very narrow and straight to the point, so if you haven't played the previous games in the series, you'll not going to understand everything that is going on, and even if you did, you're still not going to understand everything.\n\nIf you play this game under ideal conditions (co-op with a good friend that scares easily) then I would image that this game would be great, however, that isn't going to happen for the vast majority of people, so this game is not worth it.\n","November 11, 2014","false","6.2"," 60 of 92 people (65%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","65","60","92","4","1"

Franchise and playing all the games, it hurts me to say that this game is likely the worst of the entire franchise. WB games made a LOT of bad choices with this one. The thing that made F.E.A.R. and its expansion packs scary was sometimes, you don't know if what you are experiencing is a hallucination or the real thing until the end. "Was that person who walked down that corridor real?" You would ask yourself, you would then go down that hallway to help that person to just find a bloodfilled deadend with a healthpack, you would then turn around to see that person you saw stand right in front of you, horribly mutilated before fading into ashes.\n\nF.E.A.R. 2 Was scary but not in the same way as the first, almost everything paranormal or scary you saw was real, not a hallucination which kind of kills the mood. You can tell F.E.A.R. 2 was more focused on combat and some levels were even more Linear than F.E.A.R. F.E.A.R. at least let you explore for health boosters or reflex boosters, or even different guns. F.E.A.R. 2 however only rewarded you with reflex boosters or intel laying out in the open.\n\nThis release, F.E.A.R. 3 had a lot of incoming hype but was ultimately, WB games' futile attempt to close the F.E.A.R. story. It seems that this one was focused entirely on combat though there is not a lot of variation to the enemies. The Co-op option doesnt make my opineon of the game better either, just a way for WB to continue jumping the shark. It may not even as well be CALLED Co-op as it seems to be a competitive shooter to see who can kill more bad guys, who can do more of their special maneuvers and who can ♥♥♥♥ eachother over more by stealing a psychic link behind your partner's back. This isnt the game for you if you want a shooter with occasional scares like the last 2 F.E.A.R.s, ultimately, major F.E.A.R. fans will be disappointed. If you wish to close the F.E.A.R story and dont give a crap about scares, go right ahead. On the other hand, if you want an experience that was in years of development and delivers a ton of scares, this one you can definently skip.","February 2, 2014","false","5.5"," 22 of 27 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","22","27","0","0"

The duck-and-cover nature of the engine is poorly suited to the type of game F.E.A.R. is and the execution was good, but it just didn't fit.  Shuffling game studios hurt the franchise more than helped it, and I would much rather play the first game over the second or third.  The story becomes a bit farfetched at this point--even by F.E.A.R. standards--and the map design made chokepoints predictable and the levels tedious to get through.

You enter an area, kill a few dozen enemies, then they unlock the door to the next area. This pattern repeats to the end of the game. There are no interesting places, no interesting gameplay - its literally just one big shooting gallery with COD-esque gameplay and a points and ranking system. The plot can basically be summed up as "Fettel is resurrected and competes with Point Man for Alma's attention", which in my personal opinion completely ruins both characters. Even Beckett, from the god-awful FEAR 2, was ruined by framing him as some sort of weakling who'd be an alcoholic if he weren't in such dire circumstances.\n\nEvery single positive point to the series was removed in favor of this ridiculous shooting gallery gameplay.

Just a couple of silly things like how they changed the combat and removed health packs and armour but I soon got used to using the radial red/blood onscreen to know when to hide and when to push forward into combat. The story with this one was really, really good and the cutscenes were superbly done. I would've said this game was about as good as 2 but no better, that was until I completed the game as Pointman and unlocked Fettel.  Oh boy. Playing as Fettel elevated this game above F.E.A.R. 2 instantly. I played it through to completion again with Fettel and it didn't feel stale in any way because Fettel is just the most ridiculous fun you can have in a game. I can't use any more superlatives and you should probably buy this series of games and enjoy them.\n\nI recommend this game more than I recommended 2 in my review for that.

The devs turned this once awesome horror series into an action oriented co-op shooter.\n\nFirst off the "horror" parts in this game are neither creepy nor frightening, they're simply annoying. FEAR and Project Origin did their job far better in this regard. In addition to describe the A.I. as weak in this game would be an understatement. It was a huge step backwards from the previous games.\n\nIf you don't play this game in co-op be prepared for very unfair fights. How about fighting a mech with little to no cover or possibilities to avoid damage and your opponent having a huge amount of health and hitting like a truck? Sounds fun doesn't it? (not to me) - The "boss fights" are not really what I'd call challenging as they don't require that much thinking. It's just kill them faster than they can kill you.\n\nThe story is just a mess. Characters from the previous games don't make any sense and there are plotholes all over the place.\n\nFinally from what I saw the multiplayer was dead on arrival. There was only these gauntlet like missions and no real player vs player action. But even in these co-op missions you have to compete against your teammates. If you are to slow or not good enough you will be left behind or have a negative influence on the overall performance.

It tries to spice things up with a first person cover mechanic, but it doesn't add very much in terms of usefulness.  In fact, it's a bit wonky and often times hinders you.  There were several times I was hit while "in cover" without being able to see the enemy in front of me.  Fetel's possession and psychic mechanics seemed fun, but you need to complete missions as point man first to unlock him.  I only played him for a few missions.\n\nSpooks are pretty half-hearted and sparse in this last installment of the FEAR series.  A big part of that coming from not really interacting with Alma at all.  Nearly all dialogue is given to you through your bro. who is disturbing, but not really scary.  Alma was center stage for FEAR 2, and it's what made for great spooks.  Here you barely feel her presence at all and her personality is nonexistant.\n\nSome sections of the game look very dated graphically.  Much more so than FEAR 2(as I remember it).  Some approaching FEAR 1 levels of meh.  This usually isn't a concern for me, but it has me scratching my head on how much of a graphical downgrade they seem to have had between sequels.\n\nThe sound design is pretty terrible.  FEAR never really had satisfying gun sounds, but sometimes there will be something that happens in a scripted scene, like a head exploding, and there will be no sound effect paired with it at all.  Pretty immersion breaking.\n\nOverall an OK shooter with tepid spooks.\n\n4/10","November 8, 2015","false","7.8"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

Indeed, having capitalized on a "scoring" aspect, the developers have even more attenuated clean visceral quality to the first episode. This change, in the line of the FEAR 2 and coupled with a still good AI, has the merit to bring a lot of dynamism to the gunfights. In addition, his Coop and Multiplayer, limited to 4 players but original, eventually lengthen the lifespan. Ultimately, immersion is lost what is gained in intensity.

And actually you can play 2 characters, the other one being Paxton Fettel, the other son of Alma, but only when you have finished the game once. There are 2 different endings. The first, which is probably the "real" ending is the good one of the Point Man and the other one is the Evil end of Paxton Fettel.\n\nThe Story itself is easy explained. You have to reach Alma because she is giving birth to her new child.\nBut this is a hard and stony way especially because you have to escape from a prison first but because both brothers working together it works. Working together more or less. But beside you are hunted by your bad memories of your childhood which feature Harlan Wade, the "father" of Alma. Saying father is this case is an insult because he is a real ****, well you know what I mean. You have to forget your memories of Harlan Wade.\n\nOn your way you pass many levels and especially different ones! No level looks the same and this is actually what was really amazing! Never saw so much variety and nice design in the levels. Pretty much the best from all F.E.A.R. games but this is probably the only aspect thats better compared to other games, sadly.\nThe game implemented a new Health system what I like to call CoD illness. Really annoying and I missed the Medipacks and armor. It wasnt that bad after all but seriously, why did you have to add this feature to a F.E.A.R. game?\nThere is also a new level system which I like to call CoD level illness. You get XP for getting Kill rewards or collecting things. Never liked it but to be honest its not that bad implemented here. With "ranking" up you also get new Skills or upgrades. While playing this game I noticed that this game is pretty much build up for Multiplayer or Coop. Annoyed me a bit to be honest, I hate games where Singleplayer campaigns doesnt feel like Singleplayer campaigns.\nFor me this game was a little bit difficult sometimes, I played on Normal difficulty. But this difficulty was more because of the damn bloodscreen. I hate this and it makes the game hectic.\nThe scare level is a little bit less I have to say but there were still some nice level parts which scared me. Not as many as before though. You are not hunted by Alma in this game anyway. Alma got nearly friendly, I really like how the developers changed Alma. For me she was never that evil anyway, I even liked her. She had just a bad history.\n\n[SPOILER!] (I try to let them out but in this case I have to say it because its a bad thing for me about the game)\nBut what really made me sad is the fact that Alma dies in the end anyway, why letting the main character die like this? If you play the game you know what I mean. A really stupid and wasted death for Alma. I hope her child can offer us a similar experience in F.E.A.R. 4, if it will be ever released. Cant tell actually. Maybe this was the final game. Also Becket dies in a poor and questionable way... WHY? This didnt even make any sense. Especially how they made Becket. I mean the 1-2 minutes he actually appears in a cutscene. Yeah, the character was silent in F.E.A.R. 2 but here they just made him like a poor ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ which wants to end his miserable life. Couldnt they make something more interesting like he teamed up with Alma or something? Its his child after all... Bad decision. They could have made the story so much better.\n\nThe graphics of the game are ok but nothing special. Similar to F.E.A.R. 2s graphics.\n\nIt has to be said that this game was developed by another studio, not Monolith.\nMonolith just provided some help. The main developer was Day 1 Studios.\nNoticeable concerning the changes but wasnt that bad for a indie sort of developer.\n\nI had time to play the campaign in coop with my girlfriend.\nIt was actually a little bit more enjoyable in coop, especially playing with Fettel.\nFirst time I played with him and it was a completely different gameplay.\nYou can actually move into enemies bodies and control them. This is only for a limited time though. But you can extend it with collecting their souls after they die.\nWhen you are not inside of an enemy you can shoot some sort of projectiles from your hand.\nYou can also grab your enemies from far away. I actually had quite some fun playing in Coop.\nIn the end there is a comparison of the statistics of both players and who actually wins the playthrough. This characters ending is played then. I personally felt like Fettel was more powerful than the Pointman. Unbalanced maybe, no clue.\nThis is where the game actually proper shines in my opinion.\nAnd this is actually the only reason for me to replay it sometimes...\nNever the less, Singleplayer is just mediocre.\n\nPostitive:\n- Nice variety of environments in levels\n- Solid shooter gameplay, little bit similar to F.E.A.R. 2s.\n- Some scares, not as many as before\n- Good Coop\n- Fettel is a interesting gameplay character\n\nNegative:\n- Too... Much... CoD...\n- Levels/Ranks useless beside of Coop\n- Questionable story decisions\n- Singleplayer is kinda boring, made for Coop...\n- 5 Hour campaign\n- Graphics outdated (2011)\n- Soundtrack is different and worse\n- Probably the last F.E.A.R. ever... F.E.A.R. Online just made it worse.\n\nReplayability: Only for Coop\n\nWell, thats everything that needs to be said I think.\nF.E.A.R. 3 was a good game for me but with a little bitter taste, especially at the end.\nIt didnt feel like a proper F.E.A.R. anymore. Only replayable for Coop.\nThe story is actually kind of disappointing. The devs totally wasted a lot of potencial here.\nWhy did Monolith give this game away to another developer? Seriously? Actually I feel like they killed the franchise with this action. Or maybe it was WB who wanted to milk the franchise to death?\nI hope you take responsibility for this Monolith or WB. This is how you NOT do it.\nWell, the devs of F.E.A.R. 3 still did somewhat a solid job, even if the end product is far away from the quality of the first 2 F.E.A.R.s.\n\nMy rating would be 6.5/10 points.\nThe other games, except the addons/dlcs got always better ratings.\nI think this is a fair score and I cant give more without feeling to overrate it.","October 24, 2014","true","10.9"," 41 of 72 people (57%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","57","41","72","2","0"

Here are the pros and cons of the PC version.\n\nPros\n\n- Paxton Fettel is really fun to play as with unique and fun interesting paranormal abilities like possession.\n- Has a Co-op campaign\n- A nice achievement and upgrade system\n- You have a nice set of customizable controls with secondary bindings for all functions\n- Nice sound options with multiple sliders\n\nCons\n\n- Simple console like FPS cover based shooting. Press Q then arrows to pop out from cover shoot use bullet time to change cover repeat\n- Instead of mildly tactical squad based combat you push through a crowed, fight a hoard, push through crowd again.\n- Fairly linear with much less alternative routes then the two predecessors\n- The bullet time for point man is essentially useless and just thrown in because it is part of the series\n- Not a great port with some bad low res textures and limited graphics options\n- Super unbalanced Riot shield, find it, win\n- for the price a little too short. Took me almost 7 hours on console to beat\n- Multiplayer is pretty much dead and was tacked on anyway\n- Simple contrived plot\n\n- Adds nothing to the story of the franchise and in fact is kind of an insult to fans not that the other two had great ones, but it doesn’t fit into the universe (if you don’t care about story like me though that doesn’t matter much)\n- Horrible main character ,rugged, scruffy, boring, robotic, bad ♥♥♥, action hero template number 4 instead of the silent protagonist (again you can get past that easily but if that stuff matters to you it will probably disappoint)\n\nMy verdict\n\nGeneric and not worth your time; It is another drop in the sea of mediocrity. Play F.E.A.R or F.E.A.R 2 instead, they are both much better games in every aspect. Unless you get it on a good sale to mess around with as Paxton Fettel it isn’t worth your time or money.","November 21, 2014","false","19.3"," 32 of 56 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","32","56","0","0"

HOWEVER IF YOU LIKE THROWING AWAY MONEY AND PLAYING A BADLY PORTED COD STYLE FPS FOR P_SSIES THAT LIKE TO HIDE BEHIND COVER 90% OF THE TIME I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT.\n\nOK, now that this is said, I shall begin with my full-review of the game.\n\nFirst off, I would like to point out that I have played both F.E.A.R and F.E.A.R 2 and had a blast of a time while playing them. I really loved the style of the games, and I would say that F.E.A.R. 1 is the best out of the entire series.\n\nNow onto F.E.A.R 3 …\nThe game starts with some nice cut-scenes that manage to get me all hyped up to play another F.E.A.R.  game. As soon as these cut-scenes end I get the mission to escape from a prison. At that point I could already tell that the game has a different feel to it, like it wasn’t as dark as the previous games.  But I didn’t care about that and continue playing. So after walking out of my prison cell the game starts explaining the controls and after killing a guard I get my first gun.  Now I am ready to once again become a bad 4ss MOF0 and bust some caps, or so I thought…\n\nNOPE NOPE NOPE.jpeg; As soon as the action starts and I end up in my first shootout the game explains that you need to use\nQ to hide.  Now.. hiding isn’t that bad I mean it’s logical to hide to avoid ending up like Swiss cheese.  But this game brings it to a whole new level, the being a little p_ssy level.  The map is obviously designed so you have to hide behind every other f_cking box. And as soon as you get shot, you lose an unknown amount of health and you can simply regenerate it by hiding for 5 f_cking seconds.\n\nSo where is the challenge to managing your health by using the med kits like in the previous games?  And why are we hiding all the f_cking time, point man used to be a bad 4ss.\n\nOK this is also the moment I start to feel like the game wasn’t developed for the PC and is actually a cheap port. So even with all of that going on I continue my escape from prison whilst encountering several shootouts and getting annoyed about the whole continuously hiding behind boxes and having the unnatural feeling of playing a bad port.  This goes on for a while and I finally decide that this game is a piece of sh!t.. and I got better games to play.\n\nSo how did the fear series end up with this piece of sh!t? It’s because this game wasn’t even developed by the same company that developed the initial fear games.  NOPE not developed by Monolith but by Day 1 Studios.\n\nAnyhow thank the seven gods that I bought this game in a steam sale and did not have to pay full price. Because after just about 15 minutes of play time I decided it was a piece of sh_t and uninstalled the game. And I didn’t even get to die once.. So I guess you are practically immortal in this game as long as you hide behind boxes.","January 12, 2014","false","0.5"," 12 of 18 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","12","18","0","1"

I loved the insane action, slow-motion roundhouse kicks and bodies exploding into Jell-O(tm) when you pumped a shell into them. I loved the freaky-deaky story, the mysterious protagonist(s) and the occasional flirt with enigmatic storytelling, the screeching, violin-falling-down-the-stairs soundtrack that worked in all its beautiful discordance and hair-raising abruptness. The scripted scares wove ladders, hallways, doors and windows into shockingly intricate little spookouts that contrasted with the bombastic shootouts that framed them, and it all just worked out so WELL. Hell, even the ending of the second game was pretty good in my eyes.\n\nAnd then this game. Oh boy.\n\nI hardly know what to say about it, and I hardly have the energy- even now- to summon a full-blown rant on this marvelous marvelous deconstruction of a once-great shooter franchise. The scares? Gone. The lonesome eeriness? Gone. Hope you like playing co-operatively with your psychic *** brother who has lost all of his charm now that you can see how he works and he's always trotting along beside you like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ doberman. The Half-Life-esque presentation that kept you in the protagonist's perspective constantly and almost never thrust you into immersion-punching cutscenes? Hope you didn't like them, because apparently neither did WB. Did I mention that this game isn't scary?\nIt gets most of the action from previous titles right, but it's more than just lacking in the horror department. The game called... CALLED... 'Fear'?

It has been abandonned im comparison to previous titles, which is a huge let down for fans of VR.\nIt is overall a great coop experience. If you play merely solo, I would say there are plenty of better FPS. If you like the F.E.A.R. universe, do not get too much disappointed that the game is not that scary.

I enjoyed the fast pace combat, but it took out all stragity that made the first and second games a hard deal, you actual had to plan out your combat route, know when to use slow-mo, and keep ur wits on guard, Playing as paxton can be pretty fun aswell, as it's a diffrent kinda play to the Series. slo-mo in F.E.A.R. 3 had sometimes almost no propose because by time u use it, its gone already, F.E.A.R. 3 compared to the others had minimum to no horror aspect, no dark atmosphere, and quite frankly, the story line was poor and kinda boring. they tried to escalate the matter of the situation, without telling us why it's happening. Taking out the replica forces made NO sense to me, and they never Evan explain why there not there, i mean they were in 2, and still being controlled, so why not in 3, and why the ♥♥♥♥ is point man in captivity when at the end of F.E.A.R. 1 he escaped with his team. F.E.A.R. 3 has beautiful graphics, smooth game play, brutal combat, and an interesting Ranking system. As for story line, atmosphere, tone, and excitability, it was a huge let down, i have to say by far F.E.A.R. 2 was the best in the series. F.E.A.R. 3 just feels more like call of duty when it trys to be creepy. this is a great stand alone game, esp for FPS fans, but for personal fans of the F.E.A.R. Series as a whole, this is just a disappointment. hopefully, if they make another game, they will try to make it less "Call of dutyish" and return to the Dark, disturbing, amazing storyline that F.E.A.R. use to be. What they gained in making fast paced action game play, made it less horror, and less stragidy and more just shoot shoot shoot. and where are my martial arts melee attacks that were so fun to pull off. like i said though, good standalone game, but with the F.E.A.R. logo, its a let down\nStandalone game: 7/10\nF.E.A.R.

Everything seems mechanically better, graphics and realism have both stepped up a notch. It soon becomes apparent, though,  that the story really is getting old - it just lacks mystery and suspense.\n\nTo make matters worse, the game seems to have completely missed the mark on the horror side. It tries to scare, but just doesn't. Towards the end of the game you start to get tired of boring story sequences interrupting the action!\n\nSo what are you left with? Well, a good urban warfare shooter, albeit a little short.  It still comes highly recommended, but I'm afraid that if you have expectations for this game being a "horror", you will feel let down.

Fear 3 is the 3rd and probably most unique installment of this franchise. I am wondering if this should be considered the last one or WB is planning to publish another episode sometime in the near future.\n\nIn Fear 2 we skipped the story of the good old Point Man, our protagonist from the 1st episode, and now we pick up his tale from where we were left off. Paxton also returns and this gives a game a unique experience as coop campaign is now available. Paxton can jump into enemies and take over them for a short period of time. On his own he is rather weak but once you possess a soldier you can use his weapons and should you be eliminated you can quickly find another host.\n\nSequences with the Mech also return and they are more devastating than ever. There are more monsters now so it seems the developers upped the horror-like nature of the game a bit. Single player is relatively long and with the 2nd protagonist (Paxton) you have replayability here which is good news.\n\nThe field where Fear 3 really shines is multiplayer. There are various game modes out there that are interesting and challenging, too. In F**king Run, for example, you are running away from a wall that means instant death once it reaches you. While running away you also need to eliminate the oncoming waves of enemies and cooperation is a must as if anybody from your team is caught by the wall that's game over for the entire group.\n\nI liked Fear 3. For me the best is the 2nd episode in this trilogy but the 3rd installment also offered an exciting action-horror experience and while I do not really favour the approach of releasing more and more sequels for a game I would be delighted to play a possible 4th episode.","March 27, 2014","true","24.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The campaign is very short and can be finished in less than 4 hours. Unlike the first installment, this game is not worth buying just for solo experience.\n\nEven if you do manage to find someone to play with, you would probably experience a lot of problems (like lag and desync) which stem from bad netcode and unoptimized load management.\n\nThe only good thing about this game is its sophisticated A.I. which honestly, is one of the best I've played against. But again, it was the same case with F.E.A.R. 1 as well.\n\nOther than that, level design is uninspiring and story is boring. If you're looking for about 4 hours of solo content, go ahead and buy it. Otherwise, buy the first installment. F.E.A.R. 1 is one of the best games ever made.","January 4","false","5.1"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

Unlike the first 2 FEAR games, FEAR 3 has one of those regenerating health systems where you just hide under cover for a few seconds and you recover back to full health. No need to scrounge for med kits or armor. Also, the game seems built around 2 player co-op, which I like in first person shooter games (when I have someone to play with).\n\n*Spoilers ahead*\nFEAR 3 takes place an unspecified amount of time after the events of FEAR 2. Alma is pregnant and getting ready to give birth, as a result her psychic power is tearing up the city (possibly the world). Again the main opposition is the private military contractor Armacham, who seems to have become 100x more powerful than they were in the first games. Even without their clone super soldiers from the first games, Armacham seems capable of overrunning and occupying entire cities with soldiers, aircraft, and power armor. You play the Point Man protagonist from the first FEAR game (the guy you play in FEAR 2 also shows up briefly) but this time you have an “imaginary” friend Paxton Fettel (Bad guy from the first game). Your primary goal this time around is to reach Alma before she gives birth and deal with her once and for all. Unfortunately for you, Alma’s psychic pain has summoned nightmare creatures and twisted the surviving civilian population into crazed psychos.\n\nUnlike the previous FEAR games, FEAR 3 is broken down into missions or “levels” with each mission giving you a point score at the end. You gain points by finding collectables, killing enemies, and completing “challenges.” The challenges are similar to the “Skill shots” in Bulletstorm, where it’s basically just using various methods of killing. For example, 2000 points for killing enemies with a specific weapon, or 1000 points for getting 25 headshots, or 2000 points for getting 3 backstabs. The points aren’t just for show, by the way. You “level up” when you gain enough points and each level gives you some kind of perk, such as +10% health or +bullet capacity. You can replay levels as many times as you want to “grind” for points. This means that the game will get easier over time as you replay it. You might notice that when you first start the game, it seems far more difficult than the previous ones, well this changes as you level up and get stronger. The regenerating health means you can charge groups of enemies and just duck for cover when your screen is almost completely red (near death). Healing is free unlike FEAR 1 and 2 which had limited med kits.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, the game is built with 2 player co-op in mind. At the end of each mission there is a ranking between the 2 players to see who scored highest in several categories. The game’s ending depends on which of the two characters “won” the most missions. Of course if you’re playing single player the character you’re playing (Fettel or Point Man) will “win” every level you complete. Point Man’s gameplay is the same as the previous games (standard shooter with Slow-Mo power), But Fettel is a psychic commander. This means he can possess enemies and use them to fight (he doesn’t have slow-mo). Every time he takes over a new body he gets the weapons of the possessed enemy, so you can’t hoard powerful weapons or grenades the way Point Man does. You can only hold 2 weapons now, unlike 3 weapons in FEAR 1 and 4 weapons in FEAR 2. Possession also means you won’t be able to use the awesome power armors because the possessed body won’t last long enough.\n\nPros:\n+Excellent graphics and visuals. Large variety of weapons available.\n+Some cool new enemies, particular the Phase Commander and Phase Caster.\n+A lot of replay value. I just finished the game and immediately restarted as Fettel.\n+2 player co-op available. Also a bunch of various multiplayer game modes I haven’t tried.\n\nCons:\n-The game is very short, about 6 hours to beat the first time. Replay is strongly encouraged though.\n-The story is weaker than the first FEAR games. There’re a lot of unnecessary “dream sequences” that don’t seem to add much. You just walk forward about 15 seconds with someone talking in voice over and it ends.\n-I get the feeling that the enemies are much “dumber” than FEAR 1 enemies. They tend to stick behind the same piece of cover and just pop their heads out to shoot from there.\n\nOverall I think the game is well worth playing for fans of First Person Shooters and people who want to see how the FEAR story ends. Once you finish a mission in single player, the Fettel character is unlocked so you can try playing him for that particular level. The way to see the Fettel game ending is by playing through the game a second time (or play the game in co-op and Fettel has the highest score every mission). One thing I noticed is that the game’s Steam achievements seem to be half for multiplayer, and not many people are playing the multiplayer. This isn’t surprising since the game has been out for a few years. I’ll probably only be able to get about 45% completion for the game achievements by myself.","January 16, 2015","true","154.5"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","7","10","0","0"

It's nowhere near as memorable as the previous game in the series. The campaign story is confusing and uninteresting. Scary events aren't really scary. There's co-op mode around this time though, which helps. There's also four different multiplayer modes, which I haven't played much, but they feel slapped on. I'd say they are okay, but nothing more. I'm not sure what else to say. Not a particularly good game, but an ok co-op shooter. I'm leaning more towards the negative side than the positive side, so it's a thumbs down from me. Consider getting it if it's cheap.","April 14","false","7.8"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","8","12","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Paddles93/recommended/21100/","Paddles93","[TPZ] Cereal Killer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Paddles93/","219 products in account","About The Games:\nThe F.E.A.R franchise has always been & always will be a game about "The Paranormal" expect a lot of Ghosts in each of the games more so in F.E.A.R 1 & 2. That generally has a solid story line and to be expected in a game about the paranormal plenty of gore & jump scares THESE ARE NOT BAD THINGS!\n\nF.E.A.R had you playing in the shoes of an unknown solider for the "First Encounter Assault Recon Team" or F.E.A.R for short, you went in and you were tasked to capture a test subject who was designed to control these "Super Soldiers" for a war. The project was a success except things went wrong & the leader went nutso & so you're here to clean up the mess.\n\nF.E.A.R 2 had you playing the role of another solider for the "First Encounter Assault Recon" who was in another squad & was deployed just before the ♥♥♥♥ hits the fan in the first game, you were tasked to find & capture a doctor who was working on the test subject & then you are to eliminate the test subject & attempt to shut down project Origin by eliminate the main "Ghost" who was causing all the mayhem around the city, unfortunatly things don't pan out so well & then ♥♥♥♥ hits the fan & of course once more you're trying to battle your way out of the storm.\n\nF.E.A.R 3 on the other hand has you go back into the shoes of the "Unknown Soldier" from F.E.A.R 1 along with the ghost of your brother Paxton Fettle who was the test subject they were developing to control the "Super Soldiers" & use it for the war. The story fell really flat here & it certainly wasn't as much of an enjoyable game as the first 2 were.\n\nThe Review:\nF.E.A.R 3 offers VERY minimal satisfaction for returning fans of the original games or for Single Player gamers as it's lost everything that made the first 2 F.E.A.R games great & on edge spooky, there's very little in the way of scary scenes & there's certainly not a solid story line here as there were more with F.E.A.R 1 & F.E.A.R 2.\n\nWhat F.E.A.R 3 does offers us is a very solid CO-OP experience with friends, there's some very EXCELLENT game modes, and Story is a blast to play with a partner to add some excellent gameplay mechanics,\n\nStory CO-OP:\n1 thing F.E.A.R 3 got right was the CO-OP experience you get while playing Story.\n\n1 Player plays as a Ghost that can use all kinds of ghostly powers & telekenetics to dispatch of the foes, this includes:\nPossession of Enemies to use as stealth bait (Can flank enemies & then shoot them in the back so long as you don't fire at them first or get spotted body snatching)\nTelekenetic Smashes\nGhostly Blasts, etc\n\nWhile the other player uses Firearms & Slow Motion reflexes to eleminate his foes as the F.E.A.R opperative.\n\nEach player gets to do different things in order to help you progress in the story so you're constantly helping each other out in order to get to the next section, this improves the games experience so i recommend playing CO-OP with a friend in order to get the most out of your game experience.\n\nCO-OP Multiplayer Modes:\nMoving onto the CO-OP Multiplayer experience we get some really fun CO-OP Modes such as:\n\n♥♥♥♥ing RUN!,\nThis game mode is a fun & fresh addition to bring something new & creative to a multiplayer game mode, it's kind of like a Death Run, you're given about 30 seconds to get a head start before something dark begins chasing you from behind & if you fall too far behind or stop too long at sections for a shootout with the pursueing enemies you'll get wiped out & then you're stuck watching to see if your team can survive. (Sounds boring on paper but once you get into a game, it becomes suspenceful & interesting to see if you're fast enough to escape).\n\nSurvival Mode:\nThis game mode is a classic game mode, survive the waves of enemies for as long as you can & try to best your friends or help them out & get the best top score together. (There's nothing quite like a good team building experience for me, i just enjoy the good old Survival)\n\nMultiplayer Modes:\nNow onto the Multiplayer Modes here's nothing new we have our usual game modes such as:\nDeathmatch\nLast Man Stand\n\nNothing ground breaking or exciting here, Multiplayer is pretty well dead & you may or may not find the occasional server here or there. I recommend just playing with friends who may also enjoy the CO-OP experience or maybe a friendly Deathmatch with a group of friends.\n\nThe Verdict:\n\nFinally it all boils down to my final conclusion of this game & sad to say that it's not a good one.\n\nI'll admit that it's impossible to say i did not have any fun in this game because i did have some fun, it's just not a game to play for it's Story or for the Single Player experience. This game thrives on it's obviously designed CO-OP experience that the developers had planned from the moment they started making F.E.A.R 3.\n\nThis game is also very obviously ported from a Console so expect some very average controls for the PC & also very average Graphics.\n\nIf you're looking for a more satisfying Single Player or Horror experience i very, VERY, whole heartedly suggest you look at F.E.A.R 1 or F.E.A.R 2 or even both of these games, this is because they are more enjoyable for the Single Player experience & for the Gameplay, Story & on edge Horror of the Single Player mode that'll keep you from rounding the next corner for a while.\n\nThe Rating:\nThis game receives a 4/10.  This is because of a few different factors\n\nIt has a very poor Story & for a game that started off so well in this department it's just not justifyable, it seems like the Developers just said after F.E.A.R 2 released "Oh ♥♥♥♥ the story let's just slap together the final installment & hope to god somebody buys it"\n\nSingle Player has lost all meaning now, there's no scary scenes or suspenceful moments, it's all about the gun play & it's very baddly played, you're going to much more enjoy the Campaign with a friend simply because of that unique and amazing gameplay experience you get from playing as or with a Ghosly helper.\n\nHorror is almost non-existant anymore, this franchise started off SOOOOO thick with spooky and scary elements & it really made me want to stop playing at certain times because of the feeling i got everytime i saw a shadow or light flicker on the corner of the screen or when a ghost popped out behind a wall and started whispering creepy ♥♥♥♥ to me.\n\nFocus on run & gun play, the final nail in the coffin if not just because they removed what made the game so unique and scary was fear of the unknown, now just leaves fear of the "Oh what do i shoot next", there's no longer any great moments of anticipation of when will the next ghost decide to show itself or oh god when does the next shootout happen, now it's just shootout, after shootout, after shootout, and it really never stops.\n\nAnd with all this stuff out of the way i need to ask myself the question. "Do i recommend this to anyone else?"\n\nDo I Recommend This Game?:\nThis would have to be a NO! I don't recommend this to anybody who loved the first 2 games of the franchise & i certainly don't recommend it to people who love horror, BUT! I can however recommend this game only to those who seek a unique and quite fun CO-OP experience with friends, i can only recommend it for these people.\n\nFurther Reading:\n\nCheck out my Review on F.E.A.R 2: Project Origin: http://steamcommunity.com/id/Paddles01/recommended/16450/","May 17, 2014","false","32.2"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zorder/recommended/21100/","zorder","Zorder","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zorder/","2002 products in account","I always heard bad things about F.E.A.R. 3 and the first few hours of me playing it gave me all I need to make my own opinion about the game. If you're a fan of the original F.E.A.R. you turn back right now, otherwise you'll most likely loose your admiration for this franchise. To be honest I didn't really liked F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin as much as I liked the first F.E.A.R. game and it's expansions, it did have the F.E.A.R. feel to it but for me it wasn't as good as the original. But now, F.E.A.R. 3 is where they've messed up everything, everything I liked about the previous games was gone. First, there's no medkits or reflex boosts on the game because you now have regenerating health and you unlock levels, and yes I do mean actual ingame levels, by scoring points, I feel like they tried making F.E.A.R. 3 a kinda of score attack game but making it similar to modern first person shooters. So, if there's no medkits and reflex boosts there's not that much of incentive to go through each level exploring and trying to find hidden stuff to make your life easier... but then again they've changed that, most of the hidden stuff that you can now find in F.E.A.R. 3 are corpses which you can "connect to" and gain points by doing so and also finding some weird little statues that I also believe that give you points. Everytime you level up you can gain an increase to HP, increased time that you can use your slow time and increased ammo for each gun. I pretty much hate when developers nowadays make first person shooters with regenerating health because that basicly just means that everytime you're on low health you just need to get behind a wall and wait for your health to regenerate which I find to be somewhat, dumb. And now the guns. I thought that the shooting from F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin was easier than the original F.E.A.R. but hell did they make it Call of Duty style on F.E.A.R. 3, you can pretty much just spray and pray with any gun without aiming down sights and you'll still get the kills even in long range with a shotgun, I realize that this might be appealing to some people out there but for a guy like me who likes guns to have a real kick to them and feel authentic when shooting and having the need to compensate recoil and spray patterns I find this Call of Duty style of gun handling to be really frustrating, so what's a first person shooter with shooting that people don't like?, yeah. And now, the story, maybe it was just me but I had the feeling during the whole game that the game was trying to shove you the story all the time, I didn't really get much of it and also they did it in kind of a weird way. I think F.E.A.R. 3 was designed as a co-op game because everytime there's a cutscene, and yes there's now cutscenes on a F.E.A.R. game, it's always the two brothers talking and by the time it ends you have the feeling that you're supposed to start a mission with you and your brother fighting the "bad guys" but no, there's just one of you there, and I find that to be rather weird because a few seconds ago there were two people there, couldn't they just put the other brother as an AI companion? One thing I certainly have to mention is that the enemy AI, mainly the soldiers is pretty well made, everytime you try to get behind cover they try to flank you while others distract you by providing supressive fire and enemies usually always go looking for cover as soon as they spot you and they even flip furniture in order to get cover behind it. The last thing I really hated about F.E.A.R. 3 and I'm sure many people will agree with me on this, is that the game despite looking pretty damn good it isn't scary at all, the F.E.A.R. franchise was supposed to be abunch of scary first person shooters with some paranormal elements and that ocurred in the previous game but in this one it kinda turned into a demonic invasion, creatures spawning from the walls through some kind of portals and at the end nothing pretty much made any sense to me, for me F.E.A.R. 3 looked more like fighting a demonic invasion other than fighting horror  and Alma and they pretty much failed on the scary and tense component from the previous games. The first F.E.A.R. was very tense and spooky, F.E.A.R. 2 was not that much but it still had some tense sections and some ocasional jumpscares while F.E.A.R. 3 is just a run and gun shooter. As you can clearly see I did not liked F.E.A.R. 3 at all, it is certainly a good game but not what I expected from a F.E.A.R. game. If you're a fan of the F.E.A.R. franchise I advise you not to play this or only playing it if you're curious about the story but if you haven't played any of the F.E.A.R. games you might enjoy your time with this one, I don't know honestly. Personally I don't recommend this one.","January 2, 2014","false","6.7"," 15 of 26 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","15","26","0","0"

Also the story writing goes further down the trash bin, personally letting me down as I am a die hard fan of the original F.E.A.R. and admittedly enjoyed F.E.A.R. 2. However taking a thriller/shooter and casualizing the game play to CoD style truly took the games identity away. I have lost all hope of this game coming back to its original stature.

It gave up a lot of the interesting design of the first two for a rather bland, run-of-the-mill first person shooter experience. Levels were reduced to little more than straight corridors with things to hide behind and seemed to drag on longer than they should have as enemies filled choke points. Most of the guns felt uninspired compaired to guns from the first two and the weapon limit (brought over from 2, which was a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ part of that game) didnt help at all. The worst part though is the wasted opportunity of a second playable character in the form of Paxton Fettel. So many more interesting gameplay mechanics could have been introduced in his powers, but we only got a stun blast attack and the ability to posses someone, which is basically just like playing as Point Man. I only really played this to see the conclusion of the story, which wasn't that great really, so I cant really recommend this on any level. (single player wise anyway, never tried the multiplayer).","January 28, 2014","false","6.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","1"

F.E.A.R. 3 uses similar mechanics from the original and its sequel, but still offers a fun adventure although with less emphasis on the story and a shorter campaign. However, you can play as either Point Man or Paxton Fettel in a single playthrough in the campaign - each with their own unique abilities. F.E.A.R. 3, basically, is a great game for acheivement hunters since many of them are fun and not too challenging.","September 8, 2011","true","14.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/endlesspersonalandbruh/recommended/21100/","endlesspersonalandbruh","MelodicChirps","http://steamcommunity.com/id/endlesspersonalandbruh/","48 products in account","Okay, I am going to get right into this and say that F.E.A.R. 3 is a BAD game, but it is only a BAD game to people who have played the other games. If you've played the other F.E.A.R. games, you understand why this game is the bane of our existance, but, if not, I shall explain it to you.\n\nAlright, F.E.A.R. and F.E.A.R. 2: Project origin were both made by the same company and in the same style. They had large maps that you could get lost in and unnerving environments. Monolith was NOT afraid to hit you with a scare that comes across as mild, though is nothing compaired to the rest of the game, but it get's you anyway, probably even more than the really big scares. It was the small things that kept people on edge for the duration of your play time. The characters were well thought out and they were in no way scared to be brutal. They slapped you with a psychic canibal clone commander from the start who blew through innocent men and woman to get to the people who tortured and killed his mother who was forced into carrying to children via clone fetus implant. Yeah... Pretty sick stuff.\n\nThe Problem with F.E.A.R. 3, however, was, not only the fact that the developer who made it KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT HORROR, but also the fact that it was so pointless and soul-crushing that it totally went in the OPPOSITE DIRECTION of what the original creators wanted. Day 1 RUINED F.E.A.R. by turning it into a light, CHEAP, co-op, FPS hell. They almost entirely removed the horror aspect of the game and handed us one of the biggest loads of trash. The problems are as follows.\n\n1. Going by the story line of the previous games, the ending was anti-climactic and a serious let down.\n\n2. The horror aspect it an attempt to use wierd sounds and over-cooked map textures to scare people as well as cheap jumpscares that would hardly startle a small infant.\n\n3. They changed the characters to a fault. The two biggest examples being the Characters Paxton Fettel and Point Man. Paxton had always been propper and rightfully creepy simply by the way he delivered his lines and their context. He now speaks in partial slang and comes across more annoying with his lines than his former eree. Point Man was originally personality-less, intended to be that way by the company that was implimenting his make-shift powers. They didn't want him to have a personality. This also helped the immersion of the game by allowing the player to impliment themselves onto the character. NOW, Point Man has a very angry and cliche silent-protagonist role, comming across as an overused-"badass" steriotype.\n\n4. CUTSCENES. The other games had little to no cutscenes. What few they had were all in first person and allowed the player some range of head movement. In F.E.A.R. 3, however, the cutscenes are full on thirdperson with no choice, no point, and do little to advance the story. If anything, they just annoy the player. (Paxton's cheesy jokes don't help any.) This also breaks the immersion charm that the F.E.A.R. games were known for.\n\n5. The story is dead. Yes, they continue on from the last game involving Alma's third child, but hardly any of the game is even about that. You play a "must save the princess" sort of game with the Character Jin sun-qwan who can't seem to keep away from trouble, but was a total badass in the other games. She didn't need to be saved and was a good ally. In this game, she even has the gall to be annoyingly bossy, something I quite detest, especially seeing as her voice actor get's very ear-clenching after level two. They also make sure to kill off the Protagonist from F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin in an unessisarily brutal way and give him a voice, though he had none in his own game (Though I wonder HOW IN THE HELL THIS GAME GOT AHOLD OF ROBIN ATKIN DOWNS.)\n\n6. They play Alma as a completely innocent little girl, running from the tyrant that was her father. Alma was, in no way, innocent. She was an evil, demonic spirit who killed many to get what she wanted and even mind-♥♥♥♥♥ her youngest son to get it, making HIM kill many people as well at age 10 and again at age 30. Another thing to note is that Harlon Wade did some bad things, but, as it is shown in F.E.A.R. 2, was reluctant to do said things to Alma, but did because he thought they were for the better. He certainly loved Alma, though she did kill him, and was clouded in judgement by those of the Armacham corperation. A spirirt such as his could not have come back as a demon, let a long one with so much power over the surviving family.\n\n7. Inconsistantcy. Paxton's role in this game, on its own, is an inconsistancy. Not only is he a ghost, which he shouldn't be due to him gaining a new body off of a clone in the DLC for F.E.A.R. 2, Reborn, but he seems to like becoming visible and invisible to anyone but Point Man at any given time. What I mean by this is: During the cutscenes, the game shows that Paxton is totally invisible to anyone but his brother, but, in combat and totally BAD times, he is visible to the world and can be harmed by bullets, though in some scenes it is depicted that bullets have no effect on him, which leads no another problem when, in Point Man's ending, he stops Fettel by shooting him. I know what they were trying to do in paying  respect to the first game, but with the way they loused it all up, it just doesn't work.\n\n8. (Finally) The endings. In Point Man's ending, he shoots Paxton in the head, delivers Alma's baby, then leaves with it. (I've already explained the two problems with this ending.) and In Paxton's ending, he possesses his brother, delivers the baby, then eats his own mother, claiming it'll give him the power to take over the world, which, isn't just cliche, but NEVER HIS GOAL IN THE FIRST PLACE. Paxton's goal was always to avenge his mother and serve her. Now he wants world domination. What in the... Never mind... I digress...","June 12, 2015","false","70.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

The push towards console gaming is made even more apparant with the 3rd iteration in the FEAR franchise, a game that completely abandons everything that made the original such a classic. The gameplay has been oversimplified and while it's cliche to say it's like a "COD" game now, it quite literally is. I'm not exactly sure why this game is even called "FEAR" because this game was less scary than Octodad. The story is completely idiotic it could easily be compared to something like Sharknado. And the graphics have suffered a significant amount, looking worse than the original game that came out almost a decade before it. Let's talk about the gameplay in more detail though...\n\nFirst off, the game is much more fast paced. You're given the ability to sprint, slide, vault, and worst of all, "take cover." This game mechanic is so incredibly annoying. Basically if you are near any vertical surface and decide you want to crouch, the game will automatically snap you to cover. This will lock you into position until you hit the crouch button again, meaning you have to stand up in the middle of a firefight just to relocate your position. The game also offers a new and completely unnecessary "ranking" system that constantly gives you these big cheesy notifications whenever you kill a certain amount of enemies in a row with headshots or something. This franchise is about walking around in dark hallways, shooting enemies in slow motion, and being scared silly by some creepy girl in the shadows. FEAR 3 seems to have forgotten all of that. Every level in the game seems to take place in broad daylight, and even when you do go inside a dark building, the ambient lighting is so bright you can see the terrible textures in every dark corner. Now don't get me wrong, the gunplay is more fun than it has ever been, but because of this focus on improving combat, the game's identity has been completely lost. Even the few times that you do see the creepy girl "Alma," it's almost comical... like seeing her riding on the opposite escalator, looking confused as to why she no longer was scaring me. Another major downside to the game is the most immediate thing you'll probably notice, "health regen." That's right, they finally did away with the classic refreshing "health-kits" that make games so much more intense and opted for the "COD" approach where you can inhale bullets, take cover for half a second, and then jump out from cover good as new. This along with the near endless supply of ammo for every gun has taken away any type of suspense left in this game. I was able to cruise through this game without any real problems at all in less than half the time it took me to beat the original FEAR. So while the game is fast-paced and fun shooter by itself, FEAR fans will want to avoid this entirely due to the complete lack of horror.\n\nNow let's talk about the story. It sucks. It's just so painfully bad. Basically it starts off with the stupid ending from FEAR 2 where ALMA somehow rapes a guy (yes... according to the FEAR developers, a woman can now ♥♥♥♥ a man) and is now pregnant and going into labor. In FEAR 3, you take on the role of the original character, who I guess is named "Point-Man" and are tasked with trying to stop ALMA from having this evil baby. Your brother that you shot in the head in the first game is somehow, without explanation, back... and is now constantly on your shoulder the entire game, spoiling all of the mystery and suspense behind everything that happens. "Uh oh.. sounds like ALMA is here, she's probably going to jump out at you brother!" your brother will say as you walk into a new area. In addition to his terrible voice acting, your forced to listen to these frustrating loud screams that are supposed to be ALMA going into labor, but just sound like poorly done fake ♥♥♥♥♥♥ sounds and they sound absolutely ridiculous. Thankfully this train-wreck of a story ends quickly, with some completley random and unexplained player rank-based ending that I guess is affected by how well you played throughout the game? You're never given any warning about this so it was really confusing once I reached the end. If you're a fan of FEAR's storyline, I suggest you avoid this... avoid this like the plague. You're better off watching Alien 4 or something...\n\nGraphics are another pretty big deal when it comes to FEAR games. The original FEAR was one of the best looking games available in its time with revolutionary physics, shadows, and fantastic lighting. FEAR 3 is quite the opposite. I'm surprised games post-2010 can even look this bad. The lighting is all static, with hardly any dynamic nature at all to the environment in any sense (meaning no more cool slow motion physics based destruction). The gore is laughable, with enemies just exploding into tiny blood shaded explosions when you shoot them with a shotgun, and even on the highest possible settings, the texture resolutions were just painful to look at. The FEAR franchise has certainly fallen from grace in the graphics department.\n\nIt's frustrating seeing a franchise die so quickly with obvious shifts towards a more action oriented, COD friendly consumer base, and the FEAR franchise is a perfect example of this. What once was a hardcore, scary, action shooter with no health-regen and some impressive visuals has now turned into a Call of Duty game with a different franchise's logo pasted onto the cover. FEAR 3's gameplay is fun, fast paced, and hectic, but this just wasn't a necessary change. The game's horror has been completely abandoned and the storyline feels like an afterthought. This along with the games lazy graphic design are all reasons I just simply can't recommend buying this game. Maybe if the entire franchise is on sale it's worth it for a short afternoon killing spree, but I wouldn't expect much that's for sure.","October 4, 2014","false","0.5"," 21 of 39 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","21","39","0","0"

There aren't too many secrets or loots to find. So it's pretty pretty linear.\n\nGraphic is good with some good effects, but let's be honest...for the scenarios sometimes the textures could be better...even if the final result is still pretty cool\n\nNice arsenal of weapon to use but....they really satisfy us?...\n\nThe gore level, as you expect from a game like FEAR, is really really high. You will easly see ripped body parts flying all over your screen...but....not everyone likes that...\n\nThe longevity....well....that's a huge no no no....even if we play at the highest difficulty the game will still be too much easy and too much short. Ok if we finish the game with Point Man (the only character we can use in single player the first time) we will unlock Fettel. So we can play the game again as Fettel with a total different combat system (Point Man is a soldier...Fettel is an undead man with psychicl powers...yes fun to use but...is that enough?),\n\nSo what's the good point if we like the FEAR series?\nThe coop indeed! Ok this will make the game even more shorter (two peeps is better than one alone...) but at least you will always have a bit of fun because as always, playing togheter is better than playing alone.\n\nSo if you are a FEAR fan and you have a friend (or a girlfriend/boyfriend) to play with....go ahead and buy the game!\n\nIf you are looking for a good co-op game and you are not into FEAR...well....skip this game...there is better out there!\n\nOverall:\n\nGraphic 6/10\nSounds 8/10\nGameplay 6/10\nLongevity 4/10\nFun 5/10 (alone) 7/10 (Co-op)","March 17, 2014","true","5.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The story is bland, but picks up after the 1st/2nd game. But the leveling system in the campaign, the "slow-mo" effect you love to use, and overall combat, is just stupid FPS fun. The game is also short, so while at risk for being reptitive, it can be beaten in 1 sitting. Play this game with a friend if you can, and you're sure to have a good time. The diversity of game mechanics between the brothers, while not completely different, is a nice attempt to see. One brother can slow down time, while the other can possess enemies.

It's just too bad it went more action, over the "F.E.A.R." we were given from the first.\n\nAlso, this game doesn't give a fug. Some of the things that happen in the story, is just ridiculous.

Die Spieleserie wurde zu einem reinen Shooter heruntergewirtschaftet und der eingebaute "Horror" ist eine blanke Lächerlichkeit. Zu allem Überfluss lässt die Story zu wünschen übrig und die beiden Endings, die man erhalten kann, lassen mehr Fragen offen, als beantwortet werden.\n\nWenn man ein Shooter-Liebhaber ist und gerne lineare Storylines ohne mehr als Herumgeballere spielt und auch glaubt, dass Horror nur aus Blut und Explosionen von Menschen besteht, wenn man ein Achievementhunter ist und auf Scores achtet, dem würde ich es zweifelsohne empfehlen. Wenn euch jedoch die F.E.A.R.-Reihe am Herzen liegt: kauft euch F.E.A.R. 3 nicht.

This is more of an action game with some suspense but lacking the same atmosphere of the previous titles. Same as Dead Space 3 that way.\n\nThat being said this is a very enjoyable and action packed shooter. The game offers a great deal of diversity when it comes to levels, the enemy types are not so diverse but still enjoyable to fight against. The world itself is the same as the previous games so I had a great time just looking around at the psychic cataclysms that was Fairpoint.\n\nThe characters were the same as the first game, one brother insane the other silent but that didn’t detract. The story was fairly good and I did want to see what happened at the end, it does follow on from the second one so I’d recommend playing that one first unless you just want action then this one is the best bet.\n\nI liked this game a lot, it was not what I was expecting but it was great none the less. Plus if you replay it you can be Fettel and have a great time making people explode with your mind. There are also a lot of multiplayer modes available, I didn’t try them but they did look like good fun.\n\nOver all I recommend this if it’s on sale and you like action and a little horror.\n\nHave fun ^_^","July 3, 2014","true","34.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I played this game before playing F.E.A.R. 1, it's DLC's or 2, and while I do recommend it, there are several large caveats and it's a tentative recommendation.\n\nPros:\n- Looks pretty good, nothing extraordinary though\n- Co-op is fun\n- Multiplayer is pretty alright\n- Story was fairly interesting to me, if rather cliched. But perhaps it only interested me because I had no idea what was going on....ever.\n- Gameplay is ok\n- Multiple endings\n\nCons:\n- 5 hours long, I was bloody awful at it and my co-op partner carried us, we respawned a LOT and it still only took us about 5 and a half hours.\n- Extremely linear, linearity isn't bad but Fear 3's linearity is similar to being on rails\n- Co-op gameplay is lopsided. Pointman's gameplay is well worn and honestly sort of boring but much easier, or Paxton, who has gameplay that's more fun yet not nearly as solid, it's much easier to do well in the grading system each mission insists on as Pointman as opposed to Paxton\n- Not horror, like not even a little.\n- MP servers are dead in the water\n- Repetitive gameplay\n- Questionable AI(at times)\n- Just mediocre, neither the graphics, nor the story, nor the non-existent horror help this game stand out.\n\nNow, did I have fun with it? Yeah i did, but more in the vein of it being a fun co-op shooter with a fairly interesting premise instead of it being a Fear game. I'd expected something else and got a fairly fun co-op shooter that's easy to shoot through.\n\nI recommend this to Die-heard FEAR fans, but even then only if it's on steep discount. Otherwise with the amount of other quality games that come out, buying this game for 20 dollars isn't worth it.\n\n","January 5, 2015","true","5.4"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

Atmospheric horror shooting with two characters from which to choose – each for different playing style. Good graphics and tactical advancement. Also, F.E.A.R.3 has one of the most reasonable achievement system on Steam. The balanced, fast-paced gameplay and intriguing story will keep you going from the beginning until the end for the first walktrough, which takes only about 6-7 hours. But it's not a problem. After the first time, you can take the other character or try multiplayer. Still feels great.\n\nThe multiplayer is ok, but nothing exciting.\n\nDespite some managable technical problems, it's one of my favourite games.\nOverall rating: 10/10.\n\nNB!There are few technical tweaks you should know, before you play this game.\n\n1. First, rename ClientRegistry.blob file to ClientRegistryOld.blob (Steam folder). This might save you from kicking out, when there are too many players on server (happens around sales time).\n2. Manually adjust the FOV, by opening the options.cfg file (game folder) and deleting the # tag and changing value to 85.

Я ждал больше хорор моментов, неожиданных поворотов и более глубокий сюжет, который смог бы залатать дыры прошлых частей. На деле получилась игра с отличным экшеном(что для меня было на втором плане) но с наитупейшим сюжетом. Да и не то что бы сюжет тупой..просто он топчется на одном месте. Образ поинтмена мне вообще не понравился. Из солдата элитного подразделения феар, он превратился в бомжа. Этот образ ну никак не подходит. И что само бесит - галимый хорор и отсутствие неожиданных сюжетных поворотов. Напугать у разработчиков не получается. Да и эффекты присутсвия Альмы вообще испорчены. Во второй части от каждого появления бегали мурашки по коже.\nРазработчики в самом начале поставили не те задачи. Идея превратить FEAR в кооп шутер уже сразу не увенчался успехом.\nВердикт - отличный экшн, слоумоу пыш пыш, но сюжет просто калл. И когда будите принимать решение о покупке игры, подумайте за что вы полюбили прошлые части феар. За сюжет, хорор, или же экшн.\nP.S. Я очень хочу увидеть 4ю часть, но что бы в разработчиках значился Monolith.

It also has lost much of what made it a great shooter. Why am I recomending it then?\n\nSimple: the co-op is amazing. Most of those 7.5 hours on record? It was with a friend. It was also (unintentionally) hilarious. It's just a by-product of having two college students play through a game that wants you to take it seriously so much. I also have to admit, having Paxton Fettel as a playable character is a nice touch. Combine his ability to posess people with the Pointman's slo-mo powers, and there are some neat teamwork dynamics at play. If you see this game at a price where you can afford to buy it for yourself AND give it to a friend (especially to a funny one,) do so.\n\nHowever, if you want balls-to-the-wall mind****s, creepy atmosphere, and a gun that can staple people to walls, buy the other two.\n\nSeriously, though, this gun doesn't have The Penetrator? The one weapon that would make Co-op even more hilarious?","February 14, 2014","true","7.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I remember seeing the commercials on TV for this game and apparently had a misconception about how having Fettel as a secondary character would be.  Day 1 did some neat things with the game differently from Monolith, but ultimately I think they fell short of realizing the true potential of the game.\n\nI will say that I did not play the co-op portion at all...mostly because I had no one to play with.  That being said, I did complete the single-player mode, and unlocked Fettel on all missions to replay through again.  I did start this, but quickly lost interest, as the dialogue and almost everything about the game seemed quite repetitive, except you see cut scenes from Fettel's point of view.  I think the game itsefl could have had some awesome variety, as well as some extra gameplay time added for first play-through if the story involved using both characters and switching back and forth depending on the mission or circumstances.\n\nThe graphics I thought were much better, the control scheme vastly different, but I got used to it.  I do feel the realism factor increased in fighting by using the reddening screen and then letting the Point Man recover (I'm assuming part of his meta/super-humaness involved an accelerated healing factor).  Sometimes it gets old searching for health packs.\n\nI can't say I was super happy with the ending, but I wasn't disappointed either.  The story seemed to be building up to some amazing climax, but in the end just left me feeling sorry for Alma and wondering if she just wanted someone to be kind to her all along.  The cultish aspect of some of the later levels was a little disturbing, but that seemed to be more of where Fettel's character was going as well.  There's definitely plenty of blood.  Blood on the walls, blood flying from gunshots, knife kills, dripping from bodies and oozing from everyone you meet practically.\n\nI was startled a couple of times....never overly scared...\n\nThe variety of antagonists in the game was definitely a little more varied than in F.E.A.R. 2, but I'm guessing because Alma's power was at a max and everyone and everything was being affected more drastically.  Some of the goons you fight were more annoying than anything, and I started to get bored with fighting Replica Commanders very quickly.\n\nIf it's on sale, then definitely pick it up, but I wouldn't pay $20 for it.","January 28, 2014","true","18.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Is it better than F.E.A.R. 1? No, but it's a lot of fun in single player (I don't play co-op) and offers a campaign both as Point Man and Fettel, with the Point Man being the protagnist of the first game and Fettel being a ghost, offering interesting dynamics. The shooting is fast and fluid and the bullet-time mechanics the franchise is known far work beautifully in a series of shootouts involving soldiers and mechs providing a varied challenge. The addition of stick to cover mechanics isn't distracting. Although the shooting takes place mostly in tightly scripted sequences of areas with the occasional signposting problem where you need to look around to figure out where to go next, the steady clip of the action punctuated by good cutscenes maintains a solid pace throughout. A satisfying conclusion to the series that redeems the pathetic F.E.A.R. 2 and although I'd have liked more of the super intelligent AI of F.E.A.R. 1, this'll do.","February 4","true","6.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's an excellent co-op title, offering divergent experiences depending on which character is used. It's generally much more challenging then the earlier titles, affording you meager  regen health and many deaths if you do not take advantage of it's somewhat unusual first-person cover system. Most people dislike this mechanic, I for one enjoyed it in Killzone 2 and in this game. Fettel's powers are a blast to use and there is a satisfying array of weapons. Mechanically, the game is sound. However, it has some story problems. On the whole it is far less creepy the earlier titles, giving Alma a much reduced role and forgoing many scares in favor of more thrilling gun battles. Much like F.E.A.R. 2, it makes little use of prior story elements and opts to take things laterally, offering some interesting backstory but leaving the continuing narrative stagnant.","July 14, 2012","true","13.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But they all also feel very GENERIC.\n\nThe voices are bad, especially Alma's voice. Her only "line" is screaming, but it sounds like some random girl they pulled off the street. It stands out badly and wrecks the experience whenever it happens.\n\nThe dialogue is terrible, and while the other games in the series' stories were nothing to write home about, this one's plotjust plain stupid and incoherent. Literally every chapter ends with the hero falling down a hole or having his vehicle exploded, which conveniently means that each level starts with him having lost all of his weapons in the previous level. THIS IS BAD DESIGN.\n\nDesign-wise, the first 2 games were great in that lighting, sound cues and level design always had you looking and moving in the right direction. This one seems to have sound cues, but they're just parts of the soundtrack, so a little spooky chime that would have coincided with a crawling enemies scurrying past is just meaningless in this game. I found myself just plain missing some of the intended jump stares because I was turned in the wrong direction in this game, while that never happened in the other games. This game frequently resorts to graffitti arrows to guide you from arena-type area to arena-type area. Needing to do that should be a sign for developers that their game design SUCKS.\n\nThey totally removed the great sound design and cues from the first 2 games and replaced it with a run-of-the-mill, looping soundtrack that doesn't match ingame dynamics closely enough.\n\nThey also went with a rechargeable health mechanic that I don't think is as good for this series as the first aid kit model that all of the other games had. FEAR1 and 2 basically just made sure you were stocked up on health after every battle, which is just as unrealistic as the Halo model, but made each battle feel like a self-contained test of skill. Switching that model makes the basic feel of this game just feel out of character, and you can frequently just go hide behind a crate in the corner and recharge ad nauseum.\n\nAlso, the bullet time mechanic gets drained MUCH faster than in the other games and recharges much more slowly. I found myself in bullet time around 50% of the time in FEAR2 but only about 20% of the time here. Instead, all of the typical enemies are much less balanced to the character than before. In the other games, it was almost impossible to get through most encounters without bullet time because of that balance, but here, you only really need it during boss fights. Again, it really doesn't feel like a FEAR game as a reult.\n\nThey added a cover system that I basically never used, because you stay in 1st person perspective staring at the wall when you're in cover, which makes it a huge tactical disadvantage.\n\nOne of the most stupid things they added is an experience point system that affects how long you can bullet time and how many extra ammo clips you can carry. You get experience points via a series of way-too-gamey "achievements". What that means is that to get the most experience, you have to stop using a weapon after getting 10-25 kills with it, because each weapon only has one level of achievement. So, instead of using the best weapon available, you're forced to drop a good weapon after you've met its "quota" if you want to maximize your bullet time. This is STUPID. Even more stupid is achievements for using bullet time and cover that mean you'll want to start each level by sitting in cover for 200 seconds and use 5 minutes each level draining and recharging bullet time from max to empty a bunch of times to get those achievements. It's a design decision that breaks the flow of the game and rewards playing out of character. THIS IS IMMERSION BREAKING.\n\nCO-OP is VERY FUN in this game, despite all of the problems. Gunplay is quite nice and reminiscent of Homefront, CoD, etc.\n\nThe game is really designed to be played in CO-OP and it's disappointing that there's no AI "brother" companion during single-player. Him not being there during the shooting doesn't make sense in terms of the (badly written) story.\n\nAll in all, there's no reason to play this game unless you're:\n1. Playing it CO-OP\n2. Are out of other FPS's to play\n\nPlease note that the FEAR1 DLC's stories have been retconned out of this game, so it's not even really worth playing if you somehow feel invested in the trilogy's story enough to need to see the ending.","June 19, 2014","true","8.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

For starters, it's very short. Granted, I played it on easy as I have too many games to play and kind of rushed it, but it was still very short. The story is also extremely simple in plot and I could describe the entire plot of the game in a few sentences.\n\nThe plot involves Point Man, the player character from FEAR (the first game). Set nine months after the events of the first two games, Point Man is currently a prisoner in a favela in Brazil and escapes after a psychic connection with his brother, Paxton, the villain from the first game. After escaping the prison, the two of you travel back to Fairport (basically Seattle), to try and reach Alma, the psychic horror inducing woman/girl from the first two games. If you played the first two games, you'd recall that she ♥♥♥♥♥ Beckett, the player character from FEAR 2. Well, you and Paxton crash land in a suburb and have to make your way to the city, teaming up with Jin, the FEAR team member from the first game, and eventually finding Beckett who is being held captive by Armacham, the evil corporation that did the experiments on Alma and you and your brother. I don't wanna spoil the game, but there really isn't that much else to say on the plot. You just fight your way through the city, an airport, the tower, etc, until you reach the endgame.\n\nBeing a horror/FPS, I found this to be much less terrifying than the first two games and whenever I saw Alma, I wasn't even phased. It was just kind of like, "Oh, there's Alma. She'll disappear anyway, nothing to worry about. Unlike that one time in FEAR where you actually had to shoot her before she reaches you."\n\nThis isn't even a bad game as there actually are elements in this one that aren't in the others. Such as the cover system. At least I'm pretty sure the cover system wasn't in the first two, it's been a while since I played them on the 360. But the cover system in this one was probably the best cover system in an FPS I've played, as you actually stay in first person and can stick to the cover while leaning out.\n\nI guess I can say I was satisfied with this game as it concludes the story of Point Man and Alma, but it could have been a lot more interesting than just fighting your way to the city.

F.E.A.R. 3, however, is more of a co-op arcade cover based FPS with some very light psychic-horror elements.\n--\n--\nWho would most enjoy F.E.A.R. 3?\n--\nIf you're looking for a fast-pased co-op FPS, with a darker twist, F.E.A.R. 3 may be an enjoyable pick-up. The game fails to deliver the ambient terror and jump-scares of the previous title, and has a far weaker delivery of plot than its predecessors. That being said, it can make for an entertaining competative co-op experience, and provides a substantial amount of replay value, if that's what you're looking for.\n--\n--\nOver-all: 62.5%\nF.E.A.R. falls short in a lot of areas where the previous titles excelled, providing a weaker experience over-all. The game provides more replayability than any of the previous titles, but with that said, I'm not convinced that this is a good thing, on it's own, as the core gaming experience just isn't enjoyable enough to replay.\n--\nMechanics: 3/5\nThe mechanical flow of F.E.A.R. 3 is inferior to it's predecessor, F.E.A.R. 2. The AI is slightly less interesting, and largely more annoying to play against, the movement and cover system is functional, but not exactly fluid, as are the weapons. On top of this, the bullet-time (core mechanic) feels less fluid and less functional than in previous games.\n--\nExperience: 2/5\nThe textures of F.E.A.R. 3 have been updated, but the stylization was a serious turn-off for me. The game felt visually cheap, arcadey, and generally far from immursive. The audio fell short in all regards as well, providing much less emphasis towards the atmosphere than in previous titles, and in places, distracting from the atmosphere (enemy AI call-outs).\n\nBalance: 3/5\nSome weapons clearly out-class others, and are just as accessible, and the bullet-time mechanic seems to have been gutted to a degree. This aside, the game is decently balanced, and rarely overly frustrating, but the general balance is anything but remarkable.\n--\nLongevity: 4.5/5\nIf you can get past the short-comings of the game, it does provide a lot of content. There's a level-up system, two different viewpoints to play the campaign from, and a fairly decent co-op mechanic. Beyond that, there's a competative element, using an elaborate point system, and for the speed runners out there, a tracker for completion time.","July 7, 2014","false","9.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It's got very little in common with them except the plot.  It's got none of the atmosphere that the previus games had.  There is no fear.  I am not saying the previous games were all that scary, but they had the genuinely spooky quality to them, F.E.A.R. 3 doesn't.  It really tries to show that it's a F.E.A.R. game, but all the blood and gore in the world won't bring back that feeling you got when you first heard Alma laugh right behind you and when you turn all you see the mere flicker of a shadow run past your periphery.\n\nThey took everything that made the first games unique and awesome and made this another COD clone.  They replaced armor and health packs with regenerating health.  They limit your ammo supply, but leave lots of it lying around to pick up.  The SloMo drains too fast and isn't fun to use anymore.  There is no resource management, just run and gun.  The nerf to the SloMo combined with pre-positioned enemies takes all the fun away from anticipating where the enemy is coming from, using SloMo to catch them early and gunning down three to four enemies before they can react properly like the badass you're supposed to be.\n\nI am not saying the games sucks, it's just not I wanted or expected.","April 16, 2014","true","3.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I actually did jump a few times in this game, and the huge amounts of gore, spooky lighting, and atmosphere the game throws at you gives you quite an intense experience.

You have to get scared, you have to shoot, no exact point of the game.\n\nGameplay / Story\nI've played all F.E.A.R.s - 1,2 and finaly 3. Well, I enjoyed first and second part much more than the third. Maybe it is a good story, but the game developers made it look and feel WAY too bad. Seriously, the story is shown very bad - a voice acting is bad, cut-scenes are bad and.. basicly how is story tolerated is bad! Gameplay dissapointed me even more. I cannot say its unplayable, but taking cover, runing, jumping, shooting - it all SUCKS in this game. I mean its so messed up, that it makes camera shake and bug. Speaking of bugs, this game has A LOT of them. I bearly finished the whole game. I thought its the end of the nightmare, but no! There is also a cooperation mode which is EVEN WORSE THAN SINGLEPLAYER. Seriously, its even more unplayable. They shouldn't have even done it. Oh, I almost forgot - I finished whole campaign in 3 hours ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥it.\n\nSounds / Atmosphere / Level design\nWhole game sounded like a good game.. but from 5 years earlier. Sounds were more like for a sci-fi game, in a space, on a spaceship - not for a horror game, on Earth, on our freakin planet. Global atmosphere was fatal. Game wasn't scary at all. I finished this during one night and gone to bed with no nightmares. Level design is slighty better, and I can say the best of these three. But the 'open areas' were realy 'closed' sometimes, cause developers were too lazy to make some skyboxes in some locations.\n\nGraphics\nHere is what is as bad as gameplay is. I mean, its not THAT bad.. sorry... graphics... BUT YOU LOOK SO MAINSTREAM. Seriously, was that supposed to be a sci-fi game or a horror game? I must say though - models are made very good, and animations are also good (not these for weapons), but everything looks bad because of lame shaders. Damn, developers, that was THAT hard to make a Lens Flare shaders, that you included a fake ones in the sprites? Come on, guys...\n\nSo...\nas I said - I enjoyed FEAR 1st and 2nd more than 3th part. I do not recommend buying this game if you've got a slow PC. I recommend buying it when its on a bargain, cause 20 ♥♥♥♥in Euros is WAY TOO MUCH for this game.\n\n4.5/10","January 23, 2014","false","3.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","7"

Originality certainly helps and appreciate memorable elements of any kind. I rate Crysis 2 as one of the greatest of the genre. I liked FEAR but was indifferent to part 2. Played Fear 3's campaign to the end but little of the multiplayer.\n\nImpressions:\nThe engine looks ok and the shooting mechanics solid. There's a lot of realism in the world and gun play.. but that world is also drab and the enemies not particularly fun to shoot. The sound is really solid and the grunts chatter is situation appropriate and appears to intelligently adapt to how you engage them. However they also appear to be psychic calling your moves without eyes on you and are impossible to flank as they always seem to have a bead on you which dampens the fun of being a superior soldier, it feels like the game wants you to only ever take on frontal assaults in slow-mo and rely on your healing to save you every time.\n\nMakes 'Dead Space 3' feel like a a masterpiece of horror (another sadly tamed down, but still superior game) as it utterly fails to pull off scares, none are original or unexpected. I noted several early scripted jumps were totally mistimed as I was looking the wrong way or had already moved past the location. Overall there is a lack of polish and placeholder elements are all to obivous, for example flapping fabric elements are replaced with static 1 pixel thick sprites that jut out at as if they are stiff as a board.\n\nThe Good:\n*Decent graphics and general audio.\n*The cover mechanic works well and gives some options.\n*Magic healing is handy but almost too handy.\n*Gun play is decent but unimaginative.\n*Linear route stops you getting lost.\n*Grunt conversations are pretty realistic and dynamic.\n\n\nThe Bad:\n*Seriously disliked the Main menu interface, found it confusing.\n*World is very drab in the early stages and the grunts too hard to see.\n*Some textures and locations lack detail that jar in an otherwise more impressive world.\n*Gun sights actively make it harder to see the intended target.\n*For a cover game you rely on slow-mo far too much.\n*Grunts track you too well limiting flanking options.\n*Cover mechanic gets tedious and slows down the pace too far.\n*Weapons are boring standards and lack oomph or impact.\n*Fails at attempts at horror.\n*Slow-mo reveals the slack quality as, on a massively overspec'd machine, grunts jink making you deadeye shots miss.\n*Stealth seems to only apply when the developer wants you to use it.\n*Collectibles, upgrade points break immersion and other console tropes.\n*Linear route and narrow locations spoil exploration and experimentation.\n*Environment is destructible but rarely has any impact.\n*Story is too silly and becomes campy as cut-scenes lack impact and detail.\n\nRecommended for:\n3rd person shooter fans not looking for anything special to fill a gap, think more Call of Duty over Bioshock.\n\nConclusion.\n5/10. Seriously disappointing shooter that seems confused by its realistic world and weapons attached to weak fantasy horror setting and characters.","March 8, 2014","false","2.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Played Fear 3's campaign to the end but little of the multiplayer.\n\nImpressions:\nThe engine looks ok and the shooting mechanics solid. There's a lot of realism in the world and gun play.. but that world is also drab and the enemies not particularly fun to shoot. The sound is really solid and the grunts chatter is situation appropriate and appears to intelligently adapt to how you engage them. However they also appear to be psychic calling your moves without eyes on you and are impossible to flank as they always seem to have a bead on you which dampens the fun of being a superior soldier, it feels like the game wants you to only ever take on frontal assaults in slow-mo and rely on your healing to save you every time.\n\nMakes 'Dead Space 3' feel like a a masterpiece of horror (another sadly tamed down, but still superior game) as it utterly fails to pull off scares, none are original or unexpected. I noted several early scripted jumps were totally mistimed as I was looking the wrong way or had already moved past the location. Overall there is a lack of polish and placeholder elements are all to obivous, for example flapping fabric elements are replaced with static 1 pixel thick sprites that jut out at as if they are stiff as a board.\n\nThe Good:\n*Decent graphics and general audio.\n*The cover mechanic works well and gives some options.\n*Magic healing is handy but almost too handy.\n*Gun play is decent but unimaginative.\n*Linear route stops you getting lost.\n*Grunt conversations are pretty realistic and dynamic.\n\n\nThe Bad:\n*Seriously disliked the Main menu interface, found it confusing.\n*World is very drab in the early stages and the grunts too hard to see.\n*Some textures and locations lack detail that jar in an otherwise more impressive world.\n*Gun sights actively make it harder to see the intended target.\n*For a cover game you rely on slow-mo far too much.\n*Grunts track you too well limiting flanking options.\n*Cover mechanic gets tedious and slows down the pace too far.\n*Weapons are boring standards and lack oomph or impact.\n*Fails at attempts at horror.\n*Slow-mo reveals the slack quality as, on a massively overspec'd machine, grunts jink making you deadeye shots miss.\n*Stealth seems to only apply when the developer wants you to use it.\n*Collectibles, upgrade points break immersion and other console tropes.\n*Linear route and narrow locations spoil exploration and experimentation.\n*Environment is destructible but rarely has any impact.\n*Story is too silly and becomes campy as cut-scenes lack impact and detail.\n\nRecommended for:\n3rd person shooter fans not looking for anything special to fill a gap, think more Call of Duty over Bioshock.\n\nConclusion.\n5/10. Seriously disappointing shooter that seems confused by its realistic world and weapons attached to weak fantasy horror setting and characters.","March 8, 2014","false","2.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It isn't scary in the sense of Amnesia or even Lone Survivor, but more in a scary sense of Doom 3 but kicked up a few notches. I actually did jump a few times in this game, and the huge amounts of gore, spooky lighting, and atmosphere the game throws at you gives you quite an intense experience. The level design is also very good, allowing you to explore extremely spooky areas with blood dripping upwards and dead-eyed teddy bears and dismembered corpses on a regular basis. Speaking of the lighting - it's phenomenal. Some of the best I've ever seen with ambient, red, and even water lighting graphics. It was outstanding. One part that really stands out for me is in an airport terminal. It's raining outside and if you look up you can see the water pooling on the glass ceiling and the lightning flashes and shows rain type effects on the wall and grounds of the terminal. It's a real shame this game tanked and Day1 studios went defunct because this incarnation of the Despair engine is of superb quality.\n\nAnother great thing about this game is the co-op. I would *strongly* recommend playing through with a friend as the story and gameplay (each of the two characters is unique and has different abilities/uses in battle) really seems to be geared towards to the co-op mindset and even the ending depends on how the two players play together. Voice chat in the client worked flawlessly and there were no other networking problems that I discovered in a playthrough. There is also a multiplayer mode, but I didn't play that before writing this review and am basing my judgement solely on the single-player experience.\n\nPros:\n\nLighting - amazing\nWeaponry/Shooting "Feels Good" - weapons have "weight" to them\nCo-op\nGraphics\nAmbiance\nReasonably Scary\n\nCons:\n\nSome Level Design Choices - platforming\n\nThe only big con I have with this game is there's a little element of platforming on certain levels where if you fall off something you automatically die and both players have to start back at the checkpoint. This ruins the otherwise excellent co-op gameplay and could be easily rectified with something like the revive mechanic for regular deaths - perhaps hanging onto the ledge and pulling the other player up. Other than that this game was great and I would recommend it for a co-op shooter. B+","January 6, 2013","true","11.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ninjamurai/recommended/21100/","ninjamurai","Ninjamurai","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ninjamurai/","570 products in account","After giving it multiple goes after reinstalling it, and finally just sticking with it, I just still can't really recommend it for multiple reasons.\n\nIt is obvious that much of this game was made to simply just try to jump onto the success of more modern shooters like Call of Duty, even though the series originated from much of the opposite. Almost every gun except for the shotgun has Aim Down Sights, no more collecting and using med-kits because your health regenerates, only two weapons max, and instead of leaning left and right you press a button to glue yourself to nearby chest-high-walls.\n\nThere are so many things wrong with this game not only from the point of an original F.E.A.R. fan, but even when stood on its own.\n\n-Annoying and unrealistic Bloody Screen when wounded, accompanied with fast acting health regeneration.\nCompletely slows down gameplay, makes certain areas extremely easy due to being near invincible, and makes some areas extremely hard due to not being able to heal instantaneously via med-kit and having to find a spot not being hitscanned into oblivion.\n\n-Kung-fu moves have been chopped out. No punches, just a knife. No bicycle kicks, just one dinky kick. These simple animations made the last games so much more fun, even if the new moves do exactly the same purpose. The aesthetic just isn't the same.\n\n-The first 2 or 3 level designs are ripped straight out of Modern Warfare. "Escape the Prison!" "Escape the South American Favela!" Truly takes you out of the F.E.A.R. universe, and it's a shame that they thought opening with such unfitting levels would be a good idea when it only helps make an even worse first impression.\n\n-No more finding health and slowmo upgrades throughout the environment. To improve your health and slowmo, you have to rank up with the new score and challenge system. You can still find hidden dolls and certain bodies that give instant extra "score" (XP really), but it's such a strange decision to add a rank and score system into a game that was basically the opposite of an arcade/points based game...\n\n-The horror aspect of this game was weaker than ever before, even though it was never my favorite part of the games before these. There are a lot less times where the game tries to jump scare you, and even when they do you don't get caught off gaurd because they try to pull one off in the middle of a warzone.\n\n-They gave Point-man a face. A boring, bearded, scowling face. Yet he still never talks... As if it wasn't enough that he couldn't do badass psychic kung-fu anymore.\n\n-The enemies are just not intimidating anymore. The AI is still OK, but it just does not seem as good as the AI in the first game. The voices for them don't have the badass radio static that the first game had, and they spend 90% of their time completely behind cover.\n\n-The new cover system is ok, but having the ability to lean like we used to is much more handy as it gives the player to make useful cover out of anything, whereas now you can only lean out from very certain few pieces of scenery. Half of your head seems to be poking out of cover most of the time as you can still get torn to shreds, enemies are able to hide in cover better than you.\n\nThe game overall is OK, but as a F.E.A.R. game, or as an olds-chool shooter, it is just so underwhelming and hard to enjoy. Even if I was a completely blank slate on the series, I would still feel very unfavorably for this game, as it seems to attempt to merge the newer Modern Warfare type shooter with older Doom (3) type shooters, and it just becomes such a clunky mess. There are an annoying amount of out-of-character cutscenes, there are an annoying amount of context actions like going through doors, or turnstiles, or over chest-high-walls...\n\nIt's just a shame that the series that helped make PC gaming PC Gaming was obviously developed for more of the younger console crowd involved, but only managed to sort of make an experience not very enjoyable for either type of gamer, PC or console. All I can really hope for is for some sort of spiritual successor to F.E.A.R. that incorporates super psychic kung-fu soldiers in a more modern engine and graphics set, because this game just leaves me itching for more of the classics.","January 30","false","5.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

The game feels like an average FPS rather than a true FEAR game. Most of the time you will be fighting soldiers and it doesn't feel too scary, although as you get closer to the end, the more "FEARy" the game gets. There are  a total of 8 missions , which brings me to the next unfortunate bit, the length of the game. It took me and my mate a little bit over 4 hours to complete the game which is a bit sad because, in general, the world felt awesome and I would've loved to continue playing it. What is a huge + to the game is the  co-op portion . The game is really fun to play together with a friend, which is where the difference of the two playable characters comes into play. You often find yourself in a situation where you need to rely on your mate. You get a decent story in a beautiful environment and after a long coop game you and your mate face a sudden twist that will make you either smile or frown,  the one who gets the highest score gets his characters' ending cinematic, Anna lives or DIES .

It can be an enjoyable romp with a friend in co-op, and the odd, but ultimately interesting mechanics that makeup the dynamic brotherly duo of Point Man and Paxton Fettel can be oddly fun, even with the story being insultingly bad, and not enjoyed in an ironic way either.  The game still looks pretty decent, and the combat holds up solid, but of course you will literally need to bring a friend if you want to play co-op. The years have not been kind because like the multiplayer, co-op’s as dead as Alma is. Which is sad, because they did try, but not enough unfortunately to make it shine, and I don’t doubt WB had its gnarled claw in the mix as well. So the legacy ends with a thump, if not for F.E.A.R. Online making a final macabre display of the franchise, at least the name will be remembered for the superb enemy A.I.\n\nI will provide additional details, if requested for, in the comment section of the review.","May 17","false","15.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

But no. Fear 3 is comparatively terrible. It feels mostly like any modern military shooter game complete with cover mechanics, auto heal, having only 2 guns at once and a terrible fov. The shooting feels a bit better than in F.E.A.R. 2 and the levels are more diverse (but still hallways) but those are the only advantages compared to the rest of the series.\nThe whole co-op aspect feels tacked on, Paxton Fettel is annoying and the levels feel too disconnected from each other. That you start every level with basically nothing doesn't help. They don't even really try to bring scares in anymore.

If you are a lone wolf type, move along.\n\nThis game is great. Not because it is scary, but because the fun that can be had with others. If you were expecting a scary game just try the original F.E.A.R.. It was the only one in the series that was even remotely scary. Otherwise play Amnenisa.\n\nThe story is somewhat forgettable but you never feel like you don't know what is going on (I'm looking at you Dead Space 3). The main reason to buy this game is for the co-op. This isn't your standard co-op run and gun either. Each player has their own abilities. While the hardest difficultly isn't extremely hard, you'll have to coordinate who uses what powers to help progress. I really did find this to be one of the best co-op games to date.\n\nF.E.A.R. 3's multiplayer modes also include co-op so there are things to do after beating the main game. "Fu**ing Run!" is by far my favorite! This mode has three maps which have you running from a wall could of death. You'll have to maneuver through the map and even enemies as they try to stop you. If one player dies, it is game over. So you can't leave anyone behind. Even on easy this is really hard to complete! "Contractions", another co-op game mode, has you holding up a building as waves of enemies try to kill everyone. The mode is fun, but can get a bit boring after awhile. The other two modes are death match style games that I do not care for and more than likely, you won't either. The downside to the multiplayer, it's kind of dead. No one hosts a game and you can't join mid-session. The online co-op game modes only allow up to four players but can be done with two.\n\n(If my time playing this game is low at the time you are reading this it is because I played through on the Xbox 360. I bought this for PC because I liked it so much.)","December 10, 2013","true","1.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/widgetguy/recommended/21100/","widgetguy","widgetguy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/widgetguy/","972 products in account","Finishing off the FEAR trilogy!\n\nEvery time I see FEAR 3 on sale I see people bashing it as the worst in the series, but the meta score is actually not too bad 74/100. Unlike the first 2 FEAR games, FEAR 3 has one of those regenerating health systems where you just hide under cover for a few seconds and you recover back to full health. No need to scrounge for med kits or armor. Also, the game seems built around 2 player co-op, which I like in first person shooter games (when I have someone to play with).\n\n*Spoilers ahead*\nFEAR 3 takes place an unspecified amount of time after the events of FEAR 2. Alma is pregnant and getting ready to give birth, as a result her psychic power is tearing up the city (possibly the world). Again the main opposition is the private military contractor Armacham, who seems to have become 100x more powerful than they were in the first games. Even without their clone super soldiers from the first games, Armacham seems capable of overrunning and occupying entire cities with soldiers, aircraft, and power armor. You play the Point Man protagonist from the first FEAR game (the guy you play in FEAR 2 also shows up briefly) but this time you have an “imaginary” friend Paxton Fettel (Bad guy from the first game). Your primary goal this time around is to reach Alma before she gives birth and deal with her once and for all. Unfortunately for you, Alma’s psychic pain has summoned nightmare creatures and twisted the surviving civilian population into crazed psychos.\n\nUnlike the previous FEAR games, FEAR 3 is broken down into missions or “levels” with each mission giving you a point score at the end. You gain points by finding collectables, killing enemies, and completing “challenges.” The challenges are similar to the “Skill shots” in Bulletstorm, where it’s basically just using various methods of killing. For example, 2000 points for killing enemies with a specific weapon, or 1000 points for getting 25 headshots, or 2000 points for getting 3 backstabs. The points aren’t just for show, by the way. You “level up” when you gain enough points and each level gives you some kind of perk, such as +10% health or +bullet capacity. You can replay levels as many times as you want to “grind” for points. This means that the game will get easier over time as you replay it. You might notice that when you first start the game, it seems far more difficult than the previous ones, well this changes as you level up and get stronger. The regenerating health means you can charge groups of enemies and just duck for cover when your screen is almost completely red (near death). Healing is free unlike FEAR 1 and 2 which had limited med kits.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, the game is built with 2 player co-op in mind. At the end of each mission there is a ranking between the 2 players to see who scored highest in several categories. The game’s ending depends on which of the two characters “won” the most missions. Of course if you’re playing single player the character you’re playing (Fettel or Point Man) will “win” every level you complete. Point Man’s gameplay is the same as the previous games (standard shooter with Slow-Mo power), But Fettel is a psychic commander. This means he can possess enemies and use them to fight (he doesn’t have slow-mo). Every time he takes over a new body he gets the weapons of the possessed enemy, so you can’t hoard powerful weapons or grenades the way Point Man does. You can only hold 2 weapons now, unlike 3 weapons in FEAR 1 and 4 weapons in FEAR 2. Possession also means you won’t be able to use the awesome power armors because the possessed body won’t last long enough.\n\nPros:\n+Excellent graphics and visuals. Large variety of weapons available.\n+Some cool new enemies, particular the Phase Commander and Phase Caster.\n+A lot of replay value. I just finished the game and immediately restarted as Fettel.\n+2 player co-op available. Also a bunch of various multiplayer game modes I haven’t tried.\n\nCons:\n-The game is very short, about 6 hours to beat the first time. Replay is strongly encouraged though.\n-The story is weaker than the first FEAR games. There’re a lot of unnecessary “dream sequences” that don’t seem to add much. You just walk forward about 15 seconds with someone talking in voice over and it ends.\n-I get the feeling that the enemies are much “dumber” than FEAR 1 enemies. They tend to stick behind the same piece of cover and just pop their heads out to shoot from there.\n\nOverall I think the game is well worth playing for fans of First Person Shooters and people who want to see how the FEAR story ends. Once you finish a mission in single player, the Fettel character is unlocked so you can try playing him for that particular level. The way to see the Fettel game ending is by playing through the game a second time (or play the game in co-op and Fettel has the highest score every mission). One thing I noticed is that the game’s Steam achievements seem to be half for multiplayer, and not many people are playing the multiplayer. This isn’t surprising since the game has been out for a few years. I’ll probably only be able to get about 45% completion for the game achievements by myself.\n","September 12, 2014","true","21.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The horror elements were pretty much reduced to quick-time events in F.E.A.R. 2 and have been binned altogether by the third game; the gameplay is as uninspiring as ever with most enemies taking all of one headshot to kill; the story is completely nonsensical even if you ignore the first game and worse still if you do take it into account; and instead of the perplexing abortion of an ending that we got in F.E.A.R. 2, we now have TWO of the bloody things.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nostromer/recommended/21100/","nostromer","nostromer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nostromer/","442 products in account","Ok. Let me start by saying I'm a HUGE fan of the first two games. They both bring something different to the table and they had all the atmosphere, scares, and visceral combat the franchise is known for.\n\nF3AR Is severly lacking the simplest way this is not a FEAR game. There is a new studio, a new engine - and entirely new writers. Let me start with some gameplay changes:\n\nThe persistent weapon carry system is gone - there is now a 2 weapon limit that resets upon the start of each new chapter. Don't bother saving up and trading off a weapon for a fully filled rocket launcher unless you plan to use it, because It'll be gone at the end by the time the cutscenes come up. The health/armor system is gone and in place is a regenerating health system. This hurts the gameplay due to the fact that you can simply melee the majority of the jump mosters and sit healing before moving to the next trigger- it kills the adrenaline entirely. The classic replicant variants are gone in favor or new, completely arbitrary lore-breaking entities with poor voice acting and predictable movement. The classic FEAR A.I. is gone, and what they've implemented here is atrocious. Many times "elite" AI will sit in a single place ducking behind cover while I set up for the next headshot. The booster/reflex injector mechanic is gone in favor or hoping players will alter their play to "score up" and unlock the next level, which merely increases your grenade and slo-mo meter. The slo-mo is the weakest yet, and drains much too fast and takes obnoxiously long to refill... The problem with this is that the award/score system is fundamentally flawed with things like giving you points for fully draining your meter 3 times in a chapter. The game rewards you for time in cover, picking up ammo, finding pointless psychic links, picking up alma doll's (what?), getting headshots, consecutive kills without damage and so on. This would be all fine and dandy but the co-op quickly turns into PVP with the ending of the entire game dependant on who gets the highest score overall. The clever level design and setpieces of the first are instead shifted here with lackluster textured environments that are riddled with tacky cover points much similar to gears of war and other 3rd person titles. The cover system hardly needs to be utilized, as a crouch toggle behind cover works faster - BUT - it doesn't give you the score points for staying in cover X amount of seconds (what?). The linearity and uninspired level design pushes further by unrealistic structures with only a handful of recycled items scattered throughout - this kills the immersion entirely. The intel items from FEAR 1 and FEAR 2 are gone, and there is no extra easter-eggs or background text to dive into, its bare-bones aside from collectibles that increase your score.\n\nEvery time you collect items, or complete challenges, you have a constantly annoying banner popping up telling you how much of a badass you are for getting 30 slo-mo kills, picking up ammo you would anyways, or doing anything you normally would in the flow of gameplay. Again, another immersion killer - but hey - we've gotten past that this game isn't the slightest bit scary. The game isn't even chilling, the highly-scripted scares are mostly FX and art based with no actual tension to worry about death.\n\nThe mech combat returns from FEAR 2 with two different variations, but gone is the extra effects such as infared vision. The addition of other enemy types hardly brings anything to the background of the story with weird psycho's called occultists, and a constantly pestering psychic monster which is explained later in the game. The variety presented here makes no sense with the continuity of the franchise and it has nothing fresh to bring to the table.\n\nMost of the weapon variants return from previous games although poor - gone is the selective fire mode, so once you get the 3-burst rifle, your stuck with 3 burst. The ammo placements are laughable, with hidden area's having a single pistol on the ground when I'm loaded up with two rifles. This might be great, but with the 2 weapon limit, it kills the need to ever use lesser tiers of weapons, save for again - the award points. +25 kills with the pistol! woo!\n\nThe story of this game completely tarnishes everything in the FEAR universe. It leaves no leaf unturned. From the voice acting, or the follow events with characters from FEAR 2 - its a slap in the face to all fans who have invested thought into this mysterious story. Every chapter ends, and sometimes begins with a poorly animated cutscene that drags this experience even lower. It leaves even veteran players confused and asking... why?\n\nIn short this game was made to cash in on the co-op craze and call of duty style reward system that was huge at the time. It threw away all of the innovations of the first two titles to lure in console players and casual FPS fans that can't stand a game without a progression system. I couldn't recommend this game even as a free title. The campaign is short, and rewards you for completing chapters fast & under a set time, rather than relishing in the atmosphere and taking in the level design.\n\nThe name Day 1 Studios tells you everything you need to know about this game, because It's apparent they didn't spend more than 1 day on any particular facet of this once-amazing franchise.

I promise I tried to make this review short, but there's just so much to say... Sorry. Let us begin.\n\nI shall also mention that, at the time of writing this review, I have completed the game twice - once as Fettel, once as the Pointman. I have not yet played the coop, although I'm sure it'll be a grand old time.\n\nRight off the bat, it is glaringly obvious that this game is intended to be cooperative. Is that a bad thing? Well, not inherently, coop shooters have been around for a very long time and there are a couple examples of cooperative horror done right. That is to say, it is still very scary indeed in spite the fact that you are not alone. However, given the fact that F.E.A.R. 3 doesn't deserve to be called a horror game - I'll get to that later - that's a rather moot point. So, you play as either the Point Man from the first game, or his brother Fettel. The Pointman obviously has bullet time, and Fettel the ability to possess enemies for a given time. I will say that the Pointman plays how you expect him to, no problems there, and Fettel is quite fun to play as well with what seems - to me, anyway - to be a rather well fleshed-out special ability. However, at the same time, it seems well balanced to the Pointman's and the enemies around. Although it would not surprise me if it is commonplace to fight to get Fettel over the Pointman.\nGetting back on topic, coop in itself is not an issue really, but I do believe that it was one of the big downfalls of this game. I shall elaborate at the end of this review.\n\nThe second glaringly obvious addition which made me very upset when I first saw it was the inclusion of a per-level point system, complete with goals to earn you additional points which are snarkily or punnily named. Well, that's not very F.E.A.R.-like at all, now is it? Or horror-game like in general, really. Why, you ask? Well, in terms of U.I. and game mechanics, having a score system - let alone one with a little status menu you can look at in-game (by pressing F1) - kinda breaks the player's immersion. Maybe a post-mission stats screen would be okay, but having nothing at all - like in the last two F.E.A.R. games - would be a lot better. Hell, in the first game, immersion was one of the biggest things they were striving for! Hence the inclusion of such details like a full shadow for the player, good arm models, and the ability to look down and actually see your legs and feet. Same with the stigma the first game had about never taking control away from the player when possible. There were probably two cutscenes in the first game, and most of the times control is taken away from you is a few seconds after something whacked you on your butt and your person gets up, and even then it's almost nice as a breather between the action. This game, on the other hand, of course has that point-system, and cutscenes galore; the things bookending every single level.\nAlthough to be honest, immersion is a bit of a moot point with the lack of actual scares in the game...\n\nLet's get onto the horror elements, now. Or rather the lack-there-of. This game is not a horror game at all, it is a first-person shooter through and through. What makes me say that? Well, there are only four or five times in the entire game where it even tries to scare you or creep you out - and those times a very shortlived and ineffective. Going in fully blind, I didn't even get that sense of dread and not wanting to keep moving forward like I did in the first game. It did make me jump once in fear, although that was when I was walking through a seemingly empty house and an enemy - unintentionally - snuck up behind me and started yelling while clawing at me. T'was unexpected, but I don't think most people would even get scared by that - assuming they were playing it like one should an FPS; keeping their head on a swivel. There really just seemed like a lack of effort with the scares, to be honest. While I am sure they did try their best with the scary moments that are present, keep in mind there's literally four or five of them.\n\nAlright, so because this game is an FPS now, let's cover that next.\nThe short version? It's your standard console shooter. What do I mean by that? Well, we now have regenerating health, a full cover system, a two-weapon carry limit, a very standard assortment of weapons outside of two which are even then not too interesting. You read that right, regenerating health in a F.E.A.R. game. A cover system, too, which I thought at first was kinda nice and was a change I'd be indifferent too. However, about midway through the game on my first run, I had a realization; the cover system was killing the pace of the combat. Hell, there's practically no need for the Pointman's bullet time given this. Just play it like you would Gears of War or similar and you're good to go. There's no panic or amazing action like in the first game, where there was no cover, and you had to be quick and clever to take out a whole squad. Though this was helped by a normal - or nowadays 'old school' - health system which, of course, gave you one-hundred points of health, and up to ten medkits which healed you a certain amount at the press of a button. Here, even if you try and replicate the amazing shootouts you remember from the original F.E.A.R. - and even the second game to a lesser extent - you're going to die, because the very nature of the regenerating health system doesn't allow such things. Even if you pull it off, you're just handicapping yourself really.\n\nHowever, then I had a thought. I stopped thinking about it as a F.E.A.R. game. Suddenly things got a lot better. This isn't a lazy, poorly made cash-in in my eyes, it was just made with the wrong license. If this game didn't have the F.E.A.R. title attatched to it, I would like it a hellofalot more. There was effort put in, and it is certainly fun to play at points, and at it's worst it's just like any other standard MMS (Modern Military Shooter), and I'm sure it'll be a blast when I get around to coop. It just shouldn't have been a F.E.A.R. game.\n\nWhile this is byfar the worst game in the F.E.A.R. franchise, but it's not a bad game on its own. Unless you count modern shooters bad, and I don't disagree with you if you do.","April 29","false","20.6"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/IWearLeatherShoes/recommended/21100/","IWearLeatherShoes","Tundra Scorpion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/IWearLeatherShoes/","185 products in account","I know I haven't finished the game yet, but I'm making an exception to my recent "never write a review until I've finished the game" rule, and here's why:\nF.E.A.R. 3 does not cooperate with Steam Cloud, meaning that if something happens and you have to reinstall Steam then F.E.A.R. 3 will not bring over your save files, meaning that you have to start the game again from the very beginning. This happened first when I uninstalled then reinstalled Steam to clean my disk space of all the redundant files leftover from Steam's updates. Afterwards I had to play F.E.A.R. 3 again from the very beginning, since I took a break from the game after reaching a particularily frustrating boss fight. Then just last week I sent my computer away to get an operating system upgrade, which also meant that I had to reinstall Steam, which coincided with another temporary F.E.A.R. break as I have hit another frustrating point in the game. Now that the game has reset a second time I actually have no intention of replaying everything again up to that point, so I am now writing this review to hold over until some time in the distant future when I decide to revisit the F.E.A.R. series.\n\nFrom a basic and simple list of pros and cons written during my experiences in the game, I have generally mixed feeling about F.E.A.R. 3 (herein referred to as F3): The game has a vast improvement on the story, which I felt was really lacking in the previous titles, I'm able to follow it better because I actually somewhat care about what's happening, which was not the case before. Previously the exposition for the story tested my patience because it distracted from the gameplay and wasn't particularily interesting. F3 is better here because the environments showcase the events going on, I actually see and feel the world tearing apart at the seams, and without saying too much, that is exactly what is happening and it is up to the player to stop it with some unexpected help. This is made even better because that annoying little girl who'd always jump out and go "ABOOGABOOGABOOGA" is barely around. Alma, you aren't scary, you're just wierd. Get lost and let me shoot things. But the drawback with story is that instead of little girl jumpscares, it has cutscenes. This wouldn't be such a bad thing if not for one flaw: You play as a silent protagonist. Silent protagonists work if you have control over them at all times, giving the player control during all story exposition and making them feel like they are the hero of the story, like Half-Life 2, which did the silent hero thing perfectly. F3 however has cutscenes with supporting characters directly addressing the hero, who never responds or shows any signs of reaction, just stands there silently glaring at everything. Do you see the problem here? But at least the shooting is fun, and when you are actually in control it makes sense to keep his yak shut.\nSpeaking of shooting, my god is the combat in this game amped up. With the tense environments and the unsettling enemies you're up against the game should have combat that's fast paced and free flowing, right? Well yes and no. The actualy gunplay is very tight, reactive and satisfying as you blow chunks out of your enemies with a good supply of firearms, that sniper rifle is a very welcome addition to my arsenal let me tell you. Enemies are varied and keep the player on their toes, ranging from simple tactical grunts who actively take cover to deranged bloodsoaked lunatics going kamikaze with explosives strapped to their chests, and it wouldn't be F.E.A.R. without the giant mech every now and again would it? The mechs are an intense fight making the player jump from aggressive force to defensive turtle in an instant, and like in F.E.A.R. 2 you can pilot them when you find an empty one, my god that part is so fun.\nBut then there's the biggest gripe I've heard about F3. The cover system. Cover systems in a first-person game I find to be always sticky, clumsy and awkward, and this is no exception. A cover system would work better in a third-person over the shoulder viewpoint because the perspective allows it to work to it's full potential as the Mass Effect games show, but in F3 it's just not needed. When we needed cover before in a first-person game we simply pressed the crouch button behind a barrel, and let go of the crouch button to come out. We don't want or need some backend programming making us stick to the cover until we press the button, as it restricts our movement and makes things way more angering than they need to be. Keep cover systems OUT of first-person shooters. Got it?\nAnd then my biggest gripe about F3, the regenerating health system. In the previous games you could find and pick up healthkits to use when you needed them, which gave you more control over how the combat flowed while keeping you mindful of your current inventory of health, and that was fine, it was fun and made sense. With F3 however you just wait a moment and your wounds magically heal themselves, it's not fitting in the game and it made certain areas and boss fights way more frustrating (which is why I took my breaks from this game before I punched something). The big boss battles are in an arena with not as much cover so you don't often get a break to let your cuts and bruises fix themselves, you have to be always on the move, most of the time being in the direct line of fire of the boss enemy. With the healthkits system you could drop a few grenades and heavy weapons fire on the tanky enemy, using your healthkits as you do so, that way you can tank more damage which also made inventory management so much more important because popping first-aid like tic-tacs would screw you over in the inevitable boss arenas. With F3 however the arenas follow the same guidelines, leaving you open more often than not, but you can't tank damage. This is a major problem with the game, the boss fights aren't intense and challenging, their infuriating and kill the experience. Even the limited cover you have won't help you because some bosses have smaller allies that flank you and others can walk through the freakin' walls and get right in your face. It's not a fair challenge and I cannot play these boss fights without getting angry at the game, hence why I took these breaks that ultimately forced me through a series of unavoidable events to play it all from the beginning.\nThere is also an in-game levelling and perk system that rates your performance in each level, giving you optional challenges to complete while playing such as "kill x amount of enemies with melee" and whatnot with the reward for levelling up being a buff in either the player's max health, reflex bar (which slows down time while in use, giving more delicious gunplay goodness) and other things. The only problem is that the game selects what to upgrade for you, you have no choice. If you want more health? Too bad, more reflex. It would be so much more engaging if you could choose what to level up, but for some reason you're not allowed to.\n\nSo with all my mixed feelings about F.E.A.R. 3 I had to ask myself, do I or do I not recommend it? When the game gets something right, it gets it right. But there are equal moments of B.S. that make F.E.A.R. 3 take a massive step backwards from the last game which is by and far my favorite game in the series. So to be completely and utterly honest? No, I cannot in good conscience give F.E.A.R. 3 a positive recommendation. It's flaws are so game-breaking and the direction the developers want to take it is so confused that the whole experience suffers as a result. If you were able to follow and pay attention to the storyline unlike me then you'd probably want to play it for the closure of the series' finale, but otherwise I'd say just play up to F.E.A.R. 2 and leave it at that.","October 5, 2014","false","8.5"," 11 of 21 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","11","21","0","0"

Barely any unique Alma encounters or scary/creepy happenings that weren't random jumpscares (half of which are either just loud random noises or extremely easy to miss). Combat was typical of a F.E.A.R. game as Point Man, not a bad thing, but feels a lot cheaper due to the point system. Point system is downright intrusive and immersion breaking at times.

From backstabbing, headshots, using specific weapons, to killing without taking damage, the objective is to outdo your brother and become the "favorite son."\n\nSince the game was designed with 2p coop in mind, virtually all secondary item-finding exploration has been eliminated. This includes healthpacks and armor, which has been replaced with regenerating health. Even so the game presents a wide variety of environments and a ton of complex areas to go through.\n\nIf you're playing this game by yourself you're really not doing it right.

They have been publishing many different games so I won't mention any of them at the moment. F.E.A.R. 3, or Fear3 for short is a horror game which continues the story of the first two parts.\n\nAbout Gameplay.\nFear 3 offers three different types of gameplay, singleplayer, co-op and multiplayer. Single player and co-op both have the same story to go through. Single player is much more challenging thought. The game is a continuation of the first two FEAR games, therefore in Fear 3 you play as Point Man, a guy who you have been playing as since the first FEAR game, while your friend gets to play Fettel, your badass ghost brother who you killed in the first game. Point Man's only power is to slow down time and react quicker, while Fettel can choke people, consume their body and so on and on.\n\nThe multiplayer is something different from the other games. In Fear 3, multiplayer is a survival game. A survival in which you need to gather crates and put them in a specific area to unlock more weapons, which will then help you survive more and more rounds. The only sad thing about it is that the multiplayer has died out completely, and I wasn't able to find even a single server. But then again, playing with people you know is always more fun than with strangers!\n\nThe game also has a handful selection of guns. There's not many of them and they are not too special, but it's always fun to try out new stuff. Thought, you will always find yourself mainly using the start gun that you obtain in the very early part of the game. On come co-op missions you even get to use a mech, which is very, very fun to play with!\n\nGraphic and Audio\nGraphic of this game is pretty good, but nothing out of the ordinary. Audio is okay but it does get rather empty most of the time.\n\n\nPros, cons and final grade.\nPros:\n- Nice Co-Op experience.\n\nCons:\n- Multiplayer is dead\n- The game does not bring anything new.\n\nFinal Grade: 4/10\n\nExtra Info: It actually took me a long, long time to write this review. I just didn't know what to write about the game. It's a very fun co-op game, but.. Nothing special. If you can get it cheaply, go for it.\n\n\nThank you for reading my review!

I would sum what happens in F.E.A.R 3, but the story is so forgettable that I can't remember what happened in it, and I beat it twice. Apparently the two brothers have to go and stop Alma's baby from being born, but the game throws in a multiple ending that rewards whoever was the "best brother." That means A. you need to beat the story mode twice to get all endings or B. Play the whole 6 HOUR story mode in co op.\n\nGameplay is dumbed down from the last 2 F.E.A.R games. There is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ cover system, you can only carry 2 guns, health regenerates, and F.E.A.R's top of the line AI has been reduced to standard FPS AI.\n\nThe worst part is that the game isn't scary. F.E.A.R 2 wasn't all that scary, but it had great gameplay to make up for it. F.E.A.R 3 has nothing going for it besides a co-op that, once again, doesn't make it scary.

Simple notes:\n\n-Although it dosent have that scary factor that the FEAR francize started with, its still a very playable game because it has good graphics, gameplay and storyline. I recomend it, considering it a [must play at least once in a lifetime] game.\n\n-The story line and short animation clips are very much impressive and interesting; they make the player understand step by step whats going on and by the end of the game it blows your mind away when you realise where and how it all started.\n\n-My favorite: The slow motion obtion + rocket launcher = EPIC FREAKING GAMEPLAY.\n\n-And another thing that makes you enjoy the game more is that the multiplayer comunity is still alive. You could find almost\nanytime players who are willing to play co-op or MP.\n\nGreat game!\n\n","August 4, 2014","true","32.6"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

This game waters down F.E.A.R. 2 even further with regenerating health, a higher reliance on action sequences and shootouts, forgettable music, awful pre-rendered cutscenes, a decreased quality in visuals, and scares that fail to impress. The story itself returns to the series' main protagonist, but the game fumbles with its momentum, switching between action and horror sequences too quickly. The game can hardly don the style "psychological horror" as most of the scary elements are tangible, such as crazed humans or otherworldly monsters.\n\nThere are no terrorizing setpieces like in the previous two games. Even F.E.A.R. 3's scariest moments are nothing compared to sequences like the school basement or the failed commander experiments from the previous game. It borrows too many elements from the typical "bro shooter", in order to strengthen the co-op. Because you know, nothing's scarier than having a buddy right next to you while you're afraid. I can only imagine the co-op was a corporate decision, and it was a bad decision. The story is interesting enough, and I enjoyed looking into the brothers' past, but Point Man isn't at all likeable and Fettel is a smug ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who has no reason to be helping his brother.\n\nF.E.A.R. 3 fell victim to trends. It's got a few scares here and there, but the regenerating health takes an enormous amount of edge off of the game, the cover mechanic is flimsy, the enemies are downright ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, and the co-op is incredibly shoehorned. This is not how you make a horror game. This is how you make a sub-par bro-shooter.","May 9, 2014","false","11.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The idea of horror is gone - replaced by rather weak arena type shooter - get to the big room/courtyard, kill insane amount of monsters appearing from nowhere and move to another romm/courtyard. Oh, and kill some bosses almost impossible to kill without finding a glitch in between. Only two PARTS of episode 6 (episodes are called intervals, 8 of them in total) can stand to two before games, but those are very, very short - quickly returning to "Serious Sam" type shooter. But - while "Seriuos Sam" was funny, this one is only annoying. Graphics are OK I guess, music is lame, but doesn't really disturb you. The new cover system does - it's not helping, it's only the great way to get killed. And story - it's not frightening at all. Finally - the game is short - I am not anytype of hardcore gamer - rather lame - and it took me only 13 hours, including numerous repeats on bosses... I believe really trained gamer would finish it in one, maybe two evenings. So - leave this one, no need to play it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/csabber3/recommended/21100/","csabber3","Green Lantern","http://steamcommunity.com/id/csabber3/","174 products in account","Day 1 Studios gave the new F.E.A.R. game the refreshing stimulus the franchise has deserved after the second entry. While F.E.A.R. 2 was a solid FPS it was also old with ageing mechanics that couldn't held up against the best in the genre. The latest game became modernish with updated gameplay mechanics. On one hand it was a good decision (it had to be done), on other side it isn't unique enough to separate itself from the competition.\n\nF.3.A.R starts off 8 months after the second game. Point Man is our protagonist once again and he has to team up with his long gone brother, Fettel to get out of a prison and find his squad mate, Jin, who is in danger. Paranormal activities are a big part of this game too. Only this time around Alma isn't the antagonist, but something called the Creep. The story of the game won't leave any deep marks in you. It's flat and uninteresting. It's hard to take the story seriously when it doesn't prove its worthiness. Your personal goal will be reaching checkpoints after checkpoints to beat campaign. And it will be done after just around 6 hours. It's a shame really because with a more intriguing story this game could have made a mark.\n\nLuckily F.E.A.R. 3 isn't short on content. Not at all. After completing the campaign you can kill your time with various game modes. Many of them are essentially a modified version of the original campaign, but the changes made in those modes are not only worth a try but also great fun. The campaign is made of 8 intervals, each of them takes around 30-45 minutes to complete. After completing an interval you can replay it as Point Man or Fetter with all its unique psychic abilities. He has the ability to posses common enemies. You'll appreciate the change of pace.\n\nAlso, you can hop in a co-op campaign with your friend. One controls Fettel the other Point Man. It isn't a novelty at all, but great to see the developer putting in the game options like this. When you exploit everything the single player modes can offer there is a multiplayer option in the game. Sadly the multiplayer of the third game was never as popular as the first game's MP. If you want to try this option most likely you have to play with your own friends as very few gamers are left playing F.3.A.R. over the internet.\n\nMoving to different territories, the looks of the game are passable. It's isn't a beautiful, nor a bad looking game. To its defense they put more emphasis on minor details, so this time a book on a table will actually look like one instead of a bunch of blurred pixels. The gameplay has been completely refreshed. The previous game in the franchise was getting old and set back by wrong decisions during the development. Not this game though. It feels like a modern shooter where you bullets do matter. When you shoot a soldier in this feet he grabs it or tumbles and the gunfight is much more vivid and powerful. Day 1 made the right decisions to cut the useless features and refresh the remaining ones. It's a great shooter, but beyond that it offers nothing more. Nothing that could differentiate this game from the others.\n\nFear in F.E.A.R. 3 is almost non existent. There are moments here and there when you'll look around suspiciously, but that's about it. The franchise has switched genres over the years. From psychological horror it became a solid action oriented shooter. We can't say it was a bad decision, but we can say that there isn't many horror games in the market while there's a legion of action shooters to choose from; good, bad or worse. It's a pity that in this era a franchise has to get more action oriented to survive, and sometimes even that might not be enough. Again, F.E.A.R. 3 is a great shooter and it definitely benefited from the changes made around it, but the industry and the gamers might not.\n\nRating: 80/100; Replay Value: 3/5; To Beat: 6 hours; Played on: normal.","December 15, 2013","true","6.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

When playing arcadey-style shooters, I expect fast, fluid and responsive combat. F.E.A.R. 3 has none of that.\n\nGraphically, the game is laughable, looking like an Xbox 360/PS3 launch title at best. The atmosphere is foggy and ugly, and is nowhere near as immersive as the dark, claustrophobia-inducing corridors and areas that the original F.E.A.R. harboured. The game is completely lacking in the horror department, resorting only to cheap jump scares instead of the subtle, eerie hallucinations and sound effects that the made the first game so terrifying. Even the presence of a bloodied, heavily pregnant Alma failed to make me jump and cower behind my chair in terror.\n\nMultiplayer is quite fun. F**king Run is intense and challenging enough on its own, but the sluggish gunplay made experiencing it nothing short of a nightmare; no pun intended. On the plus side, most servers were lag-free and performed reasonably well.\n\nApologies for the short review, but I really can’t say much more about F.E.A.R. 3. The game was so boring and awkward to play that I simply couldn’t bring myself to play more than a few hours of it. Half-decent multiplayer and a woeful singleplayer campaign does not justify a playthrough, even at the €5 price tag that I bought this game at. A waste of money and time. It truly is the black sheep of the F.E.A.R. series, and anyone who enjoyed the previous two iterations would do well to stay away from this tosh.\n\nBeing one of the worst FPS games I have played in recent memory, F.E.A.R. 3 gets a 3/10.","April 24, 2014","false","3.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The enemy AI really shines when you see it actively trying to flank your friend or yourself, asymetric coop is tons of fun and its just a much better, overall experience.\n\n- A controller, I know many will think playing an fps with a controller when you have a perfectly good M/KB setup is some sort of sacrilege, but sadly the game has mouse acceleration and little bit of autoaiming enabled (with no ways to remove them), also the FoV is locked to 65 (can be changed by editing a config file), so a controller will just give you the better experience (sadly on screen inputs are locked to the keyboard, oh well).\n\n- A complete disregard for the prequels, Fear 3 is not scary (at all) but it has a good atmosphere, the story is mediocre at best, try to think of it not as a Fear game but as a good coop game.\n\nOkay let me wrap this up quick, still a good game, some of the multiplayer game modes can be fun if you can get some people in them (online is dead), graphics are nice, so is sound, game has decent graphic options, input options are lacking, no button mapping for the controller (default is pretty good tho).

In a nutshell FEAR 3 feels like Call of Duty with a ghost that appears every so often.  FEAR 1 & 2 had major moments of scares and making you feel like you were always haunted.  FEAR 3 is just bad guys, bad guys and more bad guys...then Alma shows up and is gone.  I acknowledge that FEAR 3 is a shooter game but I think it concentrates too much on shooting and not the horror.  Furthermore, I'm upset that you can shoot an enemy in the face a couple of times then he gets back up and shoots and granades you a dozen times.  The AI is a bit too smart as well.  Before you round the corner they're already shooting at you!  Forget ducking for cover because they seem to have an unlimited supply of granades.  By the time I reached a "ghost moment" I was so frustrated that I was basically like, whatever Alma just get outta my way go haunt someone who cares!  The creepy moments are very brief and and they're ok but far from great.  If you like horror games stay away from this, it'll be a letdown.\n\nPros:\n+Controls (after changing them from default)\n+Ablility to use cover during a firefight\n+Weapons\n\nCons:\n-Graphics (worse than FEAR 2 for some reason)\n-Enemies keep spawning in some places\n-Enemies hard to kill even at point blank\n-No real scary moments, not a true horror game\n-For a shooter/horror game it's boring.","July 7, 2014","false","2.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

I'll admit I've played (approximately) half of the original FEAR, and completed FEAR 3, so I will only reveal story information without ending spoilers pertaining to FEAR 3.\n\nYou start out nine months after the ending of the first two games, captured protagonist known as the point man held in south america works to escape with the assistance of Paxton Fettel after interrogation. Brothers in arms Point Man who is the Wolverine-like protagonist and Paxton a spectre. During their escape, they discover that they are being hunted along with their mother, Alma. The creature seeking to kill the family was created based on the evil memories of the mother, and this evil has formed a strange paranoia over Fairport. In order to restore the balance, the brothers set out to destroy any memories associated to the past to weaken the monster hunting them.\n\nThe game sets a good base story and introduces a very cool horror element. There was some supernatural element introduced that didn't really fit but the actual horror side of the supernatural was a perfect buttery fit and it got a couple of good jumps from me. The story is particularly hard to follow until you get three quarters in but once you get there the story and gameplay make much more sense and the game goes from being somewhat random to making sense.\n\nAfter completing all but the last few chapters, the game really picks up and becomes a lot more fun. The horror elements in the last chapter were the highlight as the story became very clear in this chapter and it really felt like an action horror where as the rest of the game was scattered between action and horror but never the two. The game is short, sweet, but it's also lacking in story and fun comparring to its original - of which I recall having a lot of fun in my youth. I have heard from a lot of people complaining that this game fell short of its original, I can agree and understand, but there's no denying you'll have fun in this game because you will.\n\nI feel it more of a casual game due to the points system, it feels like it was created for its points system and not its story. Yje lack of story in the beginning, the point system and its linearity all contribute to the downgrade of this games reception to me. It does become repetitive when all you need to do is shoot until everybody is dead, move into next section and repeat the entire game. I have an issue with that, but there's no real interaction or immersive features.\n\nIt's a solid game and it runs well on old technology. Getting a jump or two makes you smile, and the whole composure results in a great story and a lot of fun.","December 10, 2014","true","8.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/csabber3/recommended/21100/","csabber3","Green Lantern","http://steamcommunity.com/id/csabber3/","174 products in account","Day 1 Studios gave the new F.E.A.R. game the refreshing stimulus the franchise has deserved after the second entry. While F.E.A.R. 2 was a solid FPS it was also old with ageing mechanics that couldn't held up against the best in the genre. The latest game became modernish with updated gameplay mechanics. On one hand it was a good decision (it had to be done), on other side it isn't unique enough to separate itself from the competition.\n\nF.3.A.R starts off 8 months after the second game. Point Man is our protagonist once again and he has to team up with his long gone brother, Fettel to get out of a prison and find his squad mate, Jin, who is in danger. Paranormal activities are a big part of this game too. Only this time around Alma isn't the antagonist, but something called the Creep. The story of the game won't leave any deep marks in you. It's flat and uninteresting. It's hard to take the story seriously when it doesn't prove its worthiness. Your personal goal will be reaching checkpoints after checkpoints to beat campaign. And it will be done after just around 6 hours. It's a shame really because with a more intriguing story this game could have made a mark.\n\nLuckily F.E.A.R. 3 isn't short on content. Not at all. After completing the campaign you can kill your time with various game modes. Many of them are essentially a modified version of the original campaign, but the changes made in those modes are not only worth a try but also great fun. The campaign is made of 8 intervals, each of them takes around 30-45 minutes to complete. After completing an interval you can replay it as Point Man or Fetter with all its unique psychic abilities. He has the ability to posses common enemies. You'll appreciate the change of pace.\n\nAlso, you can hop in a co-op campaign with your friend. One controls Fettel the other Point Man. It isn't a novelty at all, but great to see the developer putting in the game options like this. When you exploit everything the single player modes can offer there is a multiplayer option in the game. Sadly the multiplayer of the third game was never as popular as the first game's MP. If you want to try this option most likely you have to play with your own friends as very few gamers are left playing F.3.A.R. over the internet.\n\nMoving to different territories, the looks of the game are passable. It's isn't a beautiful, nor a bad looking game. To its defense they put more emphasis on minor details, so this time a book on a table will actually look like one instead of a bunch of blurred pixels. The gameplay has been completely refreshed. The previous game in the franchise was getting old and set back by wrong decisions during the development. Not this game though. It feels like a modern shooter where you bullets do matter. When you shoot a soldier in this feet he grabs it or tumbles and the gunfight is much more vivid and powerful. Day 1 made the right decisions to cut the useless features and refresh the remaining ones. It's a great shooter, but beyond that it offers nothing more. Nothing that could differentiate this game from the others.\n\nFear in F.E.A.R. 3 is almost non existent. There are moments here and there when you'll look around suspiciously, but that's about it. The franchise has switched genres over the years. From psychological horror it became a solid action oriented shooter. We can't say it was a bad decision, but we can say that there isn't many horror games in the market while there's a legion of action shooters to choose from; good, bad or worse. It's a pity that in this era a franchise has to get more action oriented to survive, and sometimes even that might not be enough. Again, F.E.A.R. 3 is a great shooter and it definitely benefited from the changes made around it, but the industry and the gamers might not.\n\nRating: 80/100; Replay Value: 3/5; To Beat: 6 hours; Played on: normal.","December 15, 2013","true","6.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

See my FEAR and FEAR2 reviews for necessary context, but the pros are few and far between here:\n\n1) Even better graphics, but lackluster, repetitive and at times confusing level design.\n\n2) Genuinely bad AI.  It also seemed like there was some fairly cheesy enemy spawning going on, and while it was sometimes hard to tell, there is no doubt that the scary-good AI of the original game is gone for good.\n\n3) Gunplay is definitely a serious regression from FEAR and FEAR2.  Everything has a very arcadey feel to it now, which is only compounded by the braindead AI and level layouts.  Plus, you can only carry two weapons and a small number of grenades, and your health now regenerates.  I play games like this INSTEAD of Call of Duty and the like, since they reduce the difficulty and tension pretty drastically for me.  Walked into an ambush and are on the verge of death?  No problem!  Just crouch behind a box for a few seconds, emerge from cover in slow-mo, and faceroll the AI.\n\n4) Achievements. Why are there achievements unlocking in-game, in real time, as I play a story-driven horror FPS?  Immersion is critical in games like this, and fewer things take me out of that more than random unlocks for "X slow-mo kills" or the like popping up on my screen during firefights or scare moments.  Too much of this felt like priming players to jump into MP, rather than to enjoy the SP mode.\n\n5) Not at all scary.  There are definitely some disturbing and interesting revelations, but many of the plot developments are spoon-fed to the player, rather than being discovered and experienced organically.  Even the things that do come about more naturally still felt forced on some level and certainly weren't frightening.\n\n6) The game's final act is a huge disappointment story-wise.  Again, I don't want to spoil it verbatim here, but I did not feel that the Point Man's "good ending"--which I view as the game's intended ending--really made that much sense.  We never really understand the mind-state of Alma, and nor is her resolution or the implications of the child ever really made clear.  Fettel's "bad" ending certainly followed more logically, so perhaps its more apocalyptic and nihilistic tenor is truer to the nature of the series overall.\n\nSadly, this game largely self-destructed where it counts, leading to a rather unenjoyable and ignoble end to what could and should have been a great series.  Take a pass and go play the original FEAR again instead.","October 30, 2014","false","1.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I would sum what happens in F.E.A.R 3, but the story is so forgettable that I can't remember what happened in it, and I beat it twice. Apparently the two brothers have to go and stop Alma's baby from being born, but the game throws in a multiple ending that rewards whoever was the "best brother." That means A. you need to beat the story mode twice to get all endings or B. Play the whole 6 HOUR story mode in co op.\n\nGameplay is dumbed down from the last 2 F.E.A.R games. There is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ cover system, you can only carry 2 guns, health regenerates, and F.E.A.R's top of the line AI has been reduced to standard FPS AI.\n\nThe worst part is that the game isn't scary. F.E.A.R 2 wasn't all that scary, but it had great gameplay to make up for it. F.E.A.R 3 has nothing going for it besides a co-op that, once again, doesn't make it scary. I don't know what went through WB's head to get rid of Monolith [Creators of F.E.A.R] and replace them with some unknown studio that never heard of F.E.A.R.\n\nIf you really love the F.E.A.R games like me, just make up in your head what happens in the story, it would probably be better than what they came up with.\n\nAlso F.3.A.R... really guys?\n\n\n","September 19, 2014","false","10.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

As a single-player experience it does almost nothing to improve on the series’ formula, keeping mostly the same enemies, similar mech suits, almost all the same weapons, and the same scare tactics. As a co-op campaign, the game becomes significantly more interesting, but we’ll talk about that in a bit. Despite the lack of changes to the formula, the shooting is still solid, the slo-mo is still satisfying, the gore is nice and crunchy, and the weapons have hefty power. The level design still hasn’t strayed all that much from the much-criticized “gray corridors” of the first FEAR – sure, you explore suburban houses, a Costco-like store, a huge bridge, and even a forest, but much of the time you’re still in monochrome corridors.","February 25, 2015","true","0.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The gameplay has now become a mix of Parkour and fast paced gunfights, the goal being to make the highest score by replaying the same levels, over and over.\n\nInterestingly, the campaign can be played in co-op, but this makes the game a little too easy, so I would recommend to finish the game in solo first. The game also features some very original multiplayer game modes. In F*king Run, up to six players are tasked to escape from an ever advancing fog of death, while the players are being pursued by an increasing number and tougher enemies. This game mode is exceptionally fun and challenging. Contractions is a survival mode tasking the players to barricade themselves from waves of possessed enemies.

You first have to complete the game as 'point man'. This character allows you to slow down time while you blast away your enemies. The other character is Paxton Fettel who has the ability to possess almost any enemy in the game.\n\n+ A cover based system in a first person shooter never seems to work out, yet this game handles the feature nicely. With a single press of a button  you can hide behind cover and easily pop out and shoot your enemies.\n\n+ By completing challenges you acquire experience which is then used to level up your character. Challenges include killing a certain amount of enemies with a weapon, getting headshots, staying in slow-mo for a certain amount of time etc. It's a nice addition and it helps you change up your play style so you're not constantly relying on the same tricks over and over again.\n\n+ I feel the AI has improved (yet still lacking to the first FEAR), enemies flank, hide, take cover and feel like a genuine threat when facing them.\n\n+Variety of different weapons and grenades\n\n+The shooting mechanics feel good, going into slow-mo and shooting enemies is always fun. The game also introduces sections where you ride a mech to change up the gameplay.\n\nThe Average:\n\nOn a technical level the graphics are decent. Textures are solid, lighting and shadows look decent however artistically the game feels bland and uninspired. Poor color usage and levels that feel and look the same despite being in different environments doesn't help either.\n\nThe story is decent but it really is starting to feel convoluted at this point.\n\nGame will provide around 5-7 hours for one playthrough. Multiplayer and playing through the campaign as the second character can extend playtime for a bit.\n\nThe game features some multiplayer modes that can be played in single player and extend your game time. The problem is that multiplayer is dead which is sad given that some of these modes looks really fun to play.\n\nThe Bad\n\n- multiplayer is dead which also means getting certain achievements is now impossible\n\n- no local co-op\n\n\nConclusion\n\nThe more FEAR games we get the farther we move away from what made the original so great. This game lacks even less horror elements and tactical shooting from the previous entries and is essentially a straight up first person shooter with the slow-mo ability. I don't consider this a bad game but compared to the last 2 entries it feels like it took 2 steps back and 1 step forward.\n","October 21, 2015","true","12.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I've seen people say the co-op makes this game bearable, but I found this to be completely untrue.\n\nMy first playthrough was co-op with my best friend and as my Steam hour count shows, we couldn't make it past the first few hours. What we played was just another mass-manufactured action shooter with none of the attention to detail of the original.\n\nThe original FEAR was not perfect. However, what in lacked in level design and enemy variety it made up for with superior gunplay, spectacular effects and lighting, and a haunting atmosphere. FEAR 3 has none of that.

As a fear game it is quite unfaithful.\n\nThe game itself is actually pretty fun to play, and the multiplayer contractions mode was really cool. Basically you fight waves of illusionary soldiers/creatures, and between waves you can repair barricades and collect weapon caches.\n\nThe single player is trash, almost entirely due to the fact that it's so unfaithful to the original. From the mood to the guns and atmosphere, it's weird. Like uncannily weird. You spend a lot of time fighting in spaces like suburbs, supermarkets and airports. Where as in FEAR 1 and 2 the game was  more localized around industrial areas and downtown cityscapes, it feels very weird to spend your time fighting in these much less industrial areas.\n\nThis game is also not scary at all. I really don't remember anything in the game that was legitimately scary in the same vein of the first two games. But to be fair I also feel like the game ended up way past its prime, I think the original theme was already played out to death, the way the story pans out in this last game makes light of the entire supernatural threat from the first two games.\n\nSo basically, it's call of duty with spooky stuff, except the spooky stuff is on your side.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/valkinsenn/recommended/21100/","valkinsenn","~S9~ Valkinsenn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/valkinsenn/","176 products in account",""F.E.A.R. 3."\nA review by Richard Valkinsenn.\n\nOften stylized as F.3.A.R., this game serves as the official conclusion to the action-packed F.E.A.R. trilogy. Thrilling, chilling, and packed with just the right mix of tension-filled atmosphere and adrenaline-fueled action, F.E.A.R. 3 serves as a clear reminder that first-person shooters can be a lot of fun... even if their visual presentation leaves something to be desired, and the gameplay seems a bit cliche.\n\nF.E.A.R. 3 follows the story of Point Man and Paxton Fettel months after the events of the original F.E.A.R. in which the former is captured by Armacham and the latter frees him from their interrogation, assisting him in his escape. The two form an uneasy alliance as they fight their way through Armacham forces, dangerous psychotics, and sinister paranormal apparitions, amid an impending apocalypse and a growing distrust between the two protagonists.\n\nStylistically, the game oozes atmospheric tension throughout it's fun, albeit short campaign. The world around the player constantly teeters on the edge of impending doom, and just about every location in the game is deserted, save for the game's vicious--and often tough--enemies. Voice acting in the game is spot-on and believable, although much of the supporting cast ends up feeling forced and rather one-dimensional. Even characters from previous entries in the series end up falling short. Thankfully, however, the two protagonists of the game, especially Fettel, will not likely be forgotten soon.\n\nGameplay is F.E.A.R. 3's strongest suit. Though it may include such modern--and now admittedly cliche--conventions like ironsights and regenerating health, the controls and mechanics feel solid and responsive, even though experienced players will likely not use the game's first-person cover system. F.E.A.R. 3's solo/co-op campaign features a tough, numerous, and varied cast of intelligent foes opposite of the player, ranging from Armacham mercenaries to blade-wielding psychotics and even armored battlemechs. However, the player's odds are even, as Point Man can slow his perception of time, and Paxton Fettel can telekinetically suspend and crush his foes in midair, and even possess them for a brief amount of time. The blood-soaked campaign is also unapologetically violent, featuring buckets of gore in almost every scene, in addition to a bone-crunching arsenal that allows players to literally rip enemies to pieces, reduce them to red vapor, and even nail them to walls. F.E.A.R. 3 also features competitive and cooperative online multiplayer modes apart from the campaign which are fun, even though both maps and modes are few in number.\n\nVisually, the game is a mixed bag. The game's atmosphere-rich environments often suffer from low texture quality, even though the game's weapons all feature (mostly) high-quality texturing and design. Lighting and level design in F.E.A.R. 3 are generally very good with logical paths and cover points carved out for the player, in addition to some very moody lighting schemes. However, sometimes the level design can be confusing, especially without an ingame guide, and the lighting sometimes suffers from appearing rather flat in one too many places.\n\nIn summary, if you're willing to forgive F.E.A.R. 3's at-times subpar visual presentation and arguably cliche mechanics, then the game serves as an exceedingly fun time both offline and on, and even manages to present the player with an engaging, albeit short, first-person single player narrative.\n\nFinal verdict:\n7/10\n\nThis has been a review by Richard Valkinsenn.\nThank you for your attention.","August 10, 2014","true","34.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Quite obviously, It's the 3rd game in the F.E.A.R franchise, which, one would expect, would say everything. But in all honesty, it doesn't - in fact, the third installment of the F.E.A.R franchise is much more akin to the generic first person shooter than the trouser-browning horror shooter that the F.E.A.R name is otherwise known for.\n\nThe gameplay is, to put it in one word, generic. You have guns, they go bang, there are a LOT of enemies to shoot with them, same old. However, the genericness is tempered slightly with a very nice cover system, the slow-mo mechanic which is a mainstay of the F.E.A.R franchise, and the occasional creepy moment, though undoubtedly nothing as trouser-wetting as the previous games in the series, which I have admittedly not actually played a lot of. There is also some geo-mod, but this is needless and hinders more than it helps. However, the game is still relatively fun despite the genericness and shortcomings.\n\nThe story is confusing. Whilst playing through the game I had little idea of what was actually going on, but from what I could gather, Alma, the creepy little F.E.A.R mainstay, has become pregnant for whatever reason, and the main character, the "Point Man" and his brother Paxton Fettel, who was killed in F.E.A.R 1 and who has somehow returned, have to find her and... well, Fettel wants to eat the child and Point Man wants to destroy it. That's as much as I could gather.\n\nThe game takes about 6 to 7 hours to beat, though this is somewhat artificially extended by the game's difficulty. I was playing on "Commando" (Normal) difficulty, and some areas of the game were heavily confusing and others were incredibly difficult, particularly one section where I had to defeat a massive mech which could kill me in a few shots and tear any cover you might choose to use to pieces, and also another where I was attacked by TWO of the most annoying enemy in the game, which needless to say was frustrating.\n\nTo summarise, F.E.A.R 3 is generic, difficult, short, confusing and has stupidly large numbers of incredibly annoying enemies. I'd reccommend this game only if you're a fan of first-person shooters in general and like a challenge, in which case you may find it quite fun (Though you may find yourself not wanting anyone to mention phase casters to you ever again), otherwise save your cash and buy another good FPS, or better, one of the prior F.E.A.R games.","May 19, 2015","false","9.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jocosity/recommended/21100/","jocosity","Communist "Joseph Ballin" Layton","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jocosity/","920 products in account","This game wasn't actually made by Monolith; it was developed by Day One Studios, the studio that was previously only responsible for making the console ports of FEAR 1 and its expansions. It shows, in a lot of ways. The levels are much more linear, you're limited to two weapons, and the graphics are arguably worse than FEAR 2's and maybe even FEAR 1's. The story is barely coherent at best (which isn't helped by the fact that despite FEAR 3 having actual cutscenes, Pointman is still a silent protagonist who only communicates through furiously scrunching his eyebrows), and you don't even get a clear goal or an idea of where you're actually going until around halfway through the game's 4 hour campaign. The only aspect of the game that's anything interesting is the co-op system, in which the two players are cooperating but still loosely competing against each other to decide which ending they get, which works a lot better than it does in games that somehow manage to be even worse than this one like Call of Juarez: The Cartel. And that's a good thing, because the only way I can recommend even considering playing this game is if you have a friend to play it with, though even then it's only a loose recommendation since this game is really only that fun under the "any game is fun with a friend" rule. This game barely has enough content to be a hard sell if it were priced at $10 or $15 like the first two games are, but at $20 it's absolutely not worth picking up unless you just really want to suffer through an evening with a friend and have expended all other available options.","July 16, 2015","false","4.8"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","7","14","2","0"

I haven't experienced one glitch or bug and I've played through the campaign twice the point is it's been years and my hopes of FEAR 4 Have sadly come to an end, I really hope one day FEAR 4 May come true but the Developers will need as much support as they can get, Overall this is how I'm gonna end my review, FEAR 3 Was a great game, great design, development and the Setting even sometimes got me a little depressed on the inside which made it all the more better.

If you like FPS, Horror, and Gore you should give this a shot. It has a solid FPS feel and being able to play Fettle gives it a new twist. I am playing backwards through the Fear series but it is really entertaining. I think it needs an update though to give Fettle more bonuses because Pointman seems to always out score him no matter what you do.\n\nI haven't counted but I believe it's because Pointman has more opportunities to score points and Fettle has to posses a body to even compete. Fettle is really fun to play just don't count on getting the ending you want based on Fettle due to the unbalance. Played through COOP with a friend over seas and the network code was flawless. Highly recomend for a good time just don't try and compete for favorite son, it's biased.","December 6, 2013","true","34.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Extraction Point,  F.E.A.R. Perseus Mandate, and knowing how sequels often get dilluted in the development process, I was surprised to see that F.E.A.R. 2 is just as good as the original with actual improvements to the lighting, sound, and gameplay that don't detriment the trademark ambience of the classic F.E.A.R., which makes sense because the entire franchise up to this point was developed by Monolith as a competitive PC market shooter.\n\nUnfortunately,   F.E.A.R. 3 offers none of this.   Because it's a blatant console port.   The lighting is absolutely horrid.  There's some ridiculous grainy mist all over the place which apparently  serves to dress up the fact that the architecture and lighting are completely inadequate for a game in this series, and why is that?  Because it was developed for underpowered fanboy consoles.  F.E.A.R. 1 had better graphics than this, because it was developed for PCs that came out BEFORE PS3, and XBOX 360, which strongly underlines the fact of how pathetic consoles and their games are.  The storyline is completely thrown out the window on this one too. There's no explanation of how Pointman ended up in a prison cell, but we're supposed to be pacified by the appearance of a badly animated cartoon-like Fettel with a  bullet which miraculously stopped in a crater on his forehead. Odd, because I distinctly remember blowing his brains completely out in F.E.A.R. Is this a way to help the clueless console fanboys who didn't play the first two F.E.A.R. games figure out that Fettel was killed by a gunshot to the head and Pointman did it?  Apparently so.  But let's not neglect to mention that the voiceovers for the replica soldiers is equally as disconcerting.  They talk like normal people.   They are not normal people.  As we learned in F.E.A.R. 2 these Replica soldiers under their masks are facially disfigured cheap human clones with little education or vocal skill, and their voice should be gruffy, low and borderline animalistic.  In F.E.A.R. 3 they talk like professional sports announcers at the International Table Tennis Tournament. When you shoot them, you get a yellow hit marker, and if you squint really hard you might see a tinge of red blood. Where is the gore?  But within 10 minutes you'll also be able to figure out that the introduction of Alma in this game is about as frightening as an angry poodle. Another opportunity wasted.  The use of music in the game is done poorly, and the music itself is completely uninspiring.  Another opportunity wasted. Go into settings.  That's right, auto-aim is on by default, because this is a console port.  All this culminates into F.E.A.R. 3 being a total let down and downright disgrace to what is otherwise a legendary franchise loved by many. When will game publishers learn to stop destroying great concepts in the name of wider market audiences and temporary profit gains?  WB clearly took a page from the EA and Activision book on F.E.A.R. 3 and it's no surprise we'll never see another real F.E.A.R. game again...","April 14, 2014","false","0.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","2"

Extraction Point,  F.E.A.R. Perseus Mandate, and knowing how sequels often get dilluted in the development process, I was surprised to see that F.E.A.R. 2 is just as good as the original with actual improvements to the lighting, sound, and gameplay that don't detriment the trademark ambience of the classic F.E.A.R., which makes sense because the entire franchise up to this point was developed by Monolith as a competitive PC market shooter.\n\nUnfortunately,   F.E.A.R. 3 offers none of this.   Because it's a blatant console port.   The lighting is absolutely horrid.  There's some ridiculous grainy mist all over the place which apparently  serves to dress up the fact that the architecture and lighting are completely inadequate for a game in this series, and why is that?  Because it was developed for underpowered fanboy consoles.  F.E.A.R. 1 had better graphics than this, because it was developed for PCs that came out BEFORE PS3, and XBOX 360, which strongly underlines the fact of how pathetic consoles and their games are.  The storyline is completely thrown out the window on this one too. There's no explanation of how Pointman ended up in a prison cell, but we're supposed to be pacified by the appearance of a badly animated cartoon-like Fettel with a  bullet which miraculously stopped in a crater on his forehead. Odd, because I distinctly remember blowing his brains completely out in F.E.A.R. Is this a way to help the clueless console fanboys who didn't play the first two F.E.A.R. games figure out that Fettel was killed by a gunshot to the head and Pointman did it?  Apparently so.  But let's not neglect to mention that the voiceovers for the replica soldiers is equally as disconcerting.  They talk like normal people.   They are not normal people.  As we learned in F.E.A.R. 2 these Replica soldiers under their masks are facially disfigured cheap human clones with little education or vocal skill, and their voice should be gruffy, low and borderline animalistic.  In F.E.A.R. 3 they talk like professional sports announcers at the International Table Tennis Tournament. When you shoot them, you get a yellow hit marker, and if you squint really hard you might see a tinge of red blood. Where is the gore?  But within 10 minutes you'll also be able to figure out that the introduction of Alma in this game is about as frightening as an angry poodle. Another opportunity wasted.  The use of music in the game is done poorly, and the music itself is completely uninspiring.  Another opportunity wasted. Go into settings.  That's right, auto-aim is on by default, because this is a console port.  All this culminates into F.E.A.R. 3 being a total let down and downright disgrace to what is otherwise a legendary franchise loved by many. When will game publishers learn to stop destroying great concepts in the name of wider market audiences and temporary profit gains?  WB clearly took a page from the EA and Activision book on F.E.A.R. 3 and it's no surprise we'll never see another real F.E.A.R. game again...","April 14, 2014","false","0.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","2"

If you forget about the horror element, what you have here is an extremely accomplished shooter - cover system is great, slo-mo works well, enemy AI is good.  The horror elements are basically limited to lots of melee-type characters that try and swarm you.  Although the warehouse/shop level did doa  pretty good job of buidling suspense before the actual bad guys turned up.\n\nThere is a bit of replay value to be had here as well, you can replay the game as the murderous ghost once you've completed a level as point-man.  I did a couple of levels with Fettel before I decided that while being novel, that character didn't add enough for me to replay the same story with a different set of abilities - those with more time on their hands may well feel differently.\n\nSummary: forget the FEAR back story and enjoy a polished shooter.","April 21, 2014","true","10.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/goldenkitten/recommended/21100/","goldenkitten","Goldenkitten","http://steamcommunity.com/id/goldenkitten/","627 products in account","This game gets an unfair bad wrap. Long story short; is it as good as the first two? No. But is it a bad game? Also no. The issue arises from the fact that F.E.A .R 3 tries to be an entirely different genre of shooter from the previous two games, and while this can and has alienated some fans I think it’s unfair to call it a bad game if taken on its own merits. No it isn’t the best game in the series, but it’s far from a sub-par game if viewed at alone.\n\nThe previous two relied heavily on narrative and while neither was truly scary they did an admirable job of crafting a permeable atmosphere of the supernatural. The third game on the other hand goes in very heavy-handed with the action and mostly relies on flickering lights and ghostly apparitions as its one sole link to suggest it’s actually trying to be a horror game at all. There are a few segments (the third mission comes to mind) where it seems like a totally different team took over and the game steps into the overboard gore and insanity of the previous two games but these are unfortunately short-lived and not evocative of the whole experience. Additionally most of the story is reserved for cut-scenes tacked on to the start and end of missions with most of mid-mission exposition from the previous entries missing\n\nAnd don’t get me wrong these are real negatives. That said the gunplay on offer here is very streamlined and of a high quality, the environments while not of a superb graphical level are very well crafted and have a lot of details, and I’m a big fan of how they handled “leveling up” to give you small benefits over the previous games “Boosters” (which had you combing each environment or more likely running off to a FAQ).  Additionally a system in which you gain points based on accomplishing tasks like killing enemies with a certain weapon, taking cover, or using slo-mo a certain amount of time are another factor that removes the horror out of the game, and yet at the same time I find it hard to fault the system as it’s genuinely fun to try and get the highest score you can. The focus of the game on co-op seems very misplaced for the series but the fit the actual game itself.\n\nAll-in-all this is a perfectly serviceable shooter that has more choice and depth than the average modern military shooter. It’s unfortunate that it steps so far away from its lineage and I can see why people take issue with this fact. But if you stop trying to lament how different it is at every step you’ll still find a perfectly fun and working package here.","January 20, 2014","true","16.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The game takes on a new form, almost entirely, giving the player much more room and ability with weapons, reflexes and cover shooting; the game is promiscuous about enemy design and strategy, giving a lot of the momentum of the fights away to who has the bigger gun--a lot like Halo 3, however in Halo 3, Brutes attack you without necessary consent from superiors, in F.E.A.R.3, some enemies won't be as aggressive if you are faced with a mech, or a soldier with greater weaponry. The A.I. in this game pales very clearly in comparison to the original. Most enemies run right at you, knowing you have an advantage in accuracy and dexterity. The game tries to compensate for this by throwing more enemies at you, in bigger and burlier fashion, though, your reflex mode (now almost Godmode), gives you complete superiority in nearly every situation the game offers.\n\nThis game wraps up the Armacham story and hastily. Something about Paxton Fettel living on in your psyche, due to Alma's pervasive ability and extrasennsory ability, allowing you direct psychic link with Fettel and some dead clone soldiers. Knowing that, it seems like a very indirect way to tie up a story about encountering a hellish creature, given that Fettel was the primary antagonist of the original game up until the end, and Harlan Wade was your antithesis, it would have made more sense to undermine the future of Alma, and give her a much desired explication, of her past, who she possessed and how she survived so long, giving necessary closure to a series that basically, revolved around her.\n\nThe game is gorgeous, parallel to games like Left for Dead 2, and Tribes Ascend. There's a great attention to detail and even better presentation, if you're up for that sort of thing but this game is no Metro 2033.\n\nAs a sequel, this game falls flat on its face. As a game, it's amazing and should be played by anyone who enjoys Call of Duty, Serious Sam or any FPS that's mildly hectic. A must play for F.E.A.R. fans, to figure out what exactly makes the original games so good.","July 3, 2014","true","37.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

FEAR 3 brings some coop to the table through 2-sided mission design (play as Point Man or unlock/visit-another's-game as the ghostly Fettle) at the cost of extremely linear environments and dumb enemies. Any pretext of horror is gone, replaced by a mix of interesting "scary" environments and corridor-shooting. The game itself is WAY TOO SHORT (6 hrs).\n\nHowever, I still recommend FEAR 3 for two reasons: it finishes the "story" of the series and features first-person cover mechanics. I can't think of any other shooter that offers first-person cover on PC, and it's an interesting if limiting design choice. The shooting is also decent, although the gun models are too big (I usually don't care about that sort of thing).\n\nIf you want to see the end of this sadly reduced series, just get the game.","December 31, 2014","true","6.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Because I pirated it, and I bought this on sale for eight bucks which is roughly what I'd say this was worth. The graphics are pretty dated, the physics are very buggy, and the enviorments are insanly linear. Most of the fear is gone with only a few sections in the very beginning which were filled with pop out scares. The leveling system is dumb and god help me it feels like I have tunnel vision. This game makes you feel like you have a fov of 30. Fettel (the unlockable character) is basically a silly rehash of the main character with little added that's worthwhile. The story is cliche, dull, and feels irrelevant to the rest of the game. Who are these people? Why is she helping me? I only see them once the entire game? I will say, the action in the game is pretty decent and the game can be fun at times, but overall this game is a consolized let down. 6/10.","August 17, 2012","true","7.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It has times were the atmosphere is quite disturbing, but it is nowhere near as scary as the original. For those of you who have completed the original and all its expansions, this will be kind of a rehash of the 3rd expansion Perseus Mandate, only instead of fighting the merc group Nightcrawlers, you are fighting ATC corporate commandos. The story is of course different and like Project Origin, FEAR 3 ignores the original expansions  (Jin is still alive and such, Jankowski is not mentioned, but strangely your FEAR CO is still dead as he was in the Extraction Point Expansion)   You play as the Point Man from the original FEAR, and you fight Armacham as they struggle to cover up everything that went wrong in Fairpoint. You travel alongside your psychotic brother Paxton Fettel as you try to stop your mother Alma. Like I said, the game is a very solid action game, but it feels similar to many modern FPS shooters to were it feels like a shooting gallery. Enemies come at predictable patterns and can be easily outflanked and outmanuevered. You get rank ups for completing different challenges such as time spent in bullet time, weapon kills, and performing various manuever or enviromental kills. For each rank, you get a bonus in the form of more ammo, more health, etc. There are soul links hidden throughout the levels as well as dolls to get you additional XP. Finding them is not to difficult if you take the time to look around, but it kind of breaks up the actions a bit. This is similar to the original FEAR power-up system were you find health and reflex boosters.\n\nThere are times in the game were it pulls you out of the action to deal with various paranormal entities in the game (The Creep being a noteable one). I did not find this scary as much as annoying getting routinely cheapshotted in a random part of the level. This does not serve to build much atmosphere as the monster itself is not to frightening and dampens the flow of gameplay IMO. There are some nice scary moments particularly in interval 3-5 when you go back to Fairpoint. The ambience here is great and the disturbing denizens bring back memories of the psychos from the Condemned series. These were my favorite parts of the game by far. Toward the ending intervals... The action became more tedious then rewarding. Using Power Armor was fun when it was first introduced, but it becomes fustrating during the Bridge interval. I should also point out that you cannot initially play as Paxton Fettel and can only play as him if you beat an interval as the Point Man. Paxton Fettel can suspend, possess, or use his psychic powers in a variety of cool ways, which does add something new to the game. There are two endings depending on who you beat the game with obviously, and Paxton Fettel's abilities do warrant a second playthrough. If you do play CO-OP through the whole game, whoever has the highest score determines the ending adding some competative play to CO-OP.\n\nOverall, the SP was fun and despite its hiccups was solid. The story wrapped up kind of weak and left me somewhat confused regarding the future of the series as well as other questions such as  why did Alma die after giving birth to her child, and why would she even consider Point Man a choice to be her successor. Paxon Fettel seemed to share her  goals and had a special link with her mother growing up. I also felt that it was a missed opportunity to not fight Paxton let alone Alma instead of Harlan Wade (who died in the first game). Alma has become quite an iconic horror figure, and it is a shame she went out with such a dull roar given how she laid waste to any and all who stood in her way  All in all, story aside, the game is definately fun and disturbing. Wait for a sale and pick it up.\n\nSP Score: 7.8/10\n\nPros\n- Good gunplay\n- Great Atmosphere in some levels\n- Solid action game\n- Phase Commanders are a nice addition to the opposing force\n- Rank Up System is fun for completionists or people who like challenges\n- Multiple endings and Characters\n\nCons\n- Becomes repetative\n- ATC soldiers aren't as interesting or threatening as the Replica Forces\n- Not as impressive of an arsenal compared to the previous titles\n- Some ingame events break up the action and can become fustrating\n- Though disturbing and creepy, the story is rather weak and the wrap up was phoned in\n- Monsters are nowhere near as disturbing or creepy as the original FEAR games\n- Missed opportunity: ending boss battle","October 6, 2014","true","6.4"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

FEAR 3 is not a FEAR game at all and rather its a generic FPS. It was devd by Day 1 Studios, who handled the porting of FEAR 1 to PS3 and 360 (I originally played the PS3 version and have to say if memory serves it was a fine port that stayed true to the original game) and some games that were deemed mediocre when they came out and no one has ever talked about them since. So it makes sense that this game isn't a FEAR game aside from the name.\n\nThe story is based off of what has come about from the first two games but unlike the spooky and mysterious tone of the first two games and especially the first this one just starts off goofy and borderline stupid. Something you get from a comic...book....http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Niles ....whoever hired this guy to write a story while looking at his resume is undeserving of the job they had at the time. I mean look at this guy, he wears facial hair and dresses like hes 30 or more years younger than he is and it looks terrible. He just looks like a manchild or something. Comic book stories are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, so now the FEAR story line at 3 is goofy and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ like a comic book. 2 wasn't terribly great in anyway but 3 is just so so much worse especially story wise. Paxton Fettel is back and he is a ghost who helps you....this is literally the reason I don't read comic books. He dousn't help you like a beneficial all knowing god either, he just grabs you while your drowning and pulls you to safety kind of help. Steve Niles, if I ever end up near you...my fist requires a connection to your face.\n\nGameplay wise its actually not fun at all. Its a generic fps so you just go through the motions of killing emotionless brainless AI enemies that don't follow any of the logic rules that made 1 so good. Flanking enemies dousn't do much when they are watching you through walls or just snap to you. Ammo is rare enough as to create a major annoyance and considering enemies soak up hits you find yourself with less than a magazine of ammo most the time. Its just like every other generic FPS game you played than forgot about and never cared about again. Enemies don't react quite enough to make it feel like your doing anything to them when you shoot them and shooting in general dousn't feel terribly good. The choice of weapons is very limited aswell, which in past games and especially in 1 wasn't much of a problem since shooting and all that felt excellent and still do. I was gonna throw in a COD joke since thats so trendy these days but honestly, this is more generic and worse than COD.\n\nGraphics are dated compared to the original or even 2. Overly demanding without a reason on higher settings. Its blurry diarhea in general. Sound is nothing special either, meh.\n\nPresentation wise the game comes off as if it was meant for multiplayer, I feel thats where it would shine in COOP where you and a bro arn't really paying much attention to the game itself. But honestly the way its all setup gameplay wise where one player is Paxton and the other gets the gun is really boring for one player or maybe both. Its just a crappy game. I want to call it ♥♥♥♥ but honestly its not really quite that bad. Its just generic and not worth much to me.

Its like they looked at Fear 2 and tried to make it even more generic and casualised than 2. So now that makes Fear 3 miles away from Fear 1 and in the wrong direction with one shoe and no pants. Its just not a good FEAR game and a generic FPS in general.

I was disappointed by this one.\nDefinitely not up to the usual F.E.A.R level.  I don't like losing weapons after almost every interlude. , Also weapons have stupidly low levels of max ammunition. I wouldnt go into combat with only 150 rounds in my primary weapon, and I died quite a few times scrambling to try to find another weapon that had ammo.\nThe rendering isnt the most accurate. By which I mean you can be behind a barricade, and since this primitive game doesnt allow the lean feature, the only way to shoot from cover is to try to shoot over or expose your whole body shooting around.  If the center of a sandbag barricade is 4' high and the sides are 3' high, you cant shoot over the sides unless you aim higher than the center. You can SEE but you can't shoot. Also if throwing a grenade, the trajectory is as if you're tossing from your testicular level. I never carried 'nades by my 'nads. .\nThe worst part is the new "Captain?" who somehow craps out enemies relentlessly so that you need to try to kill him (and he takes a lot of killing), while dealing with attackers spawning from all around you.  THen at one point when you're low on ammo two of them spawn. They can appear anywhere, you cant escape them, so you die over and over.\nSince they've gone the ever-popular console route, there is no way to save manually so you'll have to replay over and over to get past the areas where the enemy keeps respawning 5 and 6 at a time. One other criticism. When mapping keys, you cant reuse keys for different functions if in a mech suit or on foot. So you have to try to find keys you can reach easily and remember what they are, or remap every time you switch from armor to foot. Yes, it's a minor criticism, but most good games have a separation between vehicle key mappings and on-foot key mappings since you obviously wont be doing the same actions in a vehicle as you would on foot.\nThis isn't the worst game ever as some have said, it's just not fun enough to put up with the negatives. When the bogus (I"d use something else that has B and S in it) level got too high, I just stopped playing. I'll wait before buying for any future "Day 1 Studios' games, checking online for HONEST reviews and not reading reviews posted by the seller.\nTWO GOOD THINGS: the challenges to level up added in single player are a pretty cool feature,. Even better, and the reason for the third start, is that the long cutscenes in between levels ARE SKIPPABLE! (pay attention Fart Cry duhvelopers).\nNOTE: I didn't try multiplayer, just single, campaign.","March 26, 2015","true","78.2"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

The story contradicts itself too much and all the "fear" in the series has been taken out. FEAR and its expansions were amazing. It ♥♥♥♥ed with my mind a good bit without using a ton of cheap jump scares. FEAR 2 was okay, there were still some scary parts in it and had a pretty good ending IMO. But FEAR 3... what? The ending is so confusing unless you make up something of your own. And as I said before, not a very scary game.\n\nIf you're just looking for a good FPS game, I'd recommend this even though there are better ones out there. I do not recommend this as a FEAR game though.","May 6","false","5.0"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

The reveal that Alma is pointman's mother in fear 3 seems to cheapen the scares in fear 1 since you now know she is your mother and dosent want to hurt her own son. It also makes no sense that spooky pants cannibal Paxton Fettel would help pointman all of a sudden after being killed by him in Extraction Point. For the first time ever in a fear game you can only carrry two weapons.. In fear 1 you could carry 3 weapons and in fear 2 you could carry 4. Why regress back to two weapons? You miss out on all the fun guns since the ammo for them is so rare they arnt worth picking up. There are no longer any competitive multiplayer modes like deathmatch or capture the flag, however i'll admit the co-op is a lot of fun. F.3.A.R. isn't a bad game, it's just a bad F.E.A.R. game.

Its most unusual feature consists in the fact that there's actually no fear - just anger, and irritation, and tiredness. It's not a thriller anymore - just a shooter. It still bears certain resemblance to Crysis, but I'd say that the latter is more 'paranormal' when compared to this certain game. And the bosses. sure, like in good old times. Damn, I hate bosses, really. (That was a reason why I liked the original FEAR, for instance.)\nWhat's on the positive side of it? Well, that's fine graphics, some new battle enhancements (such as the possibility to take cover behind certain objects and shoot from your hideout - previous FEARs lacked that function), and the gameplay fork that lets you play either with Pointman or with Fettel. And self-restoring health, yes.\nWhat's negative? Simplification, the common disease found in modern games. FEAR and (to some extent) FEAR 2 were more interesting; they were not merely about shooting people, there was room for investigation, for some exploration, and for some mystery. Now that's more trivial: here are some Armacham troops, here are you, you must kill them all and advance further. The same enemies, the same weapons... etc.\nMy verdict - good, but not great.

Shortly it came out that this game is not what i've expected.\n\nFirst of all, developers changed health system to ♥♥♥♥♥♥ one which relies on hiding on covers after you receive damage. Now you can easily hide behind cover after taking many shots unlike it was in previous games.\n\nSecondly in previous games difficulty level was high, now before we finish game it is not possible te set highest level. Tell me why? When you are experienced player you dont want to play game many times.\n\nThirdly, developers included some kind off collectibles - soldiers to sync. Number of collected has influence on score after finishing level, but it doesn't mean any casualties, so why to find all? I don't have any idea.\n\nAnother one new thing in series is level, so when you get higher level you get possibility to have more ammo and last longer in slow-mo. Unfortunately you dont have now to find any hidden items.\n\nTo sump up this part of series sucks, if you liked previous episodes you probably wont like this one. Unfortunately, this is more CoD like game than FEAR. For me 4 out of 10.","December 25, 2014","false","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I enjoy being able to play co-op but since the game was basically built around it both the missions themselves and the player suffers when playing on their own. The saddest part of this is while playing you can see the game had a lot of potential to be better. The ability to play as both people is a great idea and I did enjoy playing the game a second time because when you play as his brother giving the game a whole new experience the 2nd play though. The gameplay itself isn’t creative and just feels like a standard and generic FPS.

I was delighted, but also somewhat disappointed when playing. The atmosphere does well to keep the immersion up, but you won't be ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ your pants and feeling vulnerable, rather the fact you're given so many options now will make you feel over-confident to a point where it supresses the fear part.

It was quite a lot of fun overall even if the scares are definitely getting more than long in the tooth. Alma never does anything so it's only mildly creepy at best when she makes an appearance but never really scary.\n\nSo if we ignore the almost non-existent horror elements and just focus on the shooter mechanics, then we're still left with a competent game in the FPS genre. The gun gameplay is great, the choice of weapons is good and it's just good fun mowing down the soldiers in all sorts of ways, collecting achievements and scores along the way which add a motivating extra reward layer.\nThe AI is quite smart and aggressive at times which makes the game challenging pretty often (Commando difficulty for me). There were a couple parts where I was ready to smash something (especially a certain gate that needed to be open in a late game level where you got swamped with monsters - by the way: not an endless spawn as written in some guides... you can kill them all by hiding behind the trash container where they can't reach you... a few more will spawn once you push the button on the other side but you can easily deal with those few until the gate is down far enough for no more to be able to pass through).\n\nAnyway, my only gripes would be the way the levels are designed. Doors/gates/etc. just close behind you so the levels are very segmented and you can never backtrack for e.g. searching for a missed reward (e.g. Alma doll). On the other hand there is also very little room for exploration which would be another negative. This is a corridor shooter through and through. Thirdly, no quick save is kinda lame and sometimes the checkpoint saves are not spaced/placed ideally.\nAnd finally some of the boss fights (not the final one but the in-between ones) are pretty annoyingly hard.\n\nOverall it is a fun shooter though with a decent plot that motivates you to keep going, even more so if you know the story of F.E.A.R 1 + 2 plus expansions. The shooter mechanics are fun and it's also fun to collect the um... collectibles and achievements. It was NOT fun enough to motivate me to replay as Fettel (I only finished the game as Pointman) but I would definitely recommend anyone to give this game a try, especially now that it should be available for just a few bucks. It's quite a bit better than the Metacritic average would lead you to believe. It would deserve a low-ish 8x average. Thumbs up.\n\n","December 5, 2014","true","13.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The gunplay is solid, but suffers from a lack of enemy type; there's only one supernatural enemy type, and the soldier classes are few and unoriginal. There are a few randomized jump scares that might get you here and there, but overall its not scary; it's built too much like a straight action game. The co-op is only as entertaining as the friend you're playing with, and it only serves to further detract from what little tension there was to begin with.

The actual fear factor and feel of the original games is not really there anymore. Granted some parts were pretty scary but seeing Alma didn't really scare me like it used to. It was more like looking at her in a zoo where she pops up and you get excited to see her as oppose to not wanting to  her to jump scare you or the horrible stuff she does to to alter the reality around you. This game is great as a FPS shooter game though. The action is pretty good and theres no stupid level of difficulty where you get frustrated and dont want to continue. All in all I have to give it a positive rating due to it being a decent shooter, but it doesnt really deserve to be a part of the F.E.A.R. franchise.

While their gameplay wasn't the best, it was still highly entertaining and had just enough horror to keep me shaking in my booties.\n\nFear 3 takes a step into a deep dark part of the gaming world, co-op. For a Horror game, co-op ultimately ruins the tension in the game. Is this true for Fear 3? Ha, there was little horror left in the game other than the obvious jump scares and random moving chairs. Fear 3 is BARELY a horror game. It's more of a creepy looking game with gore and guns.\n\nBut the strange thing is... I like it. I enjoyed running around wrecking my enemies. They never stood a GHOST of a chance! (That there is a Paxton Fettel joke... because he is dead) While I enjoyed the game, playing single player alone just didn't cut it for me. It wasn't worth spending the money on it at that point. However, co-op is where I was sold on this game.\n\nIn co-op one person takes on the mute, bullet dodging hitman called... Point man (yeah screw good names!) and the other takes on the role of the invulnerable ghost of Paxton Fettel. Point man can basically bullet time his way around the place while Paxton, being the what is basically the most powerful psychic person in this universe, can take over bodies at will and have a taste of what it is like being a weak Point Man. Now I know this sounds kind of terrible but playing as Paxton gives you so many options. You can be a great support for Point Man. You can outright blast enemies or take them over as your temporary body. Now staying within the body is not forever and you will have to get another but until then, enjoy the shoot 'em up. While you would think being Point man sucks, it does have it's high points. You easily can get mechs, powersuits and other cool gadgets to take over and run wild in. (Paxton can get them as well by the way but he might bleed out before getting into one)\n\nWorking as a team and dealing with all of the different difficult enemies thrown your way is really crazy fun. I enjoyed the feel of the weapons and how enemies reacted. You blast an enemy with a shotgun and he either gets knocked back or becomes bits. Shooting limbs and heads feel really good in the game, if not very rewarding.\n\nThere is collectables that are actually important as well! You basically get these to increase the time in which you can either be in slow motion or take over a body.\n\nNow the story is forgettable at best as, I only remember the "Brother" jokes I was making as I pointed to my forehead (Again, another Paxton joke). Still, of what story there is, there is some seriously WTH moments in the game. And an ending you will literally fight over.\n\nAs a co-op and a thinly lined multiplayer experience, I can recommend this game as cheap fun. As a single player experience, you really must be wanting to shoot something to come here for it.\n\nCo-op is 8 Paxtons out of 10.\nSingle Player is 6 slowmotion punches out of 10\nMultiplayer is 7 Almas out of 10.\n\nPick it up cheap and you will have no fears.","December 14, 2014","true","29.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Assuming the role of Point Man gets you a fun fast-paced shooter with unalienable slo-mo. But playing as Fettel nets you the ability to possess enemies, and when they expire - they explode in a burst of blood!\n\nThe game's length is on the shorter end of the spectrum, but on the bright side - you can finish the whole thing in co-op mode in a single afternoon. Additionally, the co-op mode is a great boost to the replay value.\n\nThis game as not as creepy-scary as the original, and I started to get skeptical about the amount of scares - until I started interval 4 (the suburbs). This interval alone is worth the money in my opinion; that was the best of classic FEAR!\n\nThe controls are very convenient, enabling the player to assign the same key to mutually-exclusive actions (for the most part). Audio is solid; soundtrack is non-invasive and at times feels very right for the circumstances.\n\nTo sum it up, this game is a fun fast-paced shooter, and can be enjoyed not just by the FEAR veterans, but also the FEAR newbies.","July 3, 2011","true","137.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

If you've played the earlier games you should pick this one up and see the story through since it is not likely there will be more games in the future.\n\n"Day 1 Studios" took over the helm from "Monolith" and "Time Gate Studios" and did an excellent job. The graphics are pretty nice and the controls are more responsive than ever before in any "F.E.A.R."-game.\n\nThe level design was also better than previous games with more varied maps.\n\n+ Nice ending to a good FPS-series.\n+ Fun gameplay.\n+ Slow-Mo (need I say more).\n+ The pointsystem.\n\n- Some of the cutscenes are a bit lenghty.\n- Some enemies have bad Ai.\n- From what I could see, you can not play as Fettel in SP-mode.","August 12, 2014","true","5.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
