The gameplay can be enjoyable on occasion, providing a solid RTS experience, but there is a host of ancillary features that are either broken or missing completely. No attack-moves. No online multiplayer. A short campaign. Annoying multi-level maps. Translation issues. There are just too many little problems in BC Kings that add up to one big headache. The lack of innovation seals the deal: there are way too many other RTS games just like BC Kings to make it stand out. Overall 5/10.","May 16, 2014","true","7.1"," 40 of 55 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","40","55","2","1"

Granted the gameplay at the time was similar to the ‘big two’ being Command and Conquer and Warcraft, it stands out due to its storyline as it ties in playing out our history. Personally, I loved it because you get the play out the Stone Age as no other games done this effectively since. Fast forward to 2008, another RTS game arrived where you can play out the Stone Age (with some twists) and filled the landscape with dinosaurs – and who doesn’t like dinosaurs? This game, BC Kings, whilst kept on the traditional RTS formula (explore / build / conquer), it added some RPG elements and encourages exploration as well. A decent game considering it’s an indie title however I wished there were more dinosaurs to play with.\n\nOverall, the game was a blast to play from start to finish with some twists and turns along the way. Yes it does feel like a rip-off from Age of Empires however it’s obvious that there’s a lot of love and care poured into this game. The UI is nicely designed with beautiful pictures that resembles cavemen paintings splashed throughout is an example of devotion. However I praise the developers for trying out something new to the ever-so overused RTS formula where it encourages you to explore, have multiple maps, a spray of RPG and even has a third person view option (well…one mission has this). Some of these innovations plays well and others not so however that’s not to discredited their efforts. It’s a light hearted RTS that’s very enjoyable to play until the very end. Let’s put it this way, when I think of that title, it places a smile in my face and that’s a good thing.\n\n8 / 10\n\nFull review here:\nhttp://www.gamespot.com/bc-kings/user-reviews/2200-12641425/","March 30, 2015","true","38.6"," 24 of 29 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","24","29","0","0"

Definitely do not buy it for full price, compared to other RTS games that are made today it is not as good but it brings some of that old-school RTS feel with it and is good for gamers that remember the challenging mechanics and playstyles of old RTS games. It has an interesting campaign and a fun variety of units but the graphics are dated and the online is all but dead.

The strategy is not revolutionary in any way, though you do have some interesting elements such as a secondary quest system and a possibility to travel between maps. The biggest drawback is the graphics. Everything would have been much better if the devs had paid more attention to the engine. If, on the other hand, you're into old school strategies, but don't mind the graphics, give BC Kings a go. :)","January 13, 2011","true","1.1"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","15","18","0","0"

Unfortunately in some missions it feels a bit overused, sending you back and forth between maps with no apparent reason other than "it's there, so let's use it"; some of the submaps could have easily been implemented as a single map with some "natural" boundary like a mountain or river and a same-map teleport.\n\nOne of the campaign missions constantly crashes, which needs a substantial amount of patience (and liberal use of autosave) to eventually work through in order to continue the campaign progress.\n\nAdding to the patience requirement is the speed of your units vs the size of the map vs the amount of back-and-forth required for some missions; basically, some of the game's mechanics result in artificially inflated playtime. One mission took me nearly 2 hours, simply because my hero unit had to walk from one end to the other of 3 different submaps, 2 to 4 times per map. While another mission has you waiting out the enemy's attacks--even if you've managed to gate off the spawn points with walls and guard towers--for what felt like an eternity (maybe it was only 20-30 minutes), before finally opening up a quest that lets you block the spawn points permanently. That quest itself then involves an extremely slow unit, which you then have to direct to each of the furthest corners of the map before actually completing the mission.\n\nThere are a considerable number of glaring typos, which appear inconsistently, in various parts of the game. "Got to map" instead of "Go To", "Ho11y Place" instead of "Ho1y", "Train Scuto Rider" instead of "Scout", and others. And for some awful reason, lowercase "L" is represented by the same character graphic as "1"; this can be seen as ear1y as the profi1e se1ect screen that appears before you can do anything e1se... where the defau1t profi1e name is "P1ayer".\n\nThese points aside, it's a pretty interesting theme for an RTS, with a fairly entertaining story; it was engaging enough that I stuck through the campaign to the end. Recommend this game only if it's on sale and only if you are resolved enough to suffer a few crashes.","November 29, 2014","true","20.1"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","9","10","2","0"

Be prepared to restart some stages a few times as it is all too easy to lose a unit that "must" survive to complete a quest.\nBC Kings has some really good design innovation elements, but not all of these are flawlessly implemented.  If you are looking for a more polished product that has some similar gameplay elements - look at Warcraft, Warcraft II, Warcraft III.\nHowever the setting for BC Kings is quite unique and the whole Neanderthal setting with cavemen and dinosaurs has a certain quirky appeal to it.  With a revamp of the artwork and graphics, some voice-overs and a bit of refinement this game would certainly have more appeal and value.\nOverall as it stands you get a game that is fun to play, but it is very much a diamond in the rough.","March 27, 2014","true","8.4"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","11","16","0","0"
