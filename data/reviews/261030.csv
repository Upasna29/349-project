"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kenuty/recommended/261030/","kenuty","Kenuty","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kenuty/","1340 products in account","SPOILER FREE REVIEW~\nIf you are a fans of the original  game, this is season 2 of an ongoing popular series based on a comic and tv show. the main character this time is Clementine, the little girl who must survive in this post apocalyptic world filled the undead and lost hopes will discover that the people she meets and the choices she makes can be much more dangerous.\n\nThe game starts off showing off  your previous gameplay choices from season 1. Also it carries over your save from 400 days which doesn't do much but be ready to load them anyways! The game  starts off suspenseful, sometimes slows down to give the player a grasp on whats going on and picks right back up on the action. At the same time,  the story adapts to the choices the player makes while still following a main plotline itself. If you enjoyed the original series then you will enjoy this one much more, The new way the ui interface guides you is much more nicely done in terms of  being smoother  and cannot be any  easier to understand. As you watch the episodes play on you'll see that the game slowly advances itself with much more interactivity and choices.\n\nThe gameplay is quite simple to play and  has much more than just qtes (quick time events). Aside from pressing and smashing  certain key buttons during sequence there will be time when players willl have to control Cleminetine to interact with the game's environment itself along with various actions such as sneaking, shooting,  or interacting with other characters in the game in regards to the situation. As the episode is played the player will have to make choices in dialogues that will be shown on the screen, There will be a limited time to do so before it is default randomly picked to keep the story flowing.\n\nAside from the amazing voice acting, well written dialogue, beautifully drawn cell shaded art and immersive story line. The game includes choices to make the player feel every emotion humanly possible . Depending on the choices that'll be made, Cleminetine will either seem like a cold hearted human being or one that will tolerate and love for everyone. The decision is yours to make. Although there are times in this game  there will be limited choices to make due to the main plotline, it will shake the very foundation of her conscience and yours.\n\n\n\n[WARNING] - If you suck at QTE etc this game will take you a long time to conquer\nYou will see death scenes, many many death scenes which can be quite gruesome so try to stay alive.\n\n[WARNING] If you have a faint heart, be ready because some of the scenes in this game is not for the squeemish. There will be many things you do not want to see in this game but it brings out the immersion to it and emotions.\n\n\nEnjoy the game Cool hats off to you and Game ON!\n\n\n+ Cell shaded beautiful artwork\n+ Immersive storyline\n+ Leaves you on the edge with suspense\n+ Experience fear, joy, dispair, anger, love, and the feels\n+ The art is fantastic and well drawn.\n+ The voice acting is superb and top quality\n+ Adaptable story choices that will keep you playing and wanting more.\n\n+ - its a graphic novel game with Qte, you will either like it or don't like it\n\n- Its a graphic novel game, not everyones type of game but it is one of the best ones out there.\n- You'll have to replay the game to see different choices, though it doesn't really change out the main storyline direction itself but it will affect many events\n- If you haven't played part one of the walking dead or seen the show, you will not understand certain events that is going, just jumping into it is ok but you will miss out on the backstory.\n- Waiting for the episodes, if you are impatient lol.\n\n\nwritten and Played on\ntwitch/kenuty - Finished on 8/26/2014\nYt- Will try to do a video review without spoiler sometimes\n\nAll comments and feedback are appreciated, stop by and say hi when I am live, keep the bottom spoiler free and subscribe to the tube if you want and check out my other reviews on steam.","December 17, 2013","true","11.7"," 1,705 of 1,947 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","705","1","0","51"

The story, setting, and, most importantly, the characters all pulled me into this world where no one is truly safe, and your decisions matter and go beyond the "choice 1 = good-but-risky, choice 2 = evil-but-conserative" trope. So when Season 2 was announced, I was eager to get my hands on it. Now, ten months have passed and the season is over, ending with "Episode 5: No Going Back". Was it amazing, and how did it stack against Season 1?\n\n\nFirst off is the actual game(i.e. graphics, gameplay, etc.) The graphics maintain the same visual style as Season 1, but look a lot better, and a little less rough around the edges. There is occasional pop-in when the game just loaded, but this normally isn't the case as long as you don't fail any of the gameplay. Speaking of which, the gameplay has changed for the better, especially action sequences. As much as I loved Season 1, I will say  that the action parts could've been better. In Season 2, though, they are just plain grand, and Episode 2 has prehaps the best action sequence across both seasons. Also, unlike the majority of Season 1, Season 2 has a full soundtrack that plays the right music at the right time, fitting the mood and tone. No matter the gameplay advances, though: if you're playing this game, it's for the story.\n\n\n(Note: I will try to be as spoiler-free as I can; however, if there is one, don't say I didn't warn you.) The season opens up with a bang, reminding you in the first five minutes that this isn't some cheery game where everyone is happy: this is the Walking Dead, and people- notably the ones you love- are going to die. Events transpire and leave an 11-year old Clementine alone and starving, and when she meets a new group, can she trust them? As the plot carries on, new (and old) characters are introduced, and you eventually have to decide which is better: appealing to your pathos(emotions) or your logos(logic), and this choice not only sets up Clementine for her future, but also kind of defines you as a person to an extent. This season sees you playing as Clem, and whoever came up with this idea is an absolute genious. Clementine is just a little girl, and while at moments she may seem empowering, she is still just a kid and can't influence everything to go her way. However, as those who've played Season 1 know, Lee did not leave Clem helpless. She can survive, and does so often to the point where a specific, boating character comments that "[Clementine] survive[s] better than any three adults put together". As a kid, your power in combat won't be as direct, as she is considerably weaker (physically) than most of the walkers and other survivors. Instead, she uses dexterity and her environment to win. And of couse, this being The Walking Dead, dialouge and character-connecting is the focus here. As only one character from Season 1 re-appears, most of the people you're talking with are people you only met recently, and how you interact with them could affect their trust in you.\n\n\nWhen the characters die in this season, none of them are quite like saying goodbye in Season 1, but its not supposed to: you've only knew this people for a week or two, so you're not going to get bonded with them as much as you did with Lee and Clem last season. Nonetheless, you will find yourself liking some characters over others. Instead of trying to decimate your heart, Season 2 more leaves an uneasy, queasy felling at the end of each episode, almost like "Did I make the right choice? Is there something I could've done differently?", and it's hard to shake off this feeling. So, think of it like this: Season 1 was heart-breaking, and Season 2 is gut-wrentching survival.\n\n\nThere are a total of five different endings for Season 2, and they all define who your Clementine is and who she will become. While none of the endings are exactly happy, one left me actually feeling heart-warmed, one left me bitter-sweet, another left me worried for the future, and the last two were not-so-good as the other two good ones (for those of you who know, the two not-so-good ones are both of Jane's endings).However, I felt that the game had done a very good job creating a tale of growing up. Most of the decisions that Clem has to make are the same type (albiet without the whole zombie and survival part) that we ourselves make as kids that determine who we are. Tell Tale Games has recently confirmed Season 3's existence. If Season 1 was finding and teaching Clem, and Season 2 was molding and shaping her, I think it's safe to say that Season 3 will be seeing that shape and how it effects her views and opinions, which should be enticing for any fan. So, is Season 2 better than Seaon 1? In the end, yes, most definatly yes.I hope that I can continue to be there for Clementine as she goes through this jam, and I can't wait to see what directions it takes her in...","October 24, 2014","true","26.6"," 218 of 248 people (88%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","88","218","248","11","13"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nomedemon/recommended/261030/","nomedemon","[AReV]Nomed","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nomedemon/","1050 products in account","Season two marks the next chapter in Telltale’s The Walking Dead.\n\nThe Walking Dead emphasizes narrative and character development over all else. If you’re looking for solid gameplay, you may be disappointed in that regard. On the other hand though, TWD excels at providing an engaging story and features extremely likable characters. It plays out in the form of a point and click adventure game which feels a lot like an interactive movie. There are no puzzles, and the gameplay is handled through quick time events most of the time.\n\nSeason two continues shortly after where the first left off and this time you’ll be playing as Clementine opposed to Lee. Seeing the world through the eyes of a little girl immediately makes the game feel more depressing and hopeless as she has to fend for herself now. The zombies, which felt fairly weak in season one are suddenly a much more dangerous threat for Clementine to deal with as well.\n\nThe story telling is second to none; however my main issue with The Walking Dead is the whole illusion of choice aspect. At the time of this review, only the first episode of season two is available but this problem was quite prevalent in season one. At first glance, the game will make you feel as if your choices have a major influence on the story. Upon further investigation, you’ll realize that regardless of your choices, you’ll always be brought to the same conclusion. This makes The Walking Dead an extremely enjoyable experience the first time you play but it essentially eliminates any element of re-playability afterwards.\n\nIf you’re looking for a great story, definitely check it out; just don’t expect to influence it much.\n\nFor a more detailed review of Season Two, here’s a review video I made for episode One:\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=210486846\n\n\nIf you enjoyed this review, feel free to follow me as a Steam Curator: http://store.steampowered.com/curator/4886473/","January 5, 2014","true","18.9"," 171 of 193 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","171","193","0","6"

It is not necessary, but recommended.\n\nIt has the same gameplay as part 1 and plays similar, but sadly you have even less gameplay involved.

There were some minor interface changes that improved the experience and felt very good once getting used to them.  Also Season 2 did appear to make it a point to get right into the action with a little less focus on the down time.  The tone of the game remained very much like that of Season 1.  Even though you are playing as the 11 year old Clementine, Telltale did not hold any punches in the story and many of the situations that you are placed in can be very unsettling.  I could definitely see the difference in the character, and how she has grown as a survivor, with all of the innocence of a normal child her age long gone.  Just like in Season 1 you just don't know whether the living or the dead are the bigger threat to you, and there are a couple of really heartbreaking moments right out of the gate.\n\nDecisions from Season 1 and the 400 Days DLC are imported if you choose and the events of Season 2 will be altered based on those prior choices.  While Season 2 can be started without playing the prior season, I highly recommend doing Season 1 first so that you have a better understanding of what is happening and to have your choices imported rather than being randomly selected for you.\n\nAnd like Season 1, if you are an achievement hunter, it seems that the achievements will come simply by playing through the game, so it is very easy to get 100%.\n\nThe music sets the mood for the game appropriately.  And dang, that song "In the Water" that is played during the end credits...\n\nAnxiously looking forward to the upcoming episodes for this season.\n\n","December 29, 2013","true","8.8"," 93 of 111 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","93","111","0","8"

The gameplay is definitely better with better quick time events and oh boy, there are some very tough decisions to make in this game as well, starting from the very first episode. But in the entire game, my attachment towards most people was not as high as compared to Walking Dead: Season 1. Yes, characters died and it made me feel bad, sometimes terrible but I didn't feel that rage or that rush of emotions or that melancholy that I did in the first part.\n\nAll in all, this game was pretty great in almost everything but just didn't match up to it's first part but this does not mean you shouldn't play it, it's still a great game.","October 6, 2014","true","20.8"," 79 of 91 people (87%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","87","79","91","7","1"

Episodes of second season are somewhat shorter, for example in first season episodes were somewhere between 120-150 minutes long, these in season 2 are 70-90 minutes long, it's not really big of a deal but I expected them to be even longer. While this is second season it's not really better than the first one at all, yes episodes of second season are more packed with action and all that stuff, but nothing really that I found more ejnoying than the first one. If you finished first season definitely pick this one up too, you won't regret.\n\n\nBADI found characters in the second season little bit boring, everything else is just fine and excellent.","May 8, 2015","true","10.2"," 75 of 86 people (87%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","87","75","86","7","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/meckus/recommended/261030/","meckus","Meckus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/meckus/","373 products in account","Once again, I've decided to review a game that can easily be considered "old" by now. And once again, that has happened because I really enjoyed the game, and I'm hoping that some day, somewhere, someone will be on the fence, not knowing whether they should buy this game or not, and my review will help them make that decision. I really enjoyed the game, just as I enjoyed season 1, and even if you're not a fan of the series, of even the comic books, you'll certainly love the game if you're a video games fan.\n\nWithout any further delay, I present to you my review of The Walking Dead, season 2.\n\nGameplayI'll be making a considerable ammount of comparisons to season 1, as I'm expecting people to have played that one before considering season 2.\nAs expected, season 2 picks off a little while after season 1 ends, and if you did, in fact, play season 1, you'll be able to use that save so that the game adapts to the choices you made in the past.\nThis time Clementine won't have Lee around, which she will sorely miss, and so will we, but that's ok, because she's a nice girl, and Lee taught her everything she needed to know in order to survive.\nFrom the get-go the story is more focused on the human side of what's left, and not just run/hide/kill zombies. Obviously, there will still be zombies to kill, and zombies to hide or run from, but it won't feel as important. You'll have to make choices, some harder than others, and they will tailor the game as you go along, or this wouldn't be a Telltale game.\nYou can expect the same graphics you had one season 1, with some tweaks to the graphical hiccups you might have felt while playing the previous season.\nYou can also expect an incredible soundtrack, which adapts effortlessly to the scenario at hand.\n\nPros Probably the most important thing is that if you played Season 1, and even the DLC (400 days), you'll be able to use that save so the story gets tailored with the choices you made before, and not just some random events;\nThe story turns out to be more violent, with more human interactions to it, making it a great sequel to season 1;\nGreat graphics;\nManaged to maintain the standards of season 1 sountrack;\nAmazing voice acting, as season 1 had, despite not having Lee's soothing voice around anymore;\nGreat improvement on the menu sounds over season 1 (this is a +++ for me).\nCons Might take some time getting used to the "new" UI and functions if you played season 1;\nDespite having a great story, sometimes it feels all the paths lead to the same place.\nVerdictI'd give it a 9/10 as I just don't feel it's as fluid as season 1, and the life/death situations aren't as exhilarating.\n\n\nP.S. I also shed some tears in the end of season 2, too. I miss Lee.","April 4, 2015","true","10.3"," 58 of 67 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","58","67","0","7"

Some episodes felt like they were taking forever to finish but overall it was not that bad.\nGraphics 5/5 - Graphics for this game were slightly better than the last game but mainly stayed on the same level. I haven’t played as many games as other gamers have but I though the graphics for both games were amazing, I give props to the designers.\nStory line 6/5- Amazing storyline, just as good as the last one but I felt that this one went more into depth with certain characters. More of the characters had back story which really makes this game a must play. Compared to the first game it has more suspense and what I felt was an overall better story progression in where they tried to tell what happened to every character.\nHorror2/5- Some jump scares but they are very slight, it’s not really a horror game like Outlast. I am a fan of Horror and love blood and gore, and while there was some blood and gore I felt like there could have been more.\nAction 4.5/5 -While this is not like a typical action (being where you are doing the moves yourself) game I found that it had its moments, most of the actions came from the decisions you made both verbally and physically. The more decisions you make the more action you tend to receive depending on the story.\nSuspense 5/5- Very suspenseful, makes you question what is going to happen next just like in the first installment. Playing the game while the stores were still being release made me mad because I wanted to find out what happened next. It was frustrating because when I was on the edge of my seat the on the next episode of the game would pop up. To make things my frustrating there is news of a Walking Dead Season 3 game said to be released in December so the means more waiting for us.\n\n\n\nIf you are a fan of the Walking Dead video game then I recommend the second installment of the series, I have played both and personally I believe season 2 is something that can definitely compete with season 1. I have spent up to forty five hours playing both games and have gotten all of the achievements for both of the games, and it was worth every second that I played.\nIf you remember in the first walking dead you played as Lee, a father like figure who is constantly watching out for Clementine, a small girl whose parents left her at home when they went on vacation. As the story progressed you grow attached to the characters especially Lee and Clementine but depending on which root you choose you are left seeing Clementine surviving on her own. In this season you play as Clementine as she survives through new dangers and experiences while she grows up in this apocalyptic society.  She is constantly outsmarting the adults around her, which in my opinion shows that she adapted well to the society and that Lees death wasn’t in vain. In each danger or crisis you once again have to make decisions that will not only affect Clementine but the other characters around her. Overall it was an amazing game for both the first and second seasons and I recommend this game to all of my family and friends. Here were some things that I thought the gamer could expect when playing the Season 2 of the Walking Dead game:\n\nWhat to expect\n-	Blood and gore, while not as bad as the game Outlast there is still slight blood and gore\n-	A child constantly outsmarting the adults that she is around\n-	New characters will great back stories that make us question the decisions that we make\n-	Zombies, as the mentions this is the Walking Dead so zombies are a given\n-	Tears , keep a box of tissues handy people trust me it can be sad at times\n\nWhat not to expect\n-	Do not expect it to be like the TV series, they are two separate matters and have completely different characters. Sorry but there will be no Daryl Dixon, or Rick Grimes in this game.\n-	Butterflies and sunshine, it’s a Zombie apocalypse the only way you get that is if you die.\n-	A season three anytime soon, the earliest they stated its going to be released is by December 2015 and knowing them it will probably be longer than that.\n-	Lee coming back riding on a horse like a knight to save clementine.\n-	MMO and competitive game play, this is not like CSGO or COD, if you are looking for this , it’s not your game\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat type of computer it takes to run:\nhttp://www.systemrequirementslab.com/cyri\nI recommend this cite if you are not sure how your computer runs to see if your computer can handle running the game. It is a trusted cite that I myself have used many times on my old computers to make sure they could run the game.\n","April 24, 2015","true","13.3"," 48 of 61 people (79%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","79","48","61","9","16"

That's where the game falls short, for me.\n\nWithout divulging spoilers I'll simply point out a few things.\n\n- The adults in this game are shallow, vapid and near-idiotic humans who seem unable to make even the most minor decision without consulting an 8 year old girl. That this was done as a means of getting you, the character, involved seems obvious.  But the writers forego any attempt at logic or reason in the method they chose to get you involved.  The group doesn't know whether to trust person X.  "Clem, what do you think?"  The group isn't sure where to go to avoid the next traumatic event or to deal with a current situation. "What should we do, Clem?"  In this sense the adults nearly all only exist as a means to an end, the end being making you feel as if the things you say and do matter.  They don't. Most people familiar with the first game know they don't matter. Keeping up the pretense at this point comes at the expense of actually having to make these characters think and act like... people.\n\n- Likewise there's inconsistency in their behavior. For the most part you, Clem, will be the voice of reason, the arbiter of justice, the pacifier of aggression, etc.  Until the game feels it's time to remind you that you're just a little girl, again. At that point the rest of it goes out the window and the adults are suddenly knowledgeable and efficient and wise and you're just a wee little lass who's lost and alone and probably needs a hug, yeah?   Okay. Humans are inconsistent, self-contradictory, forgetful, all of those things. The trouble is the writers didn't bother to put any sort of justification in to explain this idea or expound on it, with one or two exceptions.  There are a couple of decent characters here whose inconsistency and reluctance to make hard decisions is directly tied to their past experience. The rest not so much, if at all.\n\n- The dialogue choices I was given often left me wondering whether the people writing them in one scene were at all aware of the things written in other scenes.  You're presented with a choice at one point, say, and then later that situation is referenced, but you're given no option at all to remind anyone of the previous conversation or interaction or meeting or whatever it was.  It completely pulls you out of any immersion in the story, and leaves you feeling as if you could just as easly have clicked things at random as they popped up.  Again, this isn't about making a difference in the overall plot or the fate of any particular person. It's about consistency, and it misses the mark in a big way for me.\n\nIn short, at full price the game doesn't even stack up to the first Season, much less improve.  If you can get it on sale at half price... yeah, sure, as long as you don't expect too much from it in the way of a compelling cast of characters that you'll get invested in, or consistency in their behavior and atittudes.   Otherwise, save your money for something else.","July 24, 2014","false","9.5"," 233 of 378 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","233","378","0","20"

Thank you telltale for this amazing game. It was less emotional for me but still very good.\nThe second season is more gloomy, people are dying on every step and you must make some tough choices. There's that feeling that there's no hope, you feel this on every step. When you feel like there's a small chance that everything will be alright, something bad happens and it repeats again and again until you understand that there's no hope. Nice to see how Clementine matured, the life was harsh to her. You remember how defenseless and vulnerable she was in the first season and now she's much tougher, has seen much more pain and can defend herself and look after herself.\nThe game is almost identical to the previous one. Same graphics, same controls, same everything except for the characters and story of course which are main aspects making this game awesome.\nThere's nothing to say more about this great game.

You play as Clementine, the only competant person on planet earth. She's ten, by the way, what does that say about you guys? I mean, I live in a box, you guys don't have an excuse. After the events of season 1, Clementine is on her own after losing the remainder of her original group. Now on her own, Clementine must face the cruel realities of a world that no longer cares for her, or has animal crackers.\n\nThat's only for maybe the first 30 minutes, actually. Soon, Clementine finds herself in a group you may or may not like. Because this is Walking Dead, and there are more douches than the product aisle at Zellers. Thanks AMC. I can't go much more into the plot without having to spoil things for people, for example when they find out that Clementine is the last Airbender. that really caught me off guard.\n\nThe game follows the typical Telltale format, it's an adventure game where you spend more time talking to people you don't like then spending time hitting zambonies with hammers. This isn't really a bad thing, since the dialogue and back stories of all the miserable ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s you have to hang out with is actually interesting to listen to. But this being a video game with a main protagonist, a lot of the plot centers around Clemmy herself.\n\nThis sometimes doesn't translate well, when a group of fully grown adults expects insermountable things from a ten year old girl, who doesn't really have much competition outside of the fifteen year old girl who may or may not have autism. It's never really explained. I'm going to be perfectly honest, Clementine probably deserves better than this. If you gave her four boards and a hammer, she would probably have a wood lodge with a fire place and a playstation built before sun down. This still doesn't change the fact that the adults around her are completely unreasonable.\n\nI've been told that it is a very emotional story, but I didn't personally find myself crying or feeling depressed over the events that transpire. This may be because it just didn't hit me at the right level, it felt forced, or I was just cooking a pot of baked beans when sad things happened. Who knows.\n\nShould you play Walking Dead: season 2?\n\nIt's one of those games people really like to talk about. Though it's not for everyone, you can always get it while it's on sale. And you can be like all the cool kids with their bop its and their Pokemon cards and their Street Shark Action figures. Why couldn't I be like them, MOM!?\n\n15/7, how come Krillin didn't have a nose?","November 8, 2014","true","9.8"," 33 of 41 people (80%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","80","33","41","18","2"

This time around, you play as Clementine, who is no longer the scared little girl from Season 1. Without spoiling anything important, the plot centers around a new group of survivors Clementine encounters, and the challenges they face.\n\nGameplay is exactly the same as the previous game. You mostly choose between various dialogue options, with occasional breaks for action sequences (click the mouse on Walkers to kill them, mash the "Q" key really fast, etc). There's not much in the way of "game" here - it is simply an interactive story. As with the first season, the voice acting is top notch, and the visuals work very well for the game style. I have no complaints at all about any of the technical aspects of the game. On a side note, if you import your save files from Season 1 and/or the 400 Days DLC, the choices you made in those stories will be reflected in Season 2. This is a nice touch. Unfortunately, in the case of 400 Days, the results are mostly inconsequential, which felt like a letdown.\n\nWhat makes Season 2 different is the new cast of characters. Unfortunately, that's also the game's biggest issue. For whatever reason, I just never felt a big connection to anyone in this game, except Clementine (and one other person, which I won’t spoil for plot reasons). I can’t really place my finger on why this is. Maybe it's a combination of the novelty of the first game having worn off, and pretty much knowing exactly what to expect out of the Walking Dead universe by now. I'm not sure. None of this is to say the characters or the plot are outright bad by any stretch. That's not the case at all. I just didn’t feel as involved in or as attached to any of the characters as I did in the previous game.\n\nThat said, there are some genuinely good moments across the 5 episodes, and plenty of those patented Tough Choices (tm.) that have become the hallmark of the series. The highlight is Clementine, who ends up being a great protagonist. It's great to continue her story and see her progression from child to adult under unthinkable circumstances. Overall, I enjoyed the game, and it’s well worth playing for anyone who enjoyed Season 1. I always felt the legacy of the first game would be hard to live up to, and that proved to be true - just go into Season 2 with lowered expectations and you probably won’t be disappointed.","August 30, 2014","true","9.1"," 27 of 33 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","27","33","0","1"

Each episode builds upon the last, and we open with the slightly older and more experienced Clementine being once again ripped from the last vestige of Season One’s survivors. These initial scenes, when Clementine is truly at her most vulnerable, allow new characters and personalities to fill the void, and they are definitely a step up from those that we have love and lost before.\n\nI would actually state that new characters such as Luke, Rebecca and the reprehensible Carver create a far bigger impression and provide a longer lasting memory. The performances by the voice actors is incredibly top notch, and the screams from Sarita during a particularly grisly moment are some of the best acting this medium can produce. By the end of Season Two Clementine and the other survivors will have experienced levity, horror, fear, love, friendship, anger and many other emotions beside, with a strong cast that have truly become their characters.\n\nBut among it all, there is Clementine. By the end of Season One you loved this little girl, and you wanted to protect her from the horror that has become of the world. Put into the spotlight herself, she thrives as a character in and of herself. Through the course of Season Two we see her grow, mature and even command the respect of those much older. She is strong-willed and can even have a lick of malice, depending on your actions. It’s a thrill to see her change and be changed because of the actions of others, and she can be both the voice of reason and the voice of spite.\n\nAs with Season One, the dialogue is the main gameplay element that will take up the most of your time. While engaged with the other characters there are usually four options and a timer to quickly speak. Staying silent is also an option, and what you say, how you say it, and if you choose to speak at all can place other character’s lives in your hands. You cannot mull over your responses, weighing the pros and cons over your eventual choice – the game’s dialogue is fast-paced and demanding, and can have an intensity that other games couldn’t even begin to touch. This dynamic is as much a source of tension as the ever-present zombies, and these choices do affect how some situations play out.\n\nHowever, beyond dialogue, there remains a noticeable lack of direct interaction in The Walking Dead Season Two. Opportunities to explore the varied settings are far and few between, and these settings are much smaller than they appear at first glance. It’s hard to feel engrossed in the environment when you spend the vast amount of your gameplay ignoring it and talking to the next character to advance the plot. Quick-time events do vary the action on occasion, but the pacing of the gameplay is rather ho-hum.\n\nDespite these concerns, Season Two is still a strong enough experience to merit your time. Clementine’s story is enough to carry the game through any interactive short-comings. The quality of the experience is measured through how torn you feel when a beloved character is inevitably killed. While Season Two doesn’t have the impact that Season One has made – it is another strong showing from the great storytellers at Telltale and comes highly recommended for anyone who enjoyed Season One.\n\n8.0/10\n","June 26, 2015","true","26.2"," 19 of 21 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","19","21","0","2"

This led me to laugh hard at the start of the game from the unintentional humour that came up by playing as an 11 year old girl. There is a part where you have to choose between saving two people being attacked by zombies, one of them is already bitten so if you leave him to be munched on by 4 zombies his friend says to you “why didn’t you save him!”……. I mean dude…….she didn’t even have a weapon!\n\nClementine’s dialogue response options should be…\n\nA)	Are you f*cking kidding me?\nB)	I’m an 11 year old little girl you absolute muppet!\nC)	If you could aim and didn’t jam your gun like a dumb*ss maaaaaaybe he would have survived, you incompetent redneck hillbilly drunkard!\nD)	…\n\nBefore you comment and tell me you can save the other guy, I know you can right, but it’s still absurd to shout at a little girl that she should have attempted to fight off 4 zombies at once to save a guy already bitten that she barely knew.\n\nThere were some other parts where the other characters seemed forced by the writers to speak to you in a certain way, or ask your advice on adult situations, or even tell you things that no adult would talk to or tell a child in real life. I see that as laziness on the writers part, they could have gotten round that if they had Clem eavesdrop instead, but I guess that would have made it too stealth orientated for them.\n\nThis is gonna be subjective, but I also found most of the characters you meet either unlikable (Bonnie, Nick, Rebecca, Carlos) or generic (Luke, Alvin, Mike) to really care about. I just wanted most of them to be killed. The first season’s characters had about half I actually liked and got me invested in their survival. I think they dropped the ball here, you could argue it’s further into the zombie apocalypse so the people would be more irritable and c*ntish but still, it really p*ssed me off how nearly everyone treated Clementine like sh*t. In the first season they were all looking out for the kids.\n\nIt’s still pretty good overall though in terms of pacing and story, but I did figure out what certain characters where doing before I think you were meant to, which in turn made me choose a different response for Clem than I maybe would have had they been able to really pull the wool over my eyes.","May 3","true","8.6"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","15","16","2","0"

You are faced to make choices no girl should have to and this leads to a lot of problems either way.\n\nThe games sounds, characters (and returning characters) and music were absolutely amazing yet again. This season had some very tense, frustrating and saddening moments which all helped this game become one of my all time favourites.\n\nIf you haven't played the first season, I highly recommend you do.\n\n10/10 for feelerinos, and expert crafting.","September 15, 2014","true","8.4"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","14","15","0","0"

It took me around 9 hours to finish all the episodes and there was times I wish they could last longer but in the end it was a nice journey. Choices in this game will matter, however not all of them and they may not lead to the impact you may expect. You'll be facing reactions from others in which they will remember what you did, to whom you stood up to or what you have chosen in a moment where there was not time to reflect properly. While the big decisions can impact the story I wish they would make more decisions and create a bigger impact around every character instead of a comment every now and then. Clementine is really young, but she became very aware of how harsh the world can be. Sometimes, innocence will make her believe in people she shouldn't or spare someone when it might not have been the best decision.\n\nHowever, I felt they put too much pressure for a little girl. Too often you will have others asking what you (Clementine) think about some themes, what should they should do or forcing her to choose a side, a path, who lives, who dies. I find hard to feel immersed in these parts because in a world where everyone is fighting for food, ammo and their very own survival it does not seem realistic to put so much weight and the destiny itself in the hands of a young girl. I understand that this is you, the player, who is making the choices but during Season one it was much more easier because you were Lee and I did everything to protect my sweet pea. Now that you play as her I can't help but feel that others rely too much on a opinion from a young girl and it seems... unreal. Unfair too.\n\nThe soundtrack is nicely done. The main theme is a mix of hope and despair and get you in the mood really quickly. Most of the story elements will be more or less intense depending on how you play. As some of you may know, you can't expect much gameplay wise since it's a Story driven game so it's important for you to relax, be Clem and let yourself be part of this world filled with death and little hope. The more you let yourself get lost in the world the better your experience will be.\n\nIt is not a game for everyone, that is for sure but if you like to listen to a story while making some decisions that could change the destiny of some people, I say, give it a try. Looking back, the first Season made a bigger impact on me. First I had to protect someone more than everything and Lee was an amazing character with a great voice and warm morals to keep his sweet pea safe from everyone, walkers or not. There was more Point & Click aspects when comparing to the Season Two, in fact I don't recall a moment where I have to stop and think about solving something, which can be a shame if you enjoy a little puzzling in your point & click games (as it should be!).\n\nFinally, I found no issues while playing this game aside of two achievements not unlocking at the start of the 5th episode. I unlocked them by replaying those parts. In the end, I had great fun with this game and I hope others can experience the way I did.\n\nMy only advice would be: Do not trust anyone.","August 28, 2014","true","8.9"," 17 of 21 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","17","21","0","1"

The Walking Dead: Season 2 is not an exception.\n\nWhen I played the first episode, I thought to myself, that Telltale Games will not pull off something like the original game and I was right at first. The first episode and maybe, half of the second didn't make me attached to the characters. As the game progresses, you start caring about several characters, about the events going on without even noticing. If you are left with a choice where you have to pick a side or do something, you will wish you had that extra 10 seconds to think about it, while at the start of the game it didn't feel as important. You will feel even more attached and invested in the story after each episode, so don't jump in conclusions right when you start playing it. Trust me, I didn't want to play like a little girl at first either.\n\nI recommend TWD:S2 not because it is a good game, but because it is one of the few games that actually makes you feel something inside, makes you think about morals. Pretty much shows the human side of you. While on games like Postal, Manhunt, Killing Floor etc. you'll feel anger and no remorse. Some games make you absolutely neutral. It's safe to say that both The Walking Dead games are worth your time and the full price.\n\n","March 16, 2015","true","17.1"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","14","16","0","0"

Ok, firstly, I'm going to say it straight up, TWDS2 did live up to my expectations. I'm not sure why, but a lot of people thought that Season 2 was going to be better than Season 1. Now I'll agree that this was a great game and I loved every second of it, but it wasn't better than Season 1. I personally don't think Telltale will ever create something as magnificent as Season 1 Of The Walking Dead. Now that we've cleared that up, onto what I thought about the game. I'm a huge fan of The Walking Dead, especially the games (I haven't seen the TV series, but apparently it's nothing spectacular) and this was a treat for me. I enjoyed what they did with the interface of the game, and I felt like the game in general, along with the soundtrack, was clean and on par with what I was expecting. Now the story is where this game both excels and falls. Telltale's Walking Dead series is known for it's story and characters, and I felt like they didn't forget that most of the time. But some events in the game just make me question their thought processes when designing them. Most of the characters were well-developed, however there were some who seemed to be introduced into the game, and killed out in the following 2-3 chapters. Back when I played Season 1, I didn't understand why this was the case, but now I'm enlightened about the subject, and surprisingly, it makes for a richer experience whilst playing. Overall, no matter what Telltale does with this series, I don't think I could ever hate this series. I was going to give it an 8 at most, but for nostalgic/personal reasons, I am giving it a 10/10 rating.","September 14, 2014","true","9.1"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","0"

Now, the focus is set on an older Clementine, as more or less 2 years passed since TWD: Season 1. It means mainly that as she's still a kid, while there is still action, the game is more about survival, stealth and less about saving people or sparing (or not) lives, even if Clementine will be confronted to some though choices that may be a life or a death sentence.\n\nThe game is like the first one: you're looking around, you're taking items with you and you talk a lot. Your choices will impact the game, though everything done before will have a minimal impact in the fifth episode. So, yeah, if you're expecting different endings, there are only 3 major endings and in two of them, you have a decision to make that will result in two sub-endings. You'll tell me that it was the same case in the first game, but your relationship with everyone had an impact in the beginning of the fifth episode. Here, there is none apart from an episode to another (a character that lives will appear if he wasn't killed before for example). Even if you choose one action on another and decide to rewind the chapter and do the contrary, you'll end up with the same reaction, which means that some choices aren't really impacting the game.\n\nHere's the brief story of each episode. I'm trying not to spoil you on it, though, as the game is relying also on your emotions.\n\nAfter the events in the first season, Clementine is now travelling with Christa. However, some bandits separate them and Clementine finds herself alone in a forest. She meets a group but what will happen?\n\nIn the second episode, Clementine is now integrated with the group, though they lost a member. However, the visit of their enemy Carver will make them leave the cabin. Now being pursued by Carver, will they find some help? And what will be in store with Clementine? Will she find a friend that she thought was lost a long time ago?\n\nIn the third episode, the group is captured by Carver and comes back to the shelter they left months ago though. How will they manage to escape? Who is willing to help them? Why Carver is interested in Clementine?\n\nIn the fourth episode, the escape didn't go as smoothly as they thought. But Rebecca is ready to have her kid, some members are still missing and you need items to prepare the birth. And one of your friends really needs to get out of his grief...\n\nIn the fifth episode, after the encounter with the Russians prompted by the lies of one of their members, the group is trying to find a shelter in the winter, with a baby. Your long-time friend is showing more and more his bad side. What will happen to Clementine?\n\nThe story is well-written and relying on the feelings you may experience. The fact that now, you're the little girl is also playing a great part of it. You want her to be safe and generally, you're driven by the fact that as she's still a kid, you need her to be a little naive or innocent. However, the options in the game allow you to make a character that has seen so much in life that she can be hard and react as an adult. But Clementine can also be by herself and way more mature than some adults in the game. Even when afraid, she's not giving up (besides, if you want to advance in the story, you don't have a choice in the matter).\n\nThe graphiscs didn't change from the first game, it's still in a cell-shading look. However, the season isn't the same: we're at the end of fall, beginning of the winter. TWD was more set during late spring/summer and was ending at fall. However, this factor isn't really important per se but it's nice to see different landscapes, some with snows. Besides, as usual, the game is making you move around, though the episodes isn't set in a town or around it, here, you're really in the forest, more in the wild than TWD.\n\nThe soundtrack is as usual good and fitting to the ambiance, after all, you're in a post-apocalyptic world if I may say. And you're confronted to an harsh reality.\n\nAnyway, in the end, TWD: Season 2 didn't really bring something new apart the change of protagonist, going with the change of the "scope". But if you like TWD, you'll like this game too. If you like TTG's way, you'll like this one too. If I recommend the game? Sure, I bought the season from episode 1 and suffered the patience to wait for each episode. And it was a joy when the game was updated. But at least, TWD: Season 2 is putting you in the shoes of a kid in TWD's universe and only for that, you need it. Besides, as usual, with choices to make, you can replay a lot the game after to make the story that will be the much better for you, though myself, I tend to stick to my personality and I don't want to make a Clementine that isn't caring a little.","February 16","true","21.7"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","11","12","0","0"

The choices don't really matter in general, even the disposition of characters doesn't change except for a few throwaway lines. You could be absolutely horrible to a character but they'll still treat you like their best buddy next episode, regardless. Most of the things you say have no impact, and if a character asks you to do something and you say you'd rather not you're forced into doing it anyway. Characters you just met unrealistically expect the most out of you, and the fact that you're an 11 year old is completely ignored most of the time.\n\nThere is little to no constant characterization. You have no development time for any characters, and no time to sit down and get to know people more. You are unable to form actual bonds with characters like you do in season one, and there is little to no backstory for many of the characters you're around. Character development is practically thrown out the window for the most of this season. An entire character's arc from season 1 is brought back for no reason, replayed exactly the same way as it was for the first game. The character himself is brought back and his death scene is ret-conned even though his character arc was resolved in the first season.\n\nYou don't get any kind of closure for any characters. Their character arcs are either small or non-existent in the game and many of them are killed off for shock value and forgotten moments later. Characters you go through the effort of saving either die later in the episode or off screen, pretty much making your effort useless because you don't get any more character development for them, unlike the first season where determinate characters got actual closure and characterization if you save them. Others act out of character enough to get them out of the spotlight.\n\nOlder characters treat you as if everything is your responsibility- You're made to do many tasks and when other character's question this it's quickly shot down by the person forcing you to do it. I get it, Clementine is a certified badass and she's supposed to be growing up, but it gets incredibly ridiculous when you're blamed for not being able to save the lives of some characters and so forth. The one character that is your peer and actually treats you your age gets barely any acknowledgement and is treated terribly through the game.\n\nYou can tell the staff for the second season didn't much care for most of their new characters, not even bothering to defend them in interviews like first season staffers did. I.E.The creative lead and writer of season one, Sean Vanaman, when talking about a rather disliked character in season one, Lilly, challenged people to think about why she acts that way. The season two staff hardly treat their characters with such respect, calling characters useless and terrible. Killing off and keeping characters is determined by how fans receive them and this gives an unfortunate end to many characters and forced screen time to others.\n\nThe game is fast-paced and short, giving you a whopping 9 hours of playtime, and leaves you feeling empty. You push through with no actual goal, plot points picked up and dropped various times throughout the game. The 'big bad' is killed the episode after he's introduced and serves little to no purpose.\n\nI could go on about the things wrong with this game. I pushed through the final episode feeling no emotional attachments to the remaining characters other than Clementine, only finishing to see the resolve of the story. The "multiple endings" are achieved through one simple choice, not determined through how you act in the story, and are over all unsatisfying.\n\nIf you insist on playing the game, I'd recommend buying it when it's on sale. I, regretfully, bought it for full price, and if you're as opinionated as I am you're gonna leave feeling cheated.\n\nalso you still don't get to hug sarah. 0/10. what a ♥♥♥♥ing disgrace","November 15, 2014","false","65.7"," 147 of 262 people (56%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","56","147","262","6","20"

I knew Telltale wouldn't be able to make lightning strike twice, but I had at least expected the quality to be close to the first episode. It wasn't. Especially starting Episode 4, the game really herps itself beyond all derp.\n\nWithout spoiling overmuch, the game's shoddy writing becomes painfully apparent when you realize that your input, as a player, doesn't mean anything. Characters you choose to save get killed off a few minutes later anyway, and characters get a bridge dropped on them as soon as the game feels like shifting the conflict between two different characters. In between is Clementine, who has become a massive Mary Sue in this game, in that everyone wants to win her for themselves - but somehow, no one is actually influenced by what Clementine says or does. Because the game is going for one particular outcome and by God, you are going to GET that particular outcome!\n\nPlot holes abound, and the game keeps trying to go for a cheap Player Punch, and it grates. Especially the conclusion, which is transparent and obvious from miles away - but Hell if Clementine (the character they ALL listen to) can stop anything from happening, since she's utterly useless and only serves as a spectator. Telltale wanted to tell THEIR story, and the player isn't being put in control, but simply dealt with.\n\nPlease think twice before you buy, and if in doubt, get the Wolf Among Us instead, because THAT is quality worthy of Telltale.","August 29, 2014","false","9.0"," 190 of 343 people (55%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","55","190","343","4","22"

On a positive note you can be as ruthless and as much of a sociopath as you wish because most of your fellow survivors aren't very likeable. You survive this season with a bunch of incompetent, overly emotional fools and sycophants.\n\nThat all said, it was much the sameness from the first season and it was enjoyable, just not to the same extent that the first season was.","October 9, 2014","true","8.4"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","2"

Since the people I have heard this from were mostly close friends I believed them, but wanted to give it a try anyway, because that first season was one of the greatest experiences I have ever had in gaming, and I don't typically like point and click games.\n\nSo I bought it while on sale, and I can tell you right now, all those people who said the game wasn't good were just flat out wrong. It is a matter of personal opinion, but in my opinion, the second season is just as good as the first.\n\nI can't say that this sequel is better than the first season, but only because the first season was so incredibly good. But it is not worse either.\n\nI am going to avoid all spoilers, which is going to make this maybe slightly vague, but I will do my best to explain why this is just as good.\n\nThe characters in the second season are just as lovable as in the first. At first you might not realize this, but it is true. The game takes a few characters from the first season and masterfully blends them into a whole new world of new people. You will miss some of the people from season one. That much is certain. But the new characters, and the interactions between them and characters of old, does a good job at making up for it.\n\nYou might also not feel at first glance like your choices make much of a difference, but you will find that the story actually fans out much more than in the first season, and your ending can be completely different than that of others.\n\nAnd I assure you the end will be very satisfying. As I said in my review for the first season, this game will tear out your heart, rip it to pieces, then clumsily glue it together, and feed it back to you. It is the ultimate masochist experience.\n\nI have reached two different endings in this game and I am so amazed by how different they are. The first one left me just shocked, not even sure if I want to replay it. I barely made myself retry the ending, and I am so glad I did so now.\n\nYou will just have to try it yourself, and don't listen to what other people are saying, it is likely they got an ending which was not as satisfying, or didn't even give the game a fair chance. It is just as good as the first, in other ways perhaps, but just as good.\n\nSo if you want to go on the emotional rollercoaster of a lifetime (again), get this game.","November 29, 2015","true","10.1"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","7","7","0","0"

The game forces you to live with your gut’s choices, making it as if you were really in this situation making the choice yourself. This style of narrative is the future of gaming.

Which isn't a bad thing, really. But afterwards, after finishing it, it felt like so much more. Playing as Clementine, burdened with the events of Season 1 gives you a past, a past which haunts you, but also made you who you are today. You can choose to stay a more "nice" Clementine, or you can choose to follow Lee's advice and follow more  survival-esque dialogue decisions. This means you might coerce and use language you're not used to from such a little girl.

Not absolutely outstanding but it had me laughing and crying and I enjoyed it. The puzzles were great, the choices I had to make were difficult and I was always on edge, the characters were well written and I was in tears by the end. This season has been...nothing but a disappointment. I'm not even sorry for saying that.\n\nSecondly, I didn't care about anyone in this season. Literally no one. What I usually say is that Season One was great as I played as Lee and I was always worried about Clem because she was young and I felt very protective of her (as someone with a younger sibling it was easy to fit that role). This season, playing as Clem, I wasn't worried about her anymore. I was supposed to worry about the others in my group and I hated everyone else, I can't think of one character this season that I liked. Now, obviously, that's my opinion, but still. It ruined the story for me. I didn't care who died, I wasn't worried.\n\nLastly, this season was more of a movie or something. I was constantly just sitting around watching characters I hated having conversations that I didn't care about and I felt so incredibly bored. The choices I got to make during conversations were useless. I could have just sat silent through the whole thing and it wouldn't have made a difference in the long run.\n\nBuy it if it's on sale I guess, but I'd just recommend watching someone else play it or go read the wiki if you wanna know what happens. I don't plan on playing the next season anyway, that's the main thing, and that sucks because I was so excited for this season and it just wasn't worth playing imo.\n\nTL;DR - This season was basically 90% walking and talking and 10% actually doing anything of interest, and I'd have had more fun reading the wiki than actually playing this.","August 26, 2014","false","12.3"," 70 of 127 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","70","127","0","12"

It follows the story of Clementine, the kid from The Walking Dead Season 1. An interactive movie-like game with harder and faster decisions to make every time you advance in the storyline. Expectional story writing based on Robert Kirkman's comics, amazing soundtrack. This game makes you take hard decisions, in a maximum of probably 10 seconds each, decisions which all have powerful consequences behind them. You take full responsibility to what might happen after you take the decision and you're afraid of what it might cause, but it also makes you proud of your decisions. You tail how Clemetine's character is, how others see you. It brings out your smartest moves, your worst fears and your craziest sides you didn't even know you had.\n\nOnce you buy the game on Steam you get all the episodes as they come out. Each decision counts, the ones from Season 1 and the DLC aswell. So I suggest buying those before playing this game. Not only the story will make more sense but you'll be more attached to the characters and you'd be happy to know that your past decisions are being counted aswell.\n\nSo there you have it, action, tension, regret, joy, sadness. Above all you need to survive.\n"You're either living or you're not. You ain't little, you ain't a girl, you ain't a boy, you ain't strong or smart.

The story is about the zombie invasion and it is set in a post-apocalyptic setting.\n\nI will keep this review very short and sweet. To start off with, I felt season one was very strong and I loved the feature where season two continued the game based off your season one choices. But as the game continues, it is emotional, intense and really engages the player. All in all, this game is incredible. The artwork is brilliant and it's a massive hit of a game. The game is at a good length at over 9 hours for all five episodes, however there is so much that happens that the length is long.\n\nAnd for feature-related things, its an interactive story so your choices matter, which is a major positive.\n\nI recommend this at any price. I am looking forward to season three. 10/10\n\n----\n\nThanks for reading my review!

It's still primarily an interactive movie revolving around making tough choices and living with the consequences of those choices. While the 2nd season is a decent game, I didn't feel drawn into each character's emotions like the first one. I just felt a sense of distrust in all the characters which made it easy to not get emotionally attached to any of them. The game is also significantly shorter than the first which means there wasn't as much time to form a bond with the characters.

Paticularly in the sense that I felt that the choices you make have less impact on the progression of your story, to the point that the game makes a big deal about giving you the chance to save some characters, only to ignore them for almost an entire chapter before they die anyway. Some of the conflict feels more forced as well, with some characters performing complete 180-degree changes in their attitude because someone needs to start a fight to make things interesting.\n\nBut, that's a lot of criticism for what is still an excellent game. The first two chapters are superb and utterly harrowing, there are quite a number of possible endings and you have complete freedom to decide, and the shift of focus to Clementine as a playable character was an inspired decision.","October 2, 2014","true","7.1"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

While the episodes (1-2) are a little short they are really good and even suspencefull. If you bought season 1 and enjoyed it, your going to want to buy season two as the story picks up only a little after where season 1 left off, and even if you dont own season 1, season 2 is a great place to start the Walking Dead series (implying theres a season 3) The only bad thing about not buying season one is that Lee's choices slightly effect the game in Clementine's story which could possibly bite our ♥♥♥ if Taletell is going to do something drastic with the story if Lee doesnt do a certain thing (Possible Example: Lee decides to leave Clem with Omid when going to Crawford.

I reserve the right to spoil things that you would know by the time you play Season 2.\n\nEpisode 1\nOne of the things that I was most excited about was the fact that the decisions I made during Season 1 would carry over and have an impact in Season 2. And indeed, the game found my save files and imported them properly, but I didn't notice anything during the first episode that had anything to do with what I had done during Season 1.\n\nBeing that Clementine is a lot smaller than Lee, the combat played out much differently. Instead of struggling with the zombies and trying to bash their heads in, Clementine usually runs and dodges away from whatever is chasing her. There were also far fewer puzzles, and those that were present were fairly straightforward. Honestly most of the episode was a continuous push forward, with few hub areas to simply explore and talk to people.\n\nOverall I would call this episode a setup episode. Telling you what it is setting up would be a spoiler, but it might be in your best interest to wait and find out how good the next episode is before deciding whether or not to buy the whole season.\n\nEpisode 2\nI wasn't really sure what to expect from the second episode because the first episode didn't have much going on in it. I didn't know enough about the group of people I met to make predictions about what was going to happen. Luckily the second episode picks things up; well, it's not lucky for the characters in the game, but you know what I mean.\n\nThe most important thing that happens in this episode is the people in your new group get fleshed out more in a big way. The Walking Dead would fail completely if it didn't have strong characters that you care about. I found myself drawn to the people in the group to varying degrees, much as I would in real life.\n\nThe biggest challenge Telltale faces in this game is finding ways to give the player agency in ways that make sense for an 11 year old girl. For the most part I think they succeeded, though there were a few exceptions; for example, who would leave Clementine alone to figure out how to turn off a wind turbine?\n\nUnfortunately I cannot go into the best things about this episode without spoiling everything, but trust me: The Walking Dead 2 is officially now worth getting. There were a lot of surprises, which I was not expecting. I thought I was prepared for anything that Telltale could throw at me, but I was very wrong.\n\nMuch like the first episode, they end with a huge cliffhanger. If you hate dealing with those, you might want to wait until the third episode comes out, but that will probably end on a cliffhanger as well. I'm enjoying playing it one episode at a time, but I wish I had somebody I could discuss things with.\n\nEpisode 3\nThis episode was structured very differently from the other episodes we've seen so far from The Walking Dead. It almost felt like the story it told could stand on its own, with some fleshing out of course. In particular the ending had so much closure I'm not sure where they are going to take the series next, other than the obvious problem of continuing to survive in a zombie apocalypse.\n\nMy favorite thing about this episode was how Clementine really came into her own. In previous episodes the writers came up with ways for her to influence events without being the main actor. Here she does almost everything that is needed for the group's plans to work. Of course one of the characters brings up how crazy this is, so the writers were not unaware of the stretch they were taking here. I hope this opens up the door for Clementine to do even more cool stuff.\n\nI believe that I have now seen all of the characters from the 400 Days DLC, though most of them showed up briefly and had very few lines. I am looking forward to seeing them more in future episodes. If Telltale doesn't use them more I am going to be pretty disappointed.\n\nThis episode didn't let up on The Walking Dead's tendency to be emotionally taxing. I kept alternating between cheering characters on and cursing at the screen when things went wrong. And that's just the way I like it.\n\nEpisode 4\nAmid the Ruins brings us back to the more familiar Telltale formula, with action sequences interspersed with characters talking while walking and even a hub area where you can take a break and look around a Civil War memorial.\n\nI mentioned in the last episode that Clementine carried the group in a way that is not normal for an 11 year old girl. This episode did feature Clementine contributing heavily, but not in ways that felt forced by the writers. The flow and pace of the episode felt much more natural, with almost no moments that pulled me out of the game.\n\nThere were even a few genuinely humorous moments, mostly provided by my new favorite character, Mike. I wish he had gotten a chance to shine earlier, and I certainly hope that they do not kill him off. Small chance of that.\n\nEpisode 5\nI was hoping that I would be able to make it through a season finale of The Walking Dead without making any decisions I immediately regretted or crying. I failed. It was a fool's hope anyway.\n\nMuch like the finale of season one, there were very few times where they give the player the opportunity to take a break and look around. It was mostly a constant push towards the end of the episode. They did give the characters a break at one point, which also let me become more attached to them. This was no doubt part of their grand plan to break my heart, but those are not things that you realize while playing.\n\nThere was one situation that I saw coming from a mile away because the writers focused on it so much for the last couple of episodes. On the other hand there was another closely related situation that I did not see coming at all.\n\nAs a whole I enjoyed the second season of Telltale's The Walking Dead, though not as much as the first season. I would say that the main factor was the faster turnover of characters. I did not get enough time to get attached to most of the characters before they died or were otherwise removed from the group. I cannot remember many of their names, or how they died. In contrast I remember almost all of the characters from season one.\n\nI am not sure if Telltale will make a third season, and frankly I am not sure how wise it would be for them to try. It is easy for the player to become jaded to the loss they are constantly subjected to in this series. The second season also had much less of a cultural impact; out of my Steam friends, the number of people who have played the second season is less than half that of the first. I would certainly play a third if they made it though.","March 18, 2014","true","8.8"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

How many times have you made a decision in a game, and regretted it (while knowing full well that you made the right choice for yourself, or for the greater good, whatever your perspective). If you are willing to let yourself play a game and feel these, and other emotions, The Walking Dead: Season 2 is for you.\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed Season 1 and was pleased to play this through, often so engrossed in the story that I would play through an entire chapter at a time. The writing is tremendous, the characters are interesting (and often tragic), and the gameplay, while not twitchy, is satisfying for how it can make you feel as if you are a real part of the story.\n\nI realise that you likely have read a dozen other reviews praising this game, and that you know how amazing it already is, but this is as much for me as it is for you - I will not feel complete until I have recommended this title to the public, and maybe, just maybe, helped another person experience this masterpiece.","November 19, 2014","true","8.3"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

TWD: Season 2 does improve over TWD: Season 1 in some ways, while the experience is still littered w/ fantastic storytelling, character development, and important decisions to make. If you weren't a fan of TWD: S1, I don't think S2 will sway you into becoming a fan of the series, as this series and these style of games just might not be for you (i.e. adventure games mixed with a lot of interactive story elements - such as Fahrenheit / Indigo Prophecy and The Walking Dead: Season 1).\n\nOften, a lot of the decisions the player makes as Clementine during this zombie-apocalypse, you will have very limited time to make a decision, which makes often for a very gripping & intense experience. Like the previous season, things are often very intense here. You will have to make decisions here in this bleak game-world, which will cause rifts between yourself and the other people in the group that are trying to survive in this zombie-apocalypse - and this is where a lot of the tension comes from. Also, adding to the tension is that this game is so focused on story + character development, that characters you will care about - well, you'll have to make a decision on what to do. Since this is TWD - expect making bleak + dark decisions, which often are in the realm of choosing b/t gray-clouded areas. Often, players will be choosing b/t the lesser of a few evils; or making what feels like a the morally good decision where the outcome is just still down-right horrible.\n\nJust like with S1, S2's story + character, & decision-making stuff is pushed into the forefront. In this Season, you are Clementine (who returns from Season 1, but is now fully playable this time around). Clementine is stuck with a group of mostly new survivors, who are trying to stay alive in this zombie-apocalypse. This is what the game actually is. If you're looking for a typical type of game with challenge put forth in combat, puzzles, and things of that nature - don't. This is not that kind of game.\n\nThough, S2 feels like it often offers up more action sequences in the previous season.  If you were hoping for more action sequences in S2, you'll probably be happy with that change. With that change, though - it feels like there are less puzzles offered than what was in the previous Season. S2 feels a bit more on-rails, less areas to explore, and less items often in the inventory - which can makes these puzzles a lot easier than what was in Season 1. While this is labeled as an adventure game, do not expect mind-numbing puzzles: most of these puzzles are very logical and very easy to figure out. If you were hoping they'd improve that by having more difficult puzzles or another difficulty to offer up tougher puzzles, don't. Actually, the puzzles in S1 - which weren't even remotely hard, anyways - were a bit more challenging.\n\nWhen you make choices + decisions, they will often shape the journey of the experience itself in certain ways. They might even make the final outcome of the game different even. Having a bit of a different journey itself and final outcome, for fans - this could make the game worth any replays they would want to give the game. Since you can import directly from S1 + 400 Days DLC, in which your decisions can matter from those - there could even be reasons to replay and start from S1, play 400 Days, and then run S2.\n\nWhen it comes down all to it, after around 9.5 hours w/ this game (according to Steam), The Walking Dead: Season 2 is an excellent adventure game + interactive story. If you were not a fan of TWD: Season 1, then I don't think TWD: S2 will turn you into a fan of the series. While the experience is fantastic, it still offers up a lot more of the same greatness that came forth in S1. Great characters, storytelling, voice-acting, dialogue, and decision-making are what make this game as great as it. If you haven't played S1, well - you should start with S1 and then play 400 Days DLC b/c your saved-games can be imported right into S2. While TWD: S2 does not have the freshness of a new experience that Season 1 offered up, TWD: S2 is still great and most definitely worth experiencing for fans of TWD: Season 1 and those into a mix of adventure games + interactive stories.\n\nFinal Grade = A-.","February 1, 2015","true","9.5"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Clementine is more exposed and vulnerable than Lee was - she is after all still a child. But she's not just physical plant since the first game. Here she is more capable : able to handle weapons, use the environment to their advantage and have basic survival skills . This requires the need that she must use their accumulated knowledge to cope.\n\nHow and what I choose Clementine to say or do will have consequences later on. These choices - that must be done on time, is the essence of the game. The moral choices are of course the most exhausting. Should I help a character or not? Who should I save the life of? There is no right answer. But as the game quickly and well manage to establish the characters, there is an emotional effort on my part, that makes these choices grab. It gets heavy, ruthless and crippling to see terrible events pass and know that I could have chosen differently.\n\nClementine is superbly written, feels incredibly human in their desperation and loneliness, and proves at the same time smart, stubborn and have good instincts. Clementine was in the last game chiselled sympathetic and courageous. Here she gets an expanded emotional spectra, through the choices you make - she may, for example, behave suspiciously , sad or friendly. She becomes a much more interesting person and in the coming episodes will hopefully evolve even more.","March 8, 2014","true","5.2"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/emperorgandhi/recommended/261030/","emperorgandhi","[CotC] King Conga Gandhi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/emperorgandhi/","194 products in account","WARNING: SPOILERS FROM THE WALKING DEAD: SEASON 1!!!\n\n\n\n\nI might as well get this out of the way, I bawled when Lee died in the first game. That probably isn't a shocker. However, what makes this statement shocking is the fact that even after I knew the death scene through and through beforehand (before I even played the game, heck, even before I considered it) I still bawled. It's hard enough to make someone truly cry from a game's wonderful story, but for Telltale to do that but still make me cry after I knew it was coming, well, that's something I've never seen pulled off by a game before. Where am I going with this? The ending alone from season one set up some pretty ridiculously high expecations for S2.\n\nAfter my first playthrough, I was definitely satisfied, but not like I was with Season 1. I still shed a few tears during some parts of the game (the 5th episode was REALLY emotional) and like I said, I was most certainly satisfied with my purchase.\n\n\nGraphics\nAlthough keeping the same style as the first season, I can tell it is far more detailed. Some of the newer characters look great. The environments also look beautiful and I haven't taken that many screenshots like that since Skyrim IIRC. However, I noticed that sometimes the characters would glitch out, plus the voices and mouth movement was pretty inaccurate. But, if you don't pay attention to that kind of stuff, you'll enjoy the graphics.\n\nGameplay\nObviously, this is the low point of the game. But, it did seem downgraded compared to the first game. The gameplay still has QTEs but now has a severe lacking of puzzles compared to other point-and-click games. Although there are some understandable reasons (An 11 year old girl and a 37 year old grown man, look at the difference) and so Clementine, despite being a strong girl, still isn't capable of doing some tasks. However, that doesn't mean they had to take out the puzzles altogether and double the amount of QTEs. However, there were lots of tough decisions, if not many, many more than the first season. However, I would prefer the decision-making be classified in the "story" section instead. Another con I noticed is that the game was only 9 hours. Very short. Overall, the gameplay definitely fell short to me.\n\nStory\nThis is the car engine. A human's heart. The thing that keeps them alive. In this case, the story for The Walking Dead. And I have to say, the story was 100x darker than the first game. HOWEVER, it didn't truly escalate until the last episode. Even without Lee, this story was brilliantly told. You even reunite with Kenny and his new girlfriend Sarita but you also realize he is, well, becoming insane. The cast is much better than the last season, for sure. There was Jane, who treats you like her deceased sister, Luke, who is one of the only characters who isn't crazy, and even Bonnie from the 400 Days DLC. They're all friendly, but then the final episode is where it truly gets dark. This is where I believe the story falls a bit short. The first season started getting dark (in a bad, yet good way) around the third episode, while this one gets emotional around the finale. I'm not saying the other episodes sucked, but it took some time to truly enjoy the experience. But, the other episodes didn't suck. Something sad will happen in each one that somehow scars another character or even Clementine. For once, I didn't find anyone truly annoying, but I HATE Arvo (intended by TT of couse) but he wasn't an annoying character compared to the one-dimensional fillers from the first season. I would say the saddest part (without spoiling too much) is when you have a dream about Lee in the last episode. "Promise me you won't leave me" gets me every time. Plus, if you pull the right strings, Kenny's ending can be very, very emotional. He's the only character (besides Clem) who didn't die in the first season. In the end, the story is amazing, but it wasn't as emotional as season 1.\n\nAudio\nThe amazing voice acting is back. Everyone, and literally, EVERYONE, played their roles beautifully. Carver was a truly terrifying villain with a voice and personality like his, Clementine also has an amazing voice actor. And for once, NO ONE WAS ACTUALLY ANNOYING! Well, Carlos had some quotes that made me facepalm. He REALLY needs to take an IQ test. The music was pretty good, but I felt it was lacking something. But, either way, the voice actors make up for the music.\n\nReplayability\nAlthough the replayability isn't usually intended to be high, the story will stick with you for years and years. Trust me, The Walking Dead's plot makes the TV version look bad.\n\nVerdict\nIn the end, Season 2 did live up to expectations, despite the fact it had quite a few flaws and also wasn't as good as the first season was. Either way, if you loved the first game, you'll enjoy playing this game and playing in the shoes of Clementine!\n\nGraphics- 9.0/10\nGameplay- 3.0/10\nStory- 9.0/10\nAudio- 9.5/10\nReplayability- 7.0/10\n\n.:8.6/10:.\n\n+Outstanding cast\n+Amazing voice acting\n+Tougher decisions\n+Enhanced visuals\n+Amazing finale\n\n-Took time for the story to become emotional\n-Music fell flat\n-Too many QTEs\n-Short","December 4, 2014","true","9.3"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

With this said, I'll tell you why I recommended  this game.\nLet's talk about the story. Just excellent. We have 5 episodes (like the first one) which ones became better and better. The dialogues are great and the new characters feels fresh. Voice acting for every single characters are all well done. I personally feel the story intense, there are parts with a lot of action, also there are some fun parts and of course, the sad moments.\nThe gameplay is pretty much like the first one, point n click adventure with moments of dialogues. Nothing to complain about it.\nOne of my favorite things about this game is the soundtrack, especially the ones when you are in the middle of hard decisions. That was one thing I really loved from the first one, the soundtrack.\n\nMy final words are:\n\nFor me, this is a 9/10 game.

Take note that this game series is not based on the TV series, but rather an adapted version of the original comic book series by Robert Kirkman.\n\nIn this sequel, you play as Clementine, taking on the zombified world by yourself. Much to my surprise, many of the "adult" characters in this game rely on you for making key decisions, so it seems that when the world ends, children will have the swing votes in most cases.\n\nThe game really continues the great look and feel that it's predecessor had left for us.

Season 1 gave us a hell of a ride on the feels train. Season Two now has Clementine taking the main role as the protagonist. She refers to what Lee taught her when she talks about her past experiences, which is a really important part of the story. It's what really links Season one and two together. Over the past few episodes of season two, the character development progresses one chapter at a time. The choices you make CAN effect the main story line, but some of these are small and won't set back the story at all. However, dire decisions where you have to choose between certain characters, whether they live or die, really adds the tension. When these dire choices happen, it will have you in a moment of slow-motion, then you have to act quickly as the decision bar runs out. The dialog is getting better and better each episode. However, I wish Telltale would make longer episodes once in a while. Sometimes they can seem short, but as they say; 'Time flies while you're having fun'. And Season Two so far, is proving that games don't need to be AAA, have groundbreaking graphics to be a good gaming experience. It's the story that draws us in, we want to find out what happens the next episode. We want to know how these choices affect our story and the characters themselves. Some characters will return from Season One and 400 Days. There will be twists and turns on this train track of feels, but Telltale does a damn good job!","May 19, 2014","true","11.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","1"

The HUD looks way better. There aren't as many bugs as the first one although I didn't get any achievements from the last episode. The biggest improvement is that YOUR CHOICES MATTER. The first game your choices had little to no effect in the game, characters you chose to save died at the same time, did basically the same things and overall didn't have any effect on how the story was told. This game it truly matters. And also, the ending I got (yes there are multiple endings, crazy I know) was on par with the first game's ending if not even better.\nNow on to the "bad" things. I found that the characters were more bland than the last game. Don't get me wrong, there were some great ones, but mostly I didn't care about them at all. Now as I've finished the game I feel like I only could name 3 or 4 charracters besides Clementine. The only lack lusster character in the first game in my opinion was Omid, but this game seems like around a third of them were just boring. i also have to mention that no song of the soundtrack stuck with me at all, in the first game two songs REALLY stuck with me, which were "Kenny's theme" and "Take us back". This is nitpicking but I have to say it.\nThe story itself is good but I feel like the quality of the episodes is all over. The 2nd and 5th episodes were amazing, but the rest, I feel, were around 7/10.\nAnyways, if you liked the first walking dead game I highly recommend you buy this one too.","August 28, 2014","true","8.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

You play as Clementine, the unforgettable little girl rescued from her tree house by Lee in Season 1. Having the perspective of a young girl and making decisions for her is an interesting and welcomed change from playing as a grown man in Season 1.\n\nAs you immerse yourself and see her growth based on the decisions you've made, you realize just how different and refreshing it is to be playing as a child. It somewhat reminds me of Arya's change throughout the Game of Thrones books & show.\n\nThough not required, I'd highly recommend playing the 400 Days DLC since you will run in to some of these characters in Season 2, and the choices you make in the 400 Days DLC (and Season 1) will be carried over into Season 2.\n\nThe interactive action scenes that require a near split second response happen much more frequently than in Season 1 and they are a bit more challenging as well, offering a comfortable mixture of gameplay.\n\nPROS:\nSlightly more polished and smooth graphics\nMore interactive action scenes\nClementines child perspective is intriguing\n\nCONS:\nDecision Selection:  If you played Season 1, you probably remember that your choices were displayed in a vertical list and you could either mouse scroll or use numbers 1-4 to select, aiding in reading faster and making decisions more easily and intuitive.\nIn Season 2, your choices are displayed to you in 4 huge boxes that span the entire bottom of the screen and you must drag the mouse pointer to select. This may seem trivial to some, and while I don't consider myself a slow reader, I still feel it  takes away from those split seconds that you have to make up your mind.  While I understand that split-second decision making is an important part of the game, I find the new, large, "prettier" GUI non-intuitive and distracting.\nI much preferred the "bare bones" interface from Season 1, where you could easily see your choices in one small area and scroll through with the mouse wheel (or numbers) to select a decision.\nIt is what it is and not a game breaker, just personal preference.\n\nMouse Speed: An option from Season 1 that they removed. You can't change the sensitivity within the game itself (seriously?).  Since there are more interactive action scenes, some which require semi-precise mouse pointing during shaky gameplay, I find it really silly that this option is not available in game and you'll need to change your mouse speed in the system until you find a sensitivity that's right.\n\nGlitchy Rewind Option: I honestly thought at first that Season 2 didn't even have a Chapter Rewind option because it took 2 separate 2 hour gaming sessions for it to just finally magically appear without me doing anything. Again, not a game breaker, but why isn't this bug fixed after nearly a year and a half after release? There were quite a few times I would have liked to rewind and try a different scenario.\n\nDespite these complaints, I still rate Season 2 very highly and would recommend it to anyone who's interested.","May 16, 2015","true","23.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

You now control a 11 year old Clementine which makes the world feel even more dangerous since taking down a single walker takes multiple strikes because she lacks the strength to destroy the brain. It is a shame we don't get to play as 9 year old Clem and suddenly get a jump cut saying “16 months later”  with nothing else added on how she survived or what she went through when she was most vulnerable. That doesn't mean she won't be in danger though, as she will be receiving plenty of horrific injuries. Her voice is no longer high pitched and cute like in Season 1, she now sounds depressed after all the stuff she has been through. And since it has been so long after the outbreak most of the survivors are very selfish and jaded or just flatout insane.\n\nNothing has really changed from Season 1 besides the story and a few new inputs during quick time events.  There are much less puzzles and less chances to talk to characters while walking around. They will usually just repeat one line and tell you to do something which helps keep up the pace of the game but also has less time to flesh out the characters.  It makes sense that they wouldn't want to converse with a little girl but it comes off as a bit silly how dependent they are on her at times. This time around they focus a lot more on human evil and pull it off very well. You will frequently feel intimidated by the insane people and more so by the people at your side as they start to lose it. Which brings me to the choices. It makes since that most people will ignore what you want to do but when you do make a choice it feels a lot less satisfying than in Season 1. They just feel lazy and the outcome will feel the same no matter what you pick, making it feel less like a choose your own adventure game and more like a point and click game with occasional dialogue choices.\n\nThe game feels like it was rushed out before they could fine tune it to the quality of the first. Not that I'm saying it is a bad sequel though. I personally enjoyed it more than the first due to the helplessness of playing as a child. It is a very “fun” and tragic journey that I refuse to spoil here.  Not bad at all if you don't compare it to the original. Though one thing I just have to mention is that they make you sit through the credits that lists the whole staff and their pets five times. That's just unnecessary but at the very least they throw in some good music each time. Still if you liked the first season and want to know what happens next this is a very solid purchase that is every bit as emotional as the last season.","February 9, 2015","true","18.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Beware of S1 spoilers if you have not played it.\nStepping into the shoes of the now 11-year-old Clementine felt natural after the departure of Lee last season. But she seems to embody him in everything she does, and Telltale gives you the opportunity to make ballsy and often heart wrenching choices the way you think is right, same as the first season.\n\nOne of the complaints of the first season is it's a tad linear. Don't get me wrong, it's an amazing game, but the dozens of decisions we agonized over in Season 1 all ended up taking us to the same ending anyway. It was disappointing to make a tough call, be curious what direction the other choices would have taken me, reload the save and redo the decision, only to find out I ended up in the same place anyway.\n\nSeason 2 rectifies the linearity of the first one, especially in the ending department. In fact, if Telltale continues with the Clementine storyline, Season 3 is going to be one hell of an undertaking, considering the multiple different places (and people!) you had the possibility to end with in S2. It's almost for this reason I feel a third season wouldn't pick up directly where the second season left off. Sure, there will always be the people you can't save, and I'd reload a save file only to watch my favorite character die a different way, but overall, I was happy in feeling my decisions had an impact on the outcome.\n\nWhen reading through some other reviews, one thing a lot of players agreed on is not feeling as connected to the cast as the first season. I can definitely see this, and I do agree I wasn't as invested in most of the characters, and didn't care about many of their inevitable deaths (sounds terrible, but it's true). However, there are enough characters I did find myself caring deeply about. Those are the ones TWD centers on, and that's what's important.\n\nTo quote another reviewer, "I miss Lee." I do too, but Season 2 does a great job in convincing me everything I did last season wasn't in vain.","February 10, 2015","true","11.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I wrote a review for season 1 where i explained that i felt a deep connection to the characters, this time around it was pretty much the same and much like the first game i just didnt want the story to end it was so good.\nWith each chapter of the season you will make good and bad decisions its just how the game is, my advice is try just not to do the right thing but just try to become the character and decide for yourself, the story works best this way in the long run.\n\nI cannot praise telltale enough for making these amazing games with the amazing storylines and character progression.\n\n9.5/10 if you havent played these games yet do so already!  You don't know what you're missing.\nCant wait for Season 3!!!","March 30, 2015","true","10.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/larexus/recommended/261030/","larexus","Larexus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/larexus/","433 products in account","Another great story in the Walking dead universe told by TellTale games,\nhowever this time I couldn't help but feel like something was missing.\n\n-------Final Thoughts at the end-------\n\nGameplay\nJust like the first game in the series(and most of TellTale's other games) the gameplay is a mix between point and click, puzzle solving, and quicktime events. The puzzle situations are not hard nor are they long which helps a story heavy game like this keep moving at a steady pace. Most of them are, find the item and use it on whats blocking you, or use items in a certain order. You can explore around most areas and find other things to interact with in the world and sometimes may find another way to solve a problem. Quick time events will happen during some cutscenes, but are not to bad to react too(lots of mash Q then press E)\n\nFor the most part the gameplay is your average point and click adventure game with the addition of quick time events.\n\nGraphics\nThe art design is the beautiful cell shaded art that we come to know and love from TellTale. The levels and areas are well designed and gorgeous to look at. The characters are well crafted and fit perfectly into the world around them. Cutscenes look smooth on my medium spec PC and have no framerate issues, even my girlfriend runs this game smoothly on her low end PC.\n\nAudio\nAudio is well done and makes you feel part of the world whether it be the stumbling feet of zombies from the world around you or the sweet ambience sound of the forest. The voice acting is well done and the voices fit the characters they were chosen for. The emotion is made aparent through the voice acting.\n\nStory\nI'm not going to give any information about the story line here, I will simply explain how the story line felt. The story line flowed smoothly and you can see the concequences of your actions take place, however I felt like no matter what choice you made their was no real "saving them", they would simply just die another way soon after. Also after playing through the game I felt like something was missing, I felt I had no real connection to any of the characters, they kind of just came and gone. This has to be my biggest issue with the game, this may have been because the story was not as intimate as Lee's and Clementine's was. I felt like TellTale just couldn't capture that same feeling in Season 2.\n\nSummary\nAt the end of it all, The Walking Dead: Season 2 is a great game to pick up and play as it will take you through an amazingly well crafted story in a beautiful cell shaded design. Its hard to put down because the story keeps you engaged and you will find yourself wanting to keep going to find out what happens next. I would recommend playing the first season first as it will help you understand the storyline better and help show the changes made in clementine.","January 13, 2015","true","9.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Season 1 of Telltale's The Walking Dead was my favourite game of 2012 and I got introduced to the whole franchise through that game. Because of that, I've pre-ordered S2, which is something that I've never done with a Telltale game before. (I do appreciate my efforts for trying it out something new, playing the game from the start and waiting for the upcoming Episodes, but I also regret it a bit because of the waiting between Episodes)\n\nSeason 2 had a rough start, some really unmemorable characters and it basically lacked any central plot.

Season 1 had better writing and memorable characters, while Season 2 had more creativity.

I would say the sequel manages to be even grimmer than the first game primarily by making a child the main character of the story and putting her through some pretty dark things by the end of it. Although it does take a while to sink in that a group of adults is deferring to a hyper-competent child to get things done most of the time but then again this is a Clementine show through and through, whether by making us witness her character growth and making her the decision maker in contrast with the first season. Story-wise it's about another group of survivors, their circumstances and how Clementine fits into all of it, although it also heavily hinges on a returning major character from the first season and a LOT of the impact will depend on how attached you were to said character.\n\nThis will either be a major boon or major bane in the last episode which is somewhat weaker than the rest and leads to an, for me personally at least, unsatisfying ending. Another negative, aside from Telltale's traditional life long quest to remove more and more of the actual gameplay from player's hands, is the fact that most characters from 400 Days are used in a very expendable manner when a whole lot more could've been done with them.","December 3, 2014","true","8.3"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Full stop.\n\n...\n\nWell ok, for a review it ain't worth it.\n\nSo, if you've played previous Walking Dead 1, you'll see this game has exact same graphic design, music/OSTs and gameplay. Copy paste, just different scenario/dialogue/characters (some are familiars like Clementine or Kenny). There's an annoying thing of credit scrolling after every chapter ends, though. Bearable, but mildly annoying.\n\nGame's split into five chapters, each chapter will give you a brief review of how you acted on that particular act and compare it with other players. Game's not that long, like what, six hours at most? No replay value either, once you beat it, you'll get full achievements. Just maybe want to rewind some parts where you made choices that had different outcome of who would have survived.\n\nThe real shining point is its story. You'll still be forced to show your true color in a dire need. If it's your first playthrough, most likely it's YOU who YOU are if YOU were in the position Clementine is in. This is what makes Walking Dead good, you are immersed by the story and imagine what would you do from the bottom of your heart. You'll be very attached to the characters you play and meet in the game. Not many games do have this ability to engage their playerbase.\n\nSo what are you waiting for? If you've picked this up on previous sale, download it and play. You will really appreciate what this game has to offer.","January 9, 2015","true","27.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

Crueler, more interesting and with tougher choices.\n\nAt first I was reluctant to play as Clementine, knowing that Lee taught her to be a good little girl with high moral standards which would be kinda boring. But in a year long gap between two season Clementine matured a lot and became tougher. Even though everyone says that she's just a child and can't survive on her own, she constantly proves them wrong and shows that she clearly adapts better to zombie apocalypse than adults. Can't say much about other characters in this game. Some are good-written, some aren't and some are killed before you can begin to sympathize with them.\n\nAnd this brings us to the main flaw of Telltale Games' games - your choices do not matter as much as you may think. Yeah, sometimes your choice would lead to the death of some character but about 2/3 of them die anyway and you can't do anything about that, so if you play the game again you may find out that that one time, when you were desperately thinking should you rob a guy with medicine or not, does not matter - that guy is still being robbed, if not by you, than by your partner.\n\nGameplay-wise it's the same game, since there is no point in changing working mechanics of story-driven interactive movie. And once again I want to note an amazing soundtrack by Jared Emerson-Johnson which blends really well with storytelling and beautiful on it's own. A real shame Telltale Games still haven't released it or the one from the previous game for sale.\n\nOverall it's a good experience, still better than TV series, season 3 when?","March 29, 2015","true","9.7"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","83","5","6","3","0"

If you've played Season 1 and/or the 400 Days DLC, your actions will carry over to this Season.\n\nTelltale managed to keep the pace up on this one and I feel that this time, the decision making situations were alot more intense. This is one of those games that you can't really exemplify because by doing so I'd be ruining it for you. What can I say is that if you've really enjoyed The Walking Dead Season 1, I'm pretty sure you'll enjoy playing through Season 2, it has alot going for it and I'm eager to see how Season 3 turns out.","August 29, 2014","true","11.8"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

I was incredibly emotional through Season 1. Cried my eyes  out after every episode. Could not play more than one episode in a day. For season 2, I played 4 episodes in one day and didn't shed a tear. No sniffles. No, that does not make me cold hearted. We follow Clementine immediately after Season 1 and follow her journey. Clementine is amazing. This is both the games strength and weakness. We all love Clementine. She has been through a lot of stuff. However, all the adults around her put way too much responsiblity on her, making all the adults in this game look incompetent. There isn't really a Lee/Clementine dynamic. There were characters that I liked, but I never felt a connection with them like I did in Season 1. I will still play a Season 3 if one comes out, just out of love of Clementine.  If you are interested in Clementine's story and willing to put up with some weak story and character points, its worth it. I found this flawed game interesting and intriguing enough to play through to the end, and hope for the best for the survivors.

Whether this is the final season or not doesn't really matter as the ending brings kind of closure what happens.

I had hopes that this breakout series from Telltale would iterate, evovle, and build upon the formula. I imagine a story that we could each steer to our slightly unique destination. And why wouldn't they have the funds to do this given the success the first season. But it has not come to pass.\n\nThe first season gave us a hard road with small detours that ultimately led to the same conclusion. It never lived up to the promise of 'Mass Effect with zombies', but it compensated with some intense situations and choices which mattered - at least in the short term, over an episode or three. Sure, if you tugged at the strings hard enough, the illusion came crashing down, but you had the feeling that an honest effort was made, one perhaps tempered by realistic budgets. By contrast, the path laid out by season two is largely a straight line, with "choices" often being resolved within the very same dialoge tree. Choosing the "Silence option" in conversation often results in the other character responding with a suitably vague response that would have adequately covered the other three conversational choices. The dramatic "end of episode" choice you make in episode 3 is revealed to have had almost no input into episode 4, being resolved in the first 30 seconds. And I have no reason to expect that the almost identical choice you make at the end of episode 4 will play out any differently. I am ameniable to granting the game a suspension of disbelief, but that doesn't mean you should take advantage of that. This violates the contract between player and game and you find yourself increasingly unwilling to give them the benefit of the doubt. You need to put forth a little more effort to make this more than a two hour cutscene. The end of episode "Important decisions" screens are telling - "Who did you sit with at dinner" is not an meaningful gameplay choice.\n\nSo I get what they're saying. There is no stable family group for Clementine. She is adrift in an unforgiving world, and making bonds with other characters is hardly worth the effort because everyone leaves in the end. And you fall into that rhythm along with her. It's easy to throw in the towel. "Jimbo will remember that" means little when he's out of the picture 20 minutes later. And when you have half an episode to make a connection to a character, there's no real sense of tragedy when they're gone. Contrast this to the first season when a beloved character was mauled or shot. Has the magic been dispelled, or have we just become numb to tragedy, or was it an intentional design? Being helpess to save anyone but yourself may be an important lesson, but it is an unsatisfying pill for a player to swallow when we are expected to play out that role in someone else's shoes. We don't have enough time in each episode to have this lesson be the bittersweet one they want us to see. It's presented too fast out of necessity, and becomes trivialized.\n\nSo if we can't explore deep relationships with other characters, that narrows the domain of notable choices down to ones related to our character's environmental situation. However Clementine is not old enough to make any fundamental decisions about her adventure. I agree with this. She shouldn't be making any of the major calls for the group. Clementine is a young girl, but as players we bring the benefit of wisdom to her choices. Thankfully the game doesn't force us to make silly childish decisions, but neither does making her a battle hardened survivor who abitrates all group decisions feel quite right. Not yet. But that leads us to the question. If the themes that are being explored do not particularly lend themselves to an interactive format, then is this the story that should have been told? We're stuck in limbo here, with no easy solution in sight.\n\nWhat's more, fewer of the situations are as captivating. Think back on the first four episodes of season 2 and try to remember anything that really stood out. The dog. The, um. Christmas ornament.  Can you remember what happened in episode two? I think an ingredient is missing.\n\nI think this form of storytelling has legs and Telltale is onto a fantastic idea with their recent games including Wolf among us. I enjoy the time I sit down with each episode. I'm being critical and a little hard on Season 2 because I see such a bright future here and I look forward to new installments of these series a great deal. They are fantastic games you can play alone, or play with a friend, or play separately and then talk about the next day. They are powerful stories and you are at the heart of them. Yet, a little reflection shows that we still have a long ways to go with this format, and I am already impatient waiting for progress. But if it isn't Telltale which brings us to that next plateau -- then who?","July 28, 2014","true","11.9"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","1"

The story doesn't catch you as much as season 1 does.\nOne funny fact: You don't need the save game file of season 1 at all. If you start playing season 2 the game searches for a save game file of season 1. If the game found it you have to chose the save game file. In season 1 I have 2 different save game files. On my 2nd walkthrough I always have chosen other answers, for example in my first walkthrough I let Lee slowly turning into a walker and on my 2nd walkthrough I shot him in the end. Now to the funny part: After having chosen your save game file, the season 2 game always shows (in a short way) what happened in season 1, ALWAYS showing Lee in the end slowly turning into a walker even if you may have shot him in the end. That is why you don't need season 1 and I do not know why the game searches for a season 1 save game file.\nAnd my second funny fact:\nSome answer options are absolutely unnessecary. An example: In the beginning of the game I answered Christa something about Omid when we were in the woods. It showed "Christa will remember that", but damn it, you don't see Christa in the entire game anymore, so where da **** will she remember it? There are several situations like that where it shows "X/Y will remember it", but 1 moment later the person is gone for the entire game or is dead 2 seconds later. Maybe some decisions are important for the future season, but as you don't need season 1 at all maybe you don't need season 2 at all for season 3 which would be really really bad because there are 5 possible endings in season 2. If season 3 starts randomly in a place where you shouldn't be because of the ending you have chosen, then it is an epic fail. :P\n\nAnyway, it's a nice game, has a nice setting, but doesn't catch you as season 1 did. I'm a big fan of The Walking Dead, loved season 1 and I had to buy season 2. It is still alright to play it, but season 1 was better. :) Still, those who played season 1 must buy this game. :)","October 5, 2014","true","28.7"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","7","10","0","6"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dynsay/recommended/261030/","dynsay","Dynsay","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dynsay/","1091 products in account","Unfortunately, that’s really the extent of the effect you have on The Walking Dead’s narrative. Like in season one, picking sides causes people to react to you in different ways, but the plot still moves forward just the same. Decide to steal someone’s medicine or let them go; you’ll be in the same spot regardless of what you end up doing. Occasionally your choices will affect who lives or dies, but everything always ends up reverting to some kind of status quo. Moment to moment, The Walking Dead is thrilling, and it feels like your choices matter--examine it too closely and you realize that you’re merely given the illusion of choice. It’s no worse than the first season, but it ends up feeling more obvious the second time around.\n\nStill, while the choices you make might not necessarily affect the overall story, they certainly affect how you feel about its numerous characters. I was worried that season two wouldn’t be able to deliver characters as compelling as the ones we got in season one, and that’s certainly the first impression I got when Clementine stumbles upon this new group. But over time, you get to know them and really connect with them as people. Luke attaches himself to Clementine as a surrogate big-brother, and the badass lone-wolf Jane teaches her how to survive at all costs. Even Carver, the megalomaniacal head of a budding utopia (and voiced by a scene-stealing Michael Madsen) feels relatable--his my-way-or-your-face-smashed-on-the-highway approach to leadership is extreme, but in the end, he’s only doing what he thinks he needs to do to survive in this harsh world. As in season one, season two’s cast follows a wide range of personalities, and each one is flawed in their own unique ways. They’re all capable of great acts of kindness as well as sweeping acts of betrayal--just like, you know, real humans are.\n\nUnlike season one, season two completely sheds its extraneous adventure game roots. It doesn’t bog itself down pointless puzzles or fetch quests (people who remember finding batteries for a certain radio know exactly what I’m talking about). Rather, season two is constantly about forward momentum, as it propels you from one bleak scenario to the next. For the most part, this works in its favor--and whether you’re running from zombies or enjoying a brief respite, every moment feels deliberate. It really is a roller coaster ride of emotions (mostly depression), and Telltale has nailed the art of the cliffhanger in this series.\n\nThat said, season two’s pacing feels off. Major plot points are wrapped up by episode three, leaving the back half of the game to languish in this weird survival purgatory. There’s no real endgame--merely survival--and the last two episodes drift along aimlessly until the season's ultimate conclusion. The payoff is certainly worth it, as its exploration of the evils any of its characters are capable of finally comes to a head--I just wish it didn’t take so long to get there. Even with these pacing issues, season two is still worth playing, as there are some truly surprising moments that will make even the most hardened player reel in shock.\n\nSeason two also keeps its signature quick-time events intact, and if you hated them in season one, you’re going to hate them here, too. When you’re not navigating The Walking Dead’s myriad life-ruining decisions, you’re mashing buttons or matching on-screen directional prompts to avoid bandits or shambling zombies. Like the plot, these QTEs certainly feel like you’re doing something, and they definitely spice up the action, but they occur far too frequently, and your input is way too basic to be anything more than contrivance at best, and the red arrows have a tendency to blend in with all the action on screen, leading to more than a few frustrating restarts.\n\nEven with its hiccups, season two of The Walking Dead is absolutely worth playing, with an interesting cast of characters and a narrative that is still sufficiently gripping despite its less interesting parts. It’s not quite game of the year material, and it doesn’t feel as necessary as season one, but Telltale proves that Clementine’s story is one well worth continuing.","December 5, 2015","true","89.4"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

Unfortunately, this one comes nowhere close to it.  It is no longer an adventure game meant to cause the player to reflect on how their values hold up when pushed to the limits (a stressful post-apocalyptic setting where ideals are never realized).  Instead, it is a 3D virtual novel with very little agency at all.  It was very rare that Lee ever did anything that directly conflicted with my agency.  However, Clementine's options never seem to fit how I want to react, and many situations are not only uninteresting, but simply convenient writing.\n\nAlso, although this is not an inherently negative aspect, each episode takes substantially less time to complete than the previous game, so on top of being unsatisfied with the content, I'm also getting less of it to judge it on.  Unfortunately, I regret my purchase quite a bit.  I don't feel down that I'm out $20; I'll gladly add that to them as extra payment for how great the first game was.  Instead, I feel cheated on the time I invested into the game.

Choices you make during S2 are not determinant until the last minutes of EP5, and that's a shame because this gives you too little REAL decisional power, but it was nice to have a so hectic and variable ending. Now I'm curious to see what will happen in Season 3 and if the main character will change again.\n\nThere are also some plot holes here and there, things happen without explanations, some questions are left there without a real answer. I also found some new charaters to be really interesting and well built, others instead barely newsworthy. And well, sometimes Clementine is appointed with decisions and tasks too heavy for a small girl like her, not realistic and a bit forced by script and gameplay reasons, but fun nonetheless!\n\nI liked Season 2, I recommend it to everyone who loved Season 1, however you need to know and like Telltale narrative and graphical style, so if you never played TWD or The Wolf Among Us, start from there before buying this one.","August 27, 2014","true","11.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/snowmanslick/recommended/261030/","snowmanslick","snowman slick","http://steamcommunity.com/id/snowmanslick/","282 products in account","Better than the first season in a lot of ways. There is a wider and more diverse cast of characters, and, although Telltale still relies heavily on the "false" choices where outcomes are the same regardless of your input, many of the choices feel more impactful. I was surprised several times thoughout as to how much my choice changed the outcome of several key events, and the ending to the season has an increadible amount of versatility. Most of the puzzle mechanics from the first game are gone. Where they are used, they mostly fit in well in the context of the narrative and serve as a tool to help you connect with the characters of the game.\n\nLike the first game, the story focuses strongly on themes of family, trust, and togetherness. It goes deeper than the first in investigating how people handle greif as a result of loss, and shows how the different coping mechanisms employed by different characters affect their actions and outlooks on the situation at hand. It explores how, sometimes, hard choices between the safety of the individual, group, and self must be made, and how the effects of those choices will often hurt people you never intended to hurt. There is one character who serves as the main antagonist to the second episode who shows how focusing too much on any one of these, even with initially good intentions, can lead to monstrous acts.\n\nI was a bit skeptical about the choice of pre-teen Clementine as the protagonist because it seems in the first game many of her thoughts were disregarded by the group due to her age, but it works better than I expected. There are times when that happens, but there also times when she proves herself mentally-stronger and more capable than many of the others in the group.\n\nFurther, it feels like it's easier to role-play a wider variety of personalities for Clementine, as opposed to the options available for Lee in first game. I tried to play her as a moderate character whoes main goal is to keep the group together, but there are options to play something closer to a lonesome survivor, a child who focuses on her safety, or an opertunist who focuses on sticking with the most capable in her group while avoiding everyone else.\n\nAt times, it felt more like I was watching a film than playing a video game. Not to say there isn't a lot of interactivity in the game. I can't recall any section where I felt things dragging on too long without me getting any input. That said, I never felt challenged in terms of either my skill at manipulating the mechanics, or in my ability to logically work through a problem. More than anything else, the most difficult challenges the game presents are all ideological. There are several scenarios where, even given that everything Clementine does goes perfectly (which it doesn't always), there is no good obvious answer as to what you should do, and the only way forward will result in someone you like getting hurt.\n\nAll-in-all, a very good game. I'd recommend this to anyone interested in heavily story-driven games with a role-playing focus (that's role-playing in the sense that you make choices for a character, not in the sense that you have stats to level up).","November 29, 2014","true","12.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

But it's not too far off either. Season 2 follows up from Season 1 (woohoo for imported saves), though sadly 400 days seems like it was a waste of time after all. I want to say there is less action this time around, but that wouldn't really be true. Rather its that the change from playing as Lee Everett to Clementine that results in less fights for the player to get involved in directly, which is kinda neat in its own way. 10 year old girls aren't expected to do as much melee stuff as a 37 year old man would, though you still do some of that here.\n\nThere's also less adventure game style puzzles to do... alot less. Most of the gameplay here is dialogue choices and relatively brief action sequences, which almost puts this game into visual novel territory. It's a shame because there are far fewer opportunities for wandering around just chatting or interacting with the environment, which weakens the character development a bit for the new faces that don't get much time. It means that Season 2's episodes are generally shorter, but it also means that you spend less time wandering about and more time following the plot. A plot that is still quite good, though perhaps not as likely to bring people to tears as some of the bigger moments of Season 1 did. Nothing in Season 2 got that to happen for me, though the finale came close as you find yourself making rough choices that can give you very different endings (unlike Season 1, which ended the same way no matter what).\n\nI'd say the high points of the season are found in Episodes 2 and 5 (which are also the longest episodes), with the other episodes mainly serving as build-up towards those bigger moments. I'm not sure where this series will go from here, but it seems very likely that we will see a Season 3. Whether that is with who ultimately makes it out of Season 2 or not (which has to consolidate the varied endings for this season), or if it is an entirely new cast, is uncertain. Until we find out... enjoy this one. It's pretty good. :)","August 26, 2014","true","33.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

But it's not too far off either. Season 2 follows up from Season 1 (woohoo for imported saves), though sadly 400 days seems like it was a waste of time after all. I want to say there is less action this time around, but that wouldn't really be true. Rather its that the change from playing as Lee Everett to Clementine that results in less fights for the player to get involved in directly, which is kinda neat in its own way. 10 year old girls aren't expected to do as much melee stuff as a 37 year old man would, though you still do some of that here.\n\nThere's also less adventure game style puzzles to do... alot less. Most of the gameplay here is dialogue choices and relatively brief action sequences, which almost puts this game into visual novel territory. It's a shame because there are far fewer opportunities for wandering around just chatting or interacting with the environment, which weakens the character development a bit for the new faces that don't get much time. It means that Season 2's episodes are generally shorter, but it also means that you spend less time wandering about and more time following the plot. A plot that is still quite good, though perhaps not as likely to bring people to tears as some of the bigger moments of Season 1 did. Nothing in Season 2 got that to happen for me, though the finale came close as you find yourself making rough choices that can give you very different endings (unlike Season 1, which ended the same way no matter what).\n\nI'd say the high points of the season are found in Episodes 2 and 5 (which are also the longest episodes), with the other episodes mainly serving as build-up towards those bigger moments. I'm not sure where this series will go from here, but it seems very likely that we will see a Season 3. Whether that is with who ultimately makes it out of Season 2 or not (which has to consolidate the varied endings for this season), or if it is an entirely new cast, is uncertain. Until we find out... enjoy this one. It's pretty good. :)","August 26, 2014","true","33.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

As for the story, it seems to be focused more on survival and just making it "from one day to another", but there's still place for emotions. Just not as much of them as the first game had. I think I've enjoyed season one a bit more, but if you've liked the previous season I don't see a reason why wouldn't you like season 2. The only flaw is, again, the fact that our choices don't affect the big picture most of the times. Oh, and the graphics improved some. I'm not a guy who cares much for grahpics, but they've done a great job with shading. As for the fact that we're playing as a child now... This didn't affect my experience, really. As in, gameplay-wise it's all the same... Story wise, of course people treat Clementine different than they've treated Lee.

Yes, they're zombie games and those have been done to hell and back, but never one that has been done this well. These games manage to rip and tear at every conceivable emotion available to the player.\n\nMuch like many of Telltale's games these are separated into episodes and once you start an episode, it's hard to quit playing. These aren't your typical games however. They're more or less a choose your own adventure TV series. The game has a very simplistic UI and control scheme. Moving the mouse around will highlight areas of interest and you simply click once to interact with it. Action sequences are essentially quick time events and the only way to die is to fail these segments.\n\nThe beauty of the game is in the storytelling and how your decisions have an impact in later episodes. Many times throughout the series I found myself making some very heated decisions based on the feelings that the game evoked and I had to live with those choices. The game does a trememdous job of making you question if you made the right decision. I've actually lied awake at night on a couple occasions really regretting what I had done.\n\nIf you're not the type to care about storytelling, this isn't going to be the game for you. There's not enough substance in the core gameplay that would be appealing to someone that doesn't play games to follow a story. If that hasn't turned you away yet, the game does suffer some minor narrative issues. There are decisions you can make that really don't carry any weight, encountered more often in season 2, and ultimately the game moves along as scheduled.\n\nTL;DR\nIf you enjoy good narrative based games, these would be hard games to pass up. The storytelling and your ability to react to the story are outstanding.","July 25, 2014","true","9.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Check out Youtube playthroughs to determine whether or not this is a game for you.\n\nThe Gameplay:\nThe Gameplay for The Walking Dead is the same as all Telltale games, it's designed really to be an interactive story more than a game, you push buttons that prompt your character to use different dialogues which determine many different things in which the character react to you, think about you & what they'll do for you & solve puzzles in order to progress further in the story.\n\nIt's an interactive movie really you watch the game unfold while giving it mild plot changes during gameplay with the occasional Quick Time event that determines whether you die or not.\n\nThe Verdict:\nThe Walking Dead: Season 2 is a game that is not for everyone but it's certainly an experience for people who love a solid story or if you're a fan of The Walking Dead comics or TV series, or even if you're just a Zombie fan.\n\nWhile this game has a very solid story & it's great to go through and try different things on other playthoughs it really just shines brilliance when you take the time to get to know each character and determine which characters you would want on your side in a real apocolypse scenario.\n\nWhile the gameplay is pretty much just Quick Time Events it's 1 of those games where it works because it's not designed to really make you work, unlike a Third Person or First Person game you are playing a game in this you're watching & creating a story.\n\nThis game also receives a 10/10 along with the first game because they're just so damn good. It is everything i expected for this series and nothing let me down.\n\nIt would have been nice to feel like some of my decisions really made a difference but it doesn't really matter all that much because the game is set on a very straight story that can't really be branched because of it's close steps towards the comic book narritive.\n\nDo I Recommend This Game?:\nYes i do recommend it and it's well worth a play as i said throughout my whole review.\n\nIf You Haven't Played Season 1:\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/207610/\n\nOther Games Similar You Might Like:\n\nThe Wolf Among Us:\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/250320/\n\nJurrasic Park:\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/201830/\n\nOr you can just check out the whole catalogue of Telltale games as they're all very similar:\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/publisher/Telltale%20Games\n\nCheck Out My Review For Season 1:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/Paddles01/recommended/207610/","August 27, 2014","true","8.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

Up until now i have played 2 episodes and there was already so much action, drama, tear-jerking and hilarious moments, it's impossible to sum it all up in one review.\n\nAll I can say is that the story is intense and way darker than in the first season in my opinion, the gameplay is fluent and there are lots of different choices you can make that have an impact on the ending you'll get (to my knowledge there are 5-6 different ending this time) so the replayabilty is probably higher than in the first installment.\n\nBut yeah, as I said: If you have enjoyed the first installment, you'll love this one. There are new characters, you'll eventually meet folks you know from the first season and all of them play a valid role. Sure, the gameplay mostly consists of dialogue, but the story keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time. Believe me, if there is a stressfull situation in the game, it's not only Clem who's gonna be stressed out, it'll affect yourself, as well.\n\nFor me, this game is a straight 10/10 and my personal Game of the Year so far.\n\nEdit: And I almost forgot: I, personally, already loved Clementine in the first season, but in this one she is a straight up badass.

The controls are less confusing and you get to play through Clementines eyes. This little girl is growing up so fast, she has been through hell and back and it's time for her to make the choices. It has a nice story but it's not as great as the first season and how it drags you in so deeply. Regardless, if you're a fan of the other season then you have to play this one too, and the others to come.

When you’re not navigating The Walking Dead’s myriad life-ruining decisions, you’re mashing buttons or matching on-screen directional prompts to avoid bandits or shambling zombies. Like the plot, these QTEs certainly feel like you’re doing something, and they definitely spice up the action, but they occur far too frequently, and your input is way too basic to be anything more than contrivance at best, and the red arrows have a tendency to blend in with all the action on screen, leading to more than a few frustrating restarts.\n\nEven with its hiccups, season two of The Walking Dead is absolutely worth playing, with an interesting cast of characters and a narrative that is still sufficiently gripping despite its less interesting parts. It’s not quite game of the year material, and it doesn’t feel as necessary as season one, but Telltale proves that Clementine’s story is one well worth continuing.\n","July 3, 2015","true","10.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","3","3","2","2"

This game was not spoiled for me like the first game; maybe I would have liked the first one better. I kept my word, and never trusted anyone. This was my goal for the game, don't trust hope and trust no one. The game has 4-5 endings, much better than only two like the first game had. I loved my ending, since I didn't follow hope, it was exactly what I wanted for an ending.\n\nThe beauty of the game is, you're a cute little girl, and no man is ever going to punch you. You can be a "c***" to anyone you wish and watch them contemplate hitting you.\n\nIn other words, if you like the first game, buy it. If you haven't played it, buy the first game.

Being created by Telltale and being based on a comic and TV series, it makes complete sense that the game is structured episodically (5 appears to be Telltale’s favorite episode number, the only time they strayed was Season 1 of Sam & Max) and belongs to the adventure genre, although not in the classical sense (aka mind-bending puzzles). This game is part of the new wave of adventure games in which the adventure is highly toned down and quick time events and quick decision making which heavily influence the plot rule. This new type of adventure game, clearly targeted at consoles as opposed to PCs, because consoles can’t Point ‘n Click (speaking of, Sony, isn’t it time you released Heavy Rain on the PC? I mean it’s been 4 years already, get over yourselves) is of course not intended as competition for oldschool-style adventures, but as an alternative to watching a movie (one episode has a movie running time).You can read the full review here[in2gpu.com].","August 29, 2014","true","0.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

It's not that the scene was especially graphic or tramatic or terrifying. No, it was the connection I felt to the character (Clem) and the situation she was going thru. It was just brutal to not only have to watch it, but to have to participate in forcing her to do what had to be done. Just brutally emotinal.\n\nAt the end of the day, any game that can make me care that much about one of the characters is easily worth the asking price. You won't find a better story in gaming than what's presented here and in Season 1. If you don't own this yet, you owe it to yourself to pick this up. And if you don't own the first season yet, what the hell are you waiting for? This game may be a little light on the gameplay, but it's big where it counts; an emotionally gripping story that will make you genuinely care about the characters in it. It's like the best TV show or movie you've ever seen, and you get to be a part of the action.\n\nCan't recommend this game enough.","January 18, 2014","true","2.0"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","4"

If you want the short version, they added/improved a lot of game mechanics, but the game only goes downhill from there. Keep reading if you want to know more.\n\nThe UI and other mechanics have been enhanced slightly, you no longer have to walk everywhere as there is now "fast-walking" which can be used by holding down shift.  Selecting dialouge options is easier, as well as the various actions you can perform on characters, they changed it all to cursor based so you can click on each option independently, instead of having to use the mouse wheel. Quick reaction times also got some love, as now in some cases you need to use WASD to move out of the way, but I wouldn't consider this a breakthrough or anything special, I'm just putting it out there on the table.\n\nNow that we've gone through the good, here comes the bad...the actual story and episodes. I really liked the first 2 episodes, the first most of all but after those two, everything just started to seem...I don't know...off? I can't really describe it, maybe it's just because in the first season I felt like I had more freedom, and as I went through the episodes it was like my freedom to make certain choices and my ability to move around freely just seemed to be near diminished. The last episode seemed to be the worst in terms of choice making. Why couldn't I just shoot Arvo? I wanted him dead for the longest time. Why did I have to choose between shooting Kenny and Jane? Kenny proved he was unstable, so I ended up offing him, then it turns out Jane was being just as big of a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ as Kenny was? Just to prove her point that he was unstable?? I applaud telltale for making a series as complex as this, but I would seriously prefer it if they take their time with the next season. I was honestly surprised when Episode 5 released when it did, just one month after Episode 4, I expected it to take MUCH longer than that, and it probably should have.\n\nAnyhow, I will most likely be picking up Season 3, despite the slight dissapointment I obtained from playing this one. If Season 3 turns out to be very similar to this one, I don't think I'll be playing the series anymore.\n\nDo I still recommend the game? Yes, it's still an enjoyable title, it's just not as enjoyable and memorable as the first title.","August 26, 2014","true","23.6"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","1"

Its strongpoint is its dynamic storytelling and character development, which are tailored to player choice, not unlike role-playing games. This game creates characters better than most others, they feel more alive than any other game due to how responsive they are to your dialogue choices. Combined with the intensity of the plot, The Walking Dead is one of the easiest games to connect to, rivaled only by some of Bioware's RPGs. It's a definite must-have for any gamer, no matter how experienced you are. The Walking Dead is an interactive story, much better than the television show, and it's a fine demonstration of how good and personal video game storytelling can be.","April 23, 2014","true","9.4"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

The game outside these cutscenes takes the form of Point and Click, click on things, collect and click on more things but the game is so fun and the story is so interesting that this never gets boring.\n\nThe game runs better, a lot of new gameplay feautures have been added and the graphics have been given an amazing update from last year.\n\nYou HAVE to get this game if you played Season 1, don't end it there!\nAmazing so far and there's another 3 episodes still to come!","April 27, 2014","true","25.8"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","3"

Think of it as a mix between a Heavy Rain, Sam and Max, and of course, The Walking Dead. In this game your choices actually matter, they have an impact on what the rest of your game will be like, which is not something you see everyday. The cell shaded art style gives it a unique comic book feel, wish makes it stick to it's roots from The Walking Dead comic, which is nice, sometimes it can draw you away from the experience but overall it doesn't matter. Asides a few technical bugs, like characters disappearing and re-appearing, there is nothing that extremely catches your attention. The characters though, damn, playing as Clementine and choosing sides (or being neutral) between different characters throughout the game builds more of a relationship, and brings you more in-depth with how people are affected by the apocalypse. This is great so far, you'll see when you play it for yourself. which you sure as hell should do.","February 10, 2014","true","21.4"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

There's no real goal in this season, just stuff happening and you're a passenger. The whole "playing as a child" idea sounds neat a first, but soon just makes you all the more aware of how little your choices mean in these games. The story tells itself, and your minor changes ultimately mean nothing. This gets even worse at a definite point in Episode 5 when it just takes the controls away from you and decides "It's story time now, you don't even get the illusion of choice."\n\nAny time you save one character from death, you just watch them as they silently carry on with their inevitably short lives. There was a chance for them to die, so for the script's purposes, they're dead. They're still hanging around, but they serve no purpose and are just walking targets, waiting for a piano to fall from the sky and crush them.\n\nNot to mention (spoilers) after Episode 2 it just turns into the Kenny show so you get to spend the next 3 and a half episodes watching him be an unbearable ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ while he ignores anything you say to him.\n\nIt's just a roller coaster of unlikeable characters, extremely predictable actions, and a script that doesn't seem to have any desire to do anthing interesting. Honestly "roller coaster" is a way too exciting way of describing it. Just quit with Season 1 and enjoy that without souring the whole experience with this horrid cash in on the concept.","August 26, 2014","false","8.9"," 75 of 145 people (52%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","52","75","145","3","4"

Clem works well as a protagonist and will like to help shape her as she is growing older. However, the dynamic narrative that worked so well between Lee and Clem in the first season is lacking and never made up for.\n\nThe basic problem of the season is the lack of purpose. You don't have a major goal really at any time, you don't feel like there's a natural flow and so all the little events, personal drama, human loss and so on end up feeling meaningless. The other characters are either unbelievable (so stupid?) or just never fully developed before they disappear and this is in big contrast to Season 1.\n\nSo as I said, It's definitely worth playing but not nearly as good as the first (7/10).","October 27, 2014","true","17.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Clem is still no more than ten years old, and the way that potentially changes how the player will interact with the world in this season is exciting. For her age, Clementine is certainly quite clever and strong, but the world of The Walking Dead is full of monsters, zombie and otherwise, and there's no question she's more vulnerable and less powerful than Lee was. One of the challenges of this is balancing between giving the player agency in the world without giving Clem influence she shouldn't have from a narrative point of view. This is going to have to be a very different story, and with the setup, it's somewhat hard to see how it will pay off the way the first season did, but we'll have to wait and find out.\nIn terms of gameplay, very little has changed from the first season. Most of the important interaction comes from dialogue choices, with QTEs and a few simple fetch quests tossed in to break things up. Like in the original, you will sometimes have to make some tough choices, and the game will keep track of how you choose, leading to slightly different situations. I sometimes miss the more difficult puzzles found in Telltale's earlier titles such as Tales of Monkey Island, but their more recent games seem to be going for a different type of genre, so it's probably best not to make direct comparisons. This is less an adventure game and more of a visual novel, albeit one that does a very good job of keeping the player within the lines while simultaneously making them feel like the story is their own. Perhaps things will change up in later episodes, but I don't really think they have to if the main concept is pulled off properly.\nscreen1136x1136-9\nFrom a technical standpoint, well, this is an iOS version of a Telltale game, so things aren't going to be completely airtight. In particular, I should give a clear warning to people on older hardware. If your hardware was not officially supported but could run the first season in some fashion anyway, don't count on the same here. Things went pretty smoothly on my iPhone 5S, but I've seen tons of complaints from people on circa-iPhone 4 tech. Given Telltale's history, don't count on much technical support after the fact, either. One thing that did work quite well is the save game import. As long as you kept the first season on your device, you'll be able to import your final data for that. There aren't many ramifications in the first episode apart from the "Previously" opening, but I'm sure things will come into play in less subtle ways eventually.\nFrom here, I'll write up a bit about each episode as they're released. As with the main review, I'll do my best to avoid spoiling anything current when talking about each one, but there may be spoilers for prior episodes as we go along.

Episode 1 and 2 are fairly bland and forgetable, but things start to pick up again when the character of Kenny is reintroduced and the stakes slowly build up. It never really finds the narrative flow that the first season seemed to have from the get go, but the last episodes (particularly Episode 5) have very memorable moments nonetheless.\n\nAs always, your choices in the game don't actually matter. You might save someone's life at one point, but that just marks that character for an unavoidable death somewhere down the line. A lot of the drama in episodes 2-4 rely on you caring about characters who are doing their damn best to remove themselves from the gene pool, but the sure knowledge that everyone you save is going to die anyhow at some point sort of minimizes that point.\n\nAnother problem with the choices is that they never seem to negatively effect you. In season 1 there were moments where a wrong choice actually got you killed (like telling that lady to put her ♥♥♥♥ing gun down in ep 2 of season 1 for instance), but that never happened in season 2 so after a while I felt pretty immortal. And that removed something too.\n\nBy the time they get to Episode 5 though, the writers figure out the kinks and kick things into high gear. It's an absolutely stellar finale. But the fact it took them that long to get to that point is kind of a shame, considering how much waffling the game did in the middle episodes.\n\nStill, can't say I don't recommend it, in spite of the flaws. God bless Kenny.\n\nMaybe season 3 will have an older Clementine.","August 26, 2014","true","9.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Clem works well as a protagonist and will like to help shape her as she is growing older. However, the dynamic narrative that worked so well between Lee and Clem in the first season is lacking and never made up for.\n\nThe basic problem of the season is the lack of purpose. You don't have a major goal really at any time, you don't feel like there's a natural flow and so all the little events, personal drama, human loss and so on end up feeling meaningless. The other characters are either unbelievable (so stupid?) or just never fully developed before they disappear and this is in big contrast to Season 1.\n\nSo as I said, It's definitely worth playing but not nearly as good as the first (7/10).","October 27, 2014","true","17.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I get your pain.\n\nRobert Kirkman is a man of entertainment and many talents. And he's a kinda a guy you would give Oscar to or slap so hard.\n\nWell, judging by franchise decisions for "The Walking Dead", Kirkman's should be greatly awarded AND punched in the face even harder. The guy, alongside his collagues gave us AWESOME COMICS, pretty solid novels, some great games and probably the ♥♥♥♥♥iest zombie show that ever stumbled on our screens. Yes, I am talking about AMC's The Walking Dead and I ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ HATE IT. In case you need to ask why, you either don't know what "The Walking Dead" is all about, or you're ignorant and you should be slapped, too.\n\nNow, let's get back to episodic adventure game "The Walking Dead" that's published by Telltale Games. In 2012 we got Season One, consisting of five episodes, and now we're stuck in the middle of Season 2, with Episode 4 on the way, biting our nails and hailing a great villain Bill Carver voiced by one and only Michael Madsen.\n\nIn case you haven't tried The Walking Dead before, it's an episodic not-really-adventure-but-more-of-a-interactive-novel game that puts you in position of choosing dialogues and actions which will directly influence the story - yes, it's a game that requires less reflexes than any other zombie game. Without need to dissect the Season 1 here, I'll skip to Season 2 right away.\n\nSeason 2 leans even more toward storytelling mode. It's a story driven season that will require even less actions, movements, but the decisions shall be huge and will leave you wanting more. As for the characters, Clem is back and she's back in black, you're gonna love her 'new' character. You'll meet some ol' friends and enemies, and if you have your Season 1 and 400 Days saves - the game will continue directly based upon your choices in previous Telltale TWD games.\n\nCharacters are portrayed pretty nicely, most of 'em are not flat and you'll have your own satisfaction or disappointment with their destinies and what you choose for them, and that thing is pretty important when it comes to games that are story and emotions driven.\n\nThe Walking Dead Season 2 needs some more action, but it gets you pretty pumped up with a story and therefore, I can't really complain. It's violent and hectic and if you love the world of TWD comics - this, in a pretty good way, comes pretty close.\n\nEither way, you have to be ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ crazy not to acknowledge the following - AMC's should seek game producers to work for their show, because this is WAY BETTER than that lame a$$ stuff served for fourth year now. If you've played Season 1 - get it. If you did not - get Season 1 first.","June 7, 2014","true","9.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Again, it has it's own style of graphics that belong to the game itself, and the story line completely showed up season one. I have to admit, the ending was really stupid, with the whole Kenny thing but i understand that it was just setting up the story for the next game.\n\nCarrying on with the negative points, the protagonist of this story is around eleven, yet manages to outlive countless grown ups, including murderers who have killed people before (Lee). This was, in many places a point - and - click game, but it was very fun and fast paced whilst it was at it, so i'll let that one off.\n\nUltimately, I love the theme of corruption, with Clem trying to keep everyone together throught the story, whilst trying to make every one happy, and, alive. I can gaurantee that this game will make you laugh, and possibly cry thanks to the brilliantly made story line.","October 26, 2014","true","16.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","4"

This season focuses on Clementine and how much she has grown up since the events of season one. She has witnessed some truly horrific events and it has changed her as a person. She is no longer the sweet little girl from the first season. She is willing to do whatever it takes to keep her and her loved ones alive. You meet a lot of new characters that you aren't sure if you will care about them or not. But as you get farther in, you get to know the characters better and you either fall in love with them or hate them. You still choose how the story plays off and some decisions will affect you in later on episodes. There were some very crucial decisions that I don't know if I could even make if I were in Clementine's shoes. Once again the writing and acting is top notch and never failed to entertain me. I was at tears at the end of the last episode and thought the ending had as much as a powerful impact as the first season did. There was a even a moment that made me cringe and it made it even better because it showed how hard it is to do things on your own. One thing I would take off for this season would be that I felt that some of the characters were wasted. I felt that they had more potential/development but suddenly they were just dead. Also, for most things when you make a decision, you basically get the same result if you were to make a different choice. But overall, The Walking Dead Season Two was an awesome experience and I will play it again sometime soon. If you still haven't bought this game, what are you waiting for? Stop reading this really long review and buy it!\n\n\n\n9/10\n\n+ Clementine's Story is amazing.\n+ Crucial decisions leave you thinking.\n+ Writing and acting is excellent.\n+ Has a very high emotional impact.\n+ Masterful last episode.\n- Some characters were wasted.\n- Diverse choices lead to same results.","August 26, 2014","true","8.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Season 2 does not live up to the impression Season 1 left on me, and, as a whole, I think I liked the season 2 cast more. But it doesn't matter, in the end.\n\nWe complain about our choices not mattering in Season 1, because no matter what you do, everything converges onto one point by Episode 5 - Omid and Christa make it out of Savannah, and Lee sacrifices himself for Clementine. But never have I had so many of my choices invalidated in one episode than in Season 2. Having just played Episode 4 - nothing I did mattered that episode. None of my choices. Major characters dying without speaking lines, major characters dying in the most bogus ways possible, yet Telltale still tries to pass it off as shock factor.\n\nAnd at this point? It's not. I played Season 1, and I know it's the zombie apocalypse and that people are going to die. Maybe that's meta gaming, but it's going into the game knowing exactly what I bought. I bought the game for the cast I knew I'd eventually come to love. The cast I knew I was going to die, but I knew I'd do my best to keep them alive. The cast I wanted to get to know, the stories of the survivors I wanted to hear. We get... almost none of that, here. In Episode 4, we get more about one character's backstory (whom we met in the previous episode) shoehorned into 90 minutes of gameplay than we have any of the other characters we've spent the rest of the season with. Only for that character to bow out, because she 'doesn't want to see Clem fall.' Ridiculous.\n\nThe writing is good, when it wants to be. When it needs to be, it falls flat. Characters completely change their personalities between episodes without us knowing why or seeing how - because they're off screen 75% of the time. There are significantly less hubs in Season 2 than there were in Season 1, meaning you barely get to talk to these characters when they are on screen. And when you do get to talk to them, you get one line, one subject, then it's done. But yeah, the story is still as emotional, but now I don't know if I'm crying at a character's death because I'm genuinely sad they're dead - or because I'm disappointed at the loss of potential.\n\nAt the time of this review, the day of Episode 4's release, I can say I'm not excited for Episode 5 at all.

Although sometimes it can surprise you what conversational choice says what.\n\nA quick mention for the gameplay, Season 1 veterans will instantly recognise the difference in how the game plays out, While Lee wasn't as big as other characters in the games, he was most certainly a powerhouse, often pulling together amazing feats of strength for a Teacher. Clementine plays differently however, she's small, light and nimble, dodging takes center stage in Season 2 as Clem's main winning move.\n\nNew characters will be introduced and just like Clem, they don't trust anyone any more. (STILL... NOT... BIT!)\nThese new characters are likeable and some new favourites of mine popped up in Season 2.\n\nThe production value of Season 2 also feels higher, Season 1 feels very much like a low cost game, and often feels more bland in it's low points than Season 2. However my favourite moments, still come from Season 1 (one of them is named above in the spoiler section)\n\nSeason 2's finale doesn't feel as high impact as Season 1's which makes me hope that Season 3 is quickly on the way to pick up the excitement.\n\nSeason 2 is an excellent step in the Walking Dead series, I recommend both Season 1 and 2 to any one that has not yet purchased them.\n\n8.5/10\n\n","August 26, 2014","true","10.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Yeah, i kinda missed playing as Lee, but playing as Clementine and seeing how much she has matured from the first season is awesome, and it's awesome playing as her. This Season has as much tear jerking scenes as the first one, and if there isn't the same amount, then it is more tear jerking.\n\nIn my Opinion, the Season started off a little bit slow, but every episode got better and better, then Episode 5 comes out and just blows me away. If you have not played the first season, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND playing it before this season, so you develop the relationship with Clementine and other Characters. Some Characters that are in the first season are back in this season, so prepare your ♥♥♥♥ for some tears.\n\nIf you don't have this game, it is a must buy, even if you aren't a fan of the TV series, chances are you will still fall in the love with this game. This is a game about building relationships with the characters and storyline, if you just like running and gunning games like Call of Duty, then this game isn't for you, but if you do love storylines and building relationships with characters, then this game is for you.\n\nI'd give this game a perfect 10/10, the ending had me in more tears than the first one, and i can tell you, ♥♥♥♥ hits the fan in Episode 5. Last thing is last, if you read this full review, thank you for taking your time to read this entire thing, you are awesome.","August 26, 2014","true","16.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bigandsexy/recommended/261030/","bigandsexy","Big Sexy®","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bigandsexy/","185 products in account","Season 2 is not like Season 1. Let's get that out of the way now; the tone is much darker than the previous installment in the series, and much of this is due to the character whose eyes you see the world through. In Season 1, you play as Lee, a good man who made a huge mistake, who tries his best to protect his friends and, specifically, a little girl named Clementine. After an emotional roller coaster of a season, we have no idea who among the group survives, with the exception of Clementine, who has survived the ordeal of the finale to enter into a new and uncertain place. In Season 2, you ARE Clementine. During the whole of Season 2, you experience all the horrors of a world gone mad. However, there is no one to shield you from the darkness; despite still being a child, your Clementine has to experience the weight of adult decisions made in a nightmare world.\n\nSeason 2 is at times visceral, nihilistic, and genuinely painful to get through, especially if you developed any sort of affinity towards Clementine in the prior season. You'll meet all sorts of engaging characters, both old and new, but you'll often watch as they are quickly and brutally snuffed out, just another casualty in this constantly expanding hell on earth. The quicktime events compliment the narrative action well, though they feel more frequent and more urgent, as protecting Clementine from zombies suddenly becomes a direct survival experience. Rather than seeking to save someone from life as a member of the undead in a way that was so common in Season 1, you're often trying to save yourself from death while managing the fates of others.\n\nHere's a brief spoiler: everybody dies. This game does a great job of hammering home the futility of life in this particular narrative world, both in the grand scheme of things and in the eyes of others, but it manages to make most deaths hit hard until it finally numbs you to the sensation of watching the life leave another character's eyes. By the end of Episode 5, I felt somewhat hollow and broken, as I was no longer able to trust my naturally altruistic intuition. During these episodes, you are betrayed, lied to, and ultimately left staring into the abyss as friends fall around you. I went from trusting the group, always following the altruistic path of the "hero," to slowly descending into pure self-preservation, ignoring my previous instincts of group protection and "doing the right thing" for the sake of surviving.\n\nThis season's story is well-told, and though it has some occasional weak points (Too many of the events seem overly emotional on the brink of pure manipulation, when a less heavy-handed approach might have done), it is a fantastic tale that will affect you in ways the good literature should. I highly recommend it in all the ways I would recommend a good book, as this is not a video game in a traditional sense. If you're looking for an affecting, well-written story that will make you consider both your place in the world and the true disposition of your heart, give this one a try.","August 27, 2014","true","25.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The major issue I had with the orignal Walking Dead game is that a LOT of the choices for me felt very one sided, you could say a little black and white.\nSeason Two manages to really give you tough choices this time round, everything really does feel 50/50, characters aren't as really deemed "good" or "bad" the things they do in the world can really be taken differently depending on the person playing. I found myself a lot of the times really thinking "Should I really do this?" or "Is X maybe right?" and even after making the choice feeling that self doubt, wondering if I'd made the right choice.\nOverall, they've improved on the idea of what you do effects the story so much over each game, and it really does add to some replayability, since some decisions might mean certain events might not happen, or some people might not survive, it makes you want to know all the possible outcomes.\n\nThe story telling is just so well done in this series. Telltale just do such a good job sticking to the tone and feel of a universe while still being able to add their own touch to give it that unique flavour.\nThe Walking Dead comics have always been very character driven and about conflicting veiw points about how an average person can live in such a hellish world.\nTelltale stick to that formula perfectly, making very real and believable characters, some likeable and others... Not so likeable, but overall adding to the drama of the story, not one character (to me at least) felt super out of place, everything has a reason for being there and it all adds up for some interesting situations.\nThe team at Telltale really do need to be praised for all the work they've done. You can see a lot of thought and effort has really gone into making this game be as immersive as it can be. Oh and the voice acting is just as smooth as ever, so a big gold star for the actors, too.\n\nNow for the things that irked me in some places, which surprisingly isn't an awful lot; if anything they really are just nit-picks i'd like to see improved on in future games.\n\nThe puzzle solving elements really were lacking compaired to the original game. In Season One, there was a LOT of times where you had to figure out how to get out of sticky situation, ultimately deciding whether you walked away in one piece, or became a tasty Walker snack.\nIn Season 2 it tends to just either tell you what to do or give you the bare minimum of things to interact with in order to progress the story.\nI'm not asking for Sam and Max style "I'll combine two random things and place it on something I never would have thought to" style of puzzles. Just something to cut up the drama and make me think for a bit, whether it be to reflect on my latest actions or to simply enjoy absorbing the environment.\n\nMy last thing to really bug me is animation. Now I don't mean it looks bad, actually the oppiset, the art style is amazing, it sticks to the comic book really well. What more gets to me is sometimes how characters move or react, it can sometimes feel very stiff and robotic at times or even a little goofy the way certain characters are placed or the way they stand, It just seems a little unnatural to me.\nI would really love to see some more fluid movements in future games, possibly even a little motion capture thrown in.\nHell, If I have to pay a little extra for an even better experiance, I can live with not eating for a bit.\n\nFinal thoughts are really this is a unique game, it probably won't be to everyones tastes but for me it sits just right. I love interactive stories, and having the world change to my decisions makes it that something more special.\nIf you like good character driven stories filled with conflct and tears, well written and brilliantly acted, you should probably play this.\n\ntl;dr\n\nIs good game. You like interactive story, go buy this, maybe play original first though.","August 27, 2014","true","9.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

With that out of the way...\n\nSeason Two was even better than Season One, mainly because of the change of protagonist.  Not that there was anything wrong with Lee, but playing as an eleven-year-old girl is so much more interesting.  Clem is inherently and automatically so powerless in some situations, and yet incredibly powerful in ways you wouldn't expect.  That's one reason that makes this one of the more interesting narratives in all of gaming right now.

This time around, you play as Clementine, and the old protagonist has since past and it is time for her to move on.  I quickly joined on her adventure when I was given a Steam Card for Christmas (Thank you, Grandma! :D) and I went in as soon as possible, literally shaking with excitement!  The first episode, "All That Remains" takes off with a shocking start; and it doesn't get any better from there, as you play on, Clementine goes through all kinds of grusome and grim shist, and now that you are no longer protecting her as Lee Everett, Clementine must learn to take care of herself in a world where the living may be more monsterous than the dead.  If I have to find one bit of critique in this game, it is some of the choices: The choices were difficult to make, but they were a different kind of difficult: I wasn't torn between two choices; I knew which choice I was going to choose, but it really sucked making the choice.  Both of the choices suck, but one just happened to suck less than the other.  It leaves a bad taste in your mouth afterword.  I don't mind those kinds of choices, but those were most of the choices based in "All that Remains".  I want more decitions that leave me torn and questioning the choice that I made.\n\nAnyway, that was the review.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/musday/recommended/261030/","musday","tafkag","http://steamcommunity.com/id/musday/","133 products in account","SPOILERS\n\nShort Version: An exceedingly good game let down by a couple of tiny gripes for me. The characters aren't as accessible, and the story moves too fast, taking the grim, tense slog out of the post-apocalyptic world.\n\nThe Walking Dead Game: Season Two was a game I awaiting with my teeth buried into my knuckles in anticipation, staring at the calendar for each episode of the five-part season. Prior to playing I had some serious fears for the game, not least that it was following The Walking Dead Game: Season One, which was most probably my favourite game of 2012, so well done Telltale for that. Suffice it to say therefore that Season Two had some huge booties to fill. For me there are two things that prevent Season Two from achieving this. One is something that I can explain myself to an extent, but it nevertheless does bite at my immersion-loving ankles, the other is perhaps the most surprising qualm I've ever had with a game. Enough build up.\n\nProblem one. One of my favourite aspects of Season One was having a wealth of moments where your entire group was sat milling around by a broken-down train, or hiding out in a drug store. As Lee you could seize these moments of tranquillity and have a chat with all of your companions. Not only was there ample supply of these moments, but the conversations themselves were full of options so you could get to know your fellow man/woman/child/Ben. Having long, character defining conversations, where each character could say something to entirely change how you see them, for better or worse was one of the most engrossing things about Season One for me. It made each moment with them matter. They could reveal themselves to be a closet racist, or a snobbish elitist at heart, or they could show a depth of empathy and caring you'd not expected from them and never would have.\n\nHowever, in Season Two, these conversation moments are whittled down, instead with a heavier focus on story (more on that later). While this could not necessarily be a bad thing (more story, more value for money etc) it means that I never felt much for any of the characters. While every death in Season One struck me in some way, characters came and went in Season Two like cars on a motorway. At some points I barely had time to remember their names and 'poof', they were dead or split off or otherwise departed. This meant that even as far as Episode Five people could die and my reaction was the same as if I'd just watched them scratch their chin. Given that by the timescale of Season Two, the zombie apocalypse has been cracking on for a good year and then some, so perhaps this less talkative batch of people works; everyone's realised that getting to know people well isn't a worthwhile investment. But it still makes the game feel shallow to me (by comparison with Season One, it's still gloriously rich compared with most, don't get me wrong).\n\nThat's problem that I can explain myself. Problem two though is a baffler. Due to the lack of slow, conversational moments to regulate the pace of the story, Season Two barrels through what I could have happily seen spread over Season Two and Three really. Yup, too much plot! So much happens in such a short space of play-time that, even though your character has gone through more ordeals than you can shake a dismembered limb at, I still felt cheated at the end. I finished the finale (which is a gloriously heart-breaking set of decisions that caused me a have a very restless night's sleep, so applause for you again Telltale, I'd ruffle your hair were you here), and looking back over the game, felt like I'd played the Cliff Notes version of the story, rather than the full text. There was so much potential for character development and building some horrific tension and decision-making into Carver's community. I'd happily have stayed there and let characters evolve and come to terms/blows with the situation a lot more. But the story seemed to feel the need to charge headlong onwards. Exploring Carver's world could have been fantastic, but it's gone now. Shame.\n\nMy main gripe story wise was that it became suddenly very linear. I saw an opportunity with Carver in Episode Three. My Clementine was by that point a cold, logical, unshakable zombie/bandit annihilation machine, and I saw the opportunity to stick with Carver. You want to survive, you join the winning side. To hell with the broken people you started out with. Life is for those who can keep it. But I was funnelled into making a decision I didn't particularly want to make, and this probably soured much of Episode Four for me.\n\nHowever those are just two small(ish) issues that, because I'm a whiny git, I'm blowing out of proportion. The Walking Dead Game: Season Two is a fantastically made game, which slicker graphics, faster paced action and drama, and the same tough decisions, which ACTUALLY HAVE AN EFFECT on the outcome this time. I'm perhaps overly critical on what I'd consider issues that spoilt what would have definitely been my favourite game of 2014. If it had stayed a little truer to Season One, with a batch of characters I could get to know, it would have been a marvel of just how phenomenal a game could be. Instead, it's just very, very good. Given what it could have been, being an 8/9 out of 10 game is somehow a disappointment.\n","August 29, 2014","true","11.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bigandsexy/recommended/261030/","bigandsexy","Big Sexy®","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bigandsexy/","185 products in account","Season 2 is not like Season 1. Let's get that out of the way now; the tone is much darker than the previous installment in the series, and much of this is due to the character whose eyes you see the world through. In Season 1, you play as Lee, a good man who made a huge mistake, who tries his best to protect his friends and, specifically, a little girl named Clementine. After an emotional roller coaster of a season, we have no idea who among the group survives, with the exception of Clementine, who has survived the ordeal of the finale to enter into a new and uncertain place. In Season 2, you ARE Clementine. During the whole of Season 2, you experience all the horrors of a world gone mad. However, there is no one to shield you from the darkness; despite still being a child, your Clementine has to experience the weight of adult decisions made in a nightmare world.\n\nSeason 2 is at times visceral, nihilistic, and genuinely painful to get through, especially if you developed any sort of affinity towards Clementine in the prior season. You'll meet all sorts of engaging characters, both old and new, but you'll often watch as they are quickly and brutally snuffed out, just another casualty in this constantly expanding hell on earth. The quicktime events compliment the narrative action well, though they feel more frequent and more urgent, as protecting Clementine from zombies suddenly becomes a direct survival experience. Rather than seeking to save someone from life as a member of the undead in a way that was so common in Season 1, you're often trying to save yourself from death while managing the fates of others.\n\nHere's a brief spoiler: everybody dies. This game does a great job of hammering home the futility of life in this particular narrative world, both in the grand scheme of things and in the eyes of others, but it manages to make most deaths hit hard until it finally numbs you to the sensation of watching the life leave another character's eyes. By the end of Episode 5, I felt somewhat hollow and broken, as I was no longer able to trust my naturally altruistic intuition. During these episodes, you are betrayed, lied to, and ultimately left staring into the abyss as friends fall around you. I went from trusting the group, always following the altruistic path of the "hero," to slowly descending into pure self-preservation, ignoring my previous instincts of group protection and "doing the right thing" for the sake of surviving.\n\nThis season's story is well-told, and though it has some occasional weak points (Too many of the events seem overly emotional on the brink of pure manipulation, when a less heavy-handed approach might have done), it is a fantastic tale that will affect you in ways the good literature should. I highly recommend it in all the ways I would recommend a good book, as this is not a video game in a traditional sense. If you're looking for an affecting, well-written story that will make you consider both your place in the world and the true disposition of your heart, give this one a try.","August 27, 2014","true","25.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

However, they need to experience it for themselves - sure, at times the choices don't seem to matter a great deal regarding outcome, but the thing that makes the choices great is just how hard they are to make. You can tell just by the other players' choices at the end of each episode just how brilliant they are because the majority of the choices are split pretty close to 50/50 - getting close to that with every episode as the choices become harder and harder to make.\n\nThis is an immervise and dramatic interactive experience, there isn't a whole lot of gameplay in the traditional sense, there's some small areas to look around in at times, there's a lot of dialogue to choose and there are a few quick time events - but overall not a whole lot. I don't think this makes it a bad thing, it works, it's enough to make you feel like you're there.\n\nFor those of you who think that the choices don't matter, this game is a lot better than the first for choices. Not only are most of the choices harder, but they also do change things more. For example, a choice in the first episode makes the first 20 or so minutes of the second episode completely different. More people can survive depending on your choices, it isn't just a choose one or the other thing this time around. Also, the biggest thing of all is that there are multiple different endings to the season, all brilliant in their own right - not just one like the first game.\n\nPlease play this game if you care about storytelling in video games, because this is one of the finest games for that.","August 28, 2014","true","9.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Not in a bad way though, the relationship you have with clem whilst you play as lee is trully amazing and one of the best in gaming which is why to top the first season would have taken a miracle. This season does however do a really great job of making you feel helpless in a very bleak and dark world, which is good since you play as a little girl. The episodes are all done well and are constantly great throughout, and the 5th episode is brilliant in every way and rivals that of the first seasons. The way the game ends as well makes season 3 look like it will really be different and alot more personnel for everyone which is fantastic, becuase i would love my choices to make a much greater impact on the story in both seasons. Unfortunately things can be a bit stupid sometimes e.g. everyone relying on a little girl to do everything, at one point you as clem are forced to kick open a door whilst a women just stands next to you. Also one or two choices are poorly done and the outcome kinda feels cheap, although this really is only one or two choices. In basic though if you loved the first season then you will surely love this and now that all the episodes are out you wont have to wait whilst telltale screw around with the realease dates.","August 30, 2014","true","12.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Clem is still no more than ten years old, and the way that potentially changes how the player will interact with the world in this season is exciting. For her age, Clementine is certainly quite clever and strong, but the world of The Walking Dead is full of monsters, zombie and otherwise, and there's no question she's more vulnerable and less powerful than Lee was. One of the challenges of this is balancing between giving the player agency in the world without giving Clem influence she shouldn't have from a narrative point of view. This is going to have to be a very different story, and with the setup, it's somewhat hard to see how it will pay off the way the first season did, but we'll have to wait and find out.\nIn terms of gameplay, very little has changed from the first season. Most of the important interaction comes from dialogue choices, with QTEs and a few simple fetch quests tossed in to break things up. Like in the original, you will sometimes have to make some tough choices, and the game will keep track of how you choose, leading to slightly different situations. I sometimes miss the more difficult puzzles found in Telltale's earlier titles such as Tales of Monkey Island, but their more recent games seem to be going for a different type of genre, so it's probably best not to make direct comparisons. This is less an adventure game and more of a visual novel, albeit one that does a very good job of keeping the player within the lines while simultaneously making them feel like the story is their own. Perhaps things will change up in later episodes, but I don't really think they have to if the main concept is pulled off properly.\nscreen1136x1136-9\nFrom a technical standpoint, well, this is an iOS version of a Telltale game, so things aren't going to be completely airtight. In particular, I should give a clear warning to people on older hardware. If your hardware was not officially supported but could run the first season in some fashion anyway, don't count on the same here. Things went pretty smoothly on my iPhone 5S, but I've seen tons of complaints from people on circa-iPhone 4 tech. Given Telltale's history, don't count on much technical support after the fact, either. One thing that did work quite well is the save game import. As long as you kept the first season on your device, you'll be able to import your final data for that. There aren't many ramifications in the first episode apart from the "Previously" opening, but I'm sure things will come into play in less subtle ways eventually.\nFrom here, I'll write up a bit about each episode as they're released. As with the main review, I'll do my best to avoid spoiling anything current when talking about each one, but there may be spoilers for prior episodes as we go along.

There are some tough decisions to be made and consequences to deal with, which really affect the story and leave you wondering if you made the right decision... as once again, people's lives depend on you.\n\nI really enjoyed playing this one, it might not be as truly amazing as season 1, but if you liked the first season, it's a must-play.

The Walking Dead games I feel I can safely recommend to anyone with heart and an appreciation for good storytelling (which, should really be everyone).

Not that there was anything wrong with Lee, but playing as an eleven-year-old girl is so much more interesting.  Clem is inherently and automatically so powerless in some situations, and yet incredibly powerful in ways you wouldn't expect.  That's one reason that makes this one of the more interesting narratives in all of gaming right now.

The game includes difficult choices that ultimately lead to dangerous consequences. However you play it, there will always be hard decisions that require a lot of attention.\n\nThis incredible Telltale game carries on from the previous storyline of Season 1.\n\nI would definitely recommend the game to anyone who has played Season 1 and wants to give it a try,(however if you are thinking of getting Season 2 first, I wouldn't because the gameplay of Season 1 will ultimately affect this gameplay,) personally I bought it during a sale, when it was reduced to £4.99, and I feel as if this game should be worth £15.00 on steam instead of full price of £18.99, but that's just my opinion.\n\nThere are 5 acts in this great game, however Act 1 and 2 didn't really impress me, the gameplay seemed slow and the decisions that needed to be made were relatively simple, and didn't come at a huge cost. However Acts 3, 4 and 5 were much better, with a better more adaptable storyline with more action and more difficult decisions.\n\nPersonally I played this game quite passively and tried to stay out of combat too much, whilst trying to make friends with everyone and not get in their way, however I couldn't do this for the whole game as some decisions required me to choose 1 side.\n\nThe improved gameplay from the first Season also made it stand out more and the Main Menu and UI was improved from the previous season.\n\nI finished the game within a week of buying it, and although it may be a short playtime, it makes up for in gameplay.\n\nLooking forward to Season 3 and hopefully it will be as good as the previous 2!!!\n\nOverall I give this game a 9.1/10!!!!\n\nThe only fault of this game would be watching the credits after every Act, as it gets a bit repetitive!\n\nSPOILER ALERT: Lee will be met again sometime in this playthrough!!!","February 6, 2015","true","9.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The storyline is definately the reason I keep coming back for more with beautifully developed individuals, personalities, situations, choices and plot progression.\n\n(( BEFORE YOU PURCHASE: It would be well worth your time and your money to BUY and PLAY the FIRST game before Season 2 . The choices you make in the first game carry on through to this game! - If you don't, the choices from the firstgame are generated randomly, so its worth buying the first for the emotional connection to the characters, the tough choices you made and seeing the direct consequences of those!))\n\nAlittle different to the first game, also a firm favourite game, in terms of the game interface, instead clicking on the option boxes rather than scrolling through the choices. A little odd to begin with but I found it extremely easy to click back into.\n\nThe graphics are definately easy on the eye and again, my favourite artstyle in a game for a long time. (And it mirrors the Grahic Novels of The Walking Dead. Lets not bring up huge collection of artwork and books from the series that is threatening to cave in the floorboards of my room... haha...)\n\nThe choices you make, the visuals and the audio is fantastic and credit must go to the entire developement team!\n\nOveral, I definately believe people must try this game! If you prefer games such as Call of Duty, Battlefeild or anything in that style in online multiplayer, then it may not be your go-to choice but if you are anything like myself you will like this game.\nIf you love games with character, plot and consequences, this game is definately for you! The characters reach out and touch the sections of your soul that are usually reserved for close friends and family, especially when you have played the first game!\n\nI'm not one to demand, but go play this game! Haha!\n\nTill next time, Can't wait for Episode 3 to hit the store!\n\n~Ree","April 9, 2014","true","10.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This time around, you play as Clementine, and the old protagonist has since past and it is time for her to move on.  I quickly joined on her adventure when I was given a Steam Card for Christmas (Thank you, Grandma! :D) and I went in as soon as possible, literally shaking with excitement!  The first episode, "All That Remains" takes off with a shocking start; and it doesn't get any better from there, as you play on, Clementine goes through all kinds of grusome and grim shist, and now that you are no longer protecting her as Lee Everett, Clementine must learn to take care of herself in a world where the living may be more monsterous than the dead.  If I have to find one bit of critique in this game, it is some of the choices: The choices were difficult to make, but they were a different kind of difficult: I wasn't torn between two choices; I knew which choice I was going to choose, but it really sucked making the choice.  Both of the choices suck, but one just happened to suck less than the other.  It leaves a bad taste in your mouth afterword.  I don't mind those kinds of choices, but those were most of the choices based in "All that Remains".  I want more decitions that leave me torn and questioning the choice that I made.\n\nAnyway, that was the review.  On this episode alone, not counting other episodes, I'd give this a 7.75/10.","December 30, 2013","true","13.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

It such a casual game where your desions can shift the whole story, from deciding who to side with in a argument to who you will choose to save from a pack of walkers the game can play with your emotions from one click of a button. Most franchises argument over who has the better game  and make judgements through graphics, fast pace gameplay and shooting. Telltale says "Screw it, we dont need any of that stuff the make a good game" ill tell you that they do not disapoint, making it one of my most loved games.

You play as Clem an 11 year old girl who witnesses things no person should ever have to see.\n\nThis game has a tendonsy for players to get very attached to some of the characters, this game also has a tallent to turn the story from a zombie horror game to a sob fest in a blink of an eye.

Now while their are choices that have some affect on the story but it don't have as much affect as it did in season 1. Also theirs no way to avoid the death of your companions. In Season 1 it was your fault if someone die unless it was meant to happen but in season 2 no matter what you do 99% of your companions will die. That's my major issue with Season 2 as the choices you make doesn't matter as much as in Season 1. Now while that is a major flaw in this game it's still a good game with a great story and great characters and if you enjoy a game with those features then you will enjoy this game.","August 31, 2014","true","12.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

But this game is mostly unrelated, so don't let that hold you back.\n\nThe graphics are not going to impress you, that's it.  But that's okay too.  TellTale uses a shell shading style that masks the low-end graphics.  But graphics aren't the focus here, story and characters are.\n\nThe characters are well developed in this series, perhaps more so than the first.  The story is more exciting.  The game play has shifted to being more story based and less “lets look around for some batteries.”\n\nThe largest complaint that I had with the first season was that the game purports to be all about the choices you make and how it affects the world.  However, at the end of season one the ending was always the same, or at least nearly the same.  Yes, some characters may have died and others lived, but in the end you ended up in the same situation.  Season two drastically changes that.  In fact, there are several different endings.  I don't even know how telltale plans to stitch this together into a cohesive season 3 without making 5 different games!\n\nConsidering that this game isn't very expensive even at full retail, and it really is one of the best games you can buy, you would be crazy not too.  Who could imagine, our favorite game is one where you play a ten year old girl?","September 6, 2014","true","11.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Choices arent easily made.\nTheres just one point I`d like to point out. Youre playing a adult in a 11 year old body.\nClem isn`t really a child.

It’s heart-breaking in a way to see how time has changed her, to hear the new edge to her voice, to see the new hardness in her eyes and to release in horror the path ahead of her, and what it pertains to. She’s no longer the moral compass, she’s no longer the little girl you try to be a better person around so she can learn from you – she is the culmination of your efforts, and now it’s your job to keep her alive, to keep her safe.\n\nFull Review // http://www.honestgamers.com/12145/pc/the-walking-dead-season-21-all-that-remains/review.html","January 26, 2015","true","12.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's a playable story with limited decisions that you play for the story and good voice acting. So what's up with TWD Season 2? It's good. Not quite as good as Season 1, TWD2 is still a worthy title.\n\nI don't think you can call this game "fun". After all, the choices are depressing. Your ability to actually change things is exceptionally limited. It's more of an interactive story than a game. Still, I find this series compelling to play and the narrative gripping. Clem is one of my most favorite characters in all my gaming years (stretching back to Pong). The voice acting continues to be a major strength of the series.\n\nI found Season 2's quality more variable than Season 1. There were far more gut-punches in #1, far more difficult decisions in #1 than in this season. Still, this has it's moments. But frankly perhaps the biggest flaw is that there are too many characters that you don't really get to know them. They seem - and often are - expendible whereas in Season #1 the group was tighter and better fleshed out.\n\nIf you haven't played Season 1, get that first. But these titles are really worth your time because they tell such great stories.","March 24, 2015","true","22.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Signature Telltale decision making works wonders when incorporated into this kind of plot. There are many dynamic characters, in a wonderful atmosphere. This is a thoroughly enjoyable experience. One thing that particularly stood out was how the decisions in simple conversations brought a personal connection and allowed you to be a part of the relationships you have with characters. Coming from the viewpoint of Clementine, Season 2 seemed to have more opportunity to experiment with that type of decision. Telltale excels in its dialogue as usual. The movement of the plot (including literal movement) seemed to flow better in Season 1, but the emotional affect in breaking that flow makes up for it. It makes me look even more forward to whatever comes next. There's no doubt in my mind that the series will continue to distinguish itself as a really good job at being what it is.","June 27, 2015","true","12.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I really liked the first episode and I can't wait for the other episodes. :)\n\nEpisode 2 : I just finished it and it was amazing. It is the best episode so far. It's amazing how you become part of the group so quickly and gain a lot of trust. In this episode you have to make some pretty tough choices though. I can't say even a little without spoiling anything and that is what is great about this episode. It has many things happening in it. Overall it's a great episode and I can't wait for the next one! :)\n\nEpisode 3 : In Harm's way sets of pretty strange but soon things start to happend. You rejoin with some fellas and even meet with many more and quickly start working together to escape. Some pretty messed up stuff happens. The end is unexepcted and stays a cliffhanger. Dispite that the episode was very good and intence. I am very excited to see whats coming next :)\n\nEpisode 4-5 : The story continues to proceed and more and more dangerous things happend. The group goes north and tries to stay strong and survive. But the problems come from inside the group and thigs start to get messy. You  have to make some pretty tough choices and go though several heartbreaking loses. The game has more than one great endings, all of which are what you would expect from an Tell Tale game. This game and the previous one make some grown people cry like babies and thats what I like about it, it has drama, action and a great dialog.  It's easy to replay and I personally love to play differently every time just to see what the final results will be.\nMy overall opinion is that this game is outstanding and incredibly touching, deserves to be bought and play atleast several times.It's a must play game like the first The Walking Dead for all gamers.

I really liked the first episode and I can't wait for the other episodes. :)\n\nEpisode 2 : I just finished it and it was amazing. It is the best episode so far. It's amazing how you become part of the group so quickly and gain a lot of trust. In this episode you have to make some pretty tough choices though. I can't say even a little without spoiling anything and that is what is great about this episode. It has many things happening in it. Overall it's a great episode and I can't wait for the next one! :)\n\nEpisode 3 : In Harm's way sets of pretty strange but soon things start to happend. You rejoin with some fellas and even meet with many more and quickly start working together to escape. Some pretty messed up stuff happens. The end is unexepcted and stays a cliffhanger. Dispite that the episode was very good and intence. I am very excited to see whats coming next :)\n\nEpisode 4-5 : The story continues to proceed and more and more dangerous things happend. The group goes north and tries to stay strong and survive. But the problems come from inside the group and thigs start to get messy. You  have to make some pretty tough choices and go though several heartbreaking loses. The game has more than one great endings, all of which are what you would expect from an Tell Tale game. This game and the previous one make some grown people cry like babies and thats what I like about it, it has drama, action and a great dialog.  It's easy to replay and I personally love to play differently every time just to see what the final results will be.\nMy overall opinion is that this game is outstanding and incredibly touching, deserves to be bought and play atleast several times.It's a must play game like the first The Walking Dead for all gamers.  I definatelly recomend playing it if you haven't played it.","January 15, 2014","true","12.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

If you're  fan of the series and played the first season and want a little more I would recommend this.\n\nSo this is completely out now.  However i think its worth noting.  I personally would suggest not paying for any tale tale game till the game is complete for two reasons.  One you get all the episodes and don't have to wait (that way theres no production issues you end up waiting longer for, and it should be noted that from the relase date of episode 1 to the release date of episode 6 was more than 11 months.   Thats quite a hefty wait for 2 hours of content per episode)  The second reason is its often at a discount price.","December 27, 2014","true","14.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The second game is even more intense, cruel, sad and mostly touching. I really love this series because it simply has the best story. Because even when humankind faces world full of zombies, they still don't cooperate but murder each other instead. Anyway, this game has it all - apart from the story also perfect voiceovers (including Micheal Madsen as the main antagonist), dramatic music, wonderful comic-style graphics and so on. The only thing some might view as a negative is the fact that it's more as an interactvie film than a game, but that's fine by me.\n9/10","March 18, 2015","true","8.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Robert Kirkman has said that, unlike typical zombie games such as Left 4 Dead, it focuses more on characterization and emotion than action. Well, he was right, after this first game, that made everyone cry at it's end, I couldn't wait for the second one. It's here and it's good, to damn good. I don't think that there's need to describe The Walking Dead: Season 2. It's a 10/10 and you can't argue about it.Here's why:\nA) Characters- They've been revealed so good in this game, that you were playing it you could feel the pain that they felt at that moment, and when the game makes you pick between two main characters you're standing and thinking: "Who shall I pick"\nB) Storyline- First season made everyone, even the most cold-hearted people cry. This one is the same. It's full of drama and every single action you do has it's consequence. Think twice before saying, doing, showing that. As Ken Levine said "We all make choices, but in the end our choices make us" and guess what- it describes this game's storyline perfectly.\nC) Graphics- Ofcourse, there is no need to compare this to other triple A titles, but I'm talking about the design and it's awesome! This comic book style makes it look really cool.\nIs this game worth your money? It sure is. If you got extra cash- don't wait go, pick it up right now.","March 11, 2014","true","17.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Just amazing! The Walking Dead Season 2 was as good as the first one, and a bit better. You think choices don't matter so much? This season's ending changes that all!!\n\nShort Summary of Season 2: Clementine makes it to Omid and Christa and they continue surviving together. Clementine encounters another girl in the bathroom and the girl shoots Omid by mistake. A while after we see Christa and Clem around a campfire. We can see that Christa's baby didn't make it. Christa is attacked by a group of survivors and she and Clem split up. Another group finds Clementine and she continues with this group. A lot of other things happen and we see Kenny back, but to know the rest you just have to play!\n\nOpinion: This was really really amazing. The voice acting is very good and the graphics are more improved than season 1. The soundtrack in every ending of an episode is really nice and the choices you've made are showed in the ending like season 1. I wish here was the short summary in the end of season 2, which shows your relationship with the characters just like season 1. The writing of this season was just as good as the first season and the ending was just a big WOW. I mean I bet everyone didn't even know what to do at that point, kill Kenny who is your old friend but he was losing it or kill Jane who is very experienced but made a very wrong action to show what Kenny has come to? I personally choose to kill Kenny. The reason for this is because he was really losing it and he didn't go well with other group members, after all he wanted to be with Katjaa, Duck and Sarita.\n\nShort list of Pros and Cons:\nPros:\n- Great Graphics\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=468377446\n- Even better story\n- Choices get better\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=469787396\n- Great soundtrack\n\nCons:\n- ??\nOverall Season 2 just amazing, well-written, great graphics and great sound. I recommend it mostly to those who liked Season 1 and like the tv show. If you haven’t played Season 1, you should do that first. I’d rate this 10/10! Played the game?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/urnbont/recommended/261030/","urnbont","dangerhighdoltage","http://steamcommunity.com/id/urnbont/","1542 products in account","Boo! Scary outdoor zombie horror! I didn’t feel scared from the intro screen of trees and a flowing river. Looked more like a multimedia exhibit you see when you go to a national park.  Quiet pines, rolling waters, and piped in elevator music showing how the eco-system works on an LCD screen. Maybe the water doesn't calm you.  It’s slightly unnerving with no people. And the music is in a minor key, making for an unsettling mood. That’s how I played the game pretty much. Unsettled. Fairly intrigued by what may happen next, but not really scared in the least.\n\nThis is a storytelling. You weave in and out of decisions that affect the game, yet not the entire outcome.  Then, at the end, you have some tough choices and at least a handful of endings that I can tell.\n\nEpisode 1 was my favorite.  It had a dog! Woof Woof Woof.. And it’s that odd ability of a dog to make us smile that Telltale uses to explore how delicate the tipping point between a relationship or betrayal can be.  That theme popped up again and again as I played throughout the chapters.  Nothing was safe, everything could turn with one sudden character decision.  Often, that decision wasn't yours.  That made it less interesting, honestly.  I just waited for some character to screw up because my actions did not affect the final outcome as much as I would have liked.  The scene with Clem doing surgery was gut-wrenching and oh my god - really? - yeeesssh. That was hard to watch let alone do the actual actions to finish the job.\nEpisodes 2-3 carry into the storyline well, but Nick is a total downer with his whining! After a time I was just wanted to get rid of him.   The only moment I liked was in the shed when he reveals “I had to kill my Mom.  Sounds weird when it comes out, huh?”.  That was a personal opening up..  Probably the best part since  the rest of the scene he is in a drunken stupor. The episodes tied well together, though, and are an enjoyable part of the story of Clem.  There is a weak point with the main action, however.  If you have seen the TV show or read the graphic novels, it honestly doesn't introduce anything new.  And it makes the game a tad boring because of that familiarity.\nEpisodes 4-5 go into darker territory.  This is heart of darkness stuff where characters don't just lose themselves, they hone a whole new set of malicious skills.  Eventually it comes down to trust and distrust. What constitutes trust in armageddon? Do you trust yourself? Will I survive without my friends?  Would I abandon them or betray them...are they a threat?   Those are the questions that reverberate till the end of the game.\n\nAs for the gameplay. There isn't much there.  Really. Rayman Rabbids is harder.  I  only died once and that was because I didn’t see an object fast enough.  Want to shoot a zombie?  Just click whatever, it’s very hard to miss. Telltale made this extremely user friendly, and while it introduces more casual players, it hurts the gameplay for those of us who like more challenge.  I found this arising time and time again.  When I expected a scene to be stressful while running through windows or grabbing equipment before the time was up, it never happened.  Instead you are literally guided through step by step.  I had more challenge playing Spy Fox with my 7 year old.  Perhaps some folks had issues with season 1 causing them to die several times.  But that’s the fun of it!  I missed dying. Tension.  Where is the tension?  I did not feel any.\n\nVisuals are great ( unless you are addicted to anime and want it to look less messy) and I thought the voice acting *made* many of the characters.  Menus are fine. I was able to play at my max of 1080P with no lag on a mediocre system, and the colors change with the episodes which is neat.  Technically, no issues.\n\nIt’s a good game all in all.  Just wished I could feel more terror and care more about the characters. In season 1, Lee and Clem had a strong relationship that ultimately claimed Lee’s life.  And it gripped you.  WIth Clem on her own, she bounces back and forth from one set of people to the next.  There aren't any strong relationships with anyone.  Even her strongest friends are undermined by that heart of darkness theme. Can’t feel the love, man. No trust.  Makes for a colder story than season 1.  But still a walking dead story to the bone.  If you enjoy storytelling, this is for you.","December 18, 2014","true","23.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","1"

I'll admit I cried like a little girl at the end of it.\nSeason 2 is no exception. Has you on the edge of your seat throuought.\n\nDecisions from Season 1 and the 400 Days DLC are imported if you choose and the events of Season 2 will be altered based on those prior choices. While Season 2 can be started without playing the prior season, I highly recommend doing Season 1 first so that you have a better understanding of what is happening and to have your choices imported rather than being randomly selected for you\n\nOn the emotional side:\nSometimes I want  to play through the entire season 2 in one sitting because it's such a great game. But, I can't. It's too hard. Too emotional. So I have to take breaks. Playing more than two sittings of The Walking Dead a day or every other day is very rare because of the strong heavy emotions it causes. And that is just one of the many reasons that The Walking Dead 2 is such a good game; it causes people to feel real emotions: emotions of hate, love, sadness, scardness. Emotions I can not say I've experienced in quite a while, especially in a game?!. If you can not handle that ^ then don't bother playing this game. because that's what it revolvs around.\n\nOn a technical side:\nGraphics are great, (no surprise there). The camera movements are real, as if you're watching a movie with real people in it. The camera pans in and out and over. Great.\nThe soundtrack is absolutely fantastic throuought, and if you are into music I definitely reccomend listening to the song at the end of every episode while the credits run; most of the time if not aways, it is related to the episide you just completed.\nVoice acting is smooth and powerful with real emotion just like the first season, and unlike any game I have ever seen.\n\nOne tiny negative bit I noticed with this Season is that you cannot use your mouse wheel to scroll down the list of responses to the conversations that you are having, like you were able to do in the first Season. You were also able to scroll through your actions of what you do in the game as well so in this season I find myself misclicking something on the screen because I'm used to scrolling, or I find myself nearly missing a timed answer in a conversation because I remember that I can't scroll and have to click.\nThis minor detail can easily be dealt with , however, because mouse sensitivity on this game (as opposed to Season 1) is much more smooth despite no option to change it, and thus makes choosing one of the choices simple and effortless.\n\nTo recap: Fantastically emotional, personal, and powerful. Music is the best. Unbelievably top notch graphics and mouse movement, with a small change in controlls that can be more than easily dealt with and learned.\n\n\nIf you can not already tell, The Walking Dead: Season 2 is just as fantastic as the first Season, and is definitely (besides The Walking Dead: Season 1) the best game I have had the happy pleasure of playing in the longest time.\n\n☆☆☆☆☆ 5/5 stars all the way","June 11, 2014","true","29.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

To anybody who has not played the first season to begin with, I suggest buying that first, or you simply will not enjoy the game to it's best potential. In relation to it's predecessor, the Walking Dead Season 2 is a remarkable game. Telltale seem to have taken their base game and feedback and improved upon it excessively. To begin with, the normal overlay has been edited to be more eye-catching and simple to allow for a balance, to give a fresh feel to the overlays, as well as improving the graphics wildly with this change and even giving revamps of the Season 1 Cutscenes into HD for the starting titles. It has also allowed for more effective animations and less lag within the game, spec wise improving greatly from where the last game knocked off, preventing more of such bugs as walking glitches and cutscene lag. Story wise- Well. You can't say anything. Telltale seems to strike at every moment they can with their games and have yet again woven an encaptivating tale that is absolutely brilliant! I loved the first episode, if a little short and cannot wait for the second. So far, they have expressed many subtle changes that are seen only from the most skilled writers and I cannot fathom how anyone could not enjoy this storyline and how they express the dire situation of a little girl in a post-apocalyptic world. To anybody who reads this- Buy this game and the first. You will not regret it and will be greatly impressed by Telltale's work.","December 17, 2013","true","10.2"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Just to remind us of how terribly sad we were at the end of that, Season 2 reminds us of our past choices right off the bat. F**k you Telltales!\n\nThe Walking Dead is all about hard decisions. It forces dilemma onto you at every chance it gets, cutting deeper and deeper into your moral consciousness, up to a point where you might feel like being a good guy doesn't always work. TWD offers a terrifying insight into human nature by driving humanity to the edge of extinction. And to make things even better, this time you play through the story from Clementine's point of view. The little girl is not so little anymore after the events of the first season and sets out to survive on her own.\n\nAfter having reviewed the first season, there really is not much to add. It's still a Walking Dead game, it's still a Telltales game. If you enjoyed the first one and are keen to find out how the story progresses, do yourself a favour and pick up Season 2!","January 1, 2014","true","8.5"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

This time you play as Clementine. The story seems to continue not too long after the first season. A new series of characters and nice new story line, and even a nice surprise from Season One (you'll know when you see it). In this case, there are a couple of different endings so you will want to change your game play to see them.\n\nThe only downside, if you can call it that, is that the story seems much shorter than season one. I was surpised by that. I seemed to have finished it rather quickly the first try.\n\nAs usual, bought on discount and worth the $5 I paid.\n\nSo if you are a fan of the first game, this won't disappoint either.","December 27, 2015","true","80.9"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","4"

Some choices and the fates of some characters seemed a bit linear, such as Nick, Sarah, and Luke who, regardless of what choice you make, will still die anyway. Which is a shame, because the entire cabin gang had amazing potential to be story changers, but you still either end up with Kenny (who we already know), or Jane (who basically ♥♥♥♥ed you over multiple times).\n\nAlso, WHAT THE ♥♥♥♥ HAPPENED TO CHRISTA?!\n\nHowever, the game kind of redeems itself at the end, where you can end up in 4 different scenarios for the end. I'm very interested in how this will tie into the 3rd Season or TWD: Michonne.","December 21, 2013","true","25.0"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

You play as Clementine and you'll encounter hardships and trials a little girl should never have to face. It'll have you cringing, looking away from your monitor and looking back again with your hands over your head. I've never cringed due to a game before but this just hits the right emotional spots.

I thought at first that switching the main protagonist from an adult man like the first season, to the little girl that portrayed the daughter-like character would somehow diminish the story somehow and feel like you had less control of situations, but that's not the case: I felt it was much more fun to play as Clem than Lee, in fact.\n\nTelltale likes to tell a great story, and they successfully did so in this season, which I can tell by the, at this time, one episode that's released. You will get a love-hate relationship so strong that you will feel like you are in an abusive relationship with someone you love and still love them anyways. Some of the choices they have make me want to kill them (and they will make you feel) and might have been better if you could somehow change the outcome (like the very beginning, but I guess the story would be much different if it had a split option).\n\nOverall, in season 1 I only cried during the finale of the game (season 1, episode 5), but this season has already made me tear up in just the first episode and I'm not afraid to admit that. Season 1 made you care so much for the character you now control, to the point where they feel real and like family to you, and when you see them in danger you will do whatever you can to fix it.\n\nEven if you have zombie fatigue... Get this... This game is far too good for you to pass up, but you should 100% play season 1 and the 400 days DLC before digging into this one. I cannot wait to see what's in store later on in the season; hopefully I won't have to attack Telltale for ruining it, but I'm sure that won't happen.","December 23, 2013","true","11.6"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","2"

Season Two of Telltale's fantastic Walking Dead, Season Two lives up to its expectations. Although it is perhaps a little short, the story continues seemlessly into Season 2, as the player is put into the shoes of Clementine. Her development and story here from child to adult is just as emotionally charged as Seaon 1, and is a requirement if you loved Season 1. Characters are again Telltale's niche, and the ones on offer here are just as engaging as in Season One. Only negatives are its play time which edges on the short-side, and the reduced number of puzzels in comparrison to Season One.\n\n+ Continues the fantastic narrative.\n+ Again, characters are interesting and dynamic.\n+ Clemtine's transition into adulthood is wonderful writing.\n+ Morally ambiguous choices which stick with the player.\n- A little short in length\n- Reduced number of puzzels/hub areas in comparrison to Season One.","August 12, 2014","true","39.1"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","1"

Alright.. that was awful.\nLet's get started!\n\nSo, i came in ''touch'' with The Walking Dead (s1) and i was like, WOW that Game is frking amazing! but... yeah.. i bought it with the DLC wich means i was so late that all episodes were published and i didn't need to wait!\n\nThe Main game was super awesome, it was full of emoticon (from my side) i was like, Happy,Angry,Scared and much more so yeah it is an intense game with a Great story i never played a better game before...\n\n..until the 14th of December 2013 knocked on my Steam account... The Walking Dead: Season 2 with around 15% Price reduction...\n\nGaben knew he would bring me to pre-order it instant.. i did..\n\nin the same week i played s1 again, just to ..  refresh my mind a bit.\n\nDate: 17th of December\nToday was the Offical release of TWD S2 and i woke up with a boner jumped on my chair, started the PC and started the game. BOOM the Menu design, Theme and style was .. special. i can't describe what i felt but it was awesome. i looked at S1 and thought okay.. S1 was awesome but it could've been better... but hey! it's a COMIC STYLE GAME and i love those ''Point and Click'' games!\nWhatever.\nAfter starting the first chapter i was like WOW You're there were you ended the story of s1 *AWESOMEEEEE*!\nBut... After completing the first Episode... i was sad... sad about not beeing able to play it for two month...\n\nAfter Episode 2 released you see the people from the DLC 400 Days (from S1) which is super cool because... Duh? DLC Content from the 1st game in the 2nd game? ... the game just saves all your decisions and bring them back later to you.\n\nResult:\n+ The Game is worth buying if you like Comic-Styled Point and click games with decisions which will come back at you later in the game.\n+ If you do something wrong that you will regret in the end the game will punch you in the face with that choice so you know .. you made a mistake and have to live with that.\n+ EMOTIONS! (unless you are a Heartless piece of cake)\n\n- The waiting ( which only bothers you if you play since release ^^' )\n\nRight now i'm waiting for S3 and hope it's even better then the 2nd *-*\n\nPlease notice i'm from Germany and my english may not ... be the best ^^.\nMy aim is to write a ''Funny'' and interesting review wich is written in MY opinion and my experience.","January 27, 2015","true","12.3"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

I.... I am unable to find a word to summarise the experience I've had with this game.\n\nPerhaps, combined with Season One, one of the most harrowing emotional roller-coaster rides & engaging game experiences I've had in my lifetime.\n\nThe Walking Dead: Season One was a defining title for Telltale Games, bringing forth not only their well-known respect for licensed properties via Point & Click Adventure Games as they've done in the past such as Sam & Max and Back to the Future, but a choice mechanic that outdoes all before it, providing players up to four choices of dialogue or decisions on a timer with the additional option to remain silent or do nothing. Coupled with purely outstanding storytelling & characters, this created a uniquely engaging player-interactive experience.\n\nSo what's different about Season Two? Apart from the new story it tells & characters you meet, not a lot. Season Two does what Season One did all over again, at least for me; tell a deeply engaging story with outstanding characters, throwing you tough choices to make at many turns. But what has changed this around I can state:\n\n- The UI has been iterated upon, now making choices & on-screen prompts mouse-cursor driven, and Quicktime Events more precise.\n- I seemed to notice a somewhat reduced amount of puzzle-solving compared to Season One. Perhaps not in quantity, but it did seem Telltale Games did take note from the feedback regarding certain puzzle-solving sections from Season One that feedback claimed halted the pace of the game. Maybe the puzzle-solving in Season Two could be better described as more streamlined.\n- Quicktime Events have received quite some improvement from Season One, most particularly with moments where you're required to use a weapon are most often much more precise, most commonly with guns, demanding much higher accuracy from the player & really increasing the tension.\n- Some certain areas that I must leave for you to find out for yourselves.\n\nAll in all, this "Choice & Click Adventure" Game is a game I would recommend to anyone & everyone of a mature age looking for a story, for this highly player-interactive story is one of the finest I know.","August 28, 2014","true","13.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Along the way you'll meet new companions, fight for your life and make some of the hardest choices you can think of. Your morales will be tested, as you are forced to make decisions that will change the entire experience. Right from the word go you'll be sucked in to the story, feeling for all of the characters and by the end of it you'll wonder where all of your time went. The characters are immensely powerful and when you finally reach the rollercoaster of an ending, you will be left with (in my opinion) some of the toughest decisions in gaming.\nI would HIGHLY reccomend this game, it surpasses the first game and replaces it in the spot of my favourite game of all time.

Most of the time you end up with the same exact scenario no matter what you choose, or you don't feel much of a connection to the characters to care enough in the first place. It is generally just a lazy design option promoted as a feature, imho. Well, I can gladly say that Telltale's "Walking Dead" series is a notable exception to that rule - and you'll hate yourself for it.\n\nI played Season 1 on Xbox 360 and loved every bit of it, but I unfortunately couldn't carry my choices over to the Steam edition of Season 2 due to obvious reasons. Still, that didn't stop me from enjoying every single moment of my playtrough, which much like the original, constantly puts the player in tough places. The thing is, Telltale clearly gets what made the "Walking Dead" comics so great : the human factor. The point&click adventure style of the game fits the theme perfectly, allowing you to experience Kirkman's creation in a totally different way. The script and characters as a whole are nothing but excellent, not lacking in anything in relation to the original work.\n\nIf you haven't played Season 1, know that although it is not mandatory to comprehend the plot, it allows you to further understand the characters behavior and grow a lot more attached to them, so I highly recomend checking it out before getting this. In the end, TWD: Season 2 is an excellent call for players who appreciate story-driven games and fans of the comics - or even of the substandard TV series for that matter.","December 7, 2014","true","9.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Cringe from the physical pain Clementine is going through and it really hits you hard that your darling Clementine is doing this to survive. The whole episode really shows how valorous Clementine is to survive. My personal favorite and most memorable event in the series... and you have to do it yourself; there's no cutscene here.\nThe final climactic scenario (no spoilers!) really shows how your choices throughout the season all come crashing down, which was interesting while disappointing considering that choices of interpersonal communication among Clementine and other survivors was so small and infrequent juxtaposed to the first season. The finale leaves you to choose what your morals are and ultimately question them or stand by them... hesitantly.Overall, I didn't enjoy it as much as the past season, but that's a scenario you can't recreate and its execution was very well done. But, the few moments I stated above are definitely worth it, and they're worth it only through playing through the entire game. TWD has become more smart in the second installment, and you can become more emotionally involved as the girl you once protected from the new world.\nYou'll want to question if you can watch Clementine go through what she goes through twice when you replay the game. That's something you don't feel in other games. It's worth something (especially when it's 66% off!

There isn't much as far as "choices" go, but the decisions that you do make are exciting to see in play into the story factor. Regardless of your actions, it seems the pipeline is simply plug n play with different character names and photos, so you're really not changing much, just the order.

The consequences of your choices may do noting, change your relationship with someone  or kill someone and make your cry ;( . After this game no matter what gender you are you FEEL like you are Clemintime and you are in the apocalypse. The game macanics work magically with the point and click gameplay style at first you may find it boring but then it just ...... words can not explain. The moment you think the group you are in are safe something happens and in this game you find someone not saying who for those who have played the first game and not shore if this game is worth but when you find him you will nit look at any more the one option to humg him :) . This game somehow (I was not expecting it) was miles better then the first one when you see Clemintime make the choices no child should make it makes you feel as if you are loosing who she was in the first game but you can see glimses of her through out the game. I feel the main object of the game is not to survive but to keep Clem and the group from becoming monsters and no not the walkers but monsters who have no emotion. The only downfall of this game is that there is a few technical hiicups now and then but they won't bother you in the slightest.  In conclusion if you havn't played the first one buy that and if you enjoy it buy this and if you have allready played the first one (the chances are that you enjoyed/that game was your life) buy this ;) 10/10","October 9, 2014","true","10.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Another thing are the plot/game twists, it's pretty low on decisions that completely change "your" story, that however isn't an issue, only a few of the previous episodes had multiple such options, there will be time to add more in the next ones.\n\nThere is only one thing I really didn't like, the new UI, it feels awkward and it also isn't that accurate when you're trying to click on the interaction options, I didn't play it like that, but I see it working better for controllers which it was fully developed for (the menu is another sign of this game not being developed for mouse and keyboard).\n\nLast but not least, those of you (us) who didn't  really enjoy Clementine as a character, her naive personality and the occasional voice acting of questionable quality (the ending on season 1 suffered from that greatly even if the overall package was excellent), you will be surprised, she's back as a more mature and way better voiced Clementine, fitted to take Lee's role as the main protagonist, in season 2 she's more of a young Lara Croft than a scared puppy.\n\nIn conclusion this is a great sequel to the first season and everyone should get it, unless they don't like Telltale's cliffhangers which this also is subjected to, but that only makes me eager to play the next episode.","January 3, 2014","true","10.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Improving on a lot of the systems, you have chances to mend broken relationships and create all new connections with new and old characters as you continue your story through the eyes of Clementine.\n\nReview\nThe Walking Dead: Season 2 continues a few months after the events in season 1 bringing together a whole new cast of characters with characters from its predecessor where new connections, relationships, and decisions will be formed.  Along with the new characters is a new perspective, where you once playing as an adult who had the strength to deal with the walkers head-on, you now play as Clementine, a young girl who has to use her wits in order to survive.  As with the predecessor, you are in control of your life, making various decisions for good or for bad to help mold Clementine into the character that you want her to be seen as; I feel as though the decisions have been changed for the better as they still impact you, but will not create as drastic of changes as to how each character views Clementine.  Although your decisions can change certain outcomes to an extent, you are generally tied to the story and will be limited in what can actually be changed.  Although the changes may be limited, the story is still full of mystery, suspense, and action to lead the player to want to know what comes next.\n\nPros\n+ Unique story\n+ Improved decisions system\n+Connect with characters\n+ Point and click style\n\nCons\n- Decisions cause limited impact towards the world\n- Episodic, can take a month or two for the next episode","July 14, 2014","true","14.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In season 2, the story continues and gets crazier and crazier the more you progress through the game. Even if you dont like the walking dead, you still will love this game and have emotions at moments of the game for characters and actions that happen. Season 2 left me wanting even more for this game, I was pumped when I heard that they announced a season 3  for the walking dead game even though it looks like its far off from realese due to TellTale making several other amazing emotional games like this like game. Everybody NEEDS to play this series.This is one of the few games that made me cry in my whole gaming experience other then a few other games but there really arn't many games that do this to you. That is what makes this game so awesome ontop of the storytelling its a long rollercoaster throughout the game to survive. You get to make decisions that affect the story which is cool so its almost asking what you would do if this was you in this situation and what you choose effects the story and your choices carry over to the next season etc. Two words, BUY IT!","January 6, 2015","true","11.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/overwatchsector/recommended/261030/","overwatchsector","Uberwatch","http://steamcommunity.com/id/overwatchsector/","167 products in account","The Walking Dead : Season 2? Where do I begin? Well first, I'd like to say that Telltale has once again handled the dark nature of the TWD universe successfully in this installment. The second season of the game in my opinion is another worthy entry of the ongoing franchise.\n\nLike the seasons of the TV show, Season 2 of the game stands out with a different tone and feel than the previous season. In Season 1, we played as Lee Everett, a man given a second chance in life during the zombie apocalypse after he just murdered someone. Season 1 of the game explored the idea of being a father figure to an orphaned young girl, Clementine and trying to raise a child in the beginning of what can be considered a terrible world.\n\nSeason 2 evolves from that. In this game, you play as Clementine herself and the world in this state of the game doesn't give a damn if she's a child or not. She's a survivor. It's 16 months after the initial outbreak and other survivors living in the wilderness or broken cityscapes are more hardened and adapted than before. Many are untrustworthy and some are honest, good people. Season 2 brings the character of Clementine from an innocent child to a more mature 11 year old that can handle herself. This makes her feel underestimed by the adults she comes across. So basically, Season 2 is kind of about growing up early.\n\nAbout the story itself, well I'd say it's well-written for what it is. You get to know a lot about the new characters and older ones that reappear feel more fleshed out than before. You get allies that you may end up hating and encountering a villain that you can somewhat agree with. The only problem with the story is that the 5 episodes are shorter than the first season. But because the story of the second season is so engaging, it makes up for that.\n\nNow is it better than the first season? Yes and No. Unfortunately for the second season, there is a lack of puzzles that were present in the first season. The second season is mainly going through dialogue choices and picking up items to push the story forward. There is also a lot more main character deaths in Season 2 than the first. So if you get attached to one character, don't expect him or her to live long. But then again, this is the Walking Dead. Quick character deaths in all 3 mediums (Comic,TV show, game) are to be expected. However the second season shines in better voice acting, interesting new locations and well-acted villain by the name of William "Bill" Carver.  Oh and the combat against walkers are a little bit improved. And one more thing, the game has 5 different endings. 2 of them can lead you to entirely different locations. This makes me wonder how unique the first episode of the Third season can start.\n\nAnd is it a good entry to The Walking Dead franchise? Yes. I always felt the game has really been it's own thing. The comic book is about the story and journey of Rick Grimes. The TV show is simply an adaptation of the original comic but also puts it's own spin on various storylines. The game is about Clementine. Lee Everett may have been the original protagonist of the first season, but it's still about Clementine.\n\nIf there's truly one great thing about TWD : Season 2, it's that it grabs you emotionally. It doesn't matter how imperfect the game is, Telltale cares enough to grab the audience's emotions...\n\nSo yes, I recommend this game to all Walking Dead fans.\n\n","January 6, 2015","true","19.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

I've already completed S1 on xbox and I just played the first episode of S2. This game is something else let me tell you.

Every time you have to make a split second decision on this you feel the panic as if you were actually there and thats what truely captures that frightened, survivor feel.\nWithout spoiling anything, imagine if you have to choose between going with one person and choosing another, its a panicked situation and you don't have time to plan out the decision so choose quickly and choose NOW. These make or break scenarios which are scattered both obviously and subtley are what makes this and any other similar telltale game a masterpiece.\nIts been beautiful watching Telltale become the powerhouse in game and story telling that they now are.

The game is more like an interactive story, focusing more on storytelling rather than moment-to-moment action. Thus, this game is not for you if you're looking for the next innovative, fast-paced, gameplay. If you're looking for a strong story that may or may not leave you emotionally devastated, this is for you.\n\nLike the first game, the gameplay is more of a classic "point and click" adventure style game. Throughout the game you'll be able to move around in a very limited area and investigate points of interest by highlighting them with the cursor and using a few different action keys. There are also plenty of quick time events, although unlike other games they feel..."right" for the genre rather than out of place and annoying. The gameplay is nothing to be excited about - instead, it is a means of interaction, allowing you as a player to move the story along and make key decisions.\n\nAgain however, the story is what you're here for. Season 2 picks up after the events of Season 1 and its small DLC, 400 Days. You have the option of importing decisions you made in the first game over to new games in Season 2, although this is not necessary (but I recommend it nonetheless of course).\nYou play as Clementine this time, one of the primary characters from Season 1. The gameplay/story differs a bit because unlike last time, you are now a little girl in a zombie apocalypse. Characters amy underestimate you or treat you differently due to the large age difference, along with giving you as a player a fairly different perspective when it comes to making decisions and interacting with characters.\n\nOther minor details is the appreciated addition of a "move faster" button that you can hold down, so that plodding nature of your character doesn't slow things down too much. In addition, the artwork and graphics seems to have improved compared to Season 1, and there is a greater variety of environments and colours used.\n\nFor those who played through Season 1, Season 2 is definitely worth getting. Aside from continuing the story and potentially crying some more, Season 2 doesn't feel any weaker and continues to hold up Telltale's golden storytelling standards.\n\nIf you haven't played any of the Telltale Walking Dead games (or many of their other games for that matter, such as Wolf Among Us), I highly recommend this series if you're at all interested in good story and don't mind a much simpler gameplay.","January 29, 2015","true","9.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Multiple times. But that isn't meant in a bad way. Just like the first Season of The Walking Dead it is really interesting to see the character developement in this game. This game (aswell as the prequel) are in my opinion one of the greatest pieces of art there is in video game culture at the moment. You may think the zombie theme is overused right now but this game is bringing this scenario to you on a new level. You start to personificate with Clementine and i personally partially sat in my bed thinking about the decisions i made in game even hours after i had played.\n\nI am not quite sure if i like it more than the prequel. The minor bugs that kinda bugged me in the first game aren't to be seen in this game. Still i for myself found it easier to personificate with Lee in the first game, which is probably caused by the fact that i am a near-adult man.\n\nIn the end, I think of this game as one of the best sequels i could have imagined. The short time you will need for this game (it took me ~10h) is one of the very few drawbacks. Still a lot of people will find replayability in this game, just to see how other decisions would have influenced the game. If this game is ever on sale (and knowing Steam, it will be)\nbuy it as well as the first season. It is more than worth the money.\n\nSo. All summed up. Telltale never fails to make a story you will still remember in months. And this game is another great example for this.  One of the greatest experiences the gaming market has to offer at the moment.\n\nMy personal rating: 92/100\n\nI am already hyped for Season 3.","January 29, 2015","true","11.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It followed Lee and Clementine, an unlikely pair, and their group of survivors. The five episodes of the season were less like episodes of a television show and more like episodes of strife; they came upon the videogame playing public like a storm and settled there all year, making us both sad and elated until the tragic completion of the saga. The narrative and emotional weight that The Walking Dead Season 1 dumped on us caused a collective reaction that put the game in the number one spot of many game of the year lists, and since that time we have been awaiting the further adventures of a now-alone Clementine. The Walking Dead Season 2 has arrived to sate our desire, but if the first episode speaks for the rest of the season, it cannot even approximate the capabilities of its predecessor.","January 23, 2014","true","30.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

To begin, I'm a big fan of Telltale games. The first game I experienced with choices and decisions that can influence the path of the story and with this kind of cinematic-playtime-choice making type of game was Heavy Rain. Obviously, it's not the same game at all but it was kind of like it in some ways. I hated it. When I played the first walking dead game Telltale games made, I completely changed my mind about this type of games. It was simply... awesome. Here's what the game is about.:\n\nThe Walking Dead series put you (the protagonist) through a series of events that could occur during a zombie apocalypse, leaving you in a situation where you'll have to make choices to gain trust, to decide what to do in a certain situation, to express who you are and how you'd react to similar events. The story is probably one of the greatest tales I've heard in my whole life. It will play with your emotions and action is always around every corner. This game is fantastic.\n\nI suggest watching a video of a playtrough just to see the first 5 minutes if you don't know what to expect but I strongly recommand both games and a similar game, The Wolf Amoung Us, made by Telltale Games too which is very good.","July 30, 2014","true","13.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Following Clementine, a young girl orphaned and fighting to survive in a world turned to hell, the five-part story explores the human spirit, the bond of love and the limits of human sanity.\nIf you're looking for an open-world, non-linear game focused on exploration-you won't find one here. What you will find is one of the most compelling emotional rollercoasters in the history of gaming,with every decision you make riddled with doubt, angst and uncertainty. I thoroughly enjoyed my time with Telltale's The Walking Dead Season 2, and would highly recommend to anyone looking for a compelling story and a sense of involvement and immersion every step of the way.","December 23, 2014","true","11.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You play Clementine this time and go through what would seem as a "what would Lee do" at times, but of course Clementines has her own character.\n\nAfter finishing chapter 5, I could not help but feel terrible of the choices I made, notiably the last couple before the credits rolled. Never have I felt more uncomfortable making a tough choice over close to 30 years of gaming. Telltale truly delivered in bringing me the dark world of The Walking Dead.\n\nThe one thing that I do noticed which felt like a downgrade for season 2 was the fact that it felt less intereactive and adventurous compared to the diversity of the 1st season. Not only did I feel that the first 3 episodes went by quickly, but at times felt like there could of been more to it. Perhaps this was done to help with pacing and have the player feel more engaged.\n\nOverall, The Walking Dead Season 2 is A MUST play for those who enjoyed Season 1. For those who haven't so and are interested, play both seasons as that is the way its meant to be played, you will not regret it, except perhaps some of the choices you'll make in game.","January 2, 2015","true","11.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

That said, the major decisions here were much bigger ones.\n\nThe story was a massive improvement in this one and was genuinely interesting.

It's a beautiful pseudo-2.5D world that could use a little better AA but still looks gorgeus. You interact with people who are distinguishable and interesting.You make dialogue decisions (and sometimes action decisions) that aren't always so black and white, with the option of saying absolutely nothing always there. You make big decisions that in the end you realize made no difference whatsover, but that little side response you made totally changed the plot's direction an episode later.\n\nTotally worth the money to sit back with the simple controls, and watch the guts fly.\n\nBTW wear goggles.","June 21, 2014","true","5.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

Even though you do not much in this game than smashing buttons, move forward, move left, move right or make conversation it never gets boring. The story is amazingly stunning, espacially if you are watching the samenamed TV series.\nThe game isn't about showing your shooting skills, but about making desicions about trusting people, helping them and keeping care of yourself. The characters are all individual and interesting designed, some more sympathic than others, but with the happenings people's behavior will change in the game.\nYou are able to make like 15% of the game's plot based on your desicion, e.g. you choose from two people who will you help surviving. That doesn't sound that much, but it's alright- to be honest, it was enough burden for me to burry ;) The music fits the atmosphere just fine and the system that shows you how often people made the same desicions as you did is a nice feature too.\n\nTo name the bad aspects as well I have to admit that you really have to like the graphic style. It is kind of comic based and I really had to get used to it, but in the end I am glad it looked like this (some brutal scenes might have scared me a lot more if it had been a more realistic graphic).\nThe game isn't that cheap for what it offers, but I bought it while it was on sale and I'd totally do again.\nAt the end of every episode there are credits that can't be interrupted. This might be annoying if it wasn't for the beautiful, sad music that made you think about what happend in the episode.\n\nAll in all I totally recommend this game for anyone who is into story-based games, the TV series, comic style graphics or anyone who just wants to test his ethical oppinions.

The storyline is just as good and they even threw in some different actions to make the game feel less point and clicky. Another way that I think was improved on this season than on the last season was that you didn't have as much unnecessary talking options. The only time you really had to talk to another character in this game is if it "made them remember you said that" which is personally enjoyed. The last game felt dragged out because of all the conversations that you would have with other people and in the end you didn't even need to be talking to them about that to effect anything. On the other hand it made the game feel more realistic. I don't know, take it how ever you want.\nOverall, great game. Amazing story. Was in tears yet again. Can't wait for season 3.","October 31, 2014","true","66.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Only game that has made me cry and terrified at the same time it is amazing. i recomend this game 100% to those of you who thinks "oh look a point and click game not gonna even try" i had the same tought going into this game. But man the story is better than anything tv can spew out these days. in my opinion its better than the walking dead tv show. And to top it all of you are in full control of the story do you wanna kill that guy? sure, but know it will maybe cause consequense for you later. i love it, i aboslutely love it!

The animation has improved visibly since the first installment, and the voice actors have all remained consistent while still showing a believable amount of maturation for their characters. The storyline is excellent, and the choices you make affect the outcome more than they did the first time around. The controls have become slightly more complex as well, adding another element to your gameplay. Worth the buy, but I would highly recommend using a controller.","March 1, 2015","true","9.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This story, these characters, everything draws you in and immerses you into a dangerous world where you truly feel that all hope is lost. Some parts will make you laugh, or simply crack a smile, while others will send tears running down your eyes as you witness the death of yet another beloved character...yet another comrade taken by things far worst then zombies. If your a fan of season one then you should need no convincing! Season two is just as good or I dare say even better then the first, and this is coming from someone who is only on episode 2 of the second season, and already its been an emotional roller coaster. If your a fan of the show then I will just be blunt with you, in my honest opinion, this game is 10x better then the show is or most likely ever will be. It might just be a game, but the characters are just so much more interesting, you feel drawn to them and when one of them is forever silenced not only do you feel sadness, but a burning anger as well.\n\nYour choices mold the story, you decided who to befriend and at times who lives and who dies. The decisions are hard, the consequences even harder, but in the end it all comes down to survival of the fittest, and as you steer young Clementine through this dangerous world and watch her grow into a young women you'll start to look back on your past decisions with regret. The fact that once you make the choices their set in stone is what makes the game so fun, just like in realy life once you make a choice there is no going back.\n\nEDIT: After finally completing the game I must say that the ending was very satisfying indeed, you actually get to decide how it ends unlike the first one where what happens at the end of the game is set in stone. As a man, I'm not afraid to admit that tears were shed towards the end of this game, and the fact that a videogame can make me shed tears at all makes this one of the best games out there in my book.","February 26, 2015","true","8.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/EmilyL1692/recommended/261030/","EmilyL1692","Trashy Egg","http://steamcommunity.com/id/EmilyL1692/","15 products in account","The long awaited sequel to the acclaimed Telltale adventure, The Walking Dead: Season 2 offers just as much excitement and emotion as its predecessor. The game now allows players to take the role of the beloved Clementine, whom we saw abandoned at the close of Season 1. Clem is now older and more hardened to her cruel apocalypse life. Players quickly meet new characters (friends and foes) that have many mysteries behind them. Though at first it is hard to accept those that feel like replacements for our lost allies of the first game, after Episode 1, I found I had warmed up to this interesting bunch. The new threat of a captivating villain known as Carver paralells events which have occured throughout the universe before. Although it seems like a repeat of the "evil group" trope we've come to know, this plot line (without giving away too much) has some twists. Many moments throughout bring heartache, tension, and moral conflicts the likes of which are not often given in video games. The final scene of the newest episode, In Harm's Way, is one of the most thrilling and hard-hitting gaming experiences I have ever had, causing my heart rate to rise and sticking with me for hours after (but again, no spoilers). Aside from some minor graphics errors (ie. objects phasing through each other) here and there, Season 2 has shown a great improvement. The controls are much easier to handle, allowing for better sensitity and a more user-friendly "choices" interface. The game also implements new actions, mostly involving the use of the arrow keys for dodging and loosening items. Overall, this game is a must have. I am very excited for the next installment, and hope that the story of Season 2 rounds of as amazingly as I expect it will.","July 3, 2014","true","13.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This story will test your humanity with every move you make. It will make you hate yourself and feel great when you do that one thing that makes things look better for everyone well being. It will toug the heart strings and sucker punch you before you know it. Ask anyone you know that has played this and if they don't say but it as soon as you ask then they are crazy.
