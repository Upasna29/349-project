The main mechanic is the ability to create a clone of Pete, the main character. The clone will help you jump further, access places you couldn't go before, and do other cool things. Currently, there are 4 worlds, with quite a large number of levels in total. Each world introduces a new mechanic of some type, such as force fields.This is a bargain! The developer keeps updating, fixing bugs, and responds to the community. Its an interesting platformer/puzzler with some nice mechanics.","March 10","true","0.6"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","0"

You play as Pete, a guy who likes to collect gems and has the ability to create clones of himself, aka RePetes. RePete will do whatever Pete was doing during the 'clone recording' process. You can have RePete stand on buttons to open doors, flip levers to make platforms move, and even go through the gate to finish the level. In later levels you can create 2, 3, and even 4 RePetes to solve the puzzles.\n\nThe puzzles start out pretty easy, with the first world consisting mainly of tutorial levels. But once you get to worlds 3 and 4, you are sure to spend some time scratching your head, as these levels can be devilishly tricky. Even so, with just 64 levels (for now?), RePete only takes an hour or two to get through all the levels. Fortunately, there is plenty of replay value created by the challenge times and hidden gems for each level.\n\nThe gameplay in RePete is pretty simple. For controls have directional control(left/right), jump(up), and lever activation(down) with the arrow keys, and space to create RePetes. I was able to use an XBOX One controller as well, though the button mapping isn't stated anywhere and is counter intuitive in some cases(B will advance you in menus, rather than take you back a screen).\n\nThe 16bit graphics style and sound aren't going to blow you away. However, they are very well made and fit the game style perfectly. I didn't encounter any graphical glitches, and only encountered minor gameplay glitches. The only notable bug was Pete getting forced into the ground by a closing door. Other than that, the game was mostly free of any unintentional frustrations.\n\nOverall, I give RePete a 8 out of 10. It is very fun, undeniably challenging, and solidly built. There are a few minor points that could use polishing, but nothing that prevented me from thoroughly enjoying this game.\n\nSo what are you waiting for? Go play RePete!","March 14","true","0.1"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

Basically, you can record a copy of yourself doing stuff, and then cooperate with your recording to solve the puzzle. The recording time is limited to something around 20 seconds, and the recording also doesn't loop (unlike in Misadventures of Winterbottom).\n\nThe Good:\n- low price\n- 64 levels, and they do get pretty difficult after about level 22\n\nThe So-so:\n- very early puzzles start to rely on precise timing. I know there are people who like finger dexterity contests (e.g. fans of Meatboy) but I'm a kind of player who wants to simply figure out how the puzzle should be solved and not spend next 15 minutes torturing myself with precise execution. But that's really a matter of taste or age (I'm 34).\n\nThe Bad:\n- annoying music which resembles that in NES games from the 80s, I had to turn music off after a few minutes\n- can't re-map keys. I kept pressing Space to jump because of my habit from other games, but space actually records your clone..\n- the graphics are pretty bland, almost amateurish - nothing comparable to the gorgeous visuals of Misadventures of Winterbottom, for example. Even in this quasi-8 bit style some decorative elements would help liven the scenery a bit.\n\nConclusion: buy it if you are really into time-travel stuff (like myself), tried the other games I mentioned and still want more.","April 10","true","0.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Playing co-op with past versions of yourself and inputing commands for your future self creates a great 4th dimension to this game. On at least two occasions I was completely stuck on a level without any idea how to proceed, which was great because it meant I had to play around with the mechanics until I found a solution(no online walkthroughs obviously). Really looking forward to more levels.","March 15","true","8.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
