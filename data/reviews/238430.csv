I have owned it a while. I enjoy it. But there's a ton of people posting negative reviews for stupid reasons. Up to and including: - Shooting zombies is very ineffective unless it's the head (Yes someone actually posted this).  I think too many people compare it to Left 4 dead and other similar games and it's a different experience. People also are complaining about the devs responses, when they leave up posts calling thier game outright trash, ect. ect. . I enjoy coop games, I really enjoyed SWAT 4, I enjoy Left 4 Dead, Payday, and I enjoy this. That being said here's a realistic pro / con list for you:\n\nPro\n-Co oP is fun-\nYou need to share ammo. You need to share weapons. Health kits are super rare and you have to arbitrate who they go to.  You have to work together.\n\n-Immersion-\nRage zombies were never my thing. Nothing against them but to me the slow shambling ones are the way it's done. If your a fan of oldschool zombie movies- There ya go. It's got that feel to it. Voice acting-A lot of work went into this. It's not stellar by any means but there are two radials with different sayings for most of them. Top that off the characters will be louder or quiet based on certain factors (If the person is crouching or havent done any movements yet - the voice of character will be quieter than usual. If character took a shot or someone near by shot - they will speak loud. They will also speak loud when they were running for quite long time or there is action going on).  If someone goes down, they become a zombie and can call the horde and hunt down thier former friends. I always had a lot of fun with it and it helps with the immersion which is a big thing in games for me.\n\n-Modes-\nThere are a fair number of modes for this game. I look at some of the games coming out nowadays like Evolve (Don't get me wrong I enjoy it, I play it, but it was too much for what it was) that are essentially one game mode stretched to thin. The same could be said about a lot of games, some would say it about this one, but at least they tried. I tested some of the other ones, none were as much fun as coop.\n\nCon\n-The graphics are dated-\nThis isn't a deal breaker for me but it is for a lot of people "OMARGAWRD THUR GRUAFAX".\n\n-The Co-op is unintuitive-\nIt's true, there's not going to be any Left 4 Dead highlighting of objectives. You have a cell phone that you check that tells you where to go / what to do. You have to actually figure it out for yourselfs, i.e. where the basement is, where the helipad (the roof) is, and so on. To the devs, this would really be my only gripe. Some things are easy to figure out, others can feel absurd. Play the police station and try finding keys the first time, you'll probably get the idea. I had friends drop this game just based on the fact they were tired of running around, sometimes dying because we couldn't find some objective. If you intend on playing coop, and new to the map- look up a guide of the map. You'll thank me. I'm not saying the Dev's should implement highlights, but something a little more informative with messages would vastly improve this game imho.\n\n-Not really a SinglePlayer Experience-\nThe story will be the same regardless, nothing grandiose. Just the same mission or surviving alone. This game is meant to be played with friends. I have heard that there are griefers online, and people have complained about it in the reviews. There are griefers in any multiplayer experience. It's not the dev's fault. Seen it in Ark, Seen it in Payday, Seen it in Left 4 Dead, Seen it- You get the idea. Hell any survival game with limited resources is begging to be griefed. So- Play with friends if it bothers you, or find a good coop server. I have personally never had the issue of running into griefers on this as of yet, but have only played on online servers a handful of times. Those times I did, people were greedy with ammo, and weapons, but didn't grief.\n\nAll this being said, I would reccommend this game. There's still some things that could be added that could improve it, but if you're a fan of old school zombie movies like I am, then get it. Maybe wait till it goes on sale if the price tag is too high for you, but worse case scenario - If you don't like it well good news everyone steam has a return policy now. But play it with friends. All games are more fun that way, especially this one.","July 28, 2015","true","45.8"," 516 of 587 people (88%) found this review helpful 34 people found this review funny","88","516","587","34","31"

You select from a handful of characters to decide who you want to be and go straight to business; shooting zombies and people. There are different modes in the game in which you can play: Escape, hunt, and extract.\n\nEscape:\nThis is the primary mode that this game was probably built for. It is purely PvE where players come together to find a way out of a selected environment. There are different difficulties to test your skills in both individual and team gameplay. What I found really unique and interesting in this mode was that everytime you played it, it was always some what different every run. Your pathing to the ending of each map was usually different and this somewhat made the game mode fresh everytime.\n\nWhat I found to be a failure in this mode was that the ending of escape was always the same and my incentive to play again was minimal. There are no rewards for completing and it gets really repititive. Basically all you did was shoot zombies, find objectives, and get out. Another thing was how it could be absurdly difficult at times. Although this was also a reason as to why it was somewhat fun, a lot of the time you would find yourself back tracking to find missing objectives or paths to work your way to the end, all the while wasting ammo on zombies because you had no choice. Another thing was that players could turn into zombies if they were attacked or dead. I could see how dead players who turned to zombies could potentially create a left 4 dead PvP scene where teamwork is key, but the problem is that zombie players could single-handedly wipe out a whole team of players because thats just how strong and difficult a zombie player is to handle (I literally just walk in zig zags and no one could kill me and I would just kill them in like 5 hits). This adds to frustration of playing this mode as if looking for objectives while fighting AI zombies wasn't already a chore. My suggestion would to make this purely PvE and leave PvP for hunt and extract, which I will discuss about next.\n\nHunt:\n\nIf all you want to do is walk around and shoot people or be a zombies and kill people, this is the mode for you. It is purely PvP. Everyone starts out with a basic secondary weapon (handgun) and melee weapon and have to search for weapons that can be found in various areas across a map. While doing so, players will encounter eachother and kill eachother. But again, it can feel repetitive as the sole purpose of this mode is to just walk around killing eachother (Of if you like the classic camping you can do that too)  till the round ends with only 1 survivor or the round times out.\n\nBecause of how the mode is set up to end, players are basically encouraged to actually camp if they want to win. This can really ruin the fun as some people play it for the action and interactions between finding eachother. You could go AFK in a basement and win the round by doing literally nothing because while you decided to sit like a scared child, other people were actually playing the mode as how it was supposed to be played; by finding and killing eachother. You will find out yourself about how the community may react to you camping if you decide to play this game/mode.\n\nExtract:\n\nThis mode is probably one of the least favorable modes in the game. What you do is work as a team to find AI survivors and rescue them to a safe point. Although this sounds potentially challenging or fun, it is again very boring and repititive (in my opinion,  of course). There is no real goal in this mode because once you rescue the AIs, you are back to square one; Finding and saving AI's again. You will eventually find yourself leaving the game rooms as you die from zombies and ultimately boredom.\n\nMusic/Sounds:\n\nWhat really shines, in my opinion, is the music and sounds of the game. It is very high quality and really fits the overall theme of the game. It creates an eerie feeling to the game when playing and is what really drew me into the game's atmosphere. Voice acting is great as well, although most of these characters are abit too grumpy and mad (For good reason probably).\n\nGraphics:\nThe graphics in this game are good if not great. Theres really nothing bad to say about the graphics... Besides sometimes I would enter servers where the game was all choppy at times and looked like I was playing an 8-bit game with low FPS. Other than that, graphics meet basic/standard expectations.\n\nWeapons:\nThere are plenty of guns/weapons in this game. Honestly, depending on which weapon you have, alot of them are pretty similar in terms of effectiveness. Although you'll probably find  some guns to be a lot weaker and useless compared to others ( F****** colt), it isn't really an issue to the game.\n\nCharacters:\nThe handful of characters as I mentioned in the beginning of the review, all have the same value in the game. There is no OP or weak character, it is all preference of how you want to look. Sadly, I would have prefered to be able to customize my own character or let the characters available to have stats so that it would fit people's preferred playstyles. In this game's case, your best bet is to be the black guy (No racism intended) because he best blends into the night and camouflages very well in PvP.\n\nConclusion:   6.5/10 Rating\n\nUltimately, what really brought Contagion down is the repititiveness of the game. The replay value of this game is really low, as I have dropped and picked up this game on and off over the year, only playing it every few times a month when I was really bored. Content is slow to release and while there is a steam workshop for this game, there isn't much it has to offer because this game lacks strong popularity within the zombie fan community. You will find yourself picking up this game for about the first hour or so, and then immediatly dropping it if you have no friends to play with.\n\nThanks if you actually read this long review. Although it seems like im not recommending this game at all, surely it is not the case. This game did have its great and fun values. But it only hit me ever so softly, and I feel that it can be fixed.\n\nIs it worth trying this game? Yes definitely, but get ready to drop it.\nIs it worth the money? No, I would recommend buying it on sale.\n\n\nTL;DR:  This game can be fun, but gets boring and repititive too quickly to really be worth its costs. I would still recommend trying it though if you can get it at a low price.","October 31, 2014","true","37.8"," 486 of 557 people (87%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","87","486","557","18","2"

It is that simple.  Also, team killing is rife which completely destroys the gameplay and forces individuals to use the easier non-TK servers which quickly become boring.  The developers have also taken no action against the numerous trolls who use certain choke points in the levels to ensure that gamplay is stopped.   The game community is almost completely extinct largely due to the developers shocking attitude to their customers.\n\nLR;  When I first started playing Contagion last year the Developers were embroiled in a lengthy update process.  The community was disnechfranchised including certain individuals who had supported via Kickstarter and were still waiting on rewards.  I decided to let that slide and decide for myself.\n\nThe gameplay is good with tense moments and very acceptable graphics using the CS engine.  To the developers credit some of the levels are huge, the biggest in the Steam library by some estimates.  Nice use of fire and shadow makes for interesting human versus zombie battles.\n\nOnce killed a human player becomes a zombie and must attack and kill/turn the remaining human survivors.  However this creates a unique dynamic because once killed you drop your weapons and ammo.  Players naturally want certain weapons or more ammunition and team kill individuals to get it which forces the majority of the community to use non-TK servers which are far easier to beat because the zombies and objectives are easier to achieve with more abundant ammo.\n\nZombies are blessed with the ability to track humans, summon NPC zombies and direct zombie hordes.   Quite often the zombie players win if they are experienced and know how to ambush.  However if the humans are experienced then becoming a zombie is chore because the humans bunch at choke points...due to the fact that once a zombie is killed a certain number of times they become a spectator to the game.  So experienced players simply find an alley/corridor and wait.  They kill zombie attackers over and over forced into the alley until they become spectators then continue with the objectives.   The only way to win is hope that a new player is within the crowd and will make a mistake leading a gap in the team.\n\nBecause of the dev attitude, the team killing and the trolling, the game's user base has dwindled and you will often see the same 10-20 people hopping between servers some of which alleviate their boredom through trolling the levels to make them uncompletable.  Examples include stopping people from using critical elevators or preventing NPC characters from being rescued by leading them away from the exit zones.\n\nUnofrtunately the user base has also dwindled in part due to the shocking attitude of the developer Tatsur0.  I had read numerous reviews on Steam and on the gaming press about his attitude to paying customers but disregarded them.  However as the updates dragged out from weeks to months to over 9 months it was hard to accept his constant refutations to customers.   In the end a bug-riddled update was issued with new maps but missing promised weapons, skins and game modes which are apparently "coming soon".  The developer response on the forums is always "I promise nothing" and "Go play other games."\n\nPeople who criticised the developers were continually banned whilst trolls and team killers cannot be dealt with unless you supply video-evidence to the developers.\n\nDuring my supportive period I even wrote a lengthy strategy for the developers (I have launched several apps and work in App Development) about how to really engage the audience during updates and prevent users leaving.  It was so well received some of the gamers even said I should be hired.   The post was ignored with a response "We don't have time to do any of that stuff."   I shrugged that off and continued to pour time into the forums and the game.\n\nMy decision to exit the game came after Tatsur0 refused to acknowledge the fact that Windows 10 renders the game unplayable (no sound, stuttering).   After I flagged this and asked how many users were planning to take advantage of the free Windows upgrade my topic was flagged as spam (under the heading "Not relevant to Contagion") and the response was\n\n"Users know we don't support Windows 10 so Valve handle refunds."\n\nI cannot in good faith recommend that new users devote any kind of time to a game whose community has almost disappeared despite being a pretty good game.\n\nI honestly hope the Developers learn how to deliver a better customer service experience to the community that keep them in business.","August 4, 2015","false","84.7"," 548 of 652 people (84%) found this review helpful 23 people found this review funny","84","548","652","23","75"

( ͠° ͟ʖ ͡°)\n- System temperatures.\n- Gameplay bugs [survivors stuck into shelves....].\n- Phone map massive bug during splitscreen in extraction.\n- Badly programed ladders.\n- Very hard to handle melee weapons.\n- Zombies' exaggerated hits anticipation against the players.\n- Teamwork isn't possible considering you become a zombie when you die.\n- Achievements difficulty.\n\nTL;DR : Do not leave this game after playing a few seconds, it requires to play a lot of time to understand the engine, the bugs and usefull tips to win a game. I only play in splitscreen with a friend or in the solo mod. You should really play the solo for atleast 15 hours to train yourself and understand the subtlety of every game mod.\n\nThanks for the ones that read till the end.\nHere have a hug.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/razoleg/recommended/238430/","razoleg","Cunning Fox","http://steamcommunity.com/id/razoleg/","664 products in account","This is a draft review, I'll rewrite this word-hurricane later, treat it like a blueprint.\n\nThe game is late by about 8 years in terms of graphics, animations, gameplay and just about anything else you could name. It costs about $20, but for that you get about 3 coop maps and... 3-4 PvP maps. That's it! The game modes do not differ greately, except the coop ones of which there are two and they get boring rather quickly. Maps do change, but the routes are easily remembered, there are about three variations for each coop map, but if you ask me an occaisonally open door that was closed before does not make much of a difference, the tasks are varied but like I said only change twice or thrice per map.\n\nBut this isn't even the biggest problem. The worst flaw of the game is what is meant to be its selling point. The devs have made the multiplayer system so difficult and broken it is impossible to join your friends server (trust me I've spent 4 days trying every single solution on forums). The only way to do so is to download third-party programs like Hamachi and I have no intention to do that since I've had less problems joining in a 1999 System Shock 2. The devs are aware of this problem, but they don't want to fix it. Trust me, as I have spoken to them and they say they are denying any bit of constructive criticism. I think they are hinting at that "rent a server" feature instead. Pay-to-play? No thanks. And if you don't want a server and just want to play with your friends, be aware that numerous people will join as zombies 5 minutes before your escape in a 30 minute map and eat you and your friend alive, and they will pick your server out of about 500 empty ones available, yeah the community is nice too.\n\n(A link to the discussion: http://steamcommunity.com/app/238430/discussions/7/540743212111472871/)\n\nThis game is in development hell, essentialy you are buying about 5%-10% of what is promised. For this price, there has to be something like 50% more weapons, a campaign mode, 15-20+ maps, a working multiplayer, less bland characters that only differ slightly in voice and hand textures. But more than that, it should be somewhat playable because the balance is broken hopelessly (I'm talking about coop, since nobody buys these games for PvP), three guys vs. three zombies is an impossibility. In fact, one zombie player against 5 survivors gives the zombie about 70% chance of winning, as I have never seen zombies lose unless it's near the very end of the map. The maps are confusing, the directions are seriously broken, people spend 30 minutes trying to fight off zombies looking for an escape truck just to find it half-way through the map in a random detour.\n\n"Realistic" zombie games were the talk of early 00's and many mods were made for a number of them, some were free and more complete than this. If it came out then as a mod, I'd download it and spend maybe two nights for fun, but to pay for something like that in 2014 - no thanks.\n\nThe fact is, the game is hopelessly overpriced and late and devs need a reality check. It has no point and no outstanding feature, you begin to wonder as to what the actual point of makiing it was. It isn't realistic enough to be the Arma of zombie games, it's not arcade enough to be for ♥♥♥♥♥ and gigles like l4d, it doesn't have much content to brand it as something inbetween these two zombie extremes. My verdict - the game 's like a random bored zombie that won't even chase you after you poke it, you can just walk past.\n\nIf you do not believe a single word I've said, look at the percentage of people that have got the easiest achievements for this game. It's in the decimals for most of them, because I'd bet this game is "enjoyed" mostly over LAN by devs and their friends, and anyone like myself who likes to buy random stuff and make reviews knowing even before the purchase what the game will probably be like anyway.\n\nA little edit: there is a positive review up on the site, that is more popular. It was not removed, although it is early access, unlike reviews by Mantis and other people which were outright banned. Although I might see the logic that it was perhaps, not entirely about the game and more about the attitude of the development team, they were stating an opinion and so should not be banned. I don't see the devs removing the positive Early-Access reviews, so this is hardly fair.\n\nP.S. A few months later, upon mentioning my review in another negative one focusing on developer attitude I got a friend request from the developer himself.

For ten years I've waded through a horde of zombie games. Nothing emulated the raw feeling of isolation and cold that a gunshot in the distance or a scream or absolute silence can bring. We're all familiar with Brooks' original canon for zombies. Only headshots kill them. Eat flesh until they can't. Only sensory organs that have not been decayed or destroyed work. A moan causes others to moan, and they are attracted to the sound like a foghorn in the night. I never felt like I would truly find the zombie game that emulated this canon so perfectly. First there was Dead Rising - a close contender - followed by Dead Space [which opened a whole new can of worms] and Dead Island, which underperformed in basically every aspect. Left 4 Dead left a hollow feeling, mowing down thousands of zombies in a few hours seemed not worthwhile. Even DayZ left a bitter taste with its focus on player interaction and intense PVP, zombies were a secondary addition to the game and in their state of bugginess and all-out failure to function were hardly a threat to be feared for all but the newest players.\n\nFinally, though, finally. From the ashes of Zombie Panic! Source comes a developer prepared to emulate and yet transform the genre. Erasing waypoints with Google Maps on a cell phone and slaughtering the idea of overpowered zombies by balancing their frailty with disguise and scarce ammo, this game is reaching for the stars.\n\n\nContagion performs in ways I never thought I would see, genuinely. It strikes feelings of sudden and intense panic, a moan can send my heart pounding in my ears, praying it would be silent so I could hear which direction the zombie was coming from. A gunshot can bring hell's fury itself down on your head, while boarding up windows and doors can buy you time to escape. Zombies' interaction with the world largely seems to be directed by line of sight and various audio cues, which gives them a shambling and confused appearance. A slight trigger can send Zack coming at you, but a bullet in the wrong place can mean a bite, and a risk of infection. Incentivized by kill count and bragging rights, a human infected is unlikely to share this information with his teammates for fear of being shot on the spot. A group of humans prepared to fight off a horde of 50+ shambling corpses can easily be dissuaded by a misaligned headshot tearing off the jaw of a zombie and inspiring panic in the squad. A misplaced shotgun round can result in legless zombies crawling under the horde and into your lines. Brutality, free-for-all, and all out panic. All of it rings true of the first days of the Zombie apocalypse, and all of it brings a warm feeling of nostalgia to my heart, and hopeful eyes for the bright future where the Zombie genre isn't filled with crafting games, 8-bit indie ♥♥♥♥, and quick time events.\n\nEven the zombie player gameplay has merits. A helpfully designed "camouflage" button allows an inept player to disguise himself as he views his zombie in the third person and have control assumed by the AI. Moaning loudly can draw a horde, and in turn the moans of those zombies draw more, which can be lead to the human's hideouts and used to swarm them. A biting function has a high chance to infect humans, and watching your former counterparts murder each other for fear of infection in their hideout is rewarding in its own regard.\n\nI've never been so happy to realize a game was early access. After about 30-40 hours, I can easily see myself growing tired with this title and passing it into novelty, but it was well worth the 3$ spent. Call me nostalgia-blind, but there's so much potential content to see from these developers, and I'm very excited to be along for the ride.\n\n18/10, buy this and buy it for all your friends. This game will make history, and if it doesn't, I'll eat my shoe on livestream.","January 5, 2014","true","42.6"," 538 of 779 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","538","779","0","40"

This game currently only has 4 maps, a hand full of guns/weapons etc. so nothing major when it comes to variety at the moment. but like i have said before, this game is definitelly not finished and is updated regularly so there will be lots more maps and weapons.\n\nMy rating would be a 8.5. I would bump that up to a 9.2 when the bugs get patched and new maps and guns get added.\n\nOver all review is that I would most definitelly buy this game if your looking for a fun co-op fps/zombie survival game to play with friends and can wait for updates and put up with bugs.

It's really important to know what kind of zombie game this is before going in a game and expecting fast paced zombie killing. It is entirely a mix of fast paced zombie shooters mixed with the occasional waiting around to hold out.\n\nIf you are the type of player who enjoy constant shoot'em ups not having to worry about an ammo count and slashing your way through thousands of zombies... then go play Left 4 Dead. This game is not for you.\nHowever, if you enjoy games that require teamwork, conserving ammo, scavenging for supplies and using the limited resources around you then you should give this game a shot.\n\nI have found that the community in this game is alarmingly small, but the players have been surprisingly nice. The few that do play regularly will go out of their way to help newer players to expand and enlarge the community with more people.\n\nEvery gun and melee in the game has a certain feel to it, and I guarantee there will be at least one that can cater to your liking. The zombies lack a little diversity when it comes to the aesthetics, but have pretty unique ways of moving around and sneaking up on the survivors making gameplay pretty interesting in the long run. PvP mode is available which creates an even more intense and horror-filled experience added to the gameplay.\n\nAnd hey, there's free DLC coming with this game soon... so that's always a plus.\n\nPaying $20 for this game still does seem a little pricey to me, the amount of content offered seems to fall a little short of the price. Maybe buy the game when it goes on sale. Contagion really favors a more strategic crowd when it comes to fighting zombies, includes mature players and pretty decent graphics for a HL2 modification overall.","May 21, 2015","true","24.6"," 83 of 109 people (76%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","76","83","109","3","4"

I'm as much a loner in games as I am IRL. With that being said:\n\nThis is a great great great game! I suck at FPS, like really bad, but I LOVE zombies, so I buy just about every zombie game that looks worth while. I'm disapointed with some of them, say "meh.." on a few. But this one is great! As previously stated, I suck, so I played it on easy mode. I was expecting to just walk through the whole thing a few times and get the hang of it before upping the skill level.\n\nWell, I discovered that this game is so well balanced that even in the easiest mode, there where still just a few more bullets available than there where undead. The only way to survive was to use everything available and creep forward slowly. You can't go on a rampage and you can't get careless or you will die.\n\nGraphically, I'm impressed. At first, I was kind of put off by the chick player characters. The Skyrim Nexus has spoiled me. However. I soon realized that it didn't matter because all you see is their hands. The environment though - beautiful.\n\nThe music is stellar. It seems to flow seamlessly with what's going on in the game and it definitely sets the mood. It's that rare kind of music that you "feel" whether you want to or not.\n\nZombies and items are very well placed in game even though they seem to appear in different spots each time I played a level. The stiffs can and do get the drop on you because they can be sneaky. Plus, they can climb fences quickly, crawl under things and through holes. Many times it was dead silent and I turned around in a dark room to shine my flashlight in the face of one. I think I pooped a little.\n\nThe only bug I found (04NOV14), and I'll explain why I point it out, is that zombies cast shadows through walls sometimes. I am thankful for this and so are my pants. I point this out because it was the ONLY bug I found. Indi games are typically more pollished (in my experience) than major titles anyway. But this one is really, really nicely done. Not a single CTD, no magical things happening, very very very little clipping (zombies breaking down doors).. When I bought this game, I bought a finished product, and I'm thankful to the developers for that.\n\nI'll definitely be playing this game for a long time to come!\n\n[To the developers] Wonderful job people! Really. If you make another game that sounds like it's even remotely up my alley, I'll buy it without question!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ImSpartacus/recommended/238430/","ImSpartacus","=[BSID]= PFC ImSpartacus|:\\","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ImSpartacus/","155 products in account","I've put more than sixty hours into this game and Contagion's gameplay design is fundamentally broken. I want it to be good, but it's not. This breaks my heart because I know that a team spent many many manhours trying to make this into a cool game. I really wish it was a proper successor to ZPS.\n\nComing from around a thousand hours in ZPS, I was attracted to Contagion's "Escape" mode and I played this mode the most. There are other modes, but they are generally bland copycat "afterthoughts" that are done better in other games. Escape is the only mode that enticed me to get Contagion.\n\nHowever, Escape has numerous fundamental game design flaws that permanently gimp its gameplay. To illustrate, it's best to walk through a typical Escape game:\n\n"Escape" generally begins as a co-op mode with up to around 8 teammates. Initially, you're playing against only NPC zombies. However, the NPC zombies are completely boring to fight against. You either have boring citizen zombies that die to a single headshot or you have uninspiring bullet-sponge riot-armor zombies. I couldn't find any engaging strategy to defeat these bullet-sponges except repeated shots to the noggin. Therefore, the NPC zombies are more of a chore to fight through.\n\nEven though players soon find that the NPC zombies don't post much threat, the level design, itself, will kill them (either literally or figuratively):\n\n\nThere are simple "no no" level design decisions like the the frequent use of ladders. Since Contagion is built on Source, ladders are horrific and will literally get players killed without any zombie involvement (Even Valve wisely prefers to not use ladders in Source). When I completed Camp Whitner for the first time, I was led through by an experienced player (see showstoppingly confusing level design below) and he literally stops at one point to say, "Watch out, this ladder will kill you." I knew how Source ladders worked and carefully navigated down the shaft. My other inexperienced teammate did not and was instakilled by fall damage. The experienced player obviously knew about the trouble from that stupidly unnecessary ladder. I'm not sure how the developers could have so much experience with Source dating back to ZPS in 2007 and still not know that ladders are terrible level design.\n\nThere are also situations where the macro-scale level design pathing is so bad on certain maps that new players will just quit out of frustration. Maps like Barlow Square on Escape prematurely appear like easy-to-navigate "sandbox" urban "city" maps (awesome! right?). So at first you might go, "oh cool, that gun shop is a couple blocks west of our position. Let's make our way in that direction!" However, you have ZERO navigational liberty and you are FORCED onto a 100% LINEAR path due to miles of chainlink fence that procedurally block every path except ONE. This might only be "bad", but it moves to "terrible" when you find out that the dynamic path is often obscurred and basically hidden. If you are a new player that isn't aware that there's exactly one path to move through the map, then you will quickly get confused, then frustrated, then you'll quit. This happens on a painfully regular basis. The zombies don't end their fun - it's the map's level design that does that.\n\nFurthermore, there are micro-scale level design issues. The latest example is one that I just experienced this morning.\nI was trying to beat Montclair with some equally inexperienced players and we got to a military medical base in a park. After easily clearing it of boring NPC zombies, we walked past a locked gate and we were told to go find the key in the park. We didn't know what this "key" looked like, but we combed the park nevertheless. We came up with nothing, yet we kept looking for what felt like hours. It got so desparate that the player-controlled zombie started trying to help us find it. Eventually my only living partner turned into a zombie as a result of a random bite and I just quit to end that pitiful match. This is one example of how needlessly frustrating this game is. Stuff like this is simply unfun.\nBut if you manage to get through all of those inherent level design flaws, then you'll notice that player-controlled zombies are frighteningly unbalanced. It gets so bad, that some experienced players intentionally die at the beginning of the match just so they can single-handedly destroy their former teammates before they can even get through the first couple objectives. How in the world can it be so unbalanced?\n\nIt's almost impossible to hit a player zombie as compared to an identical NPC zombie. I've heard players claim that player zombies have unique hitboxes. My hunch is that the game has poor networking and it's normally masked by allowing NPC zombie hits to be credited only clientside (versus player zombie hits that must be validated serverside). Either way, this is a very very very noticeable phenomena and it makes player zombies very difficult to deal with.\n\nOh and player zombies can "dodge" as well. The experienced ones know that if their head stays unscathed, then they can tear through a group of players, so they spin, duck, jump and do all sorts of stupid moves to turn themselves into a walking killing machine. That's not fun. This is not a featured capability. There's no tooltips or tutorials that explain all of the intricacies of this maneuvering. That tells me that it isn't a designed feature. And since it ruins entire Escape servers, I say it's an exploit that is unpatched two years after release.\nI really drive home hard enough that this is a frustrating game to play. If I hadn't dropped a thousand hours in ZPS, I would've abandoned it long ago. This game does not play like ZPS. It's something much much worse and that breaks my heart.","December 26, 2015","false","62.2"," 43 of 56 people (77%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","77","43","56","2","2"

I loved the gameplay and feel, but the full release actually seriously downgraded the graphics and character models, and movement feels much worse now. I innitially was very excited for the "Escape" mode and played the 1 map they had to death and back. On full release there is.... 1 more map. Actually, it is the same map as a Beta one, just repurposed for "Escape" mode.\n\nThe difficulty setting means nothing as far as I can tell. On normal I had a lot of ammo I thought, but died miserably about 20 minutes later after finding little more than a box of pistol ammo and an old shotgun with a couple rounds in it. As for the horde of 100+ zombies outside that will follow you no matter how far you run or hide from them, they tore me to shreds moments later. This brings me to another fault of the full version. NO ammo (and I have yet to have a single melee weapon spawn) or FAR TO MANY zombies. There is no balance since the undead can auto track and lock on to you.\n\nAs for my skill, every shot (minus one or two when a zombie stealth sneaks behind me) is a headshot. MOST of the time, this is a kill, and other times it takes 4-5 shots to the head to bring one down. Still, if the game lets me have a good run and the hit boxes are in my favor I can get 99% single shot kills. Still, I run out of ammo and end up being swamped by a horde despite checking every nook and cranny for guns and ammo.\n\nCharacter models now look TERRIBLE! Seriosly, there is something badly wrong with their faces and the textures/models seem to be between Half Life 1 and 2 for quality, while the zombies all look good still. Gore is alright, but the zombies make NO NOISE at all when they walk and make the exact same noise as a door breaking when they die/fall.\n\nBefore the "full release", I would have rated it a 8/10 with high hopes as it only needed more maps beyond the police station. Now? I would say 2 or 3/10, and that is being generous.","April 17, 2014","false","36.8"," 395 of 653 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","395","653","2","13"

When you die, you turn zombie. Here's the bad part, when you die 5 times in a round, you go to spectate mode. No way to respawn, you don't get to come back until next round!

You also may think "I'll join another server." Well, the game is basically dead. At any given time, there's maybe 3 active servers per map. So technically, there's more servers than people.

There are typically no more than 50 people in the WORLD playing. Additionally, player zombies are extremely unbalanced and ruin co-op modes. When human players die in any game mode (co-op or PvP), they become zombies and wreak havoc on the remaining survivors. The fact that they make little or no noise, can move sporadically (combined with bad hit boxes), can lead and command up to 15 AI zombies, and have many respawns with no wait timer make them almost always unstoppable in the end. They should really only be in the Hunted game mode.\n\nI also dislike that you cannot view the server list while already in a server. Further, you cannot even vote to kick/ban players or even to change the map.\n\nPositive aspects: The developers put very much detail in the maps. There are many pathways and hidden areas, requiring exploration (and teammwork if playing co-op). The game also succeeds in the horror aspect, especially in Hunted mode.","May 14, 2015","false","94.8"," 91 of 147 people (62%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","62","91","147","4","3"

Some work is being done as gibbing on zombies, breakable doors and even one more map is released. However melee combat for humans is FYBAR. It's just even more horrible that before. I don't get it why they refused to use HL2MP default model and put something self-made. As soon as zombie get's in a melee range it's impossible to hit it either with pistol/revolver or with a melee attack - it just jumps around you. Same applies to a situation when you are out of ammo - melee weapon will cause more troubles because you think it will work. It won't, sadly. It's broken for 5 months long since initial beta release and haven't changed a bit in a positive way.\n\n-----\n\nQuite a let down for a team who created Zombie Panic: Source. Graphically it looks fairly good for an ye olde Source engine and custom sound engine does it's work really good. There are only 4 maps for now: one is co-op objective and three for Hunted (deathmatch) game mode. Also there is a extraction game mode but it's getting old pretty fast. So does the whole game.\n\nBut the problem is not in that there are few maps, rather strange recoil and jittery 3-rd person animations. The major problem is that word 'boring' does not fully describe playing Contagion as a zombie. While some features (like glow and outlines are being added) are being worked on, lack of features like mini-map or zombie shortcuts/paths for faster map navigation making that experience painful. Try playing on objective map as a zombie and you'll want to leave server quite fast because hanging around mindlessly over a huge map is not fun by any means. If you somehow find a way to survivors you have nothing extra that makes player controlled zombie better than a AI zombie. But being a human is no better. Somehow, Monochrome made a co-op game without most co-op related features. Really, all you need your buddies for is to carry a key? In fact, a some kid could get one and do not know it, so co-op progress will halt as other players even do not know who got a valuable co-op items!\n\nLastly, developers do not fix critical bugs and adjust game play mechanics as fast as I'd like to see in a multiplayer only game. They do regular content updates (like Halloween and X-mas updates) thought.\n\nAs for now, it's hardly a game I'd recommend to anyone due to it's gameplay. It's really gets boring after 2-5 hours of play. Pretty picture, neat sounds and randomized fences/ locked doors alone just can't keep the gameplay up.\nZombie Panic: Source is still a much better game. And it's free.\n\nP.S. I've backed Contagion on Kickstarter and played the game before most other players. I will update my review tone if anything will change in a positive way.","November 28, 2013","false","11.6"," 200 of 346 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","200","346","0","31"

I know I'll waste my time waiting for it to load, but I'm going to try. Maybe something lucky will happen and I'll find some people to talk to. This game is to inactive to be fun anymore. Oh wait, I forgot I uninstalled it. I remember me and a few other survivors grouping up in one room hoping we could survive the swarms of walkers. I remember playing with friends on this game. It was good but not anymore.","April 16","false","34.5"," 22 of 29 people (76%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","76","22","29","3","0"

Note that I'm just playing the co-op mode, and the perspective is based on that:\n-Objectives are written in a first-person perspective, relying on character knowledge the player doesn't have.\n-Equipment is scarce to the point of being bizarre.  Sure, you don't expect there to be ammo lying all over the place, but things like melee weapons are just as scarce, despite every location being littered with items you could use as a melee weapon.\n-Characters often comment on using itmes on doors that aren't supposed to open, leading you to frustratingly use keys on each and every door you come across to find the one that will finally open.\n-There's next to no feedback on the weapons and the type of ammo they should be using.  Sure, you'd expect  a bunch of strangers to not necessarily know everything about weapons they find, but it really doesn't feel like the intention of the game, considering you get the names of all the guns.  You don't have any feedback on the ammo you pick up either - how much of the shotgun shells do you have when you don't have a shotgun?  Your guess is as good as mine.\n-Melee doesn't have the kind of impact you would expect - especially with something like a Sledgehammer.  There's no real feeling of force when you attack someone with a large weapon - leaving the whole experience rather unsatisfying.\n\nIt's not unplayable or anything.  It's just really bizarre.  While I appreciate the slower, careful pace compared to a game like Left4Dead, the lack of polish really gets in the way of a really good time.\n\nShame too.  There's potential here.  This game really should still be in early access.","June 21, 2014","false","2.7"," 90 of 151 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","90","151","0","11"

But since I do not think it's a yes then I have to choose no.\n\nThis game has way too many flaws to recommend which is a shame because I think it expanded on Left 4 Dead by adding different types of game modes and being able to ADS.\n\nThe biggest problem with the game is that it crashes all the time. If you finish a game and decide to switch to another server "crash". If you are waiting for the next round "crash". It crashes at least once every game session I have with it. I have friends who play and it happens to them also.\n\nThe other problem are bugs/glitches in the game. For example, in extraction mode survivors can get stuck and will not move, even if you tag them to follow you. I've had this happen on numerous occasions. Other times they just get stuck on ladders and you have to go all the way back when you realize they're not following you to tag them to unfollow then tag to follow again but take a different route so they don't get stuck on ladders again. Another problem with extraction is the route to lead the survivors doesn't always show up on the phone. So you're left wondering which way to go. Then there are glitches where you get stuck yourself and basically have to kill yourself to get free.\n\nOther issues are gameplay issues. There is no mini-map. I don't have a huge problem with the concept of not having it except you have no idea what to do and where to go on a bunch of maps. The hints on the phone aren't helpful. For example on Roanaoke PD there are a couple of escape routes in the game. I'm not going to give anything away except that once you find the armory it doesn't tell you what to do next so you're left roaming around until you get somewhere that triggers the next hint. Obviously after you've played it you now know but for new players they'll have no idea and this is a long play session map. It's just annoying. If there were at least arrows or something to point you in the right direction that would be helpful.\n\nWhile I do enjoy playing this game with friends, I think until some of these major issues are fixed I can't recommend this game. Some of these have been complained about for a long time so odds are this game isn't going to be improved. If you get it on a cheap sale it might be worth it otherwise there are better zombie games out there.","March 5","false","42.3"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","14","15","0","0"

It didn't need a bunch of bells and whistles, I just wanted it to be fun. Unfortunately the few times I've played it has been either boring, frustrating, and/or tedious.\n\nThe ammo seems to be a bit random, the first playthrough was fine. The ammo was a little scarce, but as long as you played slightly conservatively it wasn't a problem. The last 2 times playing the ammo was basically nil. I spent most of the game just running around the zombies because I didn't want to waste ammo (or using a bat)....and yet after 40 minutes of playing, my friend and I had only picked up 3 ammo total. Funnily enough one of the places we had to go to was a gun and ammo shop that we were supposed to "stock up" on to prepare for the level...and yet there was only one thing of ammo and every single weapon at the place had no ammo. That kept happening, I picked up 7 or 8 guns in a row  throughout the playthroughs which were ALL out of ammo and nothing to be picked up. It just became frustrating.\n\nAnother big complaint I have is that the maps are generally quite big, yet several areas have absolutely nothing in them (besides zombies). There are lots of deadends and places that just serve no purpose at all other than to make the map look bigger. You have to search for a single item or location, yet the maps are so big that it just feels incredibly tedious making progress/finding items in the game. You go to one location, are told to find said item, have to go to the other side of the map to grab the item, then go back to the inital location to activate it or trigger something, and so the cycle continues.\n\nThen in my most recent playthrough my friend and I were stuck for about an hour. We couldn't understand how we were possibly missing something, had gone through every single room and location at least three or four times. Finally we googled a walkthrough, and turns out that a door that was supposed to be triggered opened just didn't work. It glitched out for some reason, we rewent through the steps (that we previously had done correctly) and nothing would fix it, so we were just about to quit out of the game...when it crashed. That basically sums up how well my experience has been when it comes to Contagion.","March 5","false","3.7"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","15","18","2","1"

It's absolutely not worth $20. There are only 6 or so maps, and half of them are long big maps, and the other half can't really be considered "maps" at all because they're just a single house or two and you hold out against wave after wave of zombies. Yawn.\n\nOverall, the game just feels unpolished, like not a lot of effort was put into it. After about 3 hours, I felt like I had seen everything there was to see.\n\nIt's also pretty misleading. Their intro video mentions how ammo and guns are found in logical places - no they're not. Wrecked humvees will have gun cases and crates strewn all around with no ammo/weapons (you can't open anything except doors) but go into a women's bathroom and you'll find sniper ammo in the sink. There's lots of random nonsense like that which completely takes away the immersion and survival aspects the game claims in it's marketing.\n\nSo overall, a pretty disappointing game. It's not terrible, and if you're playing it PvP with a group of friends, you can get some laughs out of it for a few hours. But it just feels like a mediocre Half-Life mod. Your lights have an annoying "camera grunge" effect that we couldn't figure out how to turn off. The animations don't seem to have any blending, so they look awful. Your arms that hold the guns look strange and contorted, very unnatural. It's just a mediocre, unpolished game.

However, there was no indication of game being not finished.\nI was actually hoping to see the complete release version when I was buying the game without "Early Access" warning (which they removed because, apparently, beta equals release).\n\nI find this to be misleading adverstment and a foul play to trick players into buying this game and this is a one huge reason to consider twice before buying any other possible titles published by Monochrome.\n\nAnimations are hideous, sounds are acceptable and gameplay is basicly boring and repetative.\nOficial hosted servers feature the difficultues above normal as rarely as dragons borns to this world and, believe me, normal difficulty is not challenging at all. Yet the game allows you to host your very own little server with ability of minimal management of it.\n\nGame still develops, but yet again - I was hoping to play a bloody complete game. Therefore, I do not recommend to buy this game or other future possible titles of this publisher just because of the way they treated the steam community with this one.\n\nAlso, what is going on with "indie" being placed on every single title published by amateurs?\nIndie is not an indicator of how developers were poor while developing the game. Indie is not about consuming the fast food while developing your little toy. Indie is not about begging the community for money at kickstarters or whatever.\n\nIndie stands for independence. The ability to manifest your very own and your very original view on something in your game. Contagion was contaminated with community at alpha. This is not an indie game - developer depends on playerbase.\n\nThis is just bold daylight robbery.\n\nAwesome-o, your comment is very inaccurate and is full of false and misleading information.\n\nThe game is no longer in "Early Access"\nI know, right? That is the main point of this review.\n\nthe animations are really good because they utilise the source engine effectively\nNope, they are not. You can take a look at cinematic SFM release trailer as a sample of animations and I really doubt that a living being is able to perform such oddities. In game reloading, moving and head bobbing (which failes to turn off when turned off in options for\nsome reason) are awful.\nWith same success I may "utilise the whole collection of my crayons effectively" to draw a doodle on my wall.\n\nThis game will always be "in development"\nAnd I really hope that it will be in development for, at least, two more years.\nFull release and exit from the Early Access status usually means that all or most of planned features were implented in game. A good developers adds the minimal ammount of bugs to this checklist as well.\nThis is clearly not a case here. I own this game for few months already and I keep receiving 250MB-400MB updates from time to time.\nThis game is crawling with game breaking bugs.\nThe day I bought this game I had no sounds at all available in game, which was reported by many other users as well.\nIn same version survivors were able to climb on the weapon's shop on Barlove Square, where no zombie could reach them.\nIn same version survivor could be trapped inside the objective without ability to leave it in rescue game mode.\nIn same version zombies had 8 audio files, which makes approximetly 20% of current zombie sounds.\nIn same version boltcutters/keys failed to drop from the deceased survivor, which made it impossible to complete the escape game mode.\nIn same version it was possible to delay the infection by allowing the zombie to bite you again, while pressing the movement button.\n\nDoes not sounds like a good experience, eh?\nSome of them were fixed in recent 200MB patches, some are still available for experiencing and dozens of new ones are added each patch.\n\nBloody hell, they are still adding the maps (which are very few for now) and game mods after the "full release"!\nContagion is and always will be an indie game because the devs published the game themselves.\nYour definition of indie game is poor and incomplete.\nAssassin's creed black flag is indie game then because it was developed by Ubisoft Montreal and published by Ubisoft.","May 10, 2014","false","20.0"," 63 of 106 people (59%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","59","63","106","2","6"

Needs either Hamachi, NeoRouter, Evolve, Tunngle, or router/firewall portforwarding/port unblocking wizardry to work at all, let alone well.\n-No Linux dedicated server.  Most dedicated server establishments are built on Linux owing to the expense of getting a Windows license, not to mention the fact that the best place for a Windows system is behind a heavily-fortified firewall.\n-In light of the above, the price on a game this modern might scare off others.  Were this in GoldSrc, I'd give it a pass.  Not this time.\n\nA mixed bag, but the best time to pick up this game is when it has a very steep discount applied to it, i.e. during seasonal and "special event" sales.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/WongChin/recommended/238430/","WongChin","Wong","http://steamcommunity.com/id/WongChin/","70 products in account","[Skip to the verdict if you want a short summary]\nWhat is contagion?Contagion is a first person zombie horror game created by Monochrome LLC and running on the source engine in which you play one of eight characters who have to survive in a zombie ridden world. At the moment there is four main gamemodes which are Hunted, Escape, and Extraction. In hunted you experience tense Pvp battles with players online whilst at the same time fighting off zombies and scavenging for supplies and ammo. In escape you follow objectives sent to you via an ingame phone to escape (as the name suggests) the area you are currently in. This is my personal favourite gamemode for an atmospheric horror experience! And finnally: in extraction you have to help rescue Ai by taking them from one side of the map to the other via a Gps on your in-game phone.\n\nThe loveThe main thing I love about this game is the atmosphere; every second and every turn is an intense moment. Most of my time playing this game I spend with my heart beating rapidly as I brace myself for a zombie encounter. This atmosphere is mainly brought on by the difficulty which comes from the random infection chance when hit from a zombie meaning any damage could be fatal and also the scarcety of ammo. The maps in these game are truly amazing. The game feautures a system which randomizes the map everytime so you will be experiencing a new adventure with each playthrough. Aswell as this the maps feauture tight spaces and lots of corners which adds a cloustrophobic ephect of if you see a zombie: your more or less going to have a heart attack. Whilst talking about the maps I feel the need to mention the amazing soundtrack and also sound effects used within the game which make up for the mediocre voice acting. These two things combined mean that you will feel as though you are actually there walking through those tight halways listening for the rumble of a nearby zombie. The graphics on this are what I would expect for a game of this type; not astounding but they dont need 4k graphics to give me a true horror experience. Moving on, within the options menu we have a wide variety of options to customize our experience and to provide the needs of those with a microwave computer, which is what I would expect for a non-port. A small mention I am going to give because I think it could be a good feauture but hasnt been used to its full advantage yet is the workshop support. This alows people to make custom maps and zombies which could bring the horror to a whole new level. So far not much good content has surfaced but I have high hopes for the future. Now onto the multiplayer side of things: you can join a random hosted server via a search from the main menu after selecting your desired map and gamemode. This means you can either play co-op or the mode named hunted in which players converse in heart renching pvp battles and fight to the death. I feel this gamemode is a really nice addition to the game but I feel it is lacking some larger maps. The main thing that seperates this game from other zombie games though; is the infection feature. This means that when you get hit by a zombie there is a chance of you becoming infected and being a zombie. Signs of this is the noise slowly distorting and the colours on your screen slowly fading. This adds a really cool aspect of the game which gives you the choice of whether to tell your friends that you are becoming infected or sneakily bite them while they are not looking! I feel this adds a new dimension to the co-op  gameplay. Also if you die during a game you will respawn as a zombie which I think is good because it rids the game of a boring spectator mode. Time to talk about my favourite feature in the game: the co-op. There is nothing more fun then hoping intom a game of escape with my friends and experiencing the horror together. It also adds a lightheartened twist to the game. Finnally I am going to mention that a free Dlc has just been released containing a new gamemode, some new maps, charecters and weapons. I think it is good that the developers are still supporting their game and I hope to see more things like this in the future.\n\nThe hateSomething I dont like in this game is theHud though this is mainly prefrence and is not game breaking. I just feel that the Hud feels like some 90's shooter and isn't very polished. Mainly the wapon slots in the top right corner. But as I said tis is just preference. My main problem with the game is the terrible Ai. It is truly unpredictable: sometimes the human ai will walk into walls and sometimes they will do as meant. Sometimes the zombies will chase after you and sometimes they will stare into space. I just feel this ruins the immersion and otherwise perfect atmosphere. Another problem is that the deddicated servers are not very reliable and thematchmaking is pretty appalling. This can be avoiced by sticking to hamatchi co-op like I do. But I feel like I am missing a big chunk of the game witrhout hunted which would be hard to play on hamatchi unless I had alot more friends. Something that is a minor problem is the lack of story. I say this is minor because the game doesnt really need a story because all you really need to know is that you are getting away from the zombies but I just felt like a small chunk of the game was missing for me. Another thing that isnt really bad but some people could find bad is that the game is very slow paced and you are not just running at hordes of zombies with a chainsaw. Im saying this could be bad because some people may expect this from a zombie game. My final complaint is a few small bugs such as when you scroll down the texts on your phone by left clicking: you cant scroll back up. These bugs are minor and can probably be easily fixed so Im not to salty about them.\n\nThe verdictContagion is an atmospheric zombie horror that will have your heart beating rapidly but dont go in expecting a fast paced run and gun. A definite buy if you have a co-op partner.\n\nLove:\n+Atmosphere\n+Co-op multiplayer\n+Difficulty\n+All around good graphics\n+Options\n+Worshop support\n+Infection\n+Free content\n\nHate\n-Bad dedicated servers\n-Hud\n-Bad Ai\n-Some bugs\n-No story\n\n7/10\n\nThank you for reading, if you enjoyed don't forget to:\nJoin my curator group!\nVisit my website![axlshack.wordpress.com]\nWatch me on youtube!","June 15, 2015","true","20.1"," 24 of 36 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","24","36","0","0"

Progressing through the game's levels seems to alternate between insta-killing every zombie running at you with headshots from a mile away (this works with almost any weapon, so there's really no point to carrying other weapons aside from using the separate ammo) and being swarmed and quickly killed in tight quarters by either a huge swarm that spawned in thanks to an ending sequence or one of the armored zombies.\n\nThere's extremely little in the ways of avoiding/stealthing/distracting and the melee combat has no weight at all (zombies will continue to run at you at full speed while you attack them, so you'll just be constantly running backwards while slowly chipping away at their health), so I never felt like the game gave me any choice or variety.\n\nThe netcode was a problem in the majority of servers I played (leading to unreliable combat), the player zombie mechanic is frustrating rather than an interesting challenge, and there's almost no mechanics that reward or even acknowledge co-operative play. Medical supplies or other interesting items that could be used to help other players are extremely rare, and covering/protecting teammates is mostly a non-problem in the linear campaign levels, where you will most likely be funneling everyone, including the zombies, through single doorways and alleyways to be shot/slapped with your gun.\n\nI wanted to like this game from the start, when I bought it on early access, and I love the art design, but it all feels wasted in one of the blandest zombie/co-operative games I've ever played. I don't think anything short of a complete redesign of the game mechanics could get me back into this game again.\n\n\nEDIT 11/28/15:\n\nI have a lot of changes to make to this review, such as looking at some of the newer maps and some of the content I missed. I'll start on the revisions when the 'Flatline' game-mode has been released.","May 17, 2015","false","74.7"," 31 of 49 people (63%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","63","31","49","2","0"

The game is a nice zombie survival shooter, even though it has it's share of bugs and glitches it still offers a great experience.\n\nStory\n=======\n\nThe story is a little fuzzy when you start, you pick from a group of survivors and shoved in the middle of a zombie outbreak.  In most game modes you are given instructions through your phone by a unknown individual helping you escape the area but of course you need to complete certain tasks let it be taking out a fire to holding a location for a bit. There is of course a few pieces in some of the maps that hint what is going on, as more content comes out the more players will understand or piece together a story about the zombie outbreak.\n\nThe developers have also started a comic series free on their site to tell more about the story. It's rather interesting and shows a bit more about the outbreak. It's worth the read.\n\nGameplay\n=======\n\nThe gameplay breaks down to modes  and humans vs zombies.\n\nMode 1 = Escape\n\nThis mode is pretty much the story driven type, as you start the map you will be thrown at the start location , from there you follow the text messages on your phone and complete tasks that will lead to your freedom. However there are a few twists, for one if you play online anyone that is killed will become a zombie creating a hard situation to deal with as they are a bit faster and annoying :P , second the objective path will change each round for example one route will have you go through a gun store to the gas station where the next round will get you to enter a threatre and push towards the bank. This randomness adds a bit more fun and reply value to enjoy.\n\nMode 2 = Hunted\n\nYour shoved in the middle of a free for all. All humans are against each other nothing else matters, ammo is everywhere as well as guns so go out and murder your fellow humans because hey the world is over anyways. Remember though ...everyone you kill will become a zombie that might end up helping you become the last survivor or could be your undoing and lead to your demize.\n\nMode 3 = Extraction\n\nYou are randomly thrown to one of many spawn locations on the map, you may be with fellow survivors if you play online or by yourself. Your mission is straight forward head to a random location which you will find npc survivors needing help, you need to hold the location for a set amount of time then extract them...just remember the further you complete the objectives the more zombies start spawning at the next location one and anyone that dies will become a zombie and are forced to try and stop you from saving those npcs.\n\nMode 4 = Panic\n\nI can't say much for this one as I haven't been able to find a room for it. It looks rather interesting.\n\nHumans vs Zombies =\n\nHuman players have the ability to use melee weapons , guns , med kits and special items such as bolt cutters and keys to progress their story. Humans also have the ability to instant kill zombies with their melee weapon if they sneak behind a zombie which is nicely shown with a kill animation. Humans also have the ability to turn into zombies if they take enough damage or meet the random chance of luck.....as time passes your screen will become grey and your sound will become very quiet until the final moment of your scream in which you turn into those you have been killing this whole time.\n\nZombie players are nothing special, they aren't L4D special zombies where they take damage or dry hump the survivors to death. When you think about they are very weak, one shot to the head and your dead. However player zombies do have some abilities, one is roar which allows you to call near by zombie npcs to your aid, they will follow you and also you can give them a waypoint to charge. Zombies can also jump, crawl , break down doors and grab players biting them and giving them a chance to join your rank by infection.\n\n\n\nOverall\n=====\n\nThe game is something different , at times it does feel like the mod No room in hell which is a good thing. The concept and direction of where the game is aiming is awesome however there are many issues such as zombies getting stuck to players abusing broken mechanics such as throwing keys or cards under desks or objects that will force players to a halt as they can't progress forward . The story is also non-existence until the comics came out but then again what zombie game really has the full picture as the concept of a zombie outbreak is always based on the idea of pure chaos and pieces of information which does work out.\n\nShould you buy it\n============\nFor coop = Yes it's rather fun and enjoyable\nFor singleplayer = Not really worth it as it becomes very dry after the second run.\nFor PVP = if you can get into the 20 player servers it can get pretty crazy and fun. But if your just going for pvp and not big on coop then might want to wait until a sale day.\n\nFinal Remark:\n\nMy fellow survivor decided to be a jerk by taking all the ammo for everytime of weapon even the ones he didn't have....so I decided to show him the reason why not to be greedy by dragging a mob of zombies into one room which killed me and then grabbed another mob and fellowed the survivor....the end was rather enjoyable as he finally understood that a bathroom wasn't the safest place to hide during a zombie outbreak.","October 7, 2014","true","64.1"," 26 of 41 people (63%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","63","26","41","5","0"

As I type this it's on sale for $5  and it has been cheaper  even here on Steam when I bought it for $3.74   it's also been similary priced on the humble store for $4.    So know that the game has and no doubt will be again cheaper if you're on a tight budget.   The standard asking price of $20 is absurd though and is clearly priced high soley to make it appealing during large Steam sales.\n\nThe game has two major modes.  One being a Co-op where you have to advance through the map doing objectives while trying to not become zombie lunch.  This mode is the best the game has to offer but it's not great.   The generic gameplay  gets old quite fast so hopefully whomeever you are playing with (and god help you if you actually bother to play alone) better be a rather amusing friends.   Otherwise once you play a map once there is little reason to ever play it again even though objectives are  somewhat randomized each time.     The game is terribly easy except if one of you actually manages to die.   If that occurs they get a few zombie lives and  this is where diffaculty steps up, player zombies are a actual threat and likely your team will be wiped out due to them in many cases.   This also causes trolls to get themselves killed to disrupt the game as early as possible.  These types of players are not overly common but do exist.\n\nThen there is the PVP mode which is just god awful.  It mostly consists of players trying to camp  and a few being brave enough to hunt the others down.  The phone can be used as a method of  playing hot and cold  which will give away other players positions.  Why do you have the numbers of everyone you are trying to hunt? Who knows, but while this may sound like a neat feature it also serves as a warning to the camper that the threat is coming.    Again with the majority of players prefering to camp this causes the brave hunters to often die because killing 4 campers one after enough tends to get you shot a few times during the fire fights.  It's a terrible game design.   Likewise however if you die you become a zombie and can try to get some  brain flavored revenge.... or cheat...  You see the game has another issue when friends play together it doesn't take long before they realize the zombie can help their buddy human.   So lets say the human is camping in a room with 1 entrance  the zombie can sit just outside and call NPC zombies to gather keep calling them keeps the zombies with him making  a zombie protective shield  for thier friend and attacking any player that comes and you'll know their coming because they will no doubt be using the noisy phone.\n\nBeyond game-play  the sound is generic, and the graphics are heavily aged because they decided to go with the Source engine.  A great engine sure even more so in its prime but we see other indie games looking better or having unique art styles to comensate this just once again decides to be bland.    There are just too many games today to choose from that do this genre better, some of them even free like No More Room in Hell.   So there's no reason to buy this game at the end of the day.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/skillless/recommended/238430/","skillless","Peashooter","http://steamcommunity.com/id/skillless/","238 products in account","Many of my friends and I are into zombie co-op games, so naturally Contagion is one of the titles which we would try on. Before I begin on descirbing the game itself, the first thing I would like to mention is that the number of people on my friend list who has the game, which is 21, is higher than the number of total players currently in game at the time I am writing this review. So, unless you can find yourself a good team (this is an 8 player co-op zombie killing game), please be prepared to face zombie hordes yourself. There will be one or two players in certain servers, but they will most likely leave half way or rambo about and turn into a zombie before you can realize what is going on. You will be real luckly if you can meet a quality player or two in any server. Truth to be told, this game has seen better days in terms of player count.\n\nThere are some merits to the game itself. First of all, as a realistic zombie apocalypse co-op game, the game is rather well-made, graphically speaking. The game itself uses the source engine, so expect something along the line of Left 4 Dead. The game mechanism is rather simple and bare, so as to make sure that you don't get too much on-screen help. There will only be a health and stamina bar; you can carry 4 items of all types, some essential in solving in-game quests; you will only be able to see the silhouettes of items when you go near them. Realism, so yes, that's all you get. The enemies are simpler as well, as there will only be two types of zombies, one the normal ones where you can kill with a bullet in the head, if you are able to place it there accurately that is. The other is a "riot police" zombie, which soaks a lot more lead before you can kill it. Bullets are as scarce as they are sacred in the game, so think before you shoot if you can help it. Oh and you won't have a crosshair so you will need to depend on iron sights unless you are using a shotgun.\n\nHaving said all that, the game itself is really not bad, though there are major problems elsewhere. Firstly, this game has a poor finishing. In the game I was playing before writing this review (and left because I was alone and I got overran halfway), I was pushed down a ladder by a zombie. That wasn't the problem, the problem is that, after being pushed down and suffering some dammage, my gun model disappeared! It won't be much of a problem if this is another game, but do not forget that Contagion does not offer any corsshair. So, what happened is that, I can't use my iron sight because the model has disappeared! The problem was solved by switching to another item (a card-key) and back, but shouldn't this bug be fixed at some point? Also, I have had issues with map skins. I was playign an official map and all reflective surfaces (and glasses) turned cyan after I did some alt-tabbing. You will know that vision is real important in this game if you are familiar with it, and it is not a simple matter of being irritating when glasses turn into solid cyan. If you can't see what's behind, hordes can close in a lot easier. Trust me, it's fatal.\n\nAnd did I mention that zombies tend to get stuck a lot? Yeah, though I am not complaining.\n\nAlso, let's not forget that Contagion has an extremely weak game community. There's just a handful of players here and there, and there really isn't much of a back-up community to support the game. Not much custom maps, same old boring official maps with the same quests again and again, it gets repetitive. There are some die-hard fans, though most of the players I met are those who came back after a year or so to clear everything again, and then leaving it to gather dust in the vitural game shelf. I am one of them.\n\nSo, my final words will be that, do not get the game unless you know what is going on and what you will be expecting. You'll most likely enjoy a lone adventure for an hour, maybe with a random teammate or two who has 300 ping, and then grow bored with it pretty soon. Nothing too fancy about this game that is worth the money.","July 31, 2015","false","17.0"," 15 of 22 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","15","22","0","2"

This game is hands down one of my favorite video games *ever*, and not without reason.  I'll split this review into three sections:\n\nThe Co-op Game Modes\n\nCo-op is IMO, one of the weaker aspects of the game, but even then manages to be pretty good, if co-op is your thing.  Extraction is my favorite of the two team modes, where you must find survivors hiding in their homes, defend them from zombies, and get them to the edge of the quarantine zone.  The sheer number of zombies pressing in on whatever stronghold you happen to be in is enough to cause panic at the worst of times.  Add the zombies ability to climb into the mix, and often you'll watch a friend as a hungry mouth stretches through a window to bite him.\n\nThe NPC survivors are admittedly not the brightest, but it's nothing game breaking.\n\nPVP- The Hunt\n\nI know that Contagion is primarily marketed as a co-op game.  Do yourself a favor, and play the pvp.  It's the best.  Playing with friends makes it better than the best, weather you team up and destroy the opposition, or just save a bullet for them.  The gamemode is last man standing, with players scavenging for weapons and ammo while hunting each other and avoiding the undead.\n\nThis mode is a beautiful mix of stealth and combat, chasing and hiding.  Each weapon has it's own niche, and even the weaker ones are often so cool that you can't help but use them.  You are forced to make choices on the fly as you hunt your prey, but do your best not to be trapped by the roving hordes.  Any gunshot alerts the dead to your location, and players can easily deduce it too by watching the movement patterns of the horde.\n\nHeadshots are always an instant kill, with the exception of the sig, which is an instant kill 90% of the time.  Choosing between spraying with your assault rifle or taking a careful shot with a crossbow to avoid making noise is the lifeblood of this game.\n\nGeneral gameplay\n\nI struggled not to mention most of this stuff throughout the rest of this review, as it factors into everything else.  Too make it short and to the point:\n\nMelee- Simply amazing.  Swings take chunks out of zombies and snap their bodies in the direction of your blow.  Make sure to aim for the head.  Against players, one hit is usually enough to down them, but it's difficult to get in close.\n\nGunplay- Each gun has a perfect feel and balance based on it's type.  Admittedly, in the beginning I thought the hit detection was off, but then I realised the the recoil has more of an effect than I realised.  Taking your time for that perfect shot is super-satisfying.  Again, zombies lose chunks of flesh, skull, and brains as you shoot them.  You can even blast their legs off.\n\nExplosives-  Deserves a seperate section, despite having only two tools, the grenade and the IED.  Both are VERY powerful, in a good way.  If you aren't careful, you'll end up killing yourself.  Zombies caught in the blast will often lose their legs but survive, so watch for crawlers.\n\nGore-  As mentioned multiple times before now, the gore is exactly what a zombie game should have.  Skulls break, arms are chopped off, legs get blown into nothing.  As of the latest update you can even decapitate zombies.\n\nRating- 8/10, only critisims are that the game needs more maps, and slightly better co-op.  You will not regret buying this game.","September 6, 2014","true","63.8"," 20 of 32 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","20","32","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/indigoviking/recommended/238430/","indigoviking","NotIndigoViking","http://steamcommunity.com/id/indigoviking/","185 products in account","I have thoroughly enjoyed this game so much that I wanted to write a review. Let me start off by saying there are PLENTY of zombie titles on Steam for around the $20 pricetag, except none of them deliver as much as Contagion does. This game is so much fun to play, even if you decide to play escape mode alone, it's still a blast to play.\n\nThis is my go to zombie game every time. The graphics are great, I have no complaints there. They really do a great job in the graphics department. It's just so pretty and smooth. The guns each have there own feel to them, you don't feel like you are using the same gun like in most games. The game modes are some of the best, you can play escape mode which is more objective and obviously you do the objectives to get to the end to escape. The best part is its all randomized so you never play the same objectives and can throw you for a loop just when you think you know what to do. There is Hunted mode which is PvP based and is so much fun, there aren't any Panic servers I don't know why but I haven't gotten to play that game mode. Extraction is very challenging, especially if anyone died and becomes a zombie, you really have a tough time and adds to the suspense.\n\nThe very fact you can be a zombie is huge in this game, they do it right. If you die too many times as a zombie though you will stop respawning and you become a spectator which can really bum you out, Only negative thing about the game is that. I love playing all the game modes however, and there are plenty of people to play with. They really emphasize the headshots in this game, and if you dont you will run out of ammo SO fast and you will die.\n\nI have nothing bad to say about this game, and the developers are still working on this amazing game and are about to release a free DLC to us buyers with 2 new maps 4 new guns and more.\n\nYou will not regret buying this game, it is a blast to play.","December 5, 2014","true","84.6"," 27 of 46 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","27","46","0","0"

But the game lacks content. The game could be a good one and worth the money if it had more maps, more gamemodes, more weapons, more zombie variations and better music for background, weapons, environment and zombies.\n\nThe game also lacks any form of character customization. If you are not going to put that freedom in a survival game then atleast build up a nice storyline around the present characters maybe even with their own pro's and con's.\n\nbeside all this the game can be fun for a little while when played with friends but eventually (around 1- 3 hours) it's get really boring and you know any bush and tree in this game. My message to the creators:\n- make improvements to the sounds in this game\n- try to add 4-8 new zombie models (atleast), more is always better\n- Add new weapons and ways to modify them\n- more maps, play with heights like walkways and tunnels. make a scary shipyard with huge rusted boats. make a map that you are inside a giant mall with several floors with shop you can go into and small rooms in the back ect.\n- more game modes. if you make it fun to have several things to do you will automatically play a game much longer, its that simple. there are ALOT of modes you could think up that would fit this kind of game.\n\noverall score (5 stars max):\n2 out of 5 stars\n\nI hope they will keep working on it and will add in new stuff to make the game better and worth the cost of the game.

There's nothing really special about this game to recommend it to anyone. I got it on sale, and it's given me about 20 hours of moderate fun, so I'd say I'm satisfied. Don't pay any more than $5 for this.\n\nPros:\n- It's fun to shoot zombies\n- The Sig Sauer is really fun\n- The flashlight looks great\n- Boarding up a house and then shooting zombies through doors is really cool\n- Big levels\n\nCons:\n- Zombies are only really affected by headshots. Contagion prides itself on being more realistic, but a .45 ACP to the chest will slow anything down - as it is, anything other than a headshot is wasted ammunition.\n- Guns sound bland, except for the Sig Sauer. I really wish game developers would take field trips to gun ranges to hear what guns actually sound like, rather than just relying on movies.\n- Too much bullet spread. If guns were as inaccurate as they are in this game, nobody would use them. I pointed a rifle at a wall about 20 meters away, didn't move the mouse, and fired five times, waiting enough time in between each shot for the rifle to settle down again. I checked the wall and there were five different bulletholes. At 20 meters, you should be able to put a round in the same place all day long.\n- It isn't cognitively demanding at all. If you try to take it slow and be smart, you'll be disappointed, as every encounter ends up being a non-stop headshot fest.\n\nOverall, I think they could've done better. It feels like it's in Early Access, or something that might have once appeared on XBox Live Arcade.

Nothing super impressive. See a zombie? Kill it. Oh! See another? Kill that one, too. Its the usual run-of-the-mill zombie killing fest we have seen on the uprise the past few years. Graphics are a little dated, being Source and all, although Source is indeed a friendly engine, they should have waited for Source Engine 2 to come out.\n\nAnimations are very stiff, even for a zombie game. Zombie motions seem generic. Although it could be a placeholer for more intricate animations later on, so it is tolerable. Its small details that are easy to overlook. Glitches with holding certain weapons/items are apparent (Wielding a fire extinguisher like a shotgun, for example, or the third person melee swing animations never matching first person animations, which causes hit registration problems in online play, only. Single player is unaffected to my knowledge)\n\nThe sound quality is grainy, unfortunately. The Moans/groans of the zombies can sometimes (about 40 percent of the time) overlap, causing a sound that is akin to flies buzzing in your ear. Most of the time, though, it is drowned out with gunshots and player dialogue. The Player Dialogue, though, is limited at this stage, although there is much room for improvement. Certain situations like finding weapons could in the future have callouts (Like "Hey, shotgun here if anyone needs it!" Or "Pistol ammo, here!" Or something similar, since most of it can be overlooked by mistake by players that are not as aware) Now, one feature that I would love to see would be a voice feature to attract zombies.\n\nPicture, if you will, a scenerio where one player has very low health, most of the team can escape, but this one guy, one good hit and he is gone. He could use the last of his life to go on voice chat and use his actual voice (through the computer microphone) to attract the horde towards him, thus allowing the rest of the team to get to safety (Make an achievement for this, perhaps, too?)\n\nDLC Announcements for this game were announced mid to late 2014, and were pushed back, I am certain there were reasons beyond what has been stated. Maybe so, maybe not, is that our concern? No. Things happen. It is a part of life.\n\nThere are some issues with voice chat, although, from the developer response, it is from the limitations of the Engine itself, not to any fault of theirs. Solution? Use TeamSpeak or another outside client, seeing as this game was more meant to be played with friends, rather than total strangers.\n\nAll things considered, the game DOES have massive potential that has yet to be tapped into! Tatsur0 and group, I apologize about any misunderstandings before, and I wish you the best of luck in the future of Contagion! I will change and add to this review as the game develops. I cannot wait to see what you have in store for us!","May 6, 2015","true","11.3"," 20 of 33 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","20","33","0","2"

It's had alot of work put into it and I find it to be my faviorite game. It may not be the game I give a reword on for being greatly put together, but it sure has become adictive.\n\nTO A PERSPECTIVE(NOT IMPORTANT)\nContagion is one of those games that you'll meet intresting people on. Mostly people from diffrent contrys who don't know what your saying like Gemens and "Vikings" but people all the less. Contagion was released in the time of zombie games, and was one of the most inhabited by diffrent races looking for a good goul game to play.  I started playing when my brother bought me the game when on sale. I found myself trapped in a dark place the first time I played it. Surrounded by people saying things like (UNCIARR) and (TOLLA CARBIAC TUE?) I was realy confused. Then one day I found myself a translator, someone speaking both english, spanish, and german! He guided me through the small frazes that they used and most important tought me how to survive the harsh world full of sludge monsters that ooze blood when you shoot them. I was and still am young at the "video gaming experience" so at every sight of one of the monsters I felt myself fill with cold shivers. But then when I learned the game everything came to a stop, than rewinded and made me what I think is a "pro player" and am now playing this game more than any other. Anyway on to my review.\n\nGAMEPLAY\nContagion fits into a catigory of a "Team Work Game" meaning you usualy in most of Contagions gamemodes need to work together. It has a survival of the team and not a survival of the fitest feel at most times, and is enjoyable with friends. They have fixed most glitches from the first time I played and it feels to run nicely. It has a fair amount of gamemodes with their own original touch to them. New maps would be great, as their are not that many courently in the game.\n\nPROBLEMS/GLITCHES\nThis game seems to have grown from the first time I played it in that it does'nt seem to have many glitches. Yes, ocasionaly you will find a zombie stuck in the stairs or a zombie to be walking on water like it was Jesus, but overal I havent seen many at all in the last few hours I've played.\n\nCOMBATE\nThe combate in this game is dull, it seems to lack what its potentual leads on to seem in that its worse than it seems. Trying to melee a zombie easily is imposible, but it does make up for this with its smart takedowns ability. The weapons are great and fairly acurate to what it would seem like when firing in other first person shooters. At times the zombies melee is a bit to fast for the player and thier speed is a bit to out of hand, but besides that it seems "ok".\n\nABILITY/LIMITS\nThe graphics are quite decent for a game like this, and then running first person view animation is fantastic.\n\nREPLAYABILITY\nIts diffrent gamemodes alow it to be played many times, and since its all different depending on what kind of team you get or what kind of weapons you find, it gives it lots of replayability. No glitches rune it making it very playable, and in the next year I could find myself dropping time like a bomb on this one game.\n\nONLINE\nThe servers can be played on very easily and even with bad internet you can still play it quite well. The other players on it seem to be very kind and acceptable, especialy considering you don't know what they are saying most of the time with thier strange little accents.\n\nREVIEW\nI gave this game 88.9/100 on this game because of its replayability and online formate.","September 9, 2014","true","74.3"," 21 of 35 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","21","35","0","1"

Contagion is easily my favorite. The only other game that comes close is the Nazi Zombies series.\n\nAs an adult gamer, I don’t have much time. I play at least once a week with my friends online. We use a mumble server. Voice chat is absolutely necessary as teamwork is insanely important in this game. You will not be able to run off by yourself and survive. I have a dedicated private server. Which is easy to set up and lets us play without trolls or kids. We prefer the coop “escape” mode.\n\nThe best thing about this game is how brutally hard it can be. Head shots are the only practical way to kill zombies. Ammo is so scarce every single shot counts. It is common to be down to your last two or three shots with zombies on your tail. You can run away, but eventually you will have to stand and fight. Finishing a level is very satisfying and a real accomplishment.\n\nThe levels are enormous, but well laid out. Some game modes do not have a map, so getting lost is possible.  Once you learn them you will not get lost, as most are fairly linear.\n\nThe downside is that there are not many maps. The game needs about twice as many maps as it has now. A few people have released maps via the workshop.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DangerousSaiga/recommended/238430/","DangerousSaiga","Dangerous Saiga","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DangerousSaiga/","221 products in account","Contagion is a first-person, cooperative multiplayer that takes various approaches and scenarios of a zombie apocalypse into a video game. Contagion is a sequel (?) or a spiritual successor (?) to Zombie Panic: Source, which is a free multiplayer mod.  Does the game stands apart from other zombie games? Is it worth playing? What about the replay value? Let's find out.\n\nContagion has a problem on standing out from other zombie games. There is no uniqueness or distinct flavor for this game. Escape Mode is one of the most common gameplay feature where you (and your friends or other players) have to do objectives while trying to get to the extraction point and not being killed on the way there. Escape Mode does have a "moderate" replay value, but most of the time is wasted on backpedaling to an old area to get something or do an objective. This leads to quick boredom and it kills replay value. This mechanic seems familiar to Left 4 Dead's AI Director system in terms on what items are located (along other things), but to go back to a cleared area to do an objective is a bit, odd. In the other hand, Escape Mode can be enjoyable if you have a group of friends to play with (and if your friends really enjoy it). Escape Mode seemed to have died out very quickly and that gameplay feature is the most popular one. Try to play PVP mode? Good luck on that.\n\nThe main problem for Contagion is that the player population is very low and the daily numbers are abysmal based on Steam Charts. Contagion does have sale promotions on the Steam Store to get other gamers to buy the game (as it was shown in Summer, Halloween, Autumn, and Winter Sales), and the results varied. Overall, Contagion is typical, bland, and certainly identical to other zombie games. Contagion was in development for a good amount of years and doing a Kickstarter to help "fully" develop the game is in question that the reader or gamer would have to judge for themselves.\n\nA summary...\n\n1. Is the game worth $20 or regional equivalent? Definitely not.\n2. Are there updates and DLCs for the game? As far as I am concerned, there was a DLC recently released as a update (and it is free). However, the time span between updates are terrible.\n3. Replay value? It varies from "moderate" to downright dreadful.\n4. Sale price of $5 or less (including its regional equivalence)? Your choice. For me, it is not.\n\nI would not recommend it unless you are an avid gamer who likes zombie games. It's a buyer's beware, and take serious accounts from pros and cons for the game from different reviewers.\n\n","July 10, 2015","false","9.2"," 17 of 28 people (61%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","61","17","28","2","1"

Recently I got a week ban on CSGO and was looking for something to kill time until my ban ended. I played this game again for about 7 hours of May 2015 and there were plenty that has changed.\n\nImprovements From Early Access:\n\nLoading Times:\nWhen this game first came out, the load times were absolutely horrendous. Taking 2-3 minutes to even load a map and 30-45 seconds to load the opening menu. Now using the same computer at launch, it takes 10-15 to load the menu and a minute at the most to load the server.\n\nImproved AI:\nThe ai survivors in the extraction mode at launch were basically potatoes. They would follow on command but were unarmed and didn't react to zombies. Now survivors are armed with basics weapons, usually a pistol but I have seen them armed with a shotgun and now react to the zombies.\n\nCons From Early Access:\n\nCommunity:\nOriginally this game and all it's servers were packed from its kick starter hype, finding around a 100 people on 15 servers just on the first tab while I was browsing. Now in May 2015, I can find around 10-20 total in all the occupied servers. What I've seen through steam forums is that monochrome has lost most of its original team, and that promised DLC and kick starter backer bonuses were never delivered. Currently at the moment this community is so small I practically play with tr same guys every night and I practically know everyone's first name and basic information.\n\nRegular Review:\nJust playing as if I had no knowledge of before.\n\nSo loading this game for the first time again in a year I decided to run a game of Hunted, a game mode of up to 16 people surviving in an open arena until there is one. Unfortunately there was only one occupied server with around 10 people playing on the same map (Aurora States). So I spawn in, the map is a dark zombie overrun surburban neighborhood, and I start with a pistol a baseball bat, and some ammo. I hear the moans of zombies and gunshots in the distance, and quickly run to a nearby house and hide in the garage. I think some of the zombies on the street heard me as I hear the front door starting to break, suddenly machine gun fire breaks out and I hear someone enter the house. Suddenly I hear a player enter the house, because it has irregular footsteps and I hear their flashlight flick back and forth. Paralyzed I aim my gun at the door waiting, as the man is going door to door looking for supplies. Then I hear a crash of the window glass breaking and a hail of gun fire and the screams of a man dying. Probably unaware that anyone else was in the house, he opens the garage door where I immediately pump his body with lead. There I stood, looking at the loot of the two men, with an ar15, a revolver, grenade, and around 80 rounds of ammo. This was the most heart pounding zombie experience I've experienced in a zombie game, including DAyZ Standalone and No More Room In Hell\n\nPros:\n\nSound:\nThe guns in this game sound fast, and powerful but not too much where it overdoes it. The rhythmic beat of the small caliber mp5, to the thundering sound of the remington sniper, sound responsive and fluid.\n\nControls:\nControls feel semi-realistic blending the arcade like movement of hl2 and the movement of Insurgency is the best way I can describe it. However you can see your ammo count, see a stamina bar, and see your health which makes it more of an arcade kind of feel.\n\nInfected:\n\nZombies react to noise and sight very well in this game. Run across a street into a home spraying an ar15, and you'll get a horde surrounding you within minutes. Also a very cool element is that everytime a zombie hits you, you have a chance of getting infected, where your screen and sound will blur and turn muffled until you turn. However I wish there was a way to revert it or slow it down like the pills in No More In Hell\n\nCons:\n\nCharacters:\nThere is no story in contagion per say, but all of your selectable characters have a "backstory" which consists of a paragraph description in the selection menu. How am I supposed to even care about these characters when there's no reason to. Also they have no personalities whatsoever and all have the same 18 or so lines in the quick command bar and don't even seem to know each other. Overall worst cast of chaarcters in a video game, don't even know their names to criticize them individually.\n\nWeapon Balance:\nThe weapons in contagion especially the melee weapons are extremely unbalanced. How can a zombie take a full swing from a fireaxe, and live but die from 1 hit on a Kabar Knife. Melee weapons are a joke, and if you find one you should immediately drop it. Okay now you might say, balancing melee weapons is difficult. Well look at No More Room In Hell, a similar game also based on the source engine. In that game, there are heavy swings, which take time to load up and can decapitate zombies, and fast swings which usually don't do anything, both are dependent on the weapon you're using and how much stamina you have left.\n\nMelee weapons aside, the main weapon you'll be using are the guns. However these are horribly unbalanced especially against zombies. I haven't played enough to see of it makes a difference against players in hunted, but here every gun can one tap a zombie with one well placed headshot. Whether it's a high powered sniper, or your 9mm starting handgun, it all feels the same. Also there doesn't seem to be a bullet dropoff damage, as I can get kills with a colt from about 30 meters away with a headshot. Compared to no more room in hell, .22 or 9mm ammo takes 2 headshots to connect, meaning you'll need to use .45 or higher to get a 1 hit headshot.\n\nMusic:\nBland, forgettable, don't even remember how it sounded most of the time. No contrast either? Always stays at the same volume except in a loading screen when it starts to fade out.\n\nLack of Maps:\nMaps are very limited, and the community is fairly dead, so no new maps are coming out to play on via modding workshop\n\nLack Of Map Change or Vote Kick:\nServers seem to be stuck playing the same map over and over with no way to change the map,meaning once you beat a map, you just play it again. So that means everyone is stuck playing one extraction server on Aurora Estates, and escape on Roanake PD. Also we can't vote kick any trolls, and with a severe lack of community, I've never seen a server admin who could help\n\nLevel Progression:\nPlaying a coop map such as Escape on Roanake PD is especially unfriendly for new spawns. Instead of placing a checkpoint t to spawn new players, they spawn right at the beggining, leaving them up to 3-9 objectives behind everyone else which is something that should've been fixed a long time ago\n\nOverall:\nPretty average zombie FPS with some cool ideas but poor execution, and the community has suffered from it in terms of number, and overall support for this game.\n\nScore 6/10\nWould reccomend buying if $5 or less and to buy in a bundle to play with friends\n\nWould recommend playing No More Room In Hell\n-Better Weapon Balance\n-Active Community\n-Active Modders With Maps (ex. played on the walking dead prison)\n\n\n\n","May 24, 2015","true","13.3"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

It throw out of the window the arcade, repetitive and boring gameplay that standardized L4D; focusing on speed runs from point "A" to "B" slicing and gunning through hordes of zombies and "specials", just to arrive to a "safe house" full of weapons and ammo, and repeat the same thing two or three more times in order to finish a map.\nContagion focus it self on cooperative gameplay, management of resources (weapons and ammo), map exploration in order to find those resources and find a one of the three randomly generated scape routes. The gameplay is a "relistic" survival zombie game, were only head shots kills zombies, attacks from them cause infection and ammo is littely found.\nThe problem is, the game has bugs since it early access like zombie pathfinding, charcters skeletons, animations..., there is no lobby and kick system, to play multiplayer with your friends only you must have your own server, there is only a few maps to play and to make it worst there is no modding community fix that. There characters are lifeless and boring, they only swear bad words and that's it. L4D is FAR MUCH BETTER in that aspect and also in the maps.\nContagion has good mechanics, but L4D has better characters, better maps and better modding support. A great zombie game would be the mix of these two games OR a remastered first person edition of Resident Evil Outbreak.","March 29","false","123.6"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

It's got great elements to it, but there are very few servers up with anybody playing, and this is because of the extreme difficulty in knowing what to do in most of the gamemodes.  The maps are confusing and difficult to get around, the game only offers vague objectives with no instructions on where to go, how to get there, or what to do in certain situations.  Leading to players giving up after 30 minutes of wandering around lost with no idea how to get to the next goal.

Rather than a linear map, or run and gun game play, Contagion features an open map level design, and conserving resources such as ammo is key to your success. The game can get hectic with 8 player multiplayer and will involve some discovery by the player to progress through the game. It still has a few rough edges here and there, but overall it's a pretty enjoyable experience.\n\nPros:\n- Open world environments\n- Co-op or PvP game modes\n- Interesting player to zombie game mechanics\n- procedurally generated objectives and item placement\n\nCons:\n- Open world can leave players lost at times\n- A few bugs and quirks that still need ironing out\n- Zombie game play lack luster after a couple of tries","April 19, 2014","true","11.3"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

Typical. First-person shooter, focused on surviving rather than l4d-styled zed slaughter, thought amount of zeds you need to kill is pretty high. What does this game offer:\n- mostly possible to kill zeds with only headshots or explosives (body shots will deal quite little damage, melee mostly effective on head too);\n- @40 minutes long maps (varies depending on knowing map, amount of players etc, good team can run escape in @20);\n- multiple game modes:    Escape: follow 1 of 2 possible routes in zed-infested areas to escape;\nExtraction: find survivors and extract them;\nHunted: pvp, where you kill other players (and then they spawn as PZ and try to kill others too);\nPanic: objectives (player zeds and survivors only, like escape) and classic (1 turning into armored zed and taking down others survivors, till noone left or zed life/time out). Shame, but almost noone plays it now - thought it's kinda quite funny mode;\nFlatline - currently in beta. This mode is somewhat between NMRiH survival maps and Killing floor: zombies come in waves and you need to fight them off. From NMRiH there are traps in map, from KF - shop between rounds (shop is take what you can, no money required and items are rather unlimited, but seems anything dropped in shop area being wiped out).- 4 difficulty levels, which influence amount of zeds, their attack power, friendly fire, amount of guns and ammo spawned on map (however, PZ lmb attack seems to deal constant damage for any difficulty - only bite [rmb from behind] might be affected in terms of damage, since infection chance does increase);\n- Equipment: few guns to shoot (3 rifles, 3 auto rifles, 2 explosives, 2 SMGs, 3 shotguns, 3 pistols for 2 types of ammo summary, bow and crossbow) - some even with flashlight attachment, and melee weapons to swing (ineffective unless fully charged head hit or special takedown from behind). Also, sometimes other equipment(gasmask and pocket flashlight you cannot put in pocket xd, wielder for making barricades at doors and windows, keys and keycards, fire extinguishers and boltcutters);\n- few mods from workshop (mostly - damned useless anime background for phone);\n- upon death/infection - turning into player zombie and hunting survivors down (or being killed by them and then being roach-spectator after few tries);\n- decent graphics;\n- only english as supported language;\n- zombies: casual, a bit faster, armored (no headshot and backstab instant kill) and player zombie. Sometimes, when ppl cannot use shotgun properly(or going for achievement), crawling zombies.\n- cards and achievements (atm no achievements for finishing new maps yet);\n- dedicated official servers for each map and mode, as well as some private servers;\n- after a while, it's a bit bothersome to play all over the same maps - but it's issue for all games;\n- not big number of players online - many note this issue, thought i rarely cannot find ppl to play with.\n\nPersonal opinion - game is somewhat between L4D and No More Room in Hell: alot of guns and ammo for them, alot zombies you need to kill, but mostly only headshots can bring them down and melee isnt 1hit. What i find disappointing - ability to carry 3 assault rifles (98 bullets in) + 150 bullets for them + smg (30 bullets in) + 150 bullets for smg when u`re average Joe without much of pockets and backpack (NMRIH is free zed game and has nice solution for this 1 issue, but has oldest graphics, which is focused on mostly avoiding, not killing everything). Still, for teamwork and shooting zeds game is sufficient enough.\nHowever, do note, that you need to train ur skills to land headshots and playing with random people is sometimes.....annoying. If you have some friends you want to play this game with - then it's good, since having team w teamwork can save the day.\n\nspecial note: promised by devs, ALL dlcs and updates are free. So far i have this game - true. Recently they've added few maps and guns and going to add flatline mode.\nAs for soundtrack - well, typical, but when they published it - on-date owners got it for free. Also, it's much cheaper than in other games.","November 11, 2015","true","165.7"," 22 of 38 people (58%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","58","22","38","2","2"

However, as a game that is labeled "finished," this game is seriously lacking. Not much about it has changed.

It's actually got the concept down more solid than Day Z has.\nBecause this game is an Indie game, I can totally forgive the fact that this game is not perfect. But, as more people invest into this project, I'm sure it will be up to standards with other popular titles such as Left 4 Dead or Dead Island.\nAnother thing about the game is that it is a bit challenging in the sense that you  MUST  conserve ammo. The zombies in this game are attracted to light and sound and in some instances, you must choose between fight or flight, which I personally think is pretty awesome; it's been a while since any zombie game makes my fingers twitch with anxiety. In other words, this game is really not for people that crack under pressure. Even on Normal difficulty, you can die very very easily if you are not paying attention.\nBecoming infected is a very nice feature in this game. I don't think too many zombie games have that option where your player dies and comes back as a zombie. Getting attacked by an infected gives you a chance to become infected as well. (Although, I'm not exactly sure of the infection rates. From what I notice, some of the zombies are more bloody than others.  I'm assuming the bloodier zombies are the ones that infect you- should you come in contact. )\nTo be successful in this game, communication is absolutely necessary. As there are no maps for some modes, you must rely on your teammates' directions or your phone's objectives (which unfortunately is sometimes vague.) Mics are strongly encouraged, especially in Escape modes. Campaigns are randomized so each playthrough is different. Granted, you begin to remember the maps once you start playing a lot, but even the items switch around too which can make finding keys or bolt cutters (what ever your mission requires) very challenging, especially if you are the last man standing with your infected teammates commanding hordes  against you.\nThis game is lacking in some aspects, as mentioned before and should not have been released from beta. Despite this fact, it is still a very fun game to play with friends and the atmosphere makes that setback forgivable (Plus, $20.00 is really not that hefty a price.) Even though I admit this game is far from finished, I believe it is still worth playing. The more people support this game, I'm sure the devs will gradually add more content.\nBut for now, I'd like to pretend this game is still a beta. :)  Don't buy this game if you are not a patient person.","June 19, 2014","true","19.5"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","11","17","0","2"

This game still suffers from a few problems even though there are some fun bits in this game.\n\nI mostly played the Hunted mode because i enjoyed it the most. Hunted mode is where you go around and try and kill other survivors. If you die then you become a running zombie and try and hunt other survivors. But as soon as it comes down to the last few survivors, it becomes a game of hide and seek. which on a very large map can get very annoying.\n\nI found some glitch spots where you can not get hit from zombies and stay hidden throughout the match. Even some hidden spots where the zombies night vision cant see you.\n\nI find that people who start with a SIG than the 1911 have the advantage becuase of the longer clip size and that finding ammo for the SIG is easier than the 1911...or maybe i just suck with the 1911\n\nThere isn't many maps on this game. Even though the items and map changes a bit each round. I find that it isn't enough for a game that costs around £15.\n\nits an okay game but It just needs some fixes and more content.

We tried it again a few days later but couldn't stand more than 10 minutes of it.  When over 12 people all quit a new game that quickly, a consensus has definitely been reached.  We never made that mistake again.  The lack of details in the graphics and the overall gameplay makes it feel like a graduate student's final project.  The screenshots on the store page are very flattering.

We regarded it as the best zombie co op game ever apart from the occasional crash and all was well. Go to play it again after the last few updates. OH MY GOD. What the hell have you done to this game? It now crashes constantly to the point where it's unplayable, the characters now swing their guns all the way from side to side when you look around, which really puts you off - not to mention. THE AIMING. It takes a full second just to point your gun, so basically by the time you're aiming at something other than the floor/ wall and pulling the trigger, the zombies are already gangbanging your face. If you switch weapon while shooting and then switch back to that weapon the game crashes. The zombie ai is now so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that half the time they either don't notice you whatsoever or run in the opposite direction. The revolver is now an utterly pointless piece of junk - it aims slower, shoots slower and reloads even slower. The textures are all bugged out (mostly on the high graphics settings) and basically, the game no longer runs smoothly or even really works. I feel sorry for all the people who paid full price for this, but at least we only paid $5 on sale. Even so, I feel ripped off, and thoroughly depressed. At least I got in over 100 hours while it was still a good game, but seriously devs, you suck. You ruined this game, absolutely ruined it. I miss it.

I bought it and convinced my friends to do the same. I'll detail a bit about it below:\n\nThe premise is pretty cool - imagine a L4D where saving bullets matter and your friends become zombies when they die. The lack of ammo becomes a bit tedious at times; but it didn't really bother me too much. We found it to be annoying that your zombie friends keep respawning over and over, though.\n\nThere are not very many people online - its not fun trying to find a game.\n\nReplayability is basically zero - this game gets repetetive FAST. I'm talking everyone-got-bored-before-we-even-finished-the-first-game fast.\n\neverything is a bit clunky - guns dont feel right when you are shooting them and core mechanics feel cheap. Graphics are not very good, AI is no good, zombie mechanics are a bit dull, and the game is just overall below average in pretty much every day.\n\ngood idea; bad execution. I would not recommend this game to anybody. Sorry boutit\n\n","June 4, 2015","false","6.8"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","7","10","0","0"

Playing solo can be fun but thats about it. The multiplayer is stupid, its fun until people start getting turned to zombies. Then they stop you from going anywhere and the fun is sucked out. Its like a play on left 4 dead that didn't work. Infection is about the dumbest thing in the game. You get hit once and you have a chance to be infected, with no way to cure it. The Server system in the game is also pretty broken. You try to connect to a server and it could give you a variety of errors. Not to mention there is no way to tell what difficulty you are joining on unless you specified for a certain one. Maybe in the future this could be a good, enjoyable game with friends or alone.

The few lines of 'background story' to each character is everything you get.\n\nIn the trailers, they NEVER mentioned that we are gonna get small confined maps full of zombies that can spawn just from anywhere, and only a handful of 'survivors'.\n\nIn a co-op mode, there is no storyline. Just random situations in the same ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ maps.\njust a 'go here, find this, go there'-like objectives. Firearms are limited and zombies come at you in endless numbers. It's the same ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t every round.\nThey say 'Every round is unpredictable' ; well that's not true.\nYou run around, fight zombies by unrewarding and boring fighting mechanisms, and you get to the end 'somehow'.\n\nPerhaps they wanted to make a zombie sandbox game. I thought that's what this could be. I was wrong.\nAs mentioned, the maps are small. Each map is EXACTLY the same every round.\n\nIn a deathmatch game, those with best camping skills are rewarded.\nIf you walk around fighting zombies, guys will come after you and kill you. One blow from a zombie is enough to make you into a zombie. Better you camp with your back to the wall, and wait for the brave freeroamer to come in and get killed by you.\n\nI can see what they wanted to make. In their imaginations, this was the best realistic zombie simulator.\nBut it's mediocre, really. I'm a zombies game fan, and I know that 'Left 4 Dead' is an unrealistic, arcady and funny game with running zombies. But it had at least enough variation - even without that 'completely unpredictable' ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t - to keep me entertained for many many hours.\n\nI can see they tried. But Should that be enough? I don't think so. I won't say don't buy it, but don't believe what they promise. Keep down your expectations. You won't need them.\nBut all the features that could have been good, are only half done.

Romero” Zombie apocalypse…or max brooks zombie survival guide setting…or the walking dead…you get the picture. Slow, hard to kill…zombies. My review will touch on aspects I feel focus on the strengths and weaknesses of the game. There are plenty of both trust me.\n\nGRAPHICS AND ATMOSPHERE\n-the good-\nThe visuals serve well on initial playthroughs. I honestly felt helpless and weary what could be around the next corner. The stark contrast in environmental lighting made good use of my flashlight. All of it  makes a trigger finger really twitchy. Weather changes with rain in some maps adds nice ambience too.\n\n-the bad-\nMy only complaint that the exterior parts of some maps lack of variety, changes in lighting in procedural sort of way could remedy this. Much like the ever changing maps on each walkthrough can stir up silent dread awhile longer. After my first 10 hours or so even on solo play-throughs, the fear diminishes pretty quickly.\n\nPVP GAMEPLAY\n-the good-\nBy far the strongest aspect of the game, players will be served PVP modes on ALL game types. Died as a survivor during escape or extraction mission? No worries, you’ll always have a guaranteed turn as the member of the undead. Cut loose and wreak havoc and fear on your friends and enemies.\n\nThe game mode Hunted, is specifically catered to this. You can start a game with a group of survivors or a player controlled zombie. Gunning, mauling, and devouring each other till the last man standing wins. Of course, even if you’re killed it’s only the beginning.  Zombie gamplay is present in this mode as well.\n\nEven though I fall in the lets say…..%10 of the gamer population that does not enjoy pvp, I’ve actually had fun…given that the company wasn’t too obnoxious or a bunch of hate mongering trolls. Mind you this pleasant experience only occurred once in my 24 hours of total game play. But hey…if you enjoy trash talkin and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ some one off over the mic or text.…this game definitely for you.\n\n-the bad-\nNow for the downsides…. If you’re not big on player versus player….you’ll hate this game. A gratifying experience is slim. The best way to try to enjoy this of this is to wrangle up a group of friends and some how make a private server.  Even that’s not STRAIGHT FORWARD OR FREE, AS IT SHOULD BE.\n\n\nCO-OP GAMEPLAY\n\n-the good-\nWhen surviving with friends (and at very rare times random players) that have a good sense of teamwork, CO-OP in contagion is tense, gory, and suspenseful  fun!  It requires a lot more thought and planning. Running in with guns blazing has its place but doing it all the time will doom yourself and your fellow survivors….which in most circumstances you DO NOT want…trust me. I admire this pacing cause it’s more of a thinking man’s game.\nWhen player synergy is possible reaching extraction points and claiming victory is quite gratifying in a “high five” sort of way.\n\n-The bad-\n9 times out of 10, your co-op mission will fail when joining public games.  Too many things can go wrong such as….\n-Having to deal with being lost for long periods of time if joining mid game\n-Players that join mid-game as zombies can quickly spoil your chances of survival\n- Uncoordinated player survivors will slow progress to a crawl.\n-Confusing or vague clues for reaching the next objective\n\nThe pvp aspect has too much of a presence in co-op gameplay, even if you create or join a server that disables the “infection” or “player zombie” feature. Once you’re dead…you’re out. There should be a optional “left 4 dead” feature that appeals to PVE players, such as being incapacitated into a “bleedout” status.\n\nOther players could be allowed a window of chance to aid comrades to their feet when health is depleted, at least for a limited amount of times before death. This would give a nice set of balanced options for PVE and PVP, more appealing across the board. At the moment this game unfairly leans to the latter.\n\n\nSOLO GAMEPLAY\n\n-the good-\nIf you wish to truly experience terror and what it means to be prey, initial walkthroughs of extraction and ESPECIALLY escape mode on your own will certainly deliver…. Most likely only skilled players will be able to accomplish this, and victory is so very sweet when you’re able to run screaming toward your escape. I’ve only been able to pull it off twice in each game mode, but man it was thrilling.\n\n-The bad-\nReplay value on your own is basically zero… Even with procedural map generation, throwing yourself at the similar set of objectives the second time around is quite boring and a tedious chore. If a chain is only as strong as its weakest link, this is it… contagion highly depends on group game play to be anywhere near fun or even approachable the second….third….time around. Most likely there’d be never be a forth….\n\nIf you really want this game to have staying power in your library, bring friends....and some how your own server.... >:(\n\nMULTIPLAYER OPTIONS\n\n-The good-\nContagion is well suited for those looking for PVP for public lobbies. Pick a game mode, join a pub server and you’ll shooting or munching on other players in no time. Nuff said.\n\n-The bad-\nOkay so….\n-No “friend only” lobby option\n-No direct private server options\n-Servers for RENT are available on contagion….\n-Free private servers can only be created via 3rd party programs\n\nWith aspect like these, contagion still feels like a mod and not a developer’s fully released game. Lacking intuitive or direct access to people not accustomed to modding or pc gaming.\n\n-FINAL THOUGTS-\nIf you’re looking for a great combination of zombie survival and PVP gameplay, definitely grab a copy.\n\nFor players that have a strong affinity for co-op fun and thrills..... should think twice though….if you have a dependable group of friends and a means for creating your own servers, then it’s worth a buy.\n\nIf not….stick to l4d2.","July 6, 2014","true","51.9"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","10","16","0","0"

Zombies are actually the annoying ones because they're just everywhere, plus with just one gunshot you attract almost every zombie in the area. If there was a mod that would remove them(zombies)the game would be amazing so then the plaers wouldn't have to worry about zombies killing them.\n\n#1(Advantage:Zombies in Hunted Mode)When you get killed as a Survivor you turn into a zombie, the undead can climb walls, roar to basically call other zombies, and attack survivors from behind which if completed to do that the survivor that has been biten will then turn into a zombie in a short but long amount of time. Anyways if there were any players(survivors) camping somewhere, the zombies could attack them killing the survivors so then no one else would have to wait a long time to become a survivor(Every round everybody becomes a survivor just a fyi). But still ZOMBIES ARE JERKS!\n\n#2(Disadvantage:LAG)Frag not Lag is a fricken lie for this game so don't believe it -.-. You absolutly have to change the texture settings to medium. If you don't have to do that and can be kept on high with barely any lag, then you my unknown friend is lucky!\n\n#2(Advantage:LAG)I HAVE NO IDEA! Or probably you can get past crap easily with less things being able to hit you.\n\n#3(Disadvantage:Ring Ring PICK UP THE LOUD RINGTONE!) Okay, in the settings it gives you a choice to what type of ringtone you want. SADLY, all the ringtones are loud and can attract survivors that want to kill you, or zombies that want to eat your flesh. Vibrate is the best one cause it's quieter and doesn't have a long "tone".\n\n#3(Advantage:Ring Ring, Troll Ring)Ifyou want to troll keep using the loud ringtones, it'll attract players to come to you and zombies. If you know that you wont be able to take down a player cause they're camping somewhere, do a few gunshots and use the ringtone. The stupid thing about that is that the zombies will be coming for both of ya'll. The ringtones can also tell you where other players are by listening for the tone. But warning they cann also call you!\n\nIF THERE ARE ANY QUESTIONS OR OPINIONS JUST TELL ME :3, sorry if you didn't like the review or thought I didn't type enough but hey I just felt like reviewing something.\n\n","June 20, 2014","true","55.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The problem comes from other players, who will frequently run ahead to either get themselves killed to grief on the survivors (as it's too easy playing as a zombie - more on that in a bit), or just to finish the map before anyone else, often leaving new players lost and confused.\n\nAdditionally, it's far too easy to play as a zombie.  Zombies have four times the survivor's sprint, and can duck faster than bullets fly in order to avoid headshots.  Speaking of which, headshots are the only way to kill a zombie, which is fine, but not so much when a shotgun at point blank doesn't even make them stumble.\n\nZombie players will often simply hide around corners, waiting for a player to walk by for a single swipe - hoping to get the RNG on their side for the infection chance.\n\nAll in all, the game has the potential, but until zombie mechanics are changed to balance players versus zombie players, don't get this game unless it's on sale, of unless you have a group of friends and a closed server (or enough friends to fill a server by yourselves).","March 23","false","130.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dawning77/recommended/238430/","dawning77","Dawning33","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dawning77/","60 products in account","I have found this game incredibly fun and fulfilling, even with the more limited content available. The slightly slower pacing compared to a run-n-gun zombie shoot-em-up is refreshing as you have to actually scavenge for your ammo and supplies and, especially on harder modes, conserve as much as you can.\nIf you like cooperative play like I do, the escape and extraction modes are fun, especially if you find a good group of people. In escape, you have to navigate a level with some objectives and obstacles that rotate through a couple different scenarios, and in extraction you locate NPC survivors, hold out for a time against hordes, and then escort them to a drop off point. As with any online game, you will probably get in several games with people that aren't as cooperative or skilled, but when you have a good team it's very fun.\nIf you favor competitive play, there's always hunted and panic modes. Hunted is your basic pvp, where players killed become zombies and when there's two left, all NPC zombies charge at the two remaining players. In Panic, one player begins the game infected but may not know it for a few minutes, and the only zombies in the level are the player zombies, while the first player zombie respawns as a SWAT zombie. Human players have to kill the zombies a certain number of times, or survive for like 20-30 minutes to win.\nAll in all, I got the game on sale for $5, and I would say it's the best 5 I've spent in a long time. Yes, some graphics aren't as up-to-date and some animations can be wonky, but it's not distracting to me at all. I would recommend this game even at the 20 price if you think this sort of thing appeals to you.","September 11, 2014","true","212.9"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Fences that act as wall barriers to make you go through long alternate routes is fine until you see not only zombies, but other suvivor NPCs climb over them with ease.\n\n- Very bad guns balancing. It's ok if I have to do head shots to kill zombies, but it's a bit ridiculous if I have to do a headshot with a shotgun in pin point distance to kill them too. SMGs, ARs advantages are really only just a higher fire rate for me to spam more bullets to hit heads rather than doing more damage or more stopping power.\n\n- Bad resource management and feedback. You will have to guess how much of a type of ammo you have if you don't have the corresponding guns that use the specific ammo. Dropping ammo for team mates that require them is pretty much gonna be a disaster of mess, which it really shouldn't be for a game that is suppose to rely on good team work.\n\n- Each co-op playthroughs has no or very little and quite meaningless variant in paths and objectives, despite what's being advertised to you. Randomization of weaponary really doesn't mean much when the balancing of them are so bad that your pistol will normally do the job.\n\n\nThe bottom line:\n\n- The game is fun with friends for the first few times until you have ran through each map once or twice.\n\n- If you are looking for an experience similar to L4D campaign co-op, there is a grand total of 2 maps of that that will take at max 2 hours to complete, with a high chance that you have missed a key somewhere and spending 20 minutes being frustrated looking for it.\n\n- If you don't have friends to play this with, your best bet is the pvp hunted mode as it's the only mode that still has a few players playing in and it's the mode that require the least team work if at all. In which I really have to say that there are just about hundreds and thousands of other shooters that plays and look better, do yourself a favor and play those instead.\n\n- There is not much content, or variations as of this review is written. Surely you can always keep an eye on steam workshop for actual extra content, but keep your expectations in check until the free DLC hits.","July 11, 2014","false","7.5"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","0"

I don't understand how it's gotten positive reviews up until now. The concept is great and the trailers make the game seem that way too. However, once you're in the game, it's just a painful road of confusing modes, horribly done controls, and extremely laggy servers (unless you pay to have one hosted, which I refuse because the game isn't that good anyway).\n\nThe worst part about this is the lack of tutorial. You are tossed into the middle of extremely annoying zombies and are praying you remember the controls. Dying is a huge punishment since it spawns you as far away from anything as you can. Memorizing the maps is extremely difficult and if you're not spending hours upon hours of figuring that out, you're screwed.\n\nI do NOT reccommend this game. I had hope it was go ing to be good, but unless you can pay for a good server and have an highly updated computer, you're not going to have fun. They spent way too much time on the graphics of the game and very little on the actual game play. Horribly disappointing, avoid it at all cost.","June 4","false","3.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

I use a amd processor in case your wondering.\n\nGAMEPLAY\n\nits essentially like left for dead with two differences, you can have a team of eight players and zombies are stronger and less numurous.\n\nZOMBIES\n\nthere are normal zombies that can be taken down with headshots and then there is only a one special zombie which is one with a suit of riot gear.\n\nGRAPHICS\n\nI think they look nice for a indie game, textures are great and lighting makes the game look more real\n\nDIFFICULTY\n\nit is actually difficult to complete a map in a game starting off, most games have a infected setting turned on so a single scratch can result in a player turning into a zombie and become a enemy to the other players.\n\nCOMMUNITY\n\nmajority of players I have encountered in this co-op game are pretty cool and co-operative however you get some rotten apples every now and then. this includes people who hog weapons and ammo and team killers in freindly fire servers who  decide to blow up a pack of C4 in the middle of a group of freindly players.\n\nMAPS\n\nthe maps change of objectives each time you play them, there are about 5 good maps in this game for the escape (campaine mode). I had fun completing all of these maps.\n\nMODS\n\nloads of neat customisation mods available\n\n","June 13, 2015","true","26.5"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

You have many game modes, you have many weapons to grab, tools to use, there is a variety of zombies, it's graphically superior to many other games, and it's a challenge to anybody who wants to play a zombie game and doesn't want to be bothered by a-holes ruining the games, like they do in other zombie games I could mention (but I won't, you already know of which I'm talking about).\n\nYou shoot the zombies to the brain and the brain explodes, you see the bullet coming out of their head exactly where it should, and it's awesome. You need to take care and not waste your ammo because there's few and it's a valuable and scarce resource; same goes with medkits.\n\nThere are currently three game modes, one in which you must escape a facility carrying on a number of tasks, another where you need to evacuate a neighbourhood before it gets overwhelmed (and you must hold position barricading and such) and a game called "hunt" made for PVP combat. The first two are cooperative, although there is friendly fire so look where you shoot. The last one is a free for all deathmatch; the last man standing wins.\n\nAlthough there are few maps at the time, you can see they are very detailed and won't get bored so easily as there is also a script which randomizes each game making it feel fresh, changing everything from weapon spawns to open hallways and houses.\n\nAll in all and even though it's early access this game is a gem and if you're into zombie shooters you should give it a test drive because it may be just what you were looking for.","February 19, 2014","true","44.9"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","1"

And while that might be true, Contagion is also a lot more.\n\nThe game is still in "Early Access Beta", and so far it is shaping up to be quite promising.  My favorite mode is "Escape".  You need to work with your team mates, watch each other's backs, and... escape.  The slow pacing adds to the sense of dread and paranoia that will hit you while you scavange for a few more bullets and try to find the way out.  The smart phone your character carries provides objective updates and on some modes a map and GPS directions.\n\nReaching the end and escaping is highly satisfying after the methodical gameplay and teamwork you need to use to get there.  Once more maps are added it will only improve this great game even more.\n\nThis game is well worth the price of entry and a steal if you can get it on sale.","December 15, 2013","true","12.7"," 12 of 21 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","12","21","0","0"

The graphics are great, the weapon selection is good and the survival gameplay is major in this game.  This also has to be one of the most realistic zombie shooters too.  You have to search for weapons, ammo and supplies.  Sometimes you'll have to look for bolt cutters to cut a chain off a fence or a keycard to open a locked door.  Just like in real life you have to conserve your ammo and learn to share with fellow players.  If you grab all of the ammo they won't have any.  The game makes it easy to share unneeded ammo with fellow players.  To survive you have to work together.  The maps are large and it's easy to loose teammates if you don't stick together.  Unlike Left4Dead you don't have indicatators to help find other players.  I highly recommend using a mic so you can talk to other players.  When under attack you won't have time to type.  This game can be played single player or multiplayer.  But if you play single player don't expect casual gameplay.  Even on easy, this game isn't that easy.  Don't let any of this keep you from getting this game.  If you want a zombie shooter that has great survial gameplay and is well made, this is it!  (Hint: make your headshots count.)\n\nPros\nA very well made zombie shooter!\nGraphics\nRealistic\nGood sized maps\nEncourages teamwork\nSome paths in the level randomize with each playthrough.

Sometimes they release a seasonal update to reflect Halloween or Christmas.\n\nCons\nHosting multiplayer - you have to do it the "hard way".

If you like the concept of dayZ pvp and loot but don't want to suffer through a "simulator" that requires large amounts of time investment and forces you to eat/drink and walk extreme distances then Contagion is worth a try.\n\nThis game also has a coop mode that is basically Left for dead but with more players. Players must get from one objective to another and find gear along the way. One cool thing about contagion is that when you die you spawn as a zombie until the next round. This means that if you are infected or die early on you don't have to be taken out of the action.\n\nThe PVP mode is basically a free for all. Everyone spawns around a pretty large map with a pistol and compete for gear. You can choose a building and board it up to create a little hideout.\nIts pretty intese when dozens of zombies are trying to bust into your little fortress.\nWhen you die you respawn as a zombie for a chance to get revenge on whoever killed you.\nAs a zombie you can gather hoards of NPC undead and direct them toward the survivors.\n\nThis game features a nice variety of gear. Everything from Crossbows to machine guns and plenty of melee weapons. Also the devs continue to add gear and maps for free.\n\nOnly a few nitpicks with this one: Some maps can be difficult to navigate in coop. You can sometimes get lost especially if you aren't sure what to do next. Also some servers have zombie players disabled. This means that if you die you will respawn as a cockroach until the round ends.\nI suggest avoiding those servers unless you really hate those pesky player zombies.\nAlso the population of the game can sometimes die between steam sales and content updates.... Only a few servers to choose from in those scenarios.\n\nOverall this game is really cool because you get the intese PVP that dayZ is known for but without the open-world grindyness or low framerates that dayZ subjects its players to. Contagion runs on the source engine so the framerates are high on a variety of system configs. The graphics aren't anything special but the game still looks great. I give it a thumbs up.","November 4, 2015","true","15.4"," 14 of 25 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","14","25","0","0"

This game gives you that chance. Theres no special infected fluff, or crazy unloading buckets of ammo into zombies. You have limited ammo with what you find, you are being hunted by human survivors, as well as zombies. They give you a false sense of security that they shamble, but after a few shots fired, they swarm just like out of a movie.\n\nThis game gives you that creepy atmosphere that no place is safe, and there is no safe room, its you against them, and staying still means death. Stay on the run, find friends, and for God's sake only fire when absolutely required.

There is at present a limited number of options for maps at the moment (a situation I expect to change in the near future), but from what I can tell the map quantity does not need to be high. It offers a dynamic gameplay so that each playthrough is unique. The maps lock certain ways and unlike others each time, which is unique unto itself. The fact that players who die come back as zombies makes the game that much more fun. It is somewhat limited in scope, however. The physics are not as polished as some other zombie games, and there are only two kinds of zombie to face - regular and armored. The player zombies act as 'leaders' for the horde only in that they can command them; they do not have enhanced hp or special abilities. However, the games modes included do make up for the seeming lack of variety or polish. Hunted is effectively a deathmatch with zombies thrown in for flavor, escape is the classic left for dead style run through, escort is the typical escort-style mission with zombies, and panic is a simple pc v pc human v zombie deathmatch mode. Another plus is the survival-style limited resources provided. Every game mode, no matter the type, forces the player to constantly scavenge for ammunition and equipment, which is how one would imagine a zombie apocalypse to play out. Over all this is a decent game, though if you dislike the survival horror genre stay away. Ammo conservation is paramount to survival here.","June 22, 2014","true","4.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It is not going to be all-out dissing the game, but there are ups and downs about this game. I know it is in beta but the game seems to be centering around tasks. It might just be me noticing this but the animations are a bit choppy, zombies will randomly dissapear, and the zombie's animations are a bit odd remarking their savage behavior. What I mean is that this game needs more time, I think the game shouldn't have been released at this time, giving it's condition. Yes, the game is almost stable, but I think that if they put more effort into the zombie's animations that will fill up that space. Moving on to the players, the melee weapons are hard to get used to, due to lack of damage, making them complayely useless. This game is relying too much on the guns side. Unlike NMRiH (No More Room in Hell), the melee is actually usefull, the Contagion team needs to add Critical Hits, and the ability to sever limbs. The players animations confuse me between weak hits and powerfull hits with melee weapons. I think that they need to show the player charging up their hit, and then releasing it upon the enemy. If the Contagion crew wants some inspiration, I recommend these games to light a spark: L4D 1&2, NMRiH, Project Zomnoid, The Dead Linger, and  7 Days to Die. I know this review was long and I hope the Contagion crew reads this and might get inspired or get notified of these glitches or problems, I will update if I come across anyhing.","December 27, 2013","true","20.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Just by saying this you realize this is a game with a community older than 10 years. The fact that when you die as a normal player you become the enemy, a zombie without any of the l4d shenanigans, it's its strongest mark.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CCLsama/recommended/238430/","CCLsama","CCL sama","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CCLsama/","79 products in account","Contagion is a zombie game with a good portion of realism. It uses the source engine and allow us players to create custom maps which I love it so much.\n\nGamemodesThere are many game modes out there but no tutorial so you are better off by watching the trailer first to get to know about the gamemodes before you get confused will all the new features. For example if you had enough with coop, you can play against other players in a level filled with the walking dead.\n\nMain featuresThe main core in this game is that the zombies are slow and they won't die so easily if you don't shoot his brain! This is very important because headshot differs from brainshot here so aim it carefully on the forehead where the brain is located! There is also the infection rate which can be very high depending on the difficulty.\n\nOne of the unique feature is to turn into a zombie which will happen when you are infected or when you died. Your new goal now is to kill all the remaining survivors. Playerzombie are faster than normal zombies and can roar which makes the zombies follows you. You can command zombies to different places and the blending ability is a skill that will turn you into a regular ai zombie as camouflage until you stop the blend mode.\n\nFurthermore the ammo and weapon spawns are all randomly located, the same thing happens on some objectives in escape mode too which boost up the replayability greatly.\n\nThe gore system in Contagion is pretty well made. If you have a sharp melee weapon you can cut off almost every bodypart from the zombie. If you cut off a leg they will turn into crawlers. Cutting both arms will disable their ability to attack. All the wounds will be displayed even on shooting. You can even do finishing melee moves if you manage to sneak up behind a zombie.\n\nOVER 1000 hours!? WHY THE THUMB DOWN?Because I tried everything to keep this community together and keep having faith on this company for two years, but, alas, without luck. I'm a hobby level designer and created the custom map HotZ and I'm also currently working on another project for Contagion called TWZ.\n\nThe development of HotZ took me almost one year and until now it received regularly updates. Seeing how everything is going downhill due to the bad decisions of Monochrome is incredible frustating and sad for me since I invested a lot of time and effort for this game. I met a lot of nice and helpful people when it was still active but now I just reached the limit. Seeing the people who I know leaving one after another makes me very sad.\n\nUpdatesSadly even with all the gamemodes the content seems to be rather small since the whole core team left Contagion and that speaks a lot about the image of Monochrome. The company promises free DLCs but due to those critical hiccups it got delayed pretty long and there is still a lot to do. The good thing is that Monochrome is still trying to kept their promise but the sad thing is that a lot of bugs are still untouched and mentioned regular updates are nowhere to be seen which leads to an big issue with the Community :(\n\nCommunityThe community is much smaller than before and it keeps decreasing due to the lack of updates and communication with the playerbase. There is also almost no support when it comes to custom content. That's why we don't see any map related content in the workshop which is quite a shame. The mentioned community interaction on the forum is just a promotion on Tatsur0's (CEO) twitch channel that has very little to do with interacting with the community itself where it really counts.\n\nConclusionThere are many zombies games in steam that focused more in action than on the survival aspect and the consequences unlike Contagion. Contagion is a game that has a deep learning curve which makes the game so special...\n\nBUT sadly, the game feels kinda unfinished and filled with a lot of minor bugs. The lack of update with sloppy results and the lost of the core developers certainly crippled the community to death.\n\nWell, if you really wanna buy it then buy it on sale and don't forget to try out my custom map.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=353212111","June 26, 2014","false","136.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Source, It was my favorite steam game, I've played years of it and when I heard about Contagion I got super excited for it.\n\nIn the weekend they put the game for a free weekend and on deal, I played the trial and fell in love with it, After a while I bought the game and I'm not dissapointed, A big thank and congratulations to the developers for making such a great game.\n\nThis game is similar to Zombie Panic! Source so you'll get almost no problems with understanding the game's gameplay.\n\nSo basically there are various gamemodes and maps, Each map with it's own objectives and each mode with it's own point.\n\nFor a start I would suggest trying out ce_losmuertos (Escape : Los Muertos)\n\nFrom what I can tell it's the easiest map out there.\n\nTalking about the game, You at the start are a survivor, And there are other zombies/infected that are out there trying to stop you, There are many actions that you can do when you are a survivor or a zombie, Which is great and balanced.\n\nThe game has some realism, So you'll get tired after sprinting (Yes theres sprinting!) for a while, Jumping and you have no crosshair, So iron sights are a very useful thing here.\n\nFor zombies you can roar, Use your zombie vision, Blend (Activate a CPU to play for you) and command other zombies.\n\nIf you think you'll let zombies hit you and you'll be fine you're wrong, Because theres infection!\n\nI really love these kind of games, So it's a 5 out of 5.","September 1, 2014","true","51.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Though it is in development I already think this game is amazingly fun, and I'm sure I'm going to spend alot of hours on it. Like alot of games, this game takes just a little bit of getting used to. It may seem difficult at first, or the controls may seem weird(I always change mine to what fits my playstyle) but if you give the game a try I'm positive you'll have some crazy adrenaline filled moments that will have your palms sweating. If it is going to be your first time playing, I highly suggest you play a coopertive mode such as Escape or Extraction. If you play a pvp mode on your first time you might get a little frustrated from dying by more experienced players.

However, it is very hilarious if you don't want to play a serious game with your friends and it is a neat idea, but it just needs a lot of improvement.\n\nAs for the actual singleplayer game, meh.

It's the time it takes for the game to be "complete" for me. The game has a few bits of bugs here and there and while that isn't really much of a problem since to me, it's using a very old engine. Using that old engine has its cons like it doesn't take a ultra gaming pc to play the game and it doesn't require much eyesore in terms of the graphics itself cause they revamped it so much. The gunplay in terms of that engine though is quite thrilling. Using your phone tactically was a first for me. Oh and its sooo not like L4D btw just puttin that out there.

The AI needs an overhaul, the Player Zombies are overpowered, and balancing is needed.\n\nBut, if there's one thing that keeps me coming back, it's these developers.\n\nThey actually listen and know what their community wants.\n\nThe game shipped with 8 players max.\n\nSome of us asked for more players, and they raised the cap to 16.\n\nThe game came with one PvP game-type called Hunted, pitting players against each other and a bunch of AI-controlled zombies. Some guys wanted the ability to disable player zombies, some guys wanted to get rid of the AI-zombies.\n\nWhat did the devs do? Both. They released a game-type called Zombie Panic and added toggle options for Player Zombies and Infection.\n\nMost devs keep quiet about their work, these guys don't. They have a list of things that they are working on.\n\nPioneer Express? Barlowe Square? They told all of us about these maps. What are they working on now? CE_Biotec.\n\nGot a question about the game? Post it in the forums. If it's something that the community can't answer, the devs probably will.\n\nSome reviews have said that the devs ban people who criticize their game. They don't, otherwise I would've been gone a long time ago.\n\nNow, onto the actual review.\n\nThis game is hard, and I mean ridiculously hard. That's one of its charms.\n\nIt's a survival horror game that forces you to work in order to master it, a lot like the original Resident Evil games.\n\nAmmo is scarce, navigation is difficult, and zombies are strong.\n\nEventually though, these 3 problems fade away as you begin to conserve ammo, learn the maps, and aim for the heads.\n\nIt's a game that punishes you for stupid mistakes, but every time you do something right, you'll feel like you've accomplished something.\n\nIt's a love-it-or-hate-it type of game, and it's one that I personally enjoy.","June 26, 2014","true","62.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Feels like the zombie apocalypse, with that atmosphere, the ability to board up entrances, infection, and a mode that allows humans to fight each other over resources. Tense, addictive. Challenging, so satisfying, hard won victories. Escape Mode plays like a proper single-player survival horror, but with co-op, and player zombies: look for the way to proceed, find objective items like fire extinguishers and keys, etc. Allows players fighting each other as Humans, zombies. Varied, dynamic modes. Randomized objectives means you can't predict quite where to go, or what to do, even after playing levels many times. Solid co-op, with 2-16 players. Good alternative to Left 4 Dead, which it is a clone of.\n\nCons: Some awkward elements, such as glitches and bugs. Exploits that some players abuse. Players that are zombies are not quite equal to 'human' players, the way it is in, say, Aliens vs Predator. Too little content. Not as refined as Left 4 Dead. No "easy" way to play, and steep learning curve, and rarely winning does get frustrating.\n\nMy recommendation: Get this if you want an alternative to Left 4 Dead that is not streamlined, and even more realistic and dynamic.","September 9, 2014","true","125.3"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

The only problem I have with the Escape levels is that when a player dies, they then become a zombie and in my past experience, it is very easy for that one player to then wipe out the remaining "survivors".

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/imnotaweebtho/recommended/238430/","imnotaweebtho","Hex","http://steamcommunity.com/id/imnotaweebtho/","140 products in account","The main game mode is called escape and sees up to 8 players try to work their way through a map full of zombies to escape a situation. The puzzles are pretty basic and usually involve finding an item to open a door or barrier. Each time you play the game the route changes, keys change location, different doors are unlockable/open, one game saw the team using vents to get around the map instead of taking the stairs. The zombies are easy enough to kill but a lack of ammo and limit to the number of things you can hold means that you often resort to using risky melee weapons. The limits on holding 5 things at once mean that through the game you do things such as swap a key for machine gun with no ammo(in the hope you will find ammo) only to find that the armory later in the game is locked..\n\nDeathmatch sees up to 8 players battling it out on medium sized maps filled with zombies. While not strong the zombies are a great addition to the fight. The match is slow paced and it can be quite hard to find other human players, following a hoard who can smell human blood is a great way to track people down. Other ways to find humans include following flashlights, which works great when you see a small flash in the front room of the house next door or following gunshots. Gunshots is a great idea by the developers because at some point human players find themselves cornered in a loft with a zombie they need to take out; unfortunately, unless you have 5.1 sound its unlikely to help locate people that much.\n\nI should point out the game is beta, so there is plenty of time for things to change. I don’t know how being a zombie can be more fun while not making them too powerful for humans. While it takes a while to hunt a human player down in escape mode, this stops the humans getting overran by 5 zombie players. I should also note that while being a zombie was a tad boring, playing as a human was really fun. It was also really tense, death actually meant something to the player and kept you on your toes.\nI’m giving this 4.5 stars because I’m knowingly taking part in a beta. Perhaps I would give it 3.5 if this was the finished product, but it’s not. Reviewing games at this stage in their life is perhaps a little unfair, but I think its good giving games trying something new and following the kickstarter/green light/beta business models as much coverage as possible.\n\n4.5/5 stars :D\n","March 7, 2014","true","26.9"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AlexSledge/recommended/238430/","AlexSledge","AlexSledge","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AlexSledge/","675 products in account","Escape: If you've played any of the original Zombie Panic: Source modification, you know escape mode. You and a number of friends play as human suvivors (for now) of a zombie outbreak, having just retreated into the lobby of a deserted and overrun metropolitan police facility and you have to work together and make your escape from the building. Along the way you scavenge for ammunition, tools and supplies to help you overcome the challenges of the facility. As your friends fall, they turn into Alpha Zombies, able to sprint, climb, and jump with abilities normally outside the capability of a Zombie (more akin to a 28 Days Later infected, or an Alien in AvP). Able to access some areas inaccessable to the human players, the quest for survival becomes more difficult as time goes, and the number of Alpha Zombies rises and surpasses that of the remaining humans. The escape route is randomized, keeping the map fresh for many play throughs.\n\nHunt Mode: A well done tense stalking simulation, where you and a number of friends begin as humans scattered amidst a zombie infested suburban community, cul-de-sacs and all, or a quarantine research tent complex deployed in a local municipal park. Each round you must outlast the rest of the players to be the last one alive, whether through pacifist evasion, cooperative efforts, or active negation (killing the other humans Hunger Games/Running Man style) - and as the players fall, they become alpha zombies, just as in escape, making the game progressively harder as time goes on.\n\nTwo key factors of both the above modes is that the maps themselves are large (in the virtual square footage sense) and structurally randomized in some sense, doors / pathways open in one round may be blocked, locked or closed off in the next - fires and other phenomenon are randomized somewhat as well - keeping the levels fresh for many play throughs. Additional, resource placement (ammo, weapons, tools), is randomized throughout the level as well - the shotgun you found on the receptionists floor may not be there the next time.\n\nContagion uses the Source engine as well, so the movement and feel of the game is on par with other Source games I've played, keep that in mind if you're finicky about those things.\n\nMy Wishes:\n\n1) While there certainly would be work involved in rebooting and refining a dozen or so maps available for Zombie Panic: Source, I think the effort should be made. I remember several that were quite excellent that I'd like to see make the jump into new & revised Contagion versions, especially with some of the new mechanics granting the classics some new (undead?) life.\n\n2) There needs to be a mechanism to allow unlimited & a selectable number of zombie respawns in Escape mode - sometimes when the randomizer hands the humans a large amount of ammunition and better weaponry early in the map it's impossible for a small number of player zombies (if any humans die at all) to provide much challenged to a well armed troupe.\n\n3) There needs to be voting mechanisms for the usual - key settings, map change, kicking offending players, etc.\n\nI haven't played much of the third mode, Extraction, where you must help Counter-Strike-esque "Survivors" (I still call them hostages on VOIP in game half the time) hold out in a house until extraction arrives, then escort the survivors to the extraction point, and then a new house gets chosen with more surivors, repeat. As in the other modes, as players die they become Alpha Zombies, making it more difficult to protect the AI survivors. The zombies seem to swarm the hold out point, so a successful strategy I've seen a lot use it to sprint in quick, get the hostages, er survivors to follow you, then run out of the house with them to another part of the neighborhood until the extraction arrives. As the survivors escape, they toss out a pittance of ammunition and the occasional weapon. Since you can only enter the house activated as the hold out point, equipping is rough with a full set of eight or more players, and the escaping survivors don't provide enough resupply (by far) for the mode. I don't know if there's a fixed number of survivors to rescue, or if it just keeps going until all the players / survivors die - just haven't played enough to know.","January 2, 2014","true","485.6"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zombient/recommended/238430/","zombient","Number of F2P Teams Today: 11","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zombient/","462 products in account","Why this game is one of the best Zombie games out there. I'll run down the pro's and con's of this game. First thing up...\n\n-Pros-\n1. The first actual feeling of 'survival' I've ever got from a game. There's no crosshairs. There's no mini-map (unless you call the GPS for a few game modes a mini-map).\n\n2. The game is hard. But then again, surviving millions of walking dead people who are trying to eat you, isn't going to be easy. I like that. The game isn't  a cake walk.\n\n3. The game requires teamwork. If you don't work with the living, you're going to end up dead.\n\n4. No OP special zombies. Once you die, you become a zombie. You don't have any voodoo witchcraft that's going to turn you into a magical flying 500 pound zombie.\n\n5. You actually need the flashlight in this game. I can't tell you how many zombie games I've played where you have a flashlight, but there's reall no need for it.\n\n6. Shoot for the brain, not just the head. This also makes it hard for new players, which I guess could be considered a downfall. Headshots don't do a damn thing. You have to shoot/hit the brain. You shoot the chin? Nothing. You shoot the cheek? Nothing. Hit the brain.\n\n7. The workshop is expanding and it's incredibly easy to submit your own work. I've even done it myself.\n\n8. Detail. The maps are beautiful and complex.\n\n9. Not one game is ever the same. The map will change up between every round. On Escape, if you die one round and try it again, you will have to take a different route. Same with the weapons, they won't be in the same place.\n\n-Cons-\n\n1. There could be more maps. There's only a handfull of maps right now, but the makers of the game did say that they were going to come out with 2 free DLC packs. I would guess this comes with new maps. But what do you expect? Some peope complain that there are not enough maps, ignoring the fact that this is not an AAA title. It's made by a small group of developers.\n\n2. Kinda hard to find some games in some game modes. Hunted is by far the most popular game type. Humans Vs Humans Vs Zombies. It's great. But other game modes usually don't have any players. Really hope the game becomes more popular over time.\n\n3. Not enough servers with custom content.\n\nThat's about it! Please, don't only read the bad reviews and Metacritic is notorious for giving great games less than great reviews.\n\nThis is by far my favorite zombie survival game.","October 29, 2013","true","101.8"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Madface-/recommended/238430/","Madface-","Rome","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Madface-/","131 products in account","If you're looking at this you're probably wondering if the game is worth a buy, 20$ may seem very expensive to those who don't have the luxury to just go out and buy games without a doubt while it may seem like pocket change to others.\n\nConsidering this is my first review please take this with a grain of salt.\n\nWhy should I consider buying Contagion?\nYou should buy Contagion because It's fun, it provides an environment where cooperation is key, while that may seem like a generic statement across all sorts of zombie survival games, seriously, in this one, it is. If your friends die they become zombies and ultimately that makes your gameplay a whole lot more difficult because that one player zombie can infect another player and they're count goes up one by one until the last person is left cowering in a corner before she/he is mauled to death by a horde. A lot of players who prefer the old slow zombies and freakish hordes of them will like this game in its entirety.\n\nContagion challenges the players in a multitude of gamemodes such as...\nEscape - Which you could say is the traditional left 4 dead style, "Let's go do some objectives so we can get out of here." type of thing.\nExtract - If you have ever played Resident Evil 3, this is the mercenary mode where you run around extracting civilains.\nHunt - You versus everything else pretty much.\nZombie Panic Classic - If you have ever played the Free to Play Zombie Panic Source, this is basically the same.\nZombe Panic Objective - The same as Zombie Panic Source's objective escape mode, it's Escape in Contagion too but this time it's you versus a player zombie at the start.\nStopping with the possibly ranting non-sense, lets get on with this review. First of all, the store page in comparison to real gameplay.\n\nStore Page Advertising in Comparison to Real Gameplay\nIf you've read the section "What they're saying about Contagion" which is the first section of the store page for reviewers it's basically saying that Contagion is a good game that has gone back to the old style slow zombie game that is worth the 20$ it's worth. But is that really true?\n\nMy Experience in relation to this statement.\nYes, Contagion has done that and so far I've liked the game, even in the most frustrating moments I've had fun running around popping zombies in the head once or beating them with a melee weapon of my choice. But that is me however, how would it be for you the player?\n\nContagion may be fun for a good majority of the possible people willing to throw money at the developers so that they can play however a there is also the fact a lot of people have said that the game is terrible, the graphics are bad, the gameplay sucks, gore is 'meh' and it's been an overall bad experience. Hell, the two first reviews I saw of Contagion had said that it was a bad game and there was only one good review. But these reviews were a bit old, like, months back old so I decided to write one myself.\n\nIn all seriousness, if you have a problem with graphics, any game developed for the Source Engine is gonna look bad in some way so you should save yourself the time and money and just ignore this game all together. If you're cool with it, enjoy.\n\nGameplay wise, if you have everything going for you and you have a smart team to play with, even on the most hardest difficulties you will steam roll through zombie hordes and make it to the end with minimum casualties if not zero. That is probably the biggest aspect of the game I consider that makes it fun for anyone to play it really. Teamwork is essential in this game and if you're not a teamplayer, you're gonna get wiped quick and you'll probably get mad very easily at this game because being mauled by a horde of zombies isn't fun, not for you, not for anyone and not even for your teammates across the map. Because when you die, they'll have to deal with you and any player zombie is more fiendish than an NPC in a horde.\n\nThe Gore is decent, it's not gonna rock you and have blood spraying everywhere but the limbs will fall off I assure you this. It's also toggable so if you have children who want to play feel free to turn of it. Then again, why are you subjecting your child to such a violent gorish videogame like Contagion?\n\nOverall Experience of Contagion? It's pretty good, I wouldn't say 'decent' because the only time I would ever say 'decent' if it was a 50/50 that everything was going right and everything was going wrong at that point. With my 'small' experience of Contagion gameplay I can only say this. It's good because discluding the idiotic players, the twit taking things he doesn't need and the relatively low chance of getting trolled by a zombie because you've emptied a magazine into his head, it's pretty good.\n\nThe only things you need to worry about in the game is the things I just discluded, the dumb or should I say, learning players, the trolls, the hoarder of ammo and the trollish hitboxes preventing you from ending the zombies life. Those are the only things that are going to ruin your day, mostly the trollish hitboxes on the zombies. Other than that, the players tend to listen and stick together but you will usually always have the one guy who decided to hoard everything and not share one bit of it.\n\nDynamic Gameplay\nWhat they've said is true in terms of finding weapons or objectives but the map layout tends to be the same and you will usually have a deja vu moment here and there. It will always be new in terms of trying to find the objective in the various places they put it as well as the pathways you take to that objective but other than that the map will remain the same. I honestly thought the map would be different like they made blocks of the maps that would interlock easily and would create a whole new environment all together.\n\nEdit 9/2/2014 - Added a little bit concerning the pathways to objectives will always be different.\n\nState Of The Art Gore\nI would say that this would be true in terms of it described but I honestly don't think it's state of the art, you could really compare this to Deadspace's limbic system when you utterly destroyed the monsters.\n\nImmersive Sound Effects\nThis I would consider to be definetly true, I never got to a point where I ran through the game without even thinking, I was always cautious because the obvious zombie moans around the corner usually prepared me to get mauled to death.\n\nTraditional Zombies\nYes, yes, yes. Spot on though I'd have to say, they can climb ladders and get into vents? Seems a bit new to me in terms of what zombies could do...\n\nExtensive Survival Equipment\nI'd have to say, this really disappointed me. I expected there to be a multitude of items to use as a weapon and it severely disappointed me when I enter a store and there's all this hardware I could use as a possible weapon but they didn't consider it. They did however say that they would continue to add so I suspect more in the future.\n\nUnique Gamemodes\nI don't know if Unique meant that the experience in itself would be unique each time or that each game mode was unique. This statement is basically what I explained up top if you've missed it, other than that, I don't know how to respond to this literally.\n\nStop Paying More\nHurray! What else am I supposed to say?\n\nI'll probably add more to this review later on in the future, overall I have to say 9/10, the game is really fun when things are on your side, that can be said for a lot of games though.\n\nIn the end, it's your choice whether or not you want to buy it or not. Hopefully this review is on your side and you don't have a horrible experience.","September 1, 2014","true","35.8"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

At last we have a game where the zombies can only be dispatched by shooting them in the head! I am suprised this has not been done before, as it not only says true to the greatest zombie triology of all time, but more importantly, it rewards player accuracy.\n\nThe game offers a fantastic atmosphere, good gun mechanics and some interesting maps. What stands out from this game is the fantastic 'hunted' mode, which is essentially a last man standing PVP deathmatch with NPC zombies. However, it has a slight twist, in that when a player dies, they come back playing as a zombie. I loved the PVP element of 'Day Z', so this game mode was perfect for me. At present, I would even go as far as saying that the battles on this game are better, because the game mechanics are so fluid and the zombies are actually a threat.\n\nContagion is by no means perfect though, for starters, the objective game modes are hit and miss. Although the player is told what to do by a mobile phone, it is often not clear what the objective actually is, or where the player should go. The game is crying out for more maps, which I am sure will come when/if it gets workshop support. Also, I am hoping that the developers adapt the current barracading system, so that players can actually move objects (at present you can only place wooden boards).\n\n\nOverall, this is a decent addition to the genre. Perhaps the amount of content does not justify the full price tag, but it is definitely worth picking up in the sale for the 'hunted' gameplay mode. Hopefully it will develop and maintain a healthy player count.\n\n7.5/10","June 23, 2014","true","23.7"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

The overall atmosphere of the game is amazing, and the PVP free for all gamemode (hunted) is terrifyingly fun. It's like DayZ in the fact that it's you versus everyone plus zombies. Except, when people die, they actually join the ranks of the undead. There's nothing more intense than roaming a zombie-filled neighborhood, breaking into a house, checking your phone, and realizing you're not the only living person in the house. Then you see one of the bedroom doors open...\n\nThe only downside is that it's still in its beta stages, so there's bugs here and there, like the occasional zombie model freezing in place or just a hitbox mishap.

Directions are way too vague for escape, which is actually one of the best modes.

The zombie game that will revolutionize the genre once again.\n\nStraight from the developers of the ever so popular mod, Zombie Panic!: Source, lies this gem, Contagion.\n\nContagion is the definition of the first few days of a zombie apocalypse. No other zombie games I know of can capture the immersion of an atmosphere so dark, and cold. No other game captures the direct feeling of when a gunshot rings off in the distance, or a scream s heard across the open landscape. Or even... when it's a dead, dreadful, silence.\nThe use of modern technology in this game is a neat and clever idea, using a smart phone to get info and help you on your quest makes it feel as if this can happen at any given moment, right now.\n\nNow, for gameplay mechanics and good things:\n\nYou go up to a zombie. You shoot a bullet, thinking everything will be alright, as if this was Left 4 Dead. It resounds through the area and zombies reply with a big, fat "NOPE" as many rush over fences and break open windows to munch on a newfound meal. The sounds in this game are amazing, as they immerse you and give you that extra feel as if you're really there. Buildings have that nice echo that make you feel at home, then zombies are barreling through the door at the slightest loud noise that you may drum up.\nAs of this review, you can now be infected by AI Zombies' physical attacks. It's very easy now to get infected. Now, you know that noone will have the heart EVER to tell someone they are going to turn, so they sit there, and they go throguh the symptoms. Then, their cries of agony fill the air, and it turns to a gurgle as their human qualities vanish and they lunge for their friends before your very eyes. It's a horrible feeling when you've been traveling with your friends for miles through the cities, and behind you, one of your friends is gone.\nIt's cold.\n\nNow, for some flaws, because this is a review and I have to cover things good, AND bad.\n\nFor one, and I know this will be fixed, is that there are so little maps that the replay value gets a little repetitive after a while. Now I'm sure the team is working avidly on new maps, especially co-op maps, but as of now, little co-op maps.\nThere are some bugs, but this is all really stuff that will be fixed. I'm glad the team is really proud of this and I have all the respect for them.\n\nIn conclusion, Contagion will reach for the stars for reviving the zombie genre. It's atmosphere is spot on, and it makes you feel isolated and helpless, which is what we wanetd ever since we've cracked open the pages of the Zombie Survival Guide. I hope this game makes history, and if it doesn't I will take a hot steaming crap on Steam.\n\n11/10\nBuy this game, and get it for your friends. You will not regret it.\n--------------------------\n\nAlso, I guess I deviate from the norm, as for the record I think Hunted is stupid, unlike everyone else. ._.\nYeah, flame me.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/coldverycold/recommended/238430/","coldverycold","Death059","http://steamcommunity.com/id/coldverycold/","168 products in account","NOTE: This review was written 5/3/2014, things may have been subject to change.\n\nThis is it, folks. The zombie game that will revolutionize the genre once again.\n\nStraight from the developers of the ever so popular mod, Zombie Panic!: Source, lies this gem, Contagion.\n\nContagion is the definition of the first few days of a zombie apocalypse. No other zombie games I know of can capture the immersion of an atmosphere so dark, and cold. No other game captures the direct feeling of when a gunshot rings off in the distance, or a scream s heard across the open landscape. Or even... when it's a dead, dreadful, silence.\nThe use of modern technology in this game is a neat and clever idea, using a smart phone to get info and help you on your quest makes it feel as if this can happen at any given moment, right now.\n\nNow, for gameplay mechanics and good things:\n\nYou go up to a zombie. You shoot a bullet, thinking everything will be alright, as if this was Left 4 Dead. It resounds through the area and zombies reply with a big, fat "NOPE" as many rush over fences and break open windows to munch on a newfound meal. The sounds in this game are amazing, as they immerse you and give you that extra feel as if you're really there. Buildings have that nice echo that make you feel at home, then zombies are barreling through the door at the slightest loud noise that you may drum up.\nAs of this review, you can now be infected by AI Zombies' physical attacks. It's very easy now to get infected. Now, you know that noone will have the heart EVER to tell someone they are going to turn, so they sit there, and they go throguh the symptoms. Then, their cries of agony fill the air, and it turns to a gurgle as their human qualities vanish and they lunge for their friends before your very eyes. It's a horrible feeling when you've been traveling with your friends for miles through the cities, and behind you, one of your friends is gone.\nIt's cold.\n\nNow, for some flaws, because this is a review and I have to cover things good, AND bad.\n\nFor one, and I know this will be fixed, is that there are so little maps that the replay value gets a little repetitive after a while. Now I'm sure the team is working avidly on new maps, especially co-op maps, but as of now, little co-op maps.\nThere are some bugs, but this is all really stuff that will be fixed. I'm glad the team is really proud of this and I have all the respect for them.\n\nIn conclusion, Contagion will reach for the stars for reviving the zombie genre. It's atmosphere is spot on, and it makes you feel isolated and helpless, which is what we wanetd ever since we've cracked open the pages of the Zombie Survival Guide. I hope this game makes history, and if it doesn't I will take a hot steaming crap on Steam.\n\n11/10\nBuy this game, and get it for your friends. You will not regret it.\n--------------------------\n\nAlso, I guess I deviate from the norm, as for the record I think Hunted is stupid, unlike everyone else. ._.\nYeah, flame me. I'm ready.\n*holds up AR-15*","May 3, 2014","true","115.4"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","1"

Servers are usually laggy, game has barely changed over a year, zombie hitboxes are awful, player zombies are completely overpowered, list goes on and on and on.\nAlthough you might have some initial fun popping zombie heads, the more you play, the more obvious the problems become. Playing escape always tells you to go hunting for small items across an entire maps like keys, so you have to backtrack for most escape maps, and you basically bumble around for 20 minutes, die, then do it again as a zombie until the round ends. Directions are way too vague for escape, which is actually one of the best modes. The rest of the game mode are meh except for hunted, until player zombies win the match for everyone.\n\nPlay No more room in hell instead, it's free and it's at least 78.54% more fun than this overpriced mess.\n\nTL;DR\nGets boring after a while,\nzombie hitboxes are broken + player zombies op\nGamemodes are pretty boring\nGET NO MORE ROOM IN HELL","July 6, 2015","false","8.6"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

I didn't have the cash to purchase it at the time but a friend of mine actually gifted it as a present and I was on my way. At first glance getting into the game was quite interesting with different styles of maps, modes, and objectives. My personal favorite were escape modes which is pretty self explanatory. After getting well adjusted into the game I decide to move up to harder difficulty seeing as that was the only viable option instead of doing straight PVP (hunted). Reason being the overall game lacked content so you often found yourself in repetitive situations ultimately remembering specific locations to give yourself an edge versus other players. To my surprise the difficulty was quite challenging however certain mechanics left the overall experience bland if not just right out horrible. Some examples of this were random disconnections, hit-box for zombie head-shots, and the overwhelming powerful armored zombie that required an large amount of ammo to take down if you aren't good at using melee attack (which by the way wasn't an easy task on extreme). Putting that aside, another problem facing this game was the community. Now, by community I mean specifically the typical run-of-the-mill ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s you'd often see in any online game. See, this wouldn't be such an issues however, with the open mic feature and team killing enabled... Well let's just say the overall game experience dropped to below average. You'd often join games hoping to have some fun but run into horrible people that would kill you on purpose, disconnect and reconnect (which auto-turns you into a zombie) to sabotage the team, or have players just abuse the mic privileges by spewing some toxic things out of their mouths. Now, in order to have fun in this game emphasis on teamwork is required without doubt, it is a must or the game becomes virtually impossible to complete or even be slightly successful at (speaking for average players). To put things in perspective, ultimately the game itself will fall into one of these headings for the majority of players either death by fellow teammate, accidental shots (leading into arguments), players turning into zombie (on purpose), players throwing away valuable in-game-items needed progress (by hiding it), player stalling the game when everyone is dead (on purpose) by hiding in specific areas before progressing to far, players mass looting all items which should be shared leading to the teams inevitable death, or completing the game successfully without any issues. In team-based games such as this one, it is important to work together to better the overall gaming experience however Contagion fails to really address these issues thus the problem persist even today. Granted there is a mute feature which is nice but doesn't do justice. So, in conclusion, if you decide to play this game with friends consider it a decent game but overall short (content wise). If you decide to play by yourself, consider yourself warned and tread lightly. The game itself would best be described as a "pick-up" game in which you can start and stop at any time with no real commitment towards progression or anything of that nature. If you find yourself in the long-haul playing a lot more (for the competitive gamer) I'd recommend a pass on this game altogether, save yourself a headache personally. There are much better games out there. I don't recommend this game.","July 11, 2014","false","133.6"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","6","10","0","0"

Trust me, this game is worth your money.\n\nThe only thing I can complain about is the fact that they were going to launch a DLC pack in October and it's May now and it still isn't released, I'm not sure what complicated things but I'm sure they have a good reason. they've been keeping the game bug free. You should definitely buy this.","December 23, 2013","true","95.9"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

If you have played any zombie game then you have played this. What the dev's will tell you is that the game is complete. Thats a lie. For starters let me preface by saying i play every type of game and strive to do the best at them. So i have mastered first person shooters. let alone zombie games. I know to aim at the brain and im accurate enough to hit it everytime. However in this game the brain hitbox is not the best, many times i have accurately hit the brain only to have nothing happen. Shotguns destroy flesh in real life however in this game they are the worst weapons, they do nothing. This goes for melee weapons as well. choping off arms doesnt do anything as they still hit you with phantom limbs. When you die you turn into a zombie and are pretty much unstoppable, and when you die as a zombie you respawn as another zombie making the game really unenjoyable. You are pretty much a tank. The NPC zombies always get stuck on something or each other. You cant climb down ladders.\n\nThere are many problems with this game.\nAll in all its a bad No More Room In Hell knock off.\nWith so many zombie games out, this is nothing new or creative.","December 31, 2014","false","8.7"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","6","10","0","0"

I bought this in early access and I enjoyed the game, even though it wasn't "good" in my opinion.\n\nCONS\n\n-The gun gameplay is BAD and the game has the worst rifle scope in history, wich makes it very scary to use since all the zombies in the medium sized maps of this game will come knocking at your door when you shoot even one bullet.\n\n-Not many players in multiplayer, which makes it difficult (for me at least) to find a server with good ping.\n\n-The zombies lag! This is a major and a common problem in zombie games. I haven't seen a zombie game with zombie hordes where the zombies wouldn't lag, with the exeption of Black Ops zombies. This is not my computers fault since it runs everything quite well.\n\n-Too much 3d anaglyph.. At first on early access the amount of it was good and it gave the game a little bit more realistic feel. Now there is just too much of it though. It is ditorting and confusing.\n\nPROS\n\n+Mods! This game has mods, which can of course make it better by some amount. In the other hand there aren't too many of them, because there aren't that many players either..\n\n+Well it has zombies and CO-OP, so if you like those things you will enjoy this game to some extent like I did, even though it is a little unpolished and crappy :P\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThis is Steam, so buy it on sale if you really like co-op zombie games. The game can be enjoyable, but i wouldn't recommend it.\n\n\n","December 27, 2014","false","17.3"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","7","12","0","0"

You spawn in a random location on the map, and your objective is to stay alive the longest. Scavenge the abandoned houses along the way, but beware - hitting B as a human brings up your phone, and you and other players can see who is close aswell as get a buzzing noise when hitting the trigger. If you die you will respawn as a zombie and your only task is to bring down the remaining survivors. Last survivor alive wins the round.\n\nEscape - Band together with friends and strangers in this Survivor vs AI / PC zombies. Your phone will let you know what objective you need to accomplish and your main goal is to escape from the map. Weapons, ammo and items will be found along the way. Make sure you check every corner as they are sometimes hidden or you need to progress further to unlock the areas they are in.\n\nExtraction - Survivor vs AI / PC zombies where your goal is to follow the GPS on your map and find survivors held up in houses. Once you reach a holdout point, vast amounts of zombies will begin spawning, so share your ammo and your weapons with your friends, as each member of your team that gets killed will come back as one of the ravenous corpses coming to eat you. Round ends when all survivor packs have been extracted, or the zombies kill either all Player survivors or NPC survivors in a pack.\n\nPanic (Objective) - The P:O mode was taken from the spiritual prequel Zombie Panic! Source, another game worth picking up as it's free, and features a strictly PS vs PZ combat zone, where the survivors need to complete the objectives much like in Escape.\n\nPanic (Classic) The original game mode from ZP!S which just like the Objective mode features only player combat.

Zombies have limited lives and the first player to turn becomes the strong Riot Zombie.\n\nHappy hunting and good luck surviving!","June 21, 2014","true","87.7"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","0"

Its kind of fun with limited maps and gamemodes but the fps aspect is horribly innaccurate. Would not reccomend mostly due to weak game mechanics. There are no working vehicles, the trailer I watched said that you can throw coins to conserve ammo which is only true if you are using cheats. All of the maps are pretty straight forward (not at all openworld in anysense) and I have not once played a round where I did not have an excess of 45+ rounds for the standard handgun (Not to mention any 3 other guns I might have.)\nAll of the zombies are the same height so anytime there is more then 5 of them coming at you, all you need to do is walk through any doorway and they will line up for you.\n\nIf you want to shoot mindless zombies who shuffle straight towards you in almost a single file line with excess ammo and no need for a team, then this is the game for you. Mindless headshots is a big part of the game. However the guns are really innaccurate. I dont expect to be able to snipe with a handgun but I should atleast be able to hit a non-moving target that is 15feet away.\n\nAlso, they have 1 map that is endless waves of zombies but if you arent using cheats, you are limited to about 30 - 45 bullets and they recreated the map from the first nazi zombies. They didnt add all of the furnature and stuff, but it is the exact same game mode and map layout.\n\nI give Contagion 3/10\n\n5/22/2014","May 10, 2014","false","109.6"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","8","14","0","0"

Even after a year of playing Contagion I'm still not tired with it. This apocalyptic gem features a few different levels to play with your friends whether you want co-op or pvp.\n\nTry to escape a police station before the undead horde claims all of your lives, and if you get left for dead come back as one of the horde to hunt down your ex survivors. Take a spin at pvp. Sure shooters can be fun, but when you throw neutral zombies in the mix its not so easy to just run and gun. If you're one for the classics give panic a shot. Trust me after you play it you'll know why they call it that.\n\nThis beauty of a game has so much good content already, but it doesn't stop there. These game maker guys throw in some cool updates every now and then to give us new weapon, maps, characters even gamemodes *cough cough flatline*.\n\nStop hesitating and buy it already.

I paid full price for it and I felt confused and annoyed by almost everthing I tried to do. After investing a reasonable amount of playtime into this game, I am happy to say now that I thoroughly enjoy this game. That is why I would really like for more people to buy this game and play it. This game deserves to be more popular. Furthermore, the game is on sale right now so people will be checking it out and there has never been a better time to join if you have considered it. For those reasons I have decided to provide what I think is a good recipe for getting started in Contagion.\n\n1. The first thing you should do is go to start game and select the hunted game mode on any map. Choose solo play, turn infection off, and put the difficulty on easy. You will be dropped into a map with randomly generated zombies and a decent amount of weapons and ammo laying around for you to pick up. Hunted is a pvp game mode and since you are playing solo, this will be a good way for you to just run around aimlessly killing zombies and familiarizing yourself with the gameplay and the maps. Do this until you get tired of it and feel ready for the game to get more intense.\n\n2. Now that you have gotten a feel for the game, go to find game, select hunted as the game mode, and join the first server that pops up. From here you will be looking to find and kill the other living characters (not zombies). This is a lot of fun, for beginners and vets alilke. Since your new, you may or may not get killed early, but thats ok since you get to come back from the dead to seek retribution against the living. Basically you get to play the entire time without having to sit and wait just because you died,\n\n3. Have you made any friends yet? If so, check out some of the escape maps and see if they want to play. If not, check out some escape maps anyway, pay attention to your phone, but dont expect it to spell out all the information you need, your gonna need to figure things out on your own.\n\n4. After logging some time in the game, now you are ready to try your skills at extraction. Try to find and save the survivors, but be warned, it gets intense. Just remember to wait for other players before entering the extraction points, as you will need their help when the hoards start to arrive. Not to mention if you go running straight into the houses without waiting for the others, it kinda ruins the game for everyone.\n\n5. Have nothing to note on the panic game modes since it's pvp and I've never found a server playing them, looks like it might be fun though. Check this game out!! Happy gaming everyone!","June 17, 2015","true","76.6"," 10 of 18 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","10","18","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DarK_St3alth/recommended/238430/","DarK_St3alth","DarK_St3alth","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DarK_St3alth/","183 products in account","Rank: 6/10\nRecommendation(s): Buy on sale, don't think this is a triple A title, and live in New York or beside server host.\nMajor Theme: Significant lack of professionalism.\nBought at Price: $0 - Gifted when $3\n\nThere's quite a list of things to touch on, so let's get right to it.\n\nI have always been a big fan of Source powered titles, and even more so of mods going pro level. This title is a big let down, and I certainly hope it improves quickly. To me, licencing and using the Source engine means serious work. The developers are willing to step up to the AAA level and deliver. So far, development has been very amateurish, almost what I would expect from a Source mod.\n\nBeing SteamWorks enabled, the download and install process was easy. On launching the game, I was shocked and confused as to why I am seeing a notice about RAM requirements.\n\nThis original shows the situation hasn't improved:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=208377744\n\nFrom what you see today:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=248206376\n\nIf you are having issues understanding (which is the case with many) what the issue is, please read this little bit. The game notifies me that the OS is reporting there's 4087MB of RAM to use, yet the game needs a minimum 4064MB.\n\nTieing back into the amateurish development, it seems that the developers can't even do simple math; is 4087 bigger then 4064? I'm not sure why this hasn't been resolved or if it will ever be, but it's scary to think that it has passed through not only QA (quality assurance) but the project lead and programmers as well.\n\nTalking about testing and QA, a recent issue came up of kill reporting. If you were to throw a grenade bound to kill someone, and switch to another weapon, you will find that the server reports back that the person was killed with the actively selected weapon.\n\nI hate going on about the QA, so let's move to another topic. How about effects for show?\n\nThroughout my education to date and programming experience, I was always told "simple is best". There's no need to overly complicate things or add things "just for show". Sadly, Contagion falls into this trap. What I call the "dirty lens effect", doesn't make any logical sense. This effect is used when characters have glasses or a protective visor on. When used correctly it can add that extra level of immersion, knowing that you are looking out of a visor. Last time I checked, none (or the vast majority) of characters didn't have a visor or glasses on. So why include it? What was the gain from adding an effect that doesn't have sound backing? It's just yet another questionable move by the amateurish development team.\n\nI can't bash the game that much, because gameplay wise, it's nice to see some fresh elements in an over crowded and over saturated zombie genre. The cell phone dynamic/mechanic allows for greater immersion, and removes the need for HUD elements. Operation can be odd due to the key bindings.\n\nRescuing trapped survivors was another fresh idea, but again has a failing in it. While they added the ability for the AI to defend themselves, they tend to shoot each other if one is in the line of fire.\n\nJumping into the most worldly debated topic of "PvE" and "PvP" (which I don't agree with the terms) would seem logical at this point. The hunter maps seem to be random, but don't provide enough randomness to prevent players learning the how many different combinations to gain an advantage. I vouch for games that focus on player skills, rather then easy memorization. Sadly, memorization is the is the only skill really required and doesn't allow for fair play.\n\nThe randomness the title does provide in the "hunted" gamemode seems to be unbalancing. Some players are given the more powerful 1911, where as others are given the weaker Sig Sauer. While the round progresses, this doesn't matter that much, but early on can certainly provide an unfair advantage. There's no counter balance to the 1911 early game, because you don't need that much ammo to kill targets.\n\nOn that topic, due to using a certain server host, latency can be a real game killer. Valve tends to spread their servers out, and have enough in reserve to get people playing. This is not the case with Contagion. Either there's an issue with the server host or game code, but you can end up playing on a UK server while sitting on the far side of North America. Not sure how many of you have done this, but let's say 130ms makes shots and server-client prediction interesting.\n\n"Early Beta" for the team was really more of an excuse then a development status. Besides the ambiguity caused by using "early", it just seems that there was (and continutes to be) a significant lack of professionalism.\n\nSo there you have it. All the major issues, and the unfortunate lack of positives. Throughout the whole review, I keep going back to the idea of "amateurish development". It's the biggest idea that screams out the most when playing the title.","June 16, 2014","false","13.1"," 10 of 18 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","10","18","0","1"

An earnest mess with plenty of chances to grief other players. Such as taking all the ammo in the house the survivors are holed up in and throwing it out the window at the zombie horde. Glitching the door to keep the zombies out of my hiding spot so the round continues forever. Knocking over zombie-built ledges so the zombies can't have any soft, lovely human flesh.\n\nContagion is a much more developed take on Zombie Panic: Source. And the only reason I've wanted to play it beyond the first moment was because of the Hunted game mode. Hunted is where players fight zombies, temporarily team up to find safe places, and then turn on each other. Or you can play it like I do, which is shoot everybody I see while reading their angry text through a drunk voice. It allows for developer-sponsored griefing, and that's a plus.\n\nUnfortunately the rest of the game outside of Hunted is pretty damn boring and riddled with flaws. The most egregious flaw for me would be the mapping. The mapping is pretty wasteful, having entire stretches of street and all these buildings and not really doing anything with them except using them as scenery. I'd rather have smaller, more functional maps than wide ones with nothing to really offer. What's more, they make the objective-based missions tedious and confusing to navigate. We knew there was a gun shop, but we had no idea where to go, which meant we had to spend ten minutes to locate the shop and then take another ten just to get there.\n\nThe part of the game that made me stop playing was the netcode freezing the game. It wasn't lag, but something in the netcode that made the game freeze and wait for the server to catch up and give everybody the game data. This got extremely annoying when I was scoring headshots up close and personal with a zombie horde. I was popping my gat at zombie heads, then my game froze, and then the game told me I had stood there while the zombies nibbled at my gun hand and now I was a zombie. The kind of thing that makes me want to eat my mouse in frustration.\n\nAnd worst of all: Zombies are still a god damn chore to play. Even with the ability to control hordes, order them around, jump on other players from behind and give them a big old kiss! They are still so damn boring, because you have to find the human players to kill them, which means you have to hoof your decaying ♥♥♥ towards gun noises and hope there's a tasty human to kill. Which is why I kill every human player I see. I say I am friendly and then shoot them, because my bullets are friendly too. They are like tiny little lead puppy dogs.\n\nAnyway, don't bother.","August 30, 2014","false","2.9"," 44 of 85 people (52%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","52","44","85","5","0"

Cool idea to be able to barricade yourself inside, wich aint new, but seriously its a pain to patch a window when zombies dont stop coming out of it, you need to switch back and forth with guns and nailgun.

Well, you've found Contagion.\n\nContagion is a survival horror game with zombie virus as theme, and has online multiplayer support, both co-op against the AI and playing against human zombies. Different modes for different gameplays. You can escape a building full of infected zombies and scarce resource, cross a city looking for a safe place, escort civilians out of a small town or even go crazy and play with your friends as humans and zombies. If you are looking for multiple gameplays, I'm happy to tell you the items and the scenario changes, forcing you to handle different threats and unexpected situations. The game really has this aura that brings you into the survival mood. It makes you want to save ammo, to stick together with your friends, to work as a team.\n\nI recommend Contagion. It has a lot the features and the atmosphere of a survival horror, and brings the best of your solo or co-op play. Its only downside is the need of more maps. Most particularly for the "Escape" game mode.","December 10, 2014","true","27.4"," 17 of 32 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","17","32","0","0"

There is nothing you haven't seen and some of the standard elements you might find in a game like this are missing.\n\n1.  There are only about 8 character models - one for each character you can choose from and one infected version of these characters.  These are recylced over and over making for a stale, non-emersive experience.\n\n2.  The models are all low res and don't have the visceral feel of something like Dead Island or Dead Rising.  Not a lot of blood.  No dangling body parts.  Sorta like the bad painted face zombies of the early 1980s.\n\n3.  The mechanics are a little clunky.  I don'y know how you can take the source engine and make it less elegant but they managed it.\n\n4.  Resources are limited and this is good and bad.  I did feel the need to scrounge and save resources but this was partially due to the fact that standard things you might expect are not in the game.   Example - see all that food in the cafeteria?  You might want to eat it to gain some health or at least some stamina buff.  Nope.  Non-interactable.  There is literally no way to heal yourself - that I found - in the game.  Perhaps there is a particular character that is a medic, which would increase team play, but that is not made clear to you in the character selection if so.  I found no method of healing in the game itself - no food, med packs, etc.\n\n5.  The environment is bland and interaction options limited making for a non-emersive experience.  Kill a cop zmobie?  no ammo or gun on him.  See that knife sticking out of the dead zombie's head?  Yeah you can't use that.  Unlike most half-life/source mods, you can't even pickup and throw any objects in the room.\n\n6.  Stamina system is fine but is pretty unimaginative.  It's a standard mechanic in a lot of survival games now and it makes sense.  But then you have other standard survival horror mechanics missing.  Example - your flashlights have unlimited batteries.\n\n7.  Probably the most disappointing part of this game is melee combat.  You have a regular attack and a charge attack.  While you reel from being hit, the zmobies do not.  Even wielding a large sledge hammer, your melee range is about the length of a small toothpick.   The sneak attack thing is highly buggy and this is exasperated by a really underdeveloped stealth system.  If the dev. wanted this to be a part of the game play, the execution needs to be on par with something like State of Decay, Skyrim, or Dishonored.  No stealth or awareness indicator.  The stealth attack can only be executed when you are directly behind the zombie and this often still doesn't work due to environment clipping issues.\n\nFinal analysis - pass on this.  I gave it a try on the free weekened and glad I didn't spend a dime on it.  With so many other titles in the zombie genre that are quite solid (although I am still waiting for that perfect zombie game), this one is rather forgetable.","August 31, 2014","false","0.9"," 95 of 186 people (51%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","51","95","186","6","13"

From the shakey graphics, to the horrible weapon control, and most unforgivably: the lack of any direction to the gamemodes, make this a chore.\n\nThe only enjoyment I had was on the missions where you have to rescue survivors. In that game mode, the game actually tells you where to go (rather than dropping you in a poorly designed, random, confusing maze) - and there is a nice element of survival boarding up windows and such. But there's only 2 maps for this mode, and the AI you have to save are dumb as a brick.\n\nWorth a punt in a sale, but certainly doesn't justify the £15 price tag.","November 19, 2014","false","3.5"," 33 of 64 people (52%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","52","33","64","3","6"

There are smaller more fast paced maps (the park map) or the suburb map which is much more suspenseful and involves a bit of hide and seek (you can board up a house and hide in the garage like a little girl). it never gets too boring cause you can always check your mobile phone which will tell you if people are around you and will give you audio clues about their location.\n\nEscape - an objective based mode which takes place in a prison. the objectives are generated randomly and item placements change so in one play through you might be escaping from the garage and the other might get you up to the roof to a chopper. it is very suspensful and revolves around ammo conservation and team work. the diffculty level could be higher but maybe that's a setting I haven't found yet.\n\nExtraction - revolves around helping NPCs escaping, haven't played it much so i can't really speak about it\n\nIf you like first person multiplayer games and enjoyed old school hl2/hl mods that experiment in gameplay this is for you.","December 3, 2013","true","21.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game contains good puzzles in the escape maps, and it requires a good level of cooperation on the extraction maps.\nAmmo isn't avaliable anywhere, so make any of your shots count, and don't forget to share it with your comrades. This has made this game pretty neat.\nBut hey, now there is the PVP mode. One thing that annoyed me in the past zombie games/mods, was the PVP. One team of humans vs zombies. Just that. Humans could get to high places and spam M4A1 shots on them, making it impossible for zombies to reach, but in Contagion, this is different. The PVP mode is a mix of FFA with a VS and King of the Hill Mode. You have to kill the other players in order to survive, and be advised, all the players begin as humans. Killed some of them? Nice! But watch out, because they will come back from hell as reanimated corpses and hunt you down, and this is one of the best parts on this game: Humans. Are. Not. O.P against the zombies.

Well, I thought I had done everything I could do with Steam and Steam related software that would blow my mind or offer me anything new.  I WAS WRONG.

The team based aspects are highlighted as your fellow players can make or break you.  Definitive zombie FPS? Quite possibly.

Worth the money, if you don't have enough then just wait for the sales, chances are it will be on offer","December 13, 2013","true","56.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is somewhere in between L4D and DayZ.  Escape is my favourite game mode at the moment.  This game forces people to work well as a team which I love.  It is still in early access at the moment; however I have experience no bugs, the game is pretty well polished and I am really enjoying playing it a great deal.  Worth the very fair early access price. AND NO LAG.  I have not experienced any lag at all in multiplayer and neither have any of my friends.

There are smaller more fast paced maps (the park map) or the suburb map which is much more suspenseful and involves a bit of hide and seek (you can board up a house and hide in the garage like a little girl). it never gets too boring cause you can always check your mobile phone which will tell you if people are around you and will give you audio clues about their location.\n\nEscape - an objective based mode which takes place in a prison. the objectives are generated randomly and item placements change so in one play through you might be escaping from the garage and the other might get you up to the roof to a chopper. it is very suspensful and revolves around ammo conservation and team work. the diffculty level could be higher but maybe that's a setting I haven't found yet.\n\nExtraction - revolves around helping NPCs escaping, haven't played it much so i can't really speak about it\n\nIf you like first person multiplayer games and enjoyed old school hl2/hl mods that experiment in gameplay this is for you.","December 3, 2013","true","21.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The mission and routes change on every new level, thus will force you to take new routes and look for hidden ammo. Ammo is rare and you have multiple weapons to look for. There are only a few maps and gamemodes. I personaly love the escape maps with friends and the PvP for online.\nZOMBIES:\nZombies are hard to kill. You can kill a zombie with one bullet in the head, or use 15 rounds on the body (at that may not even kill him!). Zombies are atracted to noise, so you can carefuly sneak by them and move on or perform a sneak kill. Zombies are all over the place, so if you have plenty of ammo and feel like a hero then use your rifles and pistols, that will attracks most of the zombies in the area. But if your team is hurt and are low on ammo, then you can sneak around them too.","December 4, 2013","true","11.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The major reason? It perfectly captures the atmosphere of a Zombie Survival.\n\nWhat I mean is, until you finally succumb to your wounds and the infection takes over, you will try your damndest to survive and help your other survivors, excepting the Hunt PvP game mode. When the infection takes over however, it becomes immensely satisfying to hunt down your friends and bury them beneath a horde of undead. The game really ramps up as soon as a survivor dies, as now one zombie that looks like any other, has human intelligence and wants everyone dead like them.\n\nSo yeah, I like it, and fans of Schadenfreude should too.","January 5, 2015","true","15.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

At first I was pretty skeptical, considering I absolutely hated the Left 4 Dead series.  I'm just generally not a huge fan of the zombie genre (it's overdone imo).  But Contagion feels different.  You, as the player, are more involved.  We've really only played the Escape game mode, which for just the two of us is great.  And it seems a lot of the maps have randomly generated objectives when you play them.  Like some times a door may be blocked, but the next play through you can go through it and explore a different path to escape the map.  It makes replaying maps more enjoyable.\n\nWhen you die, you become a zombie.  It'd say it's more fun on a public server with multiple players, but in a 2-player co-op setting, it's not that fun.  But I can see the effects it would have on a 6+ player server.\n\nAll in all, it's a pretty decent game.","January 10, 2015","true","32.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Now, I'm a big fan of killing zombies, I rarely get tired of putting a shot or a axe in the skull of a zombie. With this in mind, I like what Contagion is, but there are things about it I'm not too crazy about it. Before I go about posting what I think is great about the game, I will start with the things I'm not too crazy about.\n\n1. Forgettable characters - Aside from picking the character you like, that is really about all there is to character selection. There just isn't anything that makes you remember the character beyond it's appearance.\n\n2. Lack of a story - Now I know the game isn't a RPG or anything, but a little bit of story would be nice. Matter of fact it would be a nice way for the character's to be rememberable.\n\n3. Flashlight needs work - Now the flashlight is very handy and by no means am I saying it's useless. However, why can the flashlight not light up rooms? It just seems to light up a small area and jeebus don't get too close to anything in particular with it. The light at the center can just about block out the view of items. You cannot even light up a room for a fellow survivor whose weapon doesn't allow a flashlight fitting.\n\n4. Lack of Zombie variations - Aside from the standard Zombie, player Zombie, and Riot armored zombie. There really isn't anything else of danger around. A Zombie dog would have been a great addition to this game, or even enviromental hazards like falling buildings, out of control cars crashing, or something. A well organized team can easily put down a army of zombies, unless of course they're out of ammo.\n\n5. Ammo hoarders - Don't get me wrong, when you need ammo badly, you need it badly. However, there are people that will pick up ammo for every gun BUT the gun they actually have. I cannot tell you how many times I've been down to one bullet and cannot even get a person to throw a magazine or ammo box my way.\n\n6. Terrible Iron Sights - Now you don't need to serve a tour of duty in a war to tell some of these weapons have terrible iron sights. I've had times where I've woundered if it was easier to shoot from the hip or just aim down sights. Obviously it's better to aim down the sights, but some weapons just have such terrible iron sights it renders players ineffective at times. However, if you get use to the iron sights, you can easily work your way around their terrible design. Out of all the guns, your best bets are on the Pistols, the shotgun, and the hunting rifle. Pistols are semi-automatic, so you can control your rate of fire with them. Shotgun has bad iron sights, but it makes up for it with a wide shot spread so you just need to aim for the head. Heck you may even take down more than one zombie with a single shell. The Hunting rifle zooms in and it's the sniper rifle, so you don't have to deal with iron sights with it.\n\n7. Getting stuck on stuff - This is more of a minor complaint, but there are times that it feels like I get stuck in doorways at times. It looks like I got enough room to enter, but some how I still get stuck.\n\nNow for the things I like about the game.\n\n1. The Enviroment - It actually feels like a proper zombie apocalypse. Nothing is clean, nothing is overly destroyed. Things feel just right.\n\n2. Zombies are true to nature - Short of shooting them in the head, blowing them up with a grenade, or hitting them with a melee weapon. A zombie will keep coming after you. Thank you devs, these are true Zombies!\n\n3. Sound effects  - The sound effects in this game are really good in my opinion. Since there is no real map to use, you can listen for the gun shots of your fellow survivors to actually tell you a general idea of what direction they're at. Or as a Zombie you can use it to find where your targets are at (short of using the vision sight for foot prints.) Overall everything sounds good in this game.\n\n4. Limited resources - Nothing worse than playing a survival game and finding every little thing you need in the world in no time. Ammo, weapons, and medical kits are so hard to find. You actually have to concern yourself on how you approach the streets, corners, buildings, and rooms.\n\n5. Infection - There is a chance when you get hit by a zombie that you actually get infected. If you're infected, there is a limit of time before you start to feel it and eventually turn against your fellow survivors. You won't know you're infected till it's too late. Some people may find this annoying, but I love it. Even if you die as a survivor, the game isn't over for you. Because now you can fight against them as a zombie and lead Hordes of zombies towards them. (Nice way of getting payback on those Ammo hoaders)\n\n6. Board up and hold out - Now I know everyone likes base building, but honestly it get's old seeing player made sky forts or whatever. Contagion may not have base building, but boarding up windows is one of the most logical ways of keeping the zombies out. I just wish the boards didn't fall inbetween line of sights. If a Zombie gets close enough to try and break into the building, it's hard to get them off the window boards without shooting the defense itself.\n\n7. Plenty of maps and game modes - The game isn't limited to just your typical "Start at A and get to C by moving through B" (Though ti does have a escape mode which is fun still), but you also have a PVP game mode where players start off killing each other, then holding out against zombie palyers in a game of Hide and seek. A objective based game where players locate survivors and take them to be extracted across zombie infested streets or neighborhoods. Also with players seemingly able to make their own playable maps, it's no real concern about there ever really being a feeling of a lack of enviroments to play in.\n\n8. Maps change - Nothing better than playing a map that can change from another playthrough. I've had games where doors that were usually unlocked, were actually blocked off. So really you cannot predict what route you must take to get to a objective, you sort of have to learn on the fly.\n\n9. Random starting gear - Our survivors may be all different, but the nice thing is that they start out with random gear. You may have just a pistol at first one game, then the next you may have a pistol and a SMG. I just feel this is a nice way to keep things feeling interesting.\n\nOverall Contagion isn't a bad game, but it doesn't do too many things great. With some stuff fixed, a few improvements made, and some other little things. The game can honestly stand toe to toe with the Left 4 Dead games. Don't take this as me saying "i want it to be more like Left 4 Dead." I just want to see some more stuff that will pull me into the game more. One more zombie type, fixed weapon iron sights (or at least a visual zoom in), and some other little things would just be perfect for someone like me. While I cannot stand playing the game for hours on end. I can at least say what time I do play, I enjoy greatly.\n\nIf you see this game on sale and you want a good little Zombie shooter game, I would highly suggest picking this game up. I only paid five bucks and don't regret it.","September 1, 2014","true","19.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

This isn't a Left 4 Dead twitch FPS, no. Your shots have to be in the head and, considering ammo scarcity, they have to count. The guns sound punchy, feel great and do appropriate damage to the models. The dead shamble just like you'd expect and are incredibly adept at navigating the level. And, speaking of levels, the maps in Contagion are some of the best, most realistic feeling I've ever experienced in a shooter.

I like how they decided to make ammunition scarce, making the experience almost like real life. You are not likely to find a gun and a ton of ammo next to it behind a desk in real life. Well unless you're in a gun shop but i digress..\nThe stamina meter system forces players to pace themselves in order to survive as you would in a zombie apocalypse scenario.\nLastly, this game was meant to be played in Co-op. Playing it alone to practice is utterly boring, it would be better to play it with friends and gradually learn how to survive rather than do it on your own.\n\nFor an early access game it is really really good. I enjoyed playing, surviving, dying and shooting in the game and i'd play it again as soon as my friends are free to do so as well.\n\nSolid 8/10 material. Would be 10/10 probably when the game is fully developed.

I creep quietly along a white picket fence and take cover behind a white car. I can see someone up on the road walking really slowly.. Ok it looks like another player maybe? I turn off my light slowly creep up behind him, the closer I get the more odd the players behavior becomes. I get right up behind him and then he turns... well ... that's not a player at all, before me lies the bloodied face and nattering jaws of really nasty looking undead monster.\n\nJournal Entry 3\n\nI whip on my light and take a steady aim down the barrel.... The creature gives out a shriek and starts running at me, I take very careful calm aim and fire. A perfect headshot, I can see the exit wound clearly pop open from the back of his head like a straw going through the pre-cut slits in a slurpee lid. He instantly goes silent and falls to the ground with a thud, now I hear more noises and more shrieks from all around me. It appears we woke up the rest of his friends....\n\nJournal Entry 4\n\nThe undead are now locked in on my position and waves of them from dirty back alleys and busted up backyard fences moan and scream as they come towards me. I begin picking off the closest targets that I can get, headshoting to the best of my ability. I kill probably a dozen but they keep coming, wave after wave. I'm running low on ammo now, I've only got 5 rounds left and there are about 10 zombies close enough to deserve the bullets. I've stupidly backed myself into a fenced yard with no escape route. The only way out is in the direction that the zombies are coming in... crap this is bad... well its been a good run... I take very careful aim and shoot the next 5 zombies with perfect headshots, behind them comes a hoard of about 7 more. I don't think I will be able to charge through them, I accept my defeat and wait for them to get me....\n\nJournal Entry 5\n\nAll the sudden I hear gunfire... wtf.... I see flashlights bouncing off the cracks in the fence and footsteps running. I hear machine gun fire and pistols going off everywhere. A group of 3 other players rush in and save the day, a feeling of relief and awesomeness washes over me as they pick off the 7 zombies that were about to make dinner out of me. I join up with the group and follow them onward into the street.\n\nJournal Entry 6\n\nThe hoards are getting worse and worse as we progress up the blocks of this pleasant valley neighborhood, Another player states that we need to go hold up somewhere until the waves calm down a bit. We find a reasonably well boarded up house and decide to take it over, we move in clearing room by room. I now have ammo again and am able to help out with the room clearing. Suddenly the waves of zombies decide to start charging the house, the doors are shut and the windows boarded.... it is here that we make our stand, we load up our guns and take our positions.... the screams of zombies makes it sound like thousands of them are outside... we begin to hear the doors getting kicked and smashed.... they are coming through... lets do this!\n\n9/10\n\n","July 17, 2014","true","2.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Created by the developers of Zombie Panic: Source, aswell as being inspired by it, the game really stands out apon high quality graphics, gore level L4D2, and it's confusing, long lasting objective campeigns.\n\nZombie Panic: Source\nZP:S was my favorite mod for some time. I loved the ambient environment the developers gave to the maps. I enjoyed the concept of NEVER waiting after death, and you get to return as a zombie to infect the unsuspecting, almost helpless humans. The objectives it gave to the map were not confusing like in Contagion.\n\nObjective based gameplay\nThe "Escape" gamemode is rather confusing and really long, I do like long objective based campeigns, but I find it repetitive when the campeigns get you lost all the time. The maps are randomised, so they are incredibly confusing. I, aswell as many other people have been lost countless times looking for a button to open a door.\n\nGore, & Graphics\nThe gore and graphics are astounding. It's what peaks my eye, it looks fascinating for the Source Engine. This and, 'No More Room in Hell' (another Source mod) are the top 2 for graphically awesome Source games/mods I've ever seen. (This one is number 1).\n\nContagion still seems incomplete in only some areas, which may be fixed by frequent game updates. If there's anything I can recommend for the game, I recommend adding some maps from Zombie Panic: Source, remastering and implementing them in the game, I think that would be an awesome expirience for the people that have played the mod in the past.\n\n98.6/100","June 24, 2014","true","20.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Basicly it's a L4D2 game but with less ammo, less zombies, more survival and there is "game modes" in which there is objectives or just plain survive versus other humans. If you die , you become a zombie to try to stop them. Good multiplayer idea and decent game so far in beta stage. Hope this game can become better, because right now it's kinda simple and dull. It should have however great potential if you can invite your friends over, and you protect a house or fort or something, while a "horde" or wave of zombies try to kill you.\n\nPs.

So far im loving this game! definitly worth the 10 bucks i spent.\nA lot of reviews seem to say bad visuals, bad maps, no point to it... i highly disagree.\nFor a short summary, Hunter Mode is so much fun. its a couple humans scrounging for weapons and ammo, while having the ability to barricade windows and doors a bit from zombies. Its PvP during the hunt for ammo and guns and also to avoid the odd zombie or horde of zombies that come your way if you stay still. You can only kill a zombie with a headshot or a melee weapon to the head and shooting will also give away your position, as does your flashlight! Oh and you carry around an Android Smartphone and you need to pop it up often to see when enimies are nearby (also vibrates when close) and what your objectives are.\n\nI have seen one glitch so far in Extraction mode where the AI human got glitched in a bush and we couldnt complete the match.\n\nBut overall from 4 hours of continual play, i highly enjoy this game and its a blast if you have a couple of buddies or not to play with!\n\n8/10\n\nPros:\nGood Visuals (id compare to L4D2 for visuals)\nteamwork\nexploration\nintense\n\nCons:\nThe odd glitch.\nnot a lot of maps (enough to be satisfied with)\nsome servers are laggy (as are all games)","June 24, 2014","true","56.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","10"

It has multiple modes to play which include Escape, Extraction, Panic, Hunted, etc. In each mode you generally start off as a survivor, though sometimes you do start as a zombie. Your mission: to survive as long as possible. Once you die you get to control a zombie and attack the other survivors. It can be a really fun experience, though at times it can be somewhat boring due in large part to how big the maps are. After playing all the modes I think I like Extraction the best since it has alot of AI zombies along with the player controlled ones. That and the survivors have to hold out at certain locations which makes finding them easy. Oh yeah, and zombies have special abilities unique to them. For $4.99(as of 9/1/14) it's definitely worth it! The developer has already said that ALL future DLC will be free of charge.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SrAwesome/recommended/238430/","SrAwesome","sjcbcolby","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SrAwesome/","205 products in account","Contagion is a zombie survival game with a number of game mode focused on online play. In the game you can either play as a zombie or as a person when playing pvp which is fun to play both sides. As the person you can do your basic FPS mechanics and as a zombie you are the normal zombie exept you have a small speed boost and you can call a horde to your side from any zombies near to you. Theres also an extraction game mode where you have to try to save civilians without letting anyone die. There are more game modes to suchas one that can act like a story guiding you through a map. I personally found myself playing a pvp all alone just for the fun of blasting zombies away without worry of someone else trying to kill me.\nWhen it comes to inventory, you have 4 weapon slots and you can carry so much ammo it's not a worry, but that leads me into the next thing, getting ammo and supplies.\nYou start off every match witha random melee wapon and a pistol of some sort. From there, you must scavenge. You must break into peoples houses, movie theaters, malls, really anywhere and search high and low for things (don't worry about how the locals feel about this, they've already been infected). You can find anything from med kits to nail guns to wooden planks to assault rifles to varrying types of ammo to an occasional greanade (just try not to blow yourself up). This is a game where your shots count though and you shouldn't fire until you know it's going to be a head shot. A zombie can take a very large sum of bullets to the body or a single shot to the head.\nContagion did do a nive job with the models and what they look like when they take damage for the bodies. When you put a round in an undead's head, you can see a large exit would on the other side. If you blast their leg with a shot gun, it may come right off. If you hammer away at their chest, you may leave a nice cavity there. The point is, you can blast an enemy to smitherines and you'll be able to tell.\nIn the game you can also make a 'home base' type area such as when you're in the suburban map. The game provides nail guns and planks of wood if you look around to help secure an area. You can make this place a stock pile, a temporary place to just sit for a minute, or simply slow the zombies down for a few seconds while you run for your life out the back door.\nContagion also has large maps, especially the city one which I think is something like 9 full sized blocks (also if you look enough, this is the one game to put a gun store in it if you need a couple extra rounds. *wink wink, nudge nudge*) This is great when needing to run from another player or when you just feel like exploring.\nThe graphics in the game are good... but only at night. I've noticed that durring the daytime nothing looks as good as it could be, and though that may just be a time/budget thing to make it look good, just try not to look too closely at textures in the sunlight. When it comes to night time it does look very pleasing to the eye with their lighting engine and the reflections in everything. You can see this which helps to show off what it can do and with the lack of sunlight makes it so you don't focus on any below-par textures.\nLastly for what I have to say about the looks of the enviroment is rain. Just rain. It looks very nice compared to many other games I have played especially with the lighting engine to help show it off. You can see small ripples if you look close enough to where a rain drop has landed and little things like that.\nFinally, I would just like to point out the sound. They did a great job with the sound like when you step on a piece of fallen fence you can hear it shake, of when you step on broken glass and hear it crack. My point is, it sounds nice.\n\nThe good-\n-Great lighting engine (if anything it's a tad too bright with the flashlight, but that's fairly small depending on where you are\n-Zombies look great when heavily damaged\n-Nice sound\n-big maps\n-good, serious atmosphere\n-if you look close enough, most of the little extra stuff like books do actually have titles and such.\n\nThe bad-\n-player zombies feel a bit underpowered (but thats probably to help balence)\n-map size can make multiplayer difficult\n-revolves anound the same mechanics most of the time, it's more just who you're shooting at.\n\nThe ugly-\n-It may just be me but I've noticed a case of "fuzzy screen" when playing this that usually doesn't happen with other games\n-don't look at textures to close in the day time\n\nRating: 7.5-8/10\nIf you catch it for under $5 on a steam sale I definatelty reccomend, it's a fun game but some will like it more than others.","February 17, 2015","true","12.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The major reason? It perfectly captures the atmosphere of a Zombie Survival.\n\nWhat I mean is, until you finally succumb to your wounds and the infection takes over, you will try your damndest to survive and help your other survivors, excepting the Hunt PvP game mode. When the infection takes over however, it becomes immensely satisfying to hunt down your friends and bury them beneath a horde of undead. The game really ramps up as soon as a survivor dies, as now one zombie that looks like any other, has human intelligence and wants everyone dead like them.\n\nSo yeah, I like it, and fans of Schadenfreude should too.","January 5, 2015","true","15.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

At first I was pretty skeptical, considering I absolutely hated the Left 4 Dead series.  I'm just generally not a huge fan of the zombie genre (it's overdone imo).  But Contagion feels different.  You, as the player, are more involved.  We've really only played the Escape game mode, which for just the two of us is great.  And it seems a lot of the maps have randomly generated objectives when you play them.  Like some times a door may be blocked, but the next play through you can go through it and explore a different path to escape the map.  It makes replaying maps more enjoyable.\n\nWhen you die, you become a zombie.  It'd say it's more fun on a public server with multiple players, but in a 2-player co-op setting, it's not that fun.  But I can see the effects it would have on a 6+ player server.\n\nAll in all, it's a pretty decent game.","January 10, 2015","true","32.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SquarelyCircle/recommended/238430/","SquarelyCircle","SquarelyCircle","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SquarelyCircle/","1115 products in account","Terrible game.  I read one of the positive reviews and wonder what game they played.  This game is confusing and glitchy.  The cell phone, which gives you your missions, had text that was too large for its screen, so I ended up with only a quarter or less of the goal description, which was useless.\n\nI spawned (twice) in a building that had no way out.  I gave it the benefit of the doubt and searched for a key or something to open the outside doors, and after about an hour of searching, gave up and disconnected.  It wasn't even that big a building.  Even if there WAS a way out, a good game doesn't have you sitting around with nothing to do for an hour.\n\nButtons would sometimes not do what they were supposed to.  Once I ran out of ammo, and it wouldn't let me melee.  What is worse, when you do melee, it feels like your just slapping the zombie.  If I was gonna hit a zombie, I'd hit the zombie hard enough to knock it over or break something.  In the game, I hit a zombie over and over and over, and it never got knocked back, and it never died.  Finally a teammate found me and shot it.\n\nSomeone mentioned how much fun it was to not have much ammo.  Well, I got stuck without ammo on a ladder with zombies at the top, and I couldn't get them out of the way.  These zombies finally discovered the perfect strategy.  Just swallow the ammo and stand on the ladders, and there's no way they'll ever escape.\n\nIf this game has any hope of being a fun experience, they've got a lot of work to do.  It isn't exciting.  It isn't scary.  It isn't fun.  What were they hoping the game would be?  And why have a free weekend when the game is in such a terrible state?\n\nI'll follow this up by saying that the game may have some redeeming qualities that I didn't see.  I didn't play much, and won't be coming back, so I may have missed the best it has to offer.  But with so many excellent games out there... I don't see how they can balance out the hours of unexplained, empty, lonely exploration that concluded in exiting to desktop.","August 29, 2014","false","1.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

However, it is not for everyone because it can be difficult.  This is the kind of game people play when they want to show their skills or completely ruin someone's day.  When you die (or become infected), you become a zombie, which then turns your gaming experiencing into a hunt for flesh.  Sometimes people like myself join servers just to infect all other players.  With 5 game modes mixing up 9 different maps, this game actually provides a large amount of content.  The game lets you pick from 12 Characters, and lets you play with up to 8 players.\n\nPros:+The maps are always randomized for every playthrough\n+Lots of detailed models and nice lighting\n+The zombie gore is surprisingly good\n+No load Screens\n+There are always people playing.  Although, the population is still small\n\nCons: -Animation  Issues\n-Sometimes the zombies move really strange and get stuck in spots.\n-This can sometimes make aiming difficult and even frustrating.\n-It would've been nice to see other monsters to shoot than just zombies\n\n\nMy Advice for Noobs\nALWAYS AIM FOR THE HEAD!!!\nAll levels can be beaten solo, except for the Hunted game mode\nShare ammo:  if someone is using a fire extinguisher, give them ammo\nSometimes you can get infected from 1 hit\n\n\nOverall Score  82/100","March 24","true","156.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ThinkSammich/recommended/238430/","ThinkSammich","grant","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ThinkSammich/","118 products in account","If the idea of another Zombie title wasn't enough to turn you away, surely being 1 hit killed by a ninja zombie and losing 25 minutes of map progress will break your will. Contagion is a good example of why realism in fantasy setting gaming is not necessary. I tried to find something new offered by this title, but the truth is the idea was played out 2 years ago. While there are several game modes that differ from static zombie survival, I feel like they are held back by the element of "realism" this game tries to portray.\n\nModes like Panic just left me feeling frustrated, Survival mode is fancy wording for "camping", Extraction just spawns dozens of zombies on top of your group, and Escape pits downed teammates against you. Often spawning them relatively close to try and troll your 25 minutes of map progress. I suspect the game was built with "Escape" mode in mind, as it is the most heavily scripted mode, as well as making the most sense within the game. With a party of friends you could enjoy this mode for sure, but I'm not sure if it's actually worth your money, as the other game modes become repetive or annoying pretty quickly.\n\nWith all that said, the developers DID put time into the title. Maps are dynamic, meaning objectives and routes will not be the same every match. An alleyway that worked for your group before may be blocked the next time you visit that particular map. Weapons have a nice feeling to them, headshots even moreso. This game is pretty much as different from Left for Dead as a zombie title can be, you are encouraged to take your time and make safe decisions, which can feel especially rewarding for a coordinated group of friends. However, as with any online game, online experiences with strangers may vary. What that basically means is you will know if your group has the potential to finish a map within the first 5 minutes of gameplay. Those who aren't concerned with ammunition conservation will not survive, and in some situations will be the bane of the entire group. There will always be players who hoard weapons and play outside of the group, or those who dominate voice chat and bark commands at anyone not running the most efficient path from the beginning to the end of the map.\n\nAs a zombie the AI is relatively easy to manipulate, the "roar" feature allows you to build a horde, and the elementary AI pathing allows you to perfectly stack that hoard in a corner. Humans stand no chance against a patient zombie player, especially if you learn the maps. Lag is a big issue with the game, you are left to play peer 2 peer sessions while the minimal amount of dediacted servers remain full (at least for the east coast). Another issue I have encountered with the game is it does not feel rewarding in any sense to complete a map. I found the round restarting before I could even enjoy the statistics screen or catch my breath.\n\nI found it refreshing that there was nothing to grind towards in the game, also no micro-transaction shop being dangled in front of my face at every menu screen. There is no experience, or reward for being a veteran player. With some experience in the shooter genre you can jump in this game the first time and be mechanically equal with those who have played 100 hours.\n\nAs a party game or something to do with close friends, I suspect the experience would be supremely enjoyable. However, as a lone wolf who usually bets on strangers and coinflips, the experience was far from satisfactory. A large portion of the game is just another zombie backdrop with PvP going on, while the rest just falls short when it comes to innovative or even enjoyable gameplay. Replay value is short, but I wouldn't be too quick to judge, the game could be an enjoyable lan title after it drops in price.","August 30, 2014","false","4.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

Granted, this is partially due to my machine, but I found the gameplay very rough when the action was on. Graphics-wise, I was not super disappointed (because I paid nothing) but given what is out there I would expect more. Gameplay was only fun because I played with others. Oddly enough, I agreed with another player who said the running around searching for a way out and looking for ammo/tools was probably more like a 'real' zombie apocalypse than running and gunning everywhere.

It would have been nice to develop a basic survival or objective map which is easy to find the objectives with and not too hard to navigate without a map and decent common sense. ( the umbrella map from ZPS for example)\n\nAs for the hitboxes, it may be only me , but considering I have a pretty decent ping and FPS, I don't think I can blame my aim for not hitting the heads since I am a long yeared FPS - Gamer.\n\nThe zombies not having a "through the wall" vision like in L4D is not something neccessary, but it would help zombies find the survivors easier since zombies don't have it any easier to navigate the maps than the survivors.\nThe shooting sounds of the guns are unreliable to the distance and location and thus don't really help THAT much.\nIt would be nice to let the zombies have a 5 meter range through the wall vision or something similar.\n\nAlright, this is my review so far.\nI am ready to accept change and fixes, but for the moment, I have a rather negative experience with this game.\n\n\nGreetings\nSkipper ( a ZPS Hardcore player from the first hour )","December 24, 2013","false","19.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","1"

However, it is not for everyone because it can be difficult.  This is the kind of game people play when they want to show their skills or completely ruin someone's day.  When you die (or become infected), you become a zombie, which then turns your gaming experiencing into a hunt for flesh.  Sometimes people like myself join servers just to infect all other players.  With 5 game modes mixing up 9 different maps, this game actually provides a large amount of content.  The game lets you pick from 12 Characters, and lets you play with up to 8 players.\n\nPros:+The maps are always randomized for every playthrough\n+Lots of detailed models and nice lighting\n+The zombie gore is surprisingly good\n+No load Screens\n+There are always people playing.  Although, the population is still small\n\nCons: -Animation  Issues\n-Sometimes the zombies move really strange and get stuck in spots.\n-This can sometimes make aiming difficult and even frustrating.\n-It would've been nice to see other monsters to shoot than just zombies\n\n\nMy Advice for Noobs\nALWAYS AIM FOR THE HEAD!!!\nAll levels can be beaten solo, except for the Hunted game mode\nShare ammo:  if someone is using a fire extinguisher, give them ammo\nSometimes you can get infected from 1 hit\n\n\nOverall Score  82/100","March 24","true","156.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SrAwesome/recommended/238430/","SrAwesome","sjcbcolby","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SrAwesome/","205 products in account","Contagion is a zombie survival game with a number of game mode focused on online play. In the game you can either play as a zombie or as a person when playing pvp which is fun to play both sides. As the person you can do your basic FPS mechanics and as a zombie you are the normal zombie exept you have a small speed boost and you can call a horde to your side from any zombies near to you. Theres also an extraction game mode where you have to try to save civilians without letting anyone die. There are more game modes to suchas one that can act like a story guiding you through a map. I personally found myself playing a pvp all alone just for the fun of blasting zombies away without worry of someone else trying to kill me.\nWhen it comes to inventory, you have 4 weapon slots and you can carry so much ammo it's not a worry, but that leads me into the next thing, getting ammo and supplies.\nYou start off every match witha random melee wapon and a pistol of some sort. From there, you must scavenge. You must break into peoples houses, movie theaters, malls, really anywhere and search high and low for things (don't worry about how the locals feel about this, they've already been infected). You can find anything from med kits to nail guns to wooden planks to assault rifles to varrying types of ammo to an occasional greanade (just try not to blow yourself up). This is a game where your shots count though and you shouldn't fire until you know it's going to be a head shot. A zombie can take a very large sum of bullets to the body or a single shot to the head.\nContagion did do a nive job with the models and what they look like when they take damage for the bodies. When you put a round in an undead's head, you can see a large exit would on the other side. If you blast their leg with a shot gun, it may come right off. If you hammer away at their chest, you may leave a nice cavity there. The point is, you can blast an enemy to smitherines and you'll be able to tell.\nIn the game you can also make a 'home base' type area such as when you're in the suburban map. The game provides nail guns and planks of wood if you look around to help secure an area. You can make this place a stock pile, a temporary place to just sit for a minute, or simply slow the zombies down for a few seconds while you run for your life out the back door.\nContagion also has large maps, especially the city one which I think is something like 9 full sized blocks (also if you look enough, this is the one game to put a gun store in it if you need a couple extra rounds. *wink wink, nudge nudge*) This is great when needing to run from another player or when you just feel like exploring.\nThe graphics in the game are good... but only at night. I've noticed that durring the daytime nothing looks as good as it could be, and though that may just be a time/budget thing to make it look good, just try not to look too closely at textures in the sunlight. When it comes to night time it does look very pleasing to the eye with their lighting engine and the reflections in everything. You can see this which helps to show off what it can do and with the lack of sunlight makes it so you don't focus on any below-par textures.\nLastly for what I have to say about the looks of the enviroment is rain. Just rain. It looks very nice compared to many other games I have played especially with the lighting engine to help show it off. You can see small ripples if you look close enough to where a rain drop has landed and little things like that.\nFinally, I would just like to point out the sound. They did a great job with the sound like when you step on a piece of fallen fence you can hear it shake, of when you step on broken glass and hear it crack. My point is, it sounds nice.\n\nThe good-\n-Great lighting engine (if anything it's a tad too bright with the flashlight, but that's fairly small depending on where you are\n-Zombies look great when heavily damaged\n-Nice sound\n-big maps\n-good, serious atmosphere\n-if you look close enough, most of the little extra stuff like books do actually have titles and such.\n\nThe bad-\n-player zombies feel a bit underpowered (but thats probably to help balence)\n-map size can make multiplayer difficult\n-revolves anound the same mechanics most of the time, it's more just who you're shooting at.\n\nThe ugly-\n-It may just be me but I've noticed a case of "fuzzy screen" when playing this that usually doesn't happen with other games\n-don't look at textures to close in the day time\n\nRating: 7.5-8/10\nIf you catch it for under $5 on a steam sale I definatelty reccomend, it's a fun game but some will like it more than others.","February 17, 2015","true","12.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I have a rather poor computer but it ran pretty well after some work. However, early beta is 100% correct. Very fun with friends, actually with friends is recommended. Sadly, I have a VERY hard time by myself. A shame, seeing how easy it was to play singleplayer. While playing, things would not spawn, mainly the keys in the beginning of the Escape level. I would be running between the two security rooms for almost an hour not finding any keys. Seeing how everything is in different places with every game, it felt like the spawns went a little crazy, felt like the whole mission was broken. With Extraction, the game is rather impossible to complete. (for a new player to the game like me) This game seemed like I HAD to play with other people in order for the game to WORK.\n\nThat being said, the graphics are very impressive and the zombie hit boxes are surprisenly well done. The random spawns are always fun  when first playing, but again, they need to WORK so people may proceed with the mission.  Instead of randomly generating EVERYTHING, maybe keep key items in the same room but in a different area. Seriously, I have to restart an escape mission 3 different times just so I could find the damn KEYS! I'm sure I am just not searching hard enough but I think looking for about an hour enough to say that the items are a little broken when being placed.\n\nVery good game, fustratingly hard, broken feel, but stil worth it. Hope you guys fix the bugs for singleplayer so people who like playing alone be able to play instead of punishing them by making them play with others. But again, in Beta so I am hoping they can fix the mistakes and I really like the game.","December 24, 2013","true","19.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The maps seem reasonable and interesting, each one actually seems different from the others for sure, whether it be mission wise or landscaping. Weapons also seem just right for about everything when it comes to how its useful and the damage it gives off.\n\nHowever, while playing this i have noticed, and yes you may quote me on this, it seems to be partially infested with players having huge ego. By this, i mean that when i enter a server, reguardless of game mode, some people tend to team kill or purposely find a way to get another person killed just to ruin progress. This is my only issue it seems, besides the first escape mission, where the mission progression seems to take forever at times just to get to the next task.\n\nWith this all being said, its a good game. Great even, if you can get passed the idiots looking for attention. My suggestion is to play this game with no friendly fire, and/or player zombies.

It feels like every other free to play zombie game out right now, but at substantially less of a quality. The peak amount of players being around thirty to fourty people should tell you enough. I can see this game being a good mod or f2p, but not a good pay to play game. If you want a better zombie game, check out No more room in hell, or zombie panic source.","August 29, 2014","false","21.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

I was trying to not let the fact the dev's are jerks get into my recommendation\n\nEDIT (Like a year later): I had another run-in with one of the dev's who blatantly said that I blew at the game, which is fine, I could care less, I rarely play it, just still irks me that the devs try to be so "transparent" but laugh at player's and use non-professional language.","January 1, 2014","true","11.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The maps seem reasonable and interesting, each one actually seems different from the others for sure, whether it be mission wise or landscaping. Weapons also seem just right for about everything when it comes to how its useful and the damage it gives off.\n\nHowever, while playing this i have noticed, and yes you may quote me on this, it seems to be partially infested with players having huge ego. By this, i mean that when i enter a server, reguardless of game mode, some people tend to team kill or purposely find a way to get another person killed just to ruin progress. This is my only issue it seems, besides the first escape mission, where the mission progression seems to take forever at times just to get to the next task.\n\nWith this all being said, its a good game. Great even, if you can get passed the idiots looking for attention. My suggestion is to play this game with no friendly fire, and/or player zombies. (Player zombies do get quite out of hand at times i must add.)","January 21, 2015","true","14.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I have a rather poor computer but it ran pretty well after some work. However, early beta is 100% correct. Very fun with friends, actually with friends is recommended. Sadly, I have a VERY hard time by myself. A shame, seeing how easy it was to play singleplayer. While playing, things would not spawn, mainly the keys in the beginning of the Escape level. I would be running between the two security rooms for almost an hour not finding any keys. Seeing how everything is in different places with every game, it felt like the spawns went a little crazy, felt like the whole mission was broken. With Extraction, the game is rather impossible to complete. (for a new player to the game like me) This game seemed like I HAD to play with other people in order for the game to WORK.\n\nThat being said, the graphics are very impressive and the zombie hit boxes are surprisenly well done. The random spawns are always fun  when first playing, but again, they need to WORK so people may proceed with the mission.  Instead of randomly generating EVERYTHING, maybe keep key items in the same room but in a different area. Seriously, I have to restart an escape mission 3 different times just so I could find the damn KEYS! I'm sure I am just not searching hard enough but I think looking for about an hour enough to say that the items are a little broken when being placed.\n\nVery good game, fustratingly hard, broken feel, but stil worth it. Hope you guys fix the bugs for singleplayer so people who like playing alone be able to play instead of punishing them by making them play with others. But again, in Beta so I am hoping they can fix the mistakes and I really like the game.","December 24, 2013","true","19.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"
