You can't just fire all the time and expect to have ammunition (especially torpedoes) left by the end of a match.\n+ Battleships are actually powerful with their main guns, and can lob rounds well out of their own view range (which is what scouts like destroyers are useful for!).\n+ Aircraft carriers can pick and choose their own plane loadout, allowing for customization to your own playstyle.\n\n- Because of battleships being really powerful, they're currently (as of this writing) somewhat over-used. Matches can often have more battleships than other ship types.\n- Cruisers as a whole tend to be VERY sparsely populated (because of the glut of battleships, which easily shred cruisers).\n- Physics is arcadey at times. Ships can accelerate or stop much faster than would be possible for a ship of their size (battleships getting up to speed within a few seconds, for example).\n\nGameplay is somewhat of a mix between Battlestations: Pacific and World of Warships.\n\nOverall I would recommend this game to anyone who wants a good naval-themed game.","December 6, 2015","true","206.6"," 338 of 369 people (92%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","92","338","369","11","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fasermaler/recommended/390670/","fasermaler","MV-22B Osprey","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fasermaler/","100 products in account","Instead of playing like a WoWS clone, it plays out more like a battlestations clone.\n\n-The ability to gain control of your secondary and AA armament is highly appreciated, instead of waiting for RNG to do it's work and shoot down incoming bombers, manual AA armament control puts the power back in the hands of the player.\n\n-Carrier gameplay is much much more interesting. I have both T9 CVs in WoWS and over the time from the CBT till now, WG's balance changes to CVs have shown their lack of vision for how they want CVs to play out. Instead of fixed loadouts, Steel Ocean goes close to the NavyField style of allowing you to customize your squadrons in combat to fit the dynamics of the situation. Additionally, the existence of dedicated scouting aircraft really pushes the versatility of carriers even further - beyond mere torpedo dispensers. Additionally, a division allows up to 2 carriers, which means that if you a friend both love carriers and want to play them, none of you will have to compromise and play a less desirable class of ship unlike in the case of WoWS.\n\n-Aiming while moving is a lot more inaccurate in Steel Ocean, somewhat a approximation of real life. While encouraging people to stop to aim in a fast-paced arcady game is indeed a dubious design decision, it can't be dismissed that aiming requires more skill than WoWS and at the back of the minds of ship captains remains the cost vs risk analysis of stopping for better aim but becoming a better target.\n\n-No torpedo lead indicator. Once again, another aspect from battlestations - the lack of torpedo lead indicator means that torpedoes are more for area denial and close range torpedo attacks are needed to ensure a successful torpedo attack. Additionally, the torpedo arming distance is feels much further than WoWS, which prevents DD suicide charges.\n\n-Submarines. Submarine gameplay is sufficiently balanced and fun in steel ocean. There is a huge step away from historical realism, but considering how WoWS threw historical realism out of the window since 0.3.7 in the CBT, the argument that submarines in WoWS will "not be historically realistic" does not hold water. Instead, in Steel Ocean, submarines have 3 depth heights, surface, periscope and deep - the deeper the dive, the faster the oxygen supplies used, but the harder for the submarine to be attacked. Oxygen supplies run out comically fast - as expected of an arcade game, but nothing feels out of place or imbalanced.\n\n-Better ship customizbility. Multiple camo options as well as national flags, using a buy/rent system allows a greater degree of personalization in this game.\n\n-Comprehensive tutorial system. Not only does a dedicated tutorial for the basics exists, tutorials for carrier and submarines are available when these ships are unlocked as well. Additionally, a one time of assistance is accorded to the player in the game. I personally made the mistake of jumping straight into a match my Bogue when I first got the ship, but the pointers and tooltips within the game allowed me to pick up the basics on the fly. Afterwhich, I played the dedicated carrier tutorial to get a more comprehensive overview.\n\n-Extra bonus for carrier fans: Yorktown, Wasp and Shinano are in the game. These ships are in the skill tree, unlike how they are often postulated to be premium ships in the case of WoWS\n\nSo what's the catch?\n\n-The graphics are bad and poorly optimized - even Battlestations Pacific looks better in some regards. Additionally, the RAM usage can get ridiculously high. People I know have managed to get a solid 50 fps in WoWS but struggle to get 20 fps in Steel Ocean despite the difference in graphics.\n\n- The global chat is cancerous. I often see Chinese and Japanese players argue in the chat\n(sometimes, hilariously, in their own respective languages). Constructive comments and requests for help are often ignored and buried under a pile of memes and arguments.\n\n- Your Mileage May Vary, but this game is highly arcady and might be a turn off to certain players. That being said, I do not think that this alone warrants it a bad review. It is a merely a design decision. Battlestations and NavyField were sufficiently unrealistic as well, yet they were highly enjoyable games. To take an analogy from the gameplay aspect of air combat series of games, WoWS would be Ace Combat, Battlestations and Steel Ocean would be Crimson Skies and Silent Hunter would be  IL-2 Sturmovik. Undeniably, all of these analogous games are enjoyable in their own way but they definitely lie on different parts of the realism scale.\n\nThis game shows strong potential and has the systems and structure in place to create a highly diverse and interesting experience, however, poor graphics and optimization hampers the game and the arcady experience isn't for everyone. It might be wise to not approach this game as a "WoWS clone" but approach it as "another naval battle game" and evaluate it as such. In the latter case, it certainly has it's own flavor as a BS/NF hybrid with WoWS-esque gameplay.","November 14, 2015","true","12.0"," 175 of 201 people (87%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","87","175","201","3","4"

If anything it would be more like Navy Field. It's more Arcade then WoWS (played about 1550 Matches in it, got a Tier X CV and BB). And for me, it does various things better.  I would say it rewards your personal Skills much more then wows because the game doesn't take you by the Hand. Let me elaborate:\n\n- Torps are fired one by one and manually. This gives you much more Freedom about timing and placing, but can also be harder because you don't have an aim assist like in wows\n- The BBs and CAs got an Artillery View for their Main Batteries which is pretty much like in WoT or AW, So you will have to Focus for a few secs instead of hit and run\n- The whole Spotting mechanic is a lot different and rewards XP / Points for the Spotters. It also makes the Game much more Rock / Paper / Scissors.\n- CVs are pretty well implemented right now. They did several things i critizied in WoWS over Months. A maximum Number of Planes that can be started at a time, a max of 3 squads a time, limited fuel and far less Spotting range. But also, you can chose manually what kind of Layout you want ( you can configurate the number of plane types you want aboard  in the Maintenance Screen)  Also, onward to my next point, your Planes will die more often because..\n- You will have to aim your AA manually, and i love that Fact. If your Aim is good it allows you to annihalate Torp Sqads even before they can drop. Pretty much what i said at the start, it rewards personal Skill.\n\nThe only real Downside right now is that there are still not enough players, but hopefully my Review might change that :P If you liked Navy Field or WoWS you should at least give it a Try. It wont be your Harm. Right now, after 500+ games in it, i can't really see any Reason to go back to WoWS.","December 27, 2015","true","216.0"," 137 of 154 people (89%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","89","137","154","7","0"

Taking influences from all of them and turning them into an interesting and entertaining F2P title.\n\nAfter playing a few hours I personally start to prefer it over WoWS; it features a more demanding gunnery with maneuvering and aim-time having more influence on spread of a volley than in WoWs, also you get manual control over your secondaries and heavy AAA which I personaly prefer. While the ranges are 'shorter' when you go by the range displayed, they feel a lot longer than in WoWs right from the start thanks to the different scale of the ships themselves and the battlefield.\nAlso, Torpedos in this game actually have arming distances.\nThe game also expands the battlefield with another class of vessels, submarines are playable and introduce a new threat to BBs and lone carriers while expanding the duty of DDs and CLs to submarine warfare.\n\nIt's of course not without flaws, It is certainly a bit uglier than WoWs though it easily beats NF, but that's not really a challenge (not talking about NF2, nobody talks about NF2). There are only NA servers available, so I have to play with a rather high ping of 120 to 200 from central europe. And the UI is not the cleanest design around.\n\nThat said, it's free. So if you're interested in a (F2P) naval arcade combat game, just download it and sink a few ships to see if it fits you and judge yourself if you like it more than its competitors or not.","November 14, 2015","true","59.0"," 172 of 209 people (82%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","82","172","209","8","8"

You cannot hold a conversation of any length without it triggering at some point. Complaining about someone suiciding on your team? Can't. Suicide is a bad word. Want to complain about passive-aggressive behavior? Good luck: Passive is a bad word... because it contains '♥♥♥'. Absurdity reaches a pitched fever when you try to describe a map in a naval warfare game and it pukes on you for using the word 'canal'. Not that this is any of a surprise... China is good at exactly two things: Censoring the **** out of everything and producing lead-infused childrens' toys.\n\nWhich leads me to the game itself: The gameplay itself is about as fun as lead poisoning. The map selection is small. Submarines and carriers are severely underpowered, and battleships can be easily sunk by one or two torpedoes... as long as you spend money to get the gold-plated versions. Regular versions require about 4 torpedoes to sink one. And destroyers and cruisers can launch 4-8 of these, so you're still pretty screwed even without the Credit Card Ultimate Upgrade(tm).\n\nThe carriers are cursed with planes that are easily shot down, can be seen at over three times the distance they can spot at, and as a courtesy, fly low, slow, and in straight lines or hopelessly long and predictable semi-circles. And the torpedo-dropping ones even helpfully do a full circle about the release point before dropping most of the time. Basically, you have to be asleep at the keyboard to be damaged by a plane, and this assumes you didn't faceplant onto the "W" key and aren't completely stationary. Even at that, you can expect to only have your planes hit the target about half the time.  Unless you spend money, in which case all of these problems go away and you're gifted with planes that fly fast, have 21st century stealth technology, and shoot lasers. Okay, I'm lying about the lasers... but the damage they put out makes you wish it did... a single gold-plated torpedo could probably take out a small island.\n\nI could go on, but I think you get the point: It suffers from terrible balance issues, and feels like a cheap knock-off of world of tanks, but with ships. Which, well, you know... China. Even assuming you like the game, you're going to be in a league of your own: There's only about 300 or so people on the server in the evenings, so if you advance far enough in the game to have decent ships, you'll be staring at a loading screen forever. And, if you don't advance far enough, you'll die to some guy with money to burn who will sink you with his credit card, because at the lower tiers, skill is pretty irrelevant. But, if you do decide to play the game, do yourself a favor: Don't ever type anything in the game. Because sooner or later, the filter will trip, and if you spend any time at all chatting, you'll probably get a moderator (or a script; I'm not sure how it happens, I just see a lot of complaints outside of the game) to mute you. Maybe they're just practicing for their future job getting paid ten cents and a cracker to build the great firewall of China, I don't know.\n\nIf you appreciate this sarcastic and brutally honest review, give me a thumbs up. If you didn't appreciate it, you're probably on the phone to steam support and I have no idea what you're saying because there's no subtitles... but I can guess it's something to the effect of mumble mumble help help I'm being oppressed mumble.  So thanks, China. You've made me proud to be an American... where at least our sh*tty games don't suffer from a pathological need to oppress its own players.

No, it's better.  Here's why:\n\n+ Gunnery requires skill.  The longer you aim, the more accurate the guns will become.  Turning the vessel even a little bit will spoil your aim, as it should be.\n\n+ Torpedoes also require skill to use; there's no overlay telling you exactly when and where to shoot torps.  If you want to slam an entire volley of fish from your DD into a battleship, you'll need to get close to it.  A BB's secondaries can rake you hard if you do.  Which brings up...\n\n+ Direct control of secondaries!  See Wargaming?  That wasn't so hard, was it?  Direct control of AA guns, as well.\n\n+ Big tech trees for three nations.  Two more placeholders.  Far more ships here than in WoWS.\n\n+ Submarines!  See Wargaming?  That wasn't so hard, was it?  And depth charges, too.  A couple of DDs taking it to a submerged u-boat is great fun.  This gives the DDs a really imporant role in fleet engagements, as a sub getting in close to your battleline or carriers can wreak havoc in very short order.\n\n+ Battleships don't suck.  They actually have useful armor.  DDs and CLs can't just hang back and flamethrower a BB to death.  Small caliber artillery will bounce off of a BB's armor belt, though you can penetrate their thinly-armored decks if you can finagle a hit on them.  Your best bet is to close to torp range in a group.   Make no mistake:  a single DD is quite capable of ruining a BB's day if she gets in under the guns.\n\n+ Battleship main batteries hit HARD.  If you land a solid volley on a non-capital vessel, it's toast.\n\n+ More advanced crew management.  There are a lot of different crewmen with a huge variety of activated skills, and they acquire more skills with experience.  It's almost RPG-ish in nature.\n\n+ Detailed equipment and consumables in a large variety.\n\n+ World of Tanks style vessel progression.  You upgrade individual parts of the ship as you wish.\n\n+ There's a very unique "investment" system, whereby you can invest gold in your future progression, which will pay off with interest as you unlock higher tiers.\n\n+ A renown system which you can play to increase your rank.  Rewards are given out at the end of each "season" based upon the rank you achieve.  Better play increases your rank, and vice versa.\n\n+ Buy gold direct through the Steam wallet.  This puts a layer of security between you and the foreign game company.\n\n\nIn short, everything that's wrong with WoWS has been fixed here.  Downside?  Not much:\n\n- Graphics aren't quite as pretty as WoWS, but still quite acceptable, especially if you crank it up to ultra.  I'm playing on a four year old box and it handles ultra no problem.\n\n- Wonky support for triple monitor (FOV is too close).  This, however, is a very minor issue, as I realize I'm in the extreme minority of users of Surround/Eyefinity.\n\n- Some minor translation issues, but they're more subtle than gross.  Just convention and usage, nothing game breaking.  Most people probably won't even notice, or care if they do.  I certainly don't.\n\n\nThis is my naval game, now.  Adios, WoWS.  Nice knowin' ya, but I'm moving on.","November 14, 2015","true","82.5"," 282 of 390 people (72%) found this review helpful 38 people found this review funny","72","282","390","38","19"

But don't try to convince a people with different opinion to you, as it's impossible on the internet.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n后半部分包含中文\nTo the foreign players:   Don't try this game  .\n\nSome of the reviews said that, this game is a copy of world of warships.\nAccurately, it's really not a copy of world of warships.  It's a copy of world of tanks!!!\nThe gameplay of this game is very terrible, and doesn't feel like of driving a naval ship.\nFor example, the control of ship is very agile, make it possible, and ingame you will often, do a flank attack. This shouldn't, and couldn't be happened in the real naval battles.\nAnd, the weapon control is also strange. They directly copy the artillery control from WOT,  so you could imagine that, about 10 or more players, just stop their ship in the battle fields, to wait their weapon aiming.\nThe submarines is the unique part of this game. But, they seems have no idea about how to make a underwater scene, so the submarines are just pinned under the surface of water. And the submarines have a terrible balance issue, make it much harder to the players in other type of ships.\n\nThe worst thing of this game is, it have a  super pay2win mechanism . There's many commanders in the game, many of them have average abilities, but some of them are kinda too OP.\nAnd, how to get these commanders? Buy it? No!\nYou could only get the commanders, by a random draw system like Gacha (or capsule?) from japanese mobile card game. If you want to get the powerful commanders, you need to pay really really much.\n\nI'm not a fan of wargaming series, but for me, this game is even worse than world of warships, at least WOWS could make you feel like you are playing a naval game, not a commanders collection game with tanks drving on the water.\nAnd also, I recommend you guys not to play any of the chinese commercial games that already, or incoming to on the Steam. Some of the chinese independent games are pretty good, but the commercial games are 99% sh**. More than ten years of the complete enclosed videogame environment, make most of the chinese game developers forget how to making a game with good contents. At first they copy the korean online game, and now they copy the japanese and western games. Hope one day there could be a true game developers kind environment.\n\n=====================================================\n\n先说结论，我要给这游戏差评。\n当然，和Steam上烂大街的画质/优化节奏大师不一样，我们不提这游戏的画质（虽然它确实一般）。\nSteel Ocean，或者让我们提起它的本名，《海战世界》，这是搜狐畅游旗下的游戏。说实话，光是看到这个公司名我就已经瑟瑟发抖，不过具体的黑历史我们还是不提了。\n海战世界顾名思义，是一款海面载具射击游戏，也就是船。但是如果你说它是WG旗下《战舰世界》的抄袭游戏，那我可要反对了。它怎么会是抄袭《战舰世界》？\n人家抄的是《坦克世界》！\n\n海战世界在游戏体验上有致命缺陷，让你清楚的感觉到你玩的不是一艘船。\n首先，船体的操控灵活度就有问题，你能够很轻易的减速和倒退，惯性作用很小，因此你能够做出隔山伸缩流之类的玩法来，这是在海战中绝对不会发生的事情。\n其次，火控机制也是非常糟糕的部分。海战世界直接复制了坦克世界里自行火炮的瞄准机制，不仅鹰眼视角是如此，第三人称视角居然也是如此！想象一下十几艘战列舰停在战场中间互相等缩圈，真是壮观。\n畅游下了不少功夫在宣传潜艇上，然而他们恐怕不知道怎么做好水下场景，于是他们选择了——不做！潜艇像是直接贴在水面下几十米的地方。说实话猎杀潜航之类的游戏虽然水底场景做的不是很好，但是好歹能看，你这潜艇直接“浮”在海底不太好吧。不论画面，潜艇的平衡性也一直有很大问题，相比起它的输出能力，其他舰艇的反潜能力实在太弱，导致很多事情潜艇都非常OP。\n\n当然，要说《海战世界》我们还是不得不说它神奇的指挥官系统。这游戏有很多不同的指挥官，各自有不同的技能加成，其中有一些的技能可以说是史诗级别的强力。\n那么在哪里才能买到呢？商店里么？\n不！你根本不能“买”到指挥官，你需要抽！俗话说的好，充钱才能变强，但是现在你充钱也不一定能变强了，真是开心啊。可以说我还是第一次见到MMORPG以外的游戏用抽奖系统，而且还是这么直接，这么露骨的用手游式的扭蛋系统。\n\n不是给WG打广告，我是正统WG黑，然而这个游戏真心连战舰世界都不如，好歹战舰世界还有点船的样子。\n最早的时候我还是对这游戏有点盼头的，因为刚玩过千岛湖世界感觉比较失望，指望这游戏能够改变一些。然而我还是太天真了，游戏机制从开测到现在还是没什么改变，这样子只能是自己坑自己了。\n当然，Steam上还是有不少国产游戏的，很多独立游戏也能看出制作者花了不少心血。但是这堆商业游戏，尤其是准备上Steam的仙剑6，你问我滋不滋磁？我只能说，亦可赛艇！","November 12, 2015","false","1.6"," 716 of 1,044 people (69%) found this review helpful 107 people found this review funny","69","716","1","107","55"

Its as far away from World of Warships as you can get (And Tone isnt an effin premium like those money vampires in St. Petersburg...). So here's 10 reasons SO is better than WoWS.\n\n1) Most of the ships arent paper designs.\nWhile you have things like the Illinois-class, Kongo Prototype, Nagato Prototype, and the H-classes, they only represent a small amount of ships (I can probably count them on the 15 fingers on each hand of an Agent Orange baby), the significant majority of the ships there are realistic, and some have specific years to designate how old/outdated their technology is compared to their modernized versions (Like for instance, Furutaka (1921) won't have the same statistics as the Furutaka in World of Warships, which has multiple hulls depicting multiple years modernizations took place (Or in WoWS Paper ship terms, different designs)), and most ships are balanced by what they possessed in terms of firepower, speed, and overall difficulty to wield (For instance, Pensacola is Tier 5 whereas Cleveland is Tier 8 in SO, meanwhile in World of Warships, because Pensacosta is apparently a better upgrade, Cleveland is Tier 6 and Pensacola is Tier 7).\n\n2) Graphics\nIm gonna cut right to the chase, the graphics in this arent the best...and they arent really Triple-A game worthy, but then again, look at WoWS graphics...they arent exactly Crysis 3-level graphics...\n\n3) Speed of the matches\nThis one is a fun one. SO feels much quicker to get to the enemy, leaving less time to plan and read your favorite Bible Book while your R key does the rest like in WoWS. In SO, you get to the middle of the map much quicker (Possibly due to the small map size?), and it doesnt give you much time to ♥♥♥♥ around getting lost like in WoWS.\n\n4) Submarines\nI haven't played them yet, but they look interesting to say the least. From what Ive seen (And not PhlyDaily, if I could find a blade that's edgier than him, Id be the luckiest man on Earth), the Oxygen forces you to make choices that will affect your chances of survival by being forced to the surface every couple of moments to replenish oxygen, and a single torpedo hitting you will probably sink you. With the inclusion of the...oh wait Ill mention that next, with the next function, it pretty much balances the Sub out in terms of no Sneeki Breeki Iv Damke for you!\n\n5) Torpedo safe-zone\nWho knew that including a safe-zone from torpedos can help balance a game! I BET THOSE GUYS AT WARGAMING NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT THAT...\n\n6) Battleships\nBattleships seem to be actually worth the EXP in this game, whereas Heavy Cruisers always dominate WoWS to no end. BBs now have the ability to absolutely destwoy enemy ships with a single salvo, ranging from other BBs to HCs to LCs to CVs, and everything inbetween. For once I can actually go to enjoy Based Nagato /o_o/\n\n7) Gold is...much more expensive...\nWhile WG is pretty greedy, this game is even more greedy, in terms of the amount of gold you can buy...though to be fair, the 311 USD deal (Nice try goyims) is much better than WG if they tried a 1 dollar = 250 gold conversion (77758 (Rounded up) from WG compared to 155,500 (Plus 155,500 for your first purchase) by SO) for 311 USD.\n\n8) LOTS of ships\nSO has many historical ships that actually served in the Pacific and Atlantic Theatres, including most of the ships from BS:P (Which would be the closest match in terms of amount of historical ships), and they dont try to add names to ships THAT NEVER HAD NAMES,\n\n9) Gun reload times.\nMy Tenryuu in WoWS had a 5 second reload time on its 14cm guns. In SO is 12 seconds. Which do you think is the most realistic. Take your pick. Choose your poison. Whichever suits your fancy. SO is more realistic. Whatever floats your boat. Or sinks it.\n\n10) There's a tutorial that allows you to get into the game.\nIn WoWS, you dont really get any introduction, and you're essentially told "Go out there and shoot at things."

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FeldwebelKiro/recommended/390670/","FeldwebelKiro","We Wuz Kangs n' Shiet","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FeldwebelKiro/","189 products in account","Steel Ocean: A More Advanced WoWS for the Less Windowlicker-grade Members of Humanity\nTo preface this - I have been playing World of Warships since the Closed Alpha test, which while insanely fun and enjoyable experience - slowly turned to garbage as development advanced, and Wargaming continued dipping their filthy, vodka-coated hands into the WoWS pie. WoWS slowly became an unbalanced, overly-simplistic, insanely unenjoyable and mundane experience wherein Wargaming plays the usual role of being 100% incompetent at development, community skills (this includes listening to the playerbase more than literally never.), and balance. Now, I do not want to say I hate WoWS - but after playing this game, I find it increasingly more hard to root about for reasons to play WoWS more often than one or two matches.\n\nTo also give you perspective, I am an AVID Aircraft Carrier fan. I love my Japanese CV's, and was heartbroken to find that they were implemented in WoWS in such a laughably bad way. (Better torpedo bombers and more active wings simultaneously at the cost of less planes per wing, and useless fighters.) While this was acceptable for a short while, it increasingly grew more and more unbearable; patch after patch, faulty rebalance after faulty rebalance - and Japanese Carriers no longer had a purpose, with inferior fighters and torpedoes that have virtually no chance to cause flooding (easily neutering the warship), and coupled with new meta that arose wherein USN CV's use their numeric superiority of fighters to shoot down all opposition and then proverbially squat atop the enemy carrier and ♥♥♥♥ on the captain's head - I lost all remaining faith in Wargaming and had decided to quit playing WoWS to find new horizons.\n\nAfter Navyfield 2 failed in such an awful matter, I really needed to find a new game to play that was a naval combat MMO - and I was insanely lucky when my friend just so happened to link this game as a joke. A Chinese knockoff of World of Warships that is supposedly better than WoWS. After beating a dead horse and nagging at my friend about how ♥♥♥♥♥♥ WoWS is, I realized the futility of this and waited for Steel Ocean to be released. While the release slipped my mind at first, I recalled the game, downloaded it, and much to my shock and awe - played an infinitely better naval combat than World of Warships.\n\nTo begin - let us list the negatives, of which this game has surprisingly few.\n\nCons:\n\nAbsolutely heinous graphical performance. Both in literal performance and graphical appeal. The game runs poorly on my computer despite the game looking like it was made in 2008. (AMD HD Radeon 6970 Sapphire Dual-X)\n\nThe community understandibly, yet bafflingly seems completely braindead. Frequent teamkills, no idea as to what to do, useless Battleships not moving an inch from spawn, Carriers suiciding off into the enemy team. (Hopefully a meta begins to float around to shine light on what to do.)\n\nMap sizes either seem small, or Destroyers awfully fast. Granted, this might be an error entirely on my fault - but I can't help but feel like a few maps are far too easy to traverse for DD's and ends in a Battleship's untimely death. (Either that or superior captaining, I'll just leave that up to the playerbase.)\n\nMediocre UI elements. Such as a lack of grouping carrier-based aircraft together, clunky tabs, and awkward management of the tech tree.\n\nCringey voices for pilots, crew, captain, et cetera. An option for national crews would be amazing. (Japanese voiceovers for the IJN, German for the KM, accented English for the RN, et cetera.)\n\nPros:\n\nMuch more advanced and intense gameplay. Requiring you to micromanage aircraft significantly more (this includes assaulting with dive bombers and torpedoes; requiring you to manually set the path of assault and correcting it to compensate for movement, potential turning, and to avoid AA density. As well as the removal of EZ-mode aim assist, and a lot of UI elements that made WoWS far too simple to play. (Lead indicators, shell impact time estimates, auto torpedo and bomb drop, et cetera.)\n\nCUSTOM AIRCRAFT CARRIER LOADOUTS. This is the biggest point for me. This, this right here makes Carriers so much more damn fun. No ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ gimmicks, no "assymetrical balance", no preset loadouts - the ability to customize and tailor your aircraft carrier to fit your needs and wants. I love this so much.\n\nCONTROLLABLE SECONDARIES, ANTI-AIRCRAFT GUNS, AND DUAL-PURPOSE GUNS. This is the second biggest point for me. In WoWS, your faulty, ♥♥♥♥♥♥, AI-and-RNG driven AA and secondaries would consistently fire misses until you were either sunk or barely managed to survive. AA in WoWS is completely useless at lower tiers, and makes the grind much more unbearable and the playerbase's opinion of Aircraft Carriers inherently low. In this game, being sunk by aircraft means you had nobody to blame but yourself. Always remember to check the skies if you're in a battleship as you're destined to be targeted by carriers. Also, with the aid of secondary guns - you're more than capable of defending yourself in an aircraft carrier against Destroyers or surfaced Submarines. Also, this enables you to lay down more fire, more efficiently in Battleships and suppliment your high reload time on your main battery with rapid, low-damage, yet surpressive fire.\n\nBATTLESHIPS ARE USEFUL. I cannot emphasize this point enough, as a scorned lover of Battleships in WoWS; this is another huge point for me. Battleships are fun and useful in the right hands. I am early in the game for BB's (Proto Kongo), but it is just so damn enjoyable I don't even notice a grind to the Kongo 1931. I am extremely excited to see what course this game takes with battleships, and I cannot wait to see more choices in the Battleship lines.\n\nDestroyers now have a role outside of being torpedo-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, however this role is still retained. Destroyers can now hunt submarines utilizing depth charges. However, due to the lack of CL and CA on most teams - they are left to submarine hunt without much support outside of that, also considering they remain spotted as long as the Submarine is within radio distance of their allies - the DD has to swiftly shoot out their short-ranged depth charges, or utilize torpedoes. Either way, DD's finally have a role outside of being tedious.\n\nSubmarines. While this isn't much of a plus or negative to me, they're in the game - and whatdoyaknow; they're actually well-balanced and seem to be enjoyable. I cannot offer much input on this other than more ship and role diversity, but submarines are in the game and they're pretty okay.\n\nSpotting system in this game, after getting acquainted with something that doesn't work like garbage and has a clear and understandable function - is actually pretty good. Your ship must maintain a clear line-of-sight on the enemy vessel(s), or must be within radio range of allies that have spotted the enemy warship. While spotting distance is fairly low, this positively influences combat and keeps games from being long, drawn-out, and mundane.\n\nSummary:\n\nSteel Ocean may seem like a WoWS ripoff, but it is not. Drawing elements from multiple games, World of Warships, World of Tanks, the Battlestations series, Navyfield, et cetera. It is a moderately unique game and is worth at least an 8/10 for gameplay, mechanics, balance, and content. I hope the developers of Steel Ocean keep surprising new players with a fresh take on the newish Naval Combat MMO genre.","November 18, 2015","true","25.0"," 68 of 85 people (80%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","80","68","85","6","1"

Granted, there was very little information regarding the status of the game development, however, there was sense of community that our input was being received, and to some degree, acted upon.  One of the discussion that surfaced was the inclusion of submarines, and while the community embraced the possibility of testing said model, behind the scenes that topic had been shelved, and forgotten.  The community on the other hand, frequently raised the question, to which either mods were instructed to avoid it altogether, or Wargaming simply did not respond.\n-\nEventually, as the game developed, Closed testing began, the truth of there being no subs came to life in a very public manner with Wargaming’s own spokesman stating ‘there will be no subs in the game’, and other statements regarding how they don’t fit in the game – period.\n-\nI have been a Closed Alpha tester for World of Warships, and from the very first day I signed up in 2012, I have always maintained that submarines do fit, and properly balanced, the game would attract every possible sort of player.  Of course, this didn’t sit well with those carrying water for the devs, nor for anyone else for that matter, that aligned themselves with the status quo.\n-\nFor them, it was a creative decision.  For the fans, it would be a marketing disaster waiting to happen.\n-\nIn enters, Steel Ocean.\n-\nFrom a pure standpoint of marketing, this title brings relief to a specific market, players that have conceded that WoWs was the only fruit in the vineyard, the only game that provided some soft resemblance of our long departed Navy Field, and settled for WoWs.  In the back of mind, playing destroyers in a limited role, there was always that desire to use the fan tail, drop depth charges, chase submarines, and fully embrace naval combat both in surface warfare, and Anti Sub Warfare.\n-\nSteel Ocean delivers on all these points, and then some.\n-\nNot only is the gameplay fluid, dynamic, and challenging, the game provides every possible component that a full-cycle player would want, from diving to avoid bombers and torps, to hiding and ambushing passing ships, the game excels in these regards.\n-\nThe balance consideration is perfect, giving submarine commanders’ room to risk it all on the surface, dive to avoid contact, and lay in wait for an unsuspecting enemy contact.  There is a sense of drama that is what inspires many sub drivers to play this role, the challenge of supporting a push, guarding a choke point, or watching the base.  Besides these points, the full spectrum experience of having the ability to engage the enemy on the surface, below the surface, adds so much more strategic and tactical reasoning to the game, something the developers took time to develop, and get it right.\n-\nFor me, the simple inclusion of submarines into a massive player online experience is the icing on the cake.  For me, Steel Ocean is now my harbor away from home, preparing my submarine for combat, and having a place to have my cake, and eat it, too.\n-\nWell done.","November 25, 2015","true","12.1"," 50 of 61 people (82%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","82","50","61","4","8"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/astecarmyman/recommended/390670/","astecarmyman","astecarmyman","http://steamcommunity.com/id/astecarmyman/","3 products in account","This is not a bad game at all. If you enjoyed playing Battlestations Pacific or Navyfield, then you should be right at home with this game.\n\nFirst off the cons:\nThe UI is clunky. Let's face it, there are just a huge amount of tabs to sort through and when you are playing carriers there is no way to group together aircraft or zoom out the map and give pathing orders.  Also, when you are firing your cannons in the traditional scoped view, you have to constantly adjust and readjust with jerky camera movements. The lack of gun plane stabilization like that which is present in World of Warships (x key) is annoying but really hurts destroyers and cruisers.\n\nAverage graphics. World of Warships (the main game that this will be compared to) definitely has better visual fidelity. The models are not exactly to scale which is sometimes jarring but this is more than made up for by the vast features Steel Ocean brings to the table.\n\nPoor optimization. I play on laptop with an i5-5200u and HD5500 igpu and I just barely get 30fps (mostly around 20fps) with the settings on low. World of warships always stays above 30fps in the 40s however with all the torpedo particles and gunfire effects there is probably good reason for the slowdown. Especially torpedoes, I get frame drops when I use those.\n\nLow tier balance issues. Playing cruisers at low tiers will give you an awful grind. You will get pounded from long range by battleships that out-range you by quite a bit. Also Battleships tend to keep in the back of the map so you will have to go through the front line of submarines to get them.\n\nNow for the pros:\n\nSubmarines! The main selling point of the game, you can submerge and surface to avoid gunfire however with a large penalty to movement speed. Subs are very fragile but if you can sneak up on a carrier or battleship, you will definitely rebalance them. There are two dive states; shallow depth and crash depth. At shallow depth you can still fire your torpedoes and your oxygen (time allowed to stay submerged) will depleted slowly. You are still vulnerable to air and ship launched torpedos as well as depth charges. At crash depth nothing will be able to hit you except depth charges, so use this to dodge torpedos and try to stay clear of cruisers and destroyers.\n\nEach class of ship has a clear defined role. Like rock, paper, scissors, Steel Ocean has multiple classes of ships that are very effective against each other. Battleships will tear up cruisers like butter from long-range, while submarines prowl the seas for that lone BB and send him to Davey Jones Locker. Destroyers are fast and maneuverable with lots of torpedoes, high sonar capabilities, and depth charges(anti-sub). Cruisers are bigger and better armed than destroyers but are less maneuverable and have more of a difficult time landing depth charges on subs(anti-DD). Carriers are the jack of all trades, they can effectively sink shallow depth submarines and pose a large threat to battleships. Carriers are limited by a poor UI however, and you can only assign a maximum of 5 planes in one air group (you get multiple air groups). Manual AA fire is also very effective against planes.\n\nYou can control your secondary armament and AA fire! Are you tired of playing a horrible underpowered Kawachi with useless secondaries in World of Warships? Fear not! You can control all 14 of those devastating 152mm sponsoon guns and seriously harm any marauding destroyers. Dislike those scouts or fighter planes lighting up your position? Open fire with all guns blazing and shoot down those planes knowing that it is your aiming skill and not the ai doing the work!\n\nSteel Oceans has great potential as a Battlestations/Navyfield hybrid and could pose a threat to WoWs with proper optimization and a UI overhaul. Proper team play is very effective with designated roles, however like your average tomato WOT or WoWs player, you will not see coordination that often. Hunting for subs and battleships in submarine wolfpack is great fun and it is incredibly satisfying to know that those torpedoes you launched were from your skill alone. (NO aim assist for torpedoes) With time I think this game will truly start to shine, it just needs a bit of polish.","November 15, 2015","true","694.2"," 57 of 73 people (78%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","78","57","73","3","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198033208882/recommended/390670/","76561198033208882","WW1_Veteran","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198033208882/","27 products in account","I am really pleased with this game.  I am a longtime World of Tanks (WoT) player, and played about 1000 games in World of Warships (WoWS) since last fall.  I really love naval history, and tried my absolute best to enjoy World of Warships.  But then I found Steel Ocean...\n\nI uninstalled and reinstalled WoWS about 8 times over the last 6 months.  Why?  Becuase as much as I loved the concept, I felt that Wargaming (WG) just could not fix fun-killing aspects in gameplay.  Additionally, there was a critical lack of content: WoWS has been out just a couple months longer than Steel Ocean, yet there is still no Royal Navy tech tree, and no German battleships.\n\nSteel Ocean solved both problems for me: The gameplay is faster and more dynamic, the matches are more fast-paced and stress-free, and there is a wealth of content that bodes well for the future.\n\nLet's talk about the gameplay first, and how it is better than WoWS.\n\nFor me, WoWS really dropped the ball on aiming.  In that game, you can learn how to lead targets and know exactly where to hit a ship (ie, the citadel), but then RNG takes over and sends your shells into the water around the target.  It is incredibly frustrating and depressing.  Steel Ocean, by contrast, uses the World of Tanks-style aiming circle, which allows you to use your skill much more in aiming: Take the time to aim properly, and you will hit hard.  That is a much better system in my opinion than aiming correctly and saying a prayer to the RNG gods before you click.\n\nSteel Ocean also features faster games.  One of my constant gripes about WoWS was that it took forever for matches to unfold.  It was not unusual to spend 5 minutes sailing into position before firing a shot.  Furthermore, it was not unusual for matches to run the full 20 minutes.  And if you lost, you felt like you wasted a good chunk of time.\n\nNot so in Steel Ocean: It's more of an arcade experience, and that means you get into action fast, and the action is fast once you get in it. Matches don't run more than 8-10 minutes usually, and if you lose, no big deal.  Just play another fast, action-packed match.  I find this a lot better psychologically, and I feel less pressure.\n\nSteel Ocean has a better spotting system and it rewards spotting damage.  This allows destroyers to play their role as scouts.  In WoWS, destroyers are an utterly broken class that can see everyone while remaining invisible, then launch devastating spreads of up to 15 torpedoes at unsuspecting targets.  They spot targets for larger ships, too, but they are not rewarded for the damage these larger ships do to the spotted targets.\n\nSteel Ocean destroyers are not the all-destroying plague that they are in WoWS.  Rather, they are part of the team, providing the spotting that the bigger ships need.  Sure, they can use torpedoes at close range.  And here is another thing that Steel Ocean does better than WoWS: You can only fire one torpedo at a time, and you have to aim them yourself.  There is no lame "aim assist" for torpedoes.  Only your skill and positioning will determine if you hit.\n\nAnother problem with destroyers in WoWS was that they exploited a poor armor penetration system.  In WoWS, enormous battleship guns could "overpenetrate" small targets and cause minimal damage.  This led to the ridiculous situation in which destroyers could charge battleships, take a few hits from their enormous guns, and get away with it.  Worse, WoWS never even published the penetration numbers for all the guns in the game.  Steel Ocean, by contrast, tells you exactly how much armor a shell can penetrate, and it performs accordingly.\n\nWoWS' odd armor penetration mechanics also led to the bizarre situation in which attacking a ship bow-on was preferable to fighting broadside.  In other words, crossing the "T" was actually a poor tactical choice in WoWS, despite naval history to the contrary.  In Steel Ocean, by contrast, if you bring all your guns broadside and land a solid volley on a bow-on target, he will have a very, very bad day.  And this is only logical.\n\nSteel Ocean also features subs, which are something people in WoWS have wanted and never gotten.  Wargaming always said they would be impossible to balance, but Steel Ocean has proven that claim wrong, too.  Steel Ocean balances subs by limiting the amount of time they can spend submerged, and by forcing players to manually aim their torpedoes.  Furthermore, every ship in Steel Ocean has sonar, which can locate a sub in time to take precautions.  Additionally, Steel Ocean provides a hard counter to subs in the form of destroyers and cruisers, which are not only hard to torpedo, but can both permanently keep eyes on subs and destroy them with depth charges.\n\nAlthough I am not a sub player, I do not find subs game-breaking at all.  They are part of the team, and in my opinion they add to the overall wealth of content that is lacking in WoWS.\n\nUnlike WoWS, Steel Ocean also lets you manually control all your weapons systems.  As a battleship, for instance, you not only get to control your main guns, but your secondary battery, too.  And you get to shoot your AA guns when planes appear.  This adds another level of immersion and skill, not to mention fun.  In WoWS, both AA and secondaries were controlled by AI.  The secondaries could not hit a thing, and it was super frustrating.  So seeing the manual weapons control feature in Steel Ocean was like a breath of fresh air.\n\nConcerning content, the edge once again goes to Steel Ocean.  Unlike WoWS, Steel Ocean has full tech trees for Great Britain and Germany.  WoWS focuses primarly on the US and Japan, for which Steel Ocean has even more ships (and subs).   It also has way more premium ships of all types.\n\nI got sick of waiting for WoWS to release the British fleet.  A naval warfare game without the British is like plum pudding without the pudding.  Additionally, I was dying to play German battleships.  Steel Ocean has a full line of them.\n\nWoWS has wasted its time with fictitious Russian ships.  Russia was not exactly known as a pre-eminent naval power at this time in history.\n\nNow, are there flaws with Steel Ocean?  Certainly.  First off, there is a relatively small player base.  This makes for longish queue times and small matches.  Hopefully word of mouth and time will increase this number.\n\nSecond, the graphics and modeling are not as impressive as WoWS.  But to be honest, when I play a game I want to have fun.  If a game looks nice but isn't fun, who cares?  For me, the graphics are good enough; the gameplay makes them more than tolerable.\n\nThird, gold prices for premium ships are high.  But this is a bit misleading, because Steel Ocean provides numerous bonuses for gold purchases.  Unlike WG, which never offered bonus gold, Steel Ocean gives you double gold when you buy certain bundles.  So if you buy 25000 gold for $50, you actually get 50000.  This seems like a very reasonable deal to me, and far better than anything WG ever offered.\n\nSteel Ocean also allows you to "invest" your gold into a "growth plan."  When you research ships of each progressive tier (up to tier 8), you get a portion of your gold back, with interest.  By the time you research the Tier 8, you make DOUBLE the gold back you put in.  You also get a boatload (no pun intended) of free XP to help you buy necessary modules when you research each new tier.  When was WG ever so generous? (Answer: never).\n\nFourth, critics complain that the game is too twitchy, too fast.  They say the ships are too maneuverable and that they move unrealisitcally.  But I actually like this part of the game.  Unlike WoWS, you actually can dynamically dodge torpedoes and incoming fire, even as a battleship.  What makes this game fun is that it moves quickly.  Faster moving/turning ships are part of that experience.\n\nIn sum, Steel Ocean has its flaws.  But if you want a genuinely fun naval shooter, this is it.","April 11","true","87.6"," 39 of 46 people (85%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","85","39","46","4","2"

comes some more facts/advices for WOWS players want to try this game or/ anyone new to Steel Ocean:\nI-Community:\n-Beside Chinese,there are ALOT of Russians too.And they often speak their homeland language.Dont expect them to speak English.Couldnt think out a online-based game without these vodkas.\n-Team-killing is a part of this game.Dont even bother report them.There will be another guy.Deal with it.Me personally had once killed a guy,but that was his fault because he ran straight into my torps while they're heading to an enemy sub.\n-The World Chat is full of rude words,but beside its fun.\n-The chat censorship of this game is badly broken,your texts will be censored if your text contains a rude word even if its not meant to be rude.Example: p-♥♥♥-port,compe-♥♥♥-ion,GAY-view Mahat,responsi-BI-lity,etc...Idk why,but even the word "System" is censored.\n-Uneducated people are unavoidable,sometimes you say "Good luck" to them and they respond "F*ck you !".\nII-Ingame:\n-BBs are extremely powerful in term of range and firepower.One full-salvo can send you to the bottom of the ocean.Never take seriously with a BB unless you are a BB yourself,or a SS.\n-Good way to fight the BBs that is either another BB or/ dropping some torps.Torps will always scare them away,its a way to lure BBs out of smoke or whatever.Keep in mind that after you dropped torps,run out immediately,or else you will get screwed.Maybe you can take a SS and kill them,which is also effective.\n-Never go alone if you are not a BB.Since you cant return fire for a long-range,you will become an easy target for the BBs.\n-BBs turrets rotation are much faster than in WOWS,only like 30-35 seconds for a 360 degrees turn while it takes decades in WOWS to just turn the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ guns 10 degrees to the whatever,not to mention the reloading time.\n-Torps are quite much a 'superweapon' in Steel Ocean,it takes just 2-3 hits to destroy every kind of ships in this game.\n-While torps have insane damage as I mentioned,they are SUPER slow.They are almost useless against fast and high maneuverability targets if they are any further than 1.5 km.Only recommended to launch torps at long range against BBs and CVs.\n-CLs/CAs are important too.Their guns are not as powerful as the BBs,but due to their fast-reload,they can pump down rain of shells on the enemy.They are used in many different missions:\nProvide fire support,Seek&destroy DDs,scouting areas,escorting,defending base,...etc...\n-Everyone might already knew this,but I will still tell you guys:Lead the target.\n-CLs/CAs in Steel Ocean reload slower than the WOWS counterparts,but its still enough to become the "Assault Rifle of the Fleet".\n-Anything at low health shouldnt get near CLs/CAs,or they will mercilessly throw hundreds of shells toward it.Sinking is unavoidable.\n-Good way to counter the CLs/CAs is blow them up from afar with BBs.\n-Dont play as a CV unless you know exactly what are you doing.They are very complicated to control but once you master you can conquer the sea with them.\n-Let your CV sitting duck at the start point and just control planes is a bad habit.Since the enemy carrier may know that habit, they can send a bunch of diver bomber/torps bomber at you and so you are guaranteed to be a new home for the fishes.Instead,move your carrier somewhere else safe and sit there.If you see any sign that you have been spotted, move again.\n-Good counters against the CVs are...basically everything.Everything that can get close to a CV.Since CVs often have weak self-defense weapons,so its easy to kill them.Beware of their planes,but thats unlikely because they tend to be more focus on dodging your strikes rather than controlling planes.\n-SS are beast.A small,stealthy beast.They play hide and seek.Their torps are devastating,mainly because you cant kill them before they launch torps.If the SS players are pro enough,their torps would be undodgable.However,they do have weaknesses.\n-SS should avoid messing with DDs/CLs.They are have far superior speed,and they are equipped with ASW weapons.\n-Torps can hit SS if they dont dive deep.\n-Good way to "troll" a SS is parking the ship right on them.They cannot surface so they will eventually run out of oxygen and die.\n-DDs are the backbone of the Fleet.Their mission mainly include:Scout,Seek&destroy SS,escort.\n-Their main weapon is torps launcher,so make a good use of it.\n-Good way to counter DDs is leave the CLs/CAs to deal with them.","December 5, 2015","true","108.8"," 82 of 118 people (69%) found this review helpful 52

Yes, it is true that it is extremely similiar to WoWs at first sight, but the same could be said for the countless Minecraft-looking games out there and they are rarely dissed as rip-offs, right?\n\nThis game is much less realistic than WoWs, yet is it much more fun than WoWs.\n\n+You control all of the weaponry on your vessel. The minimum number of weapons you will have at your command is 2, which is the maximum number in WoWs.\n\n+You can use AA guns, you can use depth charges, you can use the battleship's secondaries.\n\n+All this versatility creates an added value when you're driving relatively slow vehicles such as ships. You won't be waiting for reloads more than you shoot.\n\n+Subs are fun not just for sub users, but also for sub hunters. It's extremely satisfying to dodge a sub's torps and see it desperately try to run away as you close in for a depth charge attack.\n\n+Battleships are super fun. Your main armament covers almost all of the map, but aims very slow. You'll find yourself sitting in the back and raining shells over extreme ranges, and switch to fast reloading secondaries when an enemy closes in.\n\n+No aim indicators for torpedoes, neither when launching nor when dodging. It's much more skill based here.\n\n+Salvoes don't fall short and long at the same time and magically miss your target in a perfectly aimed shot unlike they usually tend to do in WoWs.\n\n-/+ Graphics aren't great, but who cares? They're not bad either.\n\n- Ship handling is simply funny. They brake like cars and reverse very easily. It's sometimes easier to stop when you detect an incoming torpedo salvo rather than try to angle your ship.\n\n\nI've never even once thought of investing money into WoWs.

And russians. Oh boy, seen so many "♥♥♥♥ blyat idi naxuj" already...\n4) Some roles (mainly DDs and CLs) are quite heavily restricted because of their low caliber guns dealing slim to none damage to decently armored ships (yes, armor is actually a thing in this game), and also due to the fact HE works differently than WoWs (HE does not act like ♥♥♥♥ing incendiary rounds/flamethrowers, but as actual explosive ammo dealing more damage than AP ammo to lightly armored targets)\n5) Kind of a con, kind of not - there is no aim assist, neither for artillery neither for torpedoes, meaning it'll take some time to get used to leading your shots, especially true for torpedoes\n6) Graphics are noticeably worse than WoWs, yet the game still runs a bit worse than WoWs\n\nShould you play this game? Hell why not, it's not P2W (some could argue though), it's free, and the grind until tier 6 is actually relatively small.

When the developers of that game announced that there was going to be a similar game that dealt with ship combat, I was very excited.  However, after playing World of Warships I found that game lacking in several respects.  Most noticably was with regards to battleships.  After losing interest with it, I had hoped to find something more engaging, more complex and more historical in it's feel.  Well, Steel Ocean is it!  It is what I envisioned for WoW, and then some!  Here are some specifics:\n\n1) All ships have access to their full armament, including main batteries, secondary batteries, anti-aircraft guns, torpedos and even depth charges!  The weapons seem to be reasonably historically accurate, and the access to secondary batteries makes battleships absolutely devistating if you learn how to use them well!\n\n2) Submarines!  These are in the game and done very well.  They are both playable, dangerous, and also very vulnerable if used badly!  You have the ability to operate at a shallow depth (equivalent to periscope depth) or dive deep.  Each depth has plusses and minuses, and you have to watch your oxygen and surface when it runs low.  Very nicely balanced and a great addition to the game.\n\n3) Light and Heavy Cruisers!  The developers were smart enough to split cruisers into their real-life categories.  Much better than lumping them all together!\n\n4) Night combat!!!  This is my favorite, favorite feature!  You have access to starshells and spotlights!  Too bad they don't have a historical map of Iron Bottom Sound...  If they did, I'd be in heaven!  Regardless, night combat is VERY VERY fun!\n\n5) Better tech trees.  This may be totally subjective, but it seemed as if the tech trees are composed of better ship selections.  I'm still hoping they add more, but I am very happy with the selections for both the US Navy and Imperial Japanese Navy.  Also, I'm not seeing the changes that WoW felt necessary to balance the game - for example, the fictitious float versions of fighter aircraft that they added to between-the-wars ships to balance out their lack of AA.  Although a "float claude" was an attractive invention, it is totally developer fantasy - nothing else.\n\nOkay, so I've given you a lot of upsides.  In fairness, I'll give you the few downsides I've found:\n\n1)  The graphics, while still nice, aren't quite as eyepopping as WoW, although you can use the F8 key to toggle off the UI and make some nice screenshots.  The water looks good, as do the islands, but the ships are less detailed than WoW.\n\n2)  The economy.  It uses a similar system to WoT, WoW, etc.  The problem is the gold.  Your ability to purchase gold is limited, if I read the instructions correctly, to a single purchase of each of the different gold packages.  For example, there is one package that costs you $1 and gives you a total of 1000 gold (again, if I read the instructions correctly), but you can only buy it once.  The next time you try to purchase gold, it will not be available.  There will still be the other packages of gold, which number less than ten, but they get quite pricey rather quickly.  I seriously doubt I'll ever purchase the last one, which is over $100.  Since gold is tied to purchasing ship slots this will be an issue for me early on.  There do seem to be other ways to get gold, including an "investment" program, which seems designed to keep you around until you reach the higher tiers.  I assume this was all done to prevent players from using cash to get too much of an advantage over other players.  Seems silly to me, since you can only play with one ship at a time, if this is the case.\n\nIn conclusion, I find Steel Ocean to be most of what was good with it's competition, World of Warships, plus much, much more!  Great game!","December 29, 2015","true","37.6"," 28 of 37 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","28","37","0","4"

While on the surface it seems like a poor man's WoWS, it comes around much closer to the fast-paced fun and tactical depth of NF2. And hey, at least it has subs and manual AA control, and the planes look actually convincing.\n\nWhile I maintain that the best format for a tactical ship-to-ship combat game is the bird's eye view, Steel Ocean has several other qualities that make it much more fun to play than its main competition at the moment. Many of these are adapted from other games to the point that has made some people scream ripoff, but I don't care about the origin, my concern is the implementation. And this game's got it.\n\nFor one, the game's gunnery control is quite similar to the artillery view from World of Tanks. You get an aiming reticle displaying the shot deviation, and even lowly destroyers get a bird's eye gunnery view. For comparison, in WoWS many ships are limited to gunsight that's essentially fixed to the surface, making judging distances very difficult. Furthermore, WoWS reticle shows no shot deviation, so you have little idea at all where to expect your shells to land. The RNG is in both games, but in WoWS you aren't even given any clues as to how to account for it.\n\nPerhaps most important advantage that SO has over WoWS is the ship maneuvering. In this regard SO is closer to the spirit of NF2, sacrificing simulator feeling for agility and speed. As such, ships accelerate, decelerate, and maneuver quite quickly, which keeps the action fast paced and makes it possible for weaker ships to not instantly face game over when making a single bad decision. In WoWS, ships move and accelerate very slowly, which would be fine if the game was about long-range fleet combat on the open seas - but it is not. Likewise, the turret traverse in SO is around the same as NF2, and not the lumbering, glacial movements of WoWS guns. Overall WoWS is in the uncanny valley where it is trying to be a simulator and an arcade game at the same time. Like NF2, SO doesn't have this sort of problem, because the maneuverability of the ships is more in line with the kind of combat that consists most of the gameplay.\n\nOverall the balance seems to be pretty decent so far, although I've yet to try the submarine and carrier gameplay. Subs are perhaps too easy to spot for now, but a wolfpack can turn the game around quickly if left unchecked by escorts. The ASW weapons are powerful, but balanced by being quite difficult to aim on a competently maneuvering sub. Carrier planes aren't the instant death dealers from WoWS thanks to the manual AA weapons giving ships a decent chance of shooting them down. In comparison, especially in lower WoWS tiers torpedo bombers were nigh impossible to evade or shoot down and the only counter to carriers was other carriers.\n\nDetection ranges are shorter than in WoWS, which I find positive because it gives smaller ships more usability as scouts, as well as increasing their survivability. Torpedoes have range that's more in line with NF2, rather than the knife-fight range of WoWS. For balance, they have a relatively long arming distance, so using them well means more than just sprinting up close and letting torps loose at point blank.\n\nOverall, SO has gameplay that's much better thought out and balanced as a whole than that of WoWS, and I'm positive that fellow NF2 veterans will find this the game they're looking for. It's fun, more oriented on player skill, and has plentiful tactical options.\n\n-Noba the grumpy CA guy","November 14, 2015","true","281.3"," 22 of 31 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","22","31","0","0"

If you take a look at the menue, the games arworks/UI and most of the gameplay mechanics ect, its a 1:1 copy of world of tanks and world of warships!\n\nWhy world of tanks? Because it uses many gameplay mechanics of WOT!\nSo there is premium ammo you can get with "gold" only (some sort of pay to win), because you cant buy them with credits, sadly... but i havent had any game, where premium ammo was making a difference so far!\nCamouflage can also be bought permanently with gold or temporary by spending credits.\nThe modification system works exactly the same as it does in world of tanks, you can research by far much more modifications as in world of warships!\nThere are also 5 crew slots, like in wot, but you use the whole crew for all ships! (but you can recruit more commanders and divide them to seperate ships by creating special ship lineups)\nSo there is no retraining mechanic!\n\n\n\nPROS: Okay now lets quickyl point out, what steel ocean does better or worse than WOWS!\n\n1. Tracers, Projectiles moving much faster, distances are barely the same but the whole hiting mechanics work much better. Because of the faster shells, the gameplay feels less arcade like and makes it more realistic.\n\n2. Damage model is much more complex. You can set ships on fire by using HE aswell! There are also critical hits, that destroy specific ships components, wich can be repaired with a repair tool! (You have only a limited amount)\nYou also have a seperate fire extinguisher, with limited use!\nFor AP shells, there are no citadel hits in the first place, but its much more important to penetrate enemys armor!\nSo battleships are muuuch more durable, you cant simply set em on fire with tiny guns the whole time. They feel much more like heavy tanks in world of tanks!\nAlso, you can use every kind of gun installed on your ship manualy and you can fire at whatever you want, even ships can be damaged with your AA guns!\n\n3. There is no unlimited torped amount or ammo amount on your ship and you have to buy them with credits, like in world of tanks. What makes spaming torpedos like a braindead zombie not possible! As mentioned already, you can maualy controll all kind of guns! AA, main gun, secondary guns, water bombs, torpedos,...\nYou also can switch between different ammo types, like AP, HE, HESH,.. And you can also set guns to salve or single fire mode!\n\n4. Aiming mechanics are not as arcadelike as in world of warships. First, you have an aiming circle like in world of tanks, it takes a while until you can fire accuratly after moving your turrets! So the circle gets smaller if you dont move the mouse to much! Also for long range guns, you can switch to an "artillery" view, exactly as it works in world of tanks, playing artillery!\n\n5. There is a "rating" system, yes no joke! So depending on how well youre doing in a random match, you get rating points added to your current rating. Means, the better you performe, the more points you get and the stronger your opponents get. This doesnt mean, you have to face enemies with higher tiers, you just get enemies close to your rating! Guess thats someting, most veteran world of tanks players always wanted!\n\n6. Submarines and YES, the gameplay mechanics work very well!!! So while wargaming isnt able or willing to find ways for a nice submarine gameplay for WOWS, in steel oceans they did! Subs are very hard to play but in the end its a very rewarding and balanced gameplay experience! You cant stay very long under water because youll lose oxigen. And others can detect you by using sonars, random fired torpedos are always dangerous, because subs are slow under water.\nThere is also a second level, so you can go into deep waters, where its harder to get detected but you drain oxigen faster and you cant fire any torpedos and your speed is even slower!\n\n7. The Interface during a battle is much more polished and gives you much more informations you need! Maneuvring and firing, zooming ect, also works way better and is much more responsive.\n\n8. There is so much more gameplay as in WOWS. You can earn experience for your crews AND unlock perks aswell! Get research points for your ships, for your modules! You can earn ratings! You can even earn special, very rare crew members, that can be trained like normal crews but offer more unique abilities! You can also play ranked games and earn military ratings (despite the normal rating you get from random games)\nThere are also tonns of events, changing dailie or weekly and you get rewards for completing task.\n\n9. Statistics and rewards, achievements are way more complex, much more of them in steel oceans! As example: you get experience and credits for spotting enemies and damaged by your teammates! (same like playing scout in WOT)\nYou can also protect your allies with your AA guns or by using sonar and hunt submarines with your water bombs! The game offers much more teamplay as WOWS does!\nYou also get more serious rewards/medals after a battle. You have complex satistics about every player and very detailed match-reports. Also close to world of tanks!\n\n10. The game is much more skill based, not as much RNG as WOWS! It has lot of diversity and offers lot of options, opportunitys because of its complex gameplay mechanics and the submarines!\n\n11. Motivates the player much longer while WOWS gets boring after 3 games per day already.\n\n12. The game offers more gamemodes as WOWS! As in WOT you can turn them on or off in the options. Even night battles are possible!\n\n\n\n\n\nCONS: The downsides of Steel Ocean!\n\n1. Graphics are not good at all, guess this is by far the worst part of Steel Oceans. Technicaly the game is 5 - 10 years behind world of warships! Feels like playing counter strike 1.6! Guess this is the main reason why so many casual gamers refuse to play Steel Ocean instead of WOWS!\n\n2. Arworks of people/crew look like anime drawings, so its totaly obvious this game comes from china! Everything else, the wallpapers, artworks, the menue, barely everything look 1:1 like WOT or WOWS.\n\n3. The community is very tiny compared to WOWS. Means you will have to wait 3-5 mins in the queue untill youll find a match most times. And i cant tell how long this gets if you play at tiers high end tiers.\n\n4. Also small arcade maps like in world of warships.\n\n5. Ships maneuvering much more arcade like, even more as in world of warships. Breaking or accelerating happens much faster as in WOWS.\n\n6. Its hard to get informations about current developement and upcomming patches, news about the future of the game are not existent at steam!\n\n7. Animations are not good compared to WOWS. The spalshing water in front of the ship looks so incredible bad... Coast dont even have serious waves...\n\n\nSo steel ocean is looking bad (honestly), its game engine feels like 10 years old and there are no physics, water animation looks horrible, islands and environment are even worse.\nI would say WOWS is more like the new SW: Battlefront. Looks amazing but has very, very simple gameplay mechanics and lacks lot of diversity!\nOn the other hand, Steel Ocean is much more complex in terms of gameplay mechanics, it feels more like Counter Strike 1.6! Very crapy, bad looking engine but more challening, more teamplay oriented, it has a rating system that makes sure, you find people at your skill level, even in random games. (ranked has its own rating system, the military rating)\nSubmarines work very well, they are quit good balanced and fit good into the game!\n\nSteel Ocean has by far the better gameplay and more complex game mechanics!\nWorld of Warships is way better looking but offers only very few diversity and gameplay mechanics!\n\nSteel Ocean would be totaly superrior to world of warships with a better game engine / graphics, no doubt!","March 9","true","189.0"," 17 of 25 people (68%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","68","17","25","2","9"

I really like what they did with many things, for example the battle ships get a "Hawk-eye" mode were you can shoot with increased range like an artillery tank from WoT. Your guns can full salvo or shoot one shell, even if it is a dual or triple battery. So basically this game took ideas from a few games and inovated it.

I originally gave it a thumbs up, and I would give it two thumbs up if they implement real penalties for damaging/killing one of your own team mates. I would suggest a 24 hour ban on any player that sinks more than 2 allies in a 24 hour interval. Accidental collateral damage is going to happen in any war simulation but it takes some serious malice or gross negligence to repeatedly completely "write off" a friendly warship.\n\n==================================\n\nUPDATE:\n\nSo after 100 hours of play, I had enough of the toxic "to hell with everyone else" community of "Steel Ocean" and decided to try "World of Warships" which is also free to play. After about 10 battles in World of Warships I can tell you that I'm VERY glad I switched. I have not been purposely shot by my team mates, or rammed, cursed at, or forced to tolerate infantile player names, or torpedoed in the back even once. In fact the team mates that I have had in World of Warships have been keen and civil naval warfare enthusiats, AND damaging your own team mates' ships is actively discouraged by significant reward penalties. The gameplay in World of Warships is much more realistic including ship fire crews, jammed steering gear, engine damage, gun mount damage, citadel damage, etc. The graphics are far better, and there is PVE combat and progression available instead of only PVP.\n\nTLDR;\n\nTry World of Warships. Its also FREE. You have nothing to lose and you will thank me later.\n\nPS: I am a retired naval officer.","December 24, 2015","false","100.4"," 37 of 63 people (59%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","59","37","63","3","2"

What I like is their is submarine's, Germany has its own line of ship from the start. The game is not even two months old and I feel it is good shape. Graphics are great I'm not into eye candy makes or breaks the game for me as long as gameplay is good which it is. Con to the game still seems to be a low population of players but its still relatively new game so as time goes on should pick up. Sonar system for finding subs seems to be way to easy because you can see a 3d outline of the sub underwater and not hard to see which way the subs moving which makes playing subs harder to evade destroyers if you played Battlestations Midway dont expect the same kind view from under water all you see is 3rd person above the water in subs. Ship seem to accelerate way too fast maybe they will fix this soon. Carrier planes animation makes planes look like jets taking off and landing not really a big issue just looks odd. Only 4 cons I can think of try this game out I was skeptical at first but love this game now you will too if you like naval warefare.\n\nUpdate. Ship acceleration is still way too fast  WW1 battleships get up to full speed in 5 seconds cant wait to play ships 20+ years newer be like a patrol boat speed in a Bismarck. Destroyers are just like in WoWs unfortunately so when your in a BB your blind to them except for when they broadside you with torpedoes and get seal clubbed. So line of sight just like WoWs. Their are some things you can do to increase your sight range but doesnt seem to help. Be nice to make the maps bigger so can have better line of sight like Midway but that wont happen. Anyways just how I feel about the game.","January 2","true","93.9"," 15 of 23 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","15","23","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dpsimulation/recommended/390670/","dpsimulation","DPSimulation","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dpsimulation/","298 products in account","With 62 hours playtime, I feel I can now give more thoughts on Steel Ocean.\n\nFront End\n\nIt took some time to figure out where everything was, but i've started to learn about things such as the barracks and tech tree. The latter has now had the British fleet introduced meaning there are now six different paths to go down, although the French and Chinese are limited to one 'gold' ship each.\n\nI've noticed that many people have complained about 'grinding' in this respect, or that the game is 'pay to win'. I suppose it entirely depends how much time you want to give the game. Me personally, I feel that there is enough variation in battles that I can go out there and try and earn EXP for upgrades and give myself a wide variation of fleet options, in fact I quite enjoy it. For others that won't be good enough, people naturally want to upgrade as fast as possible and will pay to do so.\n\nGameplay\n\nI really like the game and play almost daily depending on how well the server wants to welcome me during a battle. The gameplay itself is good, and as someone who plays primarily as a battleship, there is something to like about the skill required to hit a moving target 5km away.\n\nA recent update seems to have also added improvements to how the ships look when turning at high speed, with a very visible leaning motion, a nice touch. Also with the recent promised addition of the British tech tree, battles are becoming much more variable and as I have rarely been matched in the same battle type in consecutive games, the whole variation makes it more interesting for me.\n\nTeamkillers & Community\n\nThe first problem that I have come across and something I have seen discussed widely on the forums, these 'teamkillers' seem to generally be denoted in battle by a blue name? They are basically there to mess up your day and it's something that I feel needs addressing. This is especially more relevant as I have seen discussions on forums that suggest that should you defend yourself against these people, it is at detrement to the rewards you yourself receive at the end of a battle.\n\nIt's important to note that the teamkillers I speak of are not newer users firing torpedoes without looking, which is itself is a problem but an understandable one. Teamkillers for me are ones that come in all shapes and forms, they roam the initial battle area with no purpose other than to kill you in close combat at the earliest opportunity.\n\nIt's also worth noting that any teamkiller can be reported during battle with an option specifically for reporting them for firing on teammates. However, as many of these users have had Chinese usernames and the game is seemingly developed in China, I'm not sure anything is being done, or will be done given I've seen the same names repeatedly doing the same thing without sanction.\n\nServer\n\nThe biggest problem with Steel Ocean, presumably for users not in North America at least. Given that when loading the game, NA is the only available server, this is leading for problems that are well documented on forums. Although I cannot measure an exact percentage, i'd wager that 20% of the time, battles are unplayable due to an enormously high ping, for me at least. In a handful of cases, ping has risen to it's highest level and after 30 seconds of the battle freezing, i've been thrown out completely.\n\nAnother small portion of the time the ping rises sufficiently high that weapons cannot be discharged or the ship cannot be manoeuvred, this may manifest itself by putting you in an uncontrollable spin until the ping drops to such a level that you can regain control. The main issue for me here is that there is no discernable way to recognise it will happen, it's very random and a battle can be fine for the first 5 minutes, only to become unplayable at a key point. Equally, it can start as unplayable and then become playable after a minute or so. Other times a whole battle can pass of without a problem.\n\nFurther servers have been requested in on forums, most commonly one in the EU. This has been acknowledged a couple of times by devs and I got the impression that it was being seriously considered. Another post this morning by a dev on the forums suggests to me that it isn't being seriously considered and it's more of a problem for us than it is for them.\n\nOverall\n\nThe gameplay and general community experience means I am still going to recommend this game, the teamkiller issue isn't enough to sway towards a non-recommendation. Server issues are swaying towards this though and should the situation get any worse than it currently is and make the game unplayable for longer periods, I'll have to consider it.","November 12, 2015","true","122.7"," 43 of 76 people (57%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","57","43","76","4","0"

I would suggest getting WoWs over this and if you want to have fun driving/operating a submarine, there is a game out there somewhere called Naval Assault The Killing Tide. It's more fun.

If you are familiar with Wargaming games then you'll understand how the progression system works. The graphics are decent and you are able to manually control AA guns and secondary guns.\n\nI do not know how to feel about submarines, but they do provide a distraction for destroyers so battleships can deal damage. If you played WOWS, you know what I mean.\n\nGameplay is like anything other online game. You would get people going off to do their own thing and there is rarely any teamwork. But on the rare occasion that there is, it is awesome and can be quite cinematic.\nOne game that I remember in particular is when I was gunning down a destroyer and after it sunk, I lost most of my health from torpedoes. The torpedoes came from a submarine and the last destroyer on my team sailed back and forth screening me from torpedoes and dropped depth charges. I spent the rest of the game dodging torpedoes and the destroyer continued dropping charges until he sunk the submarine.\nIt might not sound too great, but it was definitely a heart racing moment to see who would win as submarines are sneaky little buggers.\n\nNow onto what I personally don't like about this game.\n\nThe ships do not handle like ships. They do not feel like they have any weight to them. It doesn't matter what class of ship it is, they all start and stop on a dime.\n\nThe HUD can also be very confusing. There is a lot of information, but it is not marked very clearly and it is easy to mistake one indicator for something else. For those who have seen TheRussianBadger's BF4 video when he shows a satirical example of cluttered HUD, this game's HUD felt something like that.\n\nAlso, I was not able to remap my keys to exactly how I wanted them. I played many hours of WOWS and I tried to remap my keys to be similar but there were not enough options to do so.\n\nThere are also plenty of ships to choose from, but there are also a lot of ships that do not exist in this game. Such as the German H-class, Japanese A-150 class, and American Montana-class, as well as most Russian ships. I personally do not like 'paper ships' so that is a negative for me. And yes, I know WOWS is no different.\n\nLike I said, a lot of my dislikes are my own personal opinions. Other than that, this game is not bad. If you like World War II era warships, give this game a whirl and see what you think of it.","April 17","false","2.5"," 17 of 28 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","17","28","0","0"

WoWS has a better grasp of the ranges involved in Naval Combat, and is slow paced enough that it feels more what you'd expect from a simulator.\n\nNow, we'll do how SO beats WoWS:\n\n-Less RNG dependant:  Big guns get calibrated by their crews between shots.  SO has a mechanic for this, WoWS does not.\n\n-The gold system is better...not only can you buy packages (which, the first time you buy them, you get double the gold), but you can buy into a growth plan that has additional benefits as you level, as well as giving you back more gold than you put in over time.\n\n-Premium time can be bought on the standard daily countdown method, or a per-battle method...meaning that if you don't have time to go into the game often, you can use the per-battle method of premium time and not feel pressured to play because your prem time is running out...meaning this game is much more accessible for casual players.\n\n-Battle scarring is much better in SO than WoWS.\n\n-You can fly any country's flag over any ship...you can have a Fubuki-class destroyer flying British flags, or you can have a South Carolina-class battleship flying Japanese colours, if you so desire.\n\n-Ships, ships, and more ships.  This game has way more ships in it than WoWS.\n\n-Fire, the eternal bane of BB's in WoWS is still in SO...but done much more realistically.  If your deck is on fire, it doesn't eat away at your survivability...the only time fire does that is if it's in something important.\n\n-Control every major weapon on your ship.  Your main guns, your secondaries, your heaviest AA guns, torpedo launchers, and depth charge launchers.\n\n-Subs.  This game proves that subs can work in this genre, and they work well.\n\n-The game doesn't baby its players with a lead-indicator for torpedoes...it respects its players intellengence, assuming that people will be able to figure out how to lead enemy ships and develop torpedo strategies on their own.\n\n-Carriers have more options to choose from for their planes, and aren't locked in with pre-set squadron arrangements.  If you want to use nothing but torpedo bombers, go ahead!  You might regret it, but you can do it.\n\n-Unique ships, like the Ise BBV (part carrier, part battleship) and the French sub with the big cruiser guns...yes, these ships actually existed.\n\n-Every ship can launch smoke bombs, as long as you buy the consumeable.\n\n-Night battles, complete with flares and searchlights to seek out and illuminate your enemy.\n\n-Maps that have vision-obscuring fog patches around Islands.\n\n-Components to tailor your ship more towards your playstyle without sacrificing the feel of what that ship is really all about, or making it over powered.\n\nThis game has its competition beat, hands down.  While it is a faster paced game covering a smaller area when it comes to distances, it isn't overly crammed so you lose the immersion...it balances the need for direct player interaction without sacrificing too much towards the 'arcady' spectrum.\n\nTrying to go back to WoWS after playing this feature-rich game is nearly impossible.  Being subjected to massive RNG again is intolerable.  Watching planes enter your AA field and linger for long periods of time before bombing you at their leisure is annoying.\n\nSteel Ocean is my game of choice, and I make no bones about it.","April 6","true","59.0"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","9","13","0","0"

Time-limited diving with a lengthy recharge, and destroyers and cruisers have depth charges that can wreck you at any tier. They can also hit you with torpedos at periscope depth. Death against unattentive battleships and carriers, though. Hard to hit while surfaced.\n\nBattleships have a long-range view, like the slanted artillery mode in Armored Warfare. Guns are hard to aim but accuracy improves if you shoot at a single area. Lots of BB players forget to exit arty mode though and get torpedoed to death. BBs include manually operated secondary guns to hit those destroyers and such that sneak in. Can't do anything to subs except sit on them.\n\nCarriers have some number of deck slots where you can assemble your own squadrons to send out, of scouts, fighters, tbombers or dbombers. Tbombers are not overpowered. All planes die quickly to people manually directing AA, so they're best against busy people.\n\nDestroyers are just fun as hell.\n\nDon't have an opinon on cruisers yet. Like bigger destroyers, so not as nimble.","November 15, 2015","true","79.5"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","11","17","0","0"

It's certainly not a bad game, but there isn't enough as of this moment that would convince me to switch from WoWS. Submarines are not my favorite part of naval warfare. With a smaller community and dev team than Wargaming, the game struggles to find its way out of the shadow of its competitor. Optimization and graphics obviously could use some work, and there never seem to be enough players on. Additionally, I have no idea who the developers even are and whether or not they want to appeal to their community as WG does with WoWS.\n\nDifferences with WOWS -Larger teams - to ensure that you never catch a break.\n-Firing main batteries feels much more heavier; your shots have weight.\n-No target tracking - I guess if you want to have a more "immersive" or "skill-based" experience, this is a plus.\n-WoT-style aiming - point and wait for the aiming circle to tighten. Honestly, I find this to just be annoying, as the accuracy is already impacted when you maneuver your ship(same as WoWS).\n-Submarines(DDs get depth charges). "was it that hard wargaming??? look see this makes the game totally superior to WoWS!!!"\n-All ships in the game are more or less actual WWII-era, unlike WoWS which puts post-WWI era ships to fill up low tier slots. So if that tickles your immersion fancy, there you go.\n-Secondary armament/AA is manual-control. This is an interesting feature, but you won't want to be constantly switching back and forth when you are being attacked from both sea and air.\n\nThat is pretty much everything that is notable. Certainly, if you have had enough of WoWS for the time being and want to try something perhaps slightly different, give this game a try. However, I have returned to WoWS. Maybe you can wait for WT Naval Forces when it restarts development sometime very late into 2016.","January 3","true","1.6"," 15 of 25 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","15","25","0","0"

Oh don't worry though, there are pleanty of unawere players for you destroyer captains to sink your torpedoes into (I'm talking from experiance).\n\nMy only to gripes with this game are that firstly there is no european dedicated server, but you can connect to the US server via a proxy which I've found to have very stable connection. My second gripe is that sometimes it takes a while to find a match, but that is because there are a lack of players in the game, at least compared to WOWS or WOT and the matches it does find are pretty balenced, even with the lack of players.\n\nAnyway it's a free to play game, download it and decide for yourself, you have nothing to lose either way.","March 30","true","15.6"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","7","10","0","0"

Big guns that have big booms make a good game.\n\nOn a more serious note: Steel Ocean functions like World of Tanks, (or World of Warships more rather,) but with slightly less graphic fidelity. The player base is a little small, but the community is hoping for more members soon.\n\nIt's a free to play game, so there's no risk to you by playing it, however there are micro-transactions. In reality, they shouldn't be considered when downloading this game because all you can really do with your real-world cash is buy gold for purchasing some exclusive ships and decorating your owned vessels in game. Some argue it's pay-to-win, but really it makes no difference, at least to me.\n\nWhat I like most about Steel Ocean is the fact that there is a lot less grinding for EXP and Silver when compared to the WoT games, assuming you're a decent player. It's more historically accurate, there is a diverse selection of ships and ship types from multiple factions (though there are some factions with very few ships to choose from. USA and Japan are your best bets if you want a larger selection.) The game is easy to grasp but requires at least some skill to master and a good amount of teamwork. Ensure everyone plays their roles well.\n\nYou can choose from:\n- Light Cuisers\n- Heavy Cruisers\n- Destroyers\n- Submarines\n- Battleships\nand\n- Aircraft Carriers\n\nSo there you have it. It's an all-around good multiplayer experience. I hope you enjoy your playtime if you choose to get Steel Oceans, and if you do, I will see you on the sea of battle!","January 31","true","12.5"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","11","18","0","0"

I'm not going to say that this is the best Naval Warfare game out there. Nor am I going to say it's better than World of Warships, because I've never played it. But what I can tell you for certain is, that like all Free-To-Play games, there will be grinding, anger, censoring, tears, happiness and satisfaction.  As a new player, you'll launch the game for the first time, login and then sit on the port screen. You've got the 4 factions most games based on WW2 have; Britain, Germany, Japan and America. Along with two more possibly to be factions- France and China.\n\nYou'll go into your first game as a tier one, do a few matches and get to tier two. This is where things start to define who you are and what you want to be in this game.\nFor Japan and America you can choose to go down all lines - Cruiser, Battleship, Aircraft Carrier, Submarine or Destroyer. For UK - Destoryer, Battleship and Aircraft carrier.\nFor Germany - Crusier, Submarine and Battleship.\n\nChoosing what to do here will determine what you do for quite some time or to the tier you want to get to. Playing this with friends is definelty a must have, however "thanks" to the devs, the party size is now a maximum of 3 - used to be 5. But you can still have more than enough fun with 2 of your mates.\n\nAs there is with all F2P games, there is a premium currency. Gold. Gold can be gained several ways, ranging from winning 5v5 battles and being on the leaderboard to buying it. So it isn't just money used to get it. Along with that, the game gives users V.I.P battles, which gains bonus XP (Both Global and ship based) and Silver (Ingame currency).\n\nEach faction has their own strengths and weaknesses. Germans have good accuracy while dealing lower damage. Japan are the tanks of the ocean while America is the all-rounder. Britain has the best sonar and great AA defence.\n\nAfter a while, you'll notice that the game isn't perfect however. There are bugs here and there. Matchmaking issues in higher tiers where few dare to venture. Then you have the censorship which censors words like system. Although some sound game breaking, they really aren't. When players get to higher tiers, there goes the problem of bad balance in late tier games. Every game has their problems and none are perfect. And this game isn't an exception.\n\nA very good sign of a game like this is, although 1 year old in the Chinese market, the developers are active and from what has been said in many of the disucssion threads has been carefully and sufficiently thought out and replied to via their community officials.\n\nThe game itself rewards players who are loyal -with regular login rewards- and those who play a battle correctly. It punishes those who make the wrong decision, however there are tutorials to start new players off.\n\nFinally the graphics of the game; they're not what you'd call amazing but they run well and the gameplay is more than worth having a slightly less 'pretty' game.\n\nTL:DR;\nWW2 factions, which are good at things and have boats. Team up with 3 people and wreck stuff! F2P game, so expect there to be premium vehicles such as the Tirpitz (Worth around $70). Game isn't perfect but hey, who/what is? Has active devs who care about the game but don't know how to promote the product so low playerbase... Rewarding game for players and harsh for stupidity. Ok graphics.

Includes submarines, went about as well as I expected.\nPretty much it's NavyField in 3D. If you like that, then you will probably enjoy this. If you have a 4gb graphics card, then you can expect to get 50FPS on certain maps and 5 on others. Needs a huge amount of optimising.\nIn addition, Aircraft Carriers are horribly balanced. They get shot down in half a second, their bombs do very little damage, and there are EXTREMELY limited controls for them. There is no grouping options, carriers have very delicate planes, to some of you this seems like heaven because they can't do anything, but to others this is a horrific balance. Essentially AA is WAY too effective, a single destroyer can swat off a squad of 9 dive bombers, and take no damage. Cruisers, Carriers, Battleships, good luck. You are going to need it. Tier 2s will obliterate entire waves in seconds, a group of people and you might as well just rush in and try to use main batteries.\nSubmarines are also unbalanced. The only thing in the game capable of hurting them is a Destroyer, which have god awful guns. The range of their torpedoes are long enough where they don't have to be in the front lines, they can sit in the back while the other team is totally helpless to do ANYTHING to stop them.\nThere are no servers for people other than North America. I live in NA, so the ping wouldn't be an issue... Right? Nah, 300+ ping spikes every few seconds. Internet isn't the issue here, friend is having it as well. Lots of people complaining about it in game.\nCommunity is bad, people TK each other constantly with Torpedoes, whether they wanted to or if they are just totally brain dead I don't know, but every game there are 6+ blue people(People who have consistently team killed). Teams themselves are either a winning team or a losing team, there are no close battles. Chat is worse, languages you can't understand because the people have nowhere to go, again because of the servers.\nThere is a pay to win system in place. Gold ammo, does more damage and more penetration, costs ONLY gold(You buy this with money ONLY.) UI is confusing, new players don't understand mechanics. Tutorial explains very little, doesn't explain that there is no such thing as a friendly torpedo. Doesn't ever explain the actual ship UI.\nHonestly, game has potential. But it's laggy in terms of FPS, laggy in terms of Ping, has no servers for anyone outside NA, haven't seen any moderation at all, Pay to Win already in place, Balance issues galore... It needs a lot of work. Til then, just wait and watch. Or play, it is a Free to play* game.\n\n*unless you want to do more damage and penetration.","November 15, 2015","false","4.4"," 10 of 17 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","10","17","0","0"

If you like warship combat it's worth a try.  It's free afterall.  There's a good bit of variety in equipment and graphical skins/flags  for ships which offers some nice customization options.  I'll definitely be playing more of it, so thumbs up!\n\nGoing into the game I didn't expect too much.  I've watched some videos of the chinese version online.  I've played a decent amount of World of Warships (WoWs) and I really enjoy that game.  So that was the bar this game had to cross.\n\nGraphics:\n\nMy first impression was that the graphics are slightly lower quality than WoWs.  The ship models aren't quite as good, but they do the job.  I think mainly the missing thing are post processing shaders.  In game one thing I noticed is that the damage models are somewhat more detailed.  When something gets blown up or damaged, the visual change is more pronounced.  It's not just fire and burned looks, the models show damanged, bent guns, burnt smokestacks, etc.\n\nShips can also be customized with various camo patters and flags.  They can be purcahsed temporarily (7 or 30 days) for a small amount of in game currency or permanently for some premium currency.  This is also a nice addition and helps the ships not all look the same.\n\nGameplay:\n\nThe game starts you in a tutorial, and it's pretty well done.  It does a good job of covering the basics for people who've never played a game in this genre before.  There's a few differences from WoWs, but if you've played it before, then Steel Ocean won't be too surprising.\n\nSteel Ocean is a decent warship game.  The ships are a bit more arcade-like in their movement and feel a little less like a simulation, but not too much.  An hour or so in and it feels natural.  The aiming mechanic is good.  The reticles closing in as the guns line up gives you a good idea of when they're ready and you can fire early if you want to take a chance on the RNG messing you up wiht wide dispersion.\n\nI haven't quite figured out the damage model yet, but cruisers have a tough time with Battleships - their armor is effective and they can tank quite a bit.\n\nEarly on everyone is in a destroyer - so expect torpedos everywhere.  That calms down a bit as people start branching into diffent ships, but torpedos definitely play a larger role in Steel Ocean than World of Warships.  You also have direct control over secondary weapons which is a nice change from WoWs.\n\nSubmarines are part of the game and can't be shot while submerged.  They can only stay under for a short time.  I haven't played one yet, but it seems they only have torpedos, so if you keep range you should be able to dodge them.  Some ships are equipped with depth charges to deal with them while they're underwater.\n\nThe default control scheme is more geared to controlling a person than a ship.  W and A control forward and back movement, but you have to hold them to continue to move forward.  R and F are the default keys for cruise control.  I would immediately rebind those to W and A as you really want to be moving most of the time and not have to hold the key down.\n\nAnother thing to pay attention to is that the guns can be set to fire all at once (salvo) or fire in single shot.  By default this is controlled by the ` key.  When you start a match the weapons will be set to salvo.  I would immediately change that to single shot, so you can use the method of firing one shot at an enemy to see where it goes before commiting all your weapons to what might be a badly aimed shot and then waiting to reload.\n\nOne immediate difference from WoWs is there are a lot of equipment options for ships.  For a variety of costs you can equip various bits of equipment like fire extinguishers, range enhancers, repair kits, to the ship.  This means that not every ship you see of the same class will be identical.  The customization aspect is a welcome addition!\n\nThere's also a good variety of ships.  The US, Japanese and German lines are well fleshed out.  The French and Chinese are mostly place holders with single premium ships for now.\n\nOverall I think this is a welcome addition to the wargame genre.  Early on it's a little rough with so many torpedos, but once you get past the first tier of ships the game really opens up.","November 12, 2015","true","41.5"," 29 of 55 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","29","55","0","0"

And the arcade nature of this game really works. Just don't expect simulation experience. Even the graphics are not terrible, just not as detailed as some other games. Some ships actually look very good (eg. you don't need much details for a sub). Moreover, addition of historical events is also worth praising.\n\nSaying that, I can't recommend this game. You can endure long waiting times, but the amount of friendly fire is just crazy (mostly in the form of torpedoes). No one cares where they launch their torps and believe me, the number of torps in this game is very high. So be prepared that you will be damaged by your own team members almost as much as enemies.","June 2","false","62.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Because frankly, I never played those.\n\nBut I will say, Steel Ocean is fun and enjoyable. It's something I didn't expect to find in a F2P title.\n\nThere is content and playstyles for all types of gamers. If you are a rambo charging, goldfish attention span, CoD style player, you can take a destroyer or cruiser and blast things to your hearts content. You'll likely die a lot but then you normally have pretty low K/D ratios anyways.\n\nIf you are a more strategic player but you like to mix it up some, you'll love taking out a Battleship and just setting up shop on a map then grinning sadistically as your shells decimate attack routes. Then when things get in close, switching to your secondary cannons and making them regret ever approaching you.\n\nTactical player? Take a sub and decimate your foes from beneth the waves. Until you miss a torpedo and one comes in close enough to depth charge you.\n\nReal strategic RTS player? Take a carrier out. Micro manage your fighter wings from behind the lines. Send bombers, fighters, and scouts up.\n\nThis game really has things for many types of gamers. Granted some are better than others. Which makes it hard to rate this game since it is more like an MMO and changes/balances all the time. Right now Carriers are a little weak. That doesn't mean you can't use them. Just gotta be even smarter with them.\n\nThe only major knocks I give this game are the fact you can't choose the gametypes to play. It's all randomized. Then the tutorials are a bit deceptive. Some of them are good, others seem to get you to spend coins or things that you earn that you might not want to spend. Granted they aren't gold coins which cost money but if you don't feel like spending something yet, you don't want a tutorial doing it for you. Keep in mind, esc button works to get out of this.\n\nThere is only one major knock that could be game ending for some. That is literally this game is highly populated in the lower tier ships but very sparse after you hit tier 5. You want to hang onto Tier IV and III vessels if you want populated games.\n\nThat all said, check it out, great time to be had and you don't have to spend a penny on it.","December 5, 2015","true","199.5"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

Matchmaker works great so far. Ship classes are 100% mirrored in 9/10 games. In 1/10 games one team has another cruiser instead of a battleship but things like Submarines or Carriers are always 1:1\n\n-SUBMARINES ! They are well implemented. Of course they can dive but they just have a limited time under water since oxygen runs low pretty fast. There are 2 levels: 1st stage they use less oxygen, can fire torpedos themselves but get hit by torps as well. 2nd stage they can't shoot torps and neither get hit by them, only by water bombs (deep cahrges).\nSubmarine players really have to be patient and carefully. If you meet a Destroyer u're dead.\n\n-Torpedos: NO AIM INDICATOR ! =WIN. Aiming torps needs practice. You have to judge the targets speed, have to split ur torps so that some will hit if target changes speed/direction and you need to get pretty close. Torp shots at ranges over 1km will probably not hit if the target recognises them.\n\n-BUT !: Torpedos have a range minimum. If yo get to close and shoot ur torps they won't detonate.\nIt's a brilliant idea. Torps do massive damage but also require some skill and sometimes even pure luck to hit.\n\n-CVs. AWESOME ! They are still strong but it's no OP killfarming machine anymore. Minimum Torp Range applies on torp bombers as well so there is a chance to evade if u pay attention. Also aiming your torpedo salvos is a bit harder then in WoW.\n\n-AA. AA works great. CVs can't just roll their bombers into groups of ships and get away with this. AA kills planes pretty fast. Even faster when players decide to control their AA manually ! Even strikes on single ships with good AA have to be quick. Planes can't circle around ships for minutes while looking for the right anlge to place their torps. If they get into AA range they bein to die.\n\n-Rock, Paper, Scissors. The ship classes are very well balanced. Threre is no one OP ship that can kill everything. Lone wolves won't survive long as well. You really have to play with your team. Every ship has a counterpart. For example:\n-BBs are very effective against cruisers but can't do anything against a submerged submarine (they can't even see it without sonar)\n-Destroyers are very strong against submarines and battleships if they manage to get close enough for torpedos.\n-Cruisers are strong against DDs  ....\n\nA lot of people don't seem to understand that by now. See a lot of cruisers and DDs rushing forward alone and get instand killed within seconds. While DDs can still try to dodge, cruisers usally are toast when they rush forward, get detected and bombarded by BBs. Doesn't mean that cruisers are weak or BBs OP, they are often just played wrong.\nYou really have to wrok together, know your role within the fleet and have to support each other. If DDs for example rush forward and leave their BBs behind and a hostile submarine manages to slip trough your lines and reaches the BBs it's not the fault of the BBs that they get killed (at least not only), the DDs were supposed to prevent that ;)\n\nAll in all the game is very well thought through and if u like naval games definitely worth a try.","December 17, 2015","true","141.5"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","5","8","0","0"

The gameplay is very team focused which I really like, so it can get frustrating when your PuGs are ignorant and just doing their own thing, but that is pretty standard fare in any online multiplayer game.\n\nEvery day I'm still learning something new! You don't really realize it when you first start playing (admittedly, this is partly due to the fact that a lot of the more intricate things are not explained well, or at all) but the crew system, the spotting and assist system, the damage system...everything is actually pretty complex, well thought out,  and balanced properly. The simple fact that there are Subs available is what made me first try this over World of Warships, and I really have no desire to try World of Warships anymore now that I have experienced SO - I wouldn't really want the game play much slower, losing manual control of my secondary weapons systems, the crew system intricacies, etc. And I say that as somebody who intended to play Subs but has become more comfortable in a Destroyer and Cruiser role and have left Subs by the wayside (though they are excellent and highly recommended to those "stealthy" players).\n\nAs I said, I've slowly gravitated towards and become pretty comfortable playing my role as a Destroyer and sometimes a Cruiser (working up the American line), though it took some time and I certainly still make mistakes. It finally clicked after the first week or so that I really need to concentrate more on scouting instead of trying to be some kind of one-man DPS. Now that I understand more about how the Hiding Factor works and the scouting complexities (disguise, penalties, etc.), I've come to realize that I can gain just as much EXP helping out my team vs. being a lone gunman. That in itself is satisfying, knowing that if played right - or wrong, heh - I can be a critical factor to the success or failure of my team. Though it certainly still takes a group effort to ensure success; every ship has a role, and once you learn and become comfortable in that role, things just start to fall into place.\n\nMy main complaints after 70+ hours would be some performance issues, mainly mediocre FPS even on mid-range+ PCs (30 - 60 fps for me with an i5 4690k @ 4.4GHz and a Radeon 7870Ghz, with 16gb DDR3), followed by slightly high Matchmaker queue times (30s to 3m on avg. for me in a DD or CL/CA) which seems to be a result/combination of population, premade groups, and an apparent desire for many players to mostly play BBs. The great majority of these issues could be fixed with an influx of new players, but it will require a little bit of advertising and marketing on behalf of the publishers/developers. It would certainly be worth their time to do so, as the game itself is very good. So, please devs, don't let your game sink to the competition because you do have something special here.\n\nSee y'all in game!\n\n"Oh no! Torpedo incoming...!"","May 5","true","218.7"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","9","16","0","0"

I wanted warships, not speed boats.\nThis game is a thousand times quicker than Warships is. Like seriously, I was entering combat and almost teamkilled by a ♥♥♥♥♥ who came up from behind me before you would even be able to fire torpedoes at your ally in WoWS. He left me on 5% of my health with everything red and I was ♥♥♥♥♥♥.\nNow, that's my huge gripe already. Torps are worse in this than Warships, and basically everyone can enter combat and before you know it, there's about 60 of them crossing the water each way. The way it plays is much different to Warships straight up, and I know, I only played one match and the tutorial, I probably don't have much credit to my review.\nNow, the controls. Straight up it tells you, WASD to move. R and F for that lovely steady speed, kept at 25/50/75/100% speed, and Q and E (I think) for that stable turning so you can concentrate on the fight. R and F? Not what I liked. I'm used to that being my main movement, and so quickly, W and S became trash keys for me. It only told me this, after the tutorial and in my first fight. While I'm on it, the tutorial is 2 missions that basically say, kill these, and we'll tell you that you have limited communication range but who the hell cares what the range is, we don't. The rest of the missions were just gone for the time being and I was left stunned, coz, hey, TUTORIAL, TEACH ME YOUR GAME FULLY DAMMIT\nOkay, the research tree in this is much MUCH more complex than in WoWS, but it's still the same thing really. One thing that really upset me though, after my first fight. Guess who had to pay for repairs?\nTeamkilled me.\nBasically, TLDR though on gameplay\nIt's much more fast paced, the maps are clearly smaller, and basically, it's an action packed game. I'm not a fan of this, but I do understand why people would love this, and why there's a bunch of positive reviews, and why people say "It's not World of Warships dammit" but it's just WoWS with 200% speed boost and extra content.\nIt's a free game though, so feel free to try it. This is just, not the pace you play Warships at, even if you're a Destroyer.\n1/10 for a dozen "ENEMY TORPEDOES APPROACHING" warnings at the start of match. Yeah, sorry destroyers, you can't be sneaky about your main game tactic.","November 24, 2015","false","0.6"," 40 of 77 people (52%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","52","40","77","5","4"

Submarines are quite fun because u can either sneak support your team or go off on your own in solo play and wreck some battleships/cruisers/carriers. Destroyers...FU in a sub lol are great at being a scout and finishing off targets and torping everything and anything that moves including teammates lol.\nAbout cost\nHonestly u don't need to even spend money on the game unless you want a special ship.I've spent 10 dollars on gold currency the entire time i've played, also bought the packages because i wanted the stuff from them and support the game.\nI've had no crashes and it runs great get a better computer you whiners that say "i'm uninstalling as i speak".\nLots of ships to pick from also, although some people like to team kill but i haven't found alot other then getting torped by my own team because people think they can shoot through teammates.

And the tech tree I found are very limited only the US and Japanese have a full tree the germans have everything minus the Carriers, the French and Chinese are there but there limited with only one ship which you half to buy with real money. I also found that the torpedos on a few of the tier 1s had a longer range than the guns and the tutorial for the game never really went over in great detail how to aim the torpedos, then with the guns there is an amming circle on the water that gets smaller depending on how your turning and I also got voice notifications saying "If you stop your ship you will aim better".","November 13, 2015","false","1.1"," 25 of 48 people (52%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","52","25","48","2","3"

With Steel Ocean, it is definitely the best game out there that could call itself a sequel, or an improvement, to NF.\n\nI had the chance to test NF2, which is horrible, don't even try to talk about that game. I also was holding great hopes for WoWs by Wargaming, but finally, the game doesn't really align to what I am looking for.\n\nThe game is quite a big composition of different elements inspired from various games (NF, WoT, WoWs, Battlestation) and the result is a success, in my opinion.\n\nThere was this issue in NF that the BB class was clearly OP (over-powered) and you could actually win the game quite easly just by being a skilled BB captain, the game seems far better balanced here. Especially looking at the role of DDs and CLs/CAs, which where pretty useless in NF (except for AA and anti Sub, when subs where a threat, which wasn't a huge problem most of the time).\n\nYes, it's a F2P, and yes, if you pay you're going to have a better ship and all then a non premium player with less play time. But I feel that you don't need much to enjoy the game. As long as you use your head, which often allows you to maximize them profits by taking good decisions, and don't wast your money on non-essential features, you can allow yourself a painless grind and enjoy playing longer in your beloved ships by not gaining too much experience (if you're not using premium).\n\nAll in all, I recommend the game, it's free, you should take a look and see for yourself.","February 11","true","255.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

When I came back to it a few years later, the community had dried up and you could no longer reliably get into a full game.\n\nNavyField 2 dropped one day and I was ecstatic - this was the game we'd been promised for years.  Unfortunately, NavyField 2 failed to deliver.  I could write a whole negative review on NavyField 2, but trust me, it wasn't worth the hours I put into it, and judging by the experience of high-tier players, it wasn't worth their time either.\n\nSteel Ocean is the game that NavyField 2 should have been - third person instead of isometric view, more emphasis on teamplay, giving Destroyers and Cruisers roles beyond "rush the enemy, drop torpedoes, run, repeat", USABLE ANTI-AIRCRAFT GUNS, ship trees that make sense and steadily improve rather than getting worse in the middle tiers to force buying gold to make free exp with lower tiered ships, far less powerful microtransactions, far better graphical effects, more dynamic submarine play, and developers who actually work on improving the game instead of just talking about it.\n\nIt's not a perfect naval sim for the reasons others have noted - you tend to spend a lot of time just positioning and looking for something to fight, so games have a slow feel.  It's not a fast-paced FPS MOBA by any means.  At times it feels like turn-based strategy - I just shot, now my opponent gets to shoot, now I shoot back, eventually one of us dies.  Playing Destroyer or Cruiser is rewarding unless you get volleyed in the face before you can actually do anything.  Battleships are rewarding unless you get torpedoed in the back before you can actually do anything.  So combat sometimes takes a long time to happen, and when it does happen, it tends to be over really quickly.\n\nHaving said that, this is an excellent free-to-play MOBA with a very good tutorial and I'd highly recommend dumping at least a few hours into it.","December 5, 2015","true","5.3"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

I still don't suggest this game to anyone.\n\nThe game so far is also messed up beyond all recognition when it comes to balance. In fact, it is no better than War Thunder. It is important to mention that the balance might even worse than Navyfield or World of Tanks.\n\nThe best example would be late tier Destroyer's shell outdamage to an extant some heavy cruisers and CL in this game within a gap of 1-2 Tier. Their DPM is on par with those heavy cruisers (German vs IJN DD)\n\nThe physic of this game makes a certain class completely obsolete; such as heavy cruisers.\n\nThe physic of this game gives an incredible advantage to the following class: Destroyers and CV. Here's an explanation as to why they do so.\nCV: The current physic allows torpedo bombers to turn 90degree nearly in an instant, which is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and basically it's a big middle finger to whoever try to dodge them.BB's, CA, and couple of CL are just food to them. Because of this, dodging is almost irrevelant against half decent CV player. The only ship class that may be able to evade them are usually the DD.\n\nDD: The current hitbox, speed, agility, health pool allows one ship to YOLO scout in the firing range of the whole team and be able to get away. DD's survivability is insanely high. Even a BB doesn't have such equivalent. Further, it doesn't require much skill to get close in the 1-2km to a BB to torp them, and is easier if you buy the cheap smoke.\nTheir late tier torpedos are just a joke seriously, it takes 2-3 torps to sink most ship in the game such is the case of the Japanese (Here's where they apply nation trait in a brainless manner that just FUBAR the games).\nBecause of the current physic, this game should just rename to "DD Ocean", it's far more easier to play them, it's also far more easier to win with them, it outclass CL/CA (explanation later)\n\n\nClass that are at disadvantage because of the physics are the CL and CA:\nCA: If you're going to think CA excel at killing DD/CL/CA, then you are dead wrong. The long aiming  time, longer shell's hangtime makes it basically an innapropriate class for killing DD. To make it short, if you want to hunt DDs, you better take another DD or some overpowered CL.\n\nCL: While they are enjoyable to play, they are certainly not competitive. Their bigger hitbox and inferior camo value makes it worse than DD scouting. Fact is, couple of CL are interesting to play and few of them are overpowered in an extant: these ships are certainly like the Atlanta for brawling CA and BB, Kberg 1927 for having no flaw, agano for having the turning force of a DD which makes it fun to dodge shells.\n\nI don't care if you're going to say realism, this is a game, not a real life. If I want better realism, I would hop on silent hunter 3/4 with better mods.\n\nEdit 3: Jan 5 2016\nAfter contacting the technical support, it has been reveal that there will be no rebalancing session whatsoever. Basically, it's a middlefinger when it comes to the balance. Therefore, your overpowered ship or really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ poor performance ship won't likely to be fixed anytime soon. The staff of this game claimed to do their best to work on the game content thorugh reading reviews on the steam forum.\nI mean, who in the right mind will actually spend their time analyzing it. After all, most legit complaint about broken content will likely be flamed fest by trolls in this game.\nTherefore, if balance is a priority for you,  you might reconsider playing this game, if you think it's OPship free.","December 6, 2015","false","463.0"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

THIS GAME IS UNSTABLE AND BROKEN.\n\nI am a long time Navy Field player and this game does seem and have a feel similar to that game, but its clearly a clone of World of Tanks and World of Warships.\n\nI will give the dev one thing, I appreciate them releasing the German KM, RN and Japanese lines first as opposed to Wargaming.nets model in which they clearly are milking you and keeping you waiting while pushing and making up Russian overpowered ships and tanks.\n\nThis game plays okay, more fast paced and arcady than the competitor.  What it does have is a very good sound track, graphics are not the best and this isn't a naval sim game or very strategic/tactical.   The translations are horrible and unless I learn to read Chinese I can't even understand the in-game mail I got.\n\nThe biggest detractor is this game is NOT STABLE.  Right out of a fresh install I get repeated disconnects from the server, often multiple disconnects per match.  This makes the game pretty much unplayable for me and a grind impossible when you DC almost every match for doing simple functions.\n\nAnother major detractor is because this game is free and arcady it has a very immature community.  Expect childish conversations, very little teamwork, plenty of TKing going on.  If you enjoy elementary school discussions then this is the place for you.  Otherwise to the old school/casual gamers who loved games like Great Naval Battles or Navy Field.  You'll get a bit of a nostalgia and something different from the Russian-bias MMORPG games, but that's it.  Nothing here is really innovative or ground breaking.\n\nSUMMARY:\nPros:\n- Bigger RN, IJN, KM and US naval trees instead of the Russian made-up/OP stuff\n- Not Wargaming or Gaijin based\n- Fast paced action\n- Similar to other MMORPG's so its relatively easy to get into\n- Better camos\n\nCons:\n- Horrible Disconnects, even multiple disconnects for simple functions\n- Outdated graphics\n- Arcady action\n- Terrible translations\n- Very immature community that is small\n- High amount of TK's","December 11, 2015","false","9.4"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","2"

Follows the War Thunder/World of Tanks etc. model , however there is one huge thing that sets it apart from the crowd: variety.\n\nYes, the biggest thing I love about this game is that it has a huge amount of gameplay variety compared to some of these other games.\n\n-Destroyers (my favorite) are fast, agile, and are deadly at close range with depth charges to destroy submarines and torpedoes to take out carriers and battleships. Now, eventually the subs get smart and realize that if they surface they can avoid your depth charges and are almost too small to hit with your main guns. BUT what they don't seem to have caught on to yet, is that you can actually ram any ship smaller than you and it typically results in an instant kill, so if an enemy sub surfaces to try to escape the depth charges just smash into them.\n\n-Cruisers are essentially larger destroyers- more health, and bigger guns. They are maneuverable enough to dodge torpedoes and are quite effective against Destroyers. Light Cruisers have depth charges, making them alright against subs, and Heavy Cruisers have main batteries making them able to punch through the armor of Battleships at long range.\n\n-Battleships are the big guns, able to deal ridiculous amounts of damage at very long range. They are good at destroying pretty much any ship except Submarines and Destroyers which are small enough to practically ignore their volleys. Their major drawback is that they require Carriers, Destroyers, or Submarines to scout for them so that they can stay back and deal damage without getting into torpedo range.\n\n-Submarines are the stealth hunters. They can submerge under water and become immune to most attacks, at the cost of speed and limited oxygen supply. Going just below the surface allows them to fire (and be struck by) torpedoes while avoiding cannon fire, and diving deeper makes them safe from everything except depth charges. Because they are slow while underwater and vulnerable to depth charges, they are very vulnerable to Destroyers, but extremely strong against Battleships and Carriers which basically cannot hurt them.\n\n-Carriers are the odd ones out that don't really fall into the Rocks Paper Scissors circle. They can send scout planes all over the map, making them excellent for recon, and can harass ships with dive bombers, destroy enemy planes with fighters, and even take out subs with torpedo bombers. However, planes can be shot down fairly easy if the victim is paying attention, so they are most effective at taking out ships already engaged in combat.\n\nWhat ends up happening in most matches is, the Battleships and Carriers sit back, while the Destroyers, Subs, and Cruisers usually charge in. Carriers are ironically the first to the front lines with their planes. Because Battleships are the most powerful in terms of dealing damage, the trick is to scout out the position of the enemy Battleships so that your Battleships can destroy the enemy's while yours stay hidden. Alternatively, if your Submarines can sneak past the enemy Destroyers, they can easily destroy their Battleships and Carriers as well.\n\nOr if you like to yolo it up like me, you can just play a Destroyer and charge straight at the enemy Battleship. If you're still in one piece by the time you get close, you're going to be getting a lot of kills.\n\nThis variety makes every ship play totally differently, you really feel like you are important to your team as everyone has their own role to play. It's free and worth your time.","November 17, 2015","true","59.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Yes, the carriers are not balanced and you end up at lower levels becoming very frustrated. Hard to target with torpedo bombers and the enemy can shot down your aircraft very easy.  Fun if you are shooting at them though.  Problem is few people play carriers since they are so frustrating, so often you do not have a chance to shoot planes down.  The shooting is not assited like WoW, so hitting an enemy is more difficult except on aircraft.  However, the  manual aiming is something you may come to like as you play, since it demands more skill on your part.\n\nMost serious issue?  Team Killers. Since this game is open to the entire global community communications are hindered, and there is no penaly system to discourage TKers.  They just run around torpedoing freindlys due to their sloppy game style and lack of concern.  THIS GAME NEEDS A TK PENALTY SYSTEM.  Temporary player bans for excessive TKs would be helpful.\n\nNice Features:  Several nice features, but one big one is in game verification windows to check for BOTS.  In game a captcha window often appears demanding you respond in so many seconds. Very nice security feature.\n\nCurrently most players are playing as destroyers, battleships, and submarines.  May alter as more high tiers develop, but currently you will see a sea full of submarines when you enter a game.","November 29, 2015","true","159.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Have you done any research? The ships are all within 2 knots of their actual speeds in the game, some are actually slower than their real life variants. Flanking was possible in naval warfare, the issue was that on open ocean- where most naval battles happened- you would have at least 5 miles of sight at any given time, making it extremely difficult to flank- but most of the flanks happening in this game occur on the island maps where people can duck out of your los with the small numerous islands.\nAs for an actual review to this game each ship plays so differently that I dont think 1 blanket statement would cover it so:\n\nAircraft carriers- A sort of crappy rts rip copy. That is not to say it isnt fun, it has to be my favorite ship class as a matter of fact, why? Because I love the RTS genre of course- it is also equipped with the best AA equipment.\n\nSubmarines- I don't believe I am the right person to be writing this portion but whatever: the submarines in this game operate in a nice way- if I had to say honestly its either them or aircraft carriers that have the highest skill cap- the submarines have to pay attention to a handful of things when they play more so than other ships- depth, oxygen, where enemies were last seen, distance from enemies, speed/oxygen/distance, when best to surface- probably the most engaging submarine play I have ever used in a game before\n\nBattleships- ah yes WW2 the age of the battleship (technically the dawn of the aircraft carrier but whatever) this is the ship I first planned to use and with much good luck, you aim your guns safely from behind a wall of friendlies while they/scout planes figure out enemy locations. Then you lead your target and wait as the coi(cone of impact) slowly shrinks down to an acceptable size, after firing you see your rounds fly beautifully through the air to the idiot that dare expose himself to your cannons! Nearly everything hits heavily crippling the enemy/ killing them.\n\nDestroyers + Light cruisers- these two play very similarly in my experience though honestly I havent play much of these, they rely heavily on torpedoes- have decent AA - and amongst other things can almost never be killed by the submarines- see speed and size - these two ships seem heavily reaction and observation based, if carriers and submarines are brains- destroyers and light cruisers are brawns(how fast and accurately can you react) for even a second late and that submarine we were just talking about has sunk you, not only that but you've brought shame to your fellow destroyers and cruisers >:(\n\nHeavy Cruisers + Anything else I mightve missed- I haven't played these ships types, I fell in love with aircraft carriers and just stopped every other research tree\n(lastly for all those claiming this is a copy of WoWs, no development for this would've had to been started before its announcement. In terms of UI and gameplay this is more similar to armored warfare. Lastly-lastly this game seems better balanced than wows as well as the torpedoes actually have an arming distance. Lastly-lastly-lastly this game is more realistic then wows.)","November 20, 2015","true","31.9"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","3","6","2","1"

They can only go underwater for a few minutes, 2 to 5 so far, and can also be damaged by torpedos. Unless they run deep, then they can only last underwater half as long. They have to spend equal time on the surface to recharge their air. Destroyers also wreck them since they are fast torpedo boats with good sonar.\n\nIt follows the normal method of world of tanks and games like it, with consumables, equipment, and upgrades. The upgrades often help out but are not make or break.\n\nThe torpedoes are faster than world of warships. They go about 60 km/h here and ships go about 10-35 km/h. There is no indicator telling you what angle you should be firing your torpedoes. The ships here also turn rather fast and can stop a lot faster than world of warships.\n\nCarriers don't seem as strong since there is automatic AA and manual AA in this game. The machine guns will automatically shoot planes down slowly while the flak cannons can drastically improve this. You also get a lead icon if the planes get close enough. They enter a birds eye view mode to control the planes and often miss smaller ships getting near them. The bad part about the birds eye view is that you can't easily move the map around without scrolling to the edges of it or clicking on the minimap. WASD still controls your ship in birds eye view mode.\n\nBattleships are more like artillery and can enter birds eye view to fire from long distances. They often won't see a faster ship sneak up on them to blow them up.\n\nLight cruisers and Heavy cruisers are a good jack of all trade fit between destroyers and battleships.\n\nMost of the english in this game is good, except for a few things on the friends list. And the game is full of asian game type log in rewards or do ♥♥♥♥ rewards.\n\nThe game does have gold rounds, but they are not very strong. The torpedoes are laughable, since they go 10% faster and do 1 more damage (like 650 to 651).\n\nThe gold rate is about $1 for 500 gold, with 6 one time buy packages that double your rate.\n\nIt has two vip modes. One is about 9 bucks or less per month for +50% more silver and exp. The other is a per game rate of 50 gold per match for +100% more silver and exp. That is 10 cents a pop and with a package is 5 cents.\n\nWithout VIP, the grind to tier 3 has been about 6 hours which is not that bad compared to some other games. I don't know how bad it will get.\n\nIt has a growth program that if you buy in before tier 5, you will get rewards for getting a tier 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 ship. You will get about double the gold that you put in back and a lot of free experience, almost enough for researching a tier 9 ship.\n\nThere is a commander system in the game where you level up commanders to improve their predefined skills or gain access to new skills, or have to buy random commanders and merge two of the same to rank them up and get access to other predefined skills.\n\nOver all, it is a rather decent boat game as long as you don't mind ships moving rather slowly and are ok with some arcade action in your boat game. There is even a rare first to 17 kill mode where you can respawn.\n\n","November 12, 2015","true","304.9"," 37 of 74 people (50%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","50","37","74","3","0"

Personally though I would prefer a game that was more simulator like than both WOWs and SO.","December 10, 2015","true","17.5"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","1"

They are a lot of fun to play.\nThey have a fleshed out German Navy tech tree already.\nThey have already added a CV and DD line of Royal Navy ships to the game (with the latest patch).\nThe Commander system provides an interesting bit of customisation beyond unlocking identical skills for every ship like in WOWS.\nCVs don't seem as poweful, you can still get kills with your planes but it's more challenging, though you get complete freedom to launch whatever planes you want which is a nice bonus, no limits to one or two loadouts.\nBeing able to fire my own AA guns and Secondary batteries separately from my main batteries, a massive bonus on BBs.\n\nThere are a wide variety of maps, a number of different game types including deathmatch style Competition mode and a massive array of ships to collect. Considering the game has only been out for a month I am very opptimistic about the future and look forward to seeing what will come.\n\nThe only downside to me at the moment is the fact I have to play on a NA server meaning the lag is a bit annoying but even so the game is still playable enough and I've not had any major connection issues.\n\nThis game is fun, try it out, it's free.","December 11, 2015","true","194.4"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

They can only go underwater for a few minutes, 2 to 5 so far, and can also be damaged by torpedos. Unless they run deep, then they can only last underwater half as long. They have to spend equal time on the surface to recharge their air. Destroyers also wreck them since they are fast torpedo boats with good sonar.\n\nIt follows the normal method of world of tanks and games like it, with consumables, equipment, and upgrades. The upgrades often help out but are not make or break.\n\nThe torpedoes are faster than world of warships. They go about 60 km/h here and ships go about 10-35 km/h. There is no indicator telling you what angle you should be firing your torpedoes. The ships here also turn rather fast and can stop a lot faster than world of warships.\n\nCarriers don't seem as strong since there is automatic AA and manual AA in this game. The machine guns will automatically shoot planes down slowly while the flak cannons can drastically improve this. You also get a lead icon if the planes get close enough. They enter a birds eye view mode to control the planes and often miss smaller ships getting near them. The bad part about the birds eye view is that you can't easily move the map around without scrolling to the edges of it or clicking on the minimap. WASD still controls your ship in birds eye view mode.\n\nBattleships are more like artillery and can enter birds eye view to fire from long distances. They often won't see a faster ship sneak up on them to blow them up.\n\nLight cruisers and Heavy cruisers are a good jack of all trade fit between destroyers and battleships.\n\nMost of the english in this game is good, except for a few things on the friends list. And the game is full of asian game type log in rewards or do ♥♥♥♥ rewards.\n\nThe game does have gold rounds, but they are not very strong. The torpedoes are laughable, since they go 10% faster and do 1 more damage (like 650 to 651).\n\nThe gold rate is about $1 for 500 gold, with 6 one time buy packages that double your rate.\n\nIt has two vip modes. One is about 9 bucks or less per month for +50% more silver and exp. The other is a per game rate of 50 gold per match for +100% more silver and exp. That is 10 cents a pop and with a package is 5 cents.\n\nWithout VIP, the grind to tier 3 has been about 6 hours which is not that bad compared to some other games. I don't know how bad it will get.\n\nIt has a growth program that if you buy in before tier 5, you will get rewards for getting a tier 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 ship. You will get about double the gold that you put in back and a lot of free experience, almost enough for researching a tier 9 ship.\n\nThere is a commander system in the game where you level up commanders to improve their predefined skills or gain access to new skills, or have to buy random commanders and merge two of the same to rank them up and get access to other predefined skills.\n\nOver all, it is a rather decent boat game as long as you don't mind ships moving rather slowly and are ok with some arcade action in your boat game. There is even a rare first to 17 kill mode where you can respawn.\n\n","November 12, 2015","true","304.9"," 37 of 74 people (50%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","50","37","74","3","0"

Overall I can't give a very good review.  Firstly the game mechanics themselves are very poor.  Ships do not seem to handle very well at all.  The controls are very poor as well.  I don't like having to keep my finger on the "w" key to keep moving forward but many times when I used "r" for setting a fixed forward speed it would get knocked back to manual.  The ships start and stop way too quickly and the actual mechanics for the subs is very weak.  You are basically a ship that can go underwater for 3 minutes at a time.  Everyone can see you, even underwater.  I have read elsewhere the game described as very "arcade-ish" and that is a very good description.  don't play if you are looking for a realistic ship sim.","January 22","false","2.3"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","4"

The community is toxic, teamkilling is rampant and most matches you are almost always being immediately shot at intentionally by someone on your team (teamkillers are blue so no surprise). Don't even bother opening world chat because every over comment is some racist remark being slung out insulting nationalities, religions, ethnic background... you name it.\n\nAlthough there is a lot of chatter on the discussion board about the cheaters I have not been exposed to it in the lower tiers but it is not surprising there is collusion between players of a fleet on opposite sides of a team giving the other a decided advantage.\n\nI was warned about the graphics not being polished and that was a true statement. About the only thing I like is the port UI, I cannot complain about that.\n\nI just don't see this being much more than a "I am really, really, really bored and my option is play this or mow the yard..World of Warships is down for maintenance right now."\n\nDon't believe how toxic and racist this community is?

THIS GAME IS UNSTABLE AND BROKEN.\n\nI am a long time Navy Field player and this game does seem and have a feel similar to that game, but its clearly a clone of World of Tanks and World of Warships.\n\nI will give the dev one thing, I appreciate them releasing the German KM, RN and Japanese lines first as opposed to Wargaming.nets model in which they clearly are milking you and keeping you waiting while pushing and making up Russian overpowered ships and tanks.\n\nThis game plays okay, more fast paced and arcady than the competitor.  What it does have is a very good sound track, graphics are not the best and this isn't a naval sim game or very strategic/tactical.   The translations are horrible and unless I learn to read Chinese I can't even understand the in-game mail I got.\n\nThe biggest detractor is this game is NOT STABLE.  Right out of a fresh install I get repeated disconnects from the server, often multiple disconnects per match.  This makes the game pretty much unplayable for me and a grind impossible when you DC almost every match for doing simple functions.\n\nAnother major detractor is because this game is free and arcady it has a very immature community.  Expect childish conversations, very little teamwork, plenty of TKing going on.  If you enjoy elementary school discussions then this is the place for you.  Otherwise to the old school/casual gamers who loved games like Great Naval Battles or Navy Field.  You'll get a bit of a nostalgia and something different from the Russian-bias MMORPG games, but that's it.  Nothing here is really innovative or ground breaking.\n\nSUMMARY:\nPros:\n- Bigger RN, IJN, KM and US naval trees instead of the Russian made-up/OP stuff\n- Not Wargaming or Gaijin based\n- Fast paced action\n- Similar to other MMORPG's so its relatively easy to get into\n- Better camos\n\nCons:\n- Horrible Disconnects, even multiple disconnects for simple functions\n- Outdated graphics\n- Arcady action\n- Terrible translations\n- Very immature community that is small\n- High amount of TK's","December 11, 2015","false","9.4"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","2"

But this game has more of a WoT feel to it(having to buy ammo/Dammage model). lets start with the Pros of the game ....\n\nPro:\n-as of writing this review this game (seems) to have more ships\n-Progression Seems fairly fast(if you win)\n-movement of the ships feel nice(tough a bit unrealistic acceleration and decelleration)\n-detailed shells (penetration values etc are listed(presumably also taken into account when shooting things i dont know if armor angle and thiner armored parts are modeled))\n-Nice sounding audio\n-Nice amount for detail on the map\n-Theres submarines but theyr fairly well balanced(in my opinion(for those wondering about subs more below))\n-The gameplay seems more enjoyable\n\nCons:\n-Doesnt look that good\n-Messy ship slection menu(in my opinion(stuff is all over the place))  (this might be due to my 4:3 screen)\n-possibly overpriced gold items(assuming the games uses a conversion rate about the same as WoWS /WoT(havent checked))\n-To get Crew you have to Pay gold\n-allot of ships seem to be paperdesigns and/or redesigns of alredy ingame ships\n\nPro/Cons (fall in both categorys);\n-No easy aim torpedos(this is also a con cause you got no clue where to aim so it becomes )\n-No ciritical/Citadel hits\n\nConclusions :\nits more of a WoT clone with somme WoWS stuff mixed in trying to stands its own in the F2P MMO vechiclecombat market. and i can understand it taking idea from other games cause if they work well might as well use them. and to shorten everything in this review to one description it would be: WoT(with somme WoWS mixed in) with warships and subs instead of tanks and arty. i have mixed feeling about this game and im not saying its bad but i dont recomend it either.(i put a Yes as recomendation since i found the game prety enjoyable for the time i played even tough im having a mixed feeling about it)\n\nScores:\nfor those wanting scores id give a this game a 4.5 to 6.5/10(rough estimate cause i  havent played it that much as of writing this) and WoWS a 6.5 to 7/10 as reffrence(keep in mind this is without a scoring system just on gut feeling)\n\nSubMarines:\nfor those wondering about submarines ... heres how they work:\nyou have a oxygen bar that charges while you above watter and depending on the depth(shallow or deep)it will get used up faster.and as the oxygen gets lower you will also start moving slower(i Believe havent realy looked at the speed). you can only fire your deck gun while submerged and only use your torpedoes when in shallow watter or submerged. tough when your submerged your not safe when in "shallow" depth you cans till get hit by depth charges (and i think artierly to rarely) and if you go to "deep" depth you will burn to your oxygen like anything youv ever seen. it also takes somme time to go up/down. when you press the assigned button you will get a WoW Like ability charge bar and as soon as that fils up you will start to raise or lower your depth(this part goes fairly fast tough maby a little to fast). and ontop of this submarines are only detectable via sonar when submerged. that said they seem prety balanced.","November 14, 2015","true","0.8"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

It's like that bag of chips you always get. It's not that great, but you'd just want more.\n\nAnywho, The aiming feels a tad clunky. nothing a few matches won't help you get used to. Gameplay wise, it's similar to World of Warships with more Ships. Light cruisers feels a bit heavy I would say. BB is... well, in WoW. You were this big hunk of hard metal. Slow but relatively hard to kill. In this game, they took all that hard metal away and replaced it with tin. Firepower is still there, but you can go down pretty quick especially from sneaky DDs/SS and CVs which drop torps and dive bombers on you. CVs are more like the same, RTS and all the shenanigans.  SS is what you'd expect and DDs are DDs. Annoying little buggers.\n\nAs for p2w concerns. There are "Premium" Ammo which are a cut above the rest which cost 2 gold(Cash currency) per ammo. Unfortunately, I have no idea how effective these are due to the game being fresh and all. Onwards we can also use cash currency to exchange it to EXP which used for researching upgrades and higher ship tiers and silver.\n\nAlright we got that over with, Should you play Steel Ocean?\n\nCertainly it's worth a try but in it's current state, there are alot of tweaking that needs to be made. if you don't want to go through the hassle, you might wanna steer clear and play World of warship instead.","November 13, 2015","true","18.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

In Wow sitting in a battleship you feel like in a fortress, here you just feel like having huge firepower. Same fire power that sink you if you get a full salvo from another battleship.\nIn SO the ships seem to accelerate and stop way to fast.

World of Warships meets Battlestations Pacific.  Well balanced and defined weaknesses and strenghts of each ship type.  Would be better off if the PR department would get off their ♥♥♥ and start advertising!\n\nPros:\n-Subs (Done to perfection.  Uses a simple depth system with oxygen bar that prevents perminantly being submerged.  No reason WoWS didn't impliment this.)\n-Skill Based Gun and Torp firing system (No target assist)\n-Hard Counters and Well Defined Roles (Battleships are the big mean bully of the playground until they run into a Sub, immediately running with their tails between their legs.)\n-Manual control of all armarments. (Secondaries/AA/Smoke)\n-Spotting system is much more developed and depends on smaller ships and scout planes. (TEAMWORK!)\n-"VIP/Premium" Time for the game has a per-day and per-battle function, for those who donot play often.  Also per-day is pausable by purchasing a per-battle VIP and remains paused untill the per-battle is used up. (This is huge for those who play casually!)\n-Multiple "Commander" roles for one ship (Captain/Gunner/Helmsmen/Radioman/Engineer) that works on all ships without penalty.\n-Awesome Maps that seem more focused on reality and less on MLG "Everything needs to have a tatical purpose or scrap it".\n-NIGHT BATTLES!(Fun!)\n-Less Inertia-dependant ship controls. (Ships seem more reactive and torpedoes less deadly to skilled drivers)\n-Carriers done right. (Planes have fuel.  Planes are weak verses anyone maning their AAA but arn't always visible like in WoWS so they can easily sneak up on people, drop torps, and get out before anyone can shoot them down.)\n\n\nCons:\n-Severe lack of player base at the moment.  Seriously, Steel Ocean, get out there and advertise!  You could mop the floor with WoWS untill they impliment some of your mechanics!\n-Severe lack of higher tier players. (See first con for reasons why)\n-Complicated captains system.\n-No perk system/customizability for captains.\n-Less impressive graphics than World of Warships.\n-Night Battles. (Sub hell)\n-Less Inertia-dependant ship controls. (Seems slightly unnatural when a Battleship goes from 0 to 10knots in 3 seconds, avoiding your torpedoes)\n-The Atlanta's Main DP Armarment isn't considered AAA.\n-Fighters seem to play less of a role in this game, assuming you have people paying attention to planes and swapping to AAA to shoot them down.\n\nI'd give it a 8.5/10.\n\nPS: French sub has 205mm cannons.

It's a sopping wet, ugly turd in a squatting toilet -- so it's at least easily accessible. It's free to reach on in and grab it if you want. I should warn you that there are pay2win corn chunks in it that do offer real advantage for real money.\n\nPositively, there are both sinkers and floaters, and you also get some pretty nice grunts when the turds unleash their fury.\n\nNegatively, this turd has problems in that some of the nuggets should be faster than the others, but they all seem to turn and move at too similar speeds; also, reticles that only close in quickly on enemy turds when you're standing still, so there are a lot of easy turds to hit. The toilet is unoptimized too; again, it's one of those uncomfortable squatting toilets. It might be faster to do your business with one, once your business starts, but the discomfort causes the business to take forever to begin. That might be something time heals, but when you want to splash one down, the last thing you want to do is wait forever.\n\nMythbusters proved that you can, in fact, polish a turd. Unfortunately, in Steel Ocean's case, you'd have to wait a few years before it's petrified into something that could be polished without falling apart.\n\nUltimately, I advise you to flush it and move on. Something with more meat will stink up the room soon enough.","November 13, 2015","false","3.7"," 31 of 62 people (50%) found this review helpful 25 people found this review funny","50","31","62","25","0"

Yes, the carriers are not balanced and you end up at lower levels becoming very frustrated. Hard to target with torpedo bombers and the enemy can shot down your aircraft very easy.  Fun if you are shooting at them though.  Problem is few people play carriers since they are so frustrating, so often you do not have a chance to shoot planes down.  The shooting is not assited like WoW, so hitting an enemy is more difficult except on aircraft.  However, the  manual aiming is something you may come to like as you play, since it demands more skill on your part.\n\nMost serious issue?  Team Killers. Since this game is open to the entire global community communications are hindered, and there is no penaly system to discourage TKers.  They just run around torpedoing freindlys due to their sloppy game style and lack of concern.  THIS GAME NEEDS A TK PENALTY SYSTEM.  Temporary player bans for excessive TKs would be helpful.\n\nNice Features:  Several nice features, but one big one is in game verification windows to check for BOTS.  In game a captcha window often appears demanding you respond in so many seconds. Very nice security feature.\n\nCurrently most players are playing as destroyers, battleships, and submarines.  May alter as more high tiers develop, but currently you will see a sea full of submarines when you enter a game.","November 29, 2015","true","159.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

They can only go underwater for a few minutes, 2 to 5 so far, and can also be damaged by torpedos. Unless they run deep, then they can only last underwater half as long. They have to spend equal time on the surface to recharge their air. Destroyers also wreck them since they are fast torpedo boats with good sonar.\n\nIt follows the normal method of world of tanks and games like it, with consumables, equipment, and upgrades. The upgrades often help out but are not make or break.\n\nThe torpedoes are faster than world of warships. They go about 60 km/h here and ships go about 10-35 km/h. There is no indicator telling you what angle you should be firing your torpedoes. The ships here also turn rather fast and can stop a lot faster than world of warships.\n\nCarriers don't seem as strong since there is automatic AA and manual AA in this game. The machine guns will automatically shoot planes down slowly while the flak cannons can drastically improve this. You also get a lead icon if the planes get close enough. They enter a birds eye view mode to control the planes and often miss smaller ships getting near them. The bad part about the birds eye view is that you can't easily move the map around without scrolling to the edges of it or clicking on the minimap. WASD still controls your ship in birds eye view mode.\n\nBattleships are more like artillery and can enter birds eye view to fire from long distances. They often won't see a faster ship sneak up on them to blow them up.\n\nLight cruisers and Heavy cruisers are a good jack of all trade fit between destroyers and battleships.\n\nMost of the english in this game is good, except for a few things on the friends list. And the game is full of asian game type log in rewards or do ♥♥♥♥ rewards.\n\nThe game does have gold rounds, but they are not very strong. The torpedoes are laughable, since they go 10% faster and do 1 more damage (like 650 to 651).\n\nThe gold rate is about $1 for 500 gold, with 6 one time buy packages that double your rate.\n\nIt has two vip modes. One is about 9 bucks or less per month for +50% more silver and exp. The other is a per game rate of 50 gold per match for +100% more silver and exp. That is 10 cents a pop and with a package is 5 cents.\n\nWithout VIP, the grind to tier 3 has been about 6 hours which is not that bad compared to some other games. I don't know how bad it will get.\n\nIt has a growth program that if you buy in before tier 5, you will get rewards for getting a tier 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 ship. You will get about double the gold that you put in back and a lot of free experience, almost enough for researching a tier 9 ship.\n\nThere is a commander system in the game where you level up commanders to improve their predefined skills or gain access to new skills, or have to buy random commanders and merge two of the same to rank them up and get access to other predefined skills.\n\nOver all, it is a rather decent boat game as long as you don't mind ships moving rather slowly and are ok with some arcade action in your boat game. There is even a rare first to 17 kill mode where you can respawn.\n\n","November 12, 2015","true","304.9"," 37 of 74 people (50%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","50","37","74","3","0"

Have you done any research? The ships are all within 2 knots of their actual speeds in the game, some are actually slower than their real life variants. Flanking was possible in naval warfare, the issue was that on open ocean- where most naval battles happened- you would have at least 5 miles of sight at any given time, making it extremely difficult to flank- but most of the flanks happening in this game occur on the island maps where people can duck out of your los with the small numerous islands.\nAs for an actual review to this game each ship plays so differently that I dont think 1 blanket statement would cover it so:\n\nAircraft carriers- A sort of crappy rts rip copy. That is not to say it isnt fun, it has to be my favorite ship class as a matter of fact, why? Because I love the RTS genre of course- it is also equipped with the best AA equipment.\n\nSubmarines- I don't believe I am the right person to be writing this portion but whatever: the submarines in this game operate in a nice way- if I had to say honestly its either them or aircraft carriers that have the highest skill cap- the submarines have to pay attention to a handful of things when they play more so than other ships- depth, oxygen, where enemies were last seen, distance from enemies, speed/oxygen/distance, when best to surface- probably the most engaging submarine play I have ever used in a game before\n\nBattleships- ah yes WW2 the age of the battleship (technically the dawn of the aircraft carrier but whatever) this is the ship I first planned to use and with much good luck, you aim your guns safely from behind a wall of friendlies while they/scout planes figure out enemy locations. Then you lead your target and wait as the coi(cone of impact) slowly shrinks down to an acceptable size, after firing you see your rounds fly beautifully through the air to the idiot that dare expose himself to your cannons! Nearly everything hits heavily crippling the enemy/ killing them.\n\nDestroyers + Light cruisers- these two play very similarly in my experience though honestly I havent play much of these, they rely heavily on torpedoes- have decent AA - and amongst other things can almost never be killed by the submarines- see speed and size - these two ships seem heavily reaction and observation based, if carriers and submarines are brains- destroyers and light cruisers are brawns(how fast and accurately can you react) for even a second late and that submarine we were just talking about has sunk you, not only that but you've brought shame to your fellow destroyers and cruisers >:(\n\nHeavy Cruisers + Anything else I mightve missed- I haven't played these ships types, I fell in love with aircraft carriers and just stopped every other research tree\n(lastly for all those claiming this is a copy of WoWs, no development for this would've had to been started before its announcement. In terms of UI and gameplay this is more similar to armored warfare. Lastly-lastly this game seems better balanced than wows as well as the torpedoes actually have an arming distance. Lastly-lastly-lastly this game is more realistic then wows.)","November 20, 2015","true","31.9"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","3","6","2","1"

But this game has more of a WoT feel to it(having to buy ammo/Dammage model). lets start with the Pros of the game ....\n\nPro:\n-as of writing this review this game (seems) to have more ships\n-Progression Seems fairly fast(if you win)\n-movement of the ships feel nice(tough a bit unrealistic acceleration and decelleration)\n-detailed shells (penetration values etc are listed(presumably also taken into account when shooting things i dont know if armor angle and thiner armored parts are modeled))\n-Nice sounding audio\n-Nice amount for detail on the map\n-Theres submarines but theyr fairly well balanced(in my opinion(for those wondering about subs more below))\n-The gameplay seems more enjoyable\n\nCons:\n-Doesnt look that good\n-Messy ship slection menu(in my opinion(stuff is all over the place))  (this might be due to my 4:3 screen)\n-possibly overpriced gold items(assuming the games uses a conversion rate about the same as WoWS /WoT(havent checked))\n-To get Crew you have to Pay gold\n-allot of ships seem to be paperdesigns and/or redesigns of alredy ingame ships\n\nPro/Cons (fall in both categorys);\n-No easy aim torpedos(this is also a con cause you got no clue where to aim so it becomes )\n-No ciritical/Citadel hits\n\nConclusions :\nits more of a WoT clone with somme WoWS stuff mixed in trying to stands its own in the F2P MMO vechiclecombat market. and i can understand it taking idea from other games cause if they work well might as well use them. and to shorten everything in this review to one description it would be: WoT(with somme WoWS mixed in) with warships and subs instead of tanks and arty. i have mixed feeling about this game and im not saying its bad but i dont recomend it either.(i put a Yes as recomendation since i found the game prety enjoyable for the time i played even tough im having a mixed feeling about it)\n\nScores:\nfor those wanting scores id give a this game a 4.5 to 6.5/10(rough estimate cause i  havent played it that much as of writing this) and WoWS a 6.5 to 7/10 as reffrence(keep in mind this is without a scoring system just on gut feeling)\n\nSubMarines:\nfor those wondering about submarines ... heres how they work:\nyou have a oxygen bar that charges while you above watter and depending on the depth(shallow or deep)it will get used up faster.and as the oxygen gets lower you will also start moving slower(i Believe havent realy looked at the speed). you can only fire your deck gun while submerged and only use your torpedoes when in shallow watter or submerged. tough when your submerged your not safe when in "shallow" depth you cans till get hit by depth charges (and i think artierly to rarely) and if you go to "deep" depth you will burn to your oxygen like anything youv ever seen. it also takes somme time to go up/down. when you press the assigned button you will get a WoW Like ability charge bar and as soon as that fils up you will start to raise or lower your depth(this part goes fairly fast tough maby a little to fast). and ontop of this submarines are only detectable via sonar when submerged. that said they seem prety balanced.","November 14, 2015","true","0.8"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

It's like that bag of chips you always get. It's not that great, but you'd just want more.\n\nAnywho, The aiming feels a tad clunky. nothing a few matches won't help you get used to. Gameplay wise, it's similar to World of Warships with more Ships. Light cruisers feels a bit heavy I would say. BB is... well, in WoW. You were this big hunk of hard metal. Slow but relatively hard to kill. In this game, they took all that hard metal away and replaced it with tin. Firepower is still there, but you can go down pretty quick especially from sneaky DDs/SS and CVs which drop torps and dive bombers on you. CVs are more like the same, RTS and all the shenanigans.  SS is what you'd expect and DDs are DDs. Annoying little buggers.\n\nAs for p2w concerns. There are "Premium" Ammo which are a cut above the rest which cost 2 gold(Cash currency) per ammo. Unfortunately, I have no idea how effective these are due to the game being fresh and all. Onwards we can also use cash currency to exchange it to EXP which used for researching upgrades and higher ship tiers and silver.\n\nAlright we got that over with, Should you play Steel Ocean?\n\nCertainly it's worth a try but in it's current state, there are alot of tweaking that needs to be made. if you don't want to go through the hassle, you might wanna steer clear and play World of warship instead.","November 13, 2015","true","18.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The whole line.  So yes, you can actually play sink the Bismarck!\n\nLet me get the negative out of the way first: Visually this game is a bit dated. The ship controls are a bit arcadeish (but still fun and in a way, doesn't ruing the immersion if that makes sense.\n\nThat's it.  The rest is all positive.\n\nThis game actualy manages to get that rock paper scissors gameplay correct.  Submarines are incredibly deadly to battleships, but are countered by DDs and CLs.  DDs can wreck BBs if they get in close, but CLs tear them to pieces.  CLs and BBs are the primary targets for BBs, and the BBs main advantage (range and firepower) are modelled nicely.  CVs take a lot of skill to work right, but a tight fleet formation can ruin an air attack's day.\n\nI like that the heavy weapons are not unlimited ammo.  You can't spam torps all the time, you have to be careful.  Torps have a minimum arming range, making suicide rushes a thing of the past.  There is no real aim assist for guns or torps, making both fair.  Heavier ships can switch to lighter secondary armament for taking on enemy light vessels and aircraft, giving a smart player a modicum of protection close in.\n\nThe game tracks your ability to help your team.  Are you a stealthy DD spotting for your fleet?  You get points and experience for that.  Radio Ranges and radar ranges become important, since if you scout too far ahead, no one will get your data, and your fleet can't rain down fire on the enemy.\n\nOverall, the co-operative nature of the fleet based gameplay makes this a solid choice in my view.  There's tons of ships and lines to unlock, each type of ship has its own unique feel and gameplay style meaning that there should be something for everyone.  The game rewards teamwork and skill, and punishes lone wolfing (unless you are a sub, in which case that's your gameplay style).\n\nIt's frankly great fun.  I'm sure that as the playerbase keeps growing (never less then 30 seconds for a match for me)  the game will become even better with updates to the visuals.  As it stands, it's probably the most naval fun you can have these days.","December 10, 2015","true","374.6"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","1"

Follows the War Thunder/World of Tanks etc. model , however there is one huge thing that sets it apart from the crowd: variety.\n\nYes, the biggest thing I love about this game is that it has a huge amount of gameplay variety compared to some of these other games.\n\n-Destroyers (my favorite) are fast, agile, and are deadly at close range with depth charges to destroy submarines and torpedoes to take out carriers and battleships. Now, eventually the subs get smart and realize that if they surface they can avoid your depth charges and are almost too small to hit with your main guns. BUT what they don't seem to have caught on to yet, is that you can actually ram any ship smaller than you and it typically results in an instant kill, so if an enemy sub surfaces to try to escape the depth charges just smash into them.\n\n-Cruisers are essentially larger destroyers- more health, and bigger guns. They are maneuverable enough to dodge torpedoes and are quite effective against Destroyers. Light Cruisers have depth charges, making them alright against subs, and Heavy Cruisers have main batteries making them able to punch through the armor of Battleships at long range.\n\n-Battleships are the big guns, able to deal ridiculous amounts of damage at very long range. They are good at destroying pretty much any ship except Submarines and Destroyers which are small enough to practically ignore their volleys. Their major drawback is that they require Carriers, Destroyers, or Submarines to scout for them so that they can stay back and deal damage without getting into torpedo range.\n\n-Submarines are the stealth hunters. They can submerge under water and become immune to most attacks, at the cost of speed and limited oxygen supply. Going just below the surface allows them to fire (and be struck by) torpedoes while avoiding cannon fire, and diving deeper makes them safe from everything except depth charges. Because they are slow while underwater and vulnerable to depth charges, they are very vulnerable to Destroyers, but extremely strong against Battleships and Carriers which basically cannot hurt them.\n\n-Carriers are the odd ones out that don't really fall into the Rocks Paper Scissors circle. They can send scout planes all over the map, making them excellent for recon, and can harass ships with dive bombers, destroy enemy planes with fighters, and even take out subs with torpedo bombers. However, planes can be shot down fairly easy if the victim is paying attention, so they are most effective at taking out ships already engaged in combat.\n\nWhat ends up happening in most matches is, the Battleships and Carriers sit back, while the Destroyers, Subs, and Cruisers usually charge in. Carriers are ironically the first to the front lines with their planes. Because Battleships are the most powerful in terms of dealing damage, the trick is to scout out the position of the enemy Battleships so that your Battleships can destroy the enemy's while yours stay hidden. Alternatively, if your Submarines can sneak past the enemy Destroyers, they can easily destroy their Battleships and Carriers as well.\n\nOr if you like to yolo it up like me, you can just play a Destroyer and charge straight at the enemy Battleship. If you're still in one piece by the time you get close, you're going to be getting a lot of kills.\n\nThis variety makes every ship play totally differently, you really feel like you are important to your team as everyone has their own role to play. It's free and worth your time.","November 17, 2015","true","59.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

However, I like the additional features in this game\nFirstly, it is not a WoWs clone, I've played both for a while, and Steel Ocean has always filled in the fun part. DDs are no longer the kamikaze maniacs, they are the forward scouts and the trolling machines that run over little subs that are running out of air xD, I'll admit, I'm one of the DDs.\nBattleships are not the big fat tanks, (they're still big and fat, but they're not tanks). They can take alot of hits, but they won't be like the KV1 in a tier V match (if you've played WoT you'll know what I mean). Alot more realistic in the regard that Battleships can easily one salvo kill cruisers and destroyers. So, fellow cruiser captains, keep zigzagging, BECAUSE BATTLESHIPS HAVE KILLER RANGE! Like in reality, BBs can hurl 12-18inch rounds over extreme distances, but of course, that gives you alot of time to turn. BBs are not the tanks, they are the lucky hitters. Miss, and you'll be eating a whole barrage of torpedoes in the 40 seconds to takes to reload. Hit the target, and type brb in the chat coz your going to get a cuppa tea.\nCruisers, YES FINALLY THEY HAVE HEAVY CRUISERS WHICH ACTUALLY ARE DIFFERENT TO LIGHT CRUISERS! Yes folks, especially for me, a cruiser fan, heavy cruisers are a nice balance between the BB and the CL. Nice heavy battery which has similar firing system to the Battleships. Long range, high pen, high damage, decent reload. Light Cruisers are the little panzer ICs of steel ocean (WoT reference again). They carry light artillery but with amazing reload speeds. Use HE on battleships and they'll be burning in seconds, use AP on destroyers to literally smash them apart.\nSubmarines are fun too, but I've never made it past the oxygen timer since the moment i dive.\nCarriers are no longer OP torpedo launching machines (phew). Dive Bombers actually have a place now. Instead of watching wave after wave of torpedoes, you may have to watch out for dive bombers.\nThats pretty much it of this lecture.

I've only played it a few minutes, and the only reason I stopped (for the moment) is due to a crash that occurred. Since this is still a very new game, I can certainly understand that such is to be expected. Rather than complain, I'll explain what I was doing when the error and subsequent crash happened, in hopes that the developer(s) will be able to look into it.\n\nI was just getting into the Radio and Recon tutorial (the second tutorial). I was firing my weapons at the first enemy target. I'd already fired one salvo of my main guns, and landed hits. Then I fired a salvo of torpedoes, immediately backed by switching to and firing a salvo of my main guns again. This is when the game crashed and closed, showing a small error dialogue with Chinese Hanzi (I sadly do not know how to read any Chinese Hanzi, so do not know what it said) and the word ERROR immediately next to the Chinese Hanzi.\n\nJust in case it helps to give the devs some insight to the error, here are my system specifications:\nMotherboard: Gigabyte Technology Co., Ltd.

The game's optimization is absolutely terrible, for some reason there are some specific moments when it freezes for some seconds (switching to depth charges and closing the scouting vision, just to name a few). It's a bit laggy and since it still is fairly new there aren't many players so the queue times are quite long, but it has its charm. The controls are fine, though there are some things that could use some adjustment, such as the lock-on system for main guns (the camera not resetting to where your guns are aiming is kind of a bummer). For some reason I can't get used to the camera being placed just above the water when you're trying to aim your side guns, which ends up tunnel-visioning your line of sight a bit and makes it very awkward to do so.\n\nAnyway, these are all things that I, personally, can't get used to and, as a WoWS player, I can't imagine why the devs would think of making some controls and mechanics so different from one game to the other. So I don't understand why there must be so many differences between WoWS and SO control-wise, since that's usually the first thing that scares off new players (and, with that, potential customers). It still has many interesting stuff going on, the subs, the different firing modes and so. Artistically speaking, the music is also excellent and there're a lot of details put into every ship, even if the poor graphics kinda destroy the whole purpose.\n\nI might continue playing it since it really has tons of potential, this can get to be a great nautical warfare game, we'll just have to give it some time and wait for the community to grow big enough.","November 25, 2015","false","3.8"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","47","7","15","2","0"

As wargaming.net fans like to say "a world of warships for poor people" in the reviews. Sure the graphics isn't as beautiful as WoWS, but least they ain't asking 35-70 bucks for a "special edition" ship.\n\nThe gameplay is simple: 16 vs 16 ships. You got your destroyers, cruisers, your battleships and aircraft carriers. But they added a submarine. Good Job on their part being one step ahead of wargaming. Second, their appears to be more factions(including france) on the way. The reward systems along with the tutorial is great and smooth. One battle I had enough xp to uprade my cruisers and jump on to the battleship and fully upgrade it.\n\nThe combat is a little different than WoWs. For one you can see the torpedoes coming at you(which is why wargaming.net fans are slapping negative reviews on this game) instead of appearing at the last minute, and they have a safe/denonate zone. Since I went BB(battleship) on the USA, the south carolina feels like its faster than the WoWS version, and it's turrets move much faster than WoWS as well. The thing that interests me was the hawkeye mode which made me like a sniper.  You get officers but they have stats instead of adding stats to them. But that's all I know for the combat.\n\nNow for the negatives so far. Sometimes lag kicks in and I go from the ocean to crashing into the land. And their are torpedo spammers that hit you rather than the enemy sometimes. And of course, you may have to spend money to grind much faster. Looking at those tech trees, got a long way to go.\n\nSteel Ocean is not bad. It shows promise. I like it so far, I feel its more fun and ships than WoWS, but that's just me. Give it a try.

It's like dragging a paper box on your desk, the ship speeds up like a race car, breaks like an UFO, it's just no where near what a warship should be like. Hard to describe what exactly went wrong, it just doesn't feel right.\n\nJudging by the interface, I'd say it's a copycat of Battle Station: Pacific. It just reminds me so much of that game, everything seems to be exactly the same. The whole thing just feels like they brought BS:P back to life and mix-breed with WoT which is actually the fun part of the game.\n\nWhat pisses me off the most is, if they're copying an old classic, they shoul atleast make it look better, with a more decent graphic and interface, after all, that game they're copying is published 6 years ago. But no, just like everyone else said, it's graphics is terrible.\n\nPeople have made games with better graphics in the 00's.\n\nI've had some frustrating times playing World of Warships, but after playing this, I think I'll enjoy WoW just fine.","November 17, 2015","false","2.2"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

Boy, was I disappointed.\n\nThe game itself tries, and fails, to be a World of Warships clone. It includes EVERYTHING - and I mean EVERYTHING - about World of Warships into it, EXCEPT the graphics, excellent model designs, and excellent physics.

My grandfather served on USS Iowa during Korea, his ship and other ships were kept in pristine condition during service. That isn't an exaggeration. These ships were the homes for Sailors and Marines for months and years. When I see the ships in these games, it's like they pulled them out of decommission graveyards such as the one my grandpa visited in San Pedro, LA to see a rotten version of his ship.\n\nIf a ship is put back into service, they're cleaned up, restored, and upgraded with modern tech ( sometimes weapons) like USS Iowa was over the years before being transported by tug boats to it's current resting place.

Part of the intensity of naval combat is waiting for your guns to come to bear.  Ships that steer quickly negate the delay in placing the guns on target.\n\nThe aiming system treats the gun accuracy as if this is an FPS.  Holding aim longer improves the accuracy.  This introduces a level of intensity in taking a shot.  However, this method does not hold up well as a simulation.\n\nThe ship spotting system is a novel approach.  Ship positioning becomes a tactic in determining enemy disposition.\n\nI must admit.  I only played for just over half an hour.

And listen, that pains me to say, because I wanted this game to be another great naval warfare game to play. Right now World of Warships has a monopoly on the genre and this game is no competition. I guess I will pick it apart...\n\nFirst, ships travel WAY too fast and are completely out of perspective. The distance marker says you're 2km away, yet you can still see details on the ship that shouldn't be visible from that distance... (I realize many people won't care about this but it take away from the immersion and therefore is a con)\n\nNext, and this is game breaking, there is no friendly fire... I literally watched a player shoot his torpedo through his teammate's ship (that's right THROUGH IT!!) so he could sink his enemy!!! WOW! This one aspect alone is what made me uninstall the game. No friendly fire, and ghosting is a game breaking mechanic.\n\nSailing your ship is like walking in a FPS, using WASD, you literally have to keep the keys pressed the whole time to move... it's not sailing, it's walking on water... and it's not enjoyable at all.\n\nThe tech tree is EXTREMELY hard to read. I use a 49" 1080p monitor and I had to get 3 feet away from the screen to actually see the thumbnails. There's no harbor preview, just a spreadsheet for the stats and a tiny marker to tell you what kind of ship it is; DD, BB, CV, etc...\n\nOh, and then there is what seemed to be a quite toxic chat community. I tried to speak about these issues in world chat and was met with trolls on the level of LoL... the mere mention of WoWs and these people start throwing their feces at you like monkeys.\n\nOh, I thought of a "Pro", this game has Submarines.... not that it matters because the game is broken.\n\nSeriously, just go play World of Warships and save yourself a ton of bandwidth and time...","April 17","false","0.8"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

Total BS.  The developers seem not to comprehend that the primary purpose of those incredibly tall masts was to see with the aided eye 20 to 40 miles away.  But, no, whole squadrons magically appear, then often enough disappear as you attempt to target disappearing ships only a few hundred yards away.  Hardly worth playing when you think you have maneuvered well only to find yourself suddenly surrounded at short range.  Must have been hiding behind that big wave yonder, I suppose.\n\nThat's just stupid.\n\nThe lack of promotion is also weird, limiting population, hence limiting motivation to contribute real money to this toy.\n\nDink with it as a freebie, enjoy the rare moments of team play and avoid getting upset when the invisible armada hits you from six directions all at once, and none more than 500 yards or so away.\n\nHistory's blindest lookouts make this an absurdity, so play it as such, and perhaps through that amazing miasmic fog we might yet discover how the developers plan on making money from this albatross.  The "suck you in" then dole out copious amounts of real dough I consider more scam than market strategy, but it sinks of its lack of weight as of this writing because it out-arcades the arcade.","January 7","true","425.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","3"

No RNG here, just who can shoot better.\n-No aim assist for torpedoes, and you can fire torpedoes individually or in a salvo, this makes the the torpedo an area denial/ distraction weapon for the ships that have it.\n-Arm time for torpedoes eliminates DD/CL suicide runs.\n-The longer you focus your aim, the tighter the spread, again, no RNG here, the patient ones can hit a lot more than the one who is shooting wildly.\n-The presence of submarines in the game (unrealistic as they are), forces destroyers and light cruisers to play a bigger role than just a scout, protecting the heavy cruisers and battleships and forces players to work as a cohesive unit.\n-Premium items are hardly, if at all noticeable.\n-Aircraft carriers can customize their wing, which can help players who wants to tune their wing to defense (fighters for escort) or offense (dive and torpedo bombers).\n-Aircraft carriers can also take control of their main battery (DP cannons) which can give them a fighting chance against destroyers and light cruisers.\n-Night battle mode, which has players using star shells and spotlights to spot and engage hostile warships. A very fun mode.\n-More nations, though some of them are incomplete and mostly premium ships, though it will inevitably grow as the game develops.\n-Movement of the ships affects accuracy, which is kinda realistic. This is especially true in the older warships and the Japanese ships which historically used optical rangefinders  (cannot include gun-laying radar ingame for obvious reasons). Zig- zagging while firing your cannons ain't gonna do much here.\n-Faster shells, in WoWs, the shells feel more like guided missiles.\n-Decent grinding to unlock ships and equipment.\n-Commander system where the commanders assigned to ships give the ship a boost in certain stats (speed, firepower, reload time, durability) When a commander is assigned to become a captain, he can use a skill which can drastically increase a certain stat for a limited amount of time.\n-Rewards for logging in consecutively for a number of days such as commanders and ships.\nCons:\n-One server (NA) which presents difficulties for other players to enjoy the game, though if this game grows they will have to open new servers due to the player traffic.\n-No seperate tech trees for light and heavy cruisers, forcing players to change playstyles frequently to play the cruisers.\n-Price for premium ships are ridiculous.\n-Wonky physics, with battleships getting up to speed in seconds.\n-Game is dying, lack of players.\n-Crashes up the wazoo.\n\nEDIT: Now they have introduced a German proxy, does wonders to non-NA players.

Only heavy cruisers are hard too reach.\nThe Japanese and US-Navy have a complete ship tree. In the german tree the destroyers and carriers are still missing.\nA UK-, China- and France-Navy are coming too.\n\nThe graphics are not the best, but good but the sounds are great.\nThe matchmaking works fast and is good balanced.\nThis game just makes fun. There a gold items you can buy, but it is not really a pay to win.\nThe most important thing you should buy are ships slots, because there are a lot of ships you can get.\n\n\nEDIT: 31.12.2015\nMeanwhile some Lines of UK has arrived (CV,DD).\n\nFigured out that Destroyers can be more dangerous than Battleships. In some battles i sunk some battleships with my torps, because they ignored me.\nI still love this game because with the right tactics you can win and rule the game. Teamplay is the key.\n\nIf you are a good player than you can easily afford Camouflages, flags and expensive ship upgrades.\nIn later gameplay you can also pimp your ship with the right combination of commanders.\n\nThere are some daily, weekly and monthly events, which brings you a great things to unlock like Free XP, Silver-Money, VIP-Access, consumables and points to unlock new commanders.\n\n\nBTW: I tried World of Warships too, but it makes no fun for me.\n- no subs\n- CPU controlled guns (secondary and AA)\n- torpedo angle precalculation\n- no aiming circle\n- autopilot?","December 5, 2015","true","159.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Optimization is terrible right now and no word of when if ever they will work on it.\n2. The blocks in chat make it all but impossible to have a meaningful discussion.\n3. 2. is probably because of the terrible immature players in chat. Very little is any kind of help about game. Its like listening to a lot of 8 yr old's giggling and whispering naughty words to each other. It needs a moderator bad and they wont get one or can't.\n3. The lack of communication from SO in forum leaves one feeling they have abandoned the game.\n4. NA server is so lacking in players you have many games at 3 vs 3 when it should be 15 vs 15.\n5 Although they have fair tutorial on how to use your ships, they have nothing on how the commanders work except a slightly confusing, short script of what they do. It could be a lot better.\n6. Lastly the updates are rather few, small, (not much content) and not very dynamic.\nNOTE: as I said, if you can shrugg off all of these, the game is for a while at least fun.\nAnd yes I have about 500 + games in it and am good at it.

Mergelsberg","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mergelsberg/","158 products in account","Product received for free\n\nThe game seems solid, it looks good, it runs well, the tutorials are pretty excellent.\n\nHowever, there is no real playerbase active. Getting into PvP matches takes really long and usually ends up with 3v3. The PvE is basically unplayable because the bots only care about other bots and do not consider the player to be present at all. Meaning you will be dodging torpedoes from friendly bots more than anything else. Bots will ram you, push you off course if they want to make to make a turn.\n\nMaybe this game is playable if there were many more players online. But the fact is there aren't. Getting a queue with more than 30 players in it in total is an exception.\n\nLast but not least there is only a North American server. I normally have excellent pings to game servers in the EU, but this server gives me 130ms latency at the bare minimum. Even the ingame indicator says my connection isn't good enough.\n\nSo with the terrible lag on the server, the lack of a playerbase. It doesn't matter how good the game is, because it's not possible to play the game to any depth.","May 23","false","2.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","1"

At first glance, there were some things that bothered me, such as the flawed chat censoring that borders on funny with what it does/doesn't filter.\n\nHowever, the more I have played, the deeper I have been pulled into the game. I hear complaints all the time about how this or that is unbalanced, but generally I have found it is the person and not the game that is unbalanced. Some complain about subs or carriers being too weak, but played well they can be the terrors in a fight. Part of this is also that some classes of ship get better at higher tiers (i.e. levels).\n\nThe game is actually very complex and part of the problem is many players don't learn the role of their ship well. For instance, spotting is based on a wide variety of factors (capability of the ship, upgrades, commanders, equipment, speed, etc) and destoyers are the primary spotters for their side. However many players will charge in with their destroyer to attempt close range torpedo runs (which can be deadly) and die quickly due to their low armor. Battleships without something to spot for them are considerably more disadvantaged despite all the firepower at their disposal.\n\nAnother example is that the part of the ship you hit also has a significant impact on the amount of damage you do and the parts of the ship that you can damage destroy. This is something you start to learn and try to take advantage of as you play. Beyond that, your choice of commanders can make a significant difference in many ways: do you want to be more accurate, do more damage when you hit, see further, reload faster, etc.\n\nSure, there are paid options that can help give a player some advantages (true in any type of game like this), but they aren't absolute trump cards like some games. Sure,  you can buy "gold" ammo/torpedoes, but they still have to hit you with them to make them count. There are "gold" ships, but typically they aren't any better than a fully upgraded ship of the same tier (i.e. level). You can spend gold to get more commanders, but there are options to get commanders without gold as well, it just takes more time.\n\nAll in all a good game that I enjoy to play. I only wish there were more players to make matchmaking take place more quickly. Sometimes you have to guage at which tier and which class of ship will give you the bast chance of getting a match quickly, and that is another skill you need to learn in the game.","May 25","true","429.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

As it is currently however, I have no idea why anyone would claim its "better than word of warships". Frankly, there is no point comparing this game to WoWS, aside from them both being about naval warfare, its like trying to say warthunder is better than world of tanks (They're two different games going for two different styles of play...) lets get the negatives out of the way first\n\n-- Momentum: torpedos are near useless when ships can stop and turn on a dime like  a tank. Part of these naval battles is calculating where your opponent will be when your shot lands. Part of those calculations are momentum, said calculations being voided when you can come to a complete stop at a rate of deceleration that should be impossible, its overly difficult to say the least.\n\n--Punishing team killers: first match I played had no less than four teamkillers that started shooting allies and torpedo spamming right at the start, just on my team alone. teamkillers and greifers ruin the fun in a game, 'nuff said\n\n-- Polish: currently, the game is poorly optimized and my alienware laptop has a hard time running it at low settings. I don't mind playing at low settings, but when my game on low settings has a framerate that looks like its having a seizure, I've got a problem with that...\n\nOK, the bad is out of the way, now lets talk about the good, and there is a lot of good, which makes me looking forward to when this game gets some needed polish and updates\n\n-- Battlestations midway style control: You have almost complete control over your arsenal on the warship. You can switch between gun salvos and individual barrel firing. you can launch one torpedo at a time or several at once, enabling you to lay down your own custom torpedo spreads and make some nasty strikes. You can also contrl your own AA guns and secondary batteries, not having to put your faith into AI gunnery.\n\n-- Good graphics* : Ok, the game isn't very well optimized right now and I can barely run it at all in a match, but I can still see what the game "should" look like when in the tutorial by myself. It looks good, nice environments and good looking ships, nice details, etc. Once the game is properly optimized, I think its safe to say it will sure be pretty to look at\n\n-- Sound: what can I say? the warships sound like warships. The guns sound as mean as you'd imagine a naval cannon should sound, the tropedos launching are convincing, the AA guns sound right...I haven't heard enough of the music to make a decision on whether I like it or not, but its definitely not bad. Firing your guns is almost as satisfying as hitting your target and dealing big damage\n\n-- straightforward progression and upgrade system: self explanatory, if you played any of the "world of (vehicles)" games you know what I mean.\n\n-- gameplay mechanics: there are many mechanics that just feel like they fit perfectly, assuming that the cons mentioned above can be adressed\n\n-- Submarines: Ok, I'm not a fan, personally, but I can appreciate the addition of subs. some people like them, I'm still undecided if I like them or not, but they're here.\n\nin short, there is a lot to like about this game, but there is still work to be done before I'd consider jumping in and really getting involved. Still...from what I've seen, I'm interested to see where this will go. When things get better and the game gets its needed optimization, I'll jump in and have another go, but as it is, I can't enjoy it just yet.","December 5, 2015","true","0.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It is not ballanced in any shape or way. DO NOT BOTHER! The only thing that this has over World of Warships is the fact that the matches are much more fair in the sense that you wont get into a match against something more than 1 tier above you. But because this sorry excuse of a game has nobody playing it other than a few hundred people at a time, end game is at tier 5 rather than the tier 10 which the game goes up to. All the people that play stay at tier 1-3 because those are where they encounter the most games. And if you decide to play this, dont even bother playing Submarines. Their combat is so unbalanced because the only weapons they have at their disposal is broken and has a minimum range so if you hit an enemy in that range, you essentially do nothing.

Reason being is that although the ship-to-ship battles can be very fun and involving, the main problem I found, (in my view) is the implementation of Submarine Combat. Although there are ships that can use the depth charges to take out the submarines, they were often the first ones to be destroyed by the submarines or by other ships.   Apart from that issue, the rest of the game was very enjoyable, with great ship modles and impressive sound design too. The buisness modle isnt very invasive either, and researching new ships doesnt feel like a grind (unlike other games similar to this one),\n\nIf you can get around the irritating "over-powered" feel of the submarine combat, then this is a pretty good f2p title to try out.    For me however, unless the sub combat is adjusted to give other ships that dont use depth charges an actual fighting chance, I wont be returning any time soon.\n\nBest of luck on your battles capitan.","December 8, 2015","false","1.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","2"

It is more of a WoT relative than a WoWS relative. What that means is WoWS mechanics are drastically different than WoT, and rightfully so, as a ship is drastically different from a tank. Steel Ocean basically carries a lot of similar mechanics that you would see in WoT, such as aiming circles, repair kits as consumables, crew slots instead of 1 commander, etc. While I haven't played enough to decide whether or not I like how this is implemented, it does make the game different enough from WoWS to be worth playing.\n\nNow for some pros and cons.\n\nPros:\n- Gameplay seems a bit more skill based than WoWS with things such as no aim assist with the guns and torpedos, and that you are in full control over your guns ie secondaries and AA do not fire on their own. You switch to them and fire them yourself.\n-High variety of playstyles. With 6 different classes of ships, this game does offer more variety.\n-Smooth gameplay that will run on most computers.\n-More fast paced than WoWS. This detracts from the realism a bit but at the same time it keeps the entertainment going.\n-Familiar mechanics yet still feel fresh.\n-Thorough tutorial.\n-Rewards players for in game actions.\n\nCons:\n-Graphically very dated.\n-UI, especially in menus is very small and seems to have a poor resolution. at 1080p on my 42" TV it is difficult to make out a lot of the text.\n-Poor sound fidelty.\n\nHowever the biggest con of all for me personally is the cost of any premium content in the game. This will be the main reason why I cant justify playing this game. I am a fairly competitive player, and I know that in these FtP games, just like WoT and WoWS, premium time and other premium (paid) content really does help. Most FtP games do a good job of not making their premium content overpowered so as to make it a pay to win enviroment, but the content is generally very beneficial in other aspects.\n\nThe problem here is the cost of the content. 180 days of premium time (VIP time in game) is very high. You're looking at  50$ USD for 180 days. So 100$ per year. Thats more than an Xbox live subscription by almost double. There are premium ships that will cost around 100$. Conversion of gold to silver gives you 170 in game currency for 1$ USD. That amount of silver wont even buy most tier 1-2 ships upgrades.\n\nI will admit, when i play these FtP games i like to play it on premium. The dev should deserve money for their creation, but the costs are way to high, especially since I have to factor in converting USD to CAD.\n\nUntil the prices drop I cannot afford to play this game, and will have a hard time enjoying it compared to WoWS when i can afford to play that one on Prem time.","November 21, 2015","false","3.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

This is a failed reskin of World of Warships that was made because, and this is just my guess, some of the devs for this didnt get into the World of Warships alpha, so they cried and then put out this failure of a game. It is not ballanced in any shape or way. DO NOT BOTHER! The only thing that this has over World of Warships is the fact that the matches are much more fair in the sense that you wont get into a match against something more than 1 tier above you. But because this sorry excuse of a game has nobody playing it other than a few hundred people at a time, end game is at tier 5 rather than the tier 10 which the game goes up to. All the people that play stay at tier 1-3 because those are where they encounter the most games. And if you decide to play this, dont even bother playing Submarines. Their combat is so unbalanced because the only weapons they have at their disposal is broken and has a minimum range so if you hit an enemy in that range, you essentially do nothing. I would say save your time and find something better or wait for either this or World of Warships devs to get their ♥♥♥♥ together, but should you play either I wish you the best of luck.","November 29, 2015","false","18.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

Reason being is that although the ship-to-ship battles can be very fun and involving, the main problem I found, (in my view) is the implementation of Submarine Combat. Although there are ships that can use the depth charges to take out the submarines, they were often the first ones to be destroyed by the submarines or by other ships.   Apart from that issue, the rest of the game was very enjoyable, with great ship modles and impressive sound design too. The buisness modle isnt very invasive either, and researching new ships doesnt feel like a grind (unlike other games similar to this one),\n\nIf you can get around the irritating "over-powered" feel of the submarine combat, then this is a pretty good f2p title to try out.    For me however, unless the sub combat is adjusted to give other ships that dont use depth charges an actual fighting chance, I wont be returning any time soon.\n\nBest of luck on your battles capitan.","December 8, 2015","false","1.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","2"

I think that speaks for itself. Even though they are kinda hard to play.\n+Aircraftcarriers: You can adjust your plane setup as much as you want it to be, not like in WOWs where you have pregiven setups.\n+ You can control: Main battery, AA GUNS, Torpedoes (Fire one at a time). You can also drop underwater charges from a cruiser to give submarines a hard time. Only Machineguns are controlled by AI.\n+More things to research.\n+ Customization for ingame Cash -> Lasts only for 7 Days but its not that expensive if you are good player. I think 12k for a camo, thats not much.\n+ The Grind: Grinding isnt a pain in the a** that much, it becomes harder if you go up the Tiers and thats good in my opinion because you keep a ship longer and learn more about it's strenghtes and weaknesses.\n+ Runs good on weaker PC's, much adjustment to the graphics can be done.\n\nTheres more, find out for yourself, but every good game brings negative aspects with it.\n\n- Physics: The ships accelerate to fast and stop to fast, the weight of the Ships is not to much of a factor yet.\n- Shipclasses: The Battleships are crushing right now, the main guns shred everything, hope it's going to be nerfed.\n- Matchmaking: Because many people play Battleships right now or Submarines in lower tiers, the matchmaking becomes odd sometimes but you never play with Ships that are higher than 2 Tiers, except you play with a friend who is Tier 3 when you are Tier 1.\n- Performance: With some things in the graphics the performance gets kind of bad, the FPS drop down to 20, the game isn't very old so it's more of a "hopefully gets fixed" negative point.\n- No European server, normally american server is no problem for me, if my internet has a bad day, I am unable to play but same as above, they will most likely work on that.\n\nThese are my main points I want to Stick out to the people thinking about getting the game, it's for free and the dev's are working constantly on it, so give it a shot.\n\nIn the end I can say that this game surprised me in a positive way and I think there is much to come.","December 20, 2015","true","12.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

As it is currently however, I have no idea why anyone would claim its "better than word of warships". Frankly, there is no point comparing this game to WoWS, aside from them both being about naval warfare, its like trying to say warthunder is better than world of tanks (They're two different games going for two different styles of play...) lets get the negatives out of the way first\n\n-- Momentum: torpedos are near useless when ships can stop and turn on a dime like  a tank. Part of these naval battles is calculating where your opponent will be when your shot lands. Part of those calculations are momentum, said calculations being voided when you can come to a complete stop at a rate of deceleration that should be impossible, its overly difficult to say the least.\n\n--Punishing team killers: first match I played had no less than four teamkillers that started shooting allies and torpedo spamming right at the start, just on my team alone. teamkillers and greifers ruin the fun in a game, 'nuff said\n\n-- Polish: currently, the game is poorly optimized and my alienware laptop has a hard time running it at low settings. I don't mind playing at low settings, but when my game on low settings has a framerate that looks like its having a seizure, I've got a problem with that...\n\nOK, the bad is out of the way, now lets talk about the good, and there is a lot of good, which makes me looking forward to when this game gets some needed polish and updates\n\n-- Battlestations midway style control: You have almost complete control over your arsenal on the warship. You can switch between gun salvos and individual barrel firing. you can launch one torpedo at a time or several at once, enabling you to lay down your own custom torpedo spreads and make some nasty strikes. You can also contrl your own AA guns and secondary batteries, not having to put your faith into AI gunnery.\n\n-- Good graphics* : Ok, the game isn't very well optimized right now and I can barely run it at all in a match, but I can still see what the game "should" look like when in the tutorial by myself. It looks good, nice environments and good looking ships, nice details, etc. Once the game is properly optimized, I think its safe to say it will sure be pretty to look at\n\n-- Sound: what can I say? the warships sound like warships. The guns sound as mean as you'd imagine a naval cannon should sound, the tropedos launching are convincing, the AA guns sound right...I haven't heard enough of the music to make a decision on whether I like it or not, but its definitely not bad. Firing your guns is almost as satisfying as hitting your target and dealing big damage\n\n-- straightforward progression and upgrade system: self explanatory, if you played any of the "world of (vehicles)" games you know what I mean.\n\n-- gameplay mechanics: there are many mechanics that just feel like they fit perfectly, assuming that the cons mentioned above can be adressed\n\n-- Submarines: Ok, I'm not a fan, personally, but I can appreciate the addition of subs. some people like them, I'm still undecided if I like them or not, but they're here.\n\nin short, there is a lot to like about this game, but there is still work to be done before I'd consider jumping in and really getting involved. Still...from what I've seen, I'm interested to see where this will go. When things get better and the game gets its needed optimization, I'll jump in and have another go, but as it is, I can't enjoy it just yet.","December 5, 2015","true","0.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

After stumbling across this I looked for others similar and came across World of Warships, so this is mostly comparing to that game.\n\nThis game seems to focus more on realism than WoWS. The travel speed of the ships, the responsiveness to turning, the rate of fire of the cannons/torpedoes/AA/etc feel much more real.\n\nThe graphics are beautiful, the ocean looks very realistic. The physics are great, but would like to see some more variation in the waves. The ships look awesome and are incredibly detailed. Customization is fairly minimal, with a set list of patterns avaialble and flags as options. This will transition into the cons of the game as these customizations are only avaialble permanently with the purchase of gold with real money.\n\nThe cons of this game come in to the upgrade system I feel. With 33.1 hrs in game at this point, playing between submarines and battleships, I have only been able to achieve a rank 5 ship. Moving forward from here I feel the upgrades are coming to come much slower. With the amount of XP required almost doubling each rank, without paying for their Premium Gold, which is rather expensive, seems like it woulds take hundreds of hours to reach rank 10.\n\nTo purchase even one of the cheapest avaialble ships via Gold, you're looking at probably spending 50+ dollars, and this would only get you about as far as rank 5 as well. The farthest avaialble gold purchase only seems to be rank 8 as well, which I personally feel is great since you can't immediately skip to the end, but again to reach this rank immediately would be looking at +$100 US to purchase.\n\nOverall, as a casual player this game is a load of fun, and would recommend this game to anyone. Especially being free to play.","December 5, 2015","true","36.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

After stumbling across this I looked for others similar and came across World of Warships, so this is mostly comparing to that game.\n\nThis game seems to focus more on realism than WoWS. The travel speed of the ships, the responsiveness to turning, the rate of fire of the cannons/torpedoes/AA/etc feel much more real.\n\nThe graphics are beautiful, the ocean looks very realistic. The physics are great, but would like to see some more variation in the waves. The ships look awesome and are incredibly detailed. Customization is fairly minimal, with a set list of patterns avaialble and flags as options. This will transition into the cons of the game as these customizations are only avaialble permanently with the purchase of gold with real money.\n\nThe cons of this game come in to the upgrade system I feel. With 33.1 hrs in game at this point, playing between submarines and battleships, I have only been able to achieve a rank 5 ship. Moving forward from here I feel the upgrades are coming to come much slower. With the amount of XP required almost doubling each rank, without paying for their Premium Gold, which is rather expensive, seems like it woulds take hundreds of hours to reach rank 10.\n\nTo purchase even one of the cheapest avaialble ships via Gold, you're looking at probably spending 50+ dollars, and this would only get you about as far as rank 5 as well. The farthest avaialble gold purchase only seems to be rank 8 as well, which I personally feel is great since you can't immediately skip to the end, but again to reach this rank immediately would be looking at +$100 US to purchase.\n\nOverall, as a casual player this game is a load of fun, and would recommend this game to anyone. Especially being free to play.","December 5, 2015","true","36.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Ive never played World of Warships but when Im in global chat all I see if every ranting about how much better this game is. With most ships and specially subs you have a wide variety of how you play, from the destroyer which flies across the map and runs circles around the enemy, to the battleship which is a long range sniper, and then the aircraft carriers, although slightly tough to get used to its just amazing. However, no matter which class of ship you are, always have to be on the lookout for torps from the subs which sneak around.\n\nHowever, its not all good, I will say that the torpedo warning isnt enough, so if your someone who rages when they get killed because of something 'unseen' then i wouldnt reccommend this game. The warning for torpedo goes off just as your about to get hit and have nno time to move.\n\nBut overall, this game is a must get :)","December 5, 2015","true","629.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

When I was looking for a naval combat game it was between Steel Ocean and WoWS. As a naval warship simulation newb, I chose SO because it offers more control over the ships and seemed to have more realistic artillery aiming, not to mention ammunition limits. While the graphics are not as good as WoWS, they aren't bad enough to want to sacrifice a more well rounded naval experience\nBut I don't want this to turn into a comparison, there are enough of those available.\n\nAnyways, this game has pretty much had me hooked. From battle one, which I'm sure I was promptly turned into a hulking wreck, it had me wanting to do more battle. The more you die, the more you want to keep playing to get revenge or to tame your bruised ego. The satisfaction you get from blowing the **** out of your chosen enemy, dodging torpedos, multitasking steering and firing, and just watching the general mayhem is just too fun. Once you get a grasp of victory and start developing your ships and strategies, the fun doesn't stop. Victory truly is sweet in this game.\n\nYou don't really need to pay too much, if at all, to get some enjoyment out of the free to play game. I have paid about $20USD and I feel it's justified to speed up the ship upgrade process and get some additional perks without grinding too much.\n\nFor a free to play game, you can't go wrong to try. Always players online to battle. The more the merrier.  Just waiting for even more ships, maps and features. A game you can just grind yourself on and lose track of time.\n\n8/10","December 27, 2015","true","73.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Having night battles which WoWS doesn't have yet. I won't be arguing much with those WoWS fanboys because I've played WoWS myself and compared the two. I can say this game is way more better than WoWS. Others say that this game is purely arcade than WoWS which is true but WoWS itself is an arcade game too.\n\nSteel Ocean's gameplay is fast forwarded like 1.5x that's why you can see that shells fly faster, torpedo travels faster, ship moves faster, turret moves faster and so on. WoWS is into realism but not very realistic than War Thunder therefore it is still arcade. WoWS will let you play in a realistic-like naval warfare that will consume much of your time playing that game just by turning your turret, sailling etc..\n\nIf you wanna play this game in the highest graphics then be sure you are confident about it. The graphics of Steel Ocean has a lot of effort put in. WoWS fanboys deny this fact because they THINK that WoWS graphics is better but its actually the opposite.\n\nThe only positive thing I can say about WoWS is that it gives you more options to control the ship although most of them won't be used that much in every sortie.","December 28, 2015","true","41.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

So it makes gameplay really interesting.\n\nAnd its really all about teamwork, or kind of rock vs siccor.

But some carry scout planes.\n\nCL is anti sub dd CA CV. can scout better than BB and CA, some got scout planes.. also really fast.\n\n\nDD is anti sub and dd. And the most important in your team. Since they are the main scout, scout best in team. Lose all your dd and you will lose. Becuse your team will be blind. its also very fast and hard to hit.\n\nSS is very deadly if it can sneak up to your BB and CA. and harass behind enemy lines.\n\nCV is a little bit of all, it can scout, deal heavy damage etc.\n\nAnd this game is more realstic, In that case that you just cant get close with your DD or cruiser head on against BB.

Far from a simulation, but realistic enough to keep you going. The game is very well playable without going for the in-game purchases - so the 'free-to-play' really does apply. I'd be much happier though if this game offered a 'unlock' purchase for the full game experience instead of the aweful buy-in-game-currency system, but I get why the developer chose this option. Nontheless - it's fun and can become addictive (partially because of the frustration it sometimes invokes when you're so close to blowing up that enemy cruiser, only to be downed by one of their submarines.)\n\nGraphics are great when playing on ultra setting on a high resolution. Also tried playing it on a lower resolution on a lower setting on my laptop - but that was a complete and utter failure - really becomes unplayeable on low settings.","March 2","true","20.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

There's a lot to love and for the most part it is done very well - my single biggest gripe is connection issues, but these would be resolved if more people signed up to try - as the population expands it's worth the development team adding more server facility. Of course this is an assumption, but it's a reasonable one.\n\nPrimarily the game is PVP, but there are reasonable PVE tutorials with friends, to allow you to try the mechanics for yourself.\n\nGiven it's free, if you like WWII ship combat, you want to actually sail and aim (nothing overwhelmingly complex, but also a requirement for skill and intelligence) and you like having a variety of ship choices and some degree of customisation, plus the choice of ship size .. sub, destroyer, light and heavy cruisers, battleships and carriers ..

A ship taking a full salvo on magazine + engine + fuel tanks should not stay up for long, unlike in World of Warships - Mehh... depends on tastes\n+ SUBMARINES!!!! Take that World of Warships!! - Y no subs in WoWs???\n+ No aiming assistance, unlike in World of Warships - We aren't idiots, we can aim out turrets...\n+ Nice maps - open sea maps are awesome and add another level of strategy to the game that does not exist in WoWs\n+ Limited amount of ammunition - Nuff said\n+ Low system requirements - You don't need a GTX 980 to run this game\n\n... but soon after trying the game I found it's flaws, and they can't be ignored.\n- Low system requirements - Crappy graphics, perhaps a stone age game engine?\n- No physics whatsoever - Impossible to hit with a torpedo because ships can turn and stop almost instantly\n- Copy of WG games in a lot of ways - The aiming circle of each turret is the same as the aiming circle of Arty's on WoT (although this is awesome the rest of the stuff makes people become enraged at this game for copying WG...)\n\nThis game takes World of Warships, World of Tanks and Navyfield, and then adds the stuff that's missing to WoWs, like submarines and better control over the Aircraft Carrier's loadouts (using a system incredibly similar to the WoT interface for choosing cunsumables, shells loaded, etc...), and it looks like Navyfield in so many ways...\n\nBUT, it all ends after you see that the ship physics are garbage, ships accelerate and turn as fast as my car and because of that you can only hit the enemy with torps if one of the following occurs:\n> Enemy is dumb\n> You fire the torpedoes at 100 meters distance from the target\n> You throw the torpedoes with your bare hands at the deck of the enemy ship\n\nI played Navyfield for a long time, and I could handle the graphics of this game easily because most mechanics are enjoyable and well made, and being a copy of WG's games is not always bad, I would copy almost everything from this game to WoWs because it would make WoWs a GOD, or as it should be in the first place, but the physics kill the game, it makes the game feel more arcadeish than most arcade-like games.\n\nTL:DR: Try the game! It is a game with awesome mechanics (except physics), and if you've played WoWs you'll be thinking "Why isn't this on WoWs yet???", but don't expect much from a game that's being killed by WoWs players and the game's physics. This game is basically a Navyfield merge with WoWs and WoT, and if you've played any of these you'll feel comfortable with the gameplay, so don't be afraid to give it a try. I hate the physics, but will recommend the game anyways because it has a huge potential.","March 4","true","1.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

What is this? China? Jokes aside who decided what words to censor prob isn't fluent in english.\nDifference between tiers is high.\nSome ships are a bit too responsive and fast  and don't require much planning (but not by much)\nOverwhelming at times, having to control main guns, secondaries and AAA can be a bit hard at times. ...and airplanes are extremelly micro intensive.\n\nOverall I recomend this game and enjoy it greatly.\nSome people say it's "arcadie" vs WoW but it couldn't be further from the truth, in WoW steering, turret turning barely affect aim, captains in WoW are by far a lot more arcadie and inpractical, and torpedo safe range is hardly something to consider.\nThis game can be really fun if you put some effort in to getting good, if you stick to linear tactics and obvious gameplay you'll get owned.","May 24","true","552.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It will force you to work as a team or die alone and this aspect I love. Playing as a fleet will earn you many more victories than simply trying to get the most kills. Assist damage through spotting the enemy for your teamates is rewarded generously and I have had games where I've finished as MVP without firing a shot.\n\nThis game recieved a lot of negativity from reviewers about being pay to win, when most of these reviews had been to early into the game to really tell. With 600 battles and counting under my belt I can honestly say this is not the case. The biggest advantage one player can have over another is in commanders, whose skills can be used to boost certain attributes of your ship, they can be earned by completing daily/weekly quests. These commanders allow you to personalise your ships so you can focus on damage, speed, scouting and many more aspects; two ships of the class can be outfitted completely differently depending on your playstyle.\n\nI do well in game and I have only ever purchased VIP time and port slots.","February 9","true","806.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","2"

An while I enjoy Steel Ocean a bit more, there is some aspects of both games that if both were able to join forces they would make a game that was seriously bad a$$.\n\nPros:\nTorpedo Control is ALOT better then WoW.\nShips respond faster to controls.\nSubmarines!\nMore Playable Nations\nShip Classes have a different range of Tactics and forces a team to WORK AS A TEAM.\nEasy to grind EXP on lower levels.\nAnti Aircraft Gun Control **BANG BANG BANG** DIE DIRTY FLYING EARTHLINGS!\nBetter Carriers then WoW and Squadron Management.\n\nCons:\nGraphics are not as pretty as WoW\nConsumables are partly useless.. mainly smoke and COST ALOT of silver for basic things like repair, flood damage, fire control.\nAlot of the aspect of decorations for ships, camo, converting EXP cost gold which supports devs are more interested in making money for players at higher levels.\n\nOverall I enjoy this game, cause it has aspects of the game that are simply better then WoW. While I tried to get some of my other WoW friends to play it, they weren't as impressed to keep playing as I was. Seriously if the Devs joined forces with Wargaming WoW team and made a baby it would be a awesome experience and lay all other WWII Warship games to waste.\n\nTry it out.. just can't promise you will stay on it for long.\n","December 16, 2015","true","9.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You don't have to spend a single nickle to enjoy it. Graphics are good. Sound is fine. Playerbase is rather small right now, which is unfortunate since some of the matches will end up 5v5.\nMany people compare it to World of Warships.\nI would recommend downloading it and giving it a whirl. You might find you like it.\n\nUpdate - 20 hours in-game\nWell, I have ranked up in-game and have several Tier IV ships. All fun to play.\nReally enjoying playing the DD class since taking out unsuspecting BBs is fun as heck. Going into an artillery/torp duel with other DDs and CLs is fun as well. Kill or be killed.\n\nPlayerbase continues to be small, especially during the week days. Weekends are better and you will see the larger 16v16 battles. Competition mode is interesting when the playerbase gets larger.\n\nIs it 'fun'? Sure is and I haven't had to spend a single dime on the game. Don't think I will either since at this point it still feels like a 'beta' game and we need to see whether it grows. Its a nice change of space from War Thunder, Armored Warfare and World of Tanks. I needed the ocean scenery I guess. LOL\n\nDownload, learn it and give it a whirl. Its different so it will keep you entertained for a while. Just be aware that you WILL have to watch for the match making engine to generate a game. Play smart and be a team player...its what these games are about.

Just wish the same old same old money grubbing system for ship slots and such was not used. You are limited by the amount of equipment and ship slots you have unless you pump real cash into the game, but such is the nature of all "free to play" enterprises one finds.

You can decide how many ammo (HE, AP), planes (scout , fighters, tbombers, dbombers)  and special kits (repair kit, smokescreen etc)  bring on vessel.\n- Guns. You can shoot with all cannons on ship. 1st artillery, 2nd artillery, AA guns.\n- Air battle. You can change squads in battle. For example: You can start game with 3 groups of bombers, and later change formation. On next take off send 2 groups of fighters  and 1 group of bombers. CV are much better than WoWS.\n- GB technology tree\n- Submarines.\n- Dynamic gameplay. No time for boring\n\ndisadvantages\n- Ship controlling. Ships accelerates and stops too fast. Controlling is unrealistic. WoWS has betters ships behaviour.\n- Graphic design.\n- PC requirements. Game wont run on old computers.\n- Small community. (Sometimes I have to wait 8-10 minuts for battle)\n\nAnd one thing that can be plus or minus.\n- Battleships targeting system is very similar to WoT artillery.\n","February 8","true","423.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It only lacks an active large player base, so there are many matches 10v10 or less.\n\nCompared to World of Warships:\n*Speed and handling more realistic (no ice skating ships while turning)\n*Carriers require more skill and it is best to stay close to your heavy hitting Battleships.\n*Subs (which WoWs doesn't have) are just plain fun, and they are not overpowered. You will run out of oxygen, get chased by Destroyers, Cruisers, and Planes. You must also manage your limited torp supply. The deck guns are good on subs that have them.\n*Destroyers and Cruisers roles feel far better in this game. In fact it is recommeded that you play "with" your team and keep your ranges (radio, sonar, guns, spotting) in mind in relation to your team mates.\n*Large artillary gains accuaracy with follow up shots in the same general area.\n*The lack of pretty gfx that WoWs has is easily countered by the quality of the games mechanics.\n*Night matches with flares.

A good overall game but not as polished as WOW\n2. Very easy to pick and play and become effectiev in game\n3. Submarines are easy to play but difficult to master\n4. Good community\n\n\nCons\n\n1. Based totaly for NA\n2. High cost of some T4/5 ships. people without VIP(Premium) have the x.p for the ship but not enough Silver (Causing math making problems)\n3. EU playes can have long que times\n4. Fleet battle difficult to play for EU players\n\n\nOverall\n\nI enjoy playing the game and mainly play in the evening with MANY EU playes that are on. The overall ultimate part of the game which is to join a fleet and participate io the fleet battle is very difficutlf for the average EU player...the fleet battle are held twice a week and start at 02:00 AM in the morning for 2 hours.\n\nThe problem with this means that the average EU player that doesn't play fleet battle doesnt earn the points to upgrade their crew. so in about 6-7 weeks the gap will be so big on ships crew it will be difficult to play fleet battle.\n\n\nReccomendation to developers\n\n1. Either open a EU server or cater for your EU clients (i understand this may cost and licence problems) see option 2\n2. change fleet battle system to take into consideration EU fleets. 19:00 - 21:00 GMT ish\n\nRegards\nTMTC\n\n\n\n\n","December 2, 2015","true","155.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Also the ability to control your Artillery, AA, Depth charges, and Torps' make it more intresting to play.  By the way, there isnt a marker on the Torps' that tells you where to aim, you have to use the ol' school "Kentucky Windage" technique.\n\nOverall in the little time i've played this, I can say that im realy impressed.

I've play it till Tier 5 and I am still hype for more. I main battleships and still having lots of fun no matter win or lose. Its a really fun game and i'll rate it 10/10, I've could have rate it 11/10 but there is few downside to this that and needs improvement.\n\n*We need more PLAYERS to play! 60 players online = average of 2mins waiting.*\n\n-Overwhelming the battleships is a really good pick to play but I also prefer submarine as they can go undetected and attack battleships like there is 1 rock hitting 2 birds.\n-There is too many players using battleships (Including me). Aircraft carrier is a good choice as well because of the differents of type of planes that can be choose to battle.\n-Overall the controls are awesome, the gameplay is sick and people... STOP TELLING THEM TO MAKE A BIGGER MAP. BIGGER MAP = 20mins of traveling! Get your fact straight as I've encounter lots of this nonsence..\n\nPlease invite your friends to play! It will be lots of fun I can assure that and if you don't find the controls good. Well, why don't you try a REAL ships huh. This game has just launch not long ago and there is lots of room for improvement! Help to develop this game guys!\n\nAND REMEMBER!

Highly recommended for anyone wanting some WWII naval combat action. The graphics aren't particularly pretty, but the gameplay is fantastic.\n\nI feel the UI for managing your ships' officers could use a bit of work though, but aside from that, all of the other issues I've had with the game have been niggling at worst.\n\nThere's a huge amount of ships to choose from, and judging from the patch notes, they're continuing to add more. Furthermore, all of the ships seem to be relatively balanced in the sense that DDs don't feel inferior or superior to BBs since they serve a different tactical function. Also, in combat with each other, torpedoes hurt...  a lot.\n\nAlthough I haven't played much, the matchmaking system seems really good. As opposed to players being divided purely by ELO, they're divided by ship classes. So, both sides will have the same number of DDs, SSs, CVs, etc... which makes a HUGE difference given that every ship class has its own inherent strengths and weaknesses (you will never have the horrible fate of a full team of SSs vs BBs/CVs).\n\nAll in all I'm glad I found out about this game and am looking forward to seeing it get updated.","December 14, 2015","true","8.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

An while I enjoy Steel Ocean a bit more, there is some aspects of both games that if both were able to join forces they would make a game that was seriously bad a$$.\n\nPros:\nTorpedo Control is ALOT better then WoW.\nShips respond faster to controls.\nSubmarines!\nMore Playable Nations\nShip Classes have a different range of Tactics and forces a team to WORK AS A TEAM.\nEasy to grind EXP on lower levels.\nAnti Aircraft Gun Control **BANG BANG BANG** DIE DIRTY FLYING EARTHLINGS!\nBetter Carriers then WoW and Squadron Management.\n\nCons:\nGraphics are not as pretty as WoW\nConsumables are partly useless.. mainly smoke and COST ALOT of silver for basic things like repair, flood damage, fire control.\nAlot of the aspect of decorations for ships, camo, converting EXP cost gold which supports devs are more interested in making money for players at higher levels.\n\nOverall I enjoy this game, cause it has aspects of the game that are simply better then WoW. While I tried to get some of my other WoW friends to play it, they weren't as impressed to keep playing as I was. Seriously if the Devs joined forces with Wargaming WoW team and made a baby it would be a awesome experience and lay all other WWII Warship games to waste.\n\nTry it out.. just can't promise you will stay on it for long.\n","December 16, 2015","true","9.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Of course, some of that was studying controls, ships, commanders, etc. Well, was frustrating my first day. Cursing was not an issue for the first hour or so, then all of the sudden everyone started getting censored in chat. Even innocuous words! Okay, we're not all 7 year olds. Oh, well. Maybe it's because I report a couple guys for flaming people it got turned on. IDK.\n\nAnyway, today some very nice people clarified several things for me and I found myself REALLY enjoying this game. I was thinking about WOWS but those devs somehow got ahold of my xbox live account and literally spammed my email about playing on xbox live "again". I NEVER linked that account. So glad Steel Ocean came along and I finally found it. Just a great game. Sure microtransactions and gold requirements are a bit high, though I'm not sure I want to use gold on anything. Turns out you can earn 500 gold in game. (Side note: some of my gold disappeared and I've heard that others have lost gold, too.)\n\nMake sure you also search for the Steel Ocean Repulse package so that you can play challenge events (You're gifted the repulse which only has artillery equiped). Level 5 ships can play Challenge mode, too. It's REALLY fun, but I did awful in it save one round where I didn't miss a single salvo on the Dominator, yet he still managed to take out 12 of our ships by the end of the round even though he had next to nothing in health (I lost only 1 ship.\n\nAnyway, I've played this game until my brain got all cheesy today, so this review probably seems a little muddy. Oh, well. I so want everyone to play this game. So much more fun than I ever had playing WOT or WT.","February 8","true","139.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You don't have to spend a single nickle to enjoy it. Graphics are good. Sound is fine. Playerbase is rather small right now, which is unfortunate since some of the matches will end up 5v5.\nMany people compare it to World of Warships.\nI would recommend downloading it and giving it a whirl. You might find you like it.\n\nUpdate - 20 hours in-game\nWell, I have ranked up in-game and have several Tier IV ships. All fun to play.\nReally enjoying playing the DD class since taking out unsuspecting BBs is fun as heck. Going into an artillery/torp duel with other DDs and CLs is fun as well. Kill or be killed.\n\nPlayerbase continues to be small, especially during the week days. Weekends are better and you will see the larger 16v16 battles. Competition mode is interesting when the playerbase gets larger.\n\nIs it 'fun'? Sure is and I haven't had to spend a single dime on the game. Don't think I will either since at this point it still feels like a 'beta' game and we need to see whether it grows. Its a nice change of space from War Thunder, Armored Warfare and World of Tanks. I needed the ocean scenery I guess. LOL\n\nDownload, learn it and give it a whirl. Its different so it will keep you entertained for a while. Just be aware that you WILL have to watch for the match making engine to generate a game. Play smart and be a team player...its what these games are about.

However once you start to get the hang of it and playing as a team and not a solo attacker this game is a blast and each kill is really rewarding.  The events are a really nice change of pace and their are about 6 different playing modes that you are randomly thrown into.  It's no suprise that World of Warships is spending lots of money on advertising since this game has come out. This game is free to play and really isn't pay to win.  Money might help you level your ships faster but really doesn't help you in game at least not that i've seen. I highly recommend this game.   If you find a good fleet (fun and cooperative) this game is really really fun.  Oh and yes their is subs... :)  It has its faults, in game voice chat doesn't work.  General chat is like WOW Barrens chat.  Servers can be sketchy at times.

In November, like many other people, I liked the gameplay and the many features already in the game, but found the graphics and the ship handling not very appealing. I now see that the developers have worked on this. The graphics are much nicer, and there are already (slight) differences in how ships handle (turn, accelerate, decelerate).\n\nI appreciated that the developers didn't go overboard in marketing like Wargaming does. The latter company has been very competent in maximising short-term revenues (another premium ship "special offer", lol), but continues to disappoint many players with balancing issues and lack of content. The developers behind Steel Ocean seem to be doing a good job working behind the scenes, constantly ameliorating the game, without making a song and dance about it.\n\nI find this game to require more skill than WoWs, and that has a bearing on the people playing here. Some monkeys, but by far not as many as on WoWs... Quite a good number of Navyfield (1) veterans on here, too.\n\nOn the whole, an interesting game that I will continue to play.\n\nAnd fleet battles are SUCH fun!!!","January 3","true","22.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The second thing I noticed is that it had long, boring and unnessicary tutorials.\nThis brings me onto the gameplay... It's terrible. It is literally a unmistakable copy of Wargaming's two best F2P MMO shooters. It has the idea of World Of Warships, but the gameplay of World of Tanks. Which, in this case, makes me feel sick. It is clunky, slow and that drops me onto the final part of this mini-review.\nThis game is poorly optimised. I have a bad computer, yes.

So skip it. In short, this game went from 3k players in november to 200-400 players a day. No advertisement for the game, and a Software Developement Kit available to some random (cheating) players made the playerbase left the game en masse in last december. Since then, its now horrible waiting time (no more cheat yet, but the harm was done) and silly matchmaking.\n\nSo, obviously, wrecked matchmaking with indecent waiting time kills all the fun past (and including) tier VII. And it can also happen in tier III/IV, so prepare to have a book, or alt tabbing browsing internet while trying to watch in the corner if the match launches... AFK matches ahead...\n\nYou should not spend a single penny on this game, but give it a try if you want, it still free.\n\n\n\nModif: So after 800+ hours playing this game, and see it dying days after days (no efforts from dev team to advertise it, strange banhammer on in game chat without warning nor explanations), i decided to uninstall it once and for all.\n\nDont get me wrong, you will find a very nice gameplay if you play this game, there is good content to play for hundred of hours of PvP fun...

I have played WoWs for since closed beta and it was ok, but then I tried this game and it really took off for me.   What can I say.  It has subs, it has manual AA,  manual Secondaries.  The planes have fuel so they can not hover over your poor dd like in WoWs.  The planes can easily be destroyed using manual AA, unlike in WoWs where you can fire at them for a minute and be lucky to shoot down 2 of the 6.  The rng is more forgiving here when you fire.  The mm is a little weird as you can get in a match with a sub with all subs sometimes and no dds or you can have a dd and get in a game with no subs., but I figure the will work that out soon.  I would give this a 9.5 out of 10 if i could.  The graphics on ultra look good and the detail on a sub is amazing.  People say that the graphics are not as good here, but I do not see a difference much between the two games.  I will not be playign WoWs much if at all anymore.   Also, when you buy a 3000 gold pack with wows you get the 30 days and then enough gold for 1 ship port, here you get 30 days, plus enough gold to buy 4 port slots.  I think that they need to lower the premiums ships by like 10 or 20 bucks, but that is ok.","November 14, 2015","true","270.2"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

The waiting times for getting into games is like 4-5 minutes, at leaast with the games Ive had. And the match times are pretty quick, too. Again, Ive had around 3-5 minute matches with the waiting times. The only way Ill recommend this game to anyone is if they havent played World of Warships. Basically the same game with much prettier graphics, 2 second waiting times, and longer games, with a firing mechanic that doesnt just work off of luck, like world of tanks. Plus, if youve EVER played world of tanks, Youll realise something. THIS IS A CARBON COPY OF IT! Just with a naval skin over it! I will say this though, if it werent for the games unstable framerate of an unbalanced 15-50 fps on a GTX 970 paired with an Intel i7, and excrutiatingly long waiting times, I would play this more! But I cant get past how much of a carbon copy of World of Tanks it is! the ships move like theyre on wheels, rather than in water, they use the same firing system as World of tanks, they use the same advancing system as world of tanks, and in my personal opinion, world of warships is just a much more fleshed out naval combat game.\n\nTL,DR: Go play World of Warships, its more flesshed out, waiting times are non-existant compare to this, and, again, compared to this its basically photo-realism. This game is just a world of tanks skin.","May 21","false","7.4"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","40","4","10","6","11"

The game as I said before is a thing of beauty. Great graphics, ambiance, etc. But, it is not free and while it appears that it is, in order to get to any real meat of course you have to pay. Gold, gold, gold begins to become the common mantra for anything. I should have seen this as it is obvious from all the screen areas to provide a quick hotline for your money. On top of that behavior problems are rampart and it appears that the immature jerks that love tk'ing just to cause trouble are not policed. As much as I loathe War Thunder you can still progress without a constant plea for more money and lame as it is, at least there is punishment for childish behaviour. One last warning, apparently one fleet from China, which bills itself as the best players are amazingly piggish,( stealing kills, team killing and not playing the game until all team mates are killed , so he can cash in on all the points at end ) and are not punished at all. So if you want to be taken advantage of , play your heart out for no gain while the subscribers wipe the floor with you, by all means waste your time.

The game as I said before is a thing of beauty. Great graphics, ambiance, etc. But, it is not free and while it appears that it is, in order to get to any real meat of course you have to pay. Gold, gold, gold begins to become the common mantra for anything. I should have seen this as it is obvious from all the screen areas to provide a quick hotline for your money. On top of that behavior problems are rampart and it appears that the immature jerks that love tk'ing just to cause trouble are not policed. As much as I loathe War Thunder you can still progress without a constant plea for more money and lame as it is, at least there is punishment for childish behaviour. One last warning, apparently one fleet from China, which bills itself as the best players are amazingly piggish,( stealing kills, team killing and not playing the game until all team mates are killed , so he can cash in on all the points at end ) and are not punished at all. So if you want to be taken advantage of , play your heart out for no gain while the subscribers wipe the floor with you, by all means waste your time. I can not play this anymore and will not return.","December 22, 2015","false","85.2"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

The subs at the early tiers so far feel rather balanced and no, you can't stay underwater for the entire match, and if you are damaged, diving and surfacing takes away health. Needs alot more spit and polish though before it can really compete with Wargaming (and by that I mean starting with proper english translations and localization for NA players, not just crappy Chinese google translate).\n\nBut it's always hilarious to see "FAIL" when you lose a match. Give it a shot, it can only get better. The game plays well enough (a helluva alot more hectic) and if you don't like it, just uninstall, it's FTP.","November 12, 2015","true","2.6"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

The aiming system in WOWS is much smoother Steel Ocean feels derpy... For example whenever you turn your ship it does not lose speed? (Wtf?)

Community of players is small right now, but there is potential. I enjoy the small, yet diverse classes of ships. I do hope they add marines to the ships for boarding action, or something involving amphibious operations. Developers have implemented want looks like a three strikes limit when it comes to any teamkiller, which boots the offender from the game for 24 hours. Not sure what happens to repeat offenders, so that is nice to take into account.\n\nHowever, the major flaw for this game for me is communications. Use of communication is confusing and you are not sure if people heard you, which would be useful for someone who plays with the carrier's scout planes or using smaller ships to scout out enemies. If there any developers reading this, please try and fix this issue. Make it easier for someone to notify their fleet members or a heirarchy for a would-be fleet commander to issue orders.\n\nAnother issue, not for me of course yet, is modifications. Sometimes I would rather take off the AA guns and put on more artillery cannons and you can't. You can only upgrade the slots with equipment you have researched, which is acquired in combat.\n\nOverall, I would give this a 7.5/10 and would recommend others to at least try this game before knocking it.","November 23, 2015","true","34.5"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

There are a bunch of pros and cons for the game, but overall its definitely an experience I quite enjoyed.\n\nPros:\n- Absolutely nothing like WarThunder, which is what I thought it would be based around, this game has similarities to WarThunder, but overall it's completely different, which is great, because WarThunder is probably one of the most trash games on steam, especially with the millions of microtransactions they expect everyone to buy\n\n- Great gameplay, not difficult to learn how to play, unlike warthunder, it is easy to get into, start playing, and join public matches, or private matches.\n\nCons:\n- Pretty laggy on some occasions, its not my computer or internet, I think the game is just handling poorly, which could definitely be improved upon.\n\n- Poor graphics, the graphics are pretty poor, even on high/ultra game settings, which is slightly dissapointing, even though the game would run considerably worse had there been better graphics.\n\n- EXTREMELY laggy multiplayer, this I expected, if the game ran poorly in the first place, multiplayer wouldn't be any better, another thing that could be fixed in the future.","November 29, 2015","true","0.5"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Very little if any slowdown on my low-mid range rig. People on here saying the graphics are bad make me lol. lern2settings.\n\nFun game, think Battlestations Midway with more detailed ships and no direct control of aircraft; instead you manually line up attack runs which requires a bit of skill. Instead of merely having main calibre and AA, often ships have sub calibre as well as torpedoes and depth charges.\n\nThe game has a very arcady phisics engine compared to real life. That being said, I would not play a fully realistic naval simulator online because I don't have the literal ALL DAY it would take for a single match. You want this level of arcady because otherwise there would be very little to do. People complaining about the physics engine are fools, in real life it would take battleships miles and quite a few minutes to turn around completely. Does spending the first ten minutes of a match turning sound fun? I didn't think so.\n\nCombat is about trying to predict where your opponent will be, and destroyers are nimble enough to dodge large calibres at long range. This creates a dynamic where submarines are excellent at hunting battleships and carriers, which have a range and firepower advantage against cruisers but whose weapons have difficulty hitting destroyers. Cruisers, however, are potent destroyer hunters because of their many accurate guns that have a range advantage. Finally you have destroyers (and light cruisers, to a lesser degree) who excel at submarine hunting, but whose main calibres are typically unable to damage ships classed cruiser and above. Destroyers have torpedoes, however, which can hit subs at shallow depth, and decimate any ship, as well as depth charges for antisubmarine duty.\n\nThis creates an interesting interdependence where destroyers and light cruisers act as scouts and spotters for battleships, and matches typically have these close range battles surrounded by long range skirmishers like battleships and carriers, who try and get hits in against the lighter ships. Once this phase ends, the side with scouts hunts down the remaining enemies. e.g. Typically a lone battleship will have a great difficulty against several destroyers, however victory is still possible with a cool head and good positioning. It would be a much different story, however, if it was a lone destroyer against two or three battleships. The balance in the game reflects reality without sacrificing fun simply by limiting the amount of larger ships on either side - you wont see 10 BB and 2 DD on a team, for example. Every ship has a role and straying too far from your duties is a detriment to the team. If the battleships on one side rush its GG for them unless the other team makes some fatal mistakes as well.\n\nIndividual skill plays a major role and is well depicted in the battles within your range bracket. In a fight between destroyers, the better captain can win by quite a margin in most cases, so you never feel like you're simply giving and recieving damage at predetermined rates merely waiting for one side to die after doing a certain amount of damage in return. There is no RNG either as all shots, even the dropped bombs and torpedoes from aircraft, are manually aimed. The only things that aren't are the machine guns on the ships and fighters who have AI to kill bombers and scouts. You even get manually controlled flak cannons on your ships, and if you dont use them because you have tunnlevision on the target and didn't notice the bombers coming in then you're going to end up spectating for the rest of the match. There is a real sense of danger during battle, as the slightest mistake can have serious consequences, and no ship is more than one solid volley from a battlship or one spread of torpedoes away from going down.\n\nOverall this game has been quite enjoyable so far and for the low price of free, if you haven't downloaded it already you may be showing early signs of a rare form of alzheimer's that causes you to forget how awesome WW2 naval battles are. If so, download this game and go to a doctor.","March 31","true","141.0"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

After this is done, your enemy BB's and CA's are blind.\n\nSubmarines are scouts too. They are also terrifying to BB's that are defenseless against them.

Their Secondary Job is to Kill UNSUPORTED Submarines (See above). DD's will get the occasional kill against lighter ships, but they should not charge in.

You can play ships from 6 different countries. U.k with 27 different ships, 2 of which are bought with gold. Japan with 51 ships 10 bought with gold, Germany with 28 ships 3 bought with gold, United States with 40 ships 4 bought with gold, China with only one teir V11 ship only bought with gold and  France with its one teir V111 ship bought with gold. Gold in this game is real money. So if you plan on playing this game alot you are most likly going to throw down some real cash at some point. And things could depending on what you want get pretty spendy with $1.01 = out to 500 gold and as you get higher in your teir the prices go up. And with Ship expantion slots costing gold as well as paint jobs and flags for your ships even ammunition. You can start to see what I mean. Over all Not a bad game. Graphicly speaking looks good sound and movment totaly fine. But a bit repetative sometimes. there are about 5 maps maybe a couple more. I never counted. I have played for over 70 hours and probably only spend $50.","May 22","true","89.2"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

It's simple:\nNO EU SERVERS!!\nI get really bad connection on the North American server, with horrible lag, even if my fps is steady at 60.
