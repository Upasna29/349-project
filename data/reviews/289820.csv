Yes. Is the story good? Oh yes. Should you buy this game, here on Steam? No. Read on to know why.\n\nThis game is a dumbed down, simplified version of the original. This is not the original Dracula 2 - lots of puzzles and fun aspects of the game are missing. It's a dumbed down version of Dracula 2. Some quest items are missing also, ultimately cut out to make game simpler.\n\nAside from this, graphic bugs are common, with items reappearing in places you take them. Also, I have encountered a bug where I have a duplicate stuck in my inventory permanently because I managed to take it two times from the same place.\n\nDo yourself a favor and find an original version somewhere else. Steam Dracula 2 has most interesting and fun content cut off from it. Why did this happen? Your guess is as good as mine. I played both Dracula and Dracula 2 games over a decade ago and you would do yourself a huge favor if you find the original games (though I don't guarantee a smooth run on newer Windows systems)\n\nLastly, I did not notice any major cut content in the first re-released Dracula, and I don't understand why they have to cut so much content from the second game instead.

I cleared this version in just over two hours, so it's certainly doable.\n\nI'll get to my negative review in a bit, first some good points about the game need to be said.\n\n- Great classic p+c\n- Classic puzzle completion style\n- Longer playtime than the first game, 2-3 hours.\n- Satisfying storyline\n- Introduction of 'timed' puzzles\n\nOk that's about it - and I would give this game a recommendation, only problem being that this isn't a PS1 game port.\nThe steam version of the game is a port from the phone version of the game, not the PS1 classic. There's no real reason for this at all, it means the graphic detail is far removed from the first, there's missing cutscenes, loads of missing items - the game play suffers massively for it, the puzzles are 'simplified' some of them are missing entirely to make the game easier, and considerably shorter. - It's pretty buggy, making it far more linear than the PS1 version, which may be why some people who are using PS1 walkthroughs are getting stuck - it's entirely completable, which is a releif considering some of the steam games from meridian4 are not. I can't recommend this game simply because the price does not reflect the quality of getting a crappy phone game port.\n\nIf this were a PS1 port it would be so worth it - but do yourselves a favour, and get a hard copy. I just found some on ebay going for around £3, cheaper than the steam price. I picked this up in the recent meridian 4 sale, which is probably the only time this would be worth it.","August 18, 2014","false","5.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

I never played this one, and now I remember why.\n\nLike the steam version of #1, this is a port of a port of a port of a remake. And it shows.  It's buggy, ugly and boring. I have only managed to get about 30 minutes into this game (albeit over several attempts) then I ran out of steam either due to a bug that I would have to hunt on the internet to fix or just because I fell asleep.\n\nIt is a point n click in the old format, so if you love them then this game is for you. I find it boring, not scary at all (seriously 5 nights is actually more scary and I use that game to fall asleep if I can't get to sleep otherwise), the story is lacking and the graphics look like they are 16 years old (to be fair they would have been fairly good back then). Don't get me started on the acting, but think high school ... make that elementary school (K to 8) level.\n\nIf you want the original version head over to GOG and grab it.  If you want this wonky version grab it in a bundle or at 90%+ off. It's $5.49 CDN and I can say I got at most $0.55 worth of fun out of it.\n\nTo be fair I can see that this would have been a decent game back in the day.  If you have find memories of it and can get this cheap, give it a try.  You may get luckier than me with the bugs and actually enjoy your play time.\n\n\n1¢ Review Pro:\nVampires\n\n\nCon:\nWeak Story\nDated Graphics\nBuggy\nOverpriced for a 16 year old game\n\nOverall: 5/10 -1 Story, -1 Buggy, -1 Price = 2/10\n","May 29","false","1.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
