Where Lemmings had you actively trying to avoid dangerous situations by guiding your dim-witted charges through a number of obstacles to a designated exit with the aim of minimal loss to life, Life Goes On takes the exact opposite approach when it comes to reaching a levels exit. In Life Goes On sacrifices for the greater good are going to need to be made and thankfully you have an arsenal of brave knights at your disposal who are ready and willing to throw themselves off cliffs, into spikes, don’t mind being sawn to pieces, catapulted out of a cannon or fried to an electrical crisp.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=465748745\nThe whole concept of Life Goes On is to kill, maim, fry or set fire to those who are brave enough to accept your challenge and then use their dead bodies to solve a myriad of puzzles. Since death is a tool and not a punishment in Life Goes On, the death of one knight soon becomes the salvation of another...but not for long however. It’s an engaging concept made even more morbidly fascinating by the fact that each level has a recommended body-count counter. Come in below the recommended counter and you will receive commendations, go on a knight killing spree and you will receive a slightly caustic comment before being moved onto the next level. While the games puzzles (51 levels in total that range across three different areas – mines, mountains and a castle) are not particularly difficult – even though some of the later late game levels do become head scratching affairs – it does become a rather fun exercise trying to ensure that you complete a level with as minimal a body count as possible.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=465748946\nLife Goes On also includes a rather ingenious check point system represented as blue orbs throughout each level which are activated by simply touching them. Should one of your knights die the next knight will be automatically spawned from the last activated orb. These orbs often become puzzles in their own right and things can often get very tricky if you find you need to backtrack or try your best not to activate some of them in order to succeed. If I have a few gripes with Life Goes On is that some puzzle elements are used repeatedly which removes some of the challenge. Also for a puzzle platformer the game is not particularly challenging and is incredibly short and can be completed in 5 hrs or less depending on how you approach each level. For the most part though, Life Goes On sets out to achieve its goal through sly humor with a deliciously dark twist and often ends up succeeding admirably.\n\nFor seasoned puzzle enthusiasts Life Goes On will probably offer up very little challenge beyond what some will see as more of a gimmick that is never truly fleshed out enough to warrant a recommended purchase but for those of you who don’t take your gaming too seriously should find that there is more than enough here for you to enjoy and mull over while you plot your next knights demise. Just make sure you stay for the games end credits...you won’t regret it.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this review please follow my curator group at:-\nCurator Rater","July 21, 2015","true","6.3"," 54 of 56 people (96%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","96","54","56","4","9"

The puzzles themselves vary a bit in terms of difficulty but once you get a grip on the mechanics I don't think you'll ever get frustrated to the point of giving up.

I knew it wasn’t just the morbid nature of repurposing your corpses as puzzle solving tools, bizarre and unsettling as that is. And it wasn’t that there was something wrong with the puzzle themselves, because even with this odd feeling swirling around inside of me I was having a grand time solving them.\n\nWhen I finally figured out what had been bugging me, it was both surprising and a little amusing. With how deeply the concept of death has been incorporated and mechanicalized in games, and then instilled in me through years of playing them, I realized Life Goes On felt off because it was doing precisely the opposite of what I’d been trained to do above all else: stay alive. With how many countless grotesquely violent and gore fill games I’ve played I’ve become rather horrifyingly numb to using violence as a mechanic against others, but through all of those keeping myself alive was always the objective above all else.\n\nTo do otherwise in most games is to effectively stop playing. Death is simply failure by another name, often meaningless but nearly always present and in some cases even romanticized as one of a game’s most notorious traits (Dark Souls being an obvious example). Life Goes On asked that I rethink the concept of death and in doing so it made it mean something again. Each time one of my knights died I felt an odd mixture of joy at being able to move forward, and distress at the very thought I was taking pleasure from leading my character to the slaughter.\n\nWhat’s special about Life Goes On is that it doesn’t treat death the way so many modern games do. It’s not cynical, graphic, or intended to shock and appal you. It’s more like a cartoon where someone gets an anvil dropped on their head. Its situations are so absurd and everything drawn in such a delightfully cheerful tone, that I couldn’t take anything seriously because I wasn’t supposed to. Life Goes On recognizes how ridiculous its concept is and mostly manages to come off as silly, maybe even hilarious to some, rather than disturbing.\n\nThe way this unorthodox view of death is then applied to puzzle designs helps make a tired genre feel fresh again. There are a lot of the usual devices at work here, be they buttons, blocks, or various hazards, but the way you interact with them with the help of your past failures makes them feel original and inspired. Spikes become walkways, freezing beams create pushable blocks, and sticking yourself in an outlet completes the circuit opening the door. With death being directly integrated into the game design, it also helps take a lot of the edge off of missing a jump or screwing up a sequence, which removes most of the frustration so typical of the genre and had me playing through the entire game in just a few extended sittings.\n\nI realize I’ve sort of come full circle with this review, beginning with how Life Goes On made me remember that death isn’t just a meaningless game of numbers, but then arriving back at how I enjoy its mechanical use here. Ultimately Life Goes On has its cake and eats it too, so any attempt to make it out to entirely subvert the usual violent video game trappings would be dubious at best. But that it made me consider all of this, with seemingly no intention and while delivering an excellent puzzle platformer, feels like at least a modest accomplishment. It got me thinking about things I never even recognize in most games, and though it didn’t quite go all the way, it started a discussion and even managed to have a lot of fun in the process. Odd praise to be sure, but it’s a rather odd game itself isn’t it.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzvrAZ7k61g&ab_channel=MrNinjaSquirrel\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].\n","May 18, 2015","true","2.1"," 27 of 29 people (93%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","93","27","29","3","0"

See the resemblance ? Well, they're clones, but not in a traditional way. Each knight is given a random name to make you think you're dealing with other persons here. But they don't fool me. It would've been nice if every now and then a knight would get different equipment. Then, and only then, will I get the illusion that I'm dealing with different persons here. But it's not important, so let's just drop it.\n\nAnyway, you have to use your dead clones to make it past the levels. See spikes but can't cross ? Just jump in the middle of it and you'll be able to jump on that guy's head with another knight. The game starts with basic puzzle platforming but halfway through becomes more difficult when it throws other puzzle elements your way. It never becomes frustratingly difficult, as long as you pay attention. I got stuck in a level or two and in hindsight they were actually very obvious. So it also depends on the person eventually. The game isn't very long and you should be able to finish it in 2-3 hours max, depending on if you want to earn all of the available medals.\n\nThe graphics aren't great, they are actually pretty simple but they get the job done. I personally thought it lacked a bit of personality. The voice acting is also very basic, with only a scream whenever a knight dies. The music on the other hand is better than expected and I enjoyed it very much.\n\nThe last 2 levels of the game (the true last level and the credits level) are the most impressive levels and it's unfortunate that the other levels are so static in comparison (even if some of the puzzles are harder). If there ever will be a sequel I sincerely hope they'll make use of more platforming, just like those last 2 levels. Or maybe a combination of both, who knows ?\n\nLife Goes On is an enjoyable puzzle game and if you liked The Swapper I'm pretty certain you'll have fun playing this one, too.\n\n[Rating: 75/100]","April 24, 2014","true","4.5"," 19 of 21 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","19","21","0","0"

The idea that you need to die to use your own corpse to get through a puzzle is really cool. Most of the puzzles force you plan a few steps ahead to strategically die in one spot to use that corpse later. The puzzles hit a sweet spot where they're not so tough that they leave you crying in frustration, but are hard enough that you'll need a few tries to see the solution, giving you a solid sense of satisfaction when you do solve it.\n\nThe game has a lot of charm and great sense of humour. It's pretty self-aware of how morbid it's core concept is and takes more than a little delight in punishing the main characters over and over again. I laughed out loud a couple of times.\n\nMost players will finish the game in a single night, which is fair value for the price. I like games in which you can have a full experience in a single sitting. In that sense it reminds me of Thomas was Alone and similar indies. Each level has extras challenges and a target number of deaths needed to get to the end. I found myself replaying levels to try different tactics to avoid piling up bodies as a brute force solution to a puzzle.\n\nThe only complaint I have is that jumping feels a little loose at times. There's a particular sequence with ice blocks that I felt held me up because I had trouble sticking my jumps, not because I hadn't solved the puzzle. Beyond that, it also feels like the game shows you most of its ideas around 75% of the way through. Even so, I suggest sticking it through to the end because the final level for each world is epic and a great example of using level design to tell a story.","May 16","true","0.7"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","9","10","0","0"

Instead of trying to not die, you strategicly die to use the corpses of your fellow knights to make bridges, press buttons & trigger traps so that one knight may complete the mission. The gameplay is straight forward but doesn't lack it's complexity (especially later on in the mission list). Each mission has a time goal, life goal and a chester goal (finding a monster in the environment which will eat the knight and then sleep) which adds a lot of replayability as it isn't easy to hit all of these on the first attempt. The music & art makes for a humorous game which partnered with the gameplay is well worth the price.\n\nOne of the best mechanics is the "name" of the current knight which is usually pretty crazy (i.e. High Royal Knight Sir Edward The Grey) and gives each knight a bit of uniqueness and adds to the humor of these prestigious knights being used as sacrafices to trigger traps and make human bridges.

Who sits around a table and says, "Let's make a game where you use corpses to progress?" I mean, if you pitched it to me, I'd tell you it's a silly idea. But someone did it. And it works - quite well.\n\nI am really enjoying Life Goes On. So far, I've spent around 3 hours with it, and I've finished a third of the game. You will finish it quicker, but I am a completionist so I'm trying to get the fewest deaths and the fastest times, and man, let me tell you it's not easy!\n\nThe concept of the game is actually quite sound, and the execution is pretty good. In Life Goes On, you need the corpses of humorously, randomly named characters to succeed. It's not necessarily the corpses of your failures (although it certainly can AND WILL be...) - sometimes you need to strategically die to buzzsaws, spikes, and other such things to trigger traps and switches so you can open a door, turn off a flamethrower, get to a higher area, or just finish the level.\n\nThe game only has one button - jump. (and of course, directional pad) There's no attack, or anything else. This doesn't get too boring though, because the graphics & music are quite nice. Also, the levels and challenges are varied enough that you aren't focused on the fact that you are just hitting jump the whole time.\n\nSpeaking of levels and challenges, they are relatively easy to complete, but difficult to master. The levels are relatively short, most under a minute and a half, so you move through them pretty quickly, and they feel differing on the types of puzzles involved. There are three 'worlds' total. The game itself is pretty forgiving, because you have unlimited knights, but you can replay each level to try and get the best rating on both time, minimizing your deaths, and finding Jeff.\n\nJeff. What do I say about Jeff? You'll meet this adorable looking fuzzball, wander over to pet him, and he'll eat you. Yup. You heard me. In every level. And just when you think you're safe... HE'S IN THE CREDITS TOO. Sorry. You'll have to learn to love Jeff.\n\nDon't forget about Jim. Who's Jim? Well, each time you die, the knight that spawns is randomly named (the name shows up at the bottom of the screen). Jim is quite prolific and has at least 40 family members (some variant of Jim or James), that have a random chance to spawn when you get a new knight. There's even an achievement for wiping them all out. Trust me, I'm working on it. Eventually, you'll take care of the problem at the source. There's an achievement for that too.\n\nAll in all, I highly recommend Life Goes On and think that if you like puzzle or platforming games, this is a must-buy, even at regular price (which I feel is quite reasonable). My only complaint with the game is that it is quite short, and I would have liked to see more out of it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/toddhunter/recommended/250050/","toddhunter","toddhunter","http://steamcommunity.com/id/toddhunter/","1216 products in account","Death. It has always been something that is best avoided in video games. Also real life would be the other main place. But as Life Goes On, an indie puzzle game by Infinite Monkeys shows, sometimes it can be used to solve environmental physics based puzzles.\n\nThe hook of this game is a little tricky to wrap your head around, but simple to understand once you see it in action. Basically you control an infinite number of little knights and want to get them to the golden chalice at the end of each level. To do so, you can respawn a knight whenever a death occurs and make use of the previous body to further your cause. For example, you might be faced with a spike pit which is too wide to jump over. In this case, simply jump a knight into the middle of it, respawn and use the lifeless body as a stepping stone to get to the other side (The game gives each character a name, but you'll never bother to read it).\n\nIt is a base mechanics that works extremely well. If you played the demo (and you should) you would quickly have got into the swing of using your minions to get a little bit further each life. It is clever and the initial levels make great use of the different possibilities the mechanic presents. Unfortunately, like a lot of clever ideas it runs out of steam far too quickly.\n\nLife Goes on just doesn't have enough good variety to maintain your attention. By the end of the first set of levels you will have had your fill of the different types of puzzles and so it is a let down that the next set is more or less repeating things all over again. The levels get longer and the challenges more difficult, but really the game is just chaining the same challenges you have already faced over and over again into growing chunks. Worse, whenever a new mechanic is introduced, it tends to lean more towards frustration rather than fun, especially when compared to the very solid base (trying to avoid activating respawn points is never a fun time).\n\nTo be fair, although the 3rd "world" on drags a lot, there are still a couple of memorable stages here and there. One in particular pays homage to a popular steam themed game and the "final level" in each group represents somewhat of a boss battle, that is much more fun to play through. If only these levels had been the norm, rather than the exception this review would be a lot more glowing. As it stands the game only shows glimpses of potential and innovation, perhaps a lesson for the developers next game (quality of puzzles over quantity please!).\n\nMixing it up is the set challenge of beating the clock and set number of deaths for each level. You will also have a "fuzzy" creature to find in each level which will eat one of your knights. While this promises diversity, the reality is it just means you are beating the level three times with a slightly different focus. Sadly there doesn't appear to be much scope for earning all three in one run consistently and there is seemingly no payoff for doing so anyway.\n\nThe rest of the package is well put together. The graphics are functional and the sound and music is nicely done. The menus work, but are a little uninspired (think ios style) and there is basically no story to drive you on. The environments are nice though and have a lot of good touches such as moving power cables. There isn't a lot of variety in the caverns, but later levels do at least provide a slightly different colour palette.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, the knights themselves are perhaps a little inconsistent as platforms (you'll often try to jump on one and "miss") but this isn't something you can't adjust and plan for and there is a very low penalty for failure. The controls in general are tight and it is nice that the game automatically "grabs" you onto other knights so this is nowhere near as fiddly as it might have been.\n\nIs there enough content for the asking price? I'd still suggest that there is, at a push, but it is walking a very fine line (looking at 4-5 hours I would think). The base game here is so solid that I highly recommend everybody tries it, but the lack of ideas means even the demo might just be sufficient (or waiting for a deeper sale might be the best option).\n\nSo ultimately a bit of a disappointment despite still being a solid game. But then, life always goes on.","May 8, 2014","true","9.5"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/revenblue/recommended/250050/","revenblue","Reven","http://steamcommunity.com/id/revenblue/","336 products in account","I first played the demo months ago and instantly fell in love with this game.\nThe full game did not fail to deliver.\n\nThe whole concept of (literally) standing on the shoulders of those who came before is presented wonderfully. See a deathtrap? Die on it, then respawn and walk on your corpse. Switch that has to be held down? Die so that your corpse falls on it, then respawn and walk past. Et cetera, et cetera.\n\nThe controls are a bit inaccurate at times, and will most likely leave you dying slightly more often than intended. Although since this game is all about sacrificing one knight to make a path for another, a few more corpses lying around aren't that much of a problem. (And if you're finding it difficult, a few more corpses aren't a problem at all.)\nThe puzzles are challenging but not frustrating, and make great use of switches, platforms, corpses, and checkpoints. The solution is always there, if you know where to look.\nThe music is unintrusive, yet amazing. It fits perfectly into the game. The sound design, too, is brilliant. Everything just works together really well.\nThere is tremendous replay value in this game, too. Times (and deaths) to beat, secrets to find, more knights to sacrifice... And if you want a quick game (or want to prune Jim's family tree further), there are no lengthy menus to keep you from killing knights. This is evident even in the demo. Ten minutes worth of content, and I had over an hour logged.\nThere's also a great (if morbid) sense of humour present. The knights' death cries are hilarious, the names are generally overblown (and if they're not, it's funnier), and the victory screens... well, "VICTORY is failure rounded up!" is just one of the possible messages to recieve upon finishing a level. And then there's the credits of the demo.\n\nIf you haven't played the demo yet, you should. Even if you know you want this game. The credits alone are worth it. Possibly the title screen as well. And if you're undecided, the demo is basically a slightly earlier version with less levels and slightly different graphics (mostly just checkpoints and the victory screen are different, really).","April 17, 2014","true","11.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

But not as you're used to. Sometimes Victory requires Sacrifice. Sometimes it requires a lot of Sacrifices. This platforming puzzler puts a new spin on how to solve puzzles. It's kinda like Portal! Except instead of using Portals to solve puzzles you are using your dead comrades.\nWhat I can't wait for are the mods and extra maps. If this game ever joins the Steam Workshop it will have so much potential. Not only will people be able to upload their custom maps, they would be able to upload specialty mods. Can I hear "After Life Goes On"? Imagine this game played with Zombies and Brains instead of Knights and Cups.

The game was developed by Infinite Monkeys Entertainment and was originally conceived at the 2012 Global Game Jam. The main aim of each level is to reach the golden cup, the holy grail so to speak. How do you do this with all the death traps you ask? Well its easy when your a king, with a portal and have an infinite number of knights to send to their deaths until you can accomplish your goal.\n\nIn Life Goes On, if you die that's not the end, instead you just send another knight through the spawn portal. This is not just a piece of gimmicky morbid comedy, it is in fact a core mechanic of the game. Sometimes having to sacrifice your minions is required to progress or solve a puzzle. An example of this is if the objective is across a floor of spikes, lay down the lives of your knights so one can climb across the hole ridden bodies to reach the grail.\n\nIn other platformers, you sole objective would be to avoid a deadly trap however in Life goes on, you may need to use that trap to accomplish your goal, perhaps you need to sacrifice a knight on a saw blade to strategically land the body on a button or build a mound of bodies to reach a ledge. What this means is that obstacles in Life Goes On are not just obstacles they become useful tools to use to progress.\n\nOverall Life Goes On is certainly a good platformer that provides a mix of enjoyment, comedy and challenge. The game provides a unique twist and this twist provides great synergy of the level design and mechanics. For anyone who loves the genre it will certainly cure that puzzler platformer itch.

Trine and Unmechanical didn't impress me, I liked, but was frustrated by, Little Big Planet, and I typically find the slapdash nature of these things frustrating, especially when there's a lot riding on success.  I favor the tight, precise controls and rapid-fire pace of a Super Meat Boy or VVVVVV or Braid.\n\nBut Life Goes On charmed the living pants off me.  Which is weird to say about a game when you send knights to their horrible deaths by the dozen.  But the game revels in the comic, chaotic morbidity of it all, encouraging you to impale, electrocute, or incinerate your way to success.  Death isn't frustrating because it's too busy being comical - and half the time, it's bringing you closer and closer to your aims, even when it isn't necessarily intentional.  The mechanics are clearly (and subtly) explained, and the puzzles get just tricky enough toward the end that I felt like a boss overcoming them - without ever relying too heavily on skillful platforming or punishing the player for misjudgements (the error most games of this kind tend to make).\n\nThis game isn't just underrated, it's a quiet masterpiece.  It's tonally brilliant, earnestly funny, challenging (but not punishing) and good fun from first to last.  If you were looking for the really great, weird indie platformer nobody's ever heard of but is a blast to play - this is it.","January 13, 2015","true","8.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It’s a heavily saturated market and because of this you need a stand out feature or gimmick in order to be successful. We’ve seen water manipulation, magnetism and some even let you wind back the clock. Life Goes On has chosen to use dead knights as its “gimmick”, using them as a platforming and puzzle solving tool. The problem is instead of using them as a standout feature and allowing for amazing puzzle design, it’s there for no more than a quick chuckle.","April 17, 2014","false","3.5"," 15 of 104 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","15","104","0","9"

I especially life the gold vs. purple ranks. This is one of the few games I've gotten really frustrated with my failures, and still not been able to put it down.\n\nBut the real icing on this razor blade cake is its personality, style, and dark sense of humor.

The game gets harder the further you come, and there are multiple solutions, hidden stuff and shortcuts everyhwere and you get rewarded for being smart and thoughtfull. The humor in the game is actually quite minimal and most of it only there at the very end.

"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197983662248/recommended/250050/","76561197983662248","TechieRefugee","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197983662248/","714 products in account","To start: I used to add a header to these reviews, but since it often made the review too long to submit, I've opted to leave the header on my Backloggery.\n\nGameplay: It's no secret at this point; puzzle-platformers are a dime a dozen in the indie marketplace. I think that may have been because of Braid, but I'm not sure. Now, I'm not going to say that this game is necessarily revolutionary in how it handles the puzzle-platformer setup, but it does at least do things a little more interesting than the average block pushing puzzle, even though there are some of those in here. You see, what this game does differently is that this game wants you to die. A lot. Yet, this game isn't anywhere near on the level of challenge as something like Super Meat Boy. How does all this work, you may ask? Through jolly cooperation! Also, the character kinda looks like Solaire, so that really does help matters.\n\nWhen you die, unless your corpse falls into a pit, it stays on the level. Ally corpses are the way to solve the puzzles in the game, as no puzzle (at least as far as I could tell) can be beaten with no deaths. Also, unlike a ton of other puzzle-platformers, this game strikes a perfect balance between puzzle and platformer (with the exception of one stage, Altered Trajectory which is both not a puzzle and the worst stage in the game IMO). Puzzles are fun to solve, and the platforming feels good. As for the controls, you run and jump. That's all you need, honestly.\n\nFor $12, this game does feel a bit short on content. Even going for 100% through the typical three-badge setup of these kinds of games (find hidden thing in level, beat it under par time, beat it with minimal deaths), this game only took me about four hours. Beyond that, I don't really see me playing this game all that much in the future. You can use your own price evaluations to determine how much this game is worth to you. A map editor would've been really nice,  but I think the same can be said for pretty much any puzzle-platformer. Apart from that, there really isn't much to talk about. It's a puzzle-platformer with some pretty nice level design that you can complete in one sitting pretty easily. Most of you will have gotten this from a Humble Bundle, as I did (the Humble Jumbo Bundle 2 IIRC?), so if you're looking for an opinion on this game, it's a good four or so hours. 9/10.\n\nStory: As far as the storyline goes, there really isn't anything to talk about. You are hunting for the Holy Grail, and there is quite a lot of corpses along the way for some reason. This game definitely has a good sense of humor; a very British sense of humor, in fact. If you like things like Red Dwarf and Monty Python, you'll feel right at home here. It's very silly, and the concept of killing yourself to win the game doesn't really stop getting silly. If the level design wouldn't keep me coming back, the humor would. 9/10.\n\nGraphics: A suprisingly good looking game for only being a ~200MB download. It's a very good blend of graphical fidelity and art style. Some of the levels do start to look a bit same-y, but considering that we're talking about the puzzle-platformer genre here, it's a considerable amount of praise to say that levels look a *bit* same-y. As for the technical aspects of this game, it fullscreens to your native resolution (a BIG plus in my books) on launch. Beyond that, there really isn't much else to tinker around with in the options menu as far as the graphical fidelity of the game goes. That's alright, though; the game never really phased my GTX 760, so I'd imagine most anyone with Intel HD Graphics at the very least would be able to run this game. Well optimized, it looks good, and it fullscreens to my native resolution. All the check boxes ticked for me. 5/5.\n\nSound: As always, there's two major things to talk about here: the soundtrack and the voice acting. The voice acting really only consist of death knells, which are as you would most likely infer by this point in reading this review, very silly. As for the soundtrack, some of the tracks are forgettable, but for the most part I'd say it's an above-average medieval-inspired orchestral soundtrack. It's fitting, but I'd probably never listen to it outside of the game. Just not my thing. There were a few strange audio glitches in which tracks would either layer over eachother in a really annoying way or just not play at all for a while. It didn't happen too often, though, so it's not too big of a worry. Anyways, the voice acting is silly, the OST is good but not too memorable, and the sound only bugs out once in a while. 4/5.\n\nOverall scores are: 9/9/5/4; cumulative score of 9.0/10. Again, your mileage may vary on the game's value. I'd personally wait for a sale before I would pick up this game, but if you're not strapped for cash or anything, $12 is a perfectly fine value. It's a better value than AAA games, that's for damn sure.","September 28, 2014","true","4.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I quite like this puzzle game, and it brings something new to the table as far as newer games go - you can use the corpses of your soldiers to complete levels and rise to new heights! As morbid as that sounds, the game is odd in that you don't really feel like you're killing anyone or anything after the first few levels; there's a scroll at the bottom of the screen that tells you the name of the poor soul you're controlling, but I found myself ignoring it (you go through knights fast in this game) until I wanted to get an achievement that involved dealing with members of a certain family.\n\nThe music is solid, and the levels are challenging. Every set of levels has new elements that you have to learn to manipulate, and it becomes quite the task to sort everything out while trying to be conservative with your knight numbers. The game is light-hearted, which says a lot all things considered, and is one of the better puzzle games out there. I'd definitely recommend this game, it really is a fun little thing.","February 21, 2015","true","17.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You have an unlimited number of lives, played a singly-control controlled knights making their way through the level toward a treasure.  As obstacles arise, you throw your knights at them in ways that invariably costs their lives in morbidly humorous ways to allow pasasage by their successors.  Each level also has par conditions to try to beat for time and lives spent and a hidden monster to feed a knight to for full completion.  The graphics and music are excellent.  The control is at times imprecise (for instance, using one knight as a platoform in a spike pit can be a bit finicky if it's not at a full-speed jump distance away) but manageable.  Good level design and a very charming style more than make up for it.","September 7, 2015","true","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
