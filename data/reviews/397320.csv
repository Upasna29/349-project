"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thendash/recommended/397320/","thendash","Thendash","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thendash/","305 products in account","CTU is obviously trying to be a successor to SWAT 4 and Rainbow Six 3. Which is great, we need a modern take on both games. Unfortunatly CTU falls short like all the other games that have tried.\n\nFirst of all, CTU seems to be using the default Unity character controller. This leads to "slippery" momentum based movement that feels just plain bad.\nIt ships with very few missions on top of the unskippable tutorial missions.\nPoor pathfinding caused my ai teammates to get stuck on closed doors while they tried to reach me on the other side of the building many times.\nSettings don't seem to save after closing and relaunching the game.\n\nIt's not all bad though. CTU has a few features that would have been welcomed in other games such as Takedown Red Sabre.\nThere's career progression in the form of recruiting new officers and purchasing different equipment, including a shield which was missing from SWAT 4.\nThere's a map editor. So if a large enough community forms, the lack of official missions could be fixed.\nYou can lean while walking, and leaning causes your character to "step out" making it really easy to check a corner.\nCTU allows you to play a "run and gun" style, or a slower "no casualties" style, and rewards you more for arrests over kills. This is nice to see in a police themed game.\n\nOverall, there's a lot of potential here, but it's not worth it at it's current price and still needs a lot of work and polish. I would be a lot more hesitant to give this a thumbs down if it was an early access title. Keep looking SWAT players.","April 22","false","0.6"," 68 of 72 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","68","72","2","4"

The first of which I completed, with no exaggeration, in the space of about 3 minutes. The second mission is a bunch of identical rooms in what I guess is a hotel, there are dark tight corridors and when you use the flashlight you can see the terrible shadows everywhere. Honestly there's barely anything to play here even if you were to overlook all of the problems.\n\nVerdict:\nThis game is horrible and a waste of your time and money. I wanted to give it a chance, I love SWAT and Rainbow Six, I would have given this a positive review for sure if I derived any enjoyment whatsoever from it - I did not - in fact, I have to now ask for a refund. It was that bad.\n\n\n\n\n\n","April 25","false","0.3"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/th_pion/recommended/397320/","th_pion","th_pion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/th_pion/","283 products in account","CTU tries to create a similar experience to SWAT 4. Unfortunately it fails doing so for the most part. The game is not terrible and can potentially be fun with friends, but it's not the tactical shooter I was waiting for.\n\nMechanics:The game has a good variety of different mechanics (Snake cam, various grenade types, leaning). Unfortunately most of them are not very well implemented. This is especially true for the movement: It is "floaty" meaning that you continue moving after releasing the key (even in "walk" mode). In general the controls feels unresponsive and clunky.\n\nLevel Design:The level design is actually decent. You have multiple ways to go and different angles to cover. Potentially creating interesing tactical decisions. The biggest downside is, that there are only 4 different maps for the single player (+ 4 tutorial missions). There is a map editor in the game but it's in beta and is very bare bones. It has Steam Workshop integration however and a few people created maps already.\n\nAI:The AI is in my opinion the most important part for a tactical shooter especially the one for your teammates. Unfortunately this is the weakest part of the game. You can order your squad mates to either go to a specific point or to follow you around. The first option is very finnicky if you try to make them face a specific direction. When following they sometimes get stuck (on terrain or on each other) but it works for the most part.\nIt gets bad when you try to open and clear a room. Their positioning in front of a door is terrible. When you tell to "Open and Clear" they will make one step into the doorframe and engage the first enemy in sight (which is usually the one diagonally across) blocking line of sight for you. Sometimes they bug out and attempt to clear the room they were coming from (doing a 180° turn in the door frame).\nIf you give the order to "Open, Flash and Clear" they open the door (while not being in cover at all) and throw a flash greande in the room (which is ridiculously underpowered btw). If they don't see an enemy right away they will wait for the flash to go off and then attempt to clear the room. If they see an enemy though they will move into the room and try to engage him getting flashed by their own grenade.\nThe enemy AI is pretty bad as well and you get away with just run and gunning if you don't care for score (arresting people gives way more score than killing them).\n\n\nConclusionI think the game can be reasonable fun if you play it in co-op and restrict yourself to not play optimally and instead coordinate proper door breaches and stuff. The SP experience is very lackluster, though. Definitely not the game I was hoping for.\n\nMore details:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WkFO00b5Kg","April 28","false","3.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

One blatant example of this that you can use the “Interact” key to pick up evidence, but when you take down an enemy that key does nothing. You have to use the spacebar to get the sub menu to come up and then click on the option to report back to your central command that they are down or have been arrested.\nThen there are times when you shoot an enemy and they fly 10ft up into the air when they die before falling back to the ground. Not game breaking, more humorous than anything else but not something one would expect out of a finished product. One particularly annoying thing was that at times the AI would appear to surrender, only to go “Nope, nevermind” pull up their weapon and start shooting even though you had them dead to rights. It was bad enough that it made you just want to shoot any enemies rather than take the chance you’d get shot and not have enough health to take another hit before completing the map.\n\n\nI was unable to test out multiplayer as I never did find anyone else playing, so unless you and a few friends are going to go in on a few copies together, expect to play this solo.\n\n\nEven with the things mentioned before however, you could play the game and potentially have fun doing it. Visually it was OK but not an awesome looking game, and it is not all that fast paced, which one shouldn’t expect from a tactical shooter anyway, but the real game-breaking thing for me was that it never seemed to save my profile. Once I quit the game and would come back to it later none of my progress was saved and I would have to start from square one all over again. None of the upgraded weapons or gear I purchased, no extra guys on my squad, nothing.\n\n\nThe developers for the game are active on Steam from what I could see and are publishing regular updates, so it is possible that after more time in development and continued improvements that the game could become better and maybe at some point even worth the asking price.","May 28","false","3.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","2"

A long time after I'll update my review.\n\nPositives\n+ The game is in active development, meaning things are still being fixed\n+ In Game Editor works well\nNegatives\n- Movement feels really tanky, this is more noticable at lower fps' but its also slippery\n- The Campaign is really short.\n- AI Officers are useless. and all can die to a single guy\n- It's hard to tell who you've called in, I'd prefer this part to be automatic after you kill someone or arrest someone as this can cause you to lose minutes if it glitches and doesnt complete or more likely you get distracted\n- It didn't feel like I had to use any tatics.\n- Low lighting situations look really bad for some reason.\n\nHow I played this game: Shoot anyone who points a gun at you.  Shoot anyone who doesn't put down their gun on sight.  Dont care about evidence.\nNever hire extra officers.\nNever change your equipment.  All you need is your two guns and you're set.\n\nSuggestions\n1. More missions, maybe a cohesive plot or something.  A narrative is always nice in a game.  Because at the moment this game reminds me of a flash game called Sierra 7 which I'd say actually had a BETTER story than this and while on rails and all stick figures worked really well.  And was free.\n2.  At the moment there's no real community forming around the game, I'd point this at the fact the game itself isn't great and doesn't inspire much.  Hault work on the level editor for now, detail the levels more, as frankley the models aren't bad but it feels too clean, add decals, more models make it feel more alive.\n\nReally this game feels like it's more early access than completed.  It really lacks that polish you look for in these games.","April 22","false","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"
