You spend more time playing and foraging than you do trying to figure out how to play the game - which is good.\n\nThe soundtrack (which appears to be 2 tracks only), is EXCELLENT - and goes well with the flow and feel of the game. There a few small annoyances, but it IS and EA game and that is to be expected.\n\nI look forward to whats coming, well done DEV's.\n\n8/10","February 24, 2015","true","1.9"," 39 of 52 people (75%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","75","39","52","5","5"

Simple gameplay mechanics, plenty of updates due, very minimal bugs in my entire playthrough, I only encountered one which restarting the game fixed, friendly developers that listen to the community and of course an interesting game to begin with.\n\nIf you're a fan of open world games, pixel graphics, point and click mechanics, great music, killing animals and eating them, then jump right in.

For example:\nThe game wouldn't let me combine sticks + rock to make a trap. Kept tryng until it worked.\n\nI put a log on top of a rock in my crafting window thinking it would replace them item, instead I couldn't move or do anything and had to restart the game again.\n\nYour inventory is too small to really be useful.\n\nInventory screen is frustrating, often opens and blocks your view.\nFor instance When i was trying to set a trap, the inventory screen kept opening, took many tries to actually set it.\nIf you actually manage to set a trap, you don't catch anything anyway, I had 6 traps (many tries just to set one) that were all empty all the time. In my total game time, I caught one rabbit.\n\nItems on top of items, you often do something besides what you wanted to do. Like foraging, but instead you chop down a tree, because the two are too close together and trees have a large hit box.\n\nOn my 5th game (1st few games were too bugged to keep playing), I couldn't set a trap for the life of me, after trying for 5 minutes I gave and I also gave up on this game as well.\n\nThis game is more of a lesson in frustration then anything else.","July 14, 2015","false","1.0"," 35 of 51 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","35","51","0","1"

I also got really focused on finding foxes and forgot to eat. I had plenty of food, but then I "starved to death" and another save file of 5 hours was deleted. I understand it's trying to be realistic, you should think of this intuitively,  you should figure it out, etc. but forcing a complete restart after hours of tedious gathering and crafting just feels like a slap in the face.\n\nAlso, the UI is clunky and annoying. So many times I frantically tried to forage an item, only to shoot an arrow or chop a tree or lay a trap. And I'm not sure if this was intended or not bug if you put obsidian on the ground, it disappears. You'd have a tool tip telling you what an item was, but you'd end up grabbing another item nearby. It's annoying to use the last of your energy harvesting something only to be teleported back to your cabin without having had a chance to grab the item. I have some other complaints, but I just don't remember them all.\n\nEdit: And now the game froze and deleted (unpurposefully, I believe this time) my latest attempt of 3 hours. I usually attempt to complete everything in a game no matter how mediocre, but I think that's all for me today...","April 14","false","16.6"," 18 of 24 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","18","24","0","0"

I really loved it, on both computer and mobile version. The thing I hate about it is the BLOODY FOX! It's hard to find one, and VERY hard to catch one. I'm not complaining or anything, I'm just saying this game is HARD! But within 3 real life hours, I've thrived there, and gotten every single items in the list. I hope the owner of this game add more stuff to this game.\n\nHere are the list I wish the creator of "On My Own" have added.\n1. More animals\n-Hostile; Bears, wolves, badgers, skunks, snakes, bees (with beehives), Mountain Lions, etc.\n-Unhostile; Birds, Tuna, Forest Goats, Mountain Goats, etc.\n-Rare; Yeti (Extremely Rare, not hostile unless provoked), Sheep, Yak, Travellers (So you could trade with them, or even kill them for goods), etc.\n\n2. More Equipments\n-Craftable; Makeshift Rifle, Makeshift Netbag, Slingshot, Spear, etc.\n-Natural; Iron, Clay (can be used for cosmetics of camp), Rotting Leaves (so if you have berries, you can plant them instead of looking around for them.), etc.\n\n3. Rebuildable camp\n-Reason; It'll be very very VERY troublesome if your hunger is very low, and you're far away from your camp. So why not, make your own camp so you don't have to go back and forth to cook/get stuff from your camp.\n\n4. Enter your own base\n-Reason; It'll be boring when you only have a base just to save, and look at a map. So why not, make your camp so that you could enter it to look see what's inside. Also, like I said for Idea no. 2, "Clay (can be used for cosmetic of camp)", you could enter your house, and add in some cosmetics like flowerpots, or probably a workbench for you to craft even advanced items like the Makeshift rifle.\n\n5. WORKSHOP!!\n-Reason; It'll be great for people with big ideas to make new maps, new animals, new equipments, and new cosmetics of the game. Who knows, probably someone made your game a lot better than you might have.\n\nThat's all. I hope the creator of "On My Own" reads this. I will soon make video gameplay of this game in YouTube so it'll get more views on what is this game about. Other than that, really good game, and I wouldn't complain about the bugs and all in this game, because it's still a work-in-progress game. Bugs I've encountered are like duplicated item when you walk and look into your inventory, and when you try to cook while walking, your food vanishes. I hope the creator would do SOME of my suggestion to make this game better. If my suggestions seem to not fit with the game, please inform me.\n\nThat's all for today, thank you for reading! I 100% recommend this game to every survival game lovers. Overall, 98/100! Hope the creator reads this, and have a nice day!\n\nYour cute lil' creeper,\nSargeJr","August 9, 2015","true","4.4"," 18 of 24 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","18","24","0","0"

It's exactly the kind of game I like to play, and I did enjoy my first few minutes of wandering around. However, after about five minutes, I grew increasingly frustrated with the crafting/inventory UI, which appears above and below the player. I consequently found it difficult to move items from my inventory into the world – quite often, the UI was in the way. There was a clunkiness to the user controls in general – I felt like I had to focus entirely on figuring out how to actually play the game, and couldn't focus on the world itself. I played for about 20 minutes, ragequit, and requested a refund.\nMaybe one day I'll check it out again, because, aside from the terrible UI, the game itself seems really solid. There's definitely a lot of merit to this game, but in the end I didn't find the frustration worth it.","February 26","false","0.4"," 43 of 70 people (61%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","61","43","70","2","0"

The survival aspect of it isn't hard, and it's a very relaxing game. The controls are done well, and the graphics are very retro and simplistic. You can't get lost in the game because of markers on the edges of the gameplay.\n\nOverall the surroundings you're in are very simple, there are only a few elements (such as flowers, squirrels, rocks, sticks and trees) so there aren't too many combinations you can make. So far I have made two types of traps and caught animals in them (but not the fox yet), and I've enjoyed the game fairly well. It is worth the price and worth your time if you enjoy relaxing, casual, survival games.\n\nGraphics/HUD: 9/10\nGameplay: 6/10\n\nI'd give it a solid 7/10 if you're willing to fork over $5, and I look forward to updates in the future.","February 23, 2015","true","0.8"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","13","16","0","0"

With little fanfare, you’re thrust into the wildness, tasked with surviving on your own. The ultimate goal is to survive long enough to climb the mountain.\n\nOn My Own is dubbed a woodland survival adventure game by Beach Interactive and Close Studios. Released on Steam last month, the game is now making its way to iOS, Android, and soon consoles. Before I start this review, I’ll just mention that I personally know the designer and artist Kyle Weik. I hail from Fargo, North Dakota, where Beach Interactive resides. I’d talked to Kyle about the game for months before it released, so naturally I was a bit disposed toward liking this game.\n\nThat said, the subject matter itself was a natural draw. Ever since I was a kid I’ve gone camping with my family. As I got older, we did more extreme camping; I’ve been on about a dozen canoe and backpacking adventures over the years.\n\nAt an early age I fell in love with books like My Side of the Mountain and The Hatchet. I was also a Boy Scout, and trained in wilderness survival. Part of me has always longed to strike out on my own, to be alone in the wilderness with nothing but my wits and wisdom. While being marooned in the wilderness would obviously be a terrifying experience—especially for loved ones left behind—I’ve always wondered, Could I survive in the wilderness if I had to?\n\nI’ll likely never know the answer to that. While I’ll always have a love of camping, the modern world is such that it’s nigh-impossible, without immense sacrifice that I’m unwilling to endure, to just drop everything and go into the wilderness. I’d leave too many loved ones behind, for one.\n\nOn My Own (OMO), though, afforded me a few hours to think through that possibility. You choose the sex of your character, read a brief letter about why you’re going into the wilderness, and then you’re there. You have a cabin, a hatchet, and a backpack. With little guidance, the game forces you to trap and hunt your own food, sew clothing from hides, construct weapons and tools, and start and maintain fires.\n\nThere’s a fair amount of variety to the activities, but time moves quickly through the seasons, which adds a welcome challenge. Berries only grow in the summer. Plants, needed for making bows, are only available in the summer and fall. The winters are cold, limiting how far you can venture from camp before your energy is depleted.\n\nThe first couple winters were brutal for me. I didn’t construct a bow that first winter, and berries barely provide any energy. My hunger meter gradually decreased as the winter wore on: I wasn’t prepared, and I thought I might starve at one point.\n\nThe second summer I worked hard to gather the materials for a bow so that I could shoot a deer. But the bow broke as I hunted a deer. Then my second bow broke. The rabbits closest to my home were already harvested. I entered another winter unprepared.\n\nAs the game progressed through the years (playing a year takes about 40 minutes), I got better at surviving. Soon I had a surplus of food and rabbit skins. The game is a bit unbalanced at times, where you might gather a ton of certain resources and then lack other resources. And time can move a bit fast—both the length of day, and the number of days in a season (ranging from 2-4 days for each season) could be extended.\n\nBut for your money, the game is still a great adventure. There isn’t a lot of variety to the music, but the twangy banjo music is uplifting and never gets old.\n\nConflict is minimal. The need to eat is an ever-present drive, and occasionally you might get mauled by a bear (I learned right away how close I could safely get to the grizzly bear, and where that line was!). The game does not present nature as an enemy, or as something to fear. Nature simply exists, I alongside the myriad animals.\n\nHuman contact is minimal, but I never felt alone or lonely. I felt content, satisfied. Often while I played my breath with hitch and I would deeply sigh, relaxed, fulfilled.\n\nThe loading screens are peppered with quotes about the natural world. For example,\n\nSeeking means to have a goal; but finding means: to be free, to be receptive, to have no goal.\n~Herman Hesse\n\nThe game doesn’t hold your hand, and provides very few hints on how to craft new items. I resisted looking up a wiki how to progress. When I finally discovered how to make a longbow, one that wouldn’t break like my bundle bow, I felt so accomplished!\n\nIf you are looking for an end-goal, the game provides one in the form of different environments. You can camp in four landscapes, the last being the bleak and lonely mountain. Make it to the mountain and you “beat the game.” This is a game, though, where the destination isn’t as important as the journey. Any woodsman will tell you that being in nature, in and of itself, is enough.\n\nFor all the challenges those first two years posed to me, eventually I fell into a rut. Harvesting deer and rabbits became easy. I stocked up on berries, fish, hides, feathers, and wood. I accumulated so much that surviving was no longer difficult. As I played the game, I became complacent. I dared walk closer to the grizzly bears, knowing that even if they attacked me, it wouldn’t seriously set back my efforts.\n\nTo me, survival games are always most enjoyable in the beginning, when the danger is real. The first time I played Minecraft, back when it was in beta, I had no idea what to do. The first couple nights were actually frightening to me. I had no shelter, and I died over and over again by the slings of arrows from skeletons that I could not see.\n\nBut then I learned to build a shelter, mine iron, and craft weapons and armor. I started over many times in Minecraft, and the first few hours are always the most enjoyable. I eventually reach the point where I know how to craft everything, and the challenge is gone.\n\nBy the time I got to the third camp of OMO, I had so much stuff that I had nowhere to store it. I just left it on the ground, scattered around my lean-to. I had become rich.\n\nThe same thing happened to Sam Gribley in the My Side of the Mountain series, and Brian in The Hatchet series. The first books of those series are the best, when the boys are just learning how to survive. By the later books, they, too, become rich.\n\nAnd I suppose that’s the natural way of the wilderness. Even alone, you are truly on your own for only a very short time. Then you have your stuff as company.","March 26","true","4.7"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

There are survival elements, but far less stressful ones than say Dayz, The Forest or The Long Dark. It feel like the devs know what they are setting out to make and have a vision for the completed project, and although i've only played a short time, I feel like this will be a game that I come back to when im frustrated with my other survival games.\n\nCriticisms are minor\n-control options, let me bind my keys if i need.\n-UI needs a bit of tweaking.

Then I couldn't figure out how to bait the trap so my energy and hunger meters just kept rapidly falling lol. Good stuff. I like a game where basic functions are a complete mystery.
