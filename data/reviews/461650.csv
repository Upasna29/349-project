"It's Killing Time" is so bad, it's funny. I was actually laughing out loud at how much more ridiculous the story got with each passing chapter. It's hard to explain without revealing any spoilers. But that's part of the problem. The story is so poorly written, it drops spoilers on itself. Predictable is too mild a word. The characters are so 1-dimensional, that you can just match them up with their 'Creative Writing 101' archetype when they are introduced. At first there was disappointment with these flaws. But about half way thru, the story reached a point of absurdity that I couldn't help smiling at how awful it was. I also couldn't help but use the 'vast power of my imagination' to envision the author asking himself - "How big a turd will these Choice of Games people pay me to pop out?" The big twist is beyond telegraphed. It's like when a little kid tries to whisper something to you and its louder than if he had spoken in his normal voice. And this so-called twist is delivered to you by a character that is even too campy to be a Bond villain - it's all just laughable! This is the kind of game you gift to someone as a practical joke. I am seriously asking - was this *meant* to be funny? I can't tell.\n\nBut I feel kind of guilty wondering if it may have been a genuine effort at entertaining people. Oh ... that's sad. Now I feel bad again. To avoid inflicting upon others the crushing sense of despair that comes from realizing someone might have poured their heart and soul into something so dreadful, I can't recommend this story/game to anyone. Advice for the Choice of Games people - replace 'ultra-violent' with 'ultra-hilarious' in the game description and repackage it as an assassin parody- but don't tell the author. Then I will come back and give the game a thumbs up.\n\nNow I guess I'll go take a magic healing bubble bath that can help cure gunshot wounds, just like the hero of the story does after a tough mission. I'm not kidding. It's just that ridiculous.","April 22","false","3.1"," 44 of 54 people (81%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","81","44","54","14","0"

Every character has the same voice, everyone vomits exposition at the drop of a hat, and the pacing of the game is spotty. I didn't care about any of the characters, or about the backstory. The frequent flashbacks were annoying as hell. The fight and assassination scenes were good, but that's about it. Overall, the writing on this game was seriously weak.","April 22","false","1.9"," 24 of 34 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","24","34","0","0"

If the alluring fantasy of being a sleek, cool assassin in fiction has ever appealed to you, whether it's through playing Hitman, The Darkness, or taking on the Dark Brotherhood quests in the Elder Scrolls series, or being enthralled by movies like John Wick and Pulp Fiction, this game is for you.\n\nThe writing does a great job of making your character feel formidable and impressive, and rewards how you want to personally characterize them from their personality to their skill set with a rich and interesting set of possibilities. It's one of the closest and most rewarding things I've found outside of some other conventional video games that lets you more or less live out what it would be like to be the star in a high octane action film.\n\nI would freely encourage anyone who thinks they might be interested to check out COG's other games/novels as well (all the free demos let you play out the first three chapters, giving you a fair taste of whether it'll hold your interest or not, so you can't really go wrong there), as I've found most of them to be pretty enjoyable, but I can definitely say there's probably nothing else they can offer that's quite like this.\n\nOf course, the story isn't 100% realistic, but where's the fun in that? If you can suspend your disbelief enough for an interactive novel the same way you would for 1980's Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger movies, but don't want a story that's completely mindless or unbelievable, give the demo a shot at the very least (no pun intended). Not many of their games are usually $5 on Steam, but I'd say this is one of the instances where it's definitely worth it.\n\nThe first time I beat this game, I immediately started another playthrough. This is one I can definitely see myself coming back to again and again over time. It'd be a mistake not to try it if you think you might even be the least bit interested.","April 24","true","0.4"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","12","14","2","0"

Yes, it might be a little easy to see through in parts, but I feel like that about a lot of stories ... I read a lot and you learn to recognize patterns after a while. I liked the writing, too, even though it might perhaps be a little better every now and then.\n\nThe fact alone that I'm rating this game should show I like it ... I usually don't write reviews.","April 24","true","2.6"," 13 of 19 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","13","19","0","0"

I've played a good number of Choice of Games titles and a couple Hosted Games titles and I wouldn't rate this one at the highest but it certaintly wasn't bad. I play all of the games in one sitting (if possible) and I completed this on in 3.6 hours, not a bad length and the story had enough to keep me entertained the whole way through. If you're a fan of the games this is one I'd recommend.","May 12","true","3.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The writing could definitely be better, as there aren't too many elements about any characters, or the story on the whole that I would write home about. It’s fairly predictable, and it’s very easy to navigate the game with a single set of skills without issue or conflict.\n\nBut with the stream of mediocre and even poor games released from Choice of Games, it was nice to play something that was straight forward. The game was advertised as one where you get to be an assassin, and it delivers on that front. That seems like an oddly simple thing to praise a game for, but that’s exactly where these games have been failing of late. They’ve been so busy preaching its own morality that it stopped feeling like I was embarking on an adventure of my own will. They’ve been taking place in entirely author created worlds with too many moving pieces and not nearly enough words or time to let the reader immerse themselves into it; that too with worlds that aren’t nearly as interesting as the respective authors believe them to be. They’re so distracted at being something else that they stop being choose your own adventures.\n\nThis was just that, an adventure where you’re choosing the details, and steering the story. It’s not one of the truly better Choice of Games entries, but I have to give it a positive review for having the right idea, when others are trending in a worse direction. It was an enjoyable game about being an assassin","May 5","true","32.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

From the second I started playing I was hooked.  The writing is great, the pacing is terrific and the detail is engrossing.  I’ve always enjoyed Choice of Games and I’m really happy that there’s finally an assassin COG.  There are a ton of options and different ways to play through the game, which I first got on my phone.  I've now played it a second and third time.  I keep discovering more and more.  I like how you can really choose to be the kind of assassin you want to be.  Definitely recommended.","April 22","true","0.5"," 8 of 52 people (15%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","15","8","52","13","2"
