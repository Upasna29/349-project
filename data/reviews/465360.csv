Probably my favorite example of the Action/RTS genre... a clean blend of shooter mechanics with easy call in units and bases that provides enough of a challenge to be exhilarating but not impossibly difficult. Warning: I ♥♥♥♥ing love this game so I'm a bit biased.\n\nUprising Review:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C98-EARNPww\n\nExplained shortly, Uprising is a game where you control a command tank called a Wraith. This wraith has over a dozen different weapons with power systems that allow you to allocate more power to weapons, shields or speed. The Wraith is also able to call in units (anywhere you're looking) and buildings (on black/yellow control pads) which require resources that are mined by "Power Facilities." All units and buildings are upgradeable with credits earned for every battle won. You move around the battlefield, blasting away enemy targets (Native, Imperial factions) and taking over their control points by claiming them with "Citadels" (♥♥♥♥normously large towers that violate enemy forces). Your overall goal is defeat the Imperials and establish a new order of freedom and happiness... or something like that. What's REALLY important is all the ♥♥♥ you're going to kick in the Wraith.\nIn summation, it's dated, the graphics aren't the best (I've always enjoyed those old 3dfx games) but the gameplay shows a genre that could've become popular but never really did.","May 19","true","0.5"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","73","11","15","4","3"

I originally played the demo when I was growing up, which only had 2 maps (this version has 20), but the game was that good and innovative that I must have played those maps dozens of times each!\n\nMajor con: This game likes to crash. A lot. And if memory serves this was true in 1997 as well. I mean seriously, how did they ever release it like this? As a programmer I know that memory corruption bugs can be damn hard to track down, but jeez! Just make sure you save fairly often (at the very least after every mission) and you won't lose too much progress. Mostly I only lost a minute here or there, though I did lose an entire mission when it crashed right as I won :(\n\nThe single player campaign took me 17 hours to complete every mission, which is a pretty decent amount of content for it's time. It's possible to skip some missions or play them in a different order, so it could probably be done in less time if you rush. The difficulty curve is good - the earlier missions should ease you into the game, while some of the later missions really keep you on your toes and you really can't let your guard down. I tried doing one of the missions earlier than I should have, and was absolutely creamed as neither I nor my support units could take down any of the enemy turrets. Went back and did a few other missions to get some better tech and had a... less difficult time.\n\nSince the game is pretty unique, I'll go over it's gameplay a little:\n\nYou directly control a one of a kind souped up Tank (The Wraith) on the battlefield, but you also call in support units as you need them. But, unlike other strategy games, most of the support units (except the Bomber) teleport directly to your location allowing you to instantly deploy a formidable army whenever you need it, and periodically reinforce it. When you've finished blasting whatever it was to smitherines, you simply recycle the units to recover their resources so you can deploy them again elsewhere (or not, if you would rather leave them to defend the area or just have plenty of resources to spare).\n\nYou capture Citadels in the game, which are huge towers with big guns that serve as your bases. They are capable of defending themselves, but you will often need to take direct control of them when they come under attack (which leavs your Wraith vaulnerable, but doing so automatically raises it's shields to maximum and it can take quite a beating). This also allows you to easily deploy more units and turrets around the Citadel to help defend it, even though you might be way over the other side of the map.\n\nGiven it's from 1997 you will have to spend some time rebinding the controls to modern best practices (and turn that damn mouse acceleration off and bump the sensitivity up to max), but that's all doable. The main changes I had to make was WASD for movement, TAB for overhead map, Q to control a Citadel, R to recycle a unit. Cycle power triangle is fine on C, but learn to use it effectively! I set my mouse wheel to generate [ and ] to switch secondary weapons, though you can use the number row for some of them as well. I left the unit deploy keys as F1-F7 even though they are a little awkward because I'm still used to them being that from 1997.\n\nMinor con: This was one of the earliest 3D DirectX games and the draw distance sucks as a result. You can raise it in the settings a little, but even the max is still pretty low. I find this more annoying than the low resolution, especially when you know there is an enemy building just out of the draw distance from a Citadel and if only you could see where it was you could eliminate it from a distance...","May 27","true","18.0"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","2"

Love this game. Played the demo when I was like 10 years old on repeat. Works okay on Windows 10 x64 (had to install DirectPlay Windows Feature) - crashes once in a while mainly when pressing F9 to quick save. Other than that, works okay on my modern system and brings back memories. Thanks to whoever got this ported and on Steam. I had the old CD and was using a Win98 VM previously to get this working but couldn't get the 3DFX Wrapper working properly so this on Steam for under $5 was awesome since it works right out of the box. :)","May 21","true","5.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You play as an advanced Wraith Hover Tank. You have a large arsenal of weapons you can upgrade to as you play through each Planetary & Solar System campaign, you build & defend your bases and call in units whether they be infantry, tanks, aav or bombers on the fly as you conquer through each map. Not bad for a nearly 20 year old game... wait... what? I just realized how old it was... im gettin' old... *facepalm*\n\nBought this to see if it was finally optimized to at least play on Windows 7. While it does, its definitely a dated classic. I own the disc version, but had to make some tweaks with that version to get it to play stable enough where it wouldnt CTD (crash to desktop) every 10 minutes or have random UI glitches just like its sequel Uprising 2 Lead & Destroy had. With this version its the Software mode version, not the 3dfx Glide version with smoother textures. However I do have nGlide installed and even though its running software mode by default it picked up the nGlide wrapper which was cool and possibly gave the steam version a little more stability.\n\nAs is, this game series was a cult classic, not widely popular except to those who found it. The only con I can truly say I wish couldve been fixed, was the clunk mouse movement for aiming. There has been no way to fix this manually, it feels like im using an old ball mouse and it rollers are all junked up and sticking making it look like my mouse movements are getting stuck every so often.\n\nEdit - This Gamer came out of no where and fixed the problem I had for a long time. "DarkStarSword - Mouse aiming is easy to fix - in the controls menu set the acceleration slider all the way down and the sensitivity slider all the way up."","May 28","true","0.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

It's graphics and gameplay was like nothing made before. This set the bar for many RTS games to come.\n\nI lost my original disc and couldnt find an English version online. To my luck i found this on steam. This game features everything the original had and at a very cheap price.\n\nThe only down side is that sometimes it crashes during gameplay. I have only played the training missions and 1 campaign mission. It crashed multiple times but I think if you are careful and don't click or hit esc whilst its loading or try to alt-tab etc. It should minimize the amount of crashes.\n\ntl;dr:\nGame is good but it crashes sometimes.\n\nP.S This worked on my Windows 7, idk bout Windows 10 :/","May 22","true","7.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"
