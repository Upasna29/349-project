I played the first two games in the series to death back when they came out.\n\nImpressions:\nCommandos stands tall among action strategy games. It was a simple formula: a set of men are dropped into a mission, each with a certain set of skills and using them in concert you dismantle the enemies defences and confound their long term goals.\n\nWhile the games does lean heavily on the two most useful characters (Tiny and the Spy) the situations force you to think creatively and apart from a few small instances you are completely free to tackle the mission as you see fit.\n\nIt's almost bewildering that no game has successfully recaptured the formula since, even the successive games in the franchises have failed to really improve or even live up to this classic piece of strategy.\n\nEach mission can take minutes or even several hours to complete on your first run through and while the Merit system on completion gives you a score (based on damage taken, damage done and speed of completion) you can be drawn back to try and complete the mission quicker and more cleverly there is ultimately no reward for doing so.. other than your own satisfaction.\n\nThe biggest issue is that the Steam version of the game installs poorly and in an almost unusable state. the game runs impossibly fast on modern PCs, the config file is missing the line to allow saving, multicore PCs will make the game unstable and widescreen monitors have black bands at the boarders. thankfully all these can be fixed and I've collated all the fixes I used on the Commandos wikia as noted below.\n\nFixes:\n\nSee the page on the 'Commandos Wikia' for 'Commandos: Behind Enemy Lines Fixes'.\n\nhttp://commandos.wikia.com/wiki/Fixing_Commandos\n\nThe Good:\n*A classic formula that stands up today for it's simplicity and functions.\n*Missions can be tackled many ways.\n*The settings have a historical context and introduced as such.\n*Missions are diverse.\n*Fast save/load system makes experimentation less frustrating than you'd think.\n*Huge sense of triumph from executing a plan that takes out even a single awkward guard.\n*Looks pretty good considering it's age.\n\nThe Bad:\n*Terrible install from Steam that makes the game unplayable without some searching and tweaking.\n*Merit is heavily determined by speed which I don't find fun.\n*The leveling mechanic 'Merit' never had a function originally nor now.\n*Vehicles are overpowered but also limited.\n*A few missions have an element that only has one solution...\n*Leading to some missions having to be restarted unless you keep lots of saves.\n\nRecommended for: War, Action and isometric strategy fans.\n\nConclusion.\n9/10. Once the screen, stability and speed issues are fixed it's a huge blast.","November 26, 2013","true","61.8"," 70 of 78 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","70","78","0","1"

The problem here is that STEAM are selling a broken product without mentioning it to the buyer. IT SHOULD BE AGAINST THE LAW!! It's only £10 for all 4 games but it is the principle. Behind Enemy Lines and Beyond The Call Of Duty are UNPLAYABLE on new machines without the EXCELLENT fix that you can find links to in other posts. You cannot LOAD or SAVE for God sake! The game moves at SUPERSPEED compared to the way it should when running properly. Even with the fix, things like the mission preview, where your commanding officer walks you through the mission, don't always work, at least in my experience. Commandos 3, the newest of the games, also isn't working. You cannot show the enemy vision, which is a crutial part of the game. The game just goes crazy and seems to switch between different enemy vision, making it difficult to move. It's very frustrating.\n\nSo like I said, these games are all time classics but STEAM taking your money with no mention of the problems you will encounter is UNACCEPTABLE.","May 12, 2014","false","9.8"," 96 of 122 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","96","122","0","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/talgaby/recommended/6800/","talgaby","talgaby","http://steamcommunity.com/id/talgaby/","334 products in account","Short version: 87%Commandos is one of the greatest classics of squad-based tactical combat games, where you command a group of elite soldiers through twenty maps of sabotage in semi-realistic World War II scenarios. The map and control design were so well made that this game still shines as bright as it did in 1998.\n\nLong version:Commandos: Behind Enemy Lines combines isometric tactical combat with real-time strategy and stealth. This mixture works so perfectly that it is still remembered by many to this date not just as a beloved childhood game, but as something revolutionary.\n\nAnd Commandos achieved this without any real plot. All twenty maps are more or less based on real WWII events, but they don’t have much story other than a historical introduction piece and a short mission briefing. No underlying plot, no character drama, just meticulously designed levels with several objectives.\n\nAchieving these goals usually requires careful planning, lots of sneaking around, and diversion tactics. Enemy guards are placed in strategic ways, and getting discovered or leaving a body in the open results in an alarm, which usually leads to mission failure.\nTo finish the task, the player gets control over six commandos, all with distinct, unique abilities. Sadly, all but two of them are useless for almost anything apart from one certain task (driving the getaway car, rowing the boat, and so on), since only they can move dead bodies out of the way – something that is crucial on all levels. All the others usually just camp in one safe corner of the map, unused for most of the mission.\n\nThe game was well-received and spawned an entire franchise, which in retrospect made Behind Enemy Lines the one with the shortest and easiest levels, but also with the biggest variety. It’s not as difficult as Beyond the Call of Duty, as complex as Men of Courage, or as action-oriented as Destination: Berlin, but still retains most of its old charm.","July 22, 2015","true","23.1"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","16","17","0","0"

Replacing the default files with the new files in the package made the game actually start up, but without any sound.

Still i was fascinated by this game and played it over and over.\n\nImpressions:\nAs this game uses isometric 2D grafics, its still nice and playable today. The old feeling (if you know the game) comes back fast and it sucks you in from the first missions on. Even if you dont know the game, the first missions are rather easy so you can get used to the gameplay as it's a bit different to todays strategic games.\nLater you will be overwhelmed at the beginning (so many guards, "impossible to get throught",...) but once you try out some tactics you will be rewarded. The feeling (even for killing THAT nasty single guard) is great! As every character has some specials, there are often various working approaches. Only at some points you have only a single useable tactic, but in my opinion this is not very annoying.\nAlso, as this is an old game, you can Quicksave/Load, this helps alot as many things in this game require excellent timing. So, if you miss this little timeslot, just try it again.\n\nThere are some negativ points ofc, still it's up to everyone how they weight the impact... The points with only one approach I already mentioned, another thing is the rating. It's based alot on the time you need for a mission, this can also be interesting for some people, but still i didn't like it that much (for the full rating you need to be VERY fast on some missions...). Also some missions seem overwhelming, there is no hint how to start. So for new players or people who dont like to think alot before starting, this is maybe a downside. For me personally this as not a problem, also i didnt notice more negativ points (for me).\n\nNon-Game issiue\nThere is one thing not really related to the game itself. After the install its not playable. You need to apply the speed-fix at least, some other, more individuall problems could also occor. I found all the things for fixing with a quick search and a look in the forums, still this game should be playable right after install imho.\nAs I saw this in another review: SAVING IS POSSIBLE, if not you have not the right fixess ;)\n\nRating\nBecause the Steaminstaller is so bad:\n8/10\nThe game itself:\n9/10","December 29, 2013","true","13.1"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

I'm very glad to see it on steam. This game requires more patience than I had when i played it 15 years ago.  My tips are: read the F1 help menu in game and learn the keyboard shortcuts/commands. My other tip is, make sure you use multiple saves!  This game makes you feel like a boss everytime you beat a level.\nThe only thing it stuffers from is a slightly outdated ui. It would be nice for the game to display the keyboard commands on the game screen rather than in an F1 menu. The amount of keyboard shortcuts is out of the realm of fast memorization. I actually took a pad of paper and just wrote down the keyboard shortcuts. This is only a problem because as a digital download you dont have the benefit of a nice printed user manual in front of you; something that this game originaly came with.

Mood","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Anitude/","940 products in account","A real-time tactics game consisting of 20 missions with a lot of wonks and bonks in design but overall satisfying to play.\n\nYou use a team of commandos, numbers vary by mission, to perform assigned objectives then exit the area. It's relatively like a puzzle game where you'll have to time certain tasks right and use an appropriate commando in an appropriate situation. For the most part you'll be using one commando more than the rest however everyone does play a vital role and in order to finish a mission as "cleanly" as possible everyone will be required to fulfill their roles in each mission.\nA real cool feature this game has is the ability to have multiple (I think a maximum of 8 total) windows in the game and a function that lets the camera for the selected window to follow an enemy or commando.\n\nThe game requires quite a bit of thinking and even though you've got the enemy's movements down and you know your way around you'll still need a lot of patience to get through a mission without causing too much or no fuss. Each mission also gets much, much lengthier as you progress (after I think mission 15/20 it takes me around 3 or more hours to complete).\nIt will be very helpful to learn the shortcut keys for each commando (as opposed to always clicking on their items) for better convenience and quicker actions in given situations. Unfortunately the keys are un-rebindable so memorizing the keys may be a bit more of a hassle.\n\nThe AI, whether the Nazis or your commandos, can be pretty dumb. The commandos will have a habit of spazzing out or maybe taking some weird extra 2-foot diagonal path or whatever when maybe all you wanted them to do is walk along the wall whilst hugging it and turn on the next corner while still hugging said wall. The Nazis, especially the ones in groups, may glitch up a bit when making a turn on their paths meaning their field of visions have a good chance of going all over the place.\n\nWith an isometric game like this I figured you should at least be able to see or go "behind" large structures especially since the enemy can do it, but you can't. If you click on a building thinking you'll go "behind" it then the assigned commando will most likely try to find the fastest route "in front" of it. It's also a pain every now and again to try and put one commando where another is specifically located because there's no option to click through your guys so you may accidentally click on your guy instead of moving one there.\n\nReally it's a cool game and despite all its design flaws it feels good to get through a really tough and lengthy mission.","May 27, 2015","true","43.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Over, and over, and over... Better than 90% of my deaths come from this control interface issue. Which would be fine, except this first game in the series won't allow me to save in-mission. So, you either do the whole mission start to finish, without getting your lads killed, or you stroll over to an enemy soldier that you meant to sprint for, and you're doomed. The levels have passwords instead of save game files. It's blood boilingly awful.\nStill, the game is worth getting and it's worth persevering with. Just be prepared to needlessly start each and every level possibly dozens of times over because you double clicked and the user interface didn't register it. (If the mouse moves AT ALL between the first and second clicks, the game reads it as two single clicks, and your soldier walks to his objective with no sense of urgency.)

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cucamonganewjersey/recommended/6800/","cucamonganewjersey","New Jersey","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cucamonganewjersey/","10 products in account","I originally played this game in what seemed like a different life; back in 1998 when it came out. I remember spending countless hours playing this game, and I remember it being incredibly difficult but loads of fun. It is very reminiscent of other strategy games of the mid-late nineties, but set in World War II.\n\nYou command a group of commandos, all with different skills and abilities. Each stage has different line-ups of soldiers and usually a different inventory. The spy can disguise himself as a Nazi captain, the Marine can dive underwater and commandeer an inflatable raft, the driver can control tanks, the sapper can place bombs and traps, etc. Some characters run faster, and only some characters can heal.\n\nI will say, if you are looking for an easy play through and/or get easily frustrated, this game is NOT for you. It is very challenging and you die almost immediately if you are caught. You will find yourself constantly saving and loading, and I found it not uncommon to save/load around fifty times a map. It is stealth based and you will die if you go in guns blazing. Don't let this discourage you though, since it's a very fun game and gave me countless hours of entertainment.\n\nWhen I bought this game here on Steam it was something stupid-cheap like 75 cents. Even if you only play a map or two, you get your money's worth to at least give it a try. It is of course heavily dated (I almost laughed when I saw the system requirements), but the value and fun is there. Give it a shot, you won't regret it.","December 26, 2014","true","21.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I can only find old outdated posts on the Steam forums by users that made fixes, but all the sharing site links are down and no longer working.  THE GAME DOES NOT WORK STOCK ON STEAM.  How they get away with reselling this garbage that plain doesn't work is beyond me.  I've also read that these versions are 1.0, not even patched to the latest versions.\n\nOnce you get it working, if you do, the controls are god awful.  You have to literally memorize 10 different hotkeys for each soldier.  Unlike most RTS games, where if you click an attack on an enemy, your unit will close into range and attack.  Not here.  In this crappy game they stand there like idiots until you tell them to move with a hotkey, and then tell them to attack with another hotkey.  By then they're dead.  I don't care if it's an old game.  I recall getting a demo on an old PC Gamer disc, and there were tons of RTS games like Command & Conquer out by then.  Whomever designed the UI in this game needs to be shot.  This game was originally released in 1998, so there's no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ excuse for this.  There is waaaaay too much micro management here for an RTS to where you were wishing it was either turn-based, or the controls were consolidated enough to where your unit weren't so worthless.\n\nI guess after I fixed the speed as well as the saved games not working I now get to try to find something that will bind custom hotkeys.\n\nDo not waste your dollar on this garbage because the time spent to get it all working will cost you more in the end.","March 10, 2014","false","0.5"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","5","9","0","0"

The game offers a huge campaign that will take you many hours, as this game is very difficult.  You control different commandos with varying skills and equipment.  You must complete your goals.  While the premise is simple, the limited health and ability to survive once you are spotted makes this game a true stealth game.  By moving multiple commandos all in real time, this adds even more difficulty.  The game is well done, however, it lacks the features that could easily be found in today's games of a similar type of genre.  I recommend it because I find it was well done and still plays well, however, if you're not into a difficult stealth game, then this just isn't for you.

I've not seen many like it. Only the Desperado games, set in the Wild West, as far as I know.\n\nCommandos: Behind Enemy Lines follows bunch of special missions in WWII where you as an officer use the skills of a couple specialised commandos, specially trained British soldiers. Each commando has his own set of tools to help you to complete each mission. And it's up to you to decide when and how to utilise each commando to overcome certain obstacles. If any of your commandos dies, you'll fail the mission. You'll have to pay attention not to alert any of the German soldiers or officers, as they're always alert and on the lookout. They watch and listen to anything suspicious. Some garrison buildings with the swastika flying will contain soldiers that will come out and patrol when the alarm is sounded. This will make your missions far more difficult, so stealth is key. Each new mission is an ever bigger puzzle you have to try to complete. You have 20 to complete.\n\nThe game has, despite being from 1998 and sometimes in need of workarounds to get it working properly, a great atmosphere, supported by actual WWII film footage and little background stories, and a unique aesthetic.","November 8, 2015","true","0.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The variety of different tactics that you can use on each map make this game feel incredibly deep and well thought out. Despite its age, the game play is highly enjoyable and fans of 2D isometric maps will find that the landscapes and units are still well detailed and crisp, even at the low resolutions the game offers.","September 21, 2014","true","12.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

In Commandos: Behind Enemy Lines, instead of controlling massive armies, you control six specialized units. The map is designed in such a way that makes all your units have synergy with each other. While you can win early games with very little use of decoys, stealing, and stealth, the end game requires your mastery of all your units’ abilities. This game is as perfect a strategy game as chess. Like chess you see the battlefield with no fog of war, there is no resource management, and none of the numerical/economic factors that limit the pure strategy/tactics of the game. The only fault I can even find on Commandos: Behind Enemy Lines is its severe lack of sound, voice, and ambience.","May 5, 2012","true","45.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

E.T. is better than this game and that's saying a lot. You know what actually E.T. isn't that bad of a game because it's got some decent gameplay aspects it's just that the game doesn't tell you what to do so it's like what's the point of playing it. If there were proper instructions, it'd be a much better game. It's just critized because it was expected to be a better game at launch and it caused a lot of people to flip but that's okay because we all look back on that now and say "hey that was funny". So playing E.T. now and knowing what to do, it's actually a pretty good game and overall I'd give it a 7.5/10.\n\n\nBut "Commandos: Behind Enemy Lines" gets a 0/10 pls don't play.","December 30, 2015","false","0.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

They are part of an older action genre that luckily died out in favor of better RTS games.  Basically in Commandos there is only one way to perform the mission and you have to look around and do a lot of trial and error, read that as dying over and over again, to try different things at various times in order to progress.  I was looking for something along the lines of Rush To Berlin or something similar and this is a far cry from that masterpiece.

And, it is even better than i expected!\nThe map desigh is really nice, not just visually, but gameplay wise too. Every guard's placement is just perfect, and when you find your way to the final objective, you feel that "hell yeah, i did it!"\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, i find annoying that some guards randomly turn around when you try to knife them from behind. But, that is what quicksave is for! I have to note, that either i missed it, or the game doesn't tell how to save/load. However, without this function longer maps are nearly impossible to complete.\nSo i tell you that the combinations are ctrl+S for save, and ctrl+L for loading, if you didn't know that already.\n\nFor coop game you have to run the multiplayer server program, but it is simple enough, and works without any problems. On the other hand sometimes i've experienced serious delay (like 3 sec) even when the server was running on my computer. Saving and reloading solved the problem most of the time though.\n\n\n\nAll in all, this game is really well designed, and i'd suggest to try it if you're not scared of using your brain a little.","February 4, 2015","true","9.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It was a proud addition to the Windows 95 and still is welcomed back with open arms to my modern rig. God, it's old but the graphics still look beautiful (albeit pixelated if you zoom in)\n\nTHIS is how tactical games are meant to be. You're completely outnumbered and out-gunned. If, like me as a 9-year old with no concept of strategy, you try and just run in shooting things: you'll quickly become overrun. No, this game is about leveraging the skills of your commandos to silently dispatch the enemy guards as you make your way into increasingly heavily fortified locations - Blowing up dams, radar stations and even taking down a battleship. It's an exceptionally unforgiving game though... if you trip the alarm just once, everywhere will be crawling with patrols. Though the frustration can be high in places, there's nothing quite as rewarding as cracking it and seeing an enemy HQ get blown to pieces\n\nI have to say, even for an old game, the explosions are truly satisfying\n\nYou get 20 missions (+tutorials) which provide obscene amounts of hours you'll spend studying enemy moments, making the killing blows... or more likely getting caught and shot. Once you're past the first level or 2, each of the missions are sprawling with soldiers. In fact, in all the years I've had it, I've still only got to around level 14 - so length of gameplay is not an issue by far!\n\nYour team consists of a selection of 6 Commandos... Each with their own unique set of skills and abilities (and cool personalities derived well from just the portraits and responses). You control them from the 'birds-eye' view, much like most RTS games. Gratefully, the game tends to be generous enough to give you multiple ways to approach a situation, allowing the freedom to play to your style (to a degree)\n\nThe only snag - It's not quite 100% stable on modern machines yet (though the team porting it have done a grand job of fixing the speed and lack of saves) - If you have trouble, try to skip the Intro Movies and Mission Briefing. You can still find the objectives by clicking the small triangle on the map on the right of the screen - the map itself also circles any main objectives), so you're at least not without the actual gameplay\n\nOki Doki!","December 12, 2014","true","4.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It was a proud addition to the Windows 95 and still is welcomed back with open arms to my modern rig. God, it's old but the graphics still look beautiful (albeit pixelated if you zoom in)\n\nTHIS is how tactical games are meant to be. You're completely outnumbered and out-gunned. If, like me as a 9-year old with no concept of strategy, you try and just run in shooting things: you'll quickly become overrun. No, this game is about leveraging the skills of your commandos to silently dispatch the enemy guards as you make your way into increasingly heavily fortified locations - Blowing up dams, radar stations and even taking down a battleship. It's an exceptionally unforgiving game though... if you trip the alarm just once, everywhere will be crawling with patrols. Though the frustration can be high in places, there's nothing quite as rewarding as cracking it and seeing an enemy HQ get blown to pieces\n\nI have to say, even for an old game, the explosions are truly satisfying\n\nYou get 20 missions (+tutorials) which provide obscene amounts of hours you'll spend studying enemy moments, making the killing blows... or more likely getting caught and shot. Once you're past the first level or 2, each of the missions are sprawling with soldiers. In fact, in all the years I've had it, I've still only got to around level 14 - so length of gameplay is not an issue by far!\n\nYour team consists of a selection of 6 Commandos... Each with their own unique set of skills and abilities (and cool personalities derived well from just the portraits and responses). You control them from the 'birds-eye' view, much like most RTS games. Gratefully, the game tends to be generous enough to give you multiple ways to approach a situation, allowing the freedom to play to your style (to a degree)\n\nThe only snag - It's not quite 100% stable on modern machines yet (though the team porting it have done a grand job of fixing the speed and lack of saves) - If you have trouble, try to skip the Intro Movies and Mission Briefing. You can still find the objectives by clicking the small triangle on the map on the right of the screen - the map itself also circles any main objectives), so you're at least not without the actual gameplay\n\nOki Doki!","December 12, 2014","true","4.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Literaly it's all focused on one platoon of specialized commados instead of a whole army.\n\n-Each of your crew members have their own abilities & using the right one at the right time is crucial. you will only have a specific set of commandos in each missions (except on the later ones where more/everyone is involved) which will limits your actions in different ways.\n\n-Each missions takes time, say between 15 to 30 minutes (or more) depending at how you visualize/complete them.\n\n-Stealth is primordial, everyone needs to come back alive. "Remember, this is a sneaking mission."\n\n-Getting mad, yelling, cursing is optionnal but will happen on it's own somehow...\n\n\nOverall, really surprised by how long it took me to complete it (50 hours), the replay-value is off the chart, the multiple ways of completing missions makes you go back, and so on. I absolutely recommend it, especially on sale & bundled with the sequels.\n\n*Command & Conquer.\n*Age of Empire.","June 2","true","63.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
