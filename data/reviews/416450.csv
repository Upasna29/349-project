I do not know how they can claim it is an early access game.  The game has been on Facebook for 5 years now.\n\nIf you do not want to read the whole reveiw here is the #1 game breaking killer for me.\nAfer 99 days the world totally resets.\nYou lose your hero, you lose your town, you lose your armies, you lose your items.\n\nNow if that one thing does not do it for you then we will get into the obvious pay to win model found here.\nYou can spend real money to buy more resources.\nYou can spend real money to speed up building time.\nYou can spend real money to speed up training time.\nYou can spend real money to buy weapons and armor for your hero.\nYou can spend real money to buy command points, the currency that allows you to raid things in game, otherwise you get 1 per hour why you wait and watch your buildings grow.\n\nYou can raid other players cities but you can not take them over??\n\nApparently the goal of the game is for an alliance to build something as a team to win??\n\nSo some other reviews compared this to Lords of Ultima, well only in the basic bare bones sense.\nIt is more like Travian where the higher levels raid the lower levels 5 minutes after the new player protection wears off in 5 days.  There is no bunker, so when you get raided you will lose 100% of all your resources.\n\nSome good things for a browser game, forge, magic spells, basic research.\nHowever, since you are coming in through steam you can not have 4 tabs open and play something else while you wait, or stream movies through Hulu or Netflix.  No, all you can do is have this one game open and wait and wait and wait or spend or spend or spend and watch everything go away in 99 days.\n\nSo I started the game, it was on day 11 so I have a few days to keep playing it.","April 3","false","13.5"," 65 of 75 people (87%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","87","65","75","5","0"

For the first few days of this you may have fun. You might even figure out how to play on other worlds and harvest and sell goods for gems (premium currency) which you can then use on your main account. However, even after finding out that this game is only pay2win-for-the-ignorant I'm still left with this feeling that this game doesn't have enough to keep me wanting to come back. The battles last about a minute, there are no graphics (just a clock). There is an arena, joy! But the Arena fights are over and decided, calculated by some algorithm in a matter of miliseconds (literally after you choose your opponent, it's over). I understand, there are many games like these. But these games belong in browsers, for casual gamers and not on steam for people that actually know what a real strategy, or an mmorts feels like. This is just bubblegum. You'll spit it out too.

Everyone who complains about "p2w" havent probably got a real taste of games in this genre.\n\nIt is a time consuming game, again it is natural for the game to be like so. Reminds me of Game of War in mix with Stormfall. First few days you grow and once you reach a certain point of power and capability of raiding, you plan your next moves with an alliance or on your own.\n\nAs for the shop, these are the things you can purchase if you wish to use real cash:\n- Call to Arms (actually have no idea what the thing does, but assuming it allowes you to attack?)\n- shield for 10 hours\n- name change and stronghold tp\n- resource generation boost and resource packs (for example 1,500 of wood)\n- extra building function (you have 2 building functions by default), research speed up, training speed up, mana production speed up\n\nSuch products can be seen in EVERY game in this genre at a cost of mostly real money, so dry your rivers of tears on that. As well as that, these purchases are not necceary at all.\n\nFor a strategy game of its kind, it definetly is a decent one.\n","March 23","true","8.6"," 17 of 28 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","17","28","0","8"

You can have just as much fun playing as without paying for it.\nThe community will talk to you and shoot you advice. It's nice to see such friendliness in a cut throat style game.\nThere are a lot of ways of leveling up your hero and mistakes only make for a better gameplay.\nThe game resets after a certain amount of days and this is so you can experience the game again differently. It allows people to level up and to try a new path.\nI think they nailed the RTS system down and none of the requirements are too hefty.\n\n\nCons:\nI think the only complaint is the higher levels can attack whoever they want. It should be implemented that only 4 levels above you can attack. I lost all my troops and re sources (though the game gave me a freebee diplomacy).\n\nIF YOU LIKE AN RTS WITH A TWIST, THIS ONE IS FOR YOU.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lokarin/recommended/416450/","Lokarin","BBX","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lokarin/","994 products in account","Early Access Review\n\ntl;dr:  It's an idling game with a few clever ideas implemented in the worst way\n\n\nEmporea is an idling game where you can join Alliances(guilds/clans/teams) and build up a city and army to raid monster camps and propsper - or attack players and win.\n\nOn the core level, it's actually pretty robust for an idling game - there's a fair number of unit types and progress and the way you can trade between allies is intuitive and useful since the various races require different combinations of resources to be effective.  My Dwarven army was virtually always out of Stone or Iron, but Stone moreso since buildings needed it more.  However, I always had a gross abundance of Wood - and I would trade Wood for Stone with a teammate and this was cool.\n\nIt has some Facebook style BS I hate where you have to ask random friends for random items as well as give those random items away (without it reducing your quantity) which is also 90% of the gameplay for WEBKINZ, but because it's only used for Alchemy in this game, which has limited utility, it balances out.\n\nNow, this is where things turn south...  After a few days of upgrades you'll notice that some of the top clans are insurmountably better than everyone else combined.  This is because, ugh, PAY 2 WIN.\n\nNow, ok - Pay2Win is something people just have to accept in this style of game, but it conflicts with another core element...  individual servers reset at the end of every season, which is relatively short (3 months);  Similar to NukeZone.   Both ideas work on their own, but the moment you combine them ANY notion of fair competition flies out the window.  You can have either/or, but not BOTH.\n\nYou don't have to Pay2Win, after all - it's not like you NEED to win, it's just a game right?  Well, this brings up the next point - the reseting servers.  The Pay4Play item in this game is called Gems, and like most Freemium games you can find a few of them naturally while playing.  The downside is... GEMS PROGRESS ACROSS SERVERS!!  So now not only can you Pay2Win if you wanted, but you can level up an alt to farm items for your closed realm - completely defeating the purpose of limited servers.\n\nHowever, ok - maybe you don't care about competition at all... you're just here for the sweet Achievement Score on AStats, well - you're good to go, you can get almost all of them from playing one server of each race concurrently.  If you are very active, the SMALLEST idling period is 5~6 minutes - to raid a portal for a token reward, it's easy to switch realms in this time period and be set for life, maybe even getting GEMs you can use on your other characters.  But you'll NEVER get the victory achievement...  even if you dump tens of THOUSANDS of dollars on the game, you'd have to have an entire alliance doing the same, while also all feeding their own meta progress via alternate servers.  You can't actually win, not ever.\n\n\nOn the other hand, if you simply don't care about winning and just like idling games - there's a lot to do in this game, so it's certainly worth a try, just don't get mad (like me) when you finally cash in 50 quest items only to see the number 1 player cashed in 100'000 of them.","April 20","false","48.4"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

I can kinda get why a city simulator with wait times would be popular on a mobile device but why on pc. This isnt like a portable iphone its a pc so therefor this genre doesnt work on this platform. And if u havnt guessed already this is pay to win as ♥♥♥♥. I can understand paid items in csgo or league but in a game like this it isnt just cosmetic change that doesnt impact skill its straight up cheating.who wants to wait 5 hours for u to build up a new building in a city all to have it destroyed or downgraded by a kid using his mums credit card like a sword. Additionally half of the accounts on this game are inactive so trying to build up a group or a "clan" is difficult because most of the people you invite wont respond. All in all dont buy this game its a waste of time.","April 17","false","6.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

SLOW.\n\nHow slow would you ask?   So slow that once you join the game it's damn near impossible to JOIN an alliance regardless of how high ranked they are compared to you.   I got 1 alliance in my first game day of playing, but then just AFTER a 2 DAY vacation I went off onto I came home to log in & find out I was removed some how without an explanation at all.\n\nSo guilds are worthless or "alliances" are almost impossible to finally join one permanently so yes slow there as well.\n\nVery slow progression unless you PAY 2 WIN, you send out your mini army which is kinda neat to send to a whole bunch of areas on the map, but it's nothing impressive, it's not a ARMY you send out it's a little dude on a horse with a flag...\n\nPitiful, what's also pitiful is how LONG it takes for it to travel, if we have to wait THAT LONG for them to march on it would be much better and MORE IMPRESSIVE if they would have the animation have actual armies go by while watching WHAT OTHER ARMIES ARE DOING AS YOU'RE PLAYING.\n\nThis means that say I send out my troops to one area while there are millions of other people doing the same, you can SEE them do that, then what's to say... you send YOUR troops to attack theirs before they get to their destination, hm?\n\nThat would be a new way to add a small minigame there or just to see how the strategy & "turn of tides" in gameplay would go.\n\nAlso, the artwork looks of course WAY TOO BETA, of course it'll probably change, but for now if anyone's really thinking of playing it's not really the greatest at the moment.\n\n\nThis game needs the biggest facelift in gaming history in order to actually make it work, but I have now way of seeing how the hell they would even get that far to making this worth anybodies time to wait for hours & hours of things to finish building and not to mention the PAY TO WIN FEATURE...\n\nYeah this game is already broken, the ONLY PEOPLE that actually play this are those that feel that they have to prove they're better than the other factions because they have more money than the other.\n\nAs a matter of fact that's the only reason why these games exist, the developer builds & designs the game for competition, but the gamer on the other side has no idea that while they are trying to compete they are actually just throwing money at a means of saying "yeah you're on top, now look at your bone dry bank account!"\n\nROFL,  you people never get it when it comes to game development, but at some point you'll all eventually get the right idea for REAL games some day.\n\nTill then, good luck cash farming off of morons.","March 27","false","1.9"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","6","14","0","0"

(looooong history)\n\nI used to play it on bigpoint, when it was version 2. Then i played version 3 somewhere and today the version 4 is even better and well-balanced. (v2 undead was OP!)\n\n10hours/day was my daily dose, now as recovered addict 5 is enough.\n\nSo the game itself is played on servers that have fixed time of ending and every 2 weeks starts a new one. Devs have implemented speed-up mechanic for new comers, so when you even start a server late with buffs you can easily catchup with the rest of players. During the world every 2 weeks are special events with unique units so the gameplay doesnt get repetitive. Sometimes there is a special world that has different rules than the other ones.\n\nEven when the game is freemium the endgame is more about politics and tactics than money spent.\n\nDevs are very responsive and friendly (thumbsup)\n\nthe game is still in beta, so bugs&glitches are occasional but after reporting to devs. They are fixed either instantly or in some next update (game gets updated regularly every 2 weeks).\n\nAlso you can play it on android or apple device!\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\ntl;dr if you like oldschool mmo rpg-strategic mid-core games this one is for you definitely 11/10","March 17","true","37.5"," 25 of 71 people (35%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","35","25","71","3","0"
