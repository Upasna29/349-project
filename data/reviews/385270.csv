There's not much else to say about the game itself so I'll crack on with the rest of my review.\n\n+A fair amount of customisation is available for your car, you can change the paint colour which is pretty basic but you can also upgrade the components of your car as well as fine tune them to create the best vehicle possible\n+The car's damage models are good and the car breaks apart nicely upon impacts, smashing into things is a big part of the game so this is rather important\n+Decent sound effects, the car noises are reasonably realistic in particular\n\n-Keyboard controls are, as expected of a racing game, bad and despite the dev claiming the game is best played with a gamepad the gamepad controls are quite possibly worse with terribly thought out bindings and no way to change the bindings for the gamepad (keyboard bindings can be changed)\n-There are currently only four maps available, two of which are just a short section of one of the other maps\n-The camera occasionally swaps angle randomly and most of the camera angles in the game are completely useless for a fast paced racing game - Seemingly this has now been fixed\n-The driving and general physics aren't even slightly realistic despite the claims on the store page and in the forums\n-None of the UI is explained at all making it almost completely pointless\n-The point system doesn't really work properly, I sometimes got given stunt points for crashing into objects and spinning uncontrollably which doesn't really make sense\n-A few grammatical and spelling errors, obviously not everyone speaks perfect English but it can't be too hard to get someone to proof-read\n-Despite not being a mobile port (the devs are planning to port it to mobile however) it does very much feel like a game that belongs on a smartphone or tablet rather than a PC or laptop\n-The mouse cursor always stays visible, one of my major pet peeves in games\n-You can't reverse so if you crash into a wall and can't turn out of it you're forced to restart\n-You can't pause the game! Another of my major pet peeves, seriously it's 2015 and we can't pause our games?\n-As you can see from the below comment section, the dev really has no idea how to communicate with the Steam community, telling me, among other things, that I'm wrong because I disagree with him\n\nVerdict:\nAvoid it like the Plague (2/10)\n\nJet Racing Extreme is a poor mobile port that fails at what it sets out to achieve, with poor controls, sub-par graphics and a fair few other issues this game is neither worth your time nor money.\n\nNo drama, Just Reviews.\n\nEl K.","July 16, 2015","false","0.6"," 97 of 123 people (79%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","79","97","123","5","38"

However, I will.\n\nJet Racing Extreme is a Trackmania-like game. High speed (not as high as TM tho :( ), tricky physics, loops and obstacles ahead the track and a lot, A LOT of stuff that can induce rage (rage ranging from verbal rants to literally destroying your keyboard with your teeth and then pluging your cat's tail on the usb port to use as keyboard replacement).\n\nAt first it looks nice, unity 3D engine well used, decent graphics good modeling (just good) nice textures but It is still in  early access stage, so its not flawless. The lack of car options is a feature that should be fixed asap, though the (still small) possibility of customization fills that hole a little. Same goes for the available race tracks.\nSound-wise its not bad, though again it turns to be repetitive and there are no sound options available as for the time of this review is being written (I'd recomend devs, for (._.)'s sake add this urgently!)\n\nI always loved to construct stuff, but i like destruction with the same passion, and JRE has it! You can destroy your vehicle in a billion pieces (probably less, but well, sounds more destructive). This is probably the strongest point of the game, and the one that will make me recomend this game.\n\nIn conclusion: If you are a fan of destruction, then get this game, specially if it is on sale. Note that the destruction of the in game vehicle added to the crazy physics can transfer to PC peripherals, room or car destruction due to rage effects. So, if you can't afford to lose stuff stay away of this and download Trackmania instead.\n\n(._.)'s score: 45/100 - ''I enjoyed it for a little while, then i cried myself to sleep''.","December 11, 2015","true","7.7"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","92","12","13","5","1"

I find games like this a lot of fun, but this is the best of this type of game that I have found. They managed to make it extremely fun, but also realistic, so going 400 MPH and crashing into a wall actually obliterates your car.\n\nPros:\n\n-Extremely fast, and dangerous driving\n-very good destruction physics\n-Realistic, but also fun (unlike some games that are too simulater-ish)\n-a few good but challenging tracks\n-more tracks to come when out of early access\n-actual shop where you can buy parts for your car\n-you can change the look and color of your car\n\nCons:\n\n-steering can be very wonky, but when you hook a controller up, it's is slightly easier\n-going too fast will throw you off the track when going around a bend\n-not many players online (would be better if more people played)\n-when you crash your car completely, it brings up a sign, sometimes deducting you 100 points\n\nAt it's current state, the game is well worth the money as you are getting a good amount of content, but the game could be improved on quite a bit (Fix that steering!) hopefully AI will be added in future updates as it would make the game more interesting. The game is cheap, so if your looking for some fun and you don't want to spend too much, buy this now.","December 14, 2015","true","5.0"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

It seriously has some of the fastest racing I've ever experienced and the crashes are freaking spectacular! The controls however are janky as hell. Keyboard works moderately well but when you try to use a 360 controller its super sensitive and does not control well at all. You can theoretically tweak the car's controls through an option menu in game but this didn't make any difference with the controller and it apparently made the keyboard steering stop working even after I put it back to the default values.\n\nSo as it stands right now, its fun but frustrating. Though there's still alot of amusement watching yourself crash and burn over and over it does get tiresome when you want to attempt to actually complete a lap. My friend managed it, but I didn't.\n\nIn another 6 months I think this game will be fantastic and as such, I say jump on the bandwagon early because these developers deserve your money to be able to realize their vision! Just lower your expectations with the current build (Jan. 15th, 2016) and know that its currently a CCC title rather than a AAA. I'm sure it'll improve with a little developer love and community support!","January 15","true","0.8"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","9","10","0","0"

It is fun for a little bit but it is not anything special and is not worth its price. I feel like developers wanted to make a good arcade game but then mixed it with realistic damage and destruction system and it didn't match well.\n\nDetails:\n\n+ Fast-paced gameplay with nice (but somehow weird) steering. The speed one can reach here is really high and it is exciting;\n+ Destruction and damage system - it is very good, detailed thing in this game. You can damage your wheels and even get them completely destroyed and you would still be able to drive your car. That is an interesting and well-made idea;\n+ Maps are nice and interesting;\n\n+/- Car upgrades - There are many upgrades available to your vehicle parts which is nice. Although, I somehow had enough money to upgrade everything to its max level after my very first race and I did not even know why. That completely ruined the upgrade system for me. Hopefully they will change it someday in the future;\n\n- Sometimes you could get a feeling that the game is actually too fast - it is very nice to feel the speed but your vehicle always crash after touching literally anything. That is frustrating and I would rather like to enjoy the speed rather than seeing my car crashing so often in such an arcade game;\n- I feel like developer mistakenly mixed 2 different, opposite things in this game - they created realistic game if it comes to damage, destructions and physics but I did not like that - I feel like this game should be a very fast-paced arcade racer in which you could get unbelievable, enormous speeds and enjoy the fast ride without worrying about your car getting crashed that much. Unfortunately, that is impossible - your car gets destroyed everytime it touches something and it frustrates a lot - it completely removes the "arcade" thing;\n- Music is repetetive and boring. So are sound effects - honestly they were making me annoyed and I could not stand them after a while;\n- In-game purchases - the game itself is a port from mobile game but I try not to judge it by that. However, seeing in-game purchases or "Premium" versions etc. is not good. Only if the game was incredibly cheap but it is not - that is why I am surprised they even kept these in-game purchases in a PC version. That is a big NO;\n- Multiplayer seems to be dead. What is even worse, single player mode is boring - you do not even compete with any other AI-controlled cars. You just drive alone;\n- Graphics could be better;\n\nSumming up:\nI cannot recommend Jet Racing Extreme at its current state. It is not worth the price with what it offers at the moment. It has very good damage and destruction system and physics are nice. However, the thing how developer mixed arcade and realistic style is a big mistake in my opinion. I hope the game will be upgraded and more features will finally be added but as for now, I cannot recommend buying this game, especially for the full price.","November 19, 2015","false","1.2"," 14 of 24 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","14","24","0","2"

But so far the controller settings are wonky and buggy. Which made it wonky for me to play the game, which probably helped the physics feeling very very wonky.\n\nI'm not too sure I like the devs posts on the forums saying things like "Controller support works for some people and that's good enough" or "This is a hardcore game get used to [the bad controller support] or gtfo" (I'm paraphrasing not quoting ipsis literis).\n\nSo far I'm neither impressed nor hopeful. But still I hope I can change this review in the future.\n\nEdit: After some 2 hours fiddling with the controls and whatnot I've at least found a way to play with the keyboard. I hope I hadn't. The driving is just horrible. The behaviour of the car was horrendous and it kept steering by itself into obstacles. It took me a while to find out that the autopilot (?) was turning itself on at speed. You can turn it off but then: a) The car is uncontrollable; b) the a/p stays off for a little bit and then comes back on.\n\nAnd so far I haven't understood why it's called "racing", and on the menu you click on "race", yet all the scores are kept in stunt points... I don't even know the time in which I completed the circuit.\n\nI got this game for free and so far I hope I hadn't.

This is one of those Games I could spend hours playing not even caring what I'm doing just driving around crashing into walls losing tires and parts pushing the limits of every corner on the racetrack to see what I can get away with. you drive your jet car around several race tracks (providing you make it past the first gate) at top speed (at least I do)to see how far you can get.

I expect it'll be updated solidly, because the base game right now is lots of fun.\n\n+ Physics are surprising and feel great.\n+ Graphics are worth it for the asking price. (that should say more about other games than this one).\n+ Its repetitive, but intriguing at the same time. You can handle your Jet-Engine powered car, but at high speeds, you simply can't. That being said in early access. I really hope the maps increase and be able to get more upgrades.\n+ Crashing the car is more fun than driving as long as possible without a hitch xD its pretty much the Flappy Bird of Steam or the Goat Simulator of Car Racing.\n\n- Controller didn't work for me on OS X, which would boost my liking a lot more.\n- I always look for coop in such games, because they simply require more than one player to have fun. Misfortune of others would be a nice add-on xD\n\nThat being said, i really like the game and will put more hours playing it. I can't wait for the finished product.","September 30, 2015","true","2.2"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

For example, do you know what either '15000 Spring' or '300 Damper' are supposed to mean? Me either. Neither is it intuitively clear what impact bringing these numbers up or down actually do short of trial and error.\nThe 'Paint Lab' is also sort of neat, but only being able to pick a single color for the body makes it feel kind of limited.\nWhile I can figure out what the upgrades in the 'Parts Shop' are for, the insistence from the developers that there "is no in-app payments in Steam version of the game" is easily refuted by seeing that there is indeed a section in the parts shop which gives the user an option to buy barrels (in game currency unit) and upgrade packs for real money via PayPal.\nMost importantly, however, the gameplay is just not very good. While you get the sense that you're able to travel quite fast in the vehicle (and this can be quite fun for a moment), the steering and obstacles are kind of ridiculous. Any minuscule bump of an object sends the vehicle into a wild tailspin resulting in anything from the vehicle falling apart until it can no longer be driven to outright explosions. I could forgive the flaws above if the game played well, but this simply isn't the case. As funny as it can be to cause crashes and watch the vehicle fall apart after giving up on trying to 'race' properly, the novelty wears off really quickly. Even the videos promoting the game all end with some ludicrous crash sequence, tellingly enough.\nIf the issues above (or at least the gameplay) are fixed, this has the potential to be a good game. However, given that the Early Access description describes the game as 'Technically Complete' I won't be holding my breath.\n\nNote: Game was provided to me for free via orlygift.com","October 1, 2015","false","1.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I still remember the predecessor called P.O.D. many years ago but here there is just a few things about.\n\nFirst of all the car is impossible to command (at least via keyboard). You press left or right and it turns like there was a corner. In any case there is no way to properly command the car. The turbo boost make you just fall from every road. Physic is a problem here because there is no collant between the car and the road.\n\nThe play will be like this:  start -- fall out. restart -- fall out.  restart -- fall out. restart -- fall out. restart -- go around like a mini scooter speed vehicle... reach a checkpoint, start to push engine and .. fall out.\n\nLet's take a definitive decision: UNPLAYABLE.\n\nLord's Hol Napult experience: 3/10","June 3","false","0.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I could try and try to smash the joypad buttons but it simply didn't work.\n\nSecond thing - the graphics.\nI wanted to blame it all on my old laptop, that I don't like this game, but I won't do that.\nThe time of the game reaction after I press any button is just horrible. I lowered the graphic details to the minimum, knowing that my laptop is not the youngest one, and the mouse cursor was acting normally, but when I was driving and trying to take a nice turn...I've suddenly found myself flying off the course for no reason. O_o And even after I've stopped touching any buttons...the vehicle just continued to...fly? slide? drive? whatever?!\n\nIn my humble opinion: there are many more decent racing games more or less graphically complicated then this one and they give you hours of pleasure and work great. :)\n\nSorry Jet Racing Extreme, but I am giving you a thumb down.

The physics on the car are pretty cool and I appreciate how the destruction feels when you crash, that all works really well. There’s some really strange steering assist but it only seems to kick in at a certain speed, or something? My point is, I don’t understand it. But that’s fine; it works well enough because of how difficult the car is to control, and it should be. But why is there steering assist that’s so strong that it won’t let you leave the road? I really want to explore the levels this game has to offer but it fights me to stay on the track. These are all small complaints for a game that’s in early access. Things can easily change in the future and I like the concept so I’m glad I bought the game as it is because I like to see games grow. But my biggest complaint is how the makers of this game can have the nerve to include micro-transactions on an unfinished game. Not only that but these “micro”-transactions cost more than the game costs. As is, the game is worth £5 at the most. I’m glad it only cost me £1.99. I’m happy with that price.\nThis game is promising if you ignore the micro-transactions. The gameplay is on the way to being really fun. I just hope that the developer sees that this kind of game would lend itself to a free-roaming style of gameplay, but I’m not the one making the game, that’s their choice.","July 20, 2015","true","5.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Another of my major pet peeves, seriously it's 2015 and we can't pause our games?\n-As you can see from the below comment section, the dev really has no idea how to communicate with the Steam community, telling me, among other things, that I'm wrong because I disagree with him","October 2, 2015","false","0.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It is an amazing experience once you get the hang of the controls.  Improving feels rewarding.  There is a learning curve and it takes a bit of patience(be prepared to crash and have your car ruined repeatedly).  I highly recommend it though for the unique take on racing with loops, corckscrews, jumps and everything else.  Multiplayer needs more users, but I expect it to take off.

Without a controller it's useless\n\nThe worst thing:\n- lack of idea for racing. In the singleplayer mode we don't have aims like: beat the track in 1:30m to grab the gold medal or beat the enemies or don't touch any obstacle. I couldn't play multiplayer because there was no players so singleplayer is more like a training. If it would be called "Training", I would understand, but singleplayer means that there are some AI's to beat, some story to tell or smth.\n\nI decided to give a thumb up because the idea of the game is now like: go ahead, drive on our tracks and have fun. The driving itself is fun, but it needs more to be done in the singleplayer to have fun in multiplayer.","August 27, 2015","true","2.0"," 3 of 14 people (21%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","21","3","14","0","2"

The crashes are the best part of the game.\n\nThe controls are too sensitive in my opinion and you do tend to oversteer which results in a lot of airtime (and said spectacular crashes if you were moving fast enough).  The shop is nothing to speak of and you will be able to get everything maxed out in 15 minutes of play...and frankly I didn't notice that much of a difference.  They REALLY need to update that to remove the cash references.  Also need more tracks but that looks like it is still coming along so it is early yet there.\n\nThey have done a nice job on the crashes though with physics and graphics but it is likely you will play with it at hour or so and be done unless you just love racing (and crashing).\n\nDid I mention the crashing is nice?","October 2, 2015","true","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The car does need a reverse gear, as at one point I did get my nose of my car right against a rock and was unable to move since the rocketcar only goes forward.  The autopilot is able to be turned off, but sometimes it feels like it turns itself back on randomly at points.\n\nThe default camera angle is fine most of the time, but when you start messing things up is where it goes a bit wonky, the camera seems locked to look at the roof of the car always, and while that's not a horrible thing, when making sharp turns or if you get flipped over, the experience suffers.\n\nIs the game perfect right now? No, but it looks to have quite a lot of potential and if the controls are addressed I look forward to playing this game a lot more in the future!","October 1, 2015","true","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This was made worse by the fact that the controls in the beginning cover the entire screen.\n\nThe microtransaction model probably isn't the best, either.

The game itself is not terrible, but I can really spend €5 on something i'll enjoy for a longer time.\n\nThe game is fun, for the first few minutes. But then you realize you have very few options, other than playing the same few tracks (a total of 4 tracks right now, all in the same environment, and they look and feel very similar). There appear to be 8 tracks planned per map, and 4 different maps, so a grand total of 32 tracks, but I'm just reviewing the current state of the game, hopefully that means a lot more variety and fun.\n\nDriving is very hard, at times you will feel you have very little control on anything. Physics are weird too, on one side you have very good deformable car models, but on the other cars feel very "squishy". Slight impacts with objects can cause unproportionate amount of damage/deformation (i.e. taking a ramp slightly sideways to "flip" your car in the air can occasionally, and apparently randomly, simply make your car explode on contact).\n\nRacing is actually the minor part of the game. The actual challenge is to explode in a spectacular way!\n\nI'll give it a "yes" because I had fun, though it didn't last very long, but that might be mitigated in future by more tracks and stuff.","October 1, 2015","true","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The car does need a reverse gear, as at one point I did get my nose of my car right against a rock and was unable to move since the rocketcar only goes forward.  The autopilot is able to be turned off, but sometimes it feels like it turns itself back on randomly at points.\n\nThe default camera angle is fine most of the time, but when you start messing things up is where it goes a bit wonky, the camera seems locked to look at the roof of the car always, and while that's not a horrible thing, when making sharp turns or if you get flipped over, the experience suffers.\n\nIs the game perfect right now? No, but it looks to have quite a lot of potential and if the controls are addressed I look forward to playing this game a lot more in the future!","October 1, 2015","true","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There's nothing significantly wrong with it, but the fact that it's a mobile game ported to PC lends some issues.  For example there's no way to change the screen width.  This was made worse by the fact that the controls in the beginning cover the entire screen.\n\nThe microtransaction model probably isn't the best, either.  If the devs asked, I'd probably recommend setting the game's price at a couple bucks and just let it be.\n\nThe game is sub-par, but the concept is good.

The idea of driving a jet-powered car at 700km/h while using stuff like turbo jets for extra speed is cool. The HUD is also kinda cool, but the actual gameplay is honestly terrible. I'm not bad at racing games at all, but it took me about 15 minutes to get to the first checkpoint on a random track I picked. The controls are absolutely terrible and when going over 200 km/h (which feels like 50cc mariokart speed) the car won't turn properly anymore.\n\nOverall this game plays terribly and I will not recommend it at all. The concept is fun, execution is poor.\n\nIdea 9/10\nGraphics 6.5/10\nControls 0/10\nGameplay 0/10","June 5","false","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
