"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thatfuzzytiger/recommended/55040/","thatfuzzytiger","Hobbes","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thatfuzzytiger/","3197 products in account","It's called Atom Zombie Smasher. Yes, there are zombies, yes, you smash them, with atomic bombs...\nThe title is as literal as it comes, perhaps second only to NZA 2 (read my review on -that- for more details) in terms of "It does what it says on the tin". Atom Zombie smasher is a variant on those old-school top down "Zombie outbreak simulator" programs that would show lots of little dots rushing around, some were coloured as civilians, and others as zombies, over time you'd watch the infection spread throughout the city, often leaving a small clump of survivors holed up in a dead end praying to survive just another few moments.\n\nThis is the logical conclusion of that program, it's a game and a campaign structured around the outbreak simulator program, with you tasked as the last remaining commander of the available defence forces, attempting to save as many lives (and smash as many zombies) as you can. To this end you're provided with a default escape helicopter, and gradually introduced to the toolbox of mercenaries that accompany you over the course of the campaign.\n\nMore than just a zombie infection simulator...\nThe game runs two distinct "beats", the first is the strategic map, a somewhat procedurally generated vision of a large city with lots of sub districts. This map operates on something of a turn based mode, so at the beginning of a given month, the zombie AI places outbreak counters on various districts, you then select a district to fight in, and depending on the outcome the district is either still infested, cleared out, or reclaimed and made safe for humanity. So far so normal, it's important to note however that whilst you only get ONE district to fight each month, the outbreak AI gets two, and eventually three counters to use, you're fighting a losing battle overall.\n\nHowever, on the upside, you -do- get some tools at various points, in the strategic map the two major events are access to a prototype cannon (Elephantbird) that allows you to utterly eradicate a district in the tactical mode (more on this shortly), and llama bombs, which essentially decontaminate a bunch of districts in one pass, buying you much needed breathing room. Outside of this, you'll be assigned a squad of mercenaries (randomly selected from the available pool), and you'll get to choose a district to "go tactical" on.\n\nGetting down and dirty with the undead masses...\nThis is where the outbreak simulator program is most visible, in the tactical mode you're presented with a moderately simple top down view, with civilians represented in a sortof beige yellow, zeds in purple, and your forces taking up various other colours. Left unchecked, the map will play out much like the software in question, and eventually all the survivors will be gobbled up, but you've tools to prevent this!\n\nBefore the tactical map kicks off, you designate your initial landing point for your rescue chopper (equipped with foghorn that automatically attracts nearby civilians), and you set up your various mercenaries. These range from single shot items like minefields, to ongoing and mobile defences such as infantry and snipers. Effective use and the setting up of choke-points can, if done right, result in you demolishing all the zombies before nightfall and scoring a hefty bonus (indeed, these bonuses, and saving lots of survivors is your path to victory).\n\nWe have explosive...\nThe game really livens up once you've got explosives, with the map turning from an often pristine cityscape into a big brown muddy pit. Zombies exploding in clouds of green as your artillery rains down, remote dynamite detonations at key junctions reducing swarms of zombies into kibble, and your infantry protecting choke points and keeping the zeds away from the ever dwindling number of survivors. Once there are no more survivors to rescue, the scores are tallied up and you're returned to the strategic map. Learning how to adapt your tactics to an ever growing outbreak, and racing to the victory of humanity before the zeds inevitably take over forms the core of the campaign.\n\nBlendo hits one out of the park, with an off the wall look at zombie apocalypses...\nFor a simple pick up and play title, it offers an excellent level of depth, combined with an offbeat and catchy soundtrack. The graphics are not much to look at, but they do the job functionally well (think of a 3D version of that outbreak simulator and you're pretty much there). It's very easy on the system requirements and provided you don't suffer any hiccups at launch, you'll have little complaint from the game. As a cheap impulse buy, it's hard to find fault and as such, comes very much recommended.\n\nVerdict : Essential","November 27, 2013","true","18.0"," 56 of 77 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","56","77","2","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nourl1/recommended/55040/","nourl1","Two Clicks","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nourl1/","547 products in account","Atom Zombie Smasher is a super little indie strategy game.  The basic premise is that you take on the guise of a commander holding back the zombie hordes from overruning your city.\n\nIt works on two levels; first is the strategy where a map of the city districts is where you see the progress of zombie infestations and plan your next mission.  You can choose which military assets you take with you from: infantry, snipers, mines, demolitions, barricades, gas attracting teams or artillery.  Once you initiate the mission, the game changes to a tactical sub-game where you place your units on the map to best protect the civilians you are trying to extract from the map, while avoiding collateral damage.  To many dead civilians and you fail.\n\nThere are a number of tactical elements that affect each mission type such as: map layout, dangerous area which can explode if you are not careful, more or less time-limit & available/unavailable units.\n\nYou win if you extract a minimum number of civilians or your units are able to destroy the encroaching zed hordes.  However if you do not clear the map of zeds before nightfall more zeds arrive to swarm the map.  Successful missions reward you with points that go towards an overall victory target.  Units also receive XP to increase their unique zed destroying abilities and they can level up to increase those abilites to make them more clincial.\n\nThe zeds then receive strategic points allocated to some city district (1-4) which determines the strength of the zombie hordes and the difficulty of initiating a mission there.  This continues until you reach the campaign victory target.\n\nThough gameplay is fairly repetitive the addition of custom campaign options make the strategy and tactical aspects that much more varied.  Scientists can be found wondering the city area and can be rescued.  Each one can then be "spent" to acquire research upgrades towards 8 specific areas of interest including: faster xp gains for units, faster strategic weapons, resilient scientist, more destructive weapons etc).  You can have access to strategic and tactical weapons that can clear zeds from an entire district thus reseting the danger level there.  Just be aware of the monster-zeds! lol\n\nFor me this was a surprise gem of a game.  While graphics are just basic sprites, it really can grab you if you let it.  It one of the most intelligently designed games Ive ever played and almost perfectly balanced.  While the musical score and audio is fairly basic, they do a wonderful job of immersing you in unfolding events.  Best of all its a very polished game.   Even if some Mac users are having problems with playing it.\n\nIf you are after a basic but enjoyable zombie apocalypse survival simulator then you should pick up a copy when the price is right for you!","August 19, 2014","true","43.3"," 30 of 34 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","30","34","0","4"

It allows for the most accesible modding and mod creation I have seen, useful for getting any  kind of experience desired, from the easiest of easy to the most insane of modes. The cleverly designed units are great for getting different challenges, thought they can sometimes end up in such a way as to make it impossible to win. There are a variety of preset options for the game, which allow you to make the game go on indefinitely, let you pick your units and so on. All in all very cleverly designed. Even when you get bored of the normal saving civiians / killing zeds, you can play Kringlejammer the most hilariously overpowered weapon of mass destruction, with a bit of strategy to see how long you can last. It is suprisingly addictive, akin to a tower defense game but with a bit of a twist. The story behind the game is also quite odd, but provides some comic relief.\n\nWorth it's price?

Kind of like a tower defense game, but without a fixed base - the people you save are essentially what you are trying to protect!\n\nThe Campaign map or strategic view is where you begin.  Every turn zombies (Zeds) take over new territories. From these you choose a territory/city to attempt to rescue civilians from.  This will launch your team deployment phase - placing helicopter landing point etc.\n\nOnce each turn or rescue begins, you have a set number of people you have to rescue to be successful - should you fail to hit this number, you will lose that territory.  Should you succeed, it will become neutral.  Rescue during missions is achieved by clicking with the mouse to adjust landing zone for your helicopter in a way that draws the people away from the edges of the city where the Zeds emerge from.  During the daytime when rescue missions begin, this will be from marked entrances, but on sun down, more Zeds will appear from all edges of the city!!\n\nOnly people within a certain radius hear the helicopters horn and move towards it - which can later be upgrade - there is a delay until the helicopter arrives and how many people it can carry which you can also be upgraded as you progress.  You unlock new units to assist you as the campaign progresses such as mobile soldier squad, fixed artillery which you can place on a rooftop, sniper team and roadblocks to name a few.\n\nThe Zed get scored on how many people they 'convert' regardless of the outcome.  At the end of the mission you are returned to the main map, and scores are added up for yourself and the zed.  At set points totals fixed events occur, such as 'Giant Zeds' etc to spice things up a bit.  Also, depending upon the month/turn, Zed will invade other territories.  The ultimate aim being to out-score the zed in what is essentially a points race - for a large part of which you will be behind in until you discover 'Llama bombs' later in the game ;-)\n\n\nOverall it is a great little addictive strategy game, one word of warning though, it only has the one soundtrack, so if you don't like it, you may want to turn the music off altogether!","December 5, 2013","true","14.7"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

Each mission was intense and more than not, brought you to the brink of barely surviving.\n\nThe gameplay mechanics are solid, and your selection of power ups are your saving grace in most cases, though I found the basic setup strategy to still be key. Many missions however felt as though there wasn't a lot of room for experimentation on your strategy, but rather one particular set of placements would be the only route. This may have just been a personal experience, but it was observed anyhow.\n\nMy only complaint, or maybe this was intention, so instead should be a compliment was the Over Map and the constant "Won the battle, losing the war" feeling you got. It was incredibly difficult to determine which event to tackle next as you always knew that even if that battle was won, the odds were stacked against you overall on your return back to the over-map.\n\nI would still recommend giving this a go if you're a hardcore strategy fan. Although the graphics and presentation aren't awe-inspiring, the atmosphere and stylization work for this game.That coupled with solid mechanics make this a good title to round out your Steam Library.","November 10, 2013","true","1.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Except this game is a bit more deeper with an 'overrun' system, and the fact that you have several upgradeable items and teams at your disposal, which adds a certain strategy aspect to the game. The objective is to rescue as many people as you can, by using a helicopter and the previously mentioned items and teams. It can get pretty hectic, but it's so much fun. The graphics are ok, definitely not bad, but people are shown as squares so if you're looking for realism try and find some other zombie games that do a better job.

I'm not sure how I acquired this game, it likely came from a Humble Bundle or some other type of deal.  I don't usually even consider top-down indie games because so many of them are poorly done.  This is a great game.\n\nThe setting is simple, you are the government controlling troops in a Latin-america zombie apocalypse.  A very interesting settings since so much of zombie media is based in the USA.  The tools of war are not overly complicated and yet the strategy is pure and advanced.\n\nAs far as indie games go these graphics are good – granted its not really even 3d but everything is animated well.  The music is very good, its fun Latino music, but not overly brash for someone who normally dislikes that kind of music.\n\nThis is game is very good value for money because you could replay it over and over.  Even though its not a tower defense game I think this title appeals to the same sort of crowd.  I just wish I could get this on Android as I would pay $10 to get it on my phone.  The game even has a “netbook” mode for low-end machines, so I think its reasonable to think that my quad-core snap dragon could run it.","September 6, 2014","true","4.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Even better is that despite what it looks like, the game's developer did almost all of the work himself which is also a plus.\n\nMods are possible, and in fact easy to do as INIs are actually shared through Steam as well in-game.

There are some fun little tactics you can use, such as routeing the zombies towards your sniper or clustering them together for a well times artillery shot.\n\nA meta-game has you and the zombies battle for territory, lets you access new units and upgrade existing ones.

There is undoubtedly a way to beat it, but several things I prefer to have direct control over are never in the player's hands to begin with.\n\nAtom Zombie Smasher focues on rescueing civilians from zones infested with zombies. You have no control over the civilians on the ground; you can only send an evacuation helicoptor and hope all the civilians get to it in time. In order to aid you in this mission, you are given control of a random set of resources.\n\nThese resources are randomized for every mission, and it is this aspect to the game that I cannot stand. Sometimes you'll have access to attack dogs and snipers, other times you'll have mines and blockades. Rarely, all you'll have access to is blockades and a paltry 3 bombs with which to stem the zombie tide. Even worse, the challenges you'll face vary from times of day (fewer zombies in sunshine, etc) to superzombies that require a considerable effort to take down.\n\nEvery zone you lose to the zombies gets chalked up on a big scoreboard. First to a set score wins, and it's an uphill battle for any player from the start. If I had control over my resources, I might enjoy this. However, I don't so I can't.","September 11, 2014","false","1.7"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","47","8","17","2","0"

You can finish a game in about 30 minutes if you turn on the short game and don't mess it all up.\n\nSince the game is set up in the typical endless race fashion you can pick how long you want to play for, which is nice.

I've been playing it from time to time for about last 3 years (actually I've bought it during one of Humble Bundle sales and played a lot outside of steam).\n\nThe game is pure tactics stratagy, without some economics features. All you need is plan your operations, upgrade units' skills and replay a lot, untill you're able to finish a level almost perfectly.\n\nI don't know why some reviewers say that this game is "completly random blah-blah-blah", I can't find anything like that. I would hazard a guess, that they are just not good enough in hard-core tactics games. Let's say, if you don't know what it is to use quick-save a lot in X-COM (turn based stratagy series (the old one and the new one)), in Fallout 2, in Jugger Alliance, you might dislike Atom Zombie Smasher for its "hardcoreness", but if you like those games, well, I guess AZS is for you.","September 27, 2015","true","42.1"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

So based on this I feel it only fair to offer a better review.\n\nWhere to start.\nFor one this , for me, is a stupidly addictive little game. You basically have to evacuate cities of survivors using your evac helicopter and various Mercs (which you unlock along the way). Sometimes you get lucky other playthroughs you get screwed trying to clear a heavily infected city with just barricades and dynamite.\n\nThe game also offers a beautiful sense of "I'm kicking Zed butt and totaly own this game" and then turns the screw as you see the map atart to swarn with high level infected cites, more zed, exploding gas lines and the MEGA zed's.\n\nGraphics are basic but work fine with the genre of game.\nI love the music/soundtrack (kind of a 60's surf music feel).\nThe vignettes/story boards make no sense (which a lot of people have criticised) and are completely odd at times but this adds to the charm. There is alot of screaming at survivors as you near your target and they all run in the opposite direction straight into a zombie hoard.\n\nBags of replay value due to the mods and game modes availible.\n\nI have lost many hours trying new tactics, almost winning, rage quittting, starting a new game and repeat.\n\nIt's a great time killer and worth a look at once you can fix the audio error (as stated the is a fix if you look).","November 24, 2014","true","171.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Back from the olden days of Winter Sale coal and fresh indie zombie games. Actually, maybe it's more appropriate to ask if you remember that decade-old zombie simulator with the colored dots, because this is the fully gameified version of that. Humanity is on the retreat from the zombie hordes and it's up to you to evacuate the survivors from your region. You can select different infested areas from the strategic map based on the infection level (difficulty), and it takes you to a small city map where you have to plan the evacuation. You get a helicopter that airlifts folks (yellow dots) out every 20 seconds or so, and up to 3 mercenary units to help defend. These units are anything from soldiers and snipers to landmines and barricades. After each mission you AND the zombies get victory points based on the final number of survivors and zombies. New events occur as you both reach certain victory point milestones, and the first side to rack up the target number of points wins.\n\nSounds solid, right? Unfortunately, this all comes together to form a strategy game that's mostly based on random chance. Just like the old simulator, humans turn into zombies instantly when touched, and you better believe the survivors clump up around the landing zones like delicious stuffing. All it takes is one zombie escaping your best-laid deathtrap to ruin an entire map. This is further exacerbated by the fact that your 3 mercenary units are randomized for each mission. So while you're in good shape if you get your mortars and zombie baits in one mission, you're boned if you get stuck with barricades, mines, and bombs, all of which are one-use tricks. There's also random variance in the performance of your units; soldiers can miss, and your mortars can go off-target, ruining that hail mary shot you needed to save the day. There are a host of other frustrations, like how you and the zombies get points for holding territory, but you only claim territory if you kill ALL the zombies on the map before sundown, which is ludicrously difficult even if you have the right mercs for it.\n\nIt's a shame, too, because the presentation is stylish and weird, and there are some neat systems to explore like XP to improve your mercs and rescuing scientists to upgrade your other abilities. The story vignettes are compellingly strange as well and I still can't make heads or tails of the story, but I know Tesla and an antichrist baby are involved. Shame I'll never figure it out, because the game's just too damn discouraging and frustrating to get through.","September 18, 2015","false","4.4"," 27 of 56 people (48%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","48","27","56","0","0"

Reminds me quite a bit of this java zombie simulator thing I saw several years ago. For all I know it's by the same guy. Probably not though. In any  case it's a well written game. There is no huge level of depth to it in terms of plot but it's interesting and the tracks are great. I would strongly recommend waiting for this to show up in the next humble bundle or on sale. I can't compliment the game and the author's competency enough but in its present state $6 would be a better price point. It's not a matter of quality that is at issue, but the proportion of price and the scale of the game compared to others of its type. So don't let my pricing critique make it seem like the game is not worth getting, it definitely is. Just not at the present price.

In essence, you smash zombies in style. Top-down, heavy weapon style that is. You have a certain number of "months", or games to do so before you either win or lose the campaign. Here's the thing; you get to choose and use certain weapons and/or troops. Between months however, the game will forget your weapon/troop loadout. You, completely oblivious to the fact that for some reason you don't have the troops you want selected, start a new month and tataa; there you are with your wortheless landmines and barricades. Poop! Restart, you say? No can do buddy. You can end the month, lose it and end up being set back in the campaign. Do this 3-4 times and tataa; you lost the campaign. Extremely annoying!

It's a brilliant casual realtime strategy game that's tense, strategic, flexible, and most of all, a lot of fun. I've heard a few people describe it as "tower defense", but that's really pigeon-holing it and doing a disservice to a new player's expectations. It's true that a large portion of the strategy is in controlling the flow of the enemy, but it's not nearly as deterministic and simple as that implies. Also there are no towers. The feel of the game is much more about thinking on your feet, and dealing with disasters as they're unfolding in real (or slowed down) time.\n\nYou can play any way you want by modifying the campaign settings, letting you restart levels at no cost for that perfectionist victory, or turning on permadeath and a variety of difficulty mods for more intense and less forgiving sessions.\n\nThe entire game takes place in the same universe as Brendon Chung's other tiles, including Gravity Bone, 30 Flights of Loving, and Flotilla. Chung's unique humor and sensibilities come through in the form of a large number of vignettes and background articles describing the characters in and around events of the game, and the whole experience is topped off with an amazing instrumental surf rock soundtrack by The Volcanics.","April 8, 2015","true","10.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

The game is seen entirely from a bird eyes view giving you full awareness of where the survivors are and where the zombies are coming from. Over time you earn various mercenaries and items to help. Snipers, soldiers, barricades, cannons, mines, nukes, and more. These can all be leveled up over time. Saving scientists allow you to buy various extra upgrades. You might save every survivor from a city, or maybe become overwhelmed and lose. You simply move from city to city saving as much as possible. The game is a race to see who can get enough points first. You get points for saving people, clearing cities, etc. The zombies get points for eating people, taking over cities, etc. Whoever reaches the point goal wins, so the game has a board game feel.

The goal is to rescue as many non-infected as you can or destroy the zombie hordes before nightfall. You are given a basic assortment of mercenaries for offensive purposes which level up as they gain experience, and it's only after they start leveling that the game's fun factor is uncovered; just watch out for the friendly fire!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aerothorn/recommended/55040/","aerothorn","Aerothorn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aerothorn/","830 products in account","2011 was an amazing year for PC games. Sadly, this means a few great titles have been overlooked amidst the flurry of releases. Atom Zombie Smasher is the best of them. Developer Brandon Chung has always been a master of style - even his student game Barista 2 has more spunk than most commercial releases - and in Atom Zombie Smasher that style really meshes with the gameplay.

I love zombies already, and tower defense games. This game isn't really tower defense, though it shares some concepts from it. In this game you  try and save as many people from zombies as you can, dropping an evac copter down and covering with artillary and infantry, etc. One of the cool things is it has lots of mods, and the mod list and picker is all integrated into the game. Takes exactly 1 click to download a mod, and then another one to activate it. Plus you can tweak the game options when starting a game to make it super easy or super hard or anything in between, so its easy to customize your experience.

It took me a while to beat this one.  There's what I call a "tipping point" to this game where you will know whether you can win the game or not.  If you're not doing well, you'll know after a few levels that there is no way to come back from the deficit. A few times, I made it halfway through to only realize I would probably lose at the end...very frustrating. You need points and to do well to gain experience for your troops, more experience means your troops will perform better which will be key to winning. If you just happend to skate by each level, that won't be enough to dominate.\n\nAnyway, I didn't like this game at first, but got into it to earn the achievements.

Instead of a few skills needed to be in very stratigic locations.  In addition, you cannot use the same skills two levels in a row because they are "on missions".  I'd only recommend it if you dig this sort of thing.  Watch a youtube video and consider the purchase since its obviously not for everyone.","June 20, 2011","true","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I personally think the game fundamentals are solid, but you have to look past the cheesy graphics. The overall impression I get is Risk meets Choplifter with minimal tower defense and real time strategy elements.\n\nThere is technically no way to win--there are only degrees of losing. The goal is to rescue as many non-infected as you can or destroy the zombie hordes before nightfall. You are given a basic assortment of mercenaries for offensive purposes which level up as they gain experience, and it's only after they start leveling that the game's fun factor is uncovered; just watch out for the friendly fire! Achievements are always a plus. The price tag is a bit on the heavy side for my expectations, but it would be wise to download the demo and judge for yourself. Overall, I found it to be a refreshing distraction.","August 23, 2011","true","27.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Sadly, this means a few great titles have been overlooked amidst the flurry of releases. Atom Zombie Smasher is the best of them. Developer Brandon Chung has always been a master of style - even his student game Barista 2 has more spunk than most commercial releases - and in Atom Zombie Smasher that style really meshes with the gameplay. The randomly-selected narrative vignettes are amusing, but this is a game that tells its story almost entirely through its gameplay. This is a real, horrifying zombie apocalypse, viewed with a clinical distance. You will try and save Nuevo Aires. You will lose.

The overworld plays a bit like Risk. The city sections play very differently depending on what weapons you have available, and this is random. If you have artillery and snipers, it's not too hard to annihilate the zombies quickly. If you have roadblocks and bait, then you need to get everyone out quickly.\n\nI've definitely enjoyed it so far. The biggest flaws are its weak tutorial and the fact that a bad choice of random weapons might force you to concede a map. But, the strategy's good and it's fun to play. I haven't tried the local co-op yet... seems fun though.\n\nIf you like strategy games, I think this is worth picking up, but your milage may vary.","August 16, 2011","true","16.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is a bird's eye view zombie evacuation game, with qualities of a tower defense game.\n\nYour goal is to evacuate citizens from various citeis of a country during a zombie outbreak. The more citizens you save, the higher your score and the more upgrades you can unlock. You have multiple weapons and tools available at your disposal to use, though these are randomly assigned to you. This is because, in my eyes, you have an entire country to defend and evacuate, as the zombies spread at an alarming rate (go figure: they are zombies) and the situation can quickly turn very bad.\n\nI found the game to be very strategic in certain instances, and less so in others. This winds up being the best strength and worst weakness of the game at the same time. When given random sets of gear, sometimes you are underpowered and stand little hope, sometimes you are given overpowered ones and it is too easy (you can sometimes have a weapon set that lets you airstrike the entire city, once you upgrade them enough: how fun and challenging), and sometimes you have a set where it is possible to succeed, but forces you to think, plan, and change tactics mid game. This is when it is at its most fun.\n\nYou are able to set up a customized game if you wish, to add further challenge and some replayability. In the end though, Atom Zombie Shasher is not a long term game. It is one to play for a bit, then uninstall, then come back to on occasion once you are itching to try again.\n\nI recommend this game as long as you know are aware of that fact. Atom Zombie Smasher has a very limited way to play it, but it sure is fun for the first few times you do it. Approaching the situation as if you were actually evacuating cities from a zombie outbreak is pretty fun, and you definitely can't save everyone which adds an element of realism to a very goofy game. Don't expect to play it for 20+ hours or anything, but as a once in a while game it does its job very well. If you can find it in a humble bundle or on sale for a buck or two, it is definitely worth it.","February 2, 2014","true","7.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

First playthrough I unlocked barriers and mines and such first.  Made it really tough to progress.  Second time I unlocked soldiers first and the game just opened up.

You are scored based on how many civilians you rescue, how many zombies you kill and how quickly you achieve this.\nThe storyline campaign features a map of Nuevos Aires divided into regions (the number of regions can be edited according to how long you want to play for or what target score you set). Regions are coloured according to whether they are infested with zombies, have been liberated by you or have had all the life bombed out of them. Regions are also numbered to show the extent of zombie infestation, with higher numbers indicating a larger number of zombies to kill.\nYou have access to a helicopter (which airlifts people to safety) and then attack units to use to help you kill zombies. Attack units include ground infantry, snipers, dynamite, road blocks, etc, but you can only use 4 attack units at a time. Once you have chosen a region, you launch into a square map with randomly placed buildings, roads and civilians. You will be shown where zombies will approach from and asked to place your units on the map in strategically chosen locations. When you're done, you watch as the zombies move in and the level commences. You can move a few units after placing them, but not for most of them, so you have to really think hard about where you put them.\nThere are comic book style cutscenes which appear randomly and explain the game's backstory. The cutscenes have a certain brand of dark humour which I find hilarious, but some people might not appreciate.\nYou can also adjust game settings to make things easier or harder depending on what you want to get out of the game. For example, you can start out with all attack units, allow zombies to spawn inside a region, allow mega zombies, etc.\nOverall, this is a game worth looking at if you like strategy games.","December 28, 2012","true","24.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, each level you complete gains you a new weapon against the zombies, from mortars, to landmines and dynamite, to infantry and even road blocks as well.\nStrategic placement of all the pieces is important, as it in game adjustments where needed.\nAs the game goes on, things will change, such as orbital cannon for your use, and greater numbers of undead.","March 17, 2011","true","7.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You fight to stay ahead of the zombies in kill count, playing from one area under distress alert to the next.\n\nThe maps I've seen so far are flawed only in that they are all slightly different urban settings. I would have liked to see some maps with river, forest, field, etc to bring some unique yet better range of simulation to the game.\n\nThey did a good job on implementing a simple style that I feel is effective. You get more troops like snipers and mortar team and upgrades to your heli and troops as you progress.\n\nIt was a nice touch that you can name each group of troops that joins you as you progress, so you can have some fun with that also.\n\n\nIf this isn't your kind of game or you are unsure if it would be, try the demo.","November 28, 2013","true","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Randomly generated scenarios constantly force players to rethink strategies from one turn to the next, giving the whole thing an impressive amount of depth, while a variety of customizable gameplay parameters allow you to tailor the game to your particular tastes and skill level.\nIt's damned clever, highly replayable, and dirt cheap: buy this.","September 20, 2011","true","17.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The audio and music is extremely immersing.\nControls: 3/5\nThe majority of the controls are LMB/RMB, however it can be easy at times to confuse which one to use which can cost you a round.  Of course, you can always replay the round if you can't accept defeat.\nGameplay: 5/5\nHealthy balance of luck and skill.\nEntertainment: 4/5\nChallenges the brain. Objectives evolve as you progress.  Not very rewarding if you win the campaign, however.\nReplayability: 2/5\nThe enjoyment I get out of the actual gameplay is what brought me back for a little while.  The Steam achievements contributed to replayability.  The lack of reward to winning the campaign along with the game just getting old quickly puts a low score in this criteria.\n\nFor the small amount that Atom Zombie Smasher presents, it presents it very well.  Blendo Games gives a small package with rich flavor in the market of zombie infestations.  From the 60's SoCo surfer music (my favorite touch by the way) to the evolution of your objectives as the game progresses, Smasher will keep you thrilled in your entire experience and just may have you asking for more.... But don't expect to be racking up 100+ hours on this game.  I feel like I got everything out of it in the 25 hours I played it.  I see myself revisiting the game for a campaign or two, however.\n\nI couldn't help but to be reminded of the old Atari games like Combat, M.A.S.H., and ChopLifter when playing this game.  You find yourself evacuating civilians in the form of yellow dots by helicopter in an urban theatre from a horde of zombies, or Zed, represented as pink-purple dots.  As the campaign progresses, you find your mission objectives evolving from evacuation to Zed elimination.\n\nBlendo Games delivers a game that challenges your brain as you are concerned with concepts like Zed/Civilian routing and great timing to meet your mission objectives.\n\nAlthough the overall campaign is solid, I was disappointed on the outcome.  You are presented the same ending whether you win or lose.  I feel as though there is little reward for actually winning the game short of giving yourself a soft pat on the back on close calls.  This leads to the lackluster of the replayability of Atom Zombie Smasher.  As you get better at the game, you may find the game too easy.  The parameters in the game you can set in the beginning of the game could spice things up but overall it's the same game, just way easier or way harder.\n\nThe cherry on the top to my recommendation is the price tag. When the game is on sell, you should grab it and give it a try.  You will find it was worth more than a burger at a fast food joint.  For a small brain game (a la Minesweeper) this game is fantastic.","December 28, 2013","true","25.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

My advice is to try out the demo because it is hard to put how this game really works. Your objective is to rescue survivors of  zombie outbreaks all across the campaign map. These outbreaks take place in cities where you land helicopters, deploy infantry and snipers, set traps, and use artillery to make sure as many survivors are rescued as possible from the...purple dots. The game has a catchy but somewhat repetative soundtrack but the gameplay makes up for it. It also has some strange "humor", as articles that have nothing to do with anything and make no sense pop up on the screen. Most of the game seems to be based on books and movies I've never read or even heard of, so I feel somewhat lost on the whole setting..but I think that might be the point. The game has little visuals but imagination makes up for what graphics don't as you have to imagine why these survivors react the way they do.

Not hard to survive each map, but not easy to capture territory.\n\nB-.","November 6, 2012","true","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The audio and music is extremely immersing.\nControls: 3/5\nThe majority of the controls are LMB/RMB, however it can be easy at times to confuse which one to use which can cost you a round.  Of course, you can always replay the round if you can't accept defeat.\nGameplay: 5/5\nHealthy balance of luck and skill.\nEntertainment: 4/5\nChallenges the brain. Objectives evolve as you progress.  Not very rewarding if you win the campaign, however.\nReplayability: 2/5\nThe enjoyment I get out of the actual gameplay is what brought me back for a little while.  The Steam achievements contributed to replayability.  The lack of reward to winning the campaign along with the game just getting old quickly puts a low score in this criteria.\n\nFor the small amount that Atom Zombie Smasher presents, it presents it very well.  Blendo Games gives a small package with rich flavor in the market of zombie infestations.  From the 60's SoCo surfer music (my favorite touch by the way) to the evolution of your objectives as the game progresses, Smasher will keep you thrilled in your entire experience and just may have you asking for more.... But don't expect to be racking up 100+ hours on this game.  I feel like I got everything out of it in the 25 hours I played it.  I see myself revisiting the game for a campaign or two, however.\n\nI couldn't help but to be reminded of the old Atari games like Combat, M.A.S.H., and ChopLifter when playing this game.  You find yourself evacuating civilians in the form of yellow dots by helicopter in an urban theatre from a horde of zombies, or Zed, represented as pink-purple dots.  As the campaign progresses, you find your mission objectives evolving from evacuation to Zed elimination.\n\nBlendo Games delivers a game that challenges your brain as you are concerned with concepts like Zed/Civilian routing and great timing to meet your mission objectives.\n\nAlthough the overall campaign is solid, I was disappointed on the outcome.  You are presented the same ending whether you win or lose.  I feel as though there is little reward for actually winning the game short of giving yourself a soft pat on the back on close calls.  This leads to the lackluster of the replayability of Atom Zombie Smasher.  As you get better at the game, you may find the game too easy.  The parameters in the game you can set in the beginning of the game could spice things up but overall it's the same game, just way easier or way harder.\n\nThe cherry on the top to my recommendation is the price tag. When the game is on sell, you should grab it and give it a try.  You will find it was worth more than a burger at a fast food joint.  For a small brain game (a la Minesweeper) this game is fantastic.","December 28, 2013","true","25.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is really addictive, twitchy strategy, and you have more choice than you might realize when you set up a game -- you can choose whether you want random mercs for a greater challenge, or choose your teams, or add options to make it even harder, and a longer or shorter game may grant you more victories based on your play style. If you're frustrated, just change the options. Cute story, kind of nonsensically artsy, think Monty Python surrealism as told by Quentin Tarantino.\n\nThat being said, it can be kinda tricky to set up to run in the first place -- you might not have any problems, but based on your system, you may also sit there for an hour trying out different graphics and launch options through the forums and the dev FAQ before it runs, or before you can actually see the whole screen. Be patient, it's worth it, you'll probably get it running, but be prepared that you may need to figure out how to launch it. Not DOS-game hard to set up, but requiring more persistence than most modern games.","May 23, 2015","true","32.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a brilliant casual realtime strategy game that's tense, strategic, flexible, and most of all, a lot of fun. I've heard a few people describe it as "tower defense", but that's really pigeon-holing it and doing a disservice to a new player's expectations. It's true that a large portion of the strategy is in controlling the flow of the enemy, but it's not nearly as deterministic and simple as that implies. Also there are no towers. The feel of the game is much more about thinking on your feet, and dealing with disasters as they're unfolding in real (or slowed down) time.\n\nYou can play any way you want by modifying the campaign settings, letting you restart levels at no cost for that perfectionist victory, or turning on permadeath and a variety of difficulty mods for more intense and less forgiving sessions.\n\nThe entire game takes place in the same universe as Brendon Chung's other tiles, including Gravity Bone, 30 Flights of Loving, and Flotilla. Chung's unique humor and sensibilities come through in the form of a large number of vignettes and background articles describing the characters in and around events of the game, and the whole experience is topped off with an amazing instrumental surf rock soundtrack by The Volcanics.","April 8, 2015","true","10.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

We now have more zombie games than we can count on all our fingers... AND toes; but Atom Zombie Smasher is different from most zombie games. While some zombie games focus on a run and gun style of game play and other focus more on strategically eliminating zombies with guns, this game is more of a puzzle/strategy hybrid style.\n\nThe goal of the game is to strategically evacuate as many civillians from each region as possible; in your arsenal you are given many different ways of eliminating zombies: mines, artillary, marines, a helicopter to airlift the civillians out and more. Depending on how you use each unit, they will level up, and saving a certain amount of people eliminates all the zombies in a region, giving the region over to you. As the game progresses, you and the zombies get more powerful; the more regions owned by each "faction" the more powerful they get. This game relies on planning your actions out and a mistake early on can really cost you in the end.\n\nThere's nothing quite like this game out there and I would recommend it to anyone who likes puzzle games where the rules and obstacles aren't set in stone and random variables help keep you thinking on your feet. Very fun indeed!","August 29, 2014","true","9.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In it's own way it is very much a simple puzzler.\n\nThe game is divided into two areas. First there is the overworld map where land is divided into provinces for you to contest over with the zombie menace. Here you choose which area to send your mercenaries to infected provinces of varying difficulty (number of infected present) and, depending on the game settings you chose, choosing which mercenaries to send. Second is the battle map itself. Here you get to place where your rescue chopper will initally land and draw survivors towards it as well as other mercenaries in building around the map (artillery, snipers, etc) or deployed in the streets (foot soldiers, mines, dynamite, barricades, etc).\n\nMercenaries are all designed to help you control flow and rescue survivors and scientists from the infected zones. Helicopter for rescue, artillery, foot soldiers, snipers, barricades, mines and dynamite are all examples of some of the mercs you get to use. As you attain kills or successful rescue numbers each merc group will level up and be upgradeable. This generally comes down to faster movement, rate of fire, deployment or reduced loading times.\n\nAs the game progresses and you rescue more scientists you gain control of the 'Llama Cannon" which allows for orbital bombardment of a zone every few provinces.\n\nAll in all the game is fun and can be addictive depending on your tastes.\nPick this up in a sale and you certainly won't regret it!\n","January 23, 2015","true","13.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You have a minimum amount of people to rescue on each level and anyone touched by a zombie instantly becomes one themselves. This can prove disastrous when you have the majority of the people on the map waiting at your landing zone and a lone zombie comes in and converts the entire lot of them. This really makes you plan your unit placement very carefully, which is really the core gameplay. After the match starts there’s usually not all that much to do but watch, save for a few actions such as changing your landing zone location or redirecting your snipers cover area.\n\nI was surprised by how much I enjoyed this game, this is not even a genre I would consider my favorite. There are quite a few game modes to choose from but I found the game to be very easy if you opt to be able to pick which units you use every match. I found being forced to come up with new strategies when the units were selected randomly to really be the main challenge and fun of the game.\n\n-Playtime-\nThe game is a lot of fun for a fairly short amount of time. While you can play as many campaigns as you want with varying game modes, the core gameplay doesn’t really change much and the game will probably wear out its welcome after about 10-15 hours.\n\n-Achievements-\nNothing that different from what you would do during normal gameplay, most are just accumulative achievements. Luring massive hordes with Bait into waiting Dynamite for its kill achievement was fun though. 100% becomes a grind for the 500 Gold Medals, once you have Artillery built up a matches can take less than a minute each but it's still a grind.\n\nRecommended on sale.","March 28","true","48.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Zombies are invading the 1960s city of Nuevos Aires, and you are tasked with evacuating the populace from each district from your orbital platform.\n\nEach month, you can take on one mission and try to rescue as many civilians as possible.  Everything is procedurally generated, from the city limits to the levels to even the names of your mercenary squadrons.\n\nThe city grid is full of little yellow cubes, which represent citizens.  Zombies will come pouring in from side streets in a wave of purple cubes.  If they touch a citizen, it will instantly be turned.  A sure-fire victory can be instantly turned to defeat by one lone zed wandering into a clump of defenseless people.  You’ll need to mitigate this risk by carefully deploying and directing your troops.\n\nAs the game goes on, you’ll receive new and interesting units to deploy, though you’ll only get a random assortment of them each round.  This keeps things challenging, as you can’t take on a completely infested level with just a single mortar.  You’ll need to decide each round how hard of a level you think you can complete with your ever-changing arsenal.  Your different units can level up and improve their capabilities, and you can even recruit scientists to give you some bonus powers.  The Llama bombs are especially game-changing.   You only have a set time to evacuate citizens before night falls and zeds come pouring in from every angle, almost ensuring any remaining citizens will die.  This puts a soft cap on the length of time a level can take; most will last 3 minutes or less.\n\nLet’s talk about that music!  A handful of upbeat, cheerful tracks of what I would term “Beach Rock” add a layer of dissonance to the disturbing proceedings taking place below.  Jamming guitars and pounding drums make you so happy to be mowing down zombies and abandoning people to die just so you can save a few others!  But its OK, you’ll say, because they’re just cubes anyway.  They turn purple.  That’s a nice color.\n\nThe campaign mode offers a big list of customization options so you can set it to be as hard or as breezy as you’d like.  You can also remove some of the randomization and select your squads at the beginning of each month, which is a feature I really liked.  Oh, and there’s also a set of backstory vignettes you can collect to tell you about the history of Nuevos Aires and how the outbreak occurred.\n\nAtom Zombie Smasher is a weird, cheerful, bright zombie-slaying game.  Sometimes you just need to rescue some little cubes from certain death, blowing up other cubes to buy some time.

From the game's surf soundtrack, to it's hokey comic vignetttes, to the ridiculous randomized names of your squads, to the foghorn of the rescue chopper, everything is a little off kilter. The thing is, this game has a lot going for it in my eyes. The gameplay is absolutely on point. From the macro boardgame map where every mission you do effects the spread of the zombies and how many points you gain towards overall campaign victory, to the micro boards, where every second your snipers can fire and every scientist you can rescue on a mission matters. The game has both a planning phase and an action phase. The planning phase takes place before the mission begins in full, and allows you to place all your units, some which you can move later, and some which you can't. You'll have to be careful though because they CAN be killed, and barriers can be avoided if a gas line ruptures and the following building collapse eliminates your chokepoint. Then, in the action phase, the zombies start flooding in, the chopper flies over, and you can start blowing things up with your artillery. The random city designs force you to think critically and adapt on every single level, and if you're playing with base game rules, the rotation of available squads will also force you to get good at more than one playstyle. I don't want to spoil too much, because I found a lot of the fun came in the surprises of the new challenges presented as the campaign progressed, and the new troops and comics you unlock while playing. I really respect what was done with the base game, but if you don't like it, you can change pretty much any setting you could think of, and if not, there's a simple ingame mod system which can change even more stuff, if you like. Altogether pretty brilliant, and if nothing else, you should really try the demo for a sample and to check that it runs well on your PC. 8.5/10 because of how refreshing and exciting it was.","June 11, 2015","true","32.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You use a helicopter to round up nearby survivors and evacate them while you're mercs hold off the zombies. Not all mercs are purely combative though. You have infantry, snipers, and artillery but there are other units like the zombie bait or barricades that don't kill the zombies but rather slow them down. They can also level up and you can select permenant upgrades for them. This game has a uniquie art style and music and although the gameplay graphics are simplistic (purple boxes = zombies, yellow boxes = survivors) it's somewhat charming.\n\nOverall, its a fun strategy game with a zombie twist which is rare.","July 9, 2011","true","5.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The player places units, barricades, and explosives in the planning stage, then during the real-time portion maneuvers/uses them in order to slow the zombies from reaching the civilians before they can be rescued. As missions go by, the player acquires a larger arsenal, points with which to upgrade the various units, and new mission types. Zombie incursions increase in size and difficulty in discrete stages.\n\nIs it playable? (Barely/Mostly/Completely)\nCompletely.\n\nBugs?\nNone.\n\nUser Interface?\nEasy to use and straightforward.\n\nHow good is it? (Terrible/Bad/0k/Good/Great)\nGood\n\nAudio?\nSatisfactory explosions, gunfire, sirens, etc. The music had a generally Latin feel. The audio enhanced the gaming experience.\n\nVisuals?\nColorful art style. Comic-style drawings used to help convey story points. Game map visually basic, with zombies and units represented simply for maximum visibility. Not visually impressive.\n\nStory?\nBarely there. Your Mileage May Very whether that's a good or bad thing. Personally, I think zombie stories are usually silly, and so the lack of a more substantial treatment is no big loss and even opened room for player-driven narrative stemming from mechanical interaction during missions. Zombies happen. You defend against them and eventually destroy them entirely. 20 lines of story.\n\nMechanics?\nSolid and varied enough for several hours of fun. Sometimes the random selection of units made available in the vanilla game proved frustrating, as it is impossible to win with some combinations. On the other hand, playing with certain of the non-vanilla boxes ticked made the game much too easy (especially the ability to select whichever units you want for every mission).\n\nVerdict:\nRecommend","November 28, 2015","true","25.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
