You do this until you inevitably get chomped in half by a creature that will spawn under you before you have enough time to kill it.\n\nThere are no other movement options besides walking left or right, creating a very uninteresting playing field. Enemies spawn on both sides of you, eventually forcing you into an inescapable sandwich that will kill you in a matter of seconds. Of course, that's assuming you make it past the first minute without getting one-shotted by the lanky monochrome zombies.\n\nThere's a "challenge mode" as well where you pick from 5 different challenges that start you with weapon/equipment presets, but nothing changes. You still shoot at some plain creatures with a plain background with plain weaponry.\n\nSome of the weapon and character sprites are done decently for being created in what looks like MS Paint, but other than that, there is not much to look at.\n\nAs for the soundtrack, you have a lyrical rock track or an instrumental industrial track. Both of them achieve the "2006 flash game" theme very well.\n\nUnless you want to spend money on something you'll regret sooner or later, there is no reason to buy this.","August 10, 2015","false","0.1"," 316 of 414 people (76%) found this review helpful 28 people found this review funny","76","316","414","28","7"

Call of Tomsk-7 is an incredibly simple side-scrolling shooter that puts you in an empty arena to shoot three kinds of monsters until you die. There are zombie things to shoot in the head, bugs to one-shot, and hive zombies to explode before they swarm you with bugs. You move with the A and D keys and aim with the mouse, but without obstacles or more complex enemies you can pretty much stand still and point & click. Well, you might have to dance around because the bullet physics are weak and wonky, leaving your guns feeling more like Nerf armaments lobbing foam balls than actual deadly weapons.\n\nThere are outfits and guns to unlock, but they depend on beating certain high scores instead of accumulating points over time. This means it's entirely possible to hit your skill ceiling very quickly, with little prospect of unlocking further upgrades. You have grenades and such to help with your shooting, and airstrikes you can call in if you survive long enough. All of this just helps you last a little bit longer against the same boring enemies. The graphics look like they were cranked out in MSPaint with about five frames of animation apiece, the sound effects lack impact, and the music is some inexplicable garage rock. It's not hard to find free games with better design and higher production values than this, and believe me, I encourage you to find them.","November 10, 2015","false","0.3"," 18 of 29 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","18","29","0","0"

If you manage to get a high enough score you can unlock new weapons and new hats (which give you bonuses).\n\nThe gameplay is not that bad but since there is only 1 level and only 3 enemies you will probably get bored with it pretty soon. The game does come with some great soundtracks (3 in total) but it's not enough to save this game in my opinion.\n\n","September 6, 2015","false","1.0"," 18 of 30 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","18","30","0","0"

It really does great by sticking to the base COD formula, but changing it up enough to be worthy of a new game.\n\nWhile I haven't played through the singleplayer entirely, multiplayer is quite enjoyable and it's really cool to master the exosuit movement.\n\nMultiplayer works well, with the scorestreak system back in (and modifiable scorestreaks), with a great pick-13 loadout system, and the cool new weapons to try out. The EM-1 is cool to use, and SMGs don't feel overpowered in this game with ARs being a great choice for an all-around weapon, as they should be.\n\nIn regards to optimisation the game runs a lot better than the previous game, COD: Ghosts, and looks pretty nice too. It's not record-breaking but it has some solid visuals for performance, especially with the latest AMD drivers beta.\n\nHowever, as many others have stated, the current lack of dedicated servers (when we were promised them) is quite a worry and many matches are quite laggy. However the game is really fun, and this problem can be circumvented by modifying the max ping to join (the default is about 800-900, but if you change it down to 200 you will rarely have a laggy match).\n\n\nEDIT: The game's multiplayer aspect is much improved & smoother after the recent patch (both game patch & drivers patches), I really urge you to try it out if you have dismissed this game as laggy.\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/CodAW/comments/2lwpr4/psa_amd_drivers_and_game_update_pc/\n","September 1, 2015","true","1.4"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","33","3","9","3","0"

All of the reviews that are showing on the page are Negative, and this game is pretty much sh*t IMO.  If if wasn't so buggy, then it'd be okay for what it is.  Now, it may STILL not be worth actual money, but that's a different argument.\n\nEvery single time I've attempted to make the game full-screen (either thru maximizing the window, or from the menu option) it has screwed up, causing me to have to close out the game via my toolbar.  The controls are jerky, and some of the (fixed) keybindings are unintuitive.  Options do not save from one play to the next -- and for a game that clearly saves high scores this is both unacceptable and inexplicable.\n\nThe whole premise and aesthetic of the game just seems kinda cheesy to me, too.  If you can call in helicopter air-drops, why would ONE guy be attempting this mission -- just bomb the f*ckers!  Anyway, obviously video games do not need to be realistic to be fun.  But I don't personally find this game fun at all... and the setting here, and the way it is represented, is just bland and uninspired.\n\nThe enemies are just WAY too few and far between at the beginning of the game, with the zombies being absolute bullet sponges.  The game would have greatly benefitted from more enemies (and less *boring* walking left) which can take far less than an entire clip before dying.\n\nIt just has almost nothing to recommend it over the other games in my library.

I've been laughing my self silly trying to kill those nasty little head eating guys. I hate how the some of the monsters can spawn right next to you and and then sprint to you so you can't run away but it's still hilarious to see your guy run out of ammo when he only needs one more shot to kill it. Seems like it was originally a flash game that they decided to sell because everything seems like it was drawn in MS paint and animated by simple software but I think they kind of adds charm. It definitely reminds me of those early 2000's flash games that made up my middle school and high school computer labs. Rather than doing the assignments, I was too busy plugging away zombies on Last Stand or browsing new releases on Newgrounds (Good times). Either way, it's nice side-scrolling monster shooting fun with a decent selection of weapons, a nice soundtrack and lots of replayability.

Can't really tell if it is worth it or not. I do agree that there are some free flash games better than Call of Tomsk-7. But I also do agree with some more work and effort, this can be an amazing game. I truly see some potential in this game.\n\nThis game only has 3 enemies to fight, each with their own little ways of attacks. I don't really know what these enemies are since they look like something from Dead Space. I'll just say they are zombies.\n\nThere is this tall white creature that will eat you in one bite if it gets to close. Make sure to shoot it's head, if you don't, you better shoot it's head next time you shoot at it.\n\nNext there is this, I guess it's some sort of hive zombie. They release these creepy zombie flies. If you kill them they melt and unleash a bunch of zombie flies.\n\nLast are these zombie flies. They come in large numbers and eat your brain.\n\nThis game has a five different guns to choose from. Each with a different rate of fire, clip size, and damage output.\n\nThere is also four different equipment to use: Molotovs, Bug/Gas Grenades, Hatchets, and Land Mines. They all have uses in certain situations.\n\nHats/Upgrades take place in this game as well. Hats give you an upgrade of some sort, such as a lot of extra hatchets or increased movement speed.\n\nThe game has a challenge mode. Though unfortunatly these are pretty much the same as the regular game. You can't choose anything, all it does is throw you in the map with a certain weapon and some equipment and survive as long as you can with what you have, because you cannot call in the helicopter for more ammo.\n\nA few things I find about the game is the weapons themselves. Each bullet you shoot feels like a rock. They travel slowly and drop like a rock. (Not saying I don't like this, I just find it weird to even call something like that a bullet.) Whenever a bug gets on your head you must spam E to get it off. E also happens to be the key to call in the chopper. Which means that momentum I was trying to get for a level 3 supply drop is now a level 1 or 2.\n\nSome improvements that can be made: New weapons and enemies are always welcome. A new background might help a bit. The enemies spawn(like the hive and tall thing)could use a little polishing, sometimes they spawn right on top of you. Co-op mode might be pretty awesome.\n\nI think this game overall is nothing impressing, but truly can be something awesome. I think it deserves a 5/10. For a cheap price and easy to handle game for most computers.\n","August 16, 2015","true","5.6"," 16 of 67 people (24%) found this review helpful","24","16","67","0","1"

It's a simple little thing, walking left and right, some challenges to unlock weapons and headgear, only a few enemy types, but for what it is I like it. It starts slowly, but once the enemies start really spawning, and the screen gets flooded with the little fly creatures, and you're struggling to conserve enough ammo and survive long enough to call in a resupply, debating if you should call it now or wait to get the bigger drop later... it's an addicting little thing.\n\nIt's laugh for a couple hours, and that's enough for me to throw a few pennies at the creator for my enjoyment. For the price of a candy bar, this is worth it to me.","August 14, 2015","true","0.9"," 28 of 102 people (27%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","27","28","102","4","0"
