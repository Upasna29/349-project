Instead of battling another opponent, you instead have to use rooks, knights, and bishops to stop an infinite horde of pawns in a turn-based manner, just like Chess! The game get very tricky later on when using special powers or reviving pieces and it's a cool game to play if you have free time. Gigachess is definitely worth taking a look at if you like Chess.\n\nAnd if you have no one to play chess with you. ._.","February 3","true","1.1"," 16 of 16 people (100%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","100","16","16","5","2"

Deviously tricky in some of the puzzles, and nice and relaxing playing in Endless mode.\n\nAll in all, it's enjoyable and that makes it well worth the modest price if you're looking for something a little *different*.\n\n*edit* The devs are quick to respond and iron out any flaws, my minor grievances have already been addressed and it's playing very well.","December 16, 2015","true","5.0"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","0"

The game itself is interesting because it takes the rules of chess and makes it into a game of it's own, which it being both challenging and fun to play.\n\nGameplayThis game is rather clever, with the way that it takes the game of chess and twists it in a way that makes it both fun yet challenging to play. The basics of the game are that your chess pieces can be either a Bishop, Rook or a knight. Your enemies are a number of pawns which you must take out before they reach the end of the chess board and take a life from you. That's basically the whole game.\n\nAlthough it doesn't seem that much, this game only has to two different types of gameplay. This doesn't mean to  say that the game is limited to it's gameplay value, that would be an understatement to say the least. These two modes that are in the game are Endless and Puzzle mode, puzzle mode creates a scenario and you have to try to take out the pawns before they get to the end. Endless mode, you are able to choose 4 pieces and try to defeat as many pawns as you can before you run out of lives.\n\nIn endless mode you can choose 4 pieces and your objective is to take out as many pawns as you can before they reach the end and take all of your lives away. The game makes you think about where you would move and how that would affect the gameplay altogether, much like a game of chess. You will be presented wave after wave with a number of pawns that you must take out in order to succeed. The pawns are laid out differently each time, usually only on the first two rows in order to try to take some of your pieces.\n\nWith endless mode, you are given the choice of four different types of difficulties depending on how advanced you are with the game, Novice, Medium, Expert and Master. Novice runs at a slow rate, you are able to take out the pawns easily and have a move or two to get your pieces set up. Medium is a bit more of a faster pace, making you have to think more and spawning the next wave more quickly. Expert seems to be the same pace as Medium, but they add a new type of pawn that flashes and jumps two spaces forward each turn, as for Master, every turn a new wave spawns. A bit of overkill on the difficulty if you ask me.\n\nThe game also includes power ups that you can use by collecting enough SP by killing the amount of pawns with the amount of pieces you have in a single turn. These power ups give you the ability to block the pawns for a few turns, makes one of your chess pieces move in the sense that it was a queen for a turn and a mine that you get to place down and blow up a pawn. So overall there is a nice variety of powerups that you can use to help you play through endless mode.\n\nPuzzle mode is what you would expect it to be. You are given a set of pieces and have to try to take out the pawns before they get to the other side. This time you are only given a single life, so each move is crucial in order to succeed. There are around 48 puzzles for you to complete. But they only unlock 8 at a time after you have completed the previous 8 puzzles. For me this can sometimes limit the way that I play the puzzle mode, as I get discouraged by playing a single level over and over and fail too many times.\n\nThere is always a best way of being able to complete the puzzles in a certain number of moves. So you might get a puzzle and it reads par 6, meaning that this puzzle can be done in 6 moves at the best. But you can do the puzzle in more moves than that, you just won't obtain a star on that level to say that you have completed it in the shortest amount of moves.\n\nThe music to this game is really fitting to the sort of game that it is. You may find that the song gets repetitive, in which case there are 2 others that you can choose from or you can just turn it off completely if you so wish to. For me these 3 music tracks were decent enough for me to keep switching between them to keep me in the mood for this game.\n\nThe graphics of the game seem to fit the chess sort of feel to the game, being sort of older looking to the game. This makes the game look more appealing to me because of the consideration of the chess board and pieces looking less like you would expect modern ones to look like.\n\nPros+ Challenging yet fun gameplay\n+ 2 different modes\n+ 4 different difficulties on Endless Mode\n+ Nice power ups\n+ Lots of puzzle levels\n+ Nice music\n+ Steam Achievements & Trading Cards\n\nCons- Master difficulty on Endless is overkill\n- Sometimes puzzle levels can be a bit of a drag\n\nResult / Final ThoughtsGigachess is a fun yet challenging game, it balances these two elements well for the player to enjoy the game and not too challenging either. The two game modes seem to limit the game, but really there is a lot of replay value for the game, the music and graphics are both great and really suit the game.\n\nRating: 7.9/10\n\nThis review was submitted for Elite Giveaways, check us out for more reviews ranging from Indie games to AAA games.","May 21","true","5.1"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tartrazine/recommended/415910/","tartrazine","Tartrazine","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tartrazine/","1509 products in account","A quirky little puzzle game where you use your chess pieces (and power-ups - blockades, mines, and queen upgrades) to keep those filthy pawns from reaching your side of the board. You get to move each of your pieces once (but ONLY once) every turn, so that alone makes it better designed than Valkyria Chronicles!\n\nI do hope that the dev smoothes off some of the rough edges - the enemy animations are too fast ("Huh? What just happened?"), the tutorial's too curt (How about starting the first tutorial with a diagram showing how a pawn moves and attacks?), the two different enemy types look much too similar and it takes a few tries to remember that your piece that looks like a kendo guy is a bishop.\n\nBut unlike one of the other reviewers, I really like the music!","December 21, 2015","true","4.2"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","7","10","0","0"
