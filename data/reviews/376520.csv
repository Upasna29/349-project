Very complete for a game that is in Early Access. My only ask: PLEASE release this game with voice acting.","March 13","true","2.2"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","0"

The game takes neither itself nor the historical events it references terribly seriously, leading to a fun style and sense of humor reminiscent of some of the old classics.\n\nThe soundtrack is solid, and pairs well what's going on.\n\nIt's also surprisingly challenging, though I wouldn't call any of the puzzles unfair.  If you avoid walkthrough use, the back-and-forthing required to get past some of the puzzles will add up to a particularly long game.  But even if you peek a few times, the game is still quite substantial.\n\nAll in all, a solidly fun time!  My only real complaint would be that the lack of a hotspot finder doesn't do the game any favors, especially since a handful of the important hotspots hide in darkened corners.\n\nGo for it!","March 26","true","4.4"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","1"

The puzzles are chellenging but not unfair and it doesn't resort to any kind of bizzare game logic. Soundtrack is well-implimented and fits the game well. Still in early access so settings are thin on the ground and the story is still developing. I will enjoy returning to this at release.","March 27","true","0.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I finished this game in a couple of hours. The game was funny, the art was wonderful, but there were no voices, super easy puzzles, and the worlds were very small. I was expecting more. I still liked it, but I do not think it is worth the price. It could be something great if they continue to work on it though.","March 10","true","3.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

With this in my, I have had enough experience to understand what makes a good and bad point and click style game. Kelvin and the Infamous Machine may in fact be one of the BEST point and click adventure games in years. It's not very often that this genre of games is released into the market, with the other thought that it can be tricky to properly produce. Currently I have completed the first chapter and here are my thoughts thus far:\n\nPros:\nWonderful art, Great comedy, educational, engaging story, interesting characters with uniqueness, throws you right into the game like most well made point and click games, Fun sound effects, well thought out puzzles.\n\nCons:\nNo voice recordings of the characters speaking, which if properly executed can provide more of the emotion and comedy the game provides already.\n\nAbove all the game is wonderful and deserves a hat tip for the hard work put into it! I can't wait to finish the game!","March 20","true","1.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Notice I say "we" because Kelvin really doesn't have a clue but he isn't letting that get in the way! Kelvin's boss has gone around the bend and is changing history; Kelvin's job is to set things right again. With his trusty shower stall time machine, Kelvin sets off to set things aright.\n\nMy usual disclaimer here: I backed the game on Kickstarter so if that is too biased for you, I suggest you find another review or go visit your local public library.\n\nThe artwork in the game is bright clean and fun. The same can be said for the score. The tone is very lighthearted and g rated; this is a game for everyone to enjoy. If you are looking for historical accuracy, you won't find it here beyond the general events Kelvin is trying to save. The maps are not huge but there is enough ground to walk around and things to see to keep you interested. The game works with only the left mouse button so the interface is simple (there is a magnifying glass in your backpack (inventory) that allows you to examine items in detail). Most of the puzzles are surprisingly challenging given the lighthearted tone of the game. I admit to having had to fall back on the old adventure standard of "click everything in your inventory on evertyhing and everyone" a few times to progress! That said, there are clues given throughout the game and the puzzles are not unfair; just challenging.\n\nThe game is still in early release (version 0.8) so there are gaps. The voice work isn't in yet. However, if the voice work is on par with the artwork and the music it will be a huge plus for the game. The dialogue is in so the game is quite playable and there is the music to enjoy.  It appears that several puzzles are still in development so the final game might be longer to play. This version took an evening for each of the three chapters.\n\nIf you like adventures with just a bit of challenge, you will enjoy this game immensly. This is Blyt's first effort, let us hope there are more like this game in the future!","March 28","true","5.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The art is great and the game itself is really funny. The puzzles are interesting and not too hard or annoying.\nThe game is a bit short, but still worth it. I almost sort of wish it wouldn't end and just wait for another expansion for the story to continue in another time at a later stage.","April 4","true","12.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It has a lot of mind boggling puzzles that require you to think outside the box. I played this game with a friend and we solved the puzzles together. We beat the game in 5 hours and for what we got out of it I think it is fairly priced. Laughs from begining to finish and I can't wait until these guys finish the game. I absolutely love this game and would replay it again.\n\n\nIf you'd like to see some first hand game experience click the link. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Io5DR9WHdgk\n\nThey're also on KickStarter!!

The art is quite attractive, and well polished. It is not an educational game but the historical element may mean I might accidentally learn something. The style/writing feels very g-rated (even with the butt joke at the beginning) and aimed towards a younger audience but it still hits the mark for me.","March 21","true","5.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has lots of jokes, good music and cool characters. It would be nice to hear their voices in the next version :).\nMinus: I think it has too much hints in the conversations, like the choices have answers to something we have not discovered yet. It may be because it is an early acces... It made the game little short for me, because I was never stuck anywere for too long. Still enjoyed it!\n","June 5","true","7.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
