I got it when it was reduced by 98% to 0.21 EUR. After playing the first levels I feel about this is not really a creative new concept of bridge builder game.\n\nRather it's the same old overtaken principle of 'World of Goo': to build as less as possible triangles to reach a goal. The game proclaims to be very "challenging". But in the end you have the same problem like in 'World of Goo': There's only one perfect solution (OCD) to reach the 3 stars goal.\n\nWhy to repeat the old mistakes I wonder. Couldn't it be a funny, not so challenging physics bridge builder game? But apparently the overstimulated kids from today love to sit hours over simple graphics to find the adequate angle solution that their bridges bendover in the right moment. Sigh ! Where is the fun in this?\n\nAt least you have a hint option which refills for one hint / 10-15 min. Seems you have to "hint grind" through each level to unlock the "collect every star" achievement.\n\nPS. And the leaderboards are also pointless if you have just ppl doing "hint solutions".","October 5, 2015","false","5.2"," 59 of 73 people (81%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","81","59","73","4","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MartyrA2J/recommended/360380/","MartyrA2J","MartyrA2J","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MartyrA2J/","557 products in account","It's important to note that this review is based off the PC version of the game.\n\nSometimes an App needs to just stay out of the PC market, and stay as an App. This is the only thing I could think of during my time with Ratventure Challenge. The games genre is a simple one, build a bridge and get object A to point B. There are many of this type of these games in the genre, I haven't really played many of them. Names like Bridge Constructor, World of Goo, etc, jump to mind, just to name a few. The genre has never really garnered much interest in me, it always seemed rather repetitive. With Ratventure Challenge, I thought it would be a nice, interesting, way to break myself into the genre.\n\nFor the most part it does the job. The physics of the game can be a little strange and the game has some very odd design decisions, all of which we will be discussing here in this review. So lets start with something obvious. If you noticed at the top of this article, many prices are listed, ranging from five bucks to two bucks. Normally I don't list prices of the game on my blog, because I feel monetary value of a game is different from person to person. However in this case, I wanted to use them as a object point to a particular issue I have with this title. There is NO difference between the three versions of the game. Why is there a price difference? Simply for the pleasure of playing that game on that particular device? Now, I could ramble on about how this all seems shady but I will leave it at that for now.\n\nStraight from when you launch the game, Ratventure screams App. There isn't any retooling of options, buttons, or even the way you can interact with the screen. There are absolutely no graphics control or option menus present whatsoever. All you're left with is a sound off/on, music off/on button.\n\nThe game also is stuck in 1280/720 resolution, if you wanted to play it on full screen, there is no in-game way of doing this currently. For a PC port this is rather disappointing in most regards.\n\nNow let's get to the good stuff, the game play. Now if you were to ask me simply, is the game fun? I would say yes, ignoring all the other issues the game has a whole. The game is simple enough to play, with you building small pieces in a massive wooden structure, in hopes of getting some delicious cheese. The puzzles vary in difficulty and sometimes not in order. One level is ridiculously hard and then the next will be rather easy. I think this issue has to do with the fact that Ratventure doesn't really evolve all too much as a game. There are buzz-saws and rope hooks to change things up occasionally, but for the most part your building pieces never evolve or change.\n\nLevel designs are varied enough as you progress deeper into the games 72 levels and some of them can be quite the brain tickler. To help you along is a handy hint button that does a fairly good job of showing how to do it in the 3 star requirement. However, it doesn't let you do it step by step more then it shows it all at once and expects you to remember, this is probably done on purpose as it would be too easy otherwise. The game also features a useful "Undo last action button" that doesn't really work at all. The button only lets you undo the last action and sometimes not at all depending on what happens in the game. The game is full of these strange little inconveniences. As an example, if either of the rats die by some means, either falling or buzz-saw, you have to rebuild your entire structure over again, instead of just simply hitting the undo button.Why have this button at all?\n\nDesigning structures isn't too difficult. The game does respond quite rapidly to commands and the structure dynamically responds to the changes you make. If one side of the structure is built upon too much, it begins to sag or bend. If the rats jump on the structure, the structure responds to the sudden shift in weight. Keeping the aforementioned effects in mind, works rather well and lets you plan out your moves quite effectively. One thing that did annoy me quite a bit about the game though, was the fact that the rats won't go after the cheese even if it's in their faces. You have got to build the structure on top of the cheese and move them to it. The rats are stupid, and won't walk on grass.\n\nAesthetically speaking, Ratventure is just fine. The levels mostly change in color and the backdrop. Ratventure isn't certainly the most pretty of games but it isn't the ugliest as well, it gets the job done. I would have enjoyed a little bit of personality injected into the game. When the rats hit the buzz-saws they simply just fall off the screen. There could've been some added humor with them being ripped to bits or a funny sound effect. The game is just very monotone from beginning to end. Musically I felt the same about the game, while it never became grating on my ears, I never really noticed it or felt it was pleasant.\n\nThere is no story nor sense of personality to this game. You just hit the play button and that is simply it. No little cut scenes or images to explain anything. The game does offer a fair bit of replay value in chasing down the mystical 3 star achievement. There really isn't much of a reason to do this, no rewards or anything unlocked other then steam achievements, you just did it. Congratulations.\n\nSo you may be thinking I am coming off a bit harsh on this game? Keep in mind this was on the PC. I hold my PC games to a higher degree/standard and demand a bit more out of them. App games have the right to be simple on their platform, given the limitations of that platform. I would've probably been more than okay with all the issues and aspects to the game, had I played it on my phone or pad. However, the developer felt the need to make this PC port that is uninspiring and not very well done. Is the game fun? Yes. But is it worth it on PC? No. Get this game on your phone or pad, it's cheaper and you will probably enjoy it more as something to pass the time at the DMV.\n\nI only recommend this title, if its on sale, you really love bridge construction games, and know what you're getting. Otherwise buy it on your phone only!","June 19, 2015","true","1.0"," 53 of 67 people (79%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","79","53","67","4","6"

If you are familiar with physics-based bridge builders like World of Goo you should know what to expect. Six distinct worlds await, all containing 12 levels. Difficulty gradually increases either by giving you fewer blocks, asking for larger towers to be constructed or by placing more obstacles in your way.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2w_5j3iErA\nIt's a shame to have to down vote on the basis of in-game transactions link. Because the simulation itself is quite good, as are the controls. While not required to progress generally both steam users and valve frown upon such things and they really have no place in full priced pc games.  Other downside would be the lack of in-game options, Music had no volume slider so it was either on or off and couldn't run in full screen, was locked to a window @1280x768.\n\nPerhaps a little on the easy side I've not progressed far enough to make final judgement. With the in-game transactions removed and some video options added, I would give it the thumbsup as otherwise the price is about right and game is quite enjoyable. Cheers folks. :)\n\nEDIT:\nIn-game purchases were completely removed by request. While the game still lacks video options it's not worth completely overlooking if you enjoy playing with physics or puzzle games. Developer has also apologized for the over-reaction and community banning me for no reason, these things happen.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/reverendaspen/recommended/360380/","reverendaspen","Aspen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/reverendaspen/","176 products in account","What do you get when you take elements of Transformice, World of Goo, and Poly Bridge (all of which being far better than this), throw them in a blender, and hit liquify? What you should have is a big mess, and that's exactly what you get with Tiny Bridge: Ratventure.\n\nFirst off, this is quite obviously a mobile port. I was first suspicious from the startup resolution, which is locked at 1280x768. A 16:10 resolution, and a failry odd one at that. "Any options to change it or go fullscreen?" You're kidding right? The options are almost non-existent, with your only real options being turning the sounds and music on or off. Not up or down, on or off. There's also a button on the main menu that gives a bare-bones tutorial, but we'll get to gameplay in a bit.\n\nYour goal is to get your two mice to collect the glowing cheeses by making a bridge, and using as few pieces as possible to do it. One interesting thing I will give this game is that you're supposed to use your mice as counterweights to help balance the bridge in question. "Wait, aren't bridges supposed to be stable?" Nevermind that for now! But yes. Sounds cool, right? You get to not only guide your mice to their goal, but make them be PART of the puzzle? Indeed, it does… it SOUNDS cool. Then you play it. And where do I even begin with the gameplay?\n\nFirst, if you want a three-star, perfect level, there's literally only one way to do it: the way the hint button tell you to, and verbatum at that. If you deviate by any considerable margin or try to do it your own way, you won't get the perfect finish. Even if you collect all the optional cheeses and use less than half the parts given to you, you'll likely only get two stars, max. The hint button also makes the leaderboards moot, as everyone can just use the hints to achieve the perfect score (and many of the achievments if they have the patience).\n\nSpeaking of collection, there's a serious problem with hitboxes. Just look up screencaps of this game and you'll see that sometimes the mice will literally be touching the cheese but will refuse to collect it. "Just reach out and grab it, you lazy cusses! D=<" No, they have to be directly on top of it for it to count, and getting them to do that is a lot harder than it sounds.\n\nWhile on the subject of lazy mice, sometimes the tall thin one will refuse to move along with the short fat one, making me wonder if there's something wrong with me or if it's the game. Has anyone else had this problem, and if so, how do I fix it?\n\nThen there's the physics. Yeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh, they're not good, which is a real bad thing considering this is a bridge building game at heart. They're inconsistent, so much so that I've done the same thing several times in the same level and gotten different results. Tiny Bridge, you are not Bad Rats. Don't be like that.\n\nTo summarize, do you remember those three games I listed up at the top of the review? Play those instead. Yes, even Transformice.","October 6, 2015","false","2.6"," 28 of 35 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","28","35","2","0"

It has an attractive art style and a whimsical premise.  It is currently on sale and very cheap.\n\nCons:\nSadly, quite a few cons in this one.\n- First, it is obviously a mobile port.  There doesn't seem to have been much done in this conversion, including a lack of resolution options.  Sound and music are only toggles.\n- There is only one solution to three star a level, the solution that you can get by looking at the hints.  This takes away from any creativity that might have been part of the process.  Each level is simply a puzzle with one right solution.  That would be OK if not for....\n- Sometimes there are bugs.  The thin mouse sometimes gets lost and does not move.  Also, for a physics based game the underlying physics engine does not seem up to the task at times.  Sometimes, despite standing on top of your goal (the cheese), your mice seem unintersted in picking it up.  Maybe because you didn't follow the hint button map exactly.\n\n\nThe presentation isn't bad, and if you don't mind a simple puzzle game timewaster with a single solution you can get hints for, this is the game for you.

I enjoy a good puzzle game, but the physics are just too janky and the requirements are too precise. So it could have been a fun little game where you build a few different designs and there are a few options on each level, to get creative with. But each one has been built with a very specific solution on mind and because the wooden structures bounce around a lot with movement, sometimes even the exact same design will fail one time but work the next. So to finish the game with 3 stars becomes a grind or trial and error over and over. Anyhow I did it and I'm sure others will be able to as well, but I'd suggest that any other games in the series either tone down the bounciness of the structures or reduce the precision required to navigate the levels and let people come up with designs of their own to solve the problem.\nI'd say it was a thumbs sideways, but that's not an option, so call it a thumbs down in the hopes that people who want to play this understand that it's not as simple as the art style and gameplay trailer suggest.","November 20, 2015","false","24.5"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/2d_invasion/recommended/360380/","2d_invasion","RoX","http://steamcommunity.com/id/2d_invasion/","1244 products in account","Full Disclosure: Copy supplied by the developer for review.\nWhat happens when you take World of Goo and combine it with Bridge Builder?! Well, you get Tiny Bridge Ratventure. The basic premise of the game is to traverse 2 rats through a hostile terrain by building structures to collect cheese. The main principal of this physics basic bridge builder is nothing new as there are a lot of these type of games on the market but Ratventure does offer a few different mechanics that set it asside from the rest. Regardless of Ratventures small amount originalities, they still do not justify a $10.99 price point. My recommendation is only to buy it on sale (like $.21).\n\nLets look at the good (pro's), the bad (con's), and the ugly (straight-up "no no's").\n\nThe Good (Pro's) is that I am partial to these physics based bridge builder type games. The developer Estelion added player semi-controlled mechanics (opposed to automated as most bridge builder games are but movement is limited to points on the structure) making traversing the structure a little more difficult with hazards on the map. To add to the difficulty, they've added bonus cheese for extra points in addition to the level ending big cheese. The non-player controlled mechanics (I want to call these sprites "enemies" but they both help and hinder progress, so we will label them as "NPC's") have both positive and negative affects on your structure, sometimes making it bounce and sway, or adding stability to a structure. Building on to your structure while while its swaying all over the screen adds a challenge as well as a lot more teadium to the time it takes to build. Though you are limited to only building strut parts to your structure, in addition to the NPC's there are added variables for your bridge in the maps. These include ancor points and rope suspenders, both of which you have little to no placement control over.\n\nThe Bad (Con's) is that there are a lot of these games to choose from. Most of which at the same price point (not on sale) offer better graphics, better sound, more gameplay options or are just cheaper. Next, the only instruction for the game is pictures... Yes, there is not one word written for this game. Though it easy is to pick up, you still have to figure out how to play this game through the cryptic picture instructions given to you at the begining; and even then, there is no explanation of what everything does. Regardless, there is always trial and error or the community hub... Good luck there! I have not confirmed this but it is apparent with the game play that Ratventure is likely ported from either Andriod or iOS formats (couldn't find this one on the Google market) the bad part about it is that the games porting was never updated for the PC. This becomes more apparent with the instructions telling you to use your finger with the game mechanics. The Ugly (straight-up "no no's") part of the bad is that while the graphics are only okay, there are 6 worlds, each are just reskinned repeats of the last, and they never offer additional mechanics to differenciate it from it from the others. The first bit of ugliness most will notice is the lack of menu options. The only options that are available are play, a link to the dev's website, instructions (or lack there-of), and mute - which is not a bad thing as both the sound and music are absolutely horendous. Make sure you have a decent playlist ready before you start playing. Lastly with the options (again... or lack there-of), there is no full screen (...or any other graphic options for that matter), no control options, not even an exit... wow. Estelion developers please note this article on The Ten Commandments of Video Game Menu's.\n\nOverviewGameplay: Physics based Logic Builder\nGraphics: Lacking but otherwise okay.\nSound: OMG! MAKE IT STOP!\nControls: Better on a touch screen. Mouse controls for everyone else.\nReplayability: Though I have yet to figure out how to get anything more than one star on a level, the challenge for more stars is offered. I'd think most people will never play a level again once it has been passed.\nOverall: Good for a couple hours and is a fun game if you are into the gameplay, otherwise it may not be worth your time and money.\nThe verdict for gamers is to avoid it if your not into the gameplay and buy it on sale!","October 5, 2015","true","1.0"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

It's difficult to point out what exactly is wrong - the music is killing my nerves, the lack of multistep undo punishes experimentation, and the balancing methods are questionable at the very least, but I feel I'm only scratching the surface with these. However, I stopped after 2-3, and that's probably telling more.

The one thing I have to say that makes me not recommend this game is the insane price for such a small, short and simple game. 12$ is incrediby overprice for a game worst maybe 5$.

But as I said, just in my opinion). The idea itself it's good and could be entertaining, however I don't really recommend this game unless you have the greatest patience in the world. I tried a few levels and I just gave up. In the third level, for example, I did the bridge exactly as the "idea" said, however the rats didn't move in the same way so I had to redo it a few times till finally the rats moved just like on the example. It is too restricted, it should be a little more liberal... Does it really matter how to do the bridge as long as the rats can get their cheese?","May 2","false","0.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I didn't have high expectations but I was still left feeling really disappointed with it.\n\nThe biggest problem I had with it is the physics, given that it's a physics game it's a real issue for the game when the main aspect of the game just fails.\nIt feels a bit too "bouncy", like the wood is made out of rubber, no matter how much support you add, all your structure/bridge wants to do is wobble, flail around and isn't able to stay firmly in  one place.\nYou can copy a hint, 100% to how it's shown and still not be able to do the level..In most cases the hint shown is the only solution to solve the level. Little creativity can be done; making it really dull.\n\nI think the biggest frustration I had with the game and made me abandon it was that if you did a test run and then ended it the contraption doesn't 'pause', it still keeps the same momentum it had before leaving it to break even in construction mode.\nAs it's still able to move during this phase it leaves it being a pain in the ♥♥♥ to build, you can fail before you even start testing it. It's irritating and a buggy mess.\n\nThere's so many bridge construction games out there which are much better off than this, it had a nice idea but the game is just poorly made.\n\nNot worth buying it but you can get it for nothing when it gets a high discount, the bundle it's included in has some nice games though but don't expect any enjoyment from Tiny Bridge: Ratventure.","May 22","false","2.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It's about a couple of rats who want an unlimited amount of cheese, and that's what they do for the entire game.\n\nGRAPHICSThe characters and background don't look bad or anything, but the repetitive levels and poor animations show the game's nature as mobile game port.\n\nGAMEPLAYYour goal is to reach the big piece of cheese at the other end of the level, while trying to use less pieces of wood for your bridge as possible, as well as collecting as many pieces of cheese as possible to get an higher score at the end of level. Either I am really bad at this game, or there is something wrong with the physics. Most of the time, you will feel really frustrated by the unintuitive gameplay. There is a hint system which tells you exactly what to do to beat a level, but having to alternate between constructing and moving the rats doesn't make things easier and show that not much love was put into the port.\n\nCHALLENGEThe game doesn't feel challenging, but frustrating. The physics are illogical, the level design is not all that great and there is no learning curve: you'll find yourself going from an easy level to an hard one to an easy one again in a matter of seconds.\n\nSOUNDRepetitive music? Check. Poor amount of sound effects? Double check. Music not playing randomly? TRIPLE CHECK.\n\nREPLAYABILITYOther than trying to get an high-score in each of the 72 levels, there aren't secrets or unlockables that will make you come back to this game.\n\nThis game is not for me, mostly because of its obvious nature as an iOS port and the terrible physics. The game is relatively cheap, and if you like this genre then you will love this and have a good time. Otherwise, you would be wasting money.\n\nStory: n/a\nGraphics: 6\nGameplay: 4.5\nChallenge: 5.5\nSound: 3.5\nReplayability: 5\n\nENJOYMENT: 4.5\nFRUSTRATION: 8\nFollow me on Twitter: @nickygra97\nSubscribe to my channel\nLike on Facebook\n{LINK REMOVED}Check my official website\nJoin my Steam group","May 10, 2015","false","3.4"," 12 of 32 people (38%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","38","12","32","2","0"

I was wrong. This game is no way fun like World of Goo, this game is more like frustrating. First when I launched the game I saw it's in windowed mode so I tried going fullscreen with Alt + Enter because I didn't find any settings about this game and that didn't work I spend a few minutes trying to figure it out until I decided to check the Community Hub for this game and come to find out this game doesn't have Full screen mode at all which is frustrating. Then I jump into the game and the mechanics are broken sometimes, like one of the mice will fail to move, sometimes the mice will ignore the cheese completely and sometimes the bridges won't place like you want them. You will end up getting one stars and two stars and not realising what you have to do or why you did get or did not get three stars. Also another thing is that the undo function is broken. Maybe I was hyped too much and it effected my opinion on the game for expecting a game like World of Goo or maybe that's not the case at all and that the game is not good but simply I don't like this game and all it did is get me frustrated at it so I cannot recommend it.","November 1, 2015","false","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is a puzzle game that has been done before, but usually, the units (lemmings, monkeys, etc.) move on their own logic toward the exit, rather than you controlling it. The idea is to use minimum number of moves and minimum number of segments to build the structure. This is obviously a mobile game port, as the structure is identical to many similar action-puzzle games, including the long-lived Angry Birds franchise, where you have multiple "stages", each stage containing a dozen or more levels and you can get up to 3 stars per level. The more stars, the more levels are unlocked. There's not much else to the game though. The trick is in how complicated structure you have to build and how to minimize the steps you have to take to grab all the cheese. As the cheese are further apart and terrain gets trickier, the structures you build start to take on Rube Goldberg machine properties even though they aren't supposed to move... much.\n\nIf you want a bridge-building game, there are better ones. This is a puzzle game similar to Worlds of Goo where you build structures to reach stuff. It's really nothing special.","November 7, 2015","false","9.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

All but the earliest levels will rely on your bridge bending, breaking, or falling off a cliff to solve the puzzle. It's a neat idea, but between the interface, the sound design and the infuriating piece placement I can't bring myself to reccomend it. It all becomes a chore far too quickly.\n\nSteam really needs a "meh" review option, but in lieu of than it's getting a thumbs down.","March 6","false","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It was alright for the first 5 - 10 levels, but then it became dull and boring for me. However, this is just my personal preference.\n\n\nPros:\n- Game is rather simple.\n- The physics are okay.\n\nCons:\n- Redundant gameplay. Feels like you are playing the same levels over and over.\n- "Building" the bridge is VERY limited to what you can do.\n- Game play overall feels a lot like Angry Birds; try and get 3 stars on every level to unlock more levels.\n- The background music doesn't really help the "fun" factor. It's cute, but hearing the same thing loop over and over gets old fast.\n\n\nAgain, everyone has their own opinion. This is just mine.","January 27","false","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
