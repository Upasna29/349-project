I will provide a TL;DR at the end.\n\nGameplay\nCurrently there are 14 (15 if you include level 0) levels to play through. The first few levels could be seen as tutorials to show you the different features and ways to beat puzzles within the game. Everything within Colortone is linked with using colors, whether it be to finish the level, destroy a wall, or to make a platform. There are 6 colors within Colortone which are the 3 primary colors (blue, red, and yellow) and the 3 secondary colors (purple, orange, and green). There are 2 types of object you can color according to which dab of colour you put it in, a small sphere and a board. You can dip these in individual colors or you can dip in one, then another, to create a secondary color. The game uses an interesting platforming idea where you place your boards on certain colored rods and if the board matches the colored rod then it have created a platform for you to jump on. There are also machines which use the sphere colored with primary colors to create its secondary colors (Example: blue would create green and purple), secondary colors create their individual primary colors (Example: green would create blue and yellow), and a machine which will take the color of the sphere and put it down so you can use it (Example blue means you get blue). There are certainly a lot of good puzzle elements which can be utilized within Colortone to make sure it is a very pleasant experience.\n\nGraphics/Sound\nColortone has an amazing soundtrack that is able to easily ease you into a calm mood to play through and enjoy the game. The graphics are fairly basic, nothing that stand out that much. The game will be mostly white except for the colors seen in walls, platforms, spheres, machines, light beam, and everything you can use/have to go through to beat the level and lava.\n\nPros/Cons\nPros\n\n+ Good concept\n+ Great use of color within puzzles to solve them\n+ Good soundtrack\n+ Fun gameplay\n+ Options for colorblind to allow for them to enjoy this game\n\nCons\n\n- Very limited replay value (only 15 levels)\n- Beatable within 2 hours\n- Some levels have a slight problem where if you die with an object and lose it, you are unable to obtain it and have to restart\n- Unable to run on Windows 10 (at the moment)\n\nSuggestions\nThese are my personal suggestions to the game that I feel will change the game for the better.\n\n- An in-game editor to allow players to create their own levels along with a sharing feature to play other people's maps\n- More campaign maps\n\nFinal Thoughts\nI was able to enjoy almost all of my time spent within Colortone, but I was disappointed to find out that there were only 15 levels with nothing else. This game would be drastically improved if it had an editor with the map to create custom maps.\n\nTL;DR\nColortone is a very interesting and fun to play puzzle game that utilizes colors. The game is currently around 2 hours to beat with only 15 levels. The soundtrack does a nice job in immersing you into the game and makes for a more relaxing experience. If you like the look of the game and have the $5 lying around you might consider purchasing this for yourself as it's a good experience with everything that is within the game so far.\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","December 5, 2015","true","3.0"," 31 of 35 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","31","35","2","7"

So if that's the make or break point for you, wait for now.\n\nPretty fun little first person puzzle game, kind of an Antichamber-lite. You carry items, color them on sort of inkpads (often multiple times), and then use them to get through a variety of color themed puzzles to escape the level. Fairly short; I'm about 75% through in 1.4 hours. I got it as part of a greenlight bundle for cheap. Not sure at what price point I'd recommend it (and get Antichamber first!), but it was worth what I have in it at least.","February 4","true","1.4"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","1"

The game has some nice things and some pretty bad ones, but in general I think the game has potential.\n\nThe nice/good things. It's a puzzler game, though not the harsest one out there. Fun thing is that it uses colors (duhuh ^^) you have to mix to progress through the puzzles. Sadly though, aside from the colors you need to paint your balls, planks and whatever will come later on, the game is all in white :(\n\nThe bad - CONTROLS. Seriously, click RMB to pick up and LMB to drop? Why not keep either button constantly pressed to have it picked up and release to drop the item?\nThe items you need for the puzzles get stuck a lot! You can use the mouse scrollwheel to change the item's distance from you, but still, they get stuck a lot. And when they've been stuck they're out of sync from your mouse pointer :(\n\nIn general it's an "I've had better" kind of game. Enjoyable for when I want to play some easier puzzle ;-)","July 8, 2015","true","0.2"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","15","19","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Californ1a/recommended/375320/","Californ1a","Californ1a","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Californ1a/","836 products in account","General InfoI originally picked this up when I heard about it during the Co-Optional Podcast's releases section when TB mentioned it looked Antichamber-esk. With me being one of the few people who have hundreds of hours in Antichamber (speedrunning/routing), it looked like an obvious game to pick up, and upon buying it (during it's early access period), noticed it had a "Speedrun" mode button on the main menu, which appealed to me. At the time, it wasn't a functional mode, and was just a placeholder button. I livestreamed my first play of the early access version, and promptly posted here on the community discussions what my thoughts were (along with some bugs).\n\nDeveloperThe dev is very nice and responsive in the community discussions, however this is where the game starts to get a few demerits from me. I realize making a game can be time consuming, and plenty of other things can be much more important, but the dev had specifically assigned dates for each new level to come out. This schedule worked fine for the majority of the levels, however near the last few levels, the dev missed releasing about 3 or 4 levels in a row, constituting about 2 months of no updates, with no word from the dev about when updates would come. The only information was via this thread on the community discussions. The dev also does not maintain any active news/announcements posts or changelogs so when the game does update, you have no idea what has changed, and you can't look back at any "previous" changelogs because none exist.\n\nScheduleMid-August was meant to be the release for the first level that was skipped, and as seen in the thread linked above, the dev said that all the final levels as well as speedrun mode would be finished by the end of September. Nearing the end of October is when the update finally arrived, without speedrun mode, and with two broken levels. The bugged levels were promptly fixed, as I have already said the dev is responsive on the community discussions.\n\nBugsSure there are bugs, but nothing too major. Any major bugs I've seen (and posted about) have been promptly fixed by the dev. Again, as I said above, the dev is quite responsive for this kind of stuff. The only main bugs I can think of currently are that some objects can get stuck inside walls/floor, but it can be looked at as a quirk of the game and just takes some getting used to how to control yourself when carrying an object. I've found that the controls themselves are fine for my tates, as opposed to what some of the other reviews say about the right/left mouse functions, just takes some getting used to.\n\nSpeedrun ModeThere is no information regarding speedrun mode at the time of posting this, and last I checked, the button in the main menu has been removed, and the game has come out of early access, so I feel as though the dev has dropped the idea completely.\n\nConclusion$5 is pretty cheap, so I would recommend it, and the game itself as-is right now is still pretty great for that price, however I do feel like there are a lot of things the dev could have done better during the early access time period, such as posting changelogs (or even having version numbers to begin with), or news posts about any delays or changes of ideas/direction.","November 25, 2015","true","3.8"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","1"

Not to mention the idea was already used in Q.U.B.E and the whole graphical design on Antichamber.\n\nThe optimization is all over the floor, from the lowest to the highest settings, it stutters when you're moving. You can see the stutter on the gameplay video here too. I could only stand 4 levels because of a certain bug (the platform was stuck on the wall and I couldn't get it out, it was flickering and I had to restart the whole level)\n\nI certainly don't recommend this unpolished Unity garbage, my library is already full of those.

This is problematic as some longer levels make you start over from the beginning.\n- Minor glitches; Some objects won't respawn if they fall into a pit of lava, for one. There was also an unusual glitch where a board I was carrying suddenly doubled in length. Like... what?\n- Too short: Colortone can be completed in fewer than 2 hours, even less if you know what you're doing.\n\nOverall Colortone is a fun little game, and a nice time-killer when you want to wind down from more intense games.","November 28, 2015","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
