Each turn, you choose an action for each crew member, you can: create a room in the base or craft something (weapon, armor), or help a character with low stats  to stay alive, giving him (her) food, heat or health in the appropriate room, or pick a mission and send one or more characters outside to find resources (there are also other types of missions). During a mission, the characters explore a map and fight enemies in turn-based combat. It's cold, so they can't stay outside for too long.\n\nYou have to manage the characters and the scarce resources, with the lurking menace of a base invasion that will happen in a determined number of turns. There are various strategies to try and things to learn, with rooms that can be upgraded and the characters who gain useful skills with experience. I like the retro pixel graphics. The interface reminds in some aspects a board game:  in the base, to do an action, you slide a character token on a room and then make a choice in a menu. I appreciate this style and all works well so far. The tutorial teaches well the basics. In normal mode, you pick three goals (with various difficulty levels) and you succeed when you reach them. A successful run gives points to unlock more characters. So far, I played a few runs and I reached the easier goals. I will play more.\n","March 31","true","20.4"," 33 of 39 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","33","39","0","1"

Plays in tiny window and when scaling to full screen you have issues with mouse sensitivity. When it's fixed, it may become a nice game for a day or two.\n\nBase building mechanics - each turn you assign people to build new facilities and sustain life, heal etc.\n\nTactics part - it's a simple TBS where you use explore map and use some abilities, and basically it's a risk assessment game as you may end up losing all your crew on an easy scavenging mission. Plays way too slow, it's not cool to go all the way back to starting square.","May 6","false","9.1"," 21 of 26 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","21","26","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JustinSane059/recommended/454030/","JustinSane059","Dr. JustinSane","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JustinSane059/","1795 products in account","This review is a part of Steamified's Community Reviews project and the credit goes to both Steamified and Brainwashing Games for providing the key for reviewing purposes.\nLink is a strategy roguelike game developed by Brainwashing Games that has just come out of a relatively short period of Early Access. It combines a great roguelike combat system and interesting base management gameplay where resource management is vital to ensure the survival of your crew.\n\nThe story starts off with your ship having malfunctioned and crashlanded to a snow-clad and hostile planet. Help is on it's way but with no nearby ship to evacuate the crew, the survivors will have to survive the hostile environment and the aggressive Xenos until help finally arrives.\n\nThe gameplay consists of basically two main parts, one is the base building and resource management phase and the other revolves around exploration and doing missions outside. First I will talk about the base building component. I just have to say that it's a good surprise to have this in a roguelike game as it changes how you would normally thrive in the other games in the same genre. The mechanic is a la the XCOM series where you build different components on each room at the cost of valuable resources. These rooms can be further upgraded to increase it's functionality, provided that you've amassed enough of the required resources. There is also a "Doomsday" meter (not sure what it's called exactly) that fills up slowly as each day passes by. Once it reaches 100, the local Xenos will initiate base invasion (I got a Game Over because of this since there's no chance for me to survive when I'm down to two crew member).\n\nThe resources I've mentioned consists of Food (for obvious reasons), Knowledge (required to build and craft advance components), Fuel (To heat up) and Tools (for building and crafting), Resources are scarce and vital for both maintenance of the crew and to build rooms.\n\nThe other part of the game consists of doing exploratory missions out of your crashed space ship either to salvage, to rescue other survivors (added to your crew if you're successful) or bounty hunting to lower the threat meter. The combat revolves around careful management of Stamina. In battle you can either choose to spend all of it to rush and kill the enemy in one swoop at the cost of slow regeneration afterwards, or take it slow and steady and ensure your crew have ample amount of stamina in case things go south. Of course, this is an arctic planet so the longer you're outside, the faster you'll lose your heat. Once it gets down to zero and your men will go down one by one. The best course of action is to get out, get what you need, get back ASAP.\n\nNow that's all covered, I'm gonna mentioned the pros and cons of this game and hopefully it'll explain why I gave Link a thumbs down.\n\nPROS\nBlends brilliant resource management and roguelike elements in a game. It adds a new level of tension when it comes to your crew survival.\nThe combat system is deep and highly rewarding once you've get the hang of it. The stamina system works wonderfully and it definitely stands out from the others.\nHigh amount of replayability. Before the start of each new game, you will be presented with a choice of goals that you would like to achieve during your run. For example, Survive 5 Turns, Kill 10 Enemies, Discover an Artifact, etc. Fulfill the initial goal and you will be rewarded Requisition points where you can use it to unlock different crews and their accompanying bonuses.\nBase building is fun! A welcome change of pace compared to the other roguelikes.\nDevs are active in the forum, answering questions and getting bug reports.\nNEUTRAL\nThis game has a pretty steep difficulty curve, even at the early stages. Waste too much resources and you'll be dead in no time. I just wish they would implement varying difficulty settings to encourage newbies to get accustomed to the game's mechanic.\nCONS\nThey say first impressions are a powerful thing and unfortunately, this game doesn't leave a good one for me.\n\nThe biggest thing that got me is that the game doesn't support native widescreen support, or any other resolutions to boot! The default window is a small, I guess, around 800x600? Playing on a 32" inch TV, it's a chore to bring my head forward just to read what the description is saying. There's a fullscreen toggle available in the game but, first, it doesn't state that anywhere in the game. I have to check out the Discussion section to see what it is (it's Alt + Enter, btw). Secondly, the Fullscreen mode is basically just a stretch of the small window and the result is unbearably ugly and not to mention the side borders getting cropped. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy pixels aesthetic but this is just bad.\nThe Settings page is bare with only sliders to sounds available. No Fullscreen, no key configurations, no nothing.\nLack of any basic Steam functionality. There's no Overlay, no screenshots, no achievements, etc. The only thing available right now are the trading cards but I don't think they're released yet. Probably in the next couple of weeks or so. It's available now. My Badge page must be bugged before.\nKeys are not remappable, nor are they shown to the player. As I've stated before, I wouldn't have known about the Fullscreen mode unless I checked out the Discussion and pressing F12 (to take a screenshot) immediately brings me back to the title screen!\nThe game crashed on me once during the tutorial and according to the other complaints, I'm guessing there will be a lot more to come.. Fortunately some of these are already acknowledged by the devs and I hope it will be fixed in future updates.\nMinor typos here and there.\nTo conclude, I give Link an average 3/5. A wonderful game at it's core but greatly severed by the lack of the essentials in a PC game.\nI have high hopes for the game, and the devs seem committed too. I'm gonna wait until a few more updates and patches to roll in and I'll gladly jump into the game again and adjust my review accordingly. I'm confident that once the rough edges are smoothed out, Link will definitely be a contender for a hidden gem title. For now, I simply cannot recommend this unless roguelike and strategy games are your cup of tea, then by all means, go for it. For $5 you can't go wrong.\n\n\nFor similar Steamified Reviews and Giveaways, please visit http://www.steamified.com/.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LordCharidarn/recommended/454030/","LordCharidarn","Lord Charidarn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LordCharidarn/","399 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nFrom playing the Tutorial and one playthrough:\n\nLink is a fairly challenging turn-based strategy game. Balancing risk and reward, the game keeps you on a knife's edge. Do you send your tired survivors out to look for food, or rest them up, but risk starvation? Do you spend time sitting in the library gathering research points, or spend precious materials to build a pistol? Do you try for that last cache of supplies on the map, risking frostbite?\n\nEach character in your crew can be used for one action a day. These vary from building new rooms or clearing away supplies, to crafting new tools or exploring outside of the ruined ship. Exploration outside moves you to a combat map were you explore for supplies and either evade or confront the native people who are intent on overwhelming your party. Characters gain experience and learn new skills, so losing a crew member is always a fearful possibility.\n\nThe game graphics are mainly static backgrounds and tokens that you drag across the screen. It plays much like a boardgame, and has some depth too the decisions you make. Fairly enjoyable experience for the cost, and the replayability is decent: successfully accomplishing your objectives (which you get to pick at the start of the game), gives you requisition points to unlock new crew members to start new games with.","April 11","true","2.4"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","15","18","0","0"

Link plays very much like a board game that varies based on 3 victory rules that you choose before starting a new game. Victory rules might include:\n\n-Killing a ringleader\n-Surving 15 rounds\n-Caching 20 units of fuel\netc.\n\nThis adds a lot of variability to the game once you understand the core mechanics as your strategy to achieving all of the three victory rules (and ensure rescue) will determine your strategy.\n\nEvery game is a race against the clock. With each passing round your survivors will lose energy and heat and the increase threat of a base attack means that will have to be proactive with your strategy from the get-go. Do you hunker down, reasearch weapon tech and arm your survivors for a full on base attack? Or do you brave the surface of the alien planet to hunt down the native inhabitants in order to put off the inevitabilty of an invasion for a few more rounds?\n\nThis is an early access game and as such still has many bugs and glitches that crop up from time to time. For the most part it has not been too devastating or game breaking. Further, this game is very very difficult for the first five or ten rounds until you start to become more efficient with your round managament. In about 15 games I may win 4 or 5, depending on victory rules of course.\n\nFurther, won games grant you requistion points used to buy heros that have their own special abilities that bring a further layer of variability to your initial strategy. Heros may be robotics experts, commandos, leaders, rangers or mechanics- all with a unqiue skill set to offer.\n\nThere are many other features included like rescue missions, resource scavenging, reasearch and technology etc- more than I am willing to list for the sake of this mere thumbs up.\n\nAll in all I reccomend Link. It is a relaxing, albeit challenging little game with lots of replayability for the price.\n","April 15","true","25.2"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","14","17","0","0"

Well, here I go...\n\nI sort of feel sorry for the dev here as I've read a comment of his where he stated that a change in graphics/resolution would require a whole re-write of the game engine. Well, he'd better get started on that re-write because without a change in the tiny resolution, sprites and UI he is simply wasting his time putting any more effort into this game: it won't sell. Graphics generally are not that important to me, but this looks like something that should be played on an Amiga 500 in 1994 with the old Philips Monitor, not a modern PC, where 1080p monitors are the norm...but perhaps the dev is actually coding this on an Amiga 500 with the old Philips monitor in 1994!\n\nIn any case, the premise of the game is cool and I was digging the base building bit, which is reminiscent of the original UFO: Enemy Unknown base building mechanic: You build improvements in each square to provide resources for your guys etc...\n\nThe tactical part of it is pretty ropey with zero difficulty curve. Perhaps I need to send all my guys out on the first mission? Generally, I just send one as it's the first mission, simply a scavenging hunt and that should be a breeze, right? Wrong. My soldier dude is no match for two little spiders, he can't kill a frickin' baby deer and he gets cold, weak and downright lazy after about 2 turns. Also, there seems to be no escape except to fight once an enemy is on the same square as your little dude. Not very tactical, is it?\n\nI want to like this game as I think there are some interesting ideas but it just comes off as too amateurish to warrant any more attention from me.\n\nDear Dev, get a free version of Unity and realise your ambition for this game. There is definitely a good game in here and I'm sure there is a market for it, but it needs to have proper resolution scaling and some game balance.","May 13","false","3.2"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"
