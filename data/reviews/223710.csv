"http://steamcommunity.com/id/InnerConflict/recommended/223710/","InnerConflict","InnerConflict","http://steamcommunity.com/id/InnerConflict/","291 products in account","Cry of Fear is a Psychological First Person Shooter Survival Horror game taking place in Stockholm (Fäversholm ingame), Sweden.\n\nCry of Fear is my 2nd favorite game of all time. It only gets beaten by S.T.A.L.K.E.R. I love Cry of Fear so much because of the atmosphere, the sick and twisted horror or it might be because, and I can assure you that,  it is one of the best survival horror games I ever played for not being triple A. The atmosphere is one of the best ever accomplished in a video game as well. Only Silent Hill and Condemned or Amnesia being much higher on the ranking, or eteneral darkness, but what makes this games environment stand out is the brutal emptiness of the swedish city nightsky, the lonliness, the monsters and the madness playing around simon, the protagonist. It´s depressing, oppressing, evil and obscure, something very unique even if nothing compared to condemned, suffering, etc... the great masterpieces of survival and horror. The story is simple but good even if the execution is sloppy and cringeworthy. Simon acts really naive and childish sometimes but grows with further developement of the story, establishing a good connection between the player and Simon. Depressed, full of emotional problems and self suppression, having problems of confessing his feelings for his crush, Simon is getting into an car accident, which changes his life forever. If you could throw ♥♥♥♥ at someone, everyone would throw it at Simon. I don´t want to spoil to much here so I simply want to say that this games story is mainly about suicidal, homicidal thoughts, depression, anxiety and some really dark psycho horror. It talks to people with mental issues, as well as it does show mentally sane people at least the realism inside the surrealism of being a ♥♥♥♥ed up individual. As you can see, a topic not everyone likes, that´s why not everyone really liked playing the game for its story, or because the story was not speaking to some/most of the players, or they disliked the gameplay which is a taste on its own. For more look at the gameplay section of this review.\nNot everyone like me or maybe you went through the same situations and thoughts as Simon. I can feel for him with all of my heart though. Give it a try and see for yourself. Make sure to be open enough for these topics though. You really have to try it out and give it a chance. It´s based on the GoldSrc engine on which also Half Life 1 was running on. Team Psykskallar really made the best out of this old engine and you can clearly see it. Graphics are decent for what they can provide.\n\n\nHorror, Gameplay, Puzzles, etc.:\n\nYou have a big variety of levels, from the typical subway station to the mental hospital and forest but also parks and sewers, subway maintenace bays, construction sites and apartements, a school, a very nice boat scene and more!\nYou have an inventory system like resident evil. You have to carefully pick and manage your equipment. It´s kept more simple though. Weapon models are excellent, as are their animations and the sound design overall. Close Combat is clunky at the beginning but gets better and very smooth and satisfying after some time, as you figure out that GoldSrc is not good with melee weapons and thus the modder Andreas Rönnberg thought that a Dodge Button or double tap S or W, A or D could be quite useful and you start to adapt. Most people still don´t know that, you can even disable it in the options completely. Some people though will never learn it or like it. It really is just improvised and clunky due to the problems that old engine puts up. Do not worry Mr.Shooter, usually after the apartements, as soon as you get your first gun, that should be after 40 mins, you change the playstyle anyway. From 100% melee to what ever percentage of combatstyles, due to ammo count, you want. You have to create your own technique of slash and dodge to succesfully kill your opponent when once run out of ammo due to ammo scarcity. Dodging is purely accomplished by exercising it. Ammo for guns can be scarce on normal and hard, not so much on easy.\nNow to the horror. If you played Amnesia or Slender and you felt it was a walk in the park, then this game is nothing for you. It´s between Resident Evil with a touch Silent Hill. It has some cheap jumpscares, good jumpscares, many jumpscares, either unpredictable or very predictable, depending on your experience with game design, level design, and games, especially horror games in general. If you fall into the horrorspiral and you start being scared by this game and a nice haunting paranoia scrawls up your skin, it seems like this game achieved what it wanted to achieve. The Paranoia and meaninglessness of the world in general will hit you. This game is pure shizophrenia and depression in one pill to go.\nThe soundtrack is one of the best in video games history, fitting perfectly to the games environment, characters emotional state and just the mood of the game, making it effective to build tension and depressiong feelings in the right moments. If you are a very emotional or sensitive person, you will love it. If you are a cold brick, better go back and play your casual games or tougher horror games with VR because CoF is really just a nice spooky ride and not a house of horror wanting you to ♥♥♥♥ your pants. Those games are horror focused as with this game it uses horror as its style.\nSome "Puzzles"/Riddles can be frustrating and many parts can be hard to accomplish or are just pure adrenaline kicks (maze). As the maze is easy and requires the typical smart gamer skillset of good memory it can come over as if the game is badly designed or unbalanced. Yes, you have no map... why would you, the maps in this game aren´t that big anyway. Use your brain or go back to elementary school. First time playing it, its hard, but after you solved them, it´s really satisfying and rewarding and you can simply facepalm yourself for your own stupidity. I did at the fuse backtracking. The overall feeling after finishing the game is fantastic. It makes you feel accomplishment. And don´t call Simon an Emo or I come and eat your eyeballs.\n\n\nEndings & Game Length:\n\nThere are different endings and choices to be made, if I remember correctly, you have two choices which give you 4 main story endings. 1 co-op ending, 1 secret and 1 manhunt campaign ending.\nThe game is about 10 hrs for beginners and 8 for faster people and can be beaten in sub 2,5 hrs by pros or challenge hunters.\n\n\nConclusion:\n\nFor me it´s a 10/10. A fair unbiased rating would be a 7/10.\nIt has its problems but how I like to say: Somebody who can´t be patient and endure a few grinding moments, also can´t enjoy the joy of accomplishment and nostalgia.\n\n\nTechnical Issues & Contacting Me:\n\nIf you have technical issues, please go to the CoF Forums, contact me or ask other CoF players for help. We always want to help as much as we possibly can. ^^ This game is heavily modified,  to such a degree, it´s just obvious that it´s having many technical bugs and problems on older or unstable systems. Sometimes it´s a graphical setting and sometimes just the steam client forgetting to download a file, so checking the game files often helps.\n\nPlease don´t send friend invites just for wanting to play with me. You can add me anyways but keep in mind I won´t play it with you. ^^ I played the game long enough since its 2012 release. ^^ I got the whole cake already. On the forum you can ask others though. I´ve beaten every possible story and the co-op easily 5 to 8 times, gimme a break please :/\n\nOfficial Forum and Technical Support[www.cry-of-fear.com]\n\nFun Fact: I think I noticed something. Don´t the trash bins in the game look hella lot like the official Team Psykskallar logo? :]","November 25, 2013","true","79.1"," 744 of 816 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","744","816","0","5"

It isn't one of your average cheesey horror games. Cry of fear is a game where you never know what to expect around the corner.  It could be a chainsaw maniac that wants to chop off your head or a mental deranged child wanting to kill you.  Even though sometimes the enemies get repeated in some sections there are always fresh jumpscares that make up for it.\n\nThe Good/The Bad\n\nGood\nScary unlike other horror games\nUnpredictable\nThe game is around 8 hours long (plenty of jumpscares!)\nIt's got co-op so you can crap yourself with your friends\nFree!\nBad\nOutdated graphics\nSometimes buggy (not often, very rare)\nSome sections of the game are unforgiving (lots of enemies, not much ammo)\nCo-op sometimes doesn't work (very good when it does)\n\nVerdict\n\nSounds 8/10\nGraphics 5/10 (uses half life 1 engine)\nGameplay 8/10\nAtmosphere 10/10\n\nOverall Score\n9/10\n"Fantastic, Frightening\nand Free"\n\nCry of Fear is a highly recomended game for anyone who likes a truly scary game and a bit of a challenge as well.

Woot Woot!\n\nWhat you'll love...\n- The Story... It's really Enjoyable and Depressing (hey, it's a horror game) at the same time!\n- The Gameplay... Excluding the confusing inventory, the gameplay is awesome! Survival Horror at it's best!\n- The Soundtrack... One word: BEATIFUL! If you can, buy it! Support the devs and listen to this relaxing/scary/awesome soundtrack! (actually, there are 2 soundtracks!)\n- The Co-Op... Yeah, i guess it's broken and you need to port forward or use Hamatchi, but when you actually get to play it, it's AWESOME!\n- The Visuals... It's using a 1998's engine, but looks good by today's standards too! Psykskallar milked everything out of the GoldSource engine!\n\nWhat you'll hate...\n- Some Cheap Jumpscares only scary once or twice...\n- Some low res Textures and graphical bugs (you won't notice them if you aren't trying to find them on purpose, hopefully)\n- Difficulty curves, ya know... bosses and Sawrunner...\n- Forgetting not to waste ammo (you lose unspent bullets if you reload with a non-empty magazine*)\n- And of course... having to wash your underwear after playing this amazing Survival Horror game which will not only require you to change underwear, but sleep with the lights on for the next few days!\n\n- Skandi007 Survival Horror Veteran\n\nIf this was a REVIEW (oh wait, it is) i'd give this game a 9/10, i really love it...There is some room for improvement... but i can live with that... :)","January 24, 2014","true","10.3"," 217 of 234 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","217","234","0","9"

Also that the multiplayer version was a continue of the first version. I LOVE that there was a survival mode. I liked that there were parts that weren't even meant to scare the player, yet they did. I like how the game had a good storyline. I also love that it was free! The game even ran well (most of the time) on my bad laptop! The game had some scary parts, but was not overly-abusive about the jumpscares and other scary stuff...\n\nDislikes:\nI wish there was a create-your-own survival mode, even though I can understand that is back-breakingly hard to do... I at least wish the creator would've put more effort into the survival mode, making it easier in some way or less repetitive. The solo and multiplayer campaigns were VERY fun! However, there were some parts that annoyed me half to death. Some of the jump puzzles, the enemies that one shot you (sometimes), and least importantly... the enemy movement...\nI'm currently STUCK on the first part of chapter six with an annoying jump-puzzle... It's annoying! I also wish there was an item, or something, that would give you more inventory space.\n\nOverall:\nThe game was VERY good! There were some parts that were annoying and some things I wish existed, but with what the game has, it's GREAT!!! I give it 4.25 golden stars that don't exist anywhere, but my mind, but that counts for something ;)\n-P.S.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/joeybslash3/recommended/223710/","joeybslash3","JoeyBslash3","http://steamcommunity.com/id/joeybslash3/","304 products in account","Cry of Fear is simply the best Half-Life mod I have ever played, with the exception of Counter-Strike back in the day. This game shouldn't even be classified as a mod in my opinion. The engine has been utilized so well that there is little resemblence to the look of Half-Life.\n\nStory:\n\nThe story of Cry of Fear is worth experiencing for sure. I like the mystery aspects to the story and your character's journey in figuring out what's going on. There are many WTF moments, which I like in survival horror games. Plus, there are mutliple endings, so the replay value is decent. I don't want to give anything away, so you willl have to check it out yourself. Definitely plays with the mind and is more of a psychological horror thriller than a straight up jump scare horror game, which in my opinion makes for a much more interesting experience.\n\nGameplay:\n\nThis game truly is survival horror and the designers understand how to make the player feel like every resource is valuable. Similar to games like the early Bioharzard (Resident Evil) or Silent Hill games, items like firearms, ammunition, light sources, health, etc. all become scarce quickly if not rationed correctly and you always feel relieved to find more. There are times where I decided to sprint past enemies instead of trying to take them out since I didn't have enough ammunition or they were heavy in numbers. Speaking of enemies, there is a decent variety to them and they are creepy as hell. The animations make them very disturbing, and the sound effects that belong to each of them unnerve your senses. As for the objectives, they are usually pretty simple for the most part. There is a lot of back tracking, but it does make sense within the story, so it didn't really become annoying. There were some areas where I got confused on where to go, but to me, this helps the experience more than hindering it. I don't always want to be told where to go or what to do so directly. Survival horror games should make you think for yourself. Most games lack this aspect. The firearms feel much more realistic  than most games. They have some serious recoil and the accuracy is fairly similar to the real thing, at least from my limited experience.\n\nGraphics:\n\nThe game is very well polished for being built on such an old engine compared to the new ones. There are many details on the characters and enemies that bring out their personalities or lack thereof. Since this is a FPS with third person cutscenes mostly, the hands and weapons look very realistic. Very good details, especially on the firearms. The animations are done very well and the designers really didn't try to shortcut anything. Lighting, color, post processing, water, textures, etc. were all done very well, especially for a free game. The only gripe I feel anyone can make is only because of how old the engine is for the game, so obviously the polygon count isn't nearly as high as modern games. The settings are very detailed and make you feel like you are there in Sweden, which is where the game takes place. You are mostly in an urban environment, cautiously going through the streets, alleys, sewers, parks, buildings, etc. However, there are some other settings such as the forest and suburban areas.\n\nOverall:\n\nThis game has accomplished everything it set out to do in my opinion. The sound design and music compliment the harsh disturbing atmosphere and really creeps you out, especially when you don't know what's around the next corner. The graphics are great for the resources used, the gameplay is true survival horror, and it's FREE!!! So, sit back, turn the lights off, turn up the volume, have a weapon near you along with a change of pants if need be, and enjoy this game.

Lonely, depressed, suicidal, and angry. These are only some words to explain Simon, the main character. The game allows you to play as this run down man trying to find hope, answers, love. Loneliness has turned this man into something he's not, loneliness changes lives. For everyone who thinks popularity will make you cool, gtfo. You help ruin lives, destroy love, and kill others. You bully the kids who you think are "lame". Next thing you know, they kill themselves, all because you want to be popular. This game can change the way you look at the world today. You will feel horrible, sad, angry. This game shows us what bullying, and loneliness can do to people. If you just think popularity will get you somewhere in life, you won't like what you did when your dead. Simon is what many people feel like. Team Psykskallar hits this dead on. They show what loneliness can do to people.\n10/10","May 28, 2014","true","157.6"," 225 of 277 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","225","277","0","26"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheRealDoomguy/recommended/223710/","TheRealDoomguy","๖doomSday","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheRealDoomguy/","371 products in account","I remember waiting for the mod to come out for months at a time. It just looked like it was going to be the greatest thing ever. An atmospheric survival horror that let you fight back, just like Silent Hill or Resident Evil. Except this one is in the first person! At the time, I thought it was going to be one of the greatest single player mods ever. And that's exactly what we got.\n\nGraphically, this game goes beyong what the GoldSrc engine seemed to be capable of. The use of filters and high poly models, various graphical effects and I was blown out of my seat when I saw that water. This certainly isn't a bad looking game, even from a design standpoint. Even though the game is dark and dreary, the locations really felt like how they were supposed to. It really felt like I was wandering the city streets, or getting lost in the forest at night, or breaking into abandoned buildings. It was a genuine feeling that most games don't have today even with their emphasis on detail.\n\nThe gameplay wasn't god awful but it still made you feel hindered. You had to take your time aiming and be careful with your shots to conserve ammo. Sometimes you'd have to abandon certain weapons because you couldn't carry all of them including the key items, but there was that chance you could back track and pick up that weapon later. What I liked the most is that the use of things such as sprinting and using the sights on your guns fit in with the game well. Sure, it slowed down the game but regarding your ammo, that felt necessary. The enemies are great, too. Each with their own unique set of skills and abilities as well as their macabre designs. It fits in with the game's abandoned otherworldly atmosphere perfectly.\n\nThe game isn't even that short, either. In fact, it's pretty lengthy for a mod and rivals some AAA titles in terms of length and content. as you can see from my hours, it took me a while to beat this game because I felt like I needed to take my time with it. Having to go back and get weapons, dying to things I wasn't familiar with, struggling with puzzles, it felt like a game that would have stood its ground against the likes of the survival horror greats. The story is strange and, for some reason, it's logical as to why everything's so messed up.\n\nYou even have a bunch of stuff to unlock. It's mainly hoodies, but it's still something you can strive for in your multiple playthroughs, especially if you're looking to challenge yourself on the harder difficulties. It has multiplayer too, which is done in such a way that acts as a sequel. It does re-use the maps so that's a bit disappointing. The game itself is so good that it warrants a second playthrough just to experience the game again. Oh, and mods. There's mods for this game and they're not that bad either.\n\nAfter it's all said and done, I take a look at the game's development on ModDB and I can't help but think; This game was the last hurrah for GoldSrc mods. There hasn't been a GoldSrc mod to come out in recent years that had anywhere near the amount of hype this game had. It was played to death by let's players, it was critically acclaimed by the community, it was a beautiful thing to come out of this veteran mod team, being that these are the same guys who also made Afraid of Mosters, another brilliant GoldSrc mod. These are memories that I'm most likely not going to have again, anticipating for this mod as if no other game in the world mattered and the conversations that would ensue between my friends as we played it through on the day of its release made the experience all the more memorable. That was a little over three years ago, but the memories are still fresh in my mind.\n\ntl;dr, PLAY THIS GAME NOW.","March 21, 2015","true","15.4"," 90 of 94 people (96%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","96","90","94","11","0"

It's basically just elements from other survival horror games all rolled into one, but it doesn't really mix them all seamlessly. Also the main portion of the game is a fetch quest where you're going back and forth between large areas looking for a couple of items.\n\nInventory management is very strict as well so you often have to drop very useful items just to keep the game progressing. I also wonder if the voice acting is bad on purpose?\n\nAs a horror game it excels. Atmosphere, sound, design, everything looks and plays great but it's just very unfufilled in terms of gameplay. This is a free mod developed by a small team so you've got to give it credit for that, but just don't believe all the hype, this is a game with a lot of issues.\n\nFull Video Review:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7MemrRTp3g","February 25, 2015","true","8.0"," 142 of 171 people (83%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","83","142","171","11","0"

The game and pretty much everything about it is fantastic, with one glaring flaw: the drawbacks of using an engine as old as GldSource with so many modifications is that this game will crash. A lot.\n\nThis wouldn't be such an issue if you weren't relying on savepoints, but *SPOILERS AHEAD* I got stuck in the train tunnels where you have to use the flares because it managed to crash three times in a row at about the point where you get to the doctor. At that point I gave up. But if it says anything, it is good enough I'm likely going to try to get it to work tomorrow. If you are somebody who despises any game with the potential of losing progress due to poor mechanics, then maybe you should pass this up.\n\nOther than the stability issues, this is a superb game and it scared me quite a few times. I loved the inventory system, if I had one complaint about it, keys shouldn't count as items. I know it may be a 'drop a weapon so you can progress' kind of game at times, but the only effect taking up my inventory with keys has is making me backtrack for the sake of getting back certain weapons I had to drop to pick up some keys.\n\nThe music provided the perfect tone for every environment you can imagine, and was so good that it could create effective tension even in a room that is completely empty except for the player. I had a very nice time with this one, one of my all time favorite horrors in general.\n\nI'd recommend any fan of the genre pick this up if you have the time to get it working properly.\n\n_____\nEDIT: Got it to work and have beaten the game twice. The story and visual beauty is so compelling that I'd recommend you continue playing even if you do experience frequent crashes.\n\nFinal Score:\n\n9.5/10","May 30, 2015","true","7.9"," 65 of 70 people (93%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","93","65","70","9","0"

You can move, you can look around, and occasionally, fire a gun. It has graphics. It has lighting effects. It has a decent color pallet. It is also free to play, so you can't go wrong. It has a story unlike any other. It has enemies to combat. It also has allies that can help you on your quest. Unlike a lot of games nowadays, it has varied, thematic, set pieces. Don't let the title fool you, you won't be crying in fear, you will be crying about how amazing of an experience you've had, absolutely free, so you can save the money for passover. The movement is pretty dynamic. If you walk into a hard surface, you will stop. No longer will you have that lingering feeling that at any moment, you will fall through the floor. Oh, I forgot to mention that this game has a very engaging, and cinematic co-op experience. Each moment in co-op is unlike any other before it. You and your friends will experience a truly heart-wrenching, claustrophobic, gut-pounding, bowel movement-inducing, spoop filled catastrophe. Never has there been a more immersive co-op experience. The indie aspect truly shines throughout the many epic, magnificent, unanimous, diverse, open world realms. The only downside, and I truly regret to have to report on this, is the complete lack of an in depth character customization. Without a feature as crucial as character customization, I FEAR that this game will be overlooked by many. I CRY at the very thought that this game will go unnoticed. It is with all of my heart, that I recommend this game to everyone who enjoys a fast paced, adrenaline fueled, ride into the mind of the developers.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/glyphz/recommended/223710/","glyphz","jhyst3ria","http://steamcommunity.com/id/glyphz/","388 products in account","Let me just say I've never played Half-Life, and knowing Cry of Fear started as a mod of that game makes me very intrigued to try it out, being as Cry of Fear is one of my favorite games on Steam. I have never been so unsettled and on the edge of my seat while playing a video game before in my life. I have played all the Silent Hill games, Siren Blood Curse etc. but none of those games made me feel so happily full of dread as this game. I enjoy being frightened and shocked; to me it's the best part of being alive. I don't know where to start because in my opinion there are so many positive things I can say about this game. For starters, it makes me happy/sad that I finally got to play a protagonist that so openly displays himself as a "cutter". I have a huge amount of respect for the Devs for keeping it in the game. I'm not saying I approve of self-mutilation, on the contrary I am strongly against it, but it is a real thing that many people go through and for the Devs to shed light on this sensitive subject is very brave of them. Certain aspects of the game are challenging, for example: escaping the falling subway. But for me thats what makes it that much more rewarding and enjoyable. the game is very dark and disturbing, so if you are scared of being chased by a lunatic with a chainsaw, claustrophobic or "Facebook", I would think twice before trying this game. The dark matter in the game: self-mutilation, suicide and depression, are present throughout most of the game. The story is very well done, and I appreciate the fact that there are multiple endings (similar to Silent Hill games), which gives some replay value. Along with the extra unlockable content, which includes weapons and alternate clothing options. I've never tried out the co-op or Manhunt mode so I cannot give my opinion on that part of the game. The custom campaigns are a nice add on as well, but I would suggest waiting until you've played the campaign all the way through before playing them to fully appreciate and understand them.","January 23, 2015","true","34.2"," 45 of 49 people (92%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","92","45","49","4","0"

You play as a young man, Simon, desperately searching for answers in the cold Scandinavian night, finding his way through the city as he slowly descends into madness.\nThe single player campaign claims to take about eight hours time.\nThere is also another secret campaign after beating the first, then a completely separate co-op campaign, and multiple custom campaigns along with a custom campaign and map creator that is intuitive and easy to use.\nThe gameplay is like most survival horror games. You do have a backpack and your pockets but you cannot carry everything, forcing you to make sacrifices on what you want to carry and what you need to carry.\nCry of Fear's atmosphere is great, the dark corridors, the creepy forests to a tight packed school, the environments are varied and have a great way of getting you in the mood and into the game. Another aspect of the atmosphere in sound, Cry of Fear has a wonderful soundtrack with scary, dark tracks and beautiful melodies.\nCry of Fear was a Half-Life 1 mod that turned into a full free game. I  recommend it to everybody who loves horror games. You will not get anything better for free.\n\nSounds 9/10\nGraphics 7/10\nGameplay 8/10\nAtmosphere 10/10\n\nIf you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guides\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curation","August 3, 2013","true","0.2"," 93 of 127 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","93","127","0","4"

The only other game I could comapare this to "scary-wise" is PT the Silent Hills teaser on PS4. This game plays much differently than PT of course. The lore and atmosphere is so creepy and the character models, while not very detailed, are still horrifying. The little notes you pick up throughout the game will make you cringe and wonder, "what kind of creep made this game?". There are some puzzles which are moderately challenging and the combat isnt by any means great but thats not why you play this game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/shezzor/recommended/223710/","shezzor","shezzor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/shezzor/","666 products in account","I'll start by saying, if you're a horror fan you have no reason not to at least try this game. Its free and has a gripping and quite lengthy story driven campaign. Thats not to mention it also has a seperate coop campaign and even tools to make your own custom campaigns.\n\nYou follow a teen called Simon, a deeply troubled soul who for some reason gets caught up in a car accident. Upon his awake, he realises he's been left abondoned in unfamiliar territory only equipped with his mobile phone and pocket knife. Many questions have now been raised; How and why is he is here? How he did get away unscathed? Who and what are these shadowly figures that keep appearing around each new corner?\n\nThe game pretty much plays like any other survival horror game. You control SImon from first person view and move from A to B collecting various items and solved puzzles along with way. The atmosphere here is perfect and is only made better with the chilling soundtrack. Even though it can look a little dated now (which is probably down to this being a Half-Life 1, Source Gold engine mod to be fair), this seems to only help with the creepy factor. I do get a sense that this game was heavily influenced by the Silent Hill series due to the settings and surreal nature of the gameplay but again this is by no means a bad thing. It contains a plater of jump scares, some cheap and some less so but these are all well mixed with some very unique experiences.\n\nThats not to say the game doesnt have its problems. Some of the combat can be far too frequent at times giving it a repetitive feel. The maze-like map design can get confusing causing you re-tread many a room unnecessarily. Also the game does have tech and bug issues. I've had a number of crashes and random glitches but these were thankfully few and far between.\n\nOverall, I throughly enjoyed this and it has some excellent work on show. Its only a shame these guys wont get at least something in return for this. Highly recommended.","January 1, 2014","true","24.4"," 22 of 25 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","22","25","0","0"

It's better than most AAA titles and although this is just a mod, it's something very special. It has a well thought out story, nice combat and I can see that the developers definitely put a lot of effort into this. Literally every place, every boss fight and every monster has a relevance towards Simon and somehow reflects a part of his own life/state. I just want to say a bit about the story. It's based around Simon's life and his depressions and anxiety and how it develops and how he develops with it. You're basically trapped in your own nightmare that's building up due to your depressions and anxiety. I personally love this story. If you look carefully at certain elements of the game you'll find hints and clues that he's trapped inside his own nightmare and that he's suffering from severe depressions, caused by an accident.\n\nI would tell you more about the game and its story, but I don't want to spoil it for you.\n\nI can honestly recommend this game, I played through this very, very often, and it's a great experience.","January 7, 2014","true","194.2"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","16","18","0","2"

It feels more like a standalone game than a mod. It has some bugs here and there but they are not game breaking. The inventar system is very nice and reminds me of the RE inventar. The monster are so ♥♥♥♥ing crazy and different, actually I had more wtf moments from Cry of Fear than from the Silent Hill series. All the custom animations, sounds and cut scenes makes this mod really unique and special.\n\nAs I playing further and further I can see how much love they put into this piece of work. The replayability is pretty high on Cry of Fear since it has 6 different endings on singleplayer mode and it will unlock secret files plus items after each ending. ( The devs comments are very interesting too! Especially from "ruMpel" lol)\n\nPlayers who only want to enjoy the co-op mode will be a little disappointed here. You can't save your game in this mode nor going back to the previous map unlike in singleplayer where all the maps act as one big section. You will also need a network tool like hamachi in order to connect to your buddies server and sometimes you will be disconnected due to some bugs but nonetheless it is really fun to play the co-op mode with your friends :)\n\nWell, this game is pretty sick and disturbing sometimes... don't play it if you are under depression or a scaredy cat :D","January 30, 2015","true","39.3"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","14","15","0","3"

This game is one of those gems that define real survival horror. You'll probably need to go shopping for new pants after you're done with this game, assuming you'll have the balls to finish it all the way to the end. This game is very well made. The story is very engaging and the suspense and horror factor in this game is nothing to joke about. The graphics may be outdated by today's gaming standards, but give this game a try and you will not regret picking it up and adding it to your gaming library. In fact, this beats out most survival and horror games on steam...and this one is free! I would have gladly paid for this game for its full price without the need of a steam sale when I first discovered it. It was a godsend that the developer of this game decided to make it free. To show my support for this game, I shall list down an honest review of what I believe the game has made me experience.\n\nPROS:\n\n- For a game that was based on the old Half-Life engine, it is very well made and polished.\n- The horror factor in this game is unquestionable. You like getting your pants soiled constantly? Play this game.\n- The story is quite engaging and is a realistic take on people who suffer from the particular illness the protagonist is going through.\n- Realistic atmosphere and creepy environment adds to the horror factor of the game.\n- Classic game, one that will keep you on the edge of your seats the whole time.\n- Ever played Silent Hill? This game is pretty much on par with it.\n- This game has the most disturbing and creepy looking enemies you will face.\n- Online co-op.\n\nCONS:\n\n- There are some areas in the game that are VERY dark by design, even with the flashlight. You might wanna boost your brightness settings a little bit.\n- Controls may feel a little clunky at first, but overtime, you'll get used to it and it will seem more fluid as the game progresses.\n- PewDiePie once did a LP of this game. I rest my case.\n- The save system and inventory is a little bit troublesome to navigate through and get used to, but like the others, you will get used to it as you progress more with the game.\n\nI love horror games even though sometimes I don't have the balls to play them. I'll give this game a solid 9/10.\n\nI highly recommend it for both horror casuals and veterans alike.","November 24, 2015","true","0.3"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","87","13","15","3","1"

For someone who is unfamiliar to these sorts of conditions this game may come off slightly hyperrealistic and only distorted for the horror aspect of the game, but that is not the case. Like a lot of other people, the main character's monsters all represent something he deals with in the real world, whether that being personal relationships, or his anger towards the world in the first place. Not only is the story solid, but the game play is easy to follow, yes there are times you must go back through an area you've already seen, but in doing so you begin to see how our main character sees everything as repetitive. The whole game is about the main character and what these depressing thoughts and anxiety riddled interations play a part in his life and what they do to him mentally. Cry of Fear is truley a step up from Team Psykskallar's orginal title 'Afraid of Monsters' not only in the horror aspect of the game, but story wise as well. Really hoping to see more titles from them soon.","May 24","true","0.5"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","13","15","0","1"

You must solve some puzzles to continue playing, and you need to be a good player if you want to beat all the creepy monsters and to grab all the weapons. It's awesome how everything has a meaning, each monster, every situation, all the scenery. I loved the end, all makes sense when you finish the game.  The ending depends on the decisions you make throughout the game.\nThe bosses are epic and very originals, its a challenge to defeat them.\nThe only downside to the game are the graphics (And I'm not sure If I have to count this as a bad point) and the technical issues (it crashes a lot or get some bugs) but if you can beat the bosses, I'm pretty sure than you can beat the technical issues.\n\n9.5/10 ♥","June 16, 2015","true","1.1"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","8","9","0","0"

Seriously, it is a free game, i would be ready to pay like 15$ for it. I even donated to developers, i realy like it. My advise: when autumn comes, get some alcohol, get 10 hours to beat this game, and after finishing it, enjoy your new suicidal thoughts :DDD\n\nЭто моя любимая игра всех времен. Сюжет здесь, трогательный аж до слез. Каждую осень моя депрессия достигает своего пика, и играя в эту игру, можно ощютить на своей шкуре как ужасно чувствует себя Саймон. Эта игра отлично олицетворяет депрессию. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, это бесплатная игра, я бы заплатил даже, так я и сделал, разрабам 300 рублей донатнул.

It's still as fun as ever.\nAnd there's multiple endings, so you can play as many times as you want.\n\nThe co-op, in my opinion, is so much fun. You are cops who have teamed up to destroy the zombies/monsters that have invaded the town. I love the fact that at the start of the final level, it gives you VP70's, sledgehammers and shotguns.\n\nSo, if you're looking for a spoop, play this game.

The atmosphere in itself is just dark, metallic, tense, and irks danger more often than not. The way the world is built around this is pretty damn good too, it does it right.\n\nUnlike Afraid of Monsters where ammunition worked in the same way as Half-Life, this game does it tradionally, with there being a magazine counter rather than total rounds in reserve; any time you reload you dump all the rounds in the last mag, no ifs ands or butts about it, it's gone.","September 26, 2014","true","143.0"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

The scripting is the best ive ever seen, it has multiple endings which makes it even more interesting and the difficulty is really well made. Ammo and health are limited, you need to know how to save it, enemies come in bigger numbers as you progress through out the game which makes it hard to survive unless you know how to use your ammo and health without wasting it, melee weapons become useless as you encounter tougher enemies (thats the game's way of saying: USE YOUR GUNS, NO MORE MELEE ), the co-op mode, even tho is dead, it reveals more important aspects of the story, and ALL of this without any cost......

You play as Simon, just some ordinary guy suffering from severe depression and what I think, due to the monsters, some schizophrenia. The game starts off with a segment of a man crawling towards Simon, uging for help, but Simon does not respond in kind and harms the man, bashing his head into a wall. Then there's a few fades to a blood-soaked padded cell, but the blood seems to spell something. Then the game cuts back to Simon, who stands around for a second before getting hit by an off-roading vehicle. Then there is some gameplay where you take pictures of the letter X that reveal a sinister plot and then a face screaming at you in the end.\nWaking up in an alleyway with no recollection of what exactly happened before-hand armed with a (Slightly blood-stained) knife and a cell phone. Checking on his phone, he gets a text from his mother, urging him to come home, however; Simon cannot respond, as he has no service. (We all know that feeling, eh?) Then you embark on an adventure through the town on finding a way to get back home.\nThis is the introduction to Cry of Fear, originally a Half-life mod and later a full Steam release, which I will be reviewing because I have no clue what the difference is but if there is one, you're getting the Steam release. This game is made by the same dev team who made Afraid of Monsters: Directors Cut. Winning quite a number of Indie Game awards, and rightfully so. But, just a fair warning, this game is grim and can cause nightmares.\nSome things could turn one off about this game, such as dated graphics and a slightly odd control scheme.\n\nPros\n+Story Rich\n+Great voice acting\n+Amazing add-on maps\n+Spooks all around!\n+Guns don't feel too over-powered and feel as though they're tools for survival\n+Puzzles that aren't too difficult but aren't too easy\nCons\n-MP is difficult to operate without Hamachi\n-difficult platforming sections\n-monsters are a bit difficult if that's a con to you.\n\nTotal rating: 9.75/10","July 4, 2014","true","12.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The co-op is buggy so you may need hamachi, however when you get the Co-op to work its just amazing with a friend. What makes it even better is that... Well its free so there is really no reason not to buy this amazing game.","January 12, 2014","true","0.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kingofnynrah/recommended/223710/","kingofnynrah","Kon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kingofnynrah/","65 products in account","Well, this is really something else.\n\nBefore playing Cry of Fear I wasn't really into horror games - in fact, I don't think I ever played any at all with the exception of a bit of Amnesia and SCP: Containment Breach. The reason I downloaded CoF was because it was a mod for HL1, and I was having serious Half-Life withdrawal symptoms at the time (seriously, where is episode 3?). What I got was not only an encouraging introduction into the horror genre, but one of the best games I've ever played in terms of character, story and suspense.\n\nIn particular, the protagonist, a nineteen year old Swedish guy named Simon, really struck a chord with me. Before playing this game I was having some serious issues in my life, dealing with heartbreak and severe anxiety to name a few. I can't say much without spoiling the plot, but the mental trauma that he went through and the way he responded to it let me know that I wasn't alone with these problems. The immersive gameplay of CoF helped me a lot and allowed me to connect to the protagonist more than any other before.\n\nBut anyway. As far as gameplay goes, it's relatively simple - if you've HL1 or any other Valve-made FPS, you should have no problem learning the controls. Unique to CoF is the inventory system, in which you can store up to 6 items, and the ability to duel-wield specific weapons. The puzzles are also challenging without being ridiculously hard, and if you get stuck like I did on the "park puzzle" with the statues then don't be afraid to look the answer up on Youtube.\n\nOne criticism though. In order to avoid cheating, the developers have removed most of the console commands which would help you if, say, you're halfway through the game with low health, no ammo, and stuck in a room with 6 monsters armed only with your switchblade. This happened to me and I actually had to go into the game files and modify the damage values for the switchblade in order to progress. Not cool, Team Psykskallar, not cool! What if somebody encountered a game-breaking bug and got stuck in a wall or something? They wouldn't be able to noclip out.\n\nStill, that's pretty much the only criticism I have about this game. Everything else is spot on. If you're a hardened horror fan or relatively new to the genre like me, be sure to give it a go. It's free, after all.\n\n","June 29, 2014","true","16.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I soon came to realize that this game represents the exploitation of the working class by the aristocratic bourgeoisie reptilian semites from Babylonian antiquity. The game mirrors the human endeavor to arise from the mundane and materialistic plane unto the divine and immortal sphere of the enlightened ones through multiple reincarnations. I came to understand the role of the modern emasculated man living in the Kali Yuga, to live as an ascetic warrior resisting the facade of the modern liberal monoculture.

You play as Simon, just some ordinary guy suffering from severe depression and what I think, due to the monsters, some schizophrenia. The game starts off with a segment of a man crawling towards Simon, uging for help, but Simon does not respond in kind and harms the man, bashing his head into a wall. Then there's a few fades to a blood-soaked padded cell, but the blood seems to spell something. Then the game cuts back to Simon, who stands around for a second before getting hit by an off-roading vehicle. Then there is some gameplay where you take pictures of the letter X that reveal a sinister plot and then a face screaming at you in the end.\nWaking up in an alleyway with no recollection of what exactly happened before-hand armed with a (Slightly blood-stained) knife and a cell phone. Checking on his phone, he gets a text from his mother, urging him to come home, however; Simon cannot respond, as he has no service. (We all know that feeling, eh?) Then you embark on an adventure through the town on finding a way to get back home.\nThis is the introduction to Cry of Fear, originally a Half-life mod and later a full Steam release, which I will be reviewing because I have no clue what the difference is but if there is one, you're getting the Steam release. This game is made by the same dev team who made Afraid of Monsters: Directors Cut. Winning quite a number of Indie Game awards, and rightfully so.  But, just a fair warning, this game is grim and can cause nightmares.\nSome things could turn one off about this game, such as dated graphics and a slightly odd control scheme.\n\nPros\n+Story Rich\n+Great voice acting\n+Amazing add-on maps\n+Spooks all around!\n+Guns don't feel too over-powered and feel as though they're tools for survival\n+Puzzles that aren't too difficult but aren't too easy\nCons\n-MP is difficult to operate without Hamachi\n-difficult platforming sections\n-monsters are a bit difficult if that's a con to you.\n\nTotal rating: 9.75/10","March 29, 2014","true","24.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TerraNovaClick/recommended/223710/","TerraNovaClick","Terran","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TerraNovaClick/","110 products in account","Cry of Fear is a truly sublime experience. It combines surprisingly excellent game-play reminiscing earlier Silent Hill and Resident Evil games. It balances fear and gameplay well, relying on an interesting variety of weapons (Although most lacking a unique flavor), and proper "Thrills" around every corner without becoming repetitive. There are heart-pounding moments, chest-chilling experiences and some crazy story going on. Plus, there's free mod content across the board, and the game is FREE!\n\nThere are a TON of unlockables, relying on skills and reaction timing to unlock, expanding game-play and promoting new and unique experiences. I really cannot express how much fun I had on both single-player and co-op. This is a game that I highly, HIGHLY recommend. If you enjoyed Biohazard (Resident Evil) and earlier Silent Hill games, then this is for you. Don't let the HL1 engine fool you; - The graphics, while simple and almost blocky at times blend perfectly with the survival horror for an incredible experience.\n\nThanks for reading! My final rating is a FAMAS/10.","January 24, 2015","true","40.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

If you're a fan of horror games and you're reading this on a pc you own, there is absolutely no reason for you to have NOT played this. Its (sadly) free, and amazing. Go play it now.","September 2, 2014","true","47.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jonathanissexyboy/recommended/223710/","Jonathanissexyboy","binarydood","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jonathanissexyboy/","90 products in account","One of the best survival horrors out there. The influence of Silent Hill (especially 2) is clearly visible on both gameplay and theme, but capturing that kind of atmosphere and mood can only be a compliment, A huge one. And worry not because Cry of Fear does have a really strong identity of it's own.\nThe limitations of the Gold Source engine are barely noticeble due to just how much the original game was modifyed, however, like Half Life, Cry of Fear also changes gameplay mechanics from times to times, depending on the scenario you're in. For a horror game, Cry of Fear does this tremendously well, and except for a few moments of the game (like the falling train sequence) the game manages to use the change of it way of playing as a way of provoking fear into the player rather than frustration, since from a moment to another you will be forced to think in a different way if you want to progress.\nThe story like I said earlier, is incredibly influenced by Silent Hill, however, it is obvious that alot of it came from the creator's life experiences. One thing I must criticize is that not all monsters seem to represent imidiatly Simons guilt and fears, some of them are just twisted and disturbing for the sake of being twisted and disturbing, but, while they dont offer much in terms of the main characters' psyche, they do offer more variety of gameplay, since Cry of Fear does have many diferent types of enemies. All I can say plot-wise is that it takes it's time to reveal what's actually going on, and the closer you get to the truth, the more twisted and nightmaqrish the visuals of the game will become, to express the depression and suicidal tendencies of the protagonist.\nThe gameplay is filled with subtle details that are mostly overlooked even by the greatest of the surival horror genre, wether old or new. The presence of those elements only make this game grimmer and genuinly terrifying, since they add depth to the game, and you will have to consider their use if you want to survive due to the scarce resources.\nI was also incredibly impressed due to the quantity of bonus material. You get a bunch of new game modes, extra weapons, developer commentary, diferent outfits, trophys, pages of Simon's book, and also, parts of the game switch simply by starting new playtroughts. For example, codes for specific doors change so you cant simply resort to online help to solve a puzzle. There are also TONS of easter eggs in the game, 4 diferent endings on the main singleplayer, theres multiplayer and 4 different difficulty settings. Also, props to the sound design and music, it's also great.\n\nFor a free game this is absolutly amazing, and for such a small team of developers... Then my god you guys have created a masterpiece. It is one of the scariest games I've ever played, dont let the terrible jumpscare screamer at the beginning reflect how the rest of the game is gonna be. And if you like Cry of Fear, then I highly recoment Afraid of Monsters as well, but that one you will have to install like a regular Half Life mod. This game, at least for me, proved that both game with combat or without combat can be just as scary as one another, taking diferent routes for their game design.\n\nSo, if you are a horror fan, why arent you playing Cry of Fear yet?","February 2, 2014","true","15.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I no longer require sleep anymore (but who needed that anyway?).\n\nThe graphics are kinda old looking but that makes the game even worse because it causes the enemies to look more grotesque than a realistic game would. I prefer playing retro games anyway and I always find non-realistic looking games to look and play much better.\n\nOn the whole, a terrifyingly-poopdedoop yourself- enjoyable experience and I highly recommend this game if you enjoy survival horror games, like Half Life mods (or are constipated).","June 9, 2014","true","14.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Shutdown. Curse that.\n\n''Cry of Fear is a psychological single-player and co-op horror game set in a deserted town filled with horrific creatures and nightmarish delusions. You play as a young man desperately searching for answers in the cold Scandinavian night, finding his way through the city as he slowly descends into madness.''\n\nI've seen my most fear, in this game. Therefore, it's one of the scariest games out there. Not only scary, but it gave me a huge impact of depression. A lots of depression. Not that point where I would kill myself, but this is kind of traumatic to young people like me. If you mind I'm 15, before you think it's a 9. :P\n\nSure it was fun to play cooperative with friends, shoot zawmbeez, and monsters like L4D. I was mistaken, once. There was this map which scared the hell outta me, and I would just want to quit the game even there's a friend. two at most. It caused aa lot of depression and illusion to me, like you see big bloody hands, chains, bloods all around, tentacles, hanged men and women, question marks, and stuff. The soundtrack makes it even more spooky.\n\nIt's just.. Can't play on that map, again.\n\nOn the other hand, however, I didn't want to play the campaign even if it's the main point of the game. Note that, I am a 'scaredyshroom' guy, who never wanted to play alone. Though, playing campaign is 2x kook-the-spookier than that of Co-Op. 10/10 did not play and won't play.\n\nLet's take out the 'Serious Sam' outta this review and talk about the verdict!\n\nThe Verdict\n\nThe Good:\n-Cooperative\n-Sucessful scaring\n-Simon's realistic stuff\n-Simon's hood looks like an assassin's\n-Cleverly eerie soundtrack\n\nThe Bad:\n-Glitchy\n-Buggy\n-Buggy everything\n-Buggy menu\n-Buggy menu\n-Another BUGGY MENU!!\n-Buggy buttons\n-Crashes everytime for a slight reason\n-When it does all these, 10/10 you would launch for a scan for Viruses\n\nThe Ugly:\n-The way Simon shoots himself\n-Cannot jump over stuffs\n-You'll often run out of ammo which gives you alot of scarcity\n\nThose bugs were a huuuge letdown for this game so:\n\nRecommended for those how want to have some spooky time!\n\n\n7.6/10","June 23, 2014","true","2.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

Of course, that's part of the fun.\n\nI liked how there are other game types other than just the campaign, and the campaign itself has good replayability.

MOSTLY.  Now lemme tell you why (prepare for the obligatory rant)...\n\nSAVE AND CHECKPOINTING SYSTEMS.  Yeah, I'm gonna go on about those...AGAIN.  But I really do live in a world full of hope...the hope that one day, game designers (both "amateur" and "professional") might realise that NOT ALL PEOPLE WHO ENJOY GAMES SPEND THEIR ENTIRE LIVES PLAYING THEM.  We semi-committed gamers, for instance, certainly seek a CHALLENGE when we play games...but we don't enjoy it when a game chooses to be so stubbornly, pig-headedly "hard" that we feel like THROWING OUR LAPTOPS OUT THE ♥♥♥♥ING WINDOW.  If you're going to put in insanely tricky bits of jumping, rendered three times harder still by surreal, otherworldly physics which don't quite translate when the graphics are a tad on the "low-res" side, please...PLEASE...put one or two checkpoints along the way so we don't have to do those first five finicky jumps EIGHTY-SEVEN ♥♥♥♥ING TIMES before we master that one jump that we can't quite get our stupid heads around.  And that oh-so-clever bit of uber-jumping up the crashed train car before it drops off the cliff?  Don't make me do that first combination of walk-forward/jump-up/turn-left/crouch-jump/two-steps-forward/turn-right/jump-WITHOUT-crouch-or-you'll-hit-your-head-and-fall-back-down/forward-one-step-and-one-step-only/etc etc etc OVER AND OVER AGAIN, without a single save or checkpoint along the way...please?!?  Though I really did love that final touch where I finally, after Lord-knows how many attempts, made it to the top, and what happens?  I turned the WRONG WAY (it was a fifty-fifty chance) once safely out of the train car, and somehow still managed to go plummeting to my death for the NINETY-SIXTH TIME!!!\n\nThis ♥♥♥♥ is not fun, kids.  It's just anger-inducing.  And plain-old INSULTING to people who've already invested a number of hours into your otherwise rather excellent and refreshingly JUMPING-FREE game.  Two more things on this subject:  One, all games need to have a "natural"-seeming learning curve, where if you're going to do something like a pedantically-difficult jumping bit, it needs to be PRECEDED by similar-though-not-quite-as-hard bits which prepare the player for what is to come.  That's just sound GAME DESIGN.  Secondly...pedantically-difficult jumping bits really don't even WORK in a FIRST-PERSON GAME.  The first-person view just isn't suited to it.  If you wanna make a platform game, please make it in THIRD-person.  But enough of the incensed ranting, and on with the good stuff...\n\nCry Of Fear is one of the scariest games you will ever play, and one of the best first-person games you will probably ever play, period.  It's chock-full of great ideas.  A few silly ones, granted, and a ♥♥♥♥-tonne of rather derivative ones...but if you've ever wanted to know what the early Silent Hill games would have been like in single-person, you couldn't do much better than this.  SO many well-calculated scares, a likeable and intriguing if not entirely "logical" plot, suitably loony voice-acting and...well, just so much for a dyed-in-the-wool horror fan to love.  Which is maybe not surprising, considering what a labour of love this game/mod clearly was.  Just a wee bit of game-testing OUTSIDE of the hardcore, played-it-all-before, this-is-my-four-hundred-and-twenty-fifth-first-person-shooter-and-I-can-play-Half-Life-1-through-in-under-two-hours-with-one-hand-tied-behind-my-back crowd...and we could'a had a very nearly PERFECT game experience here.\n\nI so very nearly love it, but I don't know when I'll muster up the courage to play it again...NOT because of how ♥♥♥♥-your-pants-scary it so often is, but because I really, really, REALLY don't want to ever have to do those two aforementioned ♥♥♥♥♥♥ jumping bits EVER AGAIN.  IN MY ENTIRE LIFE.  But I probably will...which is testament, surely, to how good the REST of the game truly is (okay, there's a few other crappy bits too, but those two truly take the cake).  Can't wait 'til these guys make a "real" (read: commercially-produced) game, with someone else's money, and all the quality control which (regrettably) only seems to come with that level of corporate overlording.  GETTING PEWDIEPIE TO GAME-TEST YOUR PRODUCT IS NOT THE WAY TO CREATE A WIDELY-ACCESSIBLE, UNIVERSALLY-PLAYABLE PRODUCT!!!  Find some people with full-time jobs, and see if THEY can get through your bloody game!!!!!!\n\nPS  I haven't yet played this one on Steam, so if the above ranting about lack of save/checkpoints is now null and void, I profusely apologise.  Having said that, I haven't seen any pigs flying outside my window tonight, so I'm kinda doubting such a miracle has taken place.  But again...WORLD FULL OF HOPE.  And really nasty, ♥♥♥♥ed-in-the-head horror games.  That's the world I wanna live in.\n\nVerdict: 9/10.","December 13, 2013","true","0.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

I don't know why people would not download this game since it's one of the best on steam and it's FREE. Like a first person Silent Hill game with more action and shooting, but the action doesn't ruin it. The only issue I have is the fact that the multiplayer is completely broken. It's almost impossible to play with friends let alone other people. Unfortunately with no new news or updates there looks like there hasn't been any efforts to fix it either. The only way you'll be able to play is if you find someone (such as myself) that portforwarded the game.... or if they use Hamachi like a scroob. I have hosted games for multiple people and beat the co-op campaigns multiple times, so if you're interested but have no friends to host, add me and I will if I'm not busy. If for nothing else though, download it for the campaign, it's free... so why not?","June 21, 2014","true","659.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","3"

MOSTLY.  Now lemme tell you why (prepare for the obligatory rant)...\n\nSAVE AND CHECKPOINTING SYSTEMS.  Yeah, I'm gonna go on about those...AGAIN.  But I really do live in a world full of hope...the hope that one day, game designers (both "amateur" and "professional") might realise that NOT ALL PEOPLE WHO ENJOY GAMES SPEND THEIR ENTIRE LIVES PLAYING THEM.  We semi-committed gamers, for instance, certainly seek a CHALLENGE when we play games...but we don't enjoy it when a game chooses to be so stubbornly, pig-headedly "hard" that we feel like THROWING OUR LAPTOPS OUT THE ♥♥♥♥ING WINDOW.  If you're going to put in insanely tricky bits of jumping, rendered three times harder still by surreal, otherworldly physics which don't quite translate when the graphics are a tad on the "low-res" side, please...PLEASE...put one or two checkpoints along the way so we don't have to do those first five finicky jumps EIGHTY-SEVEN ♥♥♥♥ING TIMES before we master that one jump that we can't quite get our stupid heads around.  And that oh-so-clever bit of uber-jumping up the crashed train car before it drops off the cliff?  Don't make me do that first combination of walk-forward/jump-up/turn-left/crouch-jump/two-steps-forward/turn-right/jump-WITHOUT-crouch-or-you'll-hit-your-head-and-fall-back-down/forward-one-step-and-one-step-only/etc etc etc OVER AND OVER AGAIN, without a single save or checkpoint along the way...please?!?  Though I really did love that final touch where I finally, after Lord-knows how many attempts, made it to the top, and what happens?  I turned the WRONG WAY (it was a fifty-fifty chance) once safely out of the train car, and somehow still managed to go plummeting to my death for the NINETY-SIXTH TIME!!!\n\nThis ♥♥♥♥ is not fun, kids.  It's just anger-inducing.  And plain-old INSULTING to people who've already invested a number of hours into your otherwise rather excellent and refreshingly JUMPING-FREE game.  Two more things on this subject:  One, all games need to have a "natural"-seeming learning curve, where if you're going to do something like a pedantically-difficult jumping bit, it needs to be PRECEDED by similar-though-not-quite-as-hard bits which prepare the player for what is to come.  That's just sound GAME DESIGN.  Secondly...pedantically-difficult jumping bits really don't even WORK in a FIRST-PERSON GAME.  The first-person view just isn't suited to it.  If you wanna make a platform game, please make it in THIRD-person.  But enough of the incensed ranting, and on with the good stuff...\n\nCry Of Fear is one of the scariest games you will ever play, and one of the best first-person games you will probably ever play, period.  It's chock-full of great ideas.  A few silly ones, granted, and a ♥♥♥♥-tonne of rather derivative ones...but if you've ever wanted to know what the early Silent Hill games would have been like in single-person, you couldn't do much better than this.  SO many well-calculated scares, a likeable and intriguing if not entirely "logical" plot, suitably loony voice-acting and...well, just so much for a dyed-in-the-wool horror fan to love.  Which is maybe not surprising, considering what a labour of love this game/mod clearly was.  Just a wee bit of game-testing OUTSIDE of the hardcore, played-it-all-before, this-is-my-four-hundred-and-twenty-fifth-first-person-shooter-and-I-can-play-Half-Life-1-through-in-under-two-hours-with-one-hand-tied-behind-my-back crowd...and we could'a had a very nearly PERFECT game experience here.\n\nI so very nearly love it, but I don't know when I'll muster up the courage to play it again...NOT because of how ♥♥♥♥-your-pants-scary it so often is, but because I really, really, REALLY don't want to ever have to do those two aforementioned ♥♥♥♥♥♥ jumping bits EVER AGAIN.  IN MY ENTIRE LIFE.  But I probably will...which is testament, surely, to how good the REST of the game truly is (okay, there's a few other crappy bits too, but those two truly take the cake).  Can't wait 'til these guys make a "real" (read: commercially-produced) game, with someone else's money, and all the quality control which (regrettably) only seems to come with that level of corporate overlording.  GETTING PEWDIEPIE TO GAME-TEST YOUR PRODUCT IS NOT THE WAY TO CREATE A WIDELY-ACCESSIBLE, UNIVERSALLY-PLAYABLE PRODUCT!!!  Find some people with full-time jobs, and see if THEY can get through your bloody game!!!!!!\n\nPS  I haven't yet played this one on Steam, so if the above ranting about lack of save/checkpoints is now null and void, I profusely apologise.  Having said that, I haven't seen any pigs flying outside my window tonight, so I'm kinda doubting such a miracle has taken place.  But again...WORLD FULL OF HOPE.  And really nasty, ♥♥♥♥ed-in-the-head horror games.  That's the world I wanna live in.\n\nVerdict: 9/10.","December 13, 2013","true","0.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

I'm rather good at the original Silent Hill though. Thats the kinda vibe this game gave me when I first played it. You wake up in a strange place with hardly any explanantion or anything and then *BAM* jumpscare. I first played this game at school with my friends, bad idea. The controls are solid. This game started as a mod for Half-Life so of course the controls are good. The graphichs look nice (a bit dated) and the film grain effect adds a nice touch of horror. I tried to play it, couldn't get past the opening. I don't really have any niggles with the game (haven't played much) but the loading times can take long and crash sometimes. When I first played it, I saw the task manager open at least 4 times. When it got running, it was rather freightining. I've tried to convince my mates to get it as it has CO-OP, but they don't like horror games. As we like to say: 3 spooky, 5 me. Its free so download it if you like horror, want to wet yourself or you're just insane. Haven't played enough to give a proper rating, but the game looks promising.

One of the best mods of all time, does a fantastic job of disguising the fact that it's even running on goldsource. Best played with a friend, or if you plan on going insane or dying of a heart attack, alone.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Florastamine/recommended/223710/","Florastamine","Florastamine","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Florastamine/","156 products in account","Pros:\n- Amazing graphics despite being done with the ( modified ) Half-Life engine - I've never thought it could do water reflections, specular bump-mapping, post-processing effects and rain ( never seen rain in the original Half-Life ).\n- Jumpscares, although being used a lot, come with a lot of variants so I don't get tired of them. You'll never know what is waiting at the next corner.\n- Sound and music design are quite good. There are a few silent sections, which I believe the developers did it on purpose. Like Akira Yamaoka said: "Silence is also a sound."\n- Tons of extra unlockables and custom campaigns after beating the main game, and even the single player alone is more than enough for a free game ( +/- 8 hours ).\n\nCons:\n- The limited inventory system can sometimes get a bit hilarious. For example, a key and a spade takes up the same amount of storage ( 1 slot ).\n- Sawrunner spots are quite predictable thanks to these save points. ( could fix this by implementing an auto-save system which saves game in the background without noticing the player about it ).\n- Frustrating backtrack sections.\n- Puzzles are irrelevant to the story being told. The same to item placements ( who the hell put ammo in the bus anyway? )\n- Obstacles seem obvious to bypass, can't be bypassed.\n\nOverall, this is a great Silent Hill/Penumbra hybrid and any horror fan must have it. And it's free.","January 8, 2015","true","24.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

For a mod/standalone game that isn't much old [2013 released] it does have it's promise as a good survival horror FPS, There are some jumpscares, fears that you have to run your ♥♥♥ good against some enemies you cannot kill then this is the survival horror for you. You can only hold six items much like Chris Redfield from Resident Evil. This game is hard so I'd recommend starting on Easy to get used to how the game plays.\n\nI'd give this a 8.3 / 10. This game apparently needs a good gaming PC to Run despite it having the Half Life 1 engine. Which is a bit of BS. Because before I got my Gaming PC. I tried on numerous occasions to get this running on my laptop only to close down itself since it's able to play Half Life 2 games without any lage: but the bright side is that it's a freebie so you can play this game for your own enjoyment without any money spent and it has custom stories too!

For a mod/standalone game that isn't much old [2013 released] it does have it's promise as a good survival horror FPS, There are some jumpscares, fears that you have to run your ♥♥♥ good against some enemies you cannot kill then this is the survival horror for you. You can only hold six items much like Chris Redfield from Resident Evil. This game is hard so I'd recommend starting on Easy to get used to how the game plays.\n\nI'd give this a 8.3 / 10. This game apparently needs a good gaming PC to Run despite it having the Half Life 1 engine. Which is a bit of BS. Because before I got my Gaming PC. I tried on numerous occasions to get this running on my laptop only to close down itself since it's able to play Half Life 2 games without any lage: but the bright side is that it's a freebie so you can play this game for your own enjoyment without any money spent and it has custom stories too!

Been there done that right? Haha... WRONG!\nDesigned and created by a small team out of Sweden, Cry of Fear aims to do what many other games in the genre attempt to do: Scare the ♥♥♥♥ out of you. However, Cry of Fear seems to be one of the few that ACTUALLY scares the ♥♥♥♥ out of you.\nI will be breaking down this game into 5 parts: Presentation, Graphics, Audio, Ease of Use and Gameplay followed by a verdict for anyone who wants the skinny on Cry of Fear.\n\nPresentation\nFrom the moment you enter the world of Cry of Fear (abv .CoF), it's clear that things are FUBAR. I won't give away too many details regarding the story as that is something you should experience for yourself, especially the intro.... ANYWAYS! You play as a seemingly young aged man(SImon) who is in desperate need of the worlds' best psychologist.  Simon(you) arrive in a city with no real recollection of how you got there. Armed only with your mobile phone and a switchblade, its up to you to brave the dark city and uncover what secrets it may hold.\n"Yeah, yeah dude get on with the review!" Meh...\nI have to say I love the atmosphere that this game presents. (Despite being on a much older engine; see Graphics) The archaic design of the city walls, long corridors and many, many doors create a much needed level of immersion that is all too uncommon in most horror games. "Okay cool but aren't most horror games like that?" Yes! However this is much more expanded upon than the oh-so-common jumpscare-filled, corridor runners of late. You actually have to explore and figure where the hell you are and where you are supposed to be going. You literally feel lost in a city. IMMERSION.\nMenus aren't anything to gawk over. Simple in design but get the job done. In-game menus(inventory) have more detail and have a nice layout. Nice touches here and there (i.e. limited inventory space, dual wielding, notepad) make the game seem more realistic in a sense. Most items in game have design features that constatly reminds you; This is a horror game and ♥♥♥♥ is about to hit the fan. Simple presentation, yet effective for what the game is trying to accomplish. I find it awesome that this game started off as a mod for Half-life 1 and is now a full standalone product. Go indie developers! Oh yeah and this one has co-op too, so you and a few friends can enjoy the screams together!!! Granted you can get it working...\n9/10\n\nGraphics\nSo this is the area of the game that has received the most criticism, and with fair reasoning. The game itself runs on a modified version of the Half Life 1 Engine. This game however, DOES look SIGNIFICANTLY better than the original HL That being said, its safe to say that this game isn't going to blow anyone away in terms of graphical fidelity. But you know what, I feel the old and outdated engine actually ADDS to the atmosphere of the game. It's lower-end graphics help make me uneasy and uncertain of what to expect. Maybe I am just crazy. Anways, DO NOT let what others say about the graphics dissuade you from trying this game! Graphics are decent enough to keep you immersed and accomplish what the story is trying to tell you. On the plus side, it being an older graphics engine, you can run this game on a huge range of computers. Meaning those Intel Integrated Graphics will finally work well on something! But yes, the graphics are outdated. Still, the model design on the mosters is awesome. Despite the graphics, there are still alot of frightening looking things here to be seen.\n6/10\n\nAudio\n"What the hell is that sound!? WHAT THE F*** is that!"\nAudio in this game is AMAZING considering the small team that put this game together. Water dripping, footsteps, creepy hallway sounds and the soundtrack all go a long way towards constantly keeping you on your toes. Voice acting for the main character is nothing to go crazy over but delivers the message well. Good thing there isn't an over-abundance of it! Most of the games dialouge is delivered through text, indicating a players thought versus actual spoken word. Monsters- Yeah they sound like demonic hellspawns alright. Audio fits very well for each of the monsters I have encountered. Especially those screaming women things. *shudders* Music is good as well. Very atmospheric and certianly adds to the intesity of the game. Just don't expect an original composition by Hans Zimmer.\n8/10\n\nEase of Use\nHere is where I am going to talk a little smack on the game. Now, I realize that there is a wide array of computers in the world, making it hard for developers (especially small ones) to ensure a game works well for EVERYONE. That being said, I spent a good amount of time just getting this game to work past the prologue. Both in its stages as a mod and as a standalone release. Apparently I wasn't the only one having issues running it either. Many crashes and several frustrated hours later, I managed to get the game running stable. (IF YOU ARE RUNNING A 64BIT SYSTEM MAKE SURE YOU GRAB THE PATCH FROM MODdb!!!!! ALSO BE SURE TO CHECK TO FORUMS!!) Once I got it up and running it didnt seem to have any issues. Everything is pretty simply laid out, pretty hard to get confused in the menus. Multiplayer is a little bit different. Seeing as there are no actual servers for this game, you are tasked with creating your own. This can be done several different ways, but is much more of a hassle than just jumping in and browsing a server list. You actually have to know WHO you are playing with and a pretty basic understanding of networking. (Lots of help out there for people who are just geting started with this, check the forums and the web for the multiplayer bit) So, it does have some bugs and hiccups, but if you can get past them and actually get to the game..... IT'S WORTH IT. Past all of that the game is very simple and easy to use.\n7/10\n\nGameplay\nAhh the half life engine feels like a comfortable worn-in boot that you have had for years, and refuse to part with. Gameplay works as expected. Great combat controls (duh, half-life bro) as everything feels extremely responsive and fluid. Yet still challenging enough to keep it interesting. You will most likely die a few times at the hand of some bloodied monster wielding a hammer. Exploration is a pretty big factor here. Constantly having to search your environment for clues as to what you are supposed to be doing or where you are supposed to be going. You don't spend too long looking for that one key or note, or countless hours opening drawers filled with nothing. Everything seems to progress at a good pace.\nNow, I feel this game is packed with scary moments. Sorry I freak out when the door I know to be a loading screen, randomly blows up in my face revealing some deformed monster wanting a tasty bit of my goods. Oh yeah, lots of suprises and scares. But not just jumpscares! Some of this stuff is just straight up creepy...\n10/10\n\n\nVerdict\nCry of fear is a great example of what a small group of developers can do. It takes smooth and familiar gameplay and tosses it straight into a bucket of crazy sauce. It's story driven plot is sure to keep you, and possibly a few others, enganged through it's delights and frights. Despite the outdated graphics and bugs, this is a fantastic game and ranks among the best in the horror genre. Best of all? ITS FREE. Zero paying to play whatsoever. It's the Swedish way.... It's science. Now you have ZERO excuse not to try this game.\n\n8.5/10 Would ♥♥♥♥ again with freinds for free","February 22, 2015","true","3.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The atmosphere on Cry of Fear is perfect! The scares on the game were superb and made me jump out of my seat a couple of times. The puzzles on this game I'll have to say it's good (even though there's only 2 puzzles on this game unless you count the jumping puzzles xD) The weapons on the game are pretty awesome and interesting! I also like how you can't carry everything with you so you'll have to make some tough choices/sacrifices. I definitely recommend this game if you're up to play an awesome, adventurous, and scary as hell horror game!\n(WARNING: This game is not for the Faint hearted) I'll admit when I played this game, some of the jump scares on this game gave me some mini heart attacks! xD","July 13, 2014","true","30.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Sometimes it had me in disbelief, other times it had me scared out of my mind.\nIf you want an exceptional horror game with simple controls and a stellar storyline, but don't have a lot of cash, then I strongly reccommend giving Cry of Fear a try.

(7 if we count both the unlockable character's story mode and the multiplayer one)\n\n-Somewhat curious character.\n\n-You have a unlockable that will let you play in ANOTHER different campaign as a character that helps Simon out in the original story (Don't want to spoil it entirely.)\n\nCons :\n\n-Multiplayer requires port forwarding or LogMeIn Hamachi to play with friends and since the master server list is broke, you will need to open up the console and type in it "connect" (without quotes) and the IP of the server to join it (E.g : connect 190.245.78.75:27015)","May 1, 2013","true","18.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It has the perfect combination of insanely tedious, difficult combat and the never ending sense of danger that really makes you never want to make any progress, and that's what's so stressful, you want to get further in the game, but you would much rather not. This is the perfect game for you traditional survival horror fans out there who enjoy a challenge while having to change your pants a few times and then, directly afterwards, visit your therapist. Oh yeah, and there's not much story, my only real complaint other than some bugs and frequent game crashes.

As someone who is an avid fan of horror games, I checked this game out after seeing good recommendations from other people. What I got from this game was a bit disappointing as I thought I would get more than a few jump scares. It showed a bit of promised during the intro and the first 5 minutes into the game, and I admit it was a little bit nerve racking in the first few minutes into it, but as soon as I got used to the atmosphere, I got bored of it and was craving for more. It didn't live up to my expectation. The enemies are dull and not at all terrifying to the point that I just run around the game hacking and slashing enemies as though I was in a knife fight with a COD player.\n\nHowever, again, this isn't an overall bad game. Maybe I'm just so used to the horror genre that I expected way too much from a free game. People should still check it out because it is still worth checking out.","August 9, 2014","true","0.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I launched it the first time only to run into issues with the way my computer is set up in terms of allowing new programs to run. Took about 5 minutes to clear those up, and launched the game again. Immediately, I was drawn in by the amount of effort put into creating cutscenes that felt like something a big studio would put out and found myself rather intrigued. Then, things took a strange turn. Armed with only a camera, I started to navigate my way through the first area. The darkness made things problematic, I hoped the whole game wouldn't be like this. I kept going, and started feeling comfortable. Surely there was nothing to be afraid of? The other denizens of Steam are not the hardened veterans of horror I thought they were. How wrong I was.\n\nI clicked another little glowing X and what appeared to be a bloody severed head screeched at me as if it's bowels were being extracted with red hot pincers. This had the desired effect, I jumped about a foot in the air, my mouse hand moved wildly as if I had been electrocuted and I muttered "F****n' S**t!" with little regard for anyone who may have been nearby. Thankfully, my pants remained unsoiled and I was alone. It was then that my character woke up. I explored a little after pausing the game for a moment and letting my heart rate settle and found the code to the padlock. I was concerned for my safety, but I boldly pressed onward until I found the first tape recorder. At this point, I saved my game and decided to write up this review warning others about the sheer terror that Cry Of Fear brings.\n\nIn closing, if you're feeling brave give it a try. I know I might never play it again.","July 15, 2015","true","0.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Now remove the ♥♥♥♥ty tank controls and replace them with first-person view and a control scheme more like Half-Life, with the addition of a dodge mechanic allowing you to jump in any direction at a moment's notice.

Instead of an elite police task force in over its head, imagine a young man barely out of high school, all alone, with nothing but a pocket knife and a cell phone with no signal.\n\nWelcome to Cry of Fear.\n\nThe game is a blend of FPS combat mixed with borderline point-&-click puzzles, with each new building or area of the city necessitating some puzzle to be solved, some item to be tracked down, all while trying to survive the wide variety of things trying to kill you. The story is actually interesting, and I found myself pleasantly surprised as I neared the end, and the desire to play it over for a fresh perspective was aided by the myriad of challenges you can complete for NG+ gear to aid in your survival, as well as community made mini-campaigns for a breath of fresh air.\n\n\nPositives:\n+Challenging gameplay\n+Oppressive, unnerving, and eerie level design\n+Interesting story\n+Good replay value\n+Alternate co-op campaign\n+Good length SP campaign\n\nNegatives:\n-Dated graphics (Negligible unless your name is Totalbiscuit)\n-Sub-par VA work can really take you out of it\n-Needs an extra patch to work with 64-bit systems","December 10, 2014","true","2.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
