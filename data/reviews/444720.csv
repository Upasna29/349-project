Its garbage. Seriously. The movement is just gross feeling, the targeting and AI movement is just way off. Its a good....first try i guess, but as a first try i think it should of started on New grounds or something.\n\nThere is also ZERO story. The moves you pick up have zero to do with combat or beating bosses or anything.  The dodge move is Cute. Its works half the time. The other half is because you are in a small pathway the size of the Character.\nI got up to the Ice Area and was just done with it.\n\nI tried and didn't like the feeling of it. I am a Die hard Metrovania fan. Good luck on your next game.","April 18","false","1.1"," 101 of 144 people (70%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","70","101","144","3","15"

There are less than half a dozen boss fights in the entire game and roughly 15 different enemy types, including palette swaps. The only magic spell in the game consists of shooting out a single underwhelming blue bullet in a straight line and acquiring new weapons does not change your attack pattern nor, to the best of my knowledge, the appearance of your weapon. You can perform a double slash by pressing the attack button at the right moment, but that's the full extent of your melee capabilities. There's a backflip, but it doesn't grant invincibility frames and you'll get knocked out of it if the ceiling is too low so it's often better to just slash away at enemies to kill them before they can attack in the first place. What little plot there is could use a better English translation and has a conclusion which is both disappointing and unearned. The actual length of the game is also ridiculously short; it took me well under two hours to finish the game and that was with collecting every single piece of gear and getting all 7 hidden jigsaw pieces without the use of a guide.\n\nBalance and level design are also major issues here. Nearly every part of the game consists of a series of bland, horizontal corridors with no gimmicks, no traps, or anything else other than a handful of monsters sprinkled about. The few bits of platforming which exist tend to be trivial and, to be blunt, extremely bland. As to balance, you gain two stat points every level and I found that putting all of them into strength trivialized nearly every enemy and boss in the game. Gold is also unbalanced as enemies and random blocks often give 1 or 10 gold pieces, but several chests exist which give 1000 each; before even reaching the halfway point of the game I had purchased every single item in the shop, including the best armor in the game. The handful of abilities you gain are also acquired relatively early on and even the best weapon is easily acquired near the start of the game's second half, leaving the remaining 30-45 minutes of this 90 minute experience as a bland key-collecting slog as you slaughter your way through the castle.\n\nAs far as first games go, I've certainly seen worse, but I absolutely cannot recommend spending money on this. There is far too little here and what is here consists almost entirely of bland level design, overly simplistic gameplay, and unbalanced progression. I did not attempt Hard Mode, but nothing about my initial playthrough gave me any desire to do so.","April 25","false","1.5"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","15","18","0","0"

I would like for some of the enemies to really telegraph their attacks a little better, to give time for me to react. There is a plant in the first stage whose tell is a 2x2 square mouth opening before launching a large fireball.  The tell doesn't quite fit the attack in this case.  However, in the cave stage, there is a deer that rears his head full back before launching an attack - that's perfect.\n\nDespite my nitpicking the art side of things, the platforming is quite good, the controls are responsive (I'm using the suggested Xbox 360 gamepad) and I do like the basic premise of the game. I shall continue to play after posting this first impression, and then I'll get back with more feedback later.\n\nFirst Edit - 49 minutes of gameplay:\n\nI stand by my statements about the solid platforming, though I have to admit that the art and animations get both better and worse.  I feel that the enemies of the castle stage (which would be about stage 5 by my own numbering system) don't seem to fit with the art direction of the rest of the game and seem to come from a different artist altogether.  It's not exactly bad, as the animations are much better than the earliest enemies in nearly all respects.\n\nI've fought three or four bosses now, and I can say that the fights are decent, though I won't lie and say they were all that challenging.  I just beat the boss guarding skill #4, and I found that fight to be quite fun, so we'll see if the future fights improve.\n\nI might take this moment to talk a little bit about the UI and such - the localization is not perfect.  Achievement popups come in French, one of the main menu options is still in French, there are a few English typos, and the translation isn't perfect.  It's completely readable, and doesn't really ruin the game in any way, but there are people out there who can't stand any sort of localization errors, so I thought I would mention it.\n\nFor some reason, right at the beginning of Stage 2, you'll meet Sahasrahla, who is taking a break from helping out Link and helps out our friend Hald in this game, bringing with him a shop.  Not a huge deal, a little weird, but Sahasrahla sold me Excalibur, and wants golden puzzle pieces. How did the sage from the Legend of Zelda get Excalibur, and why does he want Banjo Kazooie's Puzzle Pieces?  I don't know.  I didn't ask.\n\nStill, a solid game overall.  I've been having fun.  I am a little worried that I'm coming to the end of it, though.  Next update should be a complete run.\n\nProbable Final Edit: Main storyline finished. (2.1 Hours)\n\nSo I just finished the main plot of the game, and while I did leave a few things behind, I ran through the levels multiple times trying to locate them, and eventually just couldn't be bothered to keep running them.  That's not to say that I didn't enjoy the game at all, but folks who know me (or can simply observe my profile) know that I'm not much of a completionist, don't really care about achievements, and do not often repeat games or levels.\n\nI kinda wanted to find the puzzle pieces, but I left 2 of them behind somewhere.  Perhaps I'll load up my save at some point and figure it out, but meh, I had my fun.\n\nAll in all, I really think it was totally worth the $6 USD price of admission, and I liked it.  Here's a quick rundown for the TL;DR crowd:\n\nPros:\nSolid platforming\nDoesn't wear out its welcome\nGood mechanics and balance\nFunny little Nintendo nods\nInteresting premise, if not entirely fleshed out.\n\nCons:\nImperfect localization means some clumsy grammar and typos\nSome animations are a little stiff\nSome art doesn't quite "fit"\nKinda short\n\nI'd give the game a 7/10 and say that fans of the genre will enjoy it, but it's probably not everyone's cup of tea.","February 17","true","2.1"," 54 of 93 people (58%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","58","54","93","2","2"

It is no terribly long or complex, but it gets the point along in the amount of time it offers. I played with a controller, and those controls worked well; an important part of these games. I played my first and only run on hard mode, and it was difficult at times, but not controller breakingly so.\n\nThe most glaring flaw I found, was that enemy hit boxes, especially larger ones, are not always obvious. When trying to hit an enemy, you will be either missing or running into the enemy by mistake. Like all things, we learn as we do, but the weapon's reach could stand to be a tad longer to allow for hitbox forgiveness.\n\nFun game, decent price.","April 20","true","3.2"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","0"

In the begining you will find a hints what help you to learn the controls. The controls in a first minutes if you play with keyboard can be difficult. Your goal here reach a dark astle and defeat the bad guy to broke a spells what he used on your sister.  In your way you will find different enemies and traps too. After all enemies has been killed you will earn XP points and grab a coins. Coins you can spend in a shop to buy some things. When you earned enough XP points you earn a next level and some points what you can spent to upgrade your stats. Also you have some special skills, they will be unlocked at specific part of levels when you defeated a boss, etc.\nThe game graphic is retro style, inspired by 16- bit era, but looks nice. Music and the sounds also well fit to the game.\n\nSo my verdict\n\n+ steam cards and achievements\n+ nice music and sound\n+ nice retro style\n+ well balanced difficulty levels\n\n- short\n- some bugs\n- if you are play with keyboard need some time to get used\n\nWell, i think this game is really enjoyable, if you are like this that kind of games and like a retro style this game is for you even though you can complete it less than 2 hour, but if you want get all achievements, you should play it even more. This game also have some bugs at moment, they will be fixed i think in next update. The price for game is i think absolutely worth, for you money you will get some hours enjoyable playtime, nice music and nice retro style graphic.\n","April 1","true","5.6"," 19 of 42 people (45%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","45","19","42","3","0"

Does it pull it off? Well, maybe.\n\nIt's difficult to compare this game to such a masterpiece without either setting expectations unreasonably high or completely smashing them to bits. Why I feel compelled to do so is because the controls so faithfully emulate the feel of that game it would be hard for someone not to notice it who's played it before. Controls are, in my opinion, one of the hardest things to get right. They can easily feel too floaty, clunky, or just plain off, but Inexistence gets it just right.\n\nWith the game's limited skill set, the controls are also restricted to mostly your basic moves, but this is pretty much the theme of the game. While all of your basic elements are there, skills, equipment, currency and experience points, they come in very small quantities. There are, for instance, only 4 swords in the game, and approximately the same amount of power-up skills.\n\nThe soundtrack is less than memorable and the artwork, while charming in its originality, can feel strangely out of place or mismatched, especially with the oddly frequent video game references.\n\nThe game is quite short; I have nearly 100%'d it in just under 3 hours. What I will say is that these were enjoyable hours for a veteran of the genre, and for the asking price are probably worth it.\n\nWhile I do think someone new to the genre would be better suited starting with one of the staple titles, someone looking for more of the same is likely to find exactly that, in a reasonably priced, small bundle.","April 19","true","4.3"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

The level design is also boring in some areas (oh my god the library at the end is DULL). There just isn't enough of everything. Not enough enemies, not enough skills, not enough equipment... this is both a good and a bad thing. It's bad because I want more, but it's good because I WANT MORE!\n\nGiven how solid the rest of the game is, I'd love to see something bigger and more ambitious from the dev. Hopefully the money I spent on this will go towards an even better game!\n\nNote to the dev: You forgot to translate Soeur's during the ending. Probably confusing for other players who don't know French! :D","April 12","true","3.5"," 0 of 7 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","7","0","0"

I can't say I would be the person to due more than two playthroughs.  As my play time say, 3.4 hours give or take.\n\nI really like the simple graphics, the story is surpisingly good for being simple and the ending is so sad, but fitting for how everything happened.\n\nThere are a few minor things I noticed, one which I'm going to assume as a bit of memory leaking in one area (it has a bunch of flying heads, so maybe it isn't).\n\nThen is some challenges with combat being very simple, they reconmend a controller and only use four of the...many buttons inputs, outside of the joystick, which might as well be a dirrectional pad.\n\nI couldn't really tell what each stat did, (strength is damage, defense is decrease amount of damage taken, health is health, but the others are...well, magic...more magic damage?)  I could guess them, but there is something missing.\n\nOutside of that, its fine.\n\nstory time,\n\nEverything starts and ends with a fairly interesting idea, "Wake up, can you here me...?"  I'll admit, I thought I might find something amazing from the entire story, but it really ended up with a few conversations between the hero (Hald) and the villian (Claos).  When the final came I was quickly saying, ok this is too easy, but after I see some trouble with the next part, but its kind of easy.  Then at the end it all ends and as Claos says, this is all a illusion and without spoiling anything, the "hero" wakes up.  I can see a really painful truth to what is happening and I can't help, but cry.  (If you really want to know, beat the game already, really there is a achievement for 1:30 full playthrough time, come on!  Even the price is low.)  After seeing the credits I really have to wonder what is going on with the maker, did something like this happen to him at one point or was it something else?  Either way, play the game, its good even without the story.\n\nMy biggest complaint, just how sort the game was.  There isn't much replay value, but for what's there its worth the price tag.  I'm almost disapointed with game titles that say, metriodvania and turn out to be really small.  I normally think of metriodvania as something simalar to the origonal metriod games, if not castlevania, which again had the simlar style.  Long, branching paths the require you to go back once you got some form of upgrade.\n\nOver all, I'll give a 8/10 ... Size is always a plus, but for how much is here this is worth the price.  I say this is a great little game and I'm a little disapointed I missed it until now.","April 18","true","4.0"," 0 of 7 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","7","0","0"

Standard platformer with options for gamepad and bindable mouse+keyboard\nHere is the first part on my playthrough that I have uploaded to youtube:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK_yTpQV6V8&feature=youtu.be\n\nPros:\nI will most likely finish the game today as I am having a lot of fun.  Funny typos and grammar mistakes.  Gameplay is easy and fluid with great music.  Sound is good.  Environments are nice and varied.  RPG elements allow for some customization but you most likely invest in hard damage.\n\nCons:\nGame seems short with little to no replay value.  Will update if necessary.  At a certain point enemies become very easy and some boss fights are laughable.  Legitamate amount of backtracking will no doubt be annoying as well.\n\nOveral great game though for the price.  Better than COD","February 17","true","5.8"," 4 of 16 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","4","16","0","0"

The ending can be a little confusing for some, but honestly the game really stands on its own despite it. (Love the little nod at the final battle to another very famous Matroidvania battle ;)...hehe)\n\nI bought this full price (6.49 CAD) and felt I got my money's worth. Attentive developer as well...I had my save game listed at 98% and posted about it on the forum, wondering what I had missed. Dev stated it was a bug and they fixed it. Sure enough when I updated my game, the save was at 100%. Excellent dev!\n\nBuy this game.

It took me 8 hours to beat and I was really taking my time and relaxing as I played through it.\n\n\n\nSPOILER WARNING:\n\n\n\n\nSPOILER WARNING\n\n\n\n\nSPOILER WARNING\n\n\n\nThe ending is really depressing and may trigger a VERY unexpected and unpleasant reaction from people who have suffered (or, specifically, watched somebody suffer) a certain kind of abuse.  I can't decide whether it was a lowbrown attempt at shock or a clever stroke; it DOES make you view the entire game into a very different perspective, and suddenly many of what seemed to be childish dialogue and plot devices become much deeper.","March 11","true","9.0"," 0 of 8 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","8","0","0"
