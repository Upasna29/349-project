But what is at the heart of every game like this, combat.  Now I will say, combat in itself is just as well done as the rest of the game.  However, someone on the dev team needs to understand the importance of mob spawning and placement. For me this is where the game literally falls apart.   there is almost no space to manuver in this game as it is, then add the mob spawn logic.  Take two steps and mobs spawn in around you in a circle and attack, This is a game where tactics do not exist, its simplhy a matter of stepping forward, getting encircled with spiders, taking boat loads of un dodgeable damange and spamming pots, lots and lots of pots.\n\nI find in annoying enough to stop playing even though the rest of the game is literallh a masterpiece.  All I can ask is that as you redesign and update your game for the re-release, try to create a more fluid combat dance between the player and the mobs.  Dont rely on cheap spawning tactics to create articfically difficulty.\n\nThere is also an abundency of console type boss fights, tiny little rooms, no where to move, lighting fast bosses that do tons of damage.  There is no pacing to these events they are just pot swigging marathons, or as suggested in the loading tips, over level your character and go back to fight bosses.\n\nUnfortunantely I will have to give this game a thumbs down.  I am the owner of just about every top down Diable style game available on steams, literally dozens and there is somthing magical about a game when they can get mob spawning, combat fighting spaces, mob and player speeds, functional CC down riight.  I just dont think this game has that criticall component.  What a shame.","November 12, 2015","false","8.1"," 154 of 183 people (84%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","84","154","183","10","7"

ARPGs very rarely have a captivating story but I found Shadows: Heretic Kingdoms to be an exception, that's not to say it's as good a story as found in story-driven games, but it does it's job well and draws you in. Add in exceptional voice acting and great aesthetics and you have a game with a lot of good components working together. I found myself quite immersed with this game and had more urge to play through this game start to finish than any other ARPG since the Mass Effect trilogy.\n\nThat's not to say this game is flawless, it does have it's problems but I found that the pros far outweighed the cons. I had some crashing issues on a single map, I found the developers use of foreshadowing was a bit heavy-handed at times, and the game started off a bit slow due to the nature of how combat works. The game does start out with a fair amount of story telling,  but once you get through that you are left to delve into the combat with a fledgling group.\n\nCombat revolves around the demon you play, who can bind the souls of deceased beings, making them a part  of your party. At the beginning of the game you have just the demon and the main hero in your "party." You only control one party member at a time, but each party member is unique and brings something different to the table, this is a very interesting dynamic that makes combat a lot of fun...when you actually have a full party to choose from. Fortunately after a few hours of play you should have a full team and from there on out combat is generally well paced and far more fun to play. There is a party limit of four, but you can always travel to your home base and change the roster. During combat you can switch to any of the active party members. I found this to add a lot to the combat, you can change the unit you are playing on based on situational factors and also rotate characters based on their spells cooldowns. I thoroughly enjoyed the combat once I had a full party. Individual spells might not  be the most exciting but the fact you can switch characters at any point more than makes up for it.\n\nAll in all, I really enjoyed the experience in Book 1. I was definitely eating this game up and was only putting it down to play co-op games with friends. The story was a lot of fun to follow throughout and I enjoyed going through most of the dialog, I didn't even skip over the voice acting by and large (just about all dialog is accompanied by voice acting). The combat was equally enjoyable once I got into the core of the game. Add the two elements together along with everything else the game does great and you have the exceptional game that is Shadows: Heretic Kingdoms (Book I). I'm definitely keeping my fingers crossed that Book II sees the light of day, it would be a shame for the series die after such a strong start.\n\nP.S. The game has an awesome orchestral soundtrack, here is a sample: https://youtu.be/IeTPR0teXZw","April 10, 2015","true","17.5"," 89 of 97 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","89","97","0","2"

This may be a product of not playing the game enough but in most games I play, by 4 hours you usually know where the game is going.\n\nSo this is what I know so far and what I believe people will find useful if they are looking at buying this game. I bought this game because I wanted to try another arpg that marketed itself as being different from the usual model. This game does that. It is story driven and has characters that very much have their own flare and personalities. The voice acting is very good and the dialogue always feels important and interesting.  However, I feel that even a story driven game should have fun and interesting combat, or at least cool combat animations. In this game I never found myself saying "Holy (explicative) that was awesome" or "This move is fricking amazing". Instead I found myself mumbling "ok, this a stun/aoe" and "Im not sure why I even picked up this second skill". I tried using both the archer and the barbarian and although the archer seemed a little bit more versatile, the abilities used still seemed lack luster. And maybe this was by design in an effort to make a more grounded game. But in my defense I bought a game where you play as a soul devouring demon who controls/ binds with souls of fallen heroes, and that just sounded a lot more awesome than it turned out to be combat wise. Im choosing to leave out anything dealing with bugs and technical issues because the developers do seem to care whether or not the game runs well and have taken the time to roll out a few updates. For that reason I wont judge the game based on how many times it crashes. But I will say this, when a game comes out of early access, beta, or whatever testing phases it uses and is marketed as a finished game, it should be finished. It shouldn't be released with known crashes or unfinished graphical features (like  vsync). With that said the game is under 35 and should get a little slack for technical issues. For me personally it's the combat that kills this game. I plan on finishing the game after the crashes get fixed because I spent money on the game and because it does have a really interesting story line. But if I had known now what it plays like then I woulnt have spent more than $10 on it.\n\nSo in conclusion, if you dont care too much about combat or gameplay and mostly judge games based on story and concepts, then this is a game you will love. However if you are like me and want a visceral combat experience where you can feel progression at every skill point, then you will be underwhelmed by this game. As a general piece of advice, give this game another month or so to iron out tech issues. This will be a good game for some and a poor game for others, unfortunately for this reviewer it just wasn't up to snuff. The only reason I chose "No" is because I had to choose something and I wouldn't tell my friends that this is a must have. If you need a number this is a 60/100 and thats assuming tech issues get resolved.

I can't say it's the most original feeling experience as it is basically a "Diablo clone" (as much as I hate to use that term), but it does enough of its own thing to warrant my time, I think. Besides, if you're going to go for a style of game play, you could do a whole hell of a lot worse than iterating on solid design to begin with.\n\nPLEASE REMEMBER THIS IS AN EARLY ACCESS GAME! If you're wanting to try this game to see what it's about, maybe watch a YouTube video or something first as I can't recommend the game for $26.99 as is. That being said, if you're like me and are able to look past some major game flaws with an open mind while being a fan of the genre, this isn't the worst purchase on Steam.\n\nAs is, I would recommend having a decent rig for playing, since there are currently no options to "tune down" any of the graphic settings beside resolution to work well for lower end machines and even on my high-mid machine it chugs like a beast due to lack of optimization (that will surely come much later). I streamed my first impressions of the game and I feel like that was a mistake and may have made the game look much more choppy than it actually was, but I feel like the most I got at any point in time playing was 25-30fps. It isn't unplayable, but added to the sluggish movement feel and kinda janky item pickup, some parts felt more arduous than they will when I can tweak the settings to make sure I get my full 60fps minimum.\n\nTL;DR Don't be silly and think you'll get an objectively "good" product right now for the price, but there is enough in here to show glimpses of a future solid title.\n\nP.S. Shameless video play plug and to the devs, I'm sorry my streaming made the game look like it performs worse than it actually does :-(\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HblXseaXGzs\n","June 13, 2014","true","17.0"," 110 of 143 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","110","143","0","2"

There’s actually locked doors and three quests in part 1 that can only be opened in the retail edition. It’s not available on the steam version, even to earliest of the early adaptors like myself. And there's nothing in the game to tell you this, so expect to waste time backtracking because you don't know which bits you were supposed to come back to with your new shiny, and which bits were never meant for you at all.\n\nChapter 1 is great. There’s a good mixture of combat and plot. Chapters 2 & 3 and the other hand is just combat. The combat’s not bad, but that’s really all there is to Chapters 2 & 3 so if you looking for something other than grind, stay away.\n\nI played through to the end, but wished I hadn’t bothered.\n\nPros:\nExcellent art design. Each level is both pretty and functional. The ability to switch to a ‘ghost world’ gets twice the millage out of each level without it feeling tired or forced.\nThe ability to switch between characters is quite cool and well implemented. All characters receive XP whether they are in the party or not, so there’s no penalty for trying one out. The characters each have a distinct feel even though they all fall into one of three classes (ranged, magic, melee).\nBosses are varied and feel special.\nIn the configuration settings, you can change the ‘highlight loot/interactive area’ key from push-and-hold to toggle-on-and-off.\nTom Baker voice over.\n[b[Cons:[/b]\nThere are no movement keys. It’s right click to move, left click to attack. This makes most combat stationary and a battle of health bars rather than something dynamic and exciting. There is some ability to kite by switching between ghost and meat characters (and you’ll be doing that a lot in chapter 3).\nSome of the later levels have you backtracking across multiple levels without fast travel no apparent reason.\nThe game engine does not support multiple CPUs or GPUs (source: dev posting in the comments). My 4 core, GTX 970 SLI config could barely manage 40FPS on max settings.\nMob difficulty level is all over the place, typically at the start of a new chapter.\nSkill are unbalanced.","November 25, 2014","false","31.9"," 100 of 131 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","100","131","0","0"

Most games can't take the amount of Alt+Tab that I throw at them but this one did. :)"\n\nEDIT: this getting stuck has not happened in a long time.\n"The most annoyng technical issue I ran into is related to collision when the character gets stuck on a level difference, and that usually happens when there are 7 enemies around him."\n\n\nEDIT: the  con mentioned on the next row  has been solved and combat is now more spectaluar and you can see clearly who you hit (can be seen in episodes 16+ of the series I linked below)\n\n"The combat could be a little more spectacular, and by that I mean, a few more clues of who your abilities hit when you use them." <-not valid anymore as of 03.dec.14\n\nEDIT2: the below mentioned con has been addressed in the patch from 04.dec so now all enemies are manageable.\n"EDIT: but I can add a new con and that is about game balance. Some enemies are to tough, some are not tough enough and some characters get loads of good gear, and others you spend 6 levels with the same thing.  I know that in this game, stats don't scale like in other arpg's but still it is a little annoying. "\n\nPros\n\nEDIT:  there have been 3-4 patches since launch and they have fixed almost everything that I had a problem with. I really like that they moved pretty fast on issues that mattered and not just promises. I also like they interact with the players here in the Steam Community forums and are open minded about stuff. (I don't have any relation with the developers, I just find them to be some of the cooler people in the business about how they handle stuff)\n\nThis game has a nice story, interesting characters and awesome voice acting.\n\nThe developers are invested in making the game awesome, and the progression the game has seen in the last 6 months is really impressive, so I have very high hopes, they will fix all the annoying stuff. :)\n\nI find combat to be more satisfying than that of other arpg's because you need to employ tactics when fighting enemies, not just spam Blizzard of Fire :) (I have hundreds of hours of D3 but sometimes it annoys the hell out of me :))\n\nI have made a playthrough series with the hunter/archer and there you can see the tactics I talk about. Once you get past the first chapter, (on normal mode) you will need to synergize your abilities if you want to be able to kill the enemies efficiently. For efficent killing speed, you'll need to use your puppets in synergy. Also you'll need to synergize your Devourer and your Puppets since some enemies need both to be killed.(you can see this in episode 8 of my series if you want)\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5M3T6ArHoE\n\n\nEDIT: If you feel that my review is solely to boost my videos, please do not visit them, but go and find gameplay footage on youtube from other people. There is plenty to choose from. I wrote this review because I love this game, how it progressed and how it is still progressing.\n\nEdit:\n\nIf you want to see why I am optimistic about this game take a look at how the game was 6 months ago compared to how it is now and you'll see the progress I am talking about.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7ADizNWHe8","November 25, 2014","true","30.2"," 135 of 201 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","135","201","2","0"

My apologies for that.\n\nShadows: Heretic Kingdoms is one of the most interesting games I've ever played. The gameplay is similar to that of Diablo 3, in that you have the same camera perspective and you basically spam your abilities to kill enemies. However, this game does it with a simple twist, the ability to move between two realms at will.\n\nWhat this simple mechanic does, is that you actually need to think whenever you're fighting against a group of enemies, as some of them are exclusive to one of either realms. I thoroughly enjoyed battling a boss, and using this to my advantage.\n\nThe story of the game has been pretty good so far, and the characters that you control are quite interesting. The fact that your characters have their very own story adds a huge amount of replayability to the game which is really nice.\n\nDespite all the good points though, some players may not enjoy the game that much due to the rather slow progression in stats and power, I haven't had any trouble with enemies on normal mode yet, but you don't feel very powerful either, since you'll die quickly if you stay within the range of your enemies' attacks. Do take note that I play a ranged character, it is possible that melee characters do not suffer from this issue.\n\nI personally believe that the slow progression is kind of nice. It really is a great feeling when you finally level up, like you really accomplished something. And usually you do notice a change in power due to the scaling as you invest skill points into skills or passives.\n\nGraphics-wise the game is absolutely gorgeous, particle effects in combat are not over the top and flow nicely. The environmental art within the game is great too. Alongside the music and narrative it really immerses yourself within the game.\n\nOne should most definitely buy this game if they enjoy a good story with a large amount of side-quests and simple, yet mechanically interesting combat.\n\nTL;DR\nIf you would enjoy a game with a fair amount of exploration and story.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SamuraiVader/recommended/256030/","SamuraiVader","Samurai Vader","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SamuraiVader/","4009 products in account","Shadows: Heretic Kingdoms is a hack'n'slash RPG with a great story idea - you play the role of The Devourer who, as his name suggests, devours the souls of heroes. But this way, he also gives them a new life! In the end, this leads you to ability to switch between The Devourer and any of his collected hero souls. From beginning, you start with only one picked hero but as you go through the game, you'll find more characters - every character coming with its unique skillset. But don't get too much hyped about tactical group management, you can play only one character at time.\n\nWhole graphic style feels pleasant in terms of the genre (and competitors as Diablo III), the atmosphere is good thanks to nice soundtrack and well-made voice acting, though it depends on specific characters - for example the princess (mage beginning character) was sometimes cringeworthy like Obara Sand from Game of Thrones.\n\nEvery environment has two version - the real one (for living characters) and the spiritual one (for The Devourer). This split is a nice idea and it's well implemented in the game, as you can swap between characters to get into/from spiritual world to run out of big group of enemies - only elite minions and bosses are in both environments.\n\nInterface and the game controls are something that feels totally unoriginal. I think the developers might have wanted to be more close to casual and current generation of (MOBA) players, so the interface and control keybindings are similar to League of Legends (or Dota 2). As a huge hack'n'slash RPG fan since the first Diablo, this felt really bad to me, seeing even small details, as the health regeneration counter in the health bar, made my impression pretty much worse.\n\nAnother terrible thing is the AI of enemies. Many of aggressive minions won't attack you even if you are next to them, until you attack them. Enemy mobs also don't have much idea about pathfinding and walls, so if they can attack from range, they'll try to shoot you even through the wall. And they will fail.\n\nWhat is almost a must feature in RPGs to have as a resource besides health? There should be something, right? Mana (magicka), rage, whatever you may think of but there's nothing! All character skills are only cooldown-driven (run and spam skills while you can), the blue resource you can see in screenshots is "soul essence" that is used by The Devourer to ressurect dead characters.\n\nBesides mentioned cons there are also some smaller bugs like missing item icons or bugged achievements (couldn't unlock achievement for getting characters to level 2). Also, it's good to warn you that there's no autosave! That means, if you die, you have to load your latest manual save, in good old style. If you are too much spoilt by today's games, you might accidentally lose some of your playtime if you die and forget to save your position sometimes before.\n\nOverall, I understand why Shadows: Heretic Kingdoms gets many positive responses, though I felt more like I was playing a fan-made custom campaign for already existing game (and I believe it's a lot because of the interface and controls, it does not fit the game). It's not bad and it might be worth getting on sale but otherwise I'd rather recommend you checking for some other ARPG.\n\n\nFor more reviews, join Samurai Vader's Point of View group and follow my curator page, I'm always happy to see feedback about my reviews.","January 23","false","1.9"," 40 of 58 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","40","58","0","1"

So far I have beat this game with the merchant king and now I am working on the enchantress. this is obviously a beta version of the game but is well worth the money upfront. There are some minor improvements to the mechanics of the game but everything else is outstanding especially the graphics and effects especially for a non main stream or popular name like Blizzard.\n\nCon's:\n\nThe mechanical issues I have quams with are as follows:\n\n#1. When holding down your left mouse button to walk automatically if your mouse cursor by chance hits a destroyable object (which happens every friggen single time!!) will cause the character to pause and shoot or melee that target......this is a major "no, no"\n\n#2. Spontaneous game crashes. Luckily every time the game crashed I had saved my progress at major points of the game before the incent but still cost me many wasted minutes. This is also a major "no no"!!!.\n\n#3. Unlike games like diablo 3 when you press your button to attack a target then quickly press the button again to attack a different target in the middle of your attack and executes instantly to attack the other target after hitting the original target. This game has characters that execute 10x slower than the characters in Diablo so when you predetermine your target then change targets in the middle of your execution your character pauses and does not execute the original target then restarts the movement to attack the new target........This is super annoying for D3 players like myself but this setting is much more realistic so if you appreciate the realism vs the unrealistic stuff like D3 then this game is for you.\n\nPro's:\n#1: The Price of the game is low for this quality of a game.\n\n#2. The music & the character voices/material is great.\n\n#3. The graphics are very detailed and realistic.\n\n#4. The gameplay and story line is very unique in it's genre.\n\n#5. This game has great potential.\n\n\n","January 9, 2015","true","30.2"," 19 of 22 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","19","22","0","0"

I bought this while bored and was very suprised by how much i liked it.  It is a very well done game.  Clearing every area twice isn't so bad.  I like my demon and my main guy so far, I enjoy the charcater building and there being no resets of skill points requiring thought.\n\nCombat is fast and slow, with almost limitless heals and sometimes extremem damage spikes to help with the mechanics.  It has just the right challenge level and combat is very well done considering you have potions, 3 alive people to cycle through, the demon, and your soul bar heals and reserrects.\n\nThe game has a pretty decent crafting system.  The rpg aspects of quests and npc interactions are actually very heavy for an ARPG and plays like a real crpg.  Production value is high and the voice overs are actually really good for the demon, my fighter character, and the others I've heard.\n\nI am happy i bought this game, even at the current full price of $20.  I just bought the orginal and am going to play that through now and then come back to this.  I skipped almost all arpgs back in the day like this and sacred, etc, but am now learning to appreciate the heavier ones like Divine Divinity.\n\nFor some reason this game, S:HK reminds me of Lionheart.  It isn't very similar but it has repetetive combat that somehow doesn't bother me.  This is a different sort of game than the ones I usually go for so is hard for me to recommend it to people who usually play crpgs, but I think most crpg fans will find this to be a good game whereas Torchlight, Diablo 3 type arpg fans may think it is to crpgish and slow.","November 23, 2015","true","20.7"," 22 of 29 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","22","29","0","0"

A lot of good things going for it: engaging gameplay, rich in lore and story, challenging and needing to keep your wits about you (no steamrolling through areas in this one, folks). The environments look pretty, and even though isometric in view, the depth of the levels makes it work in a very nice balance. Enemies will chase you - just walking a screen away soesn't make them forget about you - and you have to keep in mind not to stumble deeper into enemy territory or it will be game over.\n\nThe switching between characters is unique in this game, and makes for rather interesting challenges. You have to be adaptive depending on where you are and what you want to do. You can develop the characters at your disposal individually, making it possible to have completely different play-throughs. That means a lot, a LOT of replay value in this one just from that, not even counting the completely different story lines from when you make your first choice of champion.\n\nA few downsides I found that could use some work: using the mouse, in fights, the targeting is sometimes really off, making you move to or attack unwanted targets when you're just trying to get away from what's chasing you. Another issue I found is that the challenge level of the game goes up rather steeply in some areas, making it difficult to progress.\n\nOtherwise, I strongly recommend this game - and I do hope the developers will continue writing more of the story in next "books" in the same vein.","February 25, 2015","true","41.8"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","16","19","0","0"

I'm one of the half dozen or so people who purchased the classic ARPG Heretic Kingdoms at release and enjoyed it quite a bit, so I was excited for this somewhat belated semi-sequel (same world, different characters). It really delivers.\n\nIt has all the appeal of the original and its bizarre, dark anti-theistic world of the Heretic Kingdoms setting as well as great art design and graphics, rock solid controls and an interesting combat mechanic whereby you can change to a different character/form on the fly. Each form has different strengths and weaknesses and multiple ones are frequently viable in a given area. Bosses are fun, enemies are challenging without being overly difficult and all-in-all this is just a great game.\n\nJust an FYI, this game series is single-player and campaign oriented and plays more like the Dungeon Siege or Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance than the more loot-driven, frequently multi-player oriented games like the Diablo series or Titan Quest.\n\nAdditionally, Book 2 has not been released.

You end up pretty often hitting nothing but Air, if you get swarmed by multiple Enemies at once. Also, it seems that quite often you just hang, and then you end up dying, because your Character decided to do nothing.\n\nRunning: While that System is nothing you should think its buggy, it is still buggy. Because you find yourself a few Times just getting stuck on Things .. and yes, you can even get stuck into NOTHING. Then you just cant move anymore, no back or forth.\n\nContent: Here comes my biggest complain. The Steam Version of the Game is incomplete. When you finally end up killing the "End-Boss", you find yourself with a few unfinished Quests that lead into nothing. There are several locked Doors/Gates that you cant open. Missing Boss in the Steam Version. On the other Hand, if you have the Retail Version of this Game, all those Quests are doable, and you can open the Gates/Doors.\n\nCrashes: You experience random and non-random Crashes all over the World. There are several Hotspots in the World, where the Game just crash, and it does this every time you get close to this Point. And the Random Crashes happen also, all the Time. So you can repeat or walk over the Map all over again, just to end up having another Crash.\n\n\nAs of now: Dont buy this Game, at least not on Steam, if you want the Full Experience of the Game.\n\nAdditional Information: For Achievement-Hunters - DO NOT BUY.

Kinda slow paced hack-and-slash which is refreshing after the Diablo's and Torchlights of this world. You also play as 2 characters, one Deamon and the character it has ressurected which is an interesting twist to the good old party system. Switching characters changes the surroundigs to an alternate world or the 'real' world, each with it's own enemies and physics. You can use your souls to ressurrect your character if it dies, which is quite fun mechanic. You lose health quite easily, and if you are near dead you hear your heartbeat go faster and faster until you die and are ressurected again. So dying isn't a big problem which is kinda cool.\n\nGraphics are good, sound is excellent and animations are fine.

There are tons of good ideas here, as well as old classic ones, all great reasons to buy and enjoy this game. I'll list a few of them below.\n\nFirst of all, this game is a classic call back to titles like the original Diablo, Ultima, Might and Magic and Golden Axe. I say that because the plot, characters, items and abilities are reminiscent of a simpler formula for what made roleplaying games fun: Genuinely mysterious plots, needing to pick through lots of containers, trying to find ways through locked doors, tons of areas to explore and re-explore, life-threatening bosses, and cool new upgrades in each place you visit - All tropes we're familiar with, and elements we've largely taken for granted in today's world of grindy hyper-fantasy turbo-speed action games.\n\nTo talk about the new, the first thing you'll notice is that the pacing in combat is intentionally slower than most modern games because you actually have tons of different things you can do at any given time. The primary gimmick is that you can switch between characters at will but only play one at a time, which has a great justification in the game, which also justifies the manner in which you heal your party, the purposing behind which is very well thought out and works very well. The game opens up and starts throwing lots more monsters and compromising situations at you as you acquire new abilities and party members, which you will begin to switch between often. Once you start to learn the combos you can do and the pace at which you can do them, strategies for dealing with different kinds of badguys become endless and the gameplay becomes very rewarding.\n\nAdd on top of this that the voice acting and plot is excellent despite having been developed in Europe and the color and environments are nothing short of beautiful, and you will spend a lot of time enjoying this game. The only complaints here are that the game starts off maybe a little too slow, and there isn't enough to do as far as playing the first character you start out as for the first hour or two. After hour two, the game becomes much more interesting. An ideal price for this title would be between 10 and 15 dollars as of when this review is going up. I'm only a quarter of the way through and I have to say, if the game is as long as I believe it is and keeps presenting new and interesting challenges along the way, it would be worth playing through at least once even at full price.\n\nTLDR, 8 out of 10. I would say this is a very good break-out title for the developer Games Farm, and we'll be expecting to see bigger, faster, harder and better from them in the future.","April 29, 2015","true","4.3"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","8","10","0","0"

It was not mainstream, from a small studio, with occasional bugs but funny as hell. Similar is Shadows. I started with beta version and there were problems but with every patch game got better and more stable. Since official release I had no crashes and game runs fine. I tested this game on 2560*1440 and it looks and runs great. Very attractive element of Shadows Heretic Kingdoms is its main character and a unique party system. You can switch between the Devourer and up to three party members, each with their own special abilities. You can even switch between worlds to survive otherwise lost battles, avoid traps and solve puzzles. First I played as Jasper, archer and I liked his stunning arrows. Later I acquired Urshak, a little one, who can make bombs and traps and I liked him even more. During next hours I was able to play with more characters with quite different combat styles.\nMusic is great, done by Budapest orchestra.\nYou can buy a mainstream game for triple price only to realize later that its nothing special but if you are looking for something unusual you should try these small budget games.\nAlmost all new games, even with millions of dollars budgets, have some bugs and problems and Shadows in no exception but unique and funny environment, characters and story makes it for 20 euro a game worth buying.\n","December 1, 2014","true","26.2"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","0"

Sadly i have to give this negative review, the voice acting, and the story is very well done, but its hardly enjoyable to play, it has too many cooldowns, in my opinion to make a game fun, remove the cooldowns just base it on mana, take some advice from Diablo II it has almost perfect gameplay aspects, and even today the graphics hasnt aged as much as others from its time.\nAll of these new age aspects in gaming are generally bad in terms of a lasting game with a great replay value, please fix the combat, it has such a great potential and doesnt need to be so rudimental and insanely dull. I really tried to give it a good chance and play through, but i cant urge myself to finish the game, the skills, items and combat need big changes, i hope the developers are listening, because i want to be able to come back and give a positive review.\nThank you for your time","May 15, 2015","false","5.9"," 10 of 20 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","10","20","0","1"

Monotonous landscapes, linear levels who are no fun to explore because you only find barrels and co to loot. Upgrading skills is no fun either. I bought it for 10 euro and even that's not worth it. Last but not least I want to add that I'm sad about that gamng experience because I like the idea of playing a demon and not a human again who also can controll up to 6 puppets of different races. You can switch during battle and off battle between your different characters and that's a nice twist. I also liked the idea that the demon is dressed with runes and not common weapons and gear.

Some would say that controls are only part of the game, but to them I say, it's one of the few things that you have to deal with for the entirety of the game. It's not something to take lightly.\n\nAt Shadows: Heretic Kingdoms' current price it comes off as a tough sale even if this game has a lot of promise. If you're really into ARPG's you might have a difficult time over-looking them. If you're casual ARPG player, this may not affect you at all. I would keep your eye on this and when people stop complaining about "sluggish" controls, it would make the price a lot easier to swallow.\n\nThis isn't a title to write off.

Twice the fun, right?\n\nTwo worlds, 1 ShadowNot really. The two worlds thing is nice in theory, but it ends up being a chore. I have to wander around an area as 1 dude then wander around as the other. Sure, it's not that bad and I could easily deal with it by switching it up while I'm still in the same area, right? Both sets of characters take FOREVER to get around. They're far too slow in general. Later on I unlocked an Archer type dude who was ever so slightly faster and it still took far too long to wander around. This is an Action, Hack'n'Slash, right? You know, ARPG like Diablo? It sure doesn't feel or act that way. I literally looked around for a Diablo 2 style Sprint button or toggle; didn't find one. If you're not going to give us the means to move faster then at least make the characters FAST themselves, geez.\n\nHows the Voice Acting?The voice acting is grand! It's great to hear everything instead of having to read literally everything. Sadly, the sound mixing is terrible. Voices either cut off other voices or are automatically played right after the next even if you heard it mutiple times already. There is large amount of NPC's that only have a single thing to say. Some voice volumes are unbalanced and are often too loud when compared to voicing before it or during. For example, I was talking to Morphew and there was constantly a weird busy market place sound effect that contains some yelling that would continue to pop up as he was speaking forcing me to read the text instead of hearing the lovely voice acting.\n\nHows the rest of the sound?Annoying as heck! Just playing the very beginning-ish area with the Shadow guy and hearing the Soul sound effect over and over at the exact same volume each time without any fading or canceling, was like nails on a chalkboard. Then you have mutiple enemies all playing the same loud dying sound effect as well, over and over again everytime. It reminded me of bad Tablet games where they just let the sound effects cut in and out without any control or balance but it wasn't enough to abandon ship just yet. The only good thing sound wise was the music and how it would change based on what world you're in.\n\nCut Scene VideosI have no idea what's going on with them but they look to be pre-recorded poorly rendered videos and watching them on my large monitor felt as if I was rubbing the screen with my eyeballs. Crazy pixelation and overall poor quality.\n\nIs there anything else "good"?Believe it or not, the story. I was more invested in the story of who is the Hooded Man, what happened to Kalig and overall my evil shadowy self then I ever was in Diablo 3. There also a few quests that seemed entirely optional and gave a worth while reward at the end of it. However, the "search for intel" related quests were utterly terrible pieces of nonsense. It went on for too long and the quest markers kind of broke during it. The UI is also very good in most areas. The inventory UI seems a tad large and in your face for my liking but at least it was easy to be effective with it. I could tell it was really trying to have only a single window for shops, inventory and character equipped items.\n\nBugs and GlitchesYeah, it should be noted that there are some bugs and glitches. Some areas that look walkable aren't or the pathing is off. Some times an enemy can sit in an area where you're not able to walk towards and thus cannot attack them. Often the screen seems to have visual tears even with V-Sync on and having tweaked the settings.\n\nWhat made me quit out?I ignored everything else mentioned above in order to play the game and see what it had to offer. Again, keeping in mind that I really wanted to enjoy and love the game.\n\nThe combat is what killed it for me. Besides the fact that the game thought shoving me onto a level 19 character with a bunch of skills that I didn't know what any of them did was a good idea when It wasn't... I could never get past the strange disconnection from the characters. Every attack feels as if it's turn based instead of an ARPG. I walk over to get in range and stand there spamming the attack button, waiting for the attack animation to start up and then attempt to hit them until X target dies. It annoys me how long it takes between each attack and that movement is obviously slow for only you as enemies can zip around while you're still starting up your attack. In short, it's mind numbingly slow. I used the Shadow guy and Kalig, both felt the same. Both had the same issue. Only Kalig had it worse. His attack animation is so long that it could easily be canceled out of. No damage is done to your target when this happens. It makes the fact that you can MISS even more annoying.\nEven just breaking a bunch of Urns and Barrels takes far too long. The slow nature of attacking makes everything related to it a chore or a test of will. Skills? Nah, they're just as slow and awkward. Skills and normal attacks can hit targets that should clearly be out of range. Some times your first skill as quite the long cooldown making combat entirely about single targeting every enemy.\n\nThe combat is so slow nothing I do with skills feels rewarding. There is no satisfaction from using an AoE skill to kill off a number of enemies as I have to wait to do anything at all times.","June 21, 2015","false","1.7"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","20","1","5","2","0"

A diablo-clone with emphasis on story, choices and a planeshifting mechanic?\n\nI was expecting a modernized mix of Soul Reaver and Divine Divinity, but it was never going to meet my high hopes. Especially since the developer is in legal trouble with their publisher and we can't expect a second game/"book" anytime soon\n\nThe story never manages to seem much more than a loredump, and another hunt for a magical MacGuffin. You get to control multiple characters with different personalities, but there's not enough consistent flavor in much of the dialog and it is often immersion breaking to see so many options that only make sense when we break the 4th wall and consider that the *player* might want to ask or say something, rather than the character.\n\nThere are also various situations that would fit a moral/story choice quite naturally, but the game ignores the opportunity.\n\nAs a pure diablo-clone, the game is average at best. There are some enemies that are interesting because their gimmicks make use of the plane-shifting mechanic, but otherwise, the designs are boring, your characters' skills start feeling incredibly samey as you grow in levels and unlock more, and they very rarely feel like they pack any punch or are otherwise significant. The combat does not have the *feel* that can really elevate a simple diablo-clone.\n\nThe loot is simply dreadful. Very rarely will you stumble on any gear with enchantments or anything of the sort. Aside from healing potions and herbs, the crafting system may as well not be there, it is that useless!\n\nThe game is also a disaster on technical level. With a Nvidia GTX 560Ti, I can barely ever get above 40 fps while playing at 1080 resolution. The combat is often incredibly unresponsive: game drops skill commands done mid attack animation, does not buffer movement clicks well when you really *need* to move in a hurry, and your auto-attack does not continue if the enemy that you're attacking moves from under your mouse cursor. The loading times are also quite bad, especially if you teleport into Realm of Souls, the one place where you can switch "party members"\n\nThen, after going through all this, the game ends after a super dull bossfight with an annoying cliffhanger that will never get payoff.\n\nShadows: Heretic Kingdoms is truly a mediocre, disappointing title. The concept may intrigue, but the lack of excellence in *any* field, and lack of competence in some, will turn this game into a chore before you get outside the gates of your starting city.","June 24, 2015","false","20.0"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","3","0","0"

The "partial controller support" tag is, alas, misleading.\n\nThis game looks like it could and should be brilliant.  I was immediately drawn into the game-- which made it all the more painful when it crashed.  Unfortunately, I experienced multiple crashes in the first ten minutes of the game (before and after the very first "shadow" bridge).  I use an xbox360 controller.\n\nIn troubleshooting threads, the developer has acknowledged that the CTD problem lays with controller support.  The developer stated that people having this problem should wait until a patch is released.  However, insolvency proceedings affecting the publisher bitComposer are currently preventing the rollout of new patches.\n\nI did a crash-free, albeit short run with k+m for diagnostic purposes.  People who see the "controller support" tag on this game's steam page should be aware of the problem with controller support.\n\nNonetheless, I am thankful that the developers have attempted to integrate controller support into this excellent-looking game.   For that reason, I'm not inclined to regret my purchase.  I guess I'll sit back and hope an update is rolled out that fixes the gamepad crash problem.\n","June 10, 2015","false","2.0"," 4 of 12 people (33%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","33","4","12","2","0"

Not "largely unfinished" in the sense that it doesn't conclude, but unfinished insomuch as the game yields 5-10 hours of gameplay in total.  That's it.\n\nThe mechanics of swapping between the shadow/real realm, and swapping puppets in combat to chain constant stuns is interesting, but that interest is short lived.  Once you get into a rhythm of chaining two or three stuns between your puppets, you infinitely lock down enemies.  Bosses aren't much of a challenge when you can ensure they never move, let alone attack, for as long as you can keep swapping and stunning.\n\nOnce Book II is released, and an initial hand at balancing passes over the game, it may be worth a buy if it's on sale.  For right now this is not worth putting down the money.","March 29, 2015","false","17.0"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","3","10","0","0"

It is a visually appealing game but the UI is lacking,  items on the ground are virtually invisible unless you hold the alt key to highlight them and the inventory can become cluttered.  Unfortunately I can not comment on the complete story as I encountered a save file bug 7 hours in that froze my character in place whenever I loaded the file preventing me from advancing any further and I was not compelled by the story at that point to bother replaying it.\nHopefully these issues will be remedied in any future sequals/updates as I feel there is potential here especially with the party system, switching between 4 characters and chaining their abilities to melt your enemies was very satisfying.\n\n+Appealing graphics\n+Unique party system\n\n-Game breaking bugs (may be solved in future updates)\n-Slow combat and cumbersome movement (clinking near an enemy will cause your character to attack making positioning difficult)\n\n+/- Story had some highlights but mostly bland (unable to complete the full story due to bug)\n+/- Gamepad support, I personally love playing games with a controller but at the time of this review the gamepad controls were bugged and would crash the game after several minutes of play.

After winning it in the Auction I was excited to try it out.\n\nIt didn't take long for me to become disappointed. The movement in the game is clunky and a lot of the time your character will stand there doing nothing. I've had to press Esc a few times because I thought my game locked up. The difficulty of the game is pretty average, the further along you go one of your characters becomes broken enough to solo everything. The final boss of this "book" was a complete joke, on top of that there's almost no challenge.\n\nWhat I thought was going to be a game with some story and great gameplay turned into mindlessly slaughtering small groups of enemies with terrible A.I with almost no story at all, apart from the couple main quests you get.\n\nStereotypical "You're the chosen one!" Story with random sidequests to find X or kill Y. Being locked out of "Exclusive Retail Version Content!" is also pretty lame, considering you get the quests and the achievements exist for everyone. Although they apologized for it, it's still a shame.\n\n\nThere are some up sides to the game, thankfully. The boss battles felt unique and were fun to do, still not the challenge I was hoping for. With a quicksave feature in place, there was no sense of danger since you could just reload 2 seconds before where you died. The skill system is average at best, there still only felt like the classic "Mage, Archer, Warrior" classes, with most of the spells doing the exact same thing with just different particles. The "Shadow Realm" aspect brought something neat to the game, only during the puzzles though. Everytime else it felt useless unless you had to switch for a brief second to go through a wall that was blocked in the mortal realm.\n\nI guess if you get the game extremely cheap you could have minimal fun playing it for as short as it is. The Dev's think they're doing you a favor with the "Reduced Early Access Price". This first half of the game is supposed to be complete, but it feels like a huge rushed mess.\n\n\n\n","December 27, 2014","false","5.2"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

I am pretty sure its my PC.... but Considering i can play games like Advanced Warfare with lag only when its loading its kinda odd. Anyway Overall the game is good. If the Lag Problem can be fixed it would be awesome. Until then for me its just not that fun. That was the previous version tho not sure about the newer one...","November 20, 2014","true","21.6"," 6 of 48 people (13%) found this review helpful","13","6","48","0","0"

All 5 attacks the same, even the \"upgrades\" did very little. So to force diversity the only difference is some charatcers are tanky and others do elemental damage that you sometimes need to bypass resists to other damage types. I think they only programmed the 5 attacks and just used different graphics for each character to make them different.\n\nI could have played the game, got over the generic loot treadmill and mediocre story. Graphics are decent. But the same attacks for everyone killed it for me.","June 1","false","3.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
