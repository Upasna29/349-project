It concerns a young man named Jack who is alive (on Earth?) in the distant future, after some sort of apocolyptic event.  There is an interesting contrast of the dark age that Jack lives in and the crumbling infastructure of present day life that is completely alien to him. (He doesn't know what power lines are but carries a sword for protection, and the narrator describes the powerlines as monuments built by ancient rulers, for example.)\n\nThe narrator does a good job overall, his voice is pleasant and easy to understand.\n\nI have not spent lots of time in this experience but I will finish it as I work my way through the list of available HTC Vive content.  Thank you to the devs for creating this and I look forward to seeing this new medium evolve.\n\nFor $2, about the price of a bottle of soda, I highly recommend you check out "Andromedum."","April 26","true","0.3"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Say, a Harry Potter book reading.  As they read, you go from under the cupboard to the hotel, the shack, on the train, in Diagon Alley, so forth.\nIf you want to read a new book in a new way, this is one way to do it.  I liked it but others may not.","May 10","true","0.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

A story is read out loud by a male voice and you can read along with the book that is attached to one of Vive's motion controllers. There is no interaction with the player besides the reader reading the story. As the story progresses the visuals are changed to match the story. The visuals are beautifully done but static and room scale is not supported. There are small visual issues here and there but nothing important.\n\nI'd recommend this audio book if you're into this sort of thing, definitely at this price. The reader is pleasant enough to listen to. I haven't finished the story yet (just started chapter 3) but so far the story is not bad although somewhat predictable.\nThis isn't a good VR demo showcase -- don't buy this to show your friends what VR can do.","May 5","true","0.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
