It's largely the same game, using the same map and same general mechanics, but with the inclusion of multiplayer and achievements, as well as some general questline/mechanic improvements - it's basically the same game, but more. There's effectively no advantages this original game has over Warband, so it's not really worth purchasing. The one exception to this rule is that there were some mods created for it which did not get ported to Warband, so take a look at those via a Google search to see if one of them might be up your alley.\n\nIf you're trying to complete your library or support the developer/publisher? By all means.

The only reason you should buy or play this version of the game is for the mods that were built for this and not Warband. The most notable being Star Wars: Conquest, which is a total conversion mod for the game that takes the core gameplay elements and replaces the story, setting, characters, mythos, universe, etc with faithful Star Wars content. That mod is what would make me recommend this to people. If you're a fan of Star Wars you NEED to play Star Wars: Conquest, and the only way to do so is with this base game.","August 9, 2013","true","9.8"," 102 of 118 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","102","118","0","1"

You can either be a jerk and chase down peasants and slaughter them, or you can drive bandits out of small towns or stop the enemy lord from pillaging the neighboring town. Be involved in battles for cities or castles with hundreds, maybe even thousands if u want to (i have). Now you have to start off right because i have 1 good character and 3 other bad ones. so dont fool around and get captured by bandits or a mean lord. When you get to my level (which is probably real bad compared to some hardcore mount and blade fan out there), you can battle bandits all by yourself, and just bow them down as they come at you. its a great game with neverending places to capture and people to kill (there's a limit of places, but the people just keep comin! how many babies have to be born with the fact i have killed 35k people)! Worth the money too, trust me, I am a stickler for buying games for any kind of money.

Once you develop an understanding of what's going on and what to do, the game really starts to open up. It doesn't help that you start off all alone with a low-level character with no one else in your party. That's the challenge though! Tournaments are a good way to learn the fighting mechanics. Level up by fighting small parties of bandits (a horse makes things loads easier) and recruit villagers to your party, who will also level up. Launch sieges against castles or defend your castles against sieges. Eventually, you get a lordship and maybe even kingship, but I haven't gotten that far yet.","November 25, 2013","true","24.9"," 77 of 86 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","77","86","0","0"

I absolutely love this series!\n\nWarband is easily the best of the 3 available, with superior mod support, however, the orignal M&B is still very good. If you are able to choose, definitely go with Warhand, which is basically a more fleshed-out version of the original game. While playing the original, I did notice that some of my favorite mods did not get ported over to Warband, so make sure you check out the mod community for M&B to see if anything there interests you.\n\nMuch of the aesthetics, controls, and gameplay mirror Warband, so here is my review.\n\nThere usually is only a few dollars difference between M&B and Warband whenever they both go on sale, so be sure to pick up Warband if possible (or both, if you like collecting).\n\nDespite the more superior Warband being available, this is still a great game, and you should try it out if you are interested in sampling the series.\n\nCheers,\nDJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews","August 16, 2014","true","2.8"," 56 of 58 people (97%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","97","56","58","4","0"

The combat, both on horseback and on foot, just felt off.  In addition, there is almost no story.  And the graphics are definitely outdated.  So why the positive review?  This is a game that grows on you, but only if you give it time.  The early stages where you have nothing are frustrating, as you can't do much and are easily defeated.  But if you can weather this period, the game opens up as you build up supplies and equipment and soldiers.  In addition, the combat becomes much more intuitive as you spend time with it.  You are soon able to best larger armies due to your skill level, as well as the quality of your equipment and soldiers.  Unfortunately, it's at this point that the game feels a bit broken.  The whole game revolves around several factions that own various towns and are at war with each other, and you generally align yourself with one of these factions.  No matter how well you equip your crew at this point in the game, you almost always encounter insurmountable odds when you face any of the opposing factions in combat.  For example, you might be limited to a party of 60, but will regularly encounter parties of opposing factions that range from 100-200.  Worse yet, even if you're able to best such a large party, it's almost a given that the opposing faction will have another party or two in the area, each with 100+ soldiers.  It never feels like your faction supports you as much as other factions support them.  In addition, conquering all of a faction's towns seems next to impossible as the towns are dispersed over quite a large area on the map.  While you might conquer several towns in one area, it could take you several in-game days to travel to the next area to conquer that faction's remaining towns.  Meanwhile, those initial towns you conquered have been conquered by one of the game's other factions, as you typically spread yourself thin trying to attack so many areas.  Overall, I know that I've pointed out several flaws with this game so far.  That being said, I feel like these issues don't detract from the game so much overall, as addressing them would make the sequel that much better.  I really enjoyed this game, but a sequel that addressed my issues would be worth a lot of money to me.  This game was good, but I look forward to checking out more from this franchise.  I would give this game a 7.5/10.","October 13, 2015","true","31.4"," 58 of 69 people (84%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","84","58","69","3","3"

Mound and Blade games are very open ended, and have tons of stuff to do. I recommend anyone who likes RPGs try the Mount and Blade games, while there may be some other games like the Mount and Blade games out there, Mount and Blade really did find its niche, and it sure has gotten a lot of fans since then.","May 12","true","14.3"," 19 of 20 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","19","20","0","0"

But... it turns out that Warband singleplayer can't be achieved when you're not connected to Internet. So now I see the point to hold this game altogether with Warband. I suggest you to buy the whole bundle, where will be Warband, Napoleonic Wars and Fire'n'Sword.\n\nI'm in love with that game, I've bought it triple times. I've spended thousands of hours riding and hacking, over and over. Basic Mount'n'Blade runs even with the very dull PCs, like ones we use in offices, you know - with lame videocard, very short amount of RAM... it all doesn't matter! All you need is some free time (you can't play it during your working time, like some facebook flashgames) and testosterone. Yeah, I repeat - in there you'll be riding your horse and constantly brutally punish whoever gets in your way, in that glorified, one-of-a-kind simulator of medieval mercenary.\n\nIf you play while connected to the Internet, and have at least a discrete videocard on your PC and 2Gb of RAM - go straight for Warband, which includes this game PLUS gorgeus multiplayer. Plus achievements, trading cards, all of stuff you'd expecting on Steam. But if you suddenly find yourself somewhere in Australia, or just on the farm where you have only outdated laptop from the early 00's... This game is one of the best that you can play out there.\n\nGame itself deserves 8.5/10 mark for its uniqueness and impact on the gaming world. Although as a sandbox RPG-like it is quickly wears off, as a medieval simulator, it's just keep going. And going. And going. Much like that battery rabbit, or the Civilization game.","November 21, 2015","true","2.9"," 50 of 74 people (68%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","68","50","74","7","5"

From my experience, Mount & Blade offers a unique gaming experience. Not quite like anything else I've ever played. There are some similarities to familiar games, such as shades of the Total War series, but stark enough differences that they really cannot be compared. Mount & Blade in my opinion is fairly easy to learn, but does take some skill with action type fighting to be mastered. If you enjoy strategy games with a turn based feel, mixed with real time combat, in a non-linear world; then Mount & Blade may just well be your cup of tea.\n\nI was looking for a somewhat decent strategy game that would run on my gutless business laptop and I have to say I was not expecting as good of a game as it turned out to truly be. It's got enough meat in the vanilla campaign to keep most people busy for at least 100 hours I would speculate, though I personally have already invested 200 hours into my first vanilla campaign and can see it dragging out another 100-200 easily.\n\nBeyond the vanilla game, there are apparently many mods made for this game as well. Some appear to be quite promising and I will surely be giving at least a few a spin. All in all I would highly recommend this game. I bought it on sale and was skepticle, but having now played it, I would have paid the full price and not felt shorted in any way. Well worth the money imho.\n\n+ Cheap.\n+ Very low system requirements - should run well on most machines.\n+ Time consuming single player campaign (I'm not interested in a game if it can be beaten in less then 48 hours of actual gameplay).\n+ Easy to learn, yet unique combat system that is both fun and requires skill to master.\n+ High replayability due to massive amount of community mods available.\n\n- AI is not the greatest and can be stomped fight after fight once you learn it's flaws. I'm talking I have decimated a larger opposing army almost by myself. Siege AI is almost worse, you can take any city with 10 men once you have learned their flaws. They don't fare any better trying to take a city from you either. 10 men could hold off thousands if you know what you're doing.\n\nOVERALL 9/10 AND I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND TO ANY TRUE STRATEGY FAN.\n","December 11, 2014","true","275.8"," 20 of 22 people (91%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","91","20","22","2","0"

But this game grew on me quite quickly.\n\nPROs:\n- RPG elements like you being the main character that can shape the game, depending on how you go about it. What kingdom you join, what do you do within it, ect. Stats and leveling up, equipment, politics, companions.\n- Decent character facial customisation for characters (atleast as far as the proportions of the head/face are concerned) decent amount of hair and facial hair (males) choices. (This is BASE game customisation. Why do I mention that? Well... )\n- High modability - There is lots of player made content that can be downloaded and applied to the game, either changing your main game in small ways, or providing you with an entirely new campaign by playing overhails (aka new natives/scenarios) which generally are packed full of content. The content may range from simply newly aranged maps, new kingdoms, ect. To including brand new character models, even races for very few of the mods out there. Lots of new weapons/armors/units.\n- Decent amount of battle terrains (The area in which you fight with your army in real time when you engage a foe. The way it looks. ) These can be pretty cool in some mods out there.\n\n\nCONs:\n- Even if you own beast PC, in large battles, the game is prone to crash some times. And if you don't save regularly.. that can set you back pretty far.\n- Castle sieges are pretty basic, they are down to battles of attrition. The person with the most and most experienced bodies will be the one to win.\n- Factions with mostly mounted units are unfairly strong in comparison to factions with primarily unmounted units. In the base game, that means the Khergits. You will learn to hate them, pretty fast. (Luckily this can be counter-acted with the use of mods, and some overhauls [aka non base game maps] have scripts and options in place to allow foot soldiers with spears to combat mounted soldiers.\n- Spear bracing. On the topic of mounted units... those that have spears, will eventually go into a state known as spear bracing, which will do massive damage to any enemy unit the spear comes in contact with. Whilst this can be very good for hit and run attacks for the player as a mounted combatant, it can be pretty bad for the player's units, or the player themselves if they are faced with alot of mounted opponents, who will very likely get a guaranteed one hit KO using that, even on heavily armored units some times.\n- Multiplayer is mostly very bad, or if I have to be kind.. bland, repetative and pointless. ( Though there are some mods out there that are ONLY playable in multiplayer. I have not tested any of them yet, due to the fact that this game is my jam where single-player is concerned. But I have read good things about some of them. Unfortunatley most of them don't last long, too. Teams often abandon them and stop hosting.)\n\n\nOTHER STUFF: (That is neither a pro nor a con)\n- Combat is directional. With good enough timing and mouse movement, aswell as footwork, you will likely be able to dispatch any opponent, even if they are more well armed or stronger than you. Parrying is also directional, meaning that with good enough choice of direction in which to parry, you can defend yourself with your two handed/one handed weapon and signifficantly reduce the damage you endure. Shields are something you should always have on you. They will take the brunt of ranged attacks against your back when they ARE on your back, will block ranged attacks and melee attacks very efficiently when used in offhand, but will eventually break. Luckily...\n- You can pick up weapons and shields dropped on the ground by dead units. Its a bit tricky and not recommended to try if there are enemies around you, but if you are out of arrows, and there's a dead archer nearby who's arrow quiver is somewhere around him, you can take it. If your shield is broken, you can pick up some dead footman's shield instead. These are NOT kept after the battle is over, your original equipment is the one that will be equipped on you once it is. So don't be afraid of loosing weaponry.\n- You can carry weapons in your inventory that you can switch to at the stash in the starting location of your army in a battle, incase you are facing a foe that your current loadout is not effective to deal with.\n- Armies march on their stomach. Inventory Management will become a skill that will be valuable if you plan to have a large army, so that you can carry a bunch of food with you.\n- You will hate loosing experienced soldiers. And sometimes during battle, weak pawns will take down your fully upgraded troops. This will mostly kill them, which is why investing in the skill "Surgeon" will become a must, as each point adds a 4% chance that a party member, when struck down, will be knocked unconscious instead of dying. This chance is added to a base chance of 25%. At level 10 of the skill, thats 40% + 25% = 65%. Meaning that you will not have to sacrifice experienced troops needlessly.\n\n\nThere is .. much more I could say about this game, but I will have to simply say...\nBUY IT.\nEven at retail price its worth it. As always, buying when its discounted is the wisest choice, and luckily M&B gets discounted every now and then.\nBut I should note, I wrote this review, before writing one of the next game in the series, which is M&B: Warband. It improves upon what is already there, and I recommend you get it instead if you only want one game. I got this one so that I could play mods that are restricted to it, and not playable on warband. You'll likely find modded scenarios to be the most enjoyable aspect very soon, and that will make getting this worth it.\n\nMy final score? Solid 9/10, not counting the bugs that *can* occur and the minor nuissances about some ingame aspects. With those in mind, it would be more like a 8/10.","November 7, 2014","true","8.9"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","10","10","3","0"

Until then I accidentally joined in a war. Now I know what you're thinking...\n\nHow does someone accidentally join a war?!\n\nWell.... You see I had a quest to stop this war with 2 kingdoms, and the only way was to convince the lords to stop fighting... Which of course, didn't work, because the lords' wanted 7200 denars to stop, or you could persuade one of them, at the sacrifice of our friendship. But I wasn't friends with any of them, so to become one of the lords' friend, I did some quests. This was working... Until I got a quest about meeting a spy.

Using either mouse or keyboard you can select a myriad of different attacks and blocks depending on the weapon you're using as you engage in high intensity melee's with hundreds of opponents.\n\nYou play the game in two modes, the world map and the battle map. The world map is where you walk your hero across the land, recruit soldiers, buy weapons and goods and find bands of enemies to fight. When you go into battle you are transported onto a procedurally generated battle map where you get you fight your enemies with whatever weapons and soldiers are at your disposal. Although both of these modes are plagued with a number of bugs and rather noticeable lack of polish the core of the fighting remains fun and challenging and makes you forgive the flaws you may encounter.\n\nGraphically Mount & Blade is nothing too impressive. It's full of rough edges and flat surfaces and you know it's an indie title when you play it. The sound is similarly lacking and not much to talk about.\n\nBut despite all it's flaws this is just one of those few rare games that manages to live through a low budget, bad tech and broken features through a strong and simple core mechanic. The fighting is excellent and there are enough mods available to remedy many of the problems on the world map. Although this is a title that will never quite feel like it should be classic it still manages to hold a strong place in your memory.\n\nAlthough this is an excellent game that I throughly enjoyed playing it is not one I would recommend you buy these days simply because the Warband standalone expansion is pretty much just an updated version of this.","January 7, 2013","true","465.3"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Pros: Combat system is similar to what I'd been dreaming up to maybe make a mod for a Bethesda game, battles are an epic scale for a game (size can be changed in options, mine's set to 100), realistic enough for immersion, not so realistic as to be frustrating (in general), great arena system, good fief management (though I'm still having trouble making my villages more prosperous, which would probably be easier if I gave it some attention instead of constantly charging into battle, but who cares). Cons: no magic (but three types of projectile, mounted combat, etc. make up for it in my opinion), graphics (not a big deal to me, computer isn't great anyway, and it's an old game, so not surprising), no multiplayer option (though sequels have it and npcs are good enough and more likely to respond to commands if you have authority), can't personally become a monarch or promote vassals (though again, sequels), no real tutorial outside of combat (pointers: hire soldiers before traipsing around bandit-infested territory, don't accept quests with targets deep in enemy territory, etc.).

Beware tough..getting captured is no fun..oh and don't forget to stock up on food..and being able to pay your soldiers..and not upsetting mighty lords..and behaving knightly.

You start off as a lone wolf working for small villages then working your way up to the kingdoms. You can be hired as a hitman or scout around enemy towns and learn of weak spots to engage. You can join any one of the kingdoms but by gaining new friends you also gain new enemies. You engage your enemies in an open battlefield with changing terrain and changing weather conditions so no battle is ever the same. You have an arsenal of weapons, armor, and horse at your disposal so feel free to acquire as much as you want. If you are feeling like making some money easily then you can sign up for tournaments and fight your way to victory. Mount and Blade is an amazing RPG that deserves more recognition.

The game really reaches its peak about 20/30 hours in, when your character is strong enough - and your army large enough - to take on each realm's king and his massive personal guard. The only real issue is that there's too much sandbox: your goal is to "make a name for yourself." Which would be fine and dandy if you were allowed to become a king and unite the country; however, you're specifically forbidden from doing this. You're told flat-out at the beginning of the game that you can't become king. Kind of obnoxious. Also, you can't kill empires, as noblemen live forever and will swarm cities until they can re-establish their clan. So one you reach that point where a normal RPG would reward you with huge tracts of land, you instead export your character and start all over again, but this time with insanely high skills that let you fight just about anything and really screw with the early-game dynamic.

There, he befriended a local nobleman, negotiated for peace between waring kingdoms, herded cattle, protected the honour of a noblewoman and raided the many maruaders that littered the country side.\n\nEventually, this adventurer, from hopeless beginnings, rose to become tournament champion and Lord Vassal of a great nation. This is just the beginning however, for the road ahead will be paved with many more battles, each either bringing bountiful victories or devastating defeats.","February 12, 2014","true","15.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You get a great combination of action in the medieval combat, strategy in the larger scale battles, and role-playing game classics such as choosing alliances and missions, leveling up, and suiting up.\n\nWith that said, the role-playing aspect couldn't be considered truly complete on its own. Your personal relationships with lords, for instance, does indeed evolve somewhat and have an impact on the options available to you, but the relationship mechanisms in place are a little shallow. This part of the game sort of comes across as a roleplaying sandbox and only a stick to dig with.\n\nCombat and looting also suffer some issues, but overall the combat system is pretty satisfying (though you'll see what I'm talking about when you're trying to pick up weapons in the tournaments). A variety of fairly viable combat styles are available to your character, though you'll usually have to adapt to the context of the battle.\n\nSpeaking of the battle contexts, you're offered a number of different scenarios, from open battles on the field to raiding throne rooms to laying siege to cities or castles. You can thus get a nice taste sword and shield battle atop a wall as well hit-and-run with mounted archery in the field.\n\nThese styles and contexts also flow nicely out of the nature of your army and their background, with the Khergit, Swadians, Rhodoks, Vaegirs, and Nords differing significantly in their typical strategies. For many people that enjoy these games, the tactics surrounding match ups between these factions is the heart of what makes the game unique.\n\nAnyway, overall awesome. I look forward to trying the Warband expansion where some things will be fixed and some content will be added.","December 27, 2013","true","33.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

What an epic game! Yes, it's graphics are horrid, and yes, there are a few small bugs left in there, but wow, I'm currently clocked in at 63 hours, and I know that I've at least a few more days to go until I'm satisfied with this game, and even then, I'll probably make a new character just to follow another king.\n\nThis game is amazing, terrific, wonderful, and much more! Combine the combat of Chivalry and the overworld trading business with the flash game "Caravaneer", and this is a lot better yet. After you get through the slow tutorial, it's a challenging, yet EXTREMELY rewarding climb from nothing to king, one that 63 hours in, I have yet to achieve. The feeling of training peasants to fight bandits, then watching them go at it right afterward is epic and makes you feel like you've made a significant difference to their lives. The first army you take on and defeat leaves you gasping for breath, sweat on your forhead, and prideful of your newfound superiority. Now we get to move on to the big guns: Taking fortresses and fortefied cities! And that's a LOT more fun than it sounds!\n\nThere is one big problem that has to be addressed, and that is the games difficulty. I had no problem with difficulty because I had all the options set to easiest (so that I feel like a boss), but I'm on "22% difficulty". If you are someone who can't stand playing on Easy, then this might be a bit rough for you and your armies.\n\nI cannot reccomend this game enough, ecspecially to those who love build-your-army type games! Once you have a feel for all the weaponry (small changes make big differences), and what race of soldier can accomplish what, you can progress rather well, and this game has been nothing but fun all the way!\n\nBut it!

This game also has factions and a pretty interesting story.\n\nThis game is rich in content because of the variety it has. The player can hire people from random villages on a huge map to fight at your side. Also, it has inventory, level system and several interaction menus. The player can conquest villages, start a fight or get involved in a huge fight between other factions. Finally, the player can build his own way to achieve a better status on the game.\n\nIt is really fun because the user not only has the base game.

Warband simply has more features, although this is practically the same game. Warband has a multiplayer, more immersive gameplay and includes the ability to rule your own kingdom; which this lacks. It is simply not a good idea to buy both this and Warband, you will likley be disapointed, unless of course you buy the full collection. So basically my advice is, either buy Warband by itself, or the full collection.","May 14","true","1.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","2","2","2","0"

Making an army to fight other lords that are your enemy or just in your way gets you in huge battles that are the most interesting and enjoyable part of this game. Riding on the back of your horse and shooting your bow is just so much fun to do. Charging into an enemy and to swing your sword into his body to see a nice number of damage pop up gives you just a good feeling of an accomplishment, because it's pretty hard to do. It might get a bit boring after playing it for a while since it's a bit repetitive, but I can easyally say that this is one of my favourite medieval themed game that I've played so far.","December 23, 2012","true","134.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Because its made by indie devs (very successful ones at that) This comes with the advantage of having extremely down to earth devs, who have made this game as gamers. Have you ever wanted to live in mideval times? Here ya go. There are 5 kingdoms, each who contest for ultimate domination. Neither can maintain peace or decide on total war. There are kingdoms, such as the Nords, based on the Vikings....or the Kerghit Khans, based on Genghis Khan or Attila the Hun...or Vaegers, based on Russians. Many more.

Mount & Blade puts you in the role of an adventurer in a land torn apart by wars, both civil and regular. Build your band of mercenaries, perform errands for kings, train the villagers to defend themselves, and shoot your bow from horseback (good luck with that last one).\n\nMount & Blade is like Elder Scrolls on crack. Much less structured storyline, much bigger sandbox. This is what I imagine a Game of Thrones game would be like.\n\nThe political systems are really cool, but combat has a pretty steep learning curve. Play the tutorial, then play through the training missions in-game. And srsly, if you can shoot a bow from horseback with any accuracy, my hat's off to ya. I think it might actually be easier in real life. Never ridden a horse, but I've shot a bow, and that's a lot harder in this game than it is in my backyard.\n\nSword and board is a lot like Oblivion or Skyrim, but more... I dunno. Just better. You have finer control.\n\nA-. This is one of those games that I keep meaning to go back to, but then realize that I'd have to start all over from scratch because I don't remember how to play.","April 21, 2012","true","5.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

When it was released it was epic. Seriously one of the best RPGs you could find. Simple enough to grasp the concepts quickly and yet with enough depth to surprise you after even 30 hours played. Everyon who played it, loved it.\nThen Taleworld released M&B Warband. And everyone felt a little cheated. Reason being it revealed that the original M&B was essentially a Beta. Warband had all the little things that M&B was missing. Starting your own nation, getting married for political purposes, even a health meter for your horse.\nThen came Fire and Sword. Bleh.\nWarband is the game I would recomend, especially if your going un-modded or just small mods.\nBut my real recomendation is that you buy M&B and then get the LOTR mod overhaul. This is the best mod ever. Complete Lord of The Rings overhaul. the guys who made this spent 4 years on it. Incredible. Well worth the $10 bucks you'd spend on this game.","February 9, 2015","true","196.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Elephants are very essential to life in this game. AWW... who am I kidding, there are no elephants, but i wish there were.

It's SUPER immersive if you can look past the old character graphics.\n\nPros:\n\n- Immersive\n- Beautiful Enviroment graphics for it's age\n- Mounted Combat\n- Challenging and strategic battles and missions\n- Literally can choose whatever you want to be\n\nCons:\n\n- Not so appealing Character Graphics\n- No voice acting, it's old so it's expected, just be prepared to read a lot.\n- Many options to start out but very offer the advantage you need to get ahead\n- Late game Bandits a bit too OP, always had issues with them and it would take almost an hour to get my huge army back.\n- Archery feels too difficult, a problem that seems to exist throughout most of the series.\n\nIt takes several gameplays and a good first blind run to really understand what to do, but when you figure it out it's quite fun and you can get pretty far. A lot of strategy is requires especially in later parts of the game. Choose your nation, abandon your nation. Be a bandit, be a merchant, be a warlord. Be whoever you want to bloody be!

It was designed by a Turkish Couple and, let's be honest, isn't the prettiest game in this generation. As the age old mantra "Never Judge a Book By It's Cover" states, however, Mount and Blade is much more than meets the eye. The game is a full simulation of a land dominated by several kingdoms, each one vyying for domination. In the center of the chaos is you; a lone sellsword whose only advantage is indomitable will and a (possible) noble background. The game allows you to do whatever you please; swear fealty to a king, ascend the ladder of nobility through marriage and political gaming, raise an army and siege castles and strongholds, compete in tournaments for honor and cash, or just spend your days ambushing caravans and living off of the spoils. There's no wrong way to play the game and no matter what method you choose, you'll have fun. The game also boasts a fantastic combat system and several mods.

Battles can grow very large with 32+ infantry and horse based units racing around in a chaotic bloody mess... with you experiencing the action from an "over the shoulder" perspective.  Strategy elements are managed via a large regional map from which you move your army from place to place accepting quests or following your own agenda.  "Heroes" in you army can be levelled up, like you, and you can purchase new gear or just use the loot from your kills.  Some will think the grafx are a bit primitive, but honestly you will not notice after landing a few headshots galloping across the field.  Also the game does not lead you down any particular path... you will need to explore a bit and just try things.  Eventually you won't be able to stop playing.

However, there is a better version (I know I am contraditing what I have already said but oh well!) it is called Mount & Blade Warband. It has improved animations, graphics and you can become KING of Calradia instead of some minor lord. Anyway, overall I will say AMAZING, become lord of Swadia (NOT RHODOKOS) and have fun on this game!

And with Mount & Blade TaleWorlds truly took a giant leap into the gaming world.\n\nMount & Blade is a excellent Open World Strategy RPG. Why the strange genre? Well, simply put I find it really hard to put it under just one label. It's open world in the way that you can travel anywhere whenever you want. It's a strategy game because you need to utilize your smarts and plan your army according to what enemy you face. Yet it's an RPG because of the levelling system and the different skills and specializations.\n\nBut to be honest this game is not worth it. If there is anything we should all know by now it is that Mount & Blade: Warband (A sequel of sorts) is exactly like it's predecessor except 100% better. So the reason I do not recommend this game is because I would strongly urge you to buy Warband instead for all the added features and because the map was greatly improved.\n\nSo don't get me wrong, this is a wonderful game but the sequel does everything this game can do but a hundred times better.","January 9, 2014","false","125.3"," 5 of 16 people (31%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","31","5","16","0","0"

The quests are completely dull and the entire story amounts to some exposition and the odd feature that your enemies prefer to capture you and take your stuff rather than simply kill you so that you won't take revenge in the future.\n\nIt's a good experiment in seeing how many fiefs or territory you can acquire, or whether you can outfit your guy in the most expensive armor before he bites the poverty bullet or you get too bored with it.\n\nI played with this game for many hours, which is to say, i experimented with it.  The combat is a mildly interesting wargame about conserving troop morale with the power of food, blocking and annoyingly aim-centric swinging that avoids combos and feels more like D&D due to how much easier it is to miss the opponent instead of actually hit them or get blocked by them (except when you're on foot), making sure you have enough horses and the right weather and time of day to optimize your travel speed across the map graphic, verbally telling off your follower NPCs for arguing with each other, and a bunch of other stuff that is really only interesting in concept rather than presentation or follow through.\n\nThe only real merit, is of course, mounted combat against forces on foot, cheesey castle sieges that aren't worth much after the first few (or 10 or so, if you're me), and the concept of the game itself.\n\nFINAL SCORE: 55.","November 30, 2012","false","69.7"," 1 of 8 people (13%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","13","1","8","0","0"

These glithes are very common, and almost make ranged weapons not worth bothering with,   I also wish I could choose my own custom faction and culture and lords so I can more easily own calaridia.   The quests are very repetitive, and move you in the direction of joining the factions too much.   The weapon balence for ranged weapons are broken in the way that the  ranged weapons are the most glitched aspect of the game, and need more ammunition to be worthwhile later in the game where the bigger battles take place.

I wanted to try something new. I figured what the heck...it's only 10 bucks. Best 10 bucks I've spent in a long time. The graphics are dated, but so is the game.\n\nI'm playing basically as a mercenary. Here's the skinny. Start off in the arena fighting in the cities. You'll get better at using your horse in the tournaments and weapons in the gladiator-style 40-man matches. It's a good way to practice and earn extra money. An important rule of thumb. Losing in the arena will not cost you anything. Losing a battle outside the cities...you're going to lose money and people if you've recruited any. Once you've gotten up some cash to spare upgrade your armor and whatever weapon you choose to use.\n\nI started out in the Vaegir Kingdom way up in the snow. Be sure to attack only looters to begin with. Usually they spawn about 5-10 at a time. I beat 10 of them by myself. I even took out 11 Swadian foot soldiers. Loot their stuff until your slots are full then head to the nearest city and sell everything except better gear for yourself.\n\nLittle by little as I recruited guys from the small towns I moved toward the Kindom of the Nords by the ocean. I started to drive off sea-raiders. Sea-raiders have the most expensive equipment. Wipe out enough of them and after a while your renown get you noticed by one of the lords. You'll get sent a notice asking if you'd like to become a vassal. You swear allegiance to him. He'll give you a fief. ( A town somewhere in the kingdom you run and collect taxes from.)\n\nFrom there keep an eye on your town, help it grow to make more money, keep chasing looters, raiders, etc...doing quests, and defending your kingdom. When things get to the point that raiders aren't poppng up as much you can always raid an enemy town. Carefuil! watch your map so you don't get ambushed. I tried to fight my way out once but I was ounumber by 40 Swadians who took me prisoner. They stole 6,000 in denars and about 19 of my party members. I went from 25 to 6. Plus, it really makes your enemy much more ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off. You make ALOT of money off of the spices and oils and tools you don't get from a battle.

Both defending and seiging are great fun.\n-Has many mods to fool around with.\n\nCons:\n-Quest system is a joke. There is tangible benefit to quests and they can all be ignored\n-Fuedal system is a joke. Again, no real benefit to interact with anyone other than to fight for or against them\n-Battle curve is broken. There are very easy encounters and very hard encounters. No middle ground at all.\n-Cannot create your own kingdom.\n-Village/fief management is tacked on, too slow to matter, and way below what it could be.\n-Top level gear is insanely expensive and completely random if it even appears, which can be frustrating.\n\n","September 20, 2014","true","357.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I had $10.00 and this game seemed interesting. After buying the game and installing it, I started a character and played. I really enjoyed pillaging villages, stealing their stuff, and recruiting their people, just so we could go pillage and fight some more.  Before I knew it I had amassed an army of 28 people. I played so much that I had amassed an army of 55, with 35 prisoners (including one lord). I sieged some castles and became a rebellious tyrant who guided an army of rescued farmers and peasants who became knights. We fought and fought until we owned quite a bit of land. I ruled over an army, and it felt good to be king. A ruthless, cruel, and destructive overlord. But an overlord nonetheless. But in my adventure I learned quite a bit of information.\n\n-Always go to war with armies of less than your own\n-Always be ready for dissapointment\n-Never get off of your horse\n-Don't be a jerk to armies of more than your own, you will be utterly destroyed and imprisoned.\n-Force peasants to give you items, sell the expensive ones, then buy some villagers.\n-Up your charisma a lot and add to your Leadership and Prisoner Management skills a lot, too.\n-Don't be a softie, be a ruthless tyrant who stomps on everyone, the latter being much more fun.\n-Be the king that you always wanted to be. It's your destiny, your choice. That is why M&B is so much fun.\n\nMy only problem with the game is how the gameplay can get tedious and boring at times. Once you've become the king and put some hours into the game, there isn't much left to do. But this can be solved by modding. I recommend getting some mods at Nexus, so the game won't get too boring.\n\nNonetheless, it is a great game and I recommend picking it up. I have not played Warband but if you are willing to pay $20.00 for a better looking, expanded version of the original, get Warband instead. You won't be dissapointed. 9/10.","April 19, 2015","true","31.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

From the start of your game, with nothing to your name but a rusted sword and tattered robes, you must carve your own story through the myraid friends and foes of a medival society. Much like the real dark ages, it can be a miserablee pain to get through for the unenlightened. Expect to save early and often, as the game pulls no punches. While this sounds terrible in text, it strangely isn't. If you get over the slow start of killing bandits and raiders with a rusty knife, you will find yourself leading vast armies against other feudal lords. The sword play and archery both feel great, if also prone to learning curves.\n\nThe simple graphics and open code mean there are many diffrent mods, for many diffrent things. A casual mod search will find you everytthing from game of thrones to star wars, so mount and blade willl never get old for the modding types. My personal favorite mods are thwe aformentioned star wars mod, solid and shade (a mod of necromancy and grimdark),  and warsword, a warhammer based mod which let's you play as a skeleton pirate.\n\nMount and blade is a game I would reccomend most people to try, but would understand if they quit. While it may hurt you sometimes, mount and blade only does it because it likes suffering. If you can return the pain though, I can gurentee hours of play time.","May 24, 2014","true","103.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Even if you hate medieval bow and sword games no problems there are some excellant mods that bring in muskets and pistols and even a mod that brings in the universe of star wars with blasters and lightsabers included.

I would liken it to a Game of Thrones in the sense that it has many factions that interact with each other in the game world and it's very political, however as the player you can align with any of them or just strike off on your own. It's set in a hard medieval world, with no magic or fantasy elements though that isn't a downside whatsoever.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/WoahgraphiquesdeNice/recommended/22100/","WoahgraphiquesdeNice","Van Froenheim","http://steamcommunity.com/id/WoahgraphiquesdeNice/","102 products in account","Mount & Blade is a bit more like the newer Elder Scrolls games in that, despite the fact that it has all the skills and stats that we come to expect from an RPG, all of the combat is real-time and the player is in control of the action.  As a result, combat feels a lot more fluid and less clunky then menu-based combat, and it feels like more varied experience as a result.  But to drone on about combat for too long would seem unfair, as that is only one small part of M&B's design.  The amount of variaty and choice the game presents you with is impressive.  It gives you this choice not through the means of dialoge options, (which are a part of the game, but are not a big feature) but by presenting you with varied ways of playing.  When a game can be just as fun playing as a merchant with a high trade skill instead of playing as a lord commanding warrior bands, you have done somthing very, very right.  Villiages provide more mild quests for farmers and traders, while kings and cities can offer up challenging and exciting quests for those looking for adventure.  The quests themselves, however, are generally pretty bland.  Most of them are randomly generated fetch/kill/deliver tasks.  I can't count on both hands how many times I ended up delivering a message or collecting taxes.  I would have liked for a few more scenarios for these quests, and perhaps even some non-random quests initiated by certain in-game events.  The presentation is somewhere in the middle of the scale.  While enviornments can be very impressive, characters are *just* realsitic enough to make thier creepy, empty-faced stares downright unsettling.  While I understand how out of place it would have felt, I would have perfered slightly more caricatured character models to keep them out of the uncanny valley.  Music, on the other hand, feels just right, and fits the fantasy world like a glove, even if it is mostly ambient.  But overall the asthetics make for a very nice fantasy atmosphere.\nMount and Blade is a game that is hard to get into at first due to a steep learning curve and lack of any good tutorials.  But once you finnaly get through the initial phase of confusion, you will find a true gem of a game underneath.","February 28, 2014","true","25.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's one of those games you can come back to after leaving for a while and it gets you addicted all over again.\n\nPros:\n- A diverse range of options for style of play. You can recruit a bunch of men and raid towns for gold, declare loyalty to a faction and work your way up the ranks, or you can level your trading skill and make money running a trade route.\n- Nice RPG leveling system that gives you a lot of options for your character. Additional characters added to the party can supplement your weaker skills\n- A good sized map with different types of enemies.\n- Simple combat system which is easy to learn (though it has its cons, which I will discuss).\n\n\nCons:\n- The AI for certain enemies. During tournaments they will routinely run themselves into walls and struggle to get away, leaving them as easy prey (or getting you stuck with them). In battles they typically just free for all as opposed to having any kind of organization.\n- Very difficult to command your forces and get them to do what you want\n- Graphics. I don't think it takes away from the game really, but the graphics leave a bit to be desired.\n\nOverall, I love this game and highly recommend it.

I'm not saying it's perfect; there's no storyline, no real missions, mediocre graphics, certain broken mechanics, and sometimes clunky combat. But damn if those qualms don't just fly out the window when you storm a city with 70 Nord Huscarls, decimating your enemies in less than 10 minutes, or sweeping by on your horse as you slash your way out of 5 to 1 odds, or slowing to a halt in front of the rising sun after the bloodbath. I've had this game for a while now, and I still get the urge to open it up every so often to check up on my fiefs, siege another castle, travel to my next destination. All this without mods. I highly recommend this game for pick up and play, and it is in my opinion far superior to the sequels that come after it, especially in terms of combat.","August 3, 2015","true","125.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The graphics in the version are fairly primive by todays standards, but they work as well as they need to.

I would liken it to a Game of Thrones in the sense that it has many factions that interact with each other in the game world and it's very political, however as the player you can align with any of them or just strike off on your own. It's set in a hard medieval world, with no magic or fantasy elements though that isn't a downside whatsoever. In this game you will forge your own path in a war torn land amidst clashing kingdoms, choose to be a lord, a bandit, a trader, a Robin-Hood like vigilante, or anything in between.

As a result, combat feels a lot more fluid and less clunky then menu-based combat, and it feels like more varied experience as a result.  But to drone on about combat for too long would seem unfair, as that is only one small part of M&B's design.  The amount of variaty and choice the game presents you with is impressive.  It gives you this choice not through the means of dialoge options, (which are a part of the game, but are not a big feature) but by presenting you with varied ways of playing.  When a game can be just as fun playing as a merchant with a high trade skill instead of playing as a lord commanding warrior bands, you have done somthing very, very right.  Villiages provide more mild quests for farmers and traders, while kings and cities can offer up challenging and exciting quests for those looking for adventure.  The quests themselves, however, are generally pretty bland.  Most of them are randomly generated fetch/kill/deliver tasks.  I can't count on both hands how many times I ended up delivering a message or collecting taxes.  I would have liked for a few more scenarios for these quests, and perhaps even some non-random quests initiated by certain in-game events.  The presentation is somewhere in the middle of the scale.  While enviornments can be very impressive, characters are *just* realsitic enough to make thier creepy, empty-faced stares downright unsettling.  While I understand how out of place it would have felt, I would have perfered slightly more caricatured character models to keep them out of the uncanny valley.  Music, on the other hand, feels just right, and fits the fantasy world like a glove, even if it is mostly ambient.  But overall the asthetics make for a very nice fantasy atmosphere.\nMount and Blade is a game that is hard to get into at first due to a steep learning curve and lack of any good tutorials.  But once you finnaly get through the initial phase of confusion, you will find a true gem of a game underneath.","February 28, 2014","true","25.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You level your character in the direction you want him to, be it an invincible Warrior, A man who leads a large band of fighters to battle, or one that uses cunning and wits to win, avoiding unnecessary risks, and strinking when the chnce is right.\nYou have fighting controls far superior to Skyrim or the like, you need to block, aim, avoid, and stay back, or you WILL die.\n\n-It's a Strategy game. You lead your Band into the fray, if possible on a location that favours your Classes of warriors (Plains for cavallerie, Mountains for ranged, rivers for Shock troops like housecarls). You command them where to go, Archers in position, Melee stay behind, Cavallerie Bait them close.\n\n-It's a game of Thrones. You will decide for one of the Leading Kings, and fight your way to Prestige and Honour and Wealth. Or you may choose to be a rogue, fighting for no man but yourself, ready to take on the five Kingdoms.\n\n\nIf you've been looking for a good mix of Strategy and RPG, this is it.","January 4, 2014","true","231.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If it's your kind of thing you can easily sink tons of hours into this series.","January 12, 2014","true","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Hawkez/recommended/22100/","Hawkez","Ernesto","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Hawkez/","443 products in account","Mount&Blade is an open-ended game in the same vein as Darklands or Elite. The\nplayer takes the role of the leader of a wandering band of soldiers and\nwarriors. The player then sets his or her own goals, whether they be of a\nmercantile, heroic, or tyrannical nature. To accomplish these goals, the\nplayer will engage in dynamic and deep combat using everything from throwing\ndaggers to military picks to ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ swords. Basically it is a snad box game that can be very realistic. You can LOSE battles. It is not just a button masher as far as combat goes, there is strategy and skill involved in the fighting. Graphics are ok as of version 1.011. I like that you can do whatever you want. Roam the land killing bandits, solo if oyu like. You can amass a huge force of soldiers. If a kingdom you are friends with is under siege, you cancome to the resque. Or you can take over villages, towns, kindoms castles.

However what really keeps me coming back to M&B is not the fighting/grinding but the realistic look of medieval villages and towns you see in this game.

This game is a sandbox game of doom. I have, on multiple occasions, sat at my computer playing this game for 16 hours (or more) in a single sitting, forgetting even to use the bathroom or eat. It's always a case of "Alright, I juts captured that castle, I need to get my troops back up to strength, then I can quit. Well, now that I have my troops up to strength, I bet I could take that other castle before I quit. Well, now that I've done that I should get my troops back up before I quit. Well, I did just take those two castles, I should just take this town real quick. Well, I need to get my troops back up to strength now, don't I?" And so on and so on until it's tomorrow and you have no idea what your life has become. Sword controls are intuitive (unlike the sequels, in which they are broken as hell!), they sandbox is addictive, everything about this game is fun. I wish the out-of-battle interactions were given more depth (which they did, I suppose, in the sequels? I wouldn't know, the in-battle controls are so horrible I've never made it more than two battles in before breaking my keyboard against my monitor and rage-quitting), but the core of the game is here, and that's what matters.","March 31, 2015","true","90.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I would liken it to a Game of Thrones in the sense that it has many factions that interact with each other in the game world and it's very political, however as the player you can align with any of them or just strike off on your own. It's set in a hard medieval world, with no magic or fantasy elements though that isn't a downside whatsoever. In this game you will forge your own path in a war torn land amidst clashing kingdoms, choose to be a lord, a bandit, a trader, a Robin-Hood like vigilante, or anything in between.

I've spent countless hours on it (only recently did I add it to Steam). It may look a bit dated by now, but the gameplay is still perfect, with one of the best medieval combat simulations I've ever encountered.\n\nI've read that Warband improves many of the features of the original, but for what I've seen there is one thing in which the original is superior, and that is the mods.\n\nThe game's mechanics are surprisingly adaptable to other eras and styles of play, and lots of peoples have put huge efforts in recreating them, so you can find recreations of viking invasions, the napoleonic wars, a western or even the Star Wars universe.\nI personally enjoyed "1866" (western), "1805 ii" (napoleonic wars) and "Rus XIII Ventury" the most, all of them almost standalone games for themselves.\n\nAll in all, a very nice game on its own that's been boosted tremendously by a huge load of community content.","March 8, 2015","true","138.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

From the start of your game, with nothing to your name but a rusted sword and tattered robes, you must carve your own story through the myraid friends and foes of a medival society. Much like the real dark ages, it can be a miserablee pain to get through for the unenlightened. Expect to save early and often, as the game pulls no punches. While this sounds terrible in text, it strangely isn't. If you get over the slow start of killing bandits and raiders with a rusty knife, you will find yourself leading vast armies against other feudal lords. The sword play and archery both feel great, if also prone to learning curves.\n\nThe simple graphics and open code mean there are many diffrent mods, for many diffrent things. A casual mod search will find you everytthing from game of thrones to star wars, so mount and blade willl never get old for the modding types. My personal favorite mods are thwe aformentioned star wars mod, solid and shade (a mod of necromancy and grimdark),  and warsword, a warhammer based mod which let's you play as a skeleton pirate.\n\nMount and blade is a game I would reccomend most people to try, but would understand if they quit. While it may hurt you sometimes, mount and blade only does it because it likes suffering. If you can return the pain though, I can gurentee hours of play time.","May 24, 2014","true","103.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

My whole life I have searched for a game such as this one. I recently returned to a life of intense gaming and it was easy to find. I got all of the M&B games in a package and I can't wait to try the other ones, I hear they're even MUCH better. HOW CAN IT GET BETTER THAN THIS?! I know that M&B fans will back me on this: I HAVE NEVER FELT SO MUCH PART OF A GAME BEFORE. I am speechless, this is like being in a knight's movie. This is EVERYTHING you will ever dream of when it comes to a realistic, respectful, professional and just an awesome awesome game. I know my review is not professional but I can't stay here and write this stuff while I can have another minute of M&B. SO much to do in this game. From what I understood so far, if you could do it as a knight in real life, you can do it in the game. This is the Ultimate Knight's Game! It's like a Medival Arma when it comes to the versatility of the game. Just frickin get it and you will not regret it.\n\nI made a poor merchant pay a toll to pass a road... He could have finished me in a minute but he didn't want any trouble! It was so realistic, something that would probably also happen in real life.

There are a couple of things that the original Mount & Blade did better.\n- More complex level design allows for more tactical combat, with the exception of the plethora of invisible walls within these levels, specifically at castles. If I'm going too close to a ledge, I'd prefer to fall off and learn the hard way, rather than being blocked from falling at all.\n- A condensed map makes campaigns move much quicker, and reduces a lot of the tedious running around, not to mention the fact that I can get to situations before they finish. Nothing quite angers me in Warband such as getting a notification for an event happening on the other side of the map, only to get there and find out I just missed it.\n\nThat being said, there are a few issues which I've noticed here that have been fixed in its sequel.\n- The journal does not keep a record of everything that Warband does.\n- Combat occasionally feels sloppy. Unresponsive controls and weird hit detection can make some fights, particularly melee, take too long.\n- Getting in and out of a merc contract or vassalage without ruining one's reputation (with both leaders and opposing factions) is extremely difficult.\n\nOf course, Warband ironed out these problems and added some graphical upgrades, a bigger map, and another faction. It improved on the original in almost every way, but I found it worth a few hours of my time to explore this game's superior castles, towns, and villages, at least until I ran into that problem of a gimped reputation system.","May 24, 2015","true","11.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It doesn't hold your hand much to be sure, and it's mechanics are obscure, but it's actually a pretty forgiving game. You can't die, and while your (unnamed) troops can die, I've had two total wipeouts in the early game and was able to recover quickly both times. The graphics in the version are fairly primive by todays standards, but they work as well as they need to. The AI could be better, and combat can be a bit clunky, but overall it's a great medievil (but not fantasy) sandbox game where you're free to run around and do things at your own pace.","January 1, 2014","true","135.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Fantastic musical score to this game, as well as a fairly balanced morality system implemented, and you'll always hear two sides to any argument.

Luckily I was pretty charismatic and plenty of Khagit Horseman were down to follow me in to battle. After a few skirmishes with bandits, I was asked to collect taxes for a Lord whom I wanted favor with - So I taxed the hell out of his city and ran off with the cash. With that money I used my Merchant skills to ♥♥♥♥, pillage and plunder little towns and then sell the illl gotten wares back to the province capitals for a small fortune.\n\nMy armys upkeep was about $700 weekly by day 15 and I was still handing out raises like a boss. Then it hit... War. I joined with a larger multi-lord army and conquered castle after castle until... Bam. Our meager 700 man fighting force was destroyed by the Nordic armies, numbering just over 800 men.... Everyone faught valiantly but it wasnt enough...  I was captured and held prisoner for days before escaping. Now, with my hidden stash of coins I head back to my home country to raise more armies of steppe horseman... I seek revenge,\n\n--> weak graphics but a fun fricking game. 10/10 - im addicted.","December 17, 2015","true","29.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
