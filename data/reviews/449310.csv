Reminds me of some of the good stuff that came out of Newgrounds back in the day, but smoother and with better production values. I've only beaten the first world so far but the challenge is already ramping up with new obstacles and mechanics. Levels are short with collectibles for replayability and there looks to be quite a lot of levels. If you're into simple but challenging games, I'd say it's worth a play.","May 6","true","0.4"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","0"

It is not a bad idea to add these characters as Super Meat Boy, Spelunky, and VVVVVV. The game is funny and challenging , and what is its beauty and the fact that you can compete with your friends in the world records table . The idea of ​​cool because textures dont hurt the eyes , it's very nice and I would like to add a level editor to make own levels, and any other players can join new maps and trying to finish they all. Sounds are pretty cool and I like its. Nice game! You must try to play this game.

It has a learning curve like a brick wall, mostly due to the single-button controls. Although the level design is quite clever, because of the fast pace of your gooey avatar and close perspective, almost every level feels like a horrible trap designed to ruin your day. Oddly enough, the best levels in the game are the very first and very last ones; they really feel like an effective tutorial and a final exam, respectively.\n\nSpeedrunning this game is a nightmare, and going for 100% completion is an exercise in masochism. Play this game for a weird challenge, but maybe don't play it for fun. Or, play it for fun, but never expect to beat it.\n\nOH RIGHT ALSO BE SURE TO SWITCH TO MANUAL WALLJUMPS ASAP. If you don't, you're likely to have a bad time.","May 7","true","2.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Time your jumps and save the world!!  The fate of our world depends on you!!! Will you just sit there and do nothing? Or will you stand up and say, "NO! Enough is enough!! It's about time I make a difference in this world and spam the f out of my A button!!!" JUMP JUMP JUMP!!! You can do it!!\nmaybe.. I actually don't really know if you can. I'm not here to give you false hope.\n\nOh your still here. Umm ya, so there are different difficulty levels and the maps are very well made. You will have to play through a few times until you get it right, which make it fun and challenging. Has a lot of replayability. Lots of things to unlock, which takes skill. Do you have skill?\nAre you sure?","May 8","true","2.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Bright, giant buttons?  Kids, we're dealing with a mobile game!\n\nSpunk and Moxie is a one-button platformer where you play as either Spunk or Moxie and play your way through many colorful and crazy levels.  Along the way you pick up different kinds of powerups, such as rocket fuel to boost you around, face common dangers, like hacksaws, and learn about the true strength of friendship.  Aww.\nThere really isn't much to say about the game.  As said before it is a port of a mobile game and probably was put on steam to boost sales.  There isn't anything wrong about the game, it's one of the better one-button games I've seen in a long time, it's just it is out of place on this platform.  That being said I had a blast playing it.  Very simple, yet fun and addictive, the perfect mobile combo.","May 10","true","0.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"
