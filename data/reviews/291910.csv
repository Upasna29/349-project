Firefighting. This game has some aspects of firefighting right, like water, water is important and keeping your equpiment in usable order is important. But it kinda tanked on everything else. I pulled 4 firefighting calls total on this, You can't crouch at all (Not sure whats with that) you are in turnout gear 24/7. Even when driving an ambulance. This game has no concept of actual fire scenes. It's essentially, you show up, pull out a section of hoseline and it is magically never ending and longer than than space and time itself. Then you just go rambo. No Incident Command, no assigned positions, nothing. Just Put water on Fire.\n2. Pre-Hospital Care. There is none. And what they tried to dress up and label as EMS in this game is a total joke. You literally drive the ambulance to the scene. Open your doors, pick up the patient (LITERALLY, NO BACKBOARD, NO C-COLLAR, YOU LITERALLY GRAB THEM WITH TWO HANDS AND CARRY THEM TO THE AMBULANCE....) and drive to the hospital. I even did this for a cyclist that got hit by a car...I mean come on..Thats EMS 101....\n3. AI. The NPCs that drive in the game are ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. I got sideswipped, t-boned, pushed off the road....Even with sirens and lights running...I mean seriously. Do people try and hit ambulances and fire engines in germany?\n\n\nI just want a real simulator....Not some gussied up excuse for a game.","May 22, 2014","false","1.1"," 332 of 401 people (83%) found this review helpful 31 people found this review funny","83","332","401","31","21"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Apokalupsis/recommended/291910/","Apokalupsis","✫ Aionion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Apokalupsis/","447 products in account","Buggy and extremely unpolished\n-------------------------------------------\n\nThis isn't intended to be a AAA title, I understand that. But I do expect a game where at least some measurable effort has been put into it. I expect a sim to actually simulate what it is said to be a sim of. I just didn't find that here, and instead, I found a seemingly incomplete, too early to be released attempt to be a firefighting sim. There are too many things wrong with the game that break the immersion of it feeling like a firefighting simulation.\n\nHad this been an early access game, I may have been able to see potential (and obviously, reviewed it differently). But because this is allegedly a complete game, it must be reviewed accordingly.\n\n=== THE GOOD ===\n\n\nThe premise. To be honest, that's about all I could find good with the game. I do find the genre (rescue simulator) interesting and fun, but the premise only takes us so far...the mechanics, gameplay, ambiance, etc. all must come together to help immerse the player in the experience. The game just doesn't do that.\n\n\n=== THE BAD ===\n\n\nAMBIENT SOUND ISSUES\n\n--engine sound cuts on and off despite there being no running vehicles nearby\n\n--door sound opening/closing whenever a person is nearby in the station (despite no doors opening/closing nearby)\n\n--no sound distance; all same level despite distance (with a couple exceptions of cars I found while I was walking on road, but even then, they cut in and out instead of properly fading in and out)\n\n--repeat voice loops (constant "good morning" and "Man, another shift that seems like it will never end." On the way back from the event, he kept repeating "I could really do with another hour of sleep."  I didn't know firefighters complained so much about their job.\n\n--roaring fire sound same for all fires, even an extremely small 1 box fire. That is, it doesn't matter if a building is on fire or if it is a shoebox, it's a roaring fire with the same sound effect 100% of the time\n\n\nGRAPHIC ISSUES\n\n--shading is bad on characters and other assets, more like smoke. It's difficult to describe, I've never seen a game do that before. I've changed the settings to see if it changes anything, it doesn't. I may post a screenshot to give an example.\n\n--reflections don't make sense. You can see reflections of things (like people for example) at angles, distances, and heights that are physically impossible (walking through the tutorial will give you an example of what I meant, but perhaps I should upload a screenshot to illustrate)\n\n--hose is non-existent once it is connected to water source. Nozzle appears in hand, but it is never connected to the hose. This is an immersion breaker.\n\n--reflections in vehicle rear view mirror are non-existent (except for sometimes, the top 1/4 of the rear view mirror displays the sky, nothing more)\n\n--100% of all civilian vehicles have darkest possible tint - can't see inside any vehicle\n\n\nBAD AI\n\n--walks randomly w/o meaning (back and forth down halls). They have no real tasks, they do nothing. They are just there to give the illusion that the facility is not empty, but it just doesn't work IMO.\n\n--will continue to walk into obstacles (like a desk). Eventually they seem to stop...but it takes a little while before they figure out they can't walk through the desk, it's weird.\n\n--colleagues do not actually do anything at all. They are there just for aesthetics (they do not put fires, they only appear to be doing so). The Steam home page advertises that your fellow firefighters do help you...but they don't. They don't do jack. The outcome of an event/emergency rests entirely with you...the other "people" there are just for show.\n\n\n=== THE UGLY ===\n\n\nGAMEPLAY\n\n--Tutorial only takes you through walkthrough of the department, it does not teach you the operations of the vehicles, nor does it tell you anything about any of the tools you use in putting out fires. There's a fair amount of different equipment, but absolutely no training on how to use them or what it connects to, etc.\n\nThe tutorial does absolutely nothing more than what an in-game map could do. That is no exaggeration. There is no benefit that the tut gives other than showing you where rooms are and in some rooms, what can be found there (a couple items here, coffee maker here, etc.).\n\n--Mouse sensitivity - despite having it on its lowest settings, it's still extremely sensitive, I had to use my control panel to adjust settings since game's settings are insufficient. 1st time I've ever had to do that in a game.\n\n--Physics...high pressure hose does not affect any entity in game except fire. 100% of all entities are there for aesthetics only (gas cans, boxes, trash, etc.). There are no movable objects.\n\n--Water...once it leaves the hose, it magically appears, never to be seen again. There is no water on the ground, no soaking walls, nothing. It leaves the hose and disppears into thin air.\n\n--cars take ZERO damage when running into them. They stop (at least), but nothing else happens. Obviously this is not a demolition sim....but I expected at some some sign of damage or some penalty. There's not a scratch on any vehicle, not even the truck I'm driving.\n\n--100% clipping when walking into cars (or them driving into you). They are "ghost cars" apparently.\n\n\n=== CONCLUSION ===\n\nThis is a game I'd expect to be in very early access. Currently, there are many early access games that are further along than this.   The idea behind the game (being a firefighter faced with different emergencies) is great, but the application fails miserably IMO.  Far too many bugs, immersion breaking issues, and lack of polish in just about every area imaginable.\n\nI had reasonable hopes for the game, but they were dashed by a poorly delivered product on almost every level possible.\n\nIMO, the game is worth around $5. I doubt that many players will get more than a few hours of game play from it as it is tedious, buggy, doesn't make sense at times, annoying (eg sounds), and has too many immersion breaking issues.","May 21, 2014","false","2.0"," 192 of 276 people (70%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","70","192","276","2","10"

Also I was able to hit my rack once, but it took me forever to find my rack.  So once I did, I got a call. I cant say I didnt enjoy it, but it could be a very fun game if improved upon.

Firstly mainly at car accidents, when they say oil has spilled sometimes there is no spilled oil which just makes me have to reset the whole game. It's really annoying.\n\nSecondly as there are fires such as when a car has caught on fire near and it's near rocks, garbage and benches, they are normally impossible to put out. I'm always dispointed as those type of operations sometime happen as my shift is nearly done and I'm happy and all that and then they are impossible, which you then have to reset or just ragequit.\n\nThirdly as I am rushing to a scene the car is really easy to slip which can lead to a flip over which then ends the whole operation.\n\nNow the last one is that sometimes the lights and siren aren't always appearing and working as usual. And mainly alot of features and things are mainly like copied. Inside the trucks it is un-releastic. I know that all these excailbur publishing games use the same technique. And I know that these are games base in Germany.\nPlease try to find a solution.\n\nOn the other hand, the game is really enjoyable and good with all these different operations. I really enjoy the different types of vehicles you get to use at each operation depending on your rank/skill level. This is probaly the best firefighting game they have made yet.","January 10, 2015","true","21.6"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","15","16","0","0"

Game-breaking bugs.\n\nOh gosh, where to start.\n\nThe landscape from the country to the city to even the fire house is really nicely designed.  The graphics, however, do not do it justice.  The graphic engine has to be at least 15 years old.  Maybe more.  Think "Ultima IX" days.  The textures on the fire apparatus especially were continually heavily pixellated.\n\nBeing a sim, there is more to do than just "squirt the wet stuff on the red stuff."  It's all nicely detailed.  Pity you don't have time to do much of it as the calls come in so fast.  Fortunately, the game seem to be so buggy that anytime I was low on oil or had some other mechanical problem, the game conveniently forgot about it after a scene change or even if I just left the vehicle and got in again!\n\nThe game can be quite merciless.  The tutorial (it doesn't deserve the word) teaches you nothing about playing the game.  It's just a tour of the firehouse.  You get no direction, no hands-on experience before your first call comes in.  Better would be some free time to explore and play around and then manually initiating the call.  There is a communications room after all.  The game also doesn't allow you to save your progress aside from autosaves.  Sometimes those autosaves are only at the beginning of the shift.  If you fail your mission at the end of the shift, well enjoy starting all over at the beginning of the shift.\n\nThe vehicles are difficult to handle, driving consisting of jerky movements.  It takes some getting used to, but after a couple times it gets easier.  The controls are awkward though, with the turn signals especially placed in strange locations on the keyboard.\n\nThe worst -- the absolute worst -- is the collision detection.  Good luck putting out fires.  You can sit there and pour a Biblical Flood of water onto the fire and it won't go out because it isn't detecting the water hitting the fire.\n\nDon't let's talk about the minimal effort put into the NPCs who wander the fire station or sit in your vehicle and spout the same two lines every 10 seconds.\n\nI've played several firefighter games.  Real Heroes Firefigher for the PC was the most recent.  (Another game with game-breaking bugs.)  Firefighters 2014 has to be one of the most interesting in concept.  But its execution was the worst I have ever seen.\n\nLaughingly, there is a choice on the main menu called "Credits".  I was surprised.  I can't imagine anyone wanting to be associated with this game.\n\nI love firefighting games.  This one especially caught my attention since it promised more detail.  Sadly, this was the worst game I have ever played.","December 21, 2014","false","15.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The gameplay is fun and most of the missions are good too. What sucks about it is that multiple times on multiple missions there are fires you cant put out. I have gone on youtube and to fourums and asked what you can do and the answer is nothing. The most commen response is to lower your graphics and resolution but even after you do that it still doesnt work. What is also bad about this game is that you unlock freeplay after you finish the campain which is bad because you cant beet the campain. I'm on the last mission and of course there are fires you cant put out and the only way to beat the mission is to save the people which you can't do because you will be burned and to put all of the fires which you cant do. I feel as if the company that made this game just didn't try with their horrible codeing. If your going to be lazy with your codeing atleast make freeplay unlocked so you can play what actually works. If they were to update their codeing so that ALL fires could be put out I would buy this game and write a good reveiw in a hartbeet.","November 28, 2014","false","20.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I mean doing 120 KMH around corners? one steady engine noise so no sound of acceleration, the water looks like a white smoke.. my god I could keep listing, if you happen to read these forums before buying.. save the money and spend it on a carton fire game, you will get better details and a less bugged game for the money.\n\nIt's a disgrace that Steam have this for sale.
