Yes IF it was the actual board game.  Because you pay once and you can play everyday forever.

That's just plain stupid.  IF this game where a one time pay and you own it for life, like say 19.99 (which I think is fair) I'd buy it in a heart beat.  But this game ending up being a pay-to-play is really the only reason it's got a bad rap.

To sum it up:\n\n1) The outcome of the battle tends to depend far too much on luck with dice rather than tactics, using terrain etc. The game tends at times to eb so random as to seem a glorified game of craps with toy soldiers in the background.\n2) Units are generic, you get almost no ww2 "chrome" in this game. Maries and Japanese infantry are the only exceptions that stand out.\n3) The business model is costly and player-unfriendly. Its not so much a F2P game, It feels more like a free extended demo.\n\nIN DETAIL:\n\nI played this with a friend - we are both old time wargamers (Advanced Third Reich, Squad Leader, Steel Panthers). We came to this expecting a beer&pretzels sort of "Baby's first Squad Leader" game.  I don't mean it in a derogatory manner -  in my opinion there is nothing wrong in making a simple or fast-play game on a popular topic, in this case tactical WW2 combat.\n\nMemoir 44 failed to deliver though. Yes, it is simple and fast. However it also lacks historical "chrome" and all the unit types feel far too generic (german tanks in Normandy have same stats as allied tanks etc).\n\nThe worst thing about it is that it is VERY random in combat outcomes. 9 out of 10 games both me and my friend walked away with the mutual conclusion that it was luck that was the decisive factor. In this game, your decisions, combat errors or tactical mistakes feel to have very little impact on the outcome - luck means much more.\n\nWe've had situations when infantry charged madly into the open field and shot to pieces an opposing infantry squad (same stats) that was defending a bunker. And no, this was not a point-blank assault on the bunker, we were shooting from many hexes away. I'm ok  with such situations happening "once in a blue moon", but in memoir 44 this happens all the time. Much more so than in most ww2 combat games we've seen - here everything depends on how the dice rolls - terrain and equipment don't seem to matter all that much. For me this is an absolute joykill.\n\nLet's get one last thing straight - calling this F2P is somewhat an exaggeration. The free part is more of an extended demo - you have a limited amount of gold that allows you to play the game a limited amount of times except for several small free scenarios. After you run out of gold, you will need to pay money for each scenario you play - multiplayer, single player, doesn't matter each time you will have to pay. This does become a probem as each scenario is small and these play fast. IMHO this is not a fun business model for me as a player.","December 30, 2014","false","1.9"," 26 of 33 people (79%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","79","26","33","3","4"

The game offers  two free scenarios. Playing further scenarios requires the use of Gold ingots. Creating an account gives you 50 for free. Scenarios cost from 2-3 gold ingots in my experience. After you go through your initial 50 you'll have to pay for more ingots. Packs of Ingots can be bought from their site and apparently from inside steam, but I can't get that to work. For 8$ (USD) you get the sergeant pack which comes with an 200 additional ingots. For 30$ you get the captain pack which comes with 1,000 ingots as well as access to their expert mode. Expert mode allows you to build custom scenarios. 30$ for this is way too high. Especially considering the simple 2-d graphics and uncomplicated game play. I would happily recommend this game if the captain pack was 10-15$.","January 6","false","14.2"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

There is no such thing as owning this game.  This is an arcade game where you need to keep pumping in the quarters to pay from now to eternity.

Games only take about 15 minutes, it's easy to learn, the manual's only a few pages, but gameplay's excellent... the sign of a great game. All you need to know about is movement, terrain restrictions and range modifiers and you're away. The visuals may put some people off (it's hexey, same as the boxed real-life version) but behind that it's a gem. Roll the dice, get symbols that match your target type to hit, destroy units or capture a location to get a victory point medal. Simple but effective.\nThe only trouble is the pay to play model, imo one of the nastiest money leaching and off-putting things to happen to gaming in the last 20 years. Once the 50 free gold runs out you're stuck with only 2 free maps. It may only work out as pennies to play a match but if  they'd sell it as a complete game, drop the "free" tag and the extra payments, it would've been great (and maybe had a larger number of long term players). It's happened with other boardgame conversions such as Ticket to Ride, Smallworld, Catan, Space Hulk, Talisman, so why not this too?\nUse the free bits then buy the boardgame until they come to their senses and release it as a full game where you can play to your heart's content without paying extra for the pleasure.","March 15, 2014","true","6.7"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","1"

This is the video game version of the real board game, and it is very fun. The problem is it charges you coins every time you play. The game is free and it gives you free coins to start out with, so you can play quite a few games before you run out. However, when you run out of coins, you have to pay money to continue playing. That really sucks.\n\nI would recommend this game if you are interested in the board game, or if you just want to kill some time playing a board game about WWII. Just know that, eventually, the game will want you to pay to keep playing it.
