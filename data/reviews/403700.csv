I like Zero Punctuation as well as the next person, but the fan factor isn't enough to carry the game. It doesn't work as a game in itself or as the clever anti-game it wants to be. It's slow, it's repetitive, and nothing really feels rewarding.

I am writing this review the day I bought the game (shortly after its release), and the game has crashed three times in 10 minutes of play, and I have a pretty good PC too that is far past the recommended specs (I'm a bit surprised this is such a sloppy port, considering Yahtzee's high standards, and yes, I know he himself was not involved with the game's development). There may be patches to come, and then the game will probably be somewhat fun, I may consider buying this again, and even making this review positive. However, until this game is fixed, I cannot recommend with a clear conscience and will be refunding the game. Also, $5 seems a bit high for a mobile port, don't a think?\n\nTL;DR Overpriced, kind of fun game that shouldn't be bought until it is both patched and on sale (or better yet, had it's price permanently lowered).","November 22, 2015","false","0.2"," 52 of 77 people (68%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","68","52","77","2","0"

The control system is simple, you control your character with the arrow key to the left or to the right. After a catch, the next level makes it a bit harder to catch the hat; for example more random things fall from the sky, and you don’t know what is the hat, if you don't pay attention you can catch a fridge. Between levels level you can play sometimes mini games, this especially can make the game funny. After you reached some milestones you can get a “gifts” for your character. The hats what you collect you can use for skins. The graphic style simple as simple as the game is. The sound and music is good.\n\nSo my verdict\n\n+mini games\n+good sounds and music\n+steam achievements and trading cards\n\n-if you play long time in a row can be tiresome\n-a bit high price\n\nSo this game does not want be more than what it is. It can be a good time killer if you want play something in your free minutes when you just want to turn your mind off.  Price for this game I think a bit high, but if it got a bigger discount or it's get included in a bundle you maybe can give a chance to it.\n\n7/10","December 6, 2015","true","6.7"," 28 of 41 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","28","41","0","0"

Y'see, the main gameplay gimmick, while enough for a mobile/flash game, isn't enough for a "proper" PC game. If I have access to Steam, I'd rather play something slightly more engaging.\n\nTo add insult to injury, this isn't that different from a FREE browser version. The HGH Edition adds ONE extra minigame and an amusing (for about ten minutes) bonus when you grind to 1500 hats in total. Is there more to it? There's a 0/7 on the desk right now, but I wasted (at the time of writing) three hours getting to the 1.5k mark and cannot force myself to be arsed about it.\n\nEDIT SQUARED: It's counting the number of rocket parts you collected. How do you collect them? By grinding hats to get one of two certain minigames, and you need to get the last rocket part during a certain one out of those two, to unlock a "finale" minigame. It lasts about thirty seconds, and due to the PC moving like someone lubed the floor, is no fun at all.\n\nPositives? Erm, it won't date fast, I presume. While sticking to the ZP aesthetic and random humour, the game tries to stand on its own and doesn't really require you to know the series that inspired it. Also, the soundtrack (well, the "collecting hats" tune and the "jRPG parody fight/finale minigame" tune) was catchy as hell.\n\n...yeah, I needed to dig deep to get that.\n\nWant to throw money at Yahtzee? Buy Consuming Shadow, it has more depth.","November 24, 2015","false","9.2"," 18 of 29 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","18","29","0","0"

Yahtzee's YouTube series "Zero Punctuation" has always been super entertaining but now he has brought us an equally-random experience that is now only interactive but endlessly unique every time around.  If you are a fan of his show, you will enjoy this game, definitely!\n\nYou get gifts for collecting enough hats, and most of the hats offer a unique twist on the gameplay.  Some were more pointless than others but the whole game experience is affected in at least some way by each present.\n\nThe gameplay is quite simple.  There is a hat falling and you have to stand under it.  With each hat you get, it gets harder and harder, with multiple objects falling at once (and you have to guess which is the hat and which is something less enjoyable like an anvil) and you advance if you guess correctly.  It can get very difficult when there are clones of yourself and you have to figure out which person you are controlling -- all in a matter of a few seconds.  If you are really bad, you will still gain presents as it retains however many points achieved.  High score is also tracked, but I love it how you will still get hats towards the ultimate prize even if you can only last through the first few stages.  I'm not entirely sure what the gift is if you get 1500 hats.  I guess I'll have to keep playing to find out!\n\nOverall, a great game, worth a buy.  It's not much more than that -- a minigames and funny commentary -- so if you are expecting something more than that maybe wait for a sale.

The game is quite simple being based offf yahtzee, and has the same saterical essence of Yahtzee, such as horrible path finding A.I, the telling of a player or a A.I, and leaving the robot to die! And even some fallout references if your'e into that sort of thing.\nnow play it for YaHTZEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! bOI!\n\n","March 11","true","0.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","33","1","3","2","0"

Do keep in mind the gameplay is quite repetitive mainly because it's the same thing every round ... you're trying to get under the falling hat. That's the objective, to catch the hat onto your head. However there are other elements to make it more amusing / challenging, such as clones of said character to distract you or other objects falling down at times (causing instant death).\n\nThen you have the Wizard which changes things up. Eventually, after so many rounds you get a gift to purchase cosmetics for your 'office'. Eventually you will unlock minigames that are the highlight of the game itself. I honestly feel if you're a fan of Yahtzee by any means, you'll get a kick out of this game. If you're not, then you'll find it to be a chore after 20 minutes if not less.\n\nBut for $4 dollars, it's a pretty good game. I enjoyed it, and the references scattered about (only fans will pick them up). But do be warned, if you play after an hour and something happens, you'll be confused as what to do next. Try the wheels mini game, then you'll understand what i'm talking about.","November 25, 2015","true","3.7"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","2"

Combining both challenging and fun gameplay, Hatfall is sure to leave you on your toes.\n\nTo explain on this a bit, let's talk about the gameplay. You play as Yahtzee (famous from Zero Punctuation) who has lost his hat. Whilst this may not sound like something interesting, believe me it's quite fun. It combines a mechanic found often in mobile games, namely short and quick reaction gameplay. Your task is to get Yahtzee his nice looking hat back. Every 25 hats you get to choose between "gifts" indicated by the progress bar on the sections below the level. Said gifts, when unlocked, frequently permit a minigame to be unlocked: e.g. Unlocking Hatsassin's Creed causes you to be dropped of in a clear parody of a dating sim.\n\nThe game itself doesn't prefer to play nice on you. Instead it favors to downright insult the player. In-between level sections and a second before the level begins, you get a pop-up message. These message always involve doing something with a hat. If you succeed, you are greeted with another popup message, which always involves boosting Yahtzee's massive ego or make more fun about hats. But those things are insulting to the player who doesn't know what Zero Punctuation is: A webshow about reviewing Video Games on their negative points. Of course the game was going to be insulting.\n\nAlthough I don't know what the 1500 hat collective does yet, it will probably involve Yahtzee laughing at me for wasting my time on this great addictive game.","November 20, 2015","true","5.7"," 8 of 20 people (40%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","40","8","20","3","0"
