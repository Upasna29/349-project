I cant in all honesty recommend the game at the moment . Fix the enemy AI and it would be a really good shooter.","December 2, 2014","false","0.1"," 22 of 26 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","22","26","0","0"

This ain't that substitute. This feels more like Developer's First Shmup, taking Asteroids and barely improving on it. The controls feel very off, and the enemy AI is downright terrible, there's no intelligence involved whatsoever, things just fly directly at you and hover on you once they get there. I don't normally knock spelling and grammar in games, since I know developers can come from anywhere in the world, but this one is particularly bad on that front. Space Pirates and Zombies or Ring Runner would definitely be the better games in this style to go with.","November 5, 2014","false","0.2"," 23 of 35 people (66%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","66","23","35","0","0"

The enemies stick to your ship like your ship is a magnet and they just overwhelm you. There is no escaping them, then you're dead.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nightsky_official/recommended/326990/","nightsky_official","Nightsky","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nightsky_official/","60 products in account","Product received for free\n\nI got this game from the Otakumaker #11 Bundle so i guess it counts as "free game".\n____________________\n\nFirst i wasn't sure about the game, it looked very odd to me and based on the reviews i thought it's going to be garbage (Nothing against the devs) The first minutes of gameplay were a bit boring because i only had a few weapons but later on it became quite intense and with like 10 weapons in the inventory it became fun to play. Especially the Disco-Gun which made me laugh.\n\n==Gameplay==\nNot the best gameplay i've ever seen because the controls are quite tricky but after a while you learn how this game works and it becomes easier for you to dodge and aim at enemies. The enemies are also very nice. There are quite a few different enemies, from normal tackling melee enemies up to pulling scorpion enemies there is a large variety of enemies.\n\n==Graphics==\nYou cannot really compare the graphics with other games, but it's nice to look at them especially in the later levels. 5 Stages, each stage using the same map but due to different locations and angles the background always changes and becomes more awesome over time. Generally most of the weapons are great designed. "Disco Gun" is one of them :P\n\n==Great progression system==\nChose between Technological and Organic, each of them giving you access to a specific set of weapons and abilities. This is great due to different gameplay tactics and progression tactic. 30 Perks pretty much buff your entire ship or the environment around you, as example "Summon" spawns sometimes a black hole that fires a laser to a random enemy, instantly killing it.\n\n==WEAPONS!==\nAs mentioned already, there are a lot of unique weapons. Each of them offers something special. I don't want to spoil the special guns so let me stay with the regular weapons. Laser as example is a - you guessed it - laser weapon that fires regular low damage bullets to your enemies. Magnetic gun however is more of a shotgun type, Singularity gun is a wave cannon with piercing effect. And there are so many more weapon, from heavy but long recharging weapons up to unique weapons like the Disco-Gun which makes everyone dance... literally.\n\nNegative:\nThe third boss is so annoying -_-\n\nOther than that, great game!\n\nRecommended? Yeah, if it is on sale or within a bundle. Maybe not on it's full price.\n\nPlayed 10 hours total, but offline.","June 6","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
