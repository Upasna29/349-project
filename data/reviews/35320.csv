The controls are basic, and feel great. Easy to pickup, play and know what you're doing. Left and right to steer, gas to go forward, brake is also reverse and turbo to boost forward. The longer you hold the turbo, the faster you go. After time the turbo will regenerate itself. The game is full of insane jumps and you only go one direction in the air. So even a small jump can send you flying straight and costing you valuable seconds. If you wreck your vehicle or flip it, there's a respawn button that gives you full turbo boost to get you back into the action. There is even a mini map, a full sized map and an 8 way camera to look left, right and behind you. Its a simple game anyone can quickly master. Adults, children, drunks at an arcade. There are a lot of vehicles to unlock in four categories. 4x4, SUVs, pickups, trucks (like dump trucks and semmis), and extreme vehicles with giant tires.\n\nThis game would feel at home in an arcade, but there are so many cups with a variety of events that you can play for dozens of hours without playing the same event twice. The game has 10 event types spread out over an overwhelming 150 events on 20 maps in dozens of cups. These 10 event types are where the game shines. This variety kept me engaged.\n\nYou have the standard race type that has you racing through checkpoints over two or three laps. Then there's the knockout that eliminates the vehicle in last place every 30 seconds. Jamboree starts the vehicles facing one another and green lights a random gate out of several, sending vehicles on a mad dash to go through it. This accumulates points, and the first to lets say 100 wins. The racers are quick to react and turn without hesitation. You have a strategy to waste your boost getting to the current gate or wait for the next random gate to go for it. Gate hunt that has 30 gates and the one that passes through the most gates wins the event. Pahthunter forces vehicles to go through all 30 gates. The first one through them all is the winner. You make your own path and do them in the order you want to. Zone Patrol has you capturing gates. The last person through a gate, gets a point for each second that gate is owned. The first to 300 or so points gets declared the winner.\n\nCapture the Flag has you racing to get a flag and hold onto it with each second adding a point to your score. The first to 100 wins. You can get 10 points or so for driving through green light gates with the flag. Its like Jamboree, but only one driver can get the extra points. I found this event fun, just playing keep away from the other drivers. Here's the thing though, having a GIANT flag on top of your vehicle means it rolls easy. So keep it straight, no sharp turns. If you ram someone with the flag, you get the flag, as long as they've held it for a second. This results in some big pile ups.\n\nNow we have the difficult event types. The ones that stand out as challenges from the fun of the others. Greed will drop bronze, silver and gold boxes from the sky. You can see them on your mini map and giant lights leading up to the sky. They're each worth 5, 10 and 15 points. The first to 100 is the winner. Retrieve the flag has the pack first driving to the flag then taking it back to the big home base for points up to 100 or so. Pursuit is the final and most dreaded event type. You need to follow a helicopter and stay in its spotlight with each second in the spotlight giving you a point. Since its a helicopter, it can turn on a dime. At least the chopper sticks to a set pattern and never deviates. These pursuits are marathons that have lasted up to 30 minutes.\n\nPursuits manage to accentuate the intelligence of the other drivers. They can adapt quicker than I could after 16 hours, yet they seemed to intentionally let me catch up. I'd be in last place with no points and the leader would have 99 points. Instead of simply winning and forcing me to restart... its as if the game then let the 2nd - 5th place vehicles catch up points wise as I did. Sure when I got up to third place in points, the game gave me a struggle, but its the fact that it let me still feel like I have a chance. It still made it seem like it was struggling to win and wasn't just stopped like a dog waiting for you to chase it.\n\nEven if the game has only 20 maps spread out across 4 continents (North America, Africa, Eurasia and Antarctica), it felt like with the constantly changing objectives, each objective was like a fresh route. Since this is off road racing, these aren't just courses, these are maps and you can roam freely and take any path you want to make it through the next checkpoint or objective. Go over a bridge, dive into a gorge, go under the bridge, go up an 80 degree canyon wall with little effort. You can't get knocked off course, because the entire map is a course. In fact, the entire map loops. So if you captured the flag with the pack chasing you, don't turn around, keep going to the east, you'll pop out on the west half of the map still going east. Its seamless and a beautiful way of not having invisible walls or borders.\n\nBecause these are realistic environments, the game has limited resources when it comes to diversity with only desert, dirt, grass and arctic tundra. It still felt like they made each map feel unique through gimmicks here and there. A lumbermill, a low riverbed with a broken skyway road over it, a desert ghost town, a railroad with an engine that will ram and destroy vehicles, a beach, a swamp, a desert oasis with rhinos running around, and a freighter stuck in ice are a few examples of the gimmicks. There are even a few challenging maps that have blinding thunder storms, but luckily gates are always lit up on screen and marked on your mini map.\n\nThere is a quick race mode and a career mode that spans across four championships. Competitors challenge for beginners, World Tour for the first half of the game. Manufacturers contest has you playing and competing against vehicles of a specific category. Completing each cup and category gives you permanent boosts in one are for all vehicles. For those that like a challenge, there is the Pro Club for the second half of the game. This championship when you're done with most everything else. The difficulty is amped up. Sixteen hours in, I've only just completed a few of the cups in the Pro Club. Each championship has several cups. Each cup has between four to seven events that are themed for the most part. Like Africa, Hostile Weather or Capture the Flag.\n\nWhen you start a career, you select a faceless gender and then one of three crews that give you a bonus to speed, boost or handling. You're given an SUV. Every event that you place in the top 3 unlocks a new event or two and gives you cash to upgrade your vehicle's body, engine or suspension. Each of these three upgrades will increase a few different stats for the vehicle's speed, acceleration, booster, off-road and durability. You can easily see the stats to compare vehicles. Some events even give you a skin credit to unlock a new skin from two extras per vehicle. The smaller vehicles slow to a crawl in the water, while the big ones just motor on through. Big vehicles are top heavy and can roll over easier to cost you time. I would have preferred that larger vehicles can ram through things for the cool factor, but even the small 4x4s can ram down a telephone pole.\n\nThere is a multiplayer mode, but since this game was released in 2012, there don't seem to be any servers. You can easily make your own or play local co-op. With everything said, four hours into the game, it crashed and I lost my save file. It only happened once, but its a testament to the game that I just kept right on playing.","January 15, 2015","true","17.0"," 34 of 36 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","34","36","0","0"

While not insanely successful (as far as i know), it was a fun off-road arcade racer with lots of game modes and tons of maps and cars to choose from. (It even had a cop car and a hover-craft sci-fi racer thingy)\n\nInsane 2 continues this line, being far from a realistic racing game, but immensely fun, if you don't take it too serious. Expect lots of jumps and brutal crashes. The game has quite a few cars, maps and racing modes (from classic racing to capture the flag).\n\nGameplay-wise, Insane 2 isn't too difficult. The AI has some dumb moments, but luckily, these are relatively few and far-between. The Physics can seem strange to someone expecting a simulator, but their do their job. Ice and mud will make you glide around, for example. One annoying thing is, that the car will turn into rubber when you're carrying the flag (during CTF and RTF games). While the cars do take damage, it seems mostly cosmetic until the car breaks down completely, when a reset will fix it and bring you right back into the action.\n\nThe game looks very satisfying and seems well optimized, running very well even on mid and low-end machines. Graphics-wise there's very little to complain about, really.\n\nI can't really say much about the multiplayer, as i have yet to test it.\n\nAll in all, the game is well worth your time, IF you don't expect a realistic racing game and if you enjoy over the top races.\nProbably the biggest downside, is the current price on Steam.

That would be great if they hadn't also removed features. If you're looking for a cheap, reasonably enjoyable offroad arcade racing game, Insane 2 is a good option when you find it on sale. (I got it for $1 on BundleStars) I can't recommend paying the full price, under almost any circumstances. See why below.\n\nHere's what you should know:\nYou race in tournaments, you get points to upgrade cars, you unlock cars, you race some more.\nEach race may take you a couple of tries to beat while you learn the track.\nThe cars have different liveries, but you won't care much because none of them are interesting.\nThe AI seems to value your loss more than its own victory, so it'll sacrifice itself to take you out. From memory, this seems to be the same AI from 1nsane.\nYou can miss checkpoints, which means you'll have to backtrack if you got bounced around one. This combined with the kamikaze AI can sometimes be frustrating.\nThere're no licensed cars or brands.\nThis game has full controller support (at least for the wireless 360 controller) though it isn't listed on the Steam page.\n\nIf you played the first game I have bad news for you: The free roam mode is gone, there is no mod support, and there are no available mods. So all those fond memories of driving around the open areas trying to do barrel rolls, finding new skins online, discovering that you could make a new area with just a black and white elevation map, and playing as a gnu on wheels are going to have to stay memories. For a lot of people this is a good reason to skip this game, and I can't disagree. If you can see past that though, you'll still enjoy the racing.\n\nInsane 2's distinguishing features are few. It is an offroad racing game and very little more than that. It doesn't have the simulator-esque realism of DiRT and it doesn't have the grand scale tracks and weather of Fuel but it's a fun, arcadey offroad racer.","July 30, 2014","true","0.7"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zerathos/recommended/35320/","zerathos","Locke","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zerathos/","1102 products in account","Not the highest budget, best looking, or most fun handling racing game ever made, for sure, but fairly enjoyable nonetheless. Personally I've never been a fan of games that drift by turning sharper, as opposed to using a button, as it feels like you have less control. However, this game manages to still feel controllable most of the time, despite not feeling as responsive as a game like Sonic & SEGA All Stars Racing Transformed (which personally has my favorite driving mechanics of any racing game).\n\nI have yet to figure out if there's anything I can do to gain boost meter or if it just refills over time. The boosting doesn't always feel as fast as I'd like, but it changes handling interestingly and is frequently refilled, which is nice. I also haven't played many off-road racing games, so this is a nice change of pace, with lots of bumps and such along the way that can challenge you and send you flying, which is quite fun. Speaking of, the car models, designed to look off-roady, are a nice change of pace from the kinds of racing games I usually play. The AI likes to PIT you and force you into obstacles, but trying to return the favor is more difficult than it seems it should be.\n\nIf you're a fan of racing games and don't mind a mediocre-but-competent fun little racing game, Insane 2 isn't a bad choice. I wouldn't spend more than $5-10 on it.","December 3, 2013","true","2.6"," 13 of 19 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","13","19","0","0"

I'm not really a fan of racing games as a rule, but this one really appeals to me because of it's really simple but addictive gameplay.\n\nInsane 2 has one of the best atmospheres I've encountered in a racing game and has a smart AI, plenty of game modes, vehicles and tracks to choose from giving you plenty of hours of play, the graphics are also pretty impressive for an arcade racer. Throw a ton of achievements into the mix and you have a near-perfect racing game. While the physics aren't exactly phenomenal, they're a lot better than most other games of the same style (P.A.M. for example), it's just a shame that the online community for this game is almost non-existent now.\n\nSo if you like arcade racers then you should definitely pick this one up for your collection when it hits the sales.

Practice makes perfect.\n• Sometimes it seems like it's impossible to catch up to the lead car, but again, the more you play, the better you get.\n• Even though there are a selection of cars, you may only find yourself using 4 or so different ones to be in to win.\n• Multiplayer appears dead.\n\nI think a reasonable playthrough could be done in just over 10 hours.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BarbaricAvatar/recommended/35320/","BarbaricAvatar","BarbaricAvatar","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BarbaricAvatar/","204 products in account","Short version: Insane 2 is the best game i've played in a long time, but it's not without stupid easily-fixed flaws. It could have been perfect and recommendable to anyone were it not for these issues. As it is it's fantastic but beware of control/viewpoint frustrations.\n\n\nLonger version:\nIt's amazing but annoying at the same time. Obviously a lot of effort has gone into making the game not only fun but also faithful to the predecessor and the developers have succeeded on both counts. Yet there are a handful of problems which smell of either corner-cutting or being ignorant to gamers who like to play games a certain way.\n\n1st problem: (This one will be bigger to some than others) The gamepad controls are non-configurable. Yes it'll let you use a gamepad, no it won't let you set the controls how you like them. Consequently it maps accelerate/brake to the trigger buttons, which may be the way some people like it but i think this method of controlling speed is dumb. I usually use the right analogue stick, or a face-button if this function is not available. But as i said the game won't let you remap anything. So immediately i'm forced to play on keyboard because i just can't handle stupid controls. Perversely the game DOES let you configure the keyboard controls, so at least in that regard you can have it how you like. (fyi = az,.)\n\n2nd problem: There's a choice of only 2 views and neither of them are on-car. Yep, for the first time in a long time a racing game offers no 1st person viewpoint; all you get is a 3rd person view and a slightly zoomed-out 3rd person view, both of which are irritating because they don't rotate the view consistantly to the direction the car is facing. It's bizarre, surely a 1st person view is easier to program than a 3rd person view, yet for reasons that will remain a mystery Targem decided to not to include one. Consequently you'll run into a lot of viewpoint issues particularly during the flag & pursuit events.\n\n3rd problem: This is perhaps a personal preference rather than an arguable flaw as such. The "King of the Hill" mode from the first game has been replaced by "Pursuit", this is a hateful mode and is poorly recognised with many anti-player features which just make it more irritating than it needed to be. The idea is fairly simple; a helicopter will fly a scripted path with a searchlight directly underneath it, the player scores points by staying in the searchlight. It's fine as an idea but i do wish the developers had allowed more people to test the mode before including it in the game, it's riddled with problems. Firstly, most of the cars at your disposal (especially in the early stages of the game) simply aren't fast enough to keep up with the helicopter, how the AI cars manage it is anyone's guess (they cheat; is the answer). Secondly, when  you get bumped and fall behind you'll need to catch up sharpish which means relying on your nitro boost. But this will run out just before you catch up and then takes so long to recharge that you've fallen behind again. What would've immeasurably improved this mode would've been to give everyone infinite boost. Another annoyance is that the helicopter will change direction without warning and on some of the tracks you have to do several laps just to learn the route and hope the cheating AI doesn't win before you do so. Again; a small fix would've been to have the chevron in the spotlight pointing the direction that the heli's going to take 1 or 2 seconds in advance.\nAs it is the game's shipped with a stupid mode that requires many many attempts (and a boatload of luck) to beat, while the rest of the modes can be challenging but always feel possible.\n\nAlso regarding modes: The game makes you wait for 4 or 5 championships before giving you a Pathfinder game to play, this mode was always popular in the original game and one of the main selling points, yet I2 doesn't provide you with this fun until you're 40% of the way through. If all the Pursuit maps were replaced with Pathfinder/Gatehunt/Jamboree maps then i'd have been a bit more forgiving toward the game.\n\nThose are really the main problems that mark Insane 2 down for me, i love the game and heartily recommend it but it does really get on my tips from time to time. It's a worthy follow-up to one of my all-time favourite games, it looks fantastic, it's well optimised to run on lower-end systems, the racing is close and exciting, there are tons of events and a good variety of vehicles. I just wish more attention had been paid in certain areas. 8.5/10\n\n\nPS: There's also no speedo, even though the stats say a car is faster there's no guarantee that it actually is, especially when they all jump the same distances.\nPPS: Multiplayer: There were no games available on 3 seperate attempts to play. And i created a server which sat empty with no one joining for over an hour. Multiplayer is only for those who have friends who also play.\n","February 8","true","15.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The original was a pioneer of off-road demo-derby racing that gave the player a feature-rich depth of control like having to customize your suspension and gear ratios to suit the environment and type of competition your next game would be in,  and the procedual damage that would sometimes smash your car into a twisted mess- but perhaps just not enough to prevent you from limping across the finish-line for the win. This is more like mario cart than 1nSANE. It's a cliche booster-gauge 'win points to buy upgrades' racer that has no business posing as a successor to 1nSANE. There isn't even a manual transmission option anymore. And, I could have missed it, but in the couple hours I've spent in the game so far, I didn't see a custom map utility- which was one of the coolest things about 1nSANE.\n\nEven if not associated wth the Codemasters masterpiece, this is not a very good racing game. It's half-racer, half-demolition derby, and not enough to be successful at either. Go play Hydro Thunder.

I'd say that even Super Mario Kart is a more complex and challenging racing game than this. I can see why people like it, it'd be right at home in an arcade and it's passable for that.

The graphics are pretty good and it controls well, and sounds are good. However it just does not hold a torch to a far superior game like Dirt 3 or Grid 2. It is tied with Shoot Many Robots for having the most mind bendingly generic awful rock music that makes me want to tear my ears off and throw them in a piranha tank, but I suppose that can be fixed at my own disposal by turning off in-game music (which hopefully it allows) and playing my own tunes in Windows media player. The worst complaint I have about the game is that even if you run a perfect race you usually still only finish first ahead of the second place car by a few seconds or less.\n\nIf you want the best off-road racing game, buy Dirt 3.

However when you take a jump and sudenly go from first to last then can't recover because all the other cars are so evenly matched its not the greatest feeling while playing solo, if that happend in coop i could understand, but take a hint guys in solo I'm the star of the show make me feel like it.

Besides the traditional time trial mode, the game features 9 other game modes, including the popular “Capture the flag”, “Gate hunt” and “Pathfinder”, as well as some new competitions, such as bonus hunting, territory control and helicopter pursuit. All of these modes are also available in multiplayer, with up to eight players participating simultaneously.\n\nMore than one hundred and fifty races combined into championships and cup competitions take place in Europe, America, Africa and the Antarctic. The game has an enormous variety of long distance tracks: sand and snowy deserts, high-speed roads and impassable cross-country paths, African beaches and deserted Antarctic stations.\n\nThe game features 18 vehicles of different classes, from buggies to monstrous “Bigfoots”, as well as an additional prototype class. Rating points won in the races can be used to upgrade any of the vehicles, from a selection of 15 running gear, body or engine upgrade alternatives. Each vehicle is furnished with a detailed destruction system. Reaching the end of a course without suffering any losses is an enormous challenge that only a select few are able to accomplish. The opponents, who constantly create extreme situations, aren’t the only danger: players also need to watch out for railway crossings, heavy tanker trucks and even lightning in stormy weather.","November 19, 2013","true","250.8"," 5 of 18 people (28%) found this review helpful","28","5","18","0","0"

However for people looking for more actual racing you might want to skip it unless you like brawling with cars. It gets frustrating for someone looking for just good solid racing to get a mix of racing, gate hunting, gate claiming, capture the flag, return the flag, Greed, and persuit. On a side note I love capture the flag it's like a moving demolition derby track. Pretty fun. On the hate I HATE I STRAIGHT HATE PERSUIT oh and GREED. Both are annoying and seem to last ten times longer than you could ever want.\n\nHowever on giving it a mix of ideas and good wrecking and monster trucks and all that good crash smash fun. I could recommend it.\n\nAs a bonus warning the maps loop they seem bigger cause your circling or portalling right back to the same areas. The opponents use this to crazy advantage in certain game modes like Greed that makes you want to put your fist through your screen. Just a heads up. However if your a decent driver you should be able to one up them most of the time. I got gold on most of the attempts first try.

Very confused there aren't tons of people playing this online as the type of gameplay modes this game has lend themselves perfectly to a ton of multiplayer fun. The single player game is awesome though and will keep you occupied for a good length of time, with you also coming back for more time and time again due to it being a great racing game.\n\nHighly recommended if the multiplayer online isn't overly important to you.","March 23, 2014","true","16.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A nice hidden gem of a game with gameplay akin to the popular motorstorm series that is great fun to play online with friends. It has enough content with a variety of tracks, cars to unlock and game modes to keep you entertained, however it can get a little repetetive. Due to this and the fact that the controls can be a little bit sketchy at times I would NOT PAY STEAMS CURRENT ASKING PRICE. For a couple of pounds/dollars however this is a great little game that I would highly reccomend.","April 6, 2015","true","10.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Similar to PS MotorStorm but IMHO more fun since you have more free roaming and game types than in MotorStorm. Also I am using XBoxOne controller which works like a charm and it is highly recommended.\n\n10/10\n\nHave fun!","January 11, 2015","true","5.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I was a huge fan of 1nsane, especially the bugs and gameplay, similiar to Smuggler's Run. Insane II stays true to the original with updated graphics. Still the same exhilirating racing, still the brutal fighting to stay in control of the game, and still the hilarious viewpoints of your rivals flying over you as they roll to a crash.

Capture the flag, gate hunt, pathfinder, knockout and more. MadMax style action where 6 cars are heading toward the flag or gate from different directions at full speed.\n* Map is huge tile repeated infinitely. You can drive forever without hitting map edge. Awesome idea that complements game modes - target can be approached from different angle. For example if way east to the base is crowded with opponents you can return flag by going to the west, north or south. Brilliant idea.\n\nCons:\n* Damage model is very disappointing. Car only loses panels and accessories without drive capability being affected. Only big hits result in "car broken" state where all wheels fall off (even when car falls on roof!) and car must be repaired. This is huge downgrade when compared to first 1nsane game where whole car frame could be deformed and watching out not to cripple the car was essential to win.\n* Cars do not show advantage on given maps/tracks. Buggy class should be dune master while monster class should dominate crazy jumps. Instead every race can be won in random car.\n\nI had a good time playing this game. Thanks!\n\nAfter 1NSANE and IN2ANE I'm waiting now for INSAN3 (multiplatform please)!","July 19, 2015","true","17.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
