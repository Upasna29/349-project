I have to admit I didn't expect too much, but it kept me playing for a few hours. My opinion, after playing it, is that Bullshot is a real bargain.\n\nThe pros:\nA lot of references and tributes to old arcade games and movies (You break a car like in 'Street Fighter', ride a bike like in 'Sly Spy', and in the trailer I saw you'll have to kill a heart like in 'Contra'. This can't be just coincidence. ).\nFranky charging at the enemies. (Best melee attack ever!! XD )\nGood gameplay.\nTrading cards are awesome!! XD\nMusic (I really liked this one!!).\nLess than 1$ (The price raised recently, it's still a cheap one, anyway).\nGreat developer support and the updates keep a good pace.\n\nThe cons:\nIt looks like it's a little short at this moment. Maybe it's not a real con, as developers say it will have 8 or 10 levels (it has 3 plus 3 bonus right now). (The game is frequently updated and developers are adding levels almost every week. It has 6 plus 3 bonus now).\nTook a little to find out how to play (there's a help image showing the controls but it's "hidden" in the options).\nDifficulty is maybe too high at some points. I'm also not sure if it's really bad, as it makes Bullshot look more like the old arcade games.\nThe 'retro TV filter'. It looks funny for a while, but fortunately you can turn it off (and the game looks better without it).","April 7","true","4.6"," 24 of 31 people (77%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","77","24","31","3","0"

The graphical options are cute and gameplay is fairly typical of traidtional side scrollers--with mouse aiming. Play is fun, though there is a limitation in the raw number of levels-but then it is still an early access release.\n\nMy greatest "complaint" is the jump mechanic. I find the game is vertically unforgiving, with some areas being missed if one drops too low too quickly.\n\nThe collectable mechanic is typical of many side-scrollers, though I have found some "wall clipping" issues (the sewer level for one turtle for example) which have forced a restart of the level--though the collectable was still counted.\n\nMid-level save flags, reminicient of Mario, are helpful, however, all stockpiled weapons are typically deleted--which can make for some difficulties if the level is new to the player.\n\nWeapon options are still thin, with 4 primary weapons available (Unlimited ammo base machine gun, flamer, rocket launcher, grenade launcher). Ammunition is very limited for the flamer and rocket launcher (the weapons I've also found have the least utility unless opening a wall etc.) The nade launcher was useful for blowing open some floors and vs. a particular boss but otherwise I've found the best utility from the starter machine gun. Some additional development to make the lesser used weapons more viable is hopefully on the horizon.\n\nLevels are generally well designed and fun--if you enjoy the side scrolling format. The "hide in the shadows" element can be useful and the bull charge is fun.\n\nBoss mechanics are generally well done, with identifiable patterns if one is paying attention.\n\nOverall, this is an enjoyable "time-waster" with a limited backstory and a fair bit of humour with references to other games and shows/movies.","May 22","true","15.3"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Nice game play, good level balance; (It is not an easy game, just at the right point, FUN)\n2.) Very nice developer\n- Efficient, polite, patient replies for help & support\n- Passion shown through seeking space for improvement\n\nFor now, I don't know about other players, but if for those who use 15" MacBook,\nremember to set it at 1280 x 800, and change the filter to something other than old TV mode to prevent offset cursor.\n\nAs mentioned by developer, the control config will be better.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOld Review:\n\nThe gameplay is good.\n\nHowever, the control setting is confusing.\nIt requires player to import or config a controller setting before launching a game.\nAnd before players click play, there is another controller config page.\nIn game, there is another controll setting page. Which one should I use?\n\nThe gameplay requires players to aim with the cursor which you can move it with mouse or gamepad.\nYet, the character is not really shooting at the cursor's direction.\nAnd it is hard to control it with gamepad since I don't know why the cursor will stick at the position where the mouse or touchpad was.\n\nHonestly, I really like the gameplay itself, please fix these so I can give it a yes for recommendation.","May 4","true","8.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","1"
