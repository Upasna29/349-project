With a solid developer and enough unlocks to keep you busy for hours on end, Tomb of Tyrants is worth every penny of its regular asking price.\n\n======================================\nPros:+ Developer: Updates regularly, appreciates feedback, communicates very well.\n+ Download: Very small and easy download, but not light on content.\n+ Graphics: Great pixel art style, with lively animation. Good color palette, too.\n+ Tiles: You can RGB their colors. Color customization is a personal joy of mine.\n+ UI: Easy to navigate, convenience features abound, blends into gameworld.\n+ UI(v2): The regular vs. strikethrough text is clever and genuinely cool.\n+ Audio: The bone crunching sound alone is possibly the best thing ever.\n+ Depth: Your tomb gets deeper and deeper. So do the mechanics of this game.\n+ Choice: There are a multitude of floors and goals to prioritize.\n\nCons:- Resolution: Minor gripe, initializes at a set resolution.\n- Patrols: Makes it hard to learn what monsters work well together.\n- "Oh...": There needs to be a more obvious death indicator.\n- "Wait!": Your hoard can fill so fast that you can't watch the floors.\n- Sound: There's a couple of minor issues like an infinite sound loop when paused at the right(wrong) time or some sounds playing incessantly at later stages.\n- Pause: This could already be the case, but I'd like it if there was a dedicated pause button, vs esc/main menu, since I tend to alt-tab frequently. Game already pulls up main menu if you click outside the window. This way I could keep my multiplier without the advantage of pausing.\n\n\nNeutral:± Tomb: Or crypt. Cryptic. Avoid if you like having all the information.\n± Time: "Just one more run!"...x10. It's pretty addicting.\n\n======================================\nIntroduction:Hello and welcome to my review of Tomb of Tyrants! This nifty match-4 game will have you lining up resources in your hoard to add dangerous floors to your toom, so you can continue being a Tyrant for longer. Good luck!\n\nGameplay:When you first start ToT, you're going to be simaltaneously playing the game and a tutorial while you start. This is pretty neat, but I found having such a small continue button to be a bit annoying when combined with unexpected tutorial boxes. Still, it's very pleasant having features organically explained as you discover them! As stated in the introduction, you match up 4 or more of a specific resource type so you can accumulate the right type and quantity of materials required to build floors. These floors will give you monsters, resources, and traps to help deal with the pesky heroes trying to meddle with your evil affairs. These floors are also built on top of your hoard, so you have to clear room at the top to be able to construct them, thankfully you can queue construction.\n\nBuilding floors or certain combinations of floors can give you access to other floors, which you unlock by completing prophecies. Prophecies are goals you have to complete while they are active, such as recruit 10 skeletons and accumulate 50 bone, but progress on them is persistent. Plots can also reward you with items and banners and such. There are also similar goals, that are time sensitive, called plots. Plots will award you with the fortification of a floor if you complete them in time, which allows it to stick around for another playthrough. Completing prophecies and plots feels really gratifying, and the sound effect for completing plots is especially pleasing. It's even better when you are completing them without knowing it, like hitting the jackpot on a slot machine after turning your head to talk to a buddy. There are also rituals: specific block shapes you can match to increase the maximum cap of the matched resource. Your monsters can even stick around for another run, too, if they beat a champion hero, becoming a champion themselves.\n\nSo, generally your gameplay is going to consist of picking a floor to build, clearing space while acquiring resources, and then continuing to clear space for more floors and to complete objectives. At times you may have to manually drop some monsters onto different floors, or use an item, but aside from planning in advance, the active part of the game will be had with matching. As of the latest update, this has been made more dynamic and challenging by dirt and arrowhead blocks. Dirt is destroyed by falling, and arrowheads by making a match next to them, where they will act like a wildcard.\n\n"But just how fun is it, and how is it as a matching game?" you may ask.\n\nIt's very fun, and a great spin on matching game with good execution.\n\nGraphics:The pixel art is well done, and the animations are lively. It is definitely worth mentioning that said pixel art scales very well with resolution. There are multiple options that can be used to change the look of the art, though, from dithering options to an aesthetic change such as hard or soft pixel scaling. There is a good choice of colors, and many different graphics for floors and monsters. A lot of your time will be spent with your hoard, so it is very good news that you may customize the colors of the resources that appear there. It will even change the colors of the resources everywhere else they appear in the game, too. All in all, if you like pixel art games, you'll like ToT.\n\nAudio:The music and sounds present in ToT are actually surprisingly well done. From the sounds of monsters and heroes dying, to various satisfying sounds played when you make different quantities of matches. You may not notice the music too much over all the other sounds that will happen as your tomb gets deeper, which may be a good thing, as the game could use another track or two, depending on who you ask. What is there, is satisfying and fun, though!\n\nConclusion:Tomb of Tyrants is a great game, and an amazing match-4 game. It seems to be criminally underappreciated. At $8.00, you can very easily get enough time in that haven't even paid a dollar an hour. I recommend Tomb of Tyrants at:\n\nFull price.\n\n======================================This endorsement approved by The Reviewers' Union,\nproviding better standards for reviews and reviewers.\n======================================","February 8","true","12.1"," 30 of 30 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","30","30","3","1"

Let me introduce you to Tomb of Tyrants. This gem of an indie game puts you in control of your own lair. Your goal is simple, survive the horde of angry heroes that want nothing more then to cut you up into pieces. To survive you must gather resources and build a huge underground fortress made up of monsters, traps and hot fresh death. What surprised me is that Tomb of Tyrants isn't necessarily about frantic fast paced matching, quite the contrary. Trying to combine key resources to get higher multipliers is key to certain quests. Planning out your moves delicately is rewarded. As you play Tomb of Tyrants you realize the game is far more complicated then it seems and it rewards you as you get deeper into its mechanics and features. Completing more quests grants you more rooms, items, resistances, champions, banners and more. Suddenly this game begins to resemble more of a strategy/RPG/TD game with a match 4 mini-game. This caught me off guard but I enjoyed it quite a bit. With adorable pixel graphics, easy to use UI and plenty of replay value, you should be checking out Tomb of Tyrants because its a blast!\n\nI made a video review to show off some of the features and gameplay of this game!\nhttps://youtu.be/K_1iCG8B5oA\nI hope you enjoy!\nMartyr","August 3, 2015","true","2.3"," 28 of 31 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","28","31","0","0"

As this character you gather / produce resources and build / expand an underground dungeon as a classical dungeon master.\n\nAt first glance it looks a lot like those decades old pattern matching games like bejeweled in a fantasy setting, but with a twist. The blocks you gather are in fact resources, which you can use to construct the next layer in your dungeon, buy single use items or recruit new units, which you have to unlock with another layer of the dungeon.\n\nConstructing one room of a certain dungeon room disables you to construct a different one from the same tier. As such, you really need to think about what kind of rooms you want and make effective combinations to defend your dungeon succesfully, as hero's will come in not only to loot your resources, but take your life / unlife as well.\n\nSo if you choose to focus on the undead (skeletons, zombies and necromancers) you'll have a tough time also maintaining an army of goblins, beasts, mercenaries or ritualistic dark elves with all the pro's and cons that come with each path. You can, but it won't be easy.\n\nThe graphics look very simplistic, but they complement the game itself remarkably, showing that graphics do not need high end rendering for game to be this great. The sound could use an upgrade, but isn't terrible. Online scoring system (if you're into that sort of thing) and very good integration with Steam.\n\nAll in all, highly addictive, very interesting and a challenge to form that specific combination of monsters that make your score go WOW!!!","March 21, 2015","true","47.7"," 18 of 20 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","18","20","0","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/woodbin/recommended/340360/","woodbin","[kabrňák] Woodbin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/woodbin/","1072 products in account","I seriously don't know how to start this review. There's so much to say about this game. I think I should start by shouting huge cheerish THANK YOU! To Jake Huhman, the game's sole developer and publisher. Not only because he made an amazing game, but because he's a great friendly guy, really caring about his game and it's players. The amount of work he put into his game is astounding, fixing bugs, releasing frequent updates and inserting loads of references and little details and jokes anywhere where's some text. Look at Floor names.  He hangs out around the forums a lot, and likes to chat about ideas. So once again, kudos to you!\n\nNow finally to the game. Let's put a quick TL:DR  intro here: At the first look the game looks like a simple tile matcher puzzle game, and it truly is one, but I guarantee it's the best one ever made. It builds upon the simple concept and expands it to a strategy genre. For matching tiles, you get resources. For resources, you recruit units or build floors. To build floors, you have to make room in your Hoard, the stockpile where Loot falls from dead enemy Heroes, defeated by your minions, and after building a floor. Loot which you match to get MOAR RESOURCES. All this in quick cartoonish package filled to the brim with humour.\n\nDon't get deceived by it's cartoonish pixelart look, though the game graphics are very creative, detail and expertly  crafted to finest pixelart, all staying in the cartoonish theme of the game. Nice element is you can customize colors of resources.\n\nIn the core, this game has a very complex systems built in which offer tens of hours of just explorating what Units can you build, going through Phropecies to "building" your own game style, possibly retaining it through multiple playthroughs using the Legacy system. This system allows you to keep hero minions, items, floors and resource capacity in exchange for completing time limited quests, which range a lot in variety and difficulty. You progress through the game not only on the level of a single "run", but also on scope of multiple ones, as you unlock new Floors through Phropecies, which for example require you to build several floors (sometimes ones which block each other), and recruit some amount of units. Each floor you unlock falls under a specific Tier, which form trees of possible combinations of units you can use to defend your dungeon. And as they are trees, to climb some branches you have to give up some units, because some floors block each other, as I mentioned before. Some floors work as traps, other allow you to recruit Mounts, which can your Biped minions use to roam the dungeon, offering considerable  advantage.\n\nExpecting your question "and what are they for?" I will explain. Your minions are defending you, because you are an extremely evil person and all righteous persons want to hang your head above their fireplaces. And they group at the dungeons ground floor, waiting for it to open, forming waves of trouble waiting at you periodically. All units travel around the vertical dungeon using elevators, and as heroes descend by one floor at a time, your minions can travel freely, patroling the dungeon in meantime.\n\nGranted is, Heroes will sooner or later be caught by your minions, and when this happens, the combat happens. It is turn based and works on cycling heroes in party, each taking one attack and defense at a time. Both minions and heroes have great variance of attacks, abilities and perks, some working as buffers or poisoning enemies.  Those perks don't serve only for combat. If you have a general "theme" in your floors and units, specific heroes come to defeat you, for example necromantinc dungeon resulting in holy heroes.\n\nExpanding the system even more, sometimes you can find items in your hoard which upon collecting serve either as passive effects to the game, active items affecting Hoard with for example spreading a specific resource or shuffling the hoard, or even serve as Potions on a specific floor, taking some time to recharge after each use. Another hoard element is that you can build specific tetromino-and larger- shapes to raise capacity of a specific resource stockpile. And if you need some more to fiddle with the game. there's possibility to move floors, even with enemy heroes in them, for a little price. Needing specific resource and your hoard is almost empty? You can refill it for a price of a little chunk of each of your resources. Want another? You can unlock Banners, which give you specific bonuses to your game, for example granting more mouse slides per move.  And if you still arent satisfied, don't worry, Jake improves the game at a regular pace.\n\nMy apologies for how long this review became. I kinda got carried away, as this game revived my belief in the inovation in genre of quick puzzle games, granting me tens of hours of intelligent, though-out and great fun, which I believe won't certainly end soon. To end the review, let's look at overal Pros and Cons:\n\nPros:\nSimple concept, deeply and well-thoughtly expanded, with ongoing development.\nVery nice and detail pixelart graphics\nOffers a lot to explore and needs a lot of time to explore everything. And it's worth it.\nNice music\nDeep strategy system allowing for your own game style, with large variety of units and items to use as ingredients\nThe game feels very alive, with units battling at multiple floors and roaming the dungeon. Seeing heroes run into sawblade traps is very satisfying.\nPuns everywhere\nFound out Fungus traps are OP (already balanced out), built enough floors to have over two dozens of Fungus traps, heroes died even without being touched by minions. Played the run for three hours. Got a 1st place global highscore and had it for a few days. 11/10 would try to gain highscore again.   Cons:\nTerrible, addictive timesinker\nSometimes, the mouse control feels a little bit...ambivalent, but after adding the possibility to cancel your move on hoard with right click, these issues are not as anoying as before\nSeriously, I don't know, this game is great and getting better with each update.\nThank you for reading, I hope I helped you deciding whether buy this game, treating yourself with an amazing logic game, and rewarding Jake for his work, as he truly deserves it.","November 10, 2015","true","54.5"," 18 of 20 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","18","20","0","0"

It is in the medium/ high price range for Match games on Steam, but its unique gameplay and replayability (in addition to its leaderboards, cards, achievements, and active support) makes it worth its price.\n\nIt's a Match 4 game where you can drag blocks both horizontally and vertically in the same motion. There are persistent optional challenges in the form of matching to create certain shapes or undertaking particular actions which generate rewards.\n\nIn addition to matching blocks (which are actually resources), you'll be devoting some of your time toward stopping the heroes who would march through your tomb and kill your tyrant. That's right, technically you're the bad guy—but don't worry, being bad leads to good fun. Besides, you're just hanging out in your dungeon, minding your own business, when a bunch of heroes drop in and start making trouble in your neighborhood. If you ask me, THEY’RE the ones up to no good.\n\nThe more you play the game the more you'll appreciate its layers (please pardon the pun). You'll develop strategies unique to your playstyle and will probably do better each time you play. Although you can't save your game, you automatically carry over a lot of unlocks from game to game, in addition to certain things you can earn the ability to save.\n\nRight now the game is still being tweaked a bit and is at about an 'A' in my mind. I suspect that in a few more patches it will rank as an "A+". The developer is very active in Steam discussions and even friended me to help me when I posted about an issue I had, so I have complete faith in the final product being even more fantastic that it already is now.\n\nTl;dr: It’s one of the best matching games on Steam* and it’s worth its price tag.\n\n*if you look at my games played you’ll see I’ve tried most of them","June 30, 2015","true","23.5"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","14","14","0","0"

(C'mon, you KNOW you want to!) Want to smite pesky do-gooders who invade YOUR realm? Want to relive the glory of being the Horned Reaper or that oppressive Overlord with his Merry Minions? Then this game is for YOU!!\n\nJoin Jake Huhman on his diabolical adventures in hoard-pillaging, tomb-building, and !!Hero-Mashing!! Unlock an ever-expanding range of murderous minions, blasphemous buildings, alluring loot, and archaic artefacts! Be the best Tyrant that ever lived...well, until you die! But EVIL is never truly defeated! Empower a new Tyrant to even loftier heights (of score) and foul play - if you dare!\n\nOn a more serious note, it really is a wonderful game, with a highly dedicated developer. New content is rolled out on a weekly, if not daily, basis. If you have questions in the forums, he WILL take the time to talk to you and help you out. He has incorporated many good suggestions from many people, and the game has become that much better for it.\n\nYou are cast as the anonymous Tyrant (presumed Lich) who sets up shop under a remote mausoleum (the Tomb). You begin with only your Sanctum, with an endless well of resources from previous Tyrants yawning down below your feet. You slide rows horizontally in this hoard and match regions of four of the same type. There are many - Ruins, Treasure, Equipment, Mechanisms, Flesh, Bones, Arcane, etc. Each match you make earns you a given amount of that resource. Making matches in specific, predefined shapes will increase the maximum storage of the resource you matched. This allows you to focus on the resources you'll need, if you are careful.\n\nThe game does have build paths. Many floors (aka rooms) are mutually exclusive. You cannot build a Portentous Portal (Imps) and a Wicked Workshop (Gremlins, and produces Mechanisms and Equipment that drops into the hoard below) in the same Tomb. The monsters each floor gives have their own unique abilities, traits, and uses. Some are used as Hunters who will pursue enemies wherever they go. Others merely follow a patrol route, fighting what they encounter on the route (which is down to the Sanctum, then back up again, repeated). So having that Lupine Lair (wolves) or Gossamer Gallows (giant spiders) gives you very useful hunters. You will need them.\n\nFrom your first slide of the Hoard puzzle, a timer begins counting down for a wave of Heroes. They will emerge one by one from the mists of the forest and camp on the surface until the timers reaches zero, at which point they invade the Tomb en masse, intent on getting to the Sanctum (and YOU) and putting an end to your Evil Reign. Kill them quickly as the next wave comes sooner than you'd like in each case. Each floor that hosts a battle will have a maximum of four monsters and four heroes slugging it out in initiative order. If more heroes or monsters enter the floor, they bypass the fight by moving through the background and continuing on until they themselves get into combat.\n\nAs you fulfill certain objectives, known as Prophecies, you unlock further floors and artifacts for use. Artifacts are earned by matching them up in the Hoard when they appear. They give an ongoing benefit as long as you have them in your item bar (inventory of a sort). For example, once you unlock King-sized Kibble and match it up, all of your monsters that have the trait "Beast" will gain a permanant +2 HP from that point on. I refer you back to the part about Giant Spiders and Wolves. They have the Beast trait.\n\nOne of the great things about this game is that entirely new floors are being added all the time. Traps you can place on floors just got implemented. There are already floors (the Harrowing Hallway) that are nothing BUT a gauntlet of traps to slice and skewer those weak heroes who pass through them. Along with the new floors come new creatures, with new possibilities. Bear in mind, they game is still early accesss, so imagine, if you will, how much new content Jake can pile into this game before he considers it to be version 1.0. Even then, I'm sure he won't stop adding even MORE goodness to the game. Bosses, checkpoints, tricks, more traps, legacy traits and items that carry on from one Tyrant to the next. Oh, the possibilities!\n\nYou know what, readers? Buy the game. You'll have plenty of fun with it, and for the price of $8.00, its a bargain. Think, thats about 3 Quesoritos at Taco Bell. Not so pricey, eh? As for myself, I'm done talking about it, now i'm going to go play it...","March 2, 2015","true","45.7"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","93","13","14","2","0"

You should definitely give it a go!\n\nIts genre is a combination of match-4 and tower defense, with RPG rogue-like elements (unlocks and progressive upgrades of items and levels) and quite a bit of strategy involved.\n\nThe developer is very active, releasing frequent updates, and interacting with the players.\n\nThe learning curve can feel a little steep on first approach, but once you understand what you are doing you will find yourself playing this game again and again, and enjoying the hell out of it.\n\n*************************\nGameplay Basics\nI am including the basics here because I believe that some players get confused by some of the mechanics on first approach. This game is far deeper and more complex than it seems at first glance, though it allows for fairly casual gameplay.\n\nYour main goal is to defend your Tyrant, who dwells in the bottom floor of your dungeon. You do so by building floors, which are populated by different creatures that will fight off the heroes trying to reach and kill your Tyrant.\n\nTo build the floors you need resources, which you gather by matching tiles (4 or more). If you create a match in one of the special shapes listed around the tile pool (rituals), your capacity for that specific resource will increase. The last update has added some special tiles (dirt and wildcards) which require special conditions to be eliminated, increasing the challenge. To be able to build the floors you also need a number of empty rows in your resource pool. You can queue floors to be built as soon as you have enough resources and space.\n\nOccasionally, special items will appear in the resource pool. When you match them, they will transfer to your item pool. Some of these items provide passive bonuses, some others can be activated to various effects (e.g. healing your minions, or gathering a particular resource). If the item is already in your pool, it will level up.\n\nSpecial tasks can be fulfilled to unlock new items, minions and floors (prophecies) or to upgrade existing floors (plots). These appear at the top of the screen, and can take many forms: from doing a certain number of matches, to not spending a particular resource for a set period of time, to killing a number of heroes, levelling up some of your minions...\nPlots generally have a time limit, and are easier to fulfil than prophecies.\n\nFloors are progressively unlocked. There is a first set of paired, mutually exclusive floors (building one prevents you from building the other), which adds great replayability value (you can play with different combinations in subsequent playthroughs), but the higher level floors are unlocked independently, through prophecies.\n\nSpecial minions can be dropped at any dungeon floor (e.g. to protect your Tyrant), and after they reach a certain level they are also carried over to subsequent playthroughs.\n\nAt any point, you can right click on things to bring up the codex, which explains in detail what that floor/item/minion does (this is something I strongly encourage you to do!). There is also a brief tutorial, that explains action on the fly the first time you carry them out.\n\n*************************\nPros\nDeveloper - in a time when bad, unfinished products and perpetual early-access games are becoming the norm, it's so refreshing to find a developer who really cares about his game and its players! He regularly responds to comments, listens to feedback and releases regular, stable updates (the latest large update was released after a long opt-in beta period in which players provided direct feedback, resulting in several major improvements).\n\nReplayability - individual games last from several minutes to 1-2 hours (once you get good at surviving!), allowing for fairly casual gameplay, but you will find yourself coming back to this game again and again, and it always feels like it has something new to offer, as there is a vast amount of content to unlock, and you can try several strategies. I have played the game for ~18 hours at this point, and I feel like only now I'm beginning to scratch the surface.\n\nArt style - beautiful, colourful pixel art that is also intuitive.\n\nCustomization - you can change the colour palette, pixel style, UI border size... and don't forget to check out the banners, which are unlockable, and provide different bonuses.\n\nMulti-platform - you can play on Windows, Linux and MacOS, and it even has controller support! It is also a very small download.\n\nCons\nLearning curve - it can feel a little steep at the beginning. You might be deceived by the simple looks, skip the tutorial and then get overwhemed when you get a glimpse of the underlying complexity. If this happens don't give up: re-activate the tutorial, and look things up in the codex. You won't regret giving the game a second chance.\n\nResolution - the resolution options are currently a bit limited, but I believe that this will be tackled, eventually.\n\nRed alert - when the heroes reach the levels above your Tyrant, an alarm starts playing (you can turn it off completely, but I don't recommend it) so you can take actions to help the Tyrant survive the assault. In the late game, when the Tyrant is constantly under threat, I find the constant blaring a little annoying. This is personal preference, though.\n*************************\nConclusions\nThis is a veritable gem of a game, especially for the price. I am very surprised that it is not a best-seller. If you like any of the genres it covers, you should definitely give it a try!\n\n10/10","May 29","true","21.1"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","5"

There are a lot of unlockable elements in the game and items to shake up gameplay a bit.  Unfortunately, some elements are much harder to unlock than others, and so while I had a large selection of floor types open, I had a total of five items I could find, out of a theoretical 80 or something.\n\nThe pixel graphics are cute if you're into that kind of thing (I totally am) and the music is...repetitive but stayed in the background enough I could tolerate it.\n\nThe "rituals" (puzzles you could do to increase resource limits) are a clever element, and figuring out how to make them was an interesting challenge.\n\nThe tile spawning works strangely--I think it has something to do with the hero waves but there would be long periods where few to no new blocks would drop.  It was especially aggravating when you would have a timed gathering challenge and no resources (or the particular resource you needed) would spawn, leaving you shuffling around a few scraps and watching your monsters die.\n\nOverall it's worth a sale purchase as a fun casual game.  It pauses whenever you close it so you can build for a while and then when the microwave beeps it's easy to set aside.","April 15","true","5.4"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

There is a lot of fun to be had with this engaging match-4 game, and I like the use of theme combined with the mechanics of how you collect and use resources.\n\nI love the legacy aspect of the game, playing multiple times to unlock new floors and completing goals to retain resources for your next play-through.  It pulls inspiration from a lot of sources without being a knock-off clone, but remains familiar enough that you can pick it up quickly.  This is a casual game you can play to unwind, but one which keeps finding new ways to surprise you if you play long term.\n\nIs it perfect?  No.  Pixel based graphics might be offputting to some, and I actually would like to see a slightly higher resolution be implemented for the game (nothing major, I'm not expecting rendered 3D or anything... just closer to Super Nintendo graphics than NES).  I also think that there needs to be some refinement for when the game gets played on larger monitors.

(Sidenote: This game is a great example of what Early Access really should be- to refine and make better games, not a cheap cash grab- kudos mr developer~)\n\nHow do you describe this game?\n\nThis game has so much complexity into it:\n­- The meat of it, is basically a match 4 game where you can only slide rows left and right.\n- The 2nd part of it is a "tower defense" style where you have to build rooms to slow the enemy\n- The 3rd part is the management part of it, you need to manage resource, use items, and manage your space for more rooms\n\nIt's complex, casual, and addictive-\nWhen you lose, and you will lose, the game goes so seamlessly to start the puzzler over, this may sound so trivial but it made me spend time playing it.\n\nIssues that I hope got addressed in future versions: (and I got faith because I owned this for 2 days so far? and there're already 2 patches to fix bugs)\n- The main one, I feel like this game need better tutorial/manual- I was so confused (and even still on the details of what room does what, the 'tech tree', etc)\n- The interface- it looks intimidating, so much information on screen (again I reckon some of them need better explanation: what are the resources for, what produces what, etc), also sometimes important things on screen got covered by other window (yes there are different placements of the interface but I dont think they're ideal at the moment) It feels weird criticising the interface as some parts are very intuitive\n- Sometimes it can be difficult to tell which ones are the enemy, and which ones are your allies\n- Minor complaint- music, only 1 looping track?\n\nAll in all, once you get to the flow of this game, you'd be surprised at how indepth the experience is, it has its minor issues, but my god, what a fun little gem. I haven't enjoyed a casual matching puzzle this much for awhile considering how saturated the market it is of it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GameDragonZero/recommended/340360/","GameDragonZero","GameDragonZero","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GameDragonZero/","77 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nReview For 2015.1.26 Updated 2/6/2015\n\nShorter: A clever and deep mix of tower building/defense, puzzling, and strategy with a sense of humor that can be very addictive.   Well-supported and being constantly improved by the creator, the game is a must-buy for puzzle/strategy hybrid enthusiasts.\n\nTomb of Tyrants' idea is simple - you're a tyrant in the Tomb of Tyrants, using your hoard of good to build a deeper and deeper dungeon to keep pesky adventurers away.  As you build more floors to the tomb, you get more monsters and options to deal with the various do gooders.  As you build, use resource floors, and defeat adventuers, you add to your hoard.  Oh, sure the adventurers will defeat you eventually, so how long can you hold out?\n\nTomb of Tyrant's tower defense element is also simple - add floors with traps, resources, and monster spawns, buy minions, and use equipment to defeat a continuing stream of fantasy tropes.  Where it does one different is the hoard mechanic.  That big pile of gold, equipment, ruins, bones, flesh, and so on is a giant match-four puzzle - you have to match up the things in your hoard to acquire resources.\n\nSo, in short, as you build the tower, you're also playing a matching-tile puzzle game.\n\nThis puzzle element adds a certain something to the game.  This could be just agame of tower planning, minion summoning, and hero-mashing.  The puzzle element means that you break out of standard mechanics and resource management, and have to apply several set of skills at once. It also avoids (but doesn't remove) the inevitable wait-for-the-attack games like this can have - usually as heroes gather you're busy taking advantage of what the last group of heroes dropped.\n\nThe game also has a sense of humor, with amusing names, jokey flavor text, and a pixel-graphic aesthetic.  It's charmingly light-hearted and has it's own personality.  There's something delightfully fun about the whole affair that feels good-natured . . . well good-natured for a game of killing adventurers.\n\nThe game requires a lot of strategy.  You have to decide which floors to build  (some of which may exclude or be required for other floors).  You have to choose what minions to summon - your choices in floors determine what minons are available.  You have to choose what items to use - and if you want to buy or sell them depending on the dungeon you've built.\n\nAdding to all of this are the unlockables.  You complete "prophecies" (reaching certain achievements) to unlock even more floors and thus more options in the game.  These unlocked items become a permanent part of your inventory, so the next Tyrant can take advantage of them.\n\nThe game has a few flaws:\n* The music is lackluster.\n* The help guide isn't that  helpful, but is being improved.  There needs to be more information on the game creatures, rules, and features.\n* There are some controller issues, but I understand that's not high priority right now.\n\nIt's hard to criticize the game as it's quite clever and well-done even in early access, and fun enough to be compelling (first day I got it I played it for 3 hours).  Most additions to the game are a mix of UI improvements and even more content around an already solid game.\n\nThe author (apparently it's written by one person) adds new content as it develops and is enthused about feedback - in fact he even responded to this review, which shows a fantastic level of ownership.  The author also posts reguarly in the forums and even shows screenshots of new ideas.\n\nThe game is already highly entertaining and well done - and is still getting better all the time.\n\nNow excuse me, the adventurers are knocking at my door, and the Blasphemous Basiilica isn't going to desecrate itself . . .","January 23, 2015","true","13.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/noblekale/recommended/340360/","noblekale","noblekale","http://steamcommunity.com/id/noblekale/","364 products in account","This is a yes, but with a few caveats:\n\nThe game is fun, and has a good combination of mechanics. It's got a good, consistent look/feel to it, and the music is reasonable. The interface is rather good too - not too much guesswork (apart from stuff below). Overall, it feels pretty polished.\n\nNow to get to the caveats (in this case, the bad stuff):\n\nThe game kinda falls apart after a few hours (of total play). There just hits a point where you don't know whether you're progressing or not, and there's a metagame mechanic (the legacy system) that isn't very well explained and kind of breaks stuff more than anything else. You can even designate the standard 'Tyrant hangs out here' room you get every game as a legacy room, which means you just wasted a legacy slot. Bit of an oversight.\n\nThe other thing that basically falls over, is the ritual system. While it's nice to see the concept of a 'match four' system where orientation and position are important, sadly this one requires you to match shapes that are far too complex to be reasonable.\n\nThere's a codex which is meant to explain things, but a chart would've been better (also, it only shows you what you already get from the alt-text which renders it obsolete and useless).\n\nThe game gives you a lot of choices, but ultimately since you don't really tend to look at your dungeon (ever), these are pretty meaningless (really, what's the difference in the rooms? What impact will they have? It's not very apparent). The dungeon/base building aspect of the game doesn't give you any form of progress assessment, so you never know how well you're doing.\n\nThe final part where the game falls apart, is the combo system. Sure, no problem - match more than four tiles or get more than a single match with a move, get a bonus. No worries - except in this one due to the often lack of resources, you just can't get more than four tiles together regularly. Forget about trying to set up multiple matches. I felt like the size of the horde was a crippling restraint.\n\nSo, what we have is: a fun game that you can play every now and then, but with a broken metagame, combo system and progression. Fun for a few hours, which honestly is fine for a few bucks.","December 29, 2015","true","3.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I thought the core of the game was solid. Match 4 to get loot to spend on upgrades like rooms or for more minions. That part is very solid. I like the idea of the game. That being said its a mixed bag in my eyes. I would love to see some sort of story or progression other then try to stay alive as long as you can. Some stuff does carry over to the next game after you die\n\nI do think the game is overly complicated to the point where its super hard to know what to do. I think the game has so many ideas and doesnt focus more on the ones that work. The patrol function when you have a champion you can send him upstairs to collect stuff. I found this to be counter intuitive. Why would you want your champion to go mucking about for fruits when he could be killing heroes. Also moving the character around felt akward and strange. Grab character and move him up to the surface. I would think it be easier to click on character and tell him move to the top.  My other slight nit pick is that the bad guys and the good guys look the same. I would love to see my minions highlighted or a different color so I could pick them out.\n\nI would like to see the game tighten up a bit more. I might update this review after having played it some more. So to many ideas in this game need to focus more on the core of the game. I think if I had to rate this out of 10 I would rate it a 6.5 out of 10.

This game scratches that itch very effectively in a combination of base defense and puzzle gaming.\n\nAnd it also shows you why evil overlords tend to go mad, since unless you can blaze through the puzzle part, a lot of the challenge is the fact that it's hard work to stay on top of it all. You have to clear the puzzles to get resources, but then you have to spend those resources just as fast to expand your base and rehire minions as they inevitably die to the blades of the heroes who intrude upon your lair. As heroes die, resources rain down to refill the puzzle grid... blocking downward expansion until you clear them, but rebuilding your puzzle resources. You get potions to buff or heal your minions, but while you're using them, you're not solving the puzzles, which means you're not getting resources to resummon dead minions... and if you don't solve the puzzles fast enough you don't get the space to build expansions, but while you're solving the puzzles heroes keep attacking and the grid is full again and aaaaagh how did heroes get down to the sanctum level?! Guards! Guards!\n\nHaving to continually switch contexts keeps the game from feeling stale during a playthrough, and it's easy to pick up, though some of the mechanics like potions are more challenging. The 'match colored blocks' style puzzles should be familiar to basically everyone by now, and if you can do that, you can figure out everything else through play.\n\nGreat potential in this game, even in "early access".","March 17, 2015","true","3.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/recommended/340360/","Steamified","Warwick J.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/","3916 products in account","I am quickly finding that there are quite a lot of games that we’re covering in our Indie Spotlight and Early Access Insights that I want to continue playing long after I’ve written a Steamified in a Nutshell for it. Unfortunately, with the pace of the website and with a lot of plans in the works in the not too distant future that often becomes an impossibility. Prior to our second launch I figured that starting Steamified would enable me to spend more time playing games but it just hasn’t turned out that way yet. I’m hoping to remedy the situation by hiring some aspiring writers who can provide quality articles on the site to further your entertainment and knowledge.\n\nOne of the games that I really want to spend a significant amount of time playing is Tomb of Tyrants by Jake Huhman. Once you dig into the tomb you will quickly discover that it’s much deeper than your standard – and casual – match 4 type game. Yes, the base mechanics in the game would make you believe that it is in part your base match four game but once you delve deeper you quickly discover the amount of strategy and skill required to be successful with the game.\n\nThe aim of the game is to overcome the AI’s heroes that are attacking you. You can do this by building an underground fortress that is constituted of traps and minions/monsters among other things. You gain these through the match four gameplay mechanic. However, rather than it being a typical match four game where quickness is rewarded deep strategy is rewarded with gaining higher multipliers. This makes the game not necessarily slower but definitely more methodical. Intelligent game play is consistently rewarded above the taking of obvious but not necessarily more efficient matches. This process moves the game away from being a match four and into a tower defense, strategy, RPG puzzle game. It’s a very impressive mixture that is done incredibly well.\n\nThe only thing that I would disagree with developer and self-publisher Jake Huhman on is that I would argue against it being considered a casual game. Yes, if you so choose the game can be played in a casual manner but I would argue that players will never see anything near the best that his game has to offer by playing in such a manner. This is why I would love to – and will – be spending significantly more time with Tombs of Tyrants. It’s a fantastic game that can be deeply rewarding.\n\nFor more reviews similar to this one and our daily giveaways please visit http://www.steamified.com/","January 14","true","4.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Oddly, I just happen to like puzzle games, I'm not good at them, maybe that's why I am drawn to them. However, that is besides the point. Tomb of the Tyrants takes the best aspects of games like Bejewled and innovates them into something new and exciting and rogue-like too. I'm also one of the few I know who realy likes indie/casual games, almost none of my steam "friends" (more like associates really, most of them) don't like casual games except for maybe one or two of them. However, Tomb of the Tyrants appears to be more than that too. It's a game with cyclic theme of having one tyrant after the other fell to their inevitable ends in strife to rule their tomb. If you are a book reader, this game REALLY reminds me of a very good and funny book, Mogworld. Mogworld was an amazing book that was about NPCs in a video game, but didn't know it. Jim, one of the main characters was an undead mage employed by Lord dreadgrave who is deleted... for being a too powerful NPC. The story is really about Jim but I like to think of the Tyrants of the Tombs as Lord Deadgrave, and one of his subjects sometimes as Jim and the other cast of characters.\n\ntl;dr In my opinion, amazing game with a lot of love. Ironically, it was developed to be binged played for around an hour, you can easily exceed that time depending on playstyle. But don't let that detail fool you, the game features little unlock features through every playthough so one play isn't the same as the next. I would imagine the indie title Kingdom got the idea from this game, as they both style after a "twighlight zone" or endless cycle theme where one builds a kingdom only to watch it topple, over and over again.","March 13","true","3.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Doesn't this make it easy? Yes, it does! You can almost always engineer a match with a little time, and that's great, because:\n\nIt's ALSO an excellent dungeon management strategy game, running in pausable real-time.  Arrange your minions so that their various powers (differing with range) complement each other, put them at appropriate locations to defeat the ever-growing tide of heroes that assaults your dungeon, and keep building more and better dungeon rooms to support your tyranny.\n\nThe match-4 game provides resources but ALSO immediate effects (mostly healing) to your troops, so you want to ideally coordinate your matching at just the right time to keep them healthy as they fight, but there are also timed events to unlock or improve things that require certain things to be done under a time limit, and if a minion dies you can match bones to rez it for free if you're quick enough, and then bigger multiples matched at once increase the effect so you certainly want those for the xp boosting tiles...  That's why it's fine for the matching portion to be 'easy', because you've got all this other stuff on top to think about that prevents it becoming boring.  Indeed, having the matching be comparatively easy prevents it becoming immensely frustrating if you couldn't match what you needed.  As it is, it's a wonderful tradeoff between attention, time, and reward.\n\nThe dungeon strategy part starts simple but rapidly expands to have a lot more depth (pun not originally intended, but I'll stick with it) as you get rooms and traps and new minion types and upgrades and suchlike.\n\nAll in all, this is EXCELLENT for the price it's at, and one of the best in the puzzle/strategy genre!","June 6","true","5.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
