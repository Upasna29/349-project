There are other missions where you assassinate people, protect s bomb from being defused using silenced snipers.

In a multiplayer the players have 50 second in each turn, in other modes time is not limited. In a game you can found five different classes, all has different features. You also can use in every round one type of booster (from four available) and you can use three different grenades types. At the moment game has 7 maps, but this amount will be grow up in the future. Also you can change a weapons of your squad members.  You can buy weapons, on the store, what you can earn playing, survival mode, and multiplayer.\nControl is well solved, you can lean this enough fast with basic tactic elements in well complected tutorial.\n\nGame have a three modes: campaign, survival and multiplayer. In a campaign you should try complete the current missions , the missions are various, for example your main objective can be a kill a target, save hostage etc.\nIn a survival mode, your objective is to defuse a bomb in so many rounds how you can and hit bigger points. In every round the enemies number grooving and they improve their tactic. Also if you complete extra challenge you can earn more points.\nIn a multiplayer you play with another player, in this mode one player main objective is to plant the bomb, in this time the other player should try defuse it.\n\nThe graphic is  well designed and looks good. Sounds are good, and music to. Game also have a leaderboards and replay saving feature.\n\nSo my verdict\n\n+Deep tutorial\n+Leaderboards\n+Addictive gameplay\n+Cross-Platform multiplayer\n+Deep tactical system\n+However its a Early Access, it have enough content right now\n\n-At the moment is hard to find an opponent in multiplayer\n-Only one game mode in multiplayer\n-No steam achievements and trading cards\n\nI think this game is very promising, its in Early Access, but from the start have enough content what in future be even more. The gameplay is interesting, can keep you mind for longer time. The biggest minus in the moment maybe that, game is less know, so in a multiplayer is very hard to find a opponent, but the developers today released the demo where a multiplayer is available, so this probably resolve the problem with active online players.","January 27","true","10.0"," 28 of 46 people (61%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","61","28","46","4","3"

My only complaint is the matchmaking which tends to pitch me (a level 2 noob :3) against level 100 people. It's rather frsutrating as they have a lot more experiance in the game and have therefore learnt what tactics work good and really know how to utilise their guys properly. They also have much better gear an will shred me to pieces.\n\nThere's no point in saying "git gud" or "use better tactics" because the fact of the matter is: I only have a few hours on the game, and the people I usually fight have a few hundred hours. Kind of unfair don't you think?\n\nStill, this is a really fun game and tho the matchmaking can screw you over, I have had a few cases where I destroyed a high level player simply by playing better than them. I definately reccomend this to anyone who likes tuen based tactical games.","May 4","true","3.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Looking at it head on may not seem like the best thing to do but when you go into the gameplay more, you'll find every decision you make can and will change the outcome of each single player mission.\n\nThe tutorial paves a fantastic route for new players to get into the game.\n\nGame Engine wise, it will and CAN play on almost EVERY system (unless you're playing on a really crappy potato machine)\n\nThe game has many different mechanics from grenade deployment, boosters (this are free every round. No IAPs), movement, vision tracking and more. The mechanics may look simple but you will slowly and gradually get used to it and find out you can do a lot of more complicated plan adjustment.\n\nMultiplayer seems to be dead at least from my standpoint\n\nThe game itself does not look great and may disappoint some of you guys out there (I know I am a bit disappointed at the graphics).\n\nIt is priced at a cheap $10.50 but till now, I don't feel like I have my full money's worth just yet. This is probably due to me playing a lot of value based games instead of this. Yes, I paid the full price in case anyone was wondering.","June 6","true","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
