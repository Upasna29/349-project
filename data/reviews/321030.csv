It doesn't really look good with flat textures and with everything being grey and bland.  The story makes no sense at all how you are a drunk guy that based out in the street and now you have to fight demons in your head.\n\nThe main problem with this game is the difficulty. first level you wake up get a gun kill the first demon watch a cut scene and die.  yep unless you are in an area of cover before the next area activates you will die really quickly and the enemies are bullet sponges for days.  some of the attacks so up on the screen to know what will kill you but regular bullets have no visual indication so you never know when or where shots come from.  also there is no indication as to whether or not you have been hurt or y how much except for a bar made of several boxes which are grey and black.\n\nI only got to the second level where it wanted me to get music sheets to play the piano. This is the worst example of a cover shooter when all you can do is hope to not get hit and get through areas without dying and restarting the whole level.\n","September 14, 2014","false","0.3"," 137 of 152 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","137","152","2","3"

Ridiculously bad voice acting, with a story line that doesn't make sense. The worst is the gameplay, basically monsters spawn in horde, and their projectile will 1 hit kill you, while it will take you 10 hits with your crappy weapon to kill them (no headshot kill as far as I can see). And somehow there's no checkpoint so you if you die you have to restart the level again. In fact, some are forced, in level 2, you will open a door and immediately get hit in your face with a large projectile resulting in instant death. The weapons doesn't have any feel to them, there is no indicator of the amount of ammo left or anothing like that, just a bar with white/gray lines that make no sense at all.

(not like DARK SOUL'S does though as that game make's sense and reward's you for your effort's-this does not)\n3 - Do you really want a game on your account that just show's itself up as soon as you download and start it up to play?????\nWell if you can answer yes to the above then by all mean's go ahead and buy it,if that's not you (THANK GOD) then stear clear as this is one game that (in my humble opinion) isnt even worth getting in a bundle,with 90% off or (and i hate to say this) FREE.\n\n(I DO NOT OWN ANY OF THE CLIPS OF VIDEO'S PUT UP IN THIS REVIEW AND THEY BELONG TO THEIR RESPECTIVE OWNER'S AND ARE THEIR'S BY COPYRIGHT)","November 29, 2014","false","0.4"," 89 of 106 people (84%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","84","89","106","6","12"

I gave it a chance.\n\nIn the first level you get to pick up some weapons on the ground and then get ambushed by enemies. Some shoot projectiles that kill you instantly or knock you around if you're close to their blast. I learned this and worked around it. When you're in an open area like the first level they're fairly easy to dodge. There was a gun on the ground marked "bonus" which I'm guessing the developer added later? It has practically infinite ammo and a molotov/grenade launcher on the secondary fire, which you pretty much need. The normal guns do not have much ammo and ammo pickups are scarce. FUN FACT: If you watch the developer's playthrough videos on the Desura page for this game, you will see he uses this weapon and its infinite grenades to kill enemies by knowing where they will spawn and spamming them against walls while out of their sight.\n\nThen came the second level. I examined a letter on a desk and the game crashed. I restarted, picked up the letter, enemies spawned, killed them (after dying a few of times of course) moved onto the next room, picked up some health, crashed. After much dying I manage to get about 75% of the way through the level, where I walked into a small room and two insta-kill projectile enemies spawned. That's when I pretty much gave up trying to play the game normally.\n\nI pressed on, using my advanced technical prowess to discover that typing "god" in the console enables god mode. Levels 2 through 4 have you finding keys to get to keys to get to keys to finally open a door where you need to go, except when the keys are switches. All of the levels are really short (about 5 minutes each, discounting deaths), having you fight in close quarters with many of those insta-kill enemies before reaching a boss at the end. After 5 levels the game is over.\n\nBut then there's the bonus DLC level! This one was a lot of fun. In the DLC, the enemies can sometimes kill you even when you enable god mode with the console! Using a combination of god mode, noclip (ghost/walk), and trial and error I managed to get through this one. It's a long level which just repeats "fight a horde of enemies, find health kit and ammo" until you get to the end where there are two large rooms with a dozen enemies each inside. I don't see how it is even possible to pass this, but if you somehow manage then at the end there is a dead end which magically ends the level if you walk into the wall.\n\nI have a soft spot for mediocre shooters, but this is just borderline playable if it doesn't crash on you. If you use extremely cheap tactics with the infinite ammo gun and die enough times to know when and where every enemy will spawn you could probably get through it, but does that sound fun to you?","January 30, 2015","false","1.0"," 46 of 46 people (100%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","100","46","46","4","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Skops/recommended/321030/","Skops","Skops","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Skops/","405 products in account","It doesn't take one long to figure out One Day for Ched is a brutal game. 95% of the user reviews here don't even play the game longer than 20 minutes. Alas, I have spent time with it, and have seen the game to completion... Twice. I've seen it all, and what there is, isn't worth the frustration and mental pain to experience in this game.\n\nGRAPHICS:\nYou might be fooled into buying this game because of the screenshots on the store page. 1DC has a cell shaded asthetic that looks a lot like it was going for a Borderlands look, and to a certain degree, it succeeds. However, the rest of the textures are so flat and bland that it actually looks downright awful at times. There are hallways in the game long enough that the games draw distance just hard blurs it out. Enemies also just look poor. They don't even have textures, they have certain shapes such as demons, imps, and weird grey grunty things. but aside from their shape they just get colors.\n\nGAMEPLAY:\n1DC claims to be a classic FPS game. It's main way of conveying this is that the combat is fast paced, and instead of using cover, you strafe back and forth to avoid enemey fire. Its problems start with that enemy projectiles are either too numerous, or completely invisible and impossible to dodge. Second problem is that being hit more than twice will result in death. Many players have stated that God Mode is required to complete levels beyond 2, and I have to agree.\n\nSOUND:\nAll of sounds in the game are standard Unreal 3 Dev kit stuff. Guns sound good, but a few of them sound the same. Music in game is nearly non-existant apart from boss battles, and what their is, isn't good. The second boss theme is actually a Jack-in-the-Box theme... unbelievable. Voice acting here is atrocious.. I wouldn't be shocked if it was one of the Devs themselves doing the lines and English is not their first language.\n\nSTORY:\nChed is drunk. Very very drunk. He passes out in the middle of the street and within his subconcious, Ched must battle and destory his inner demons in his own 4 Floors of Hell before sunrise or else he'll succumb to alcohol poisoning and die in his drunken sleep... Or at least, I think thats whats going on.\n\nIt's an extremely short story with just FIVE missions in the game. It takes less than one hour to complete the campaign. There is an extra DLC episode, but if you play through the game you won't want to play it.\n\nOVERALL:\nI own a lot of games. Over 500 in fact. That list includes some of the worst to grace the industry (Sonic 2006, Rogue Warrior, AMY, Tunnel Rats, etc.) and despite all of those; One Day for Ched is by the WORST of them. This is easily the worst game I have ever played and own.. and thats not hyperbole.","January 8, 2015","false","1.7"," 37 of 37 people (100%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","100","37","37","4","1"

Ched sounds like a less interested tommy Wiseau and the quality of the recordings is horrible. I swear one clip sounds like you can hear the mouse being clicked to end the recording.\nthe game play is an fps, i guess it wants to be like a shooter of old with health packs fast movement and giving you lots of guns at the start (they are just thrown on the floor and one says new bonus???)\nthe problem is you die in like 2 hits so instead of getting close, you need to stay back and just fire, its very dull. getting hit if you dont die in one hit has little to no feedback or way of you knowing. the guns have no recoil or any kind of feel to them. the random muddy mess of strange creatures that spawn in have no real outstanding features. murky and brown. also form a distance it is hard to tell what is alive or dead as bodys kind fail around and clip into the floor. the crosshair flashes red whenever you shoot not when you hit things which is odd too.\nAnyhow i got to the first boss which just shoots you instantly. you are meant to wait out a certain time, which would just require you to fall back and wait.\ncant really see any reason to carry on ive seen enough already.\nThis should not be sold for money and how it got on steam at all AS a full price game not even early access is amazing.

It's bad, it's pointless, it's paintakingly hard as it gives no hint to anything whatsoever.\n\nYou want an oldschool schooter that is actually good? Try Duke Nukem Megaton edition. Or maybe Shadow Warrior if you want more oriental setting with possessed ninjas and chineese ghosts. Or maybe Hexen. Or Powerslave (for PSX that is). Or Doom 1, 2, Final Doom. Or Painkiller. Or Serious Sam...\n\nI believe you get the drill.\n\nThis „shooter” does not have any reedeming qualities. Graphics are bad, gameplay is pointless, combat is hard and random.\n\nI've got it in some bundle thus it didn't hurt me as much as if I would've bought it. Please consider most of the negative reviews out there - if you die in the first 10 seconds of the game without knowing what's going on here then this should give you a hint about the quality of this „game”.\n\n----------\nFor anyone interested in joining in on completing your own backlog; check it out here - http://steamcommunity.com/groups/completingthebacklog/discussions/5/530645446320364338/","January 13","false","0.2"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","14","16","0","0"

Right now "One Day For Ched" is only 1,50 but it's still way too much for this game. The screenshots look OK but even I could make a Unreal 3 engine game look good.\n\nOne Day For Ched is a First Person Shooter that tries to be a bit like the game 'Painkiller', meaning everytime you enter an Arena, a counter goes off and some mobs appear you obviously have to kill.\n\nRight from the start you will notice how bad and ... well... weird this game is. You're apparently some kind of drunk/alcoholic guy because the first line in the game says "I'm drunk, I'm very very drunk" voiced by a bad German voice actor. Afterwards, you can pick up some guns from the floor before the counter ends, the door opens and....... Oh you're dead... ? Apparently you have to find cover right from the start otherwise you're dead instantly.\n\nThe second try you take some cover and hope for the best. After you've killed your enemies (they are able to kill you in 1 shot) you go to the next room and repeat the same thing again. The shootouts are silly and unsatisfying, creatures look weird (and not in a good way), awful voice acting and i'm pretty sure there's no real story.\n\nTo say One Day For Ched is a bad game is an understatement and I don't mean 'So bad , it's Good'. The whole game feels like (and probably is) it is made by some German college kid. There's absolutely no fun playing this game, torture would be a more appropiate word.\n\n","December 22, 2014","false","0.1"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

It's hardly a game - it's like you're watching your favorite Twilight™ film. It has very deep, emotional characters with groundbreaking acting. There is a meaning behind this; something deeper than just a day for Ched. It demonstrates the emotional pain Ched has gone through, a mental war, if you will. Ched is an alcoholic - he becomes highly intoxicated in this title. He has experienced more negativity in this one day, than the entire life of a Black Veil Brides® scene girl. He will arm himself with various firearms to fight the demons that haunt his inner self. There is nothing to be said negatively about this game, it has not a single bug in all of the hours I've played. There are so many routes and methods to go about your objective, probably more routes than in every Dishonored mission combined.\nOverall, 9.69 out of 10.

All you have to do is run and shoot. Control in the game is simple and you don't have long to get used to the game. The game has 2 game modes - story mod and DLC. If you love a good story line - choose story mod. In DLC The player must go through a level and kill everyone they meet until they reach the end of the level. Additionally, it has quite possibly the widest variety and sheer scope of weapons available in first person shooters. Also worth noting assofermet games. Here it is made at the highest level. To cut a long story short, this is a great game.\nIf you like shooter game, I advise you to play it.

The main character is poorly voiced and it is quite annoying.\n\nAs for gameplay, the game is so unbelievably hard that it gets frustrating after the first 10 minutes of playing it.\n\nSo is it worth buying?
