Brilliant and simple in its design, you are tasked with allocating resources to make people happy. I love the visuals (the townsfolk particularly) and the ship battles, to name only a few aspects of this gem of a game. If you like civilization/city building games, this one is probably for you. There are always tons of side missions to do that you can pick up at the taverns and there is a ton of useful automation in the game (auto trading ftw). One of my favorite games of all time, so glad I picked it up for a few bucks. Watching the effect your efforts have on the landscape (cities, populations, developments) is very rewarding.

Simply brilliant. Calls for lots of tweaking and micro management, but not in a way a becomes tedious to do so. Just enough to give you the feeling you are doing exactly what is needed. Various levels of play make the game challenging for all levels. I think I will still be playing this in 30 years from now (when no decent successor surfaces). The best of the series, better than earlier AND later versions of Patrician.

If you're the kind who likes hours of tedious building and trading than this is a good game for you. If you like heart pumping action and need your games to excite and amaze you then this game is not for you. The beauty of Patrician 3 is in it's long term gameplay which has you slowly work your way from a humble trading shopkeeper to a master merchant. It does this through good AI, an excellent economic model, brilliant pacing, and diverse challenges. It's a game that know what it wants to do and does it better than most other economic simulation.","December 26, 2013","true","139.9"," 55 of 57 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","55","57","0","0"

Action game fans... probably should look elsewhere.\n\nUnlike Uncharted Waters, you control a whole company, safely ensconced in your corporate headquarters, while directing whole fleets of ships to run trade routes.  Once you build up a set routine route, you can even just automate the route, so that the ship sails between up to around a dozen ports buying and selling the same things over and over for a profit.\n\nThe best aspect of the game, however, is how much of a subtle, but ever-growing impact you have on the world with your actions.  The more you trade with a city, the more it prospers economically, the more its population rises, the more it has to trade, but the more it needs to trade to get products it doesn't manufacture, itself.  Then, you can outright build a branch office in a city, build up your own personal industries, and outright control the whole city.\n\nIt's dirt cheap at sale prices, and if you have any interest in the genre at all, it's worth looking into before going into more pricey, more modern versions of the same game.","November 30, 2013","true","35.6"," 66 of 74 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","66","74","0","1"

Did you play Uncharted Waters on NES or SNES as a child? Did you also play Sim City? Are you German? Do you like business sims? If you answered no to at least 2 of these, Maybe not.\n\n2. Do you like time sinks? Slightly hard learning curves? Micro managment?  If you answered no this game probably isn't for you.\n\n3. Do you love building an empire? Fighting pirates? Trading sims? Well it might just be.\n\nIf you are even reading this review then you somehow stumbled over this game and it might actually be for you, Patrician III has a steep learning curve but is a great empire building game but it is a time sink the like of which diehard WOW players can be jealous of.\n\nPros: You are responsible for everything that happens to you. Your empire (or failure to build one) is enirely on your shoulders. It is addictive and engrossing and gives "one more turn" a run for it's money.\n\nCons: It's a complicated game and actually requires you to learn things (not a con for me but maybe for you). Getting the screen ratio to work on anything past windows 98 requires googling (it works but ♥♥♥♥ if it isn't a pin in the ♥♥♥)\n\nEpilogue: Buy it. With steams new refund policy if you cant find enjoyment within a couple hours it probably isn't the game for you. For the rest of us? We will own the Hanse.","August 30, 2015","true","113.8"," 26 of 27 people (96%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","96","26","27","8","1"

Due to this excessive exposure to balance sheets and ratios I find a perverse need to accrue profits: by any means necessary.\n\nSo, whip out a notebook. Get a highlighter, a quill and some ink. Perhaps make some candles. Then light them, because you are about to embark on a deep dive into medieval trade federations and in this darkness you will need all the light you can get.\n\nThis game needs calculations, more guides would be nice. If you are not smart with expansion and diversification you will find yourself doing a lot of needless port grinding. However, if you can record the proper sales prices/buying prices, recruit a captian, and send convoys out abroad.. you may be on to something.\n\nI love everything about this game. The AoEII graphics, the polish (Whaaat? polish? you must be crazy) No, for reals. The attention to detail is very nice: in game oddities like marriage, hiring pirates, and borrowing/loaning money for negotiable interest can make or break your game in the best way. These types of additions allow you to pursue the main campaign quest (becoming Patrician) in unorthodox ways.\n\nLoaned money? "The guy can't make ends meet." Seize his assets. "Whats he got?" Loads of Wood. "♥♥♥♥" Build fleet of Snaikka and sell it to pirates. Get all the booty.\n\nContinuely refine trading routes and expand until you have too much money, build fleets and bribe princes. Pillage ports. Make more money, build more fleets. Invade mediterranean sea.\n\n11/10 would watch for police while hiring pirates again.

FIVE.  And they still leave a lot to be answered.... Needless to say, the game is COMPLICATED.  Plan on looking a LOT of things up on youtube and asking the community questions.\n-Attacking pirates are ALWAYS more powerfull.  You're either out-numbered, out-gunned, outmanned, or all three.  VERY frustrating, as the "Flee" option almost never works.\n\nThe trade system is top notch, They do a REALLY good job of balancing the economic system.

It could have been done better. Firstly, you need to stare in the small letters at the bottom of the screen and reading this is quite tiring. Secondly, not all the instructions are clear. Also, there's no control system that would check if a player did the requested action correctly. The  tutorial is rather some kind of a guide book rather than a tutorial. Reading it all can take you up to 2  hours. Also, the tutorial doesn't explain everything, so it's wise to try a free game after the tutorial before getting to the campaigns. This will help you to learn the game by trial and error.\n\nGraphics is not so great but it is decent and it reminds me of those games in the nineties. This can be a virtue as well as fault. Depends on what you like. The idea is simple: try to be the best merchant in the world. It turns out not to be so easy as you could have thought at first.\n\nThe game is challenging and even you know which city needs what kind of goods, it's still not easy to get rich. The clock is ticking and you need to act fast and with conviction. Learning the game will last a few hours as the tutorial is more about controls than substance of the game.

Apply this on the executable (steamapps folder) and it should work, for me it did.\n\nI played the game in my childhood and unlike some other games it was instantly fun to play again. The trading aspect is a bit monotonous but this also makes this game easy to play and to get into. Changing prices and finding out where to sell high and buy low makes this game fun. Of course you can adjust the difficulty settings to make things a bit more challanging if you wish to.\nHere is basically what you do: Take a ship and sail from harbor to harbot and sell and buy goods by different prices. You can have more ships over time and have to deal with pirates at some point. Prices vary but there are towns with high and low production of each good. Furhtermore you can build warehouse in towns and even production facilities to produce your own goods and make profit with those.\n\nI like that the game offers new challanges and opportunities over time. I think there is even times of war in towns and such special times offer new opportunities for you as a merchant.

Buy some goods, transport them to another town, avoiding pirates, and sell the goods for a profit. Rinse and repeat until you have a trading fleet, then some them on auto-trade to do the work for you. When you have enough cash, you can start building businesses and houses for additional income. You have to really pay attention to trade routes once you have businesses, because they can sink you fast if goods sit in warehouses for too long.\n\nSupply a town with enough goods for long enough, and you can become the Lord Mayor of the town. Do missions for the Hanse, and you can become Alderman, the top position in the game.\n\nOverall Patrician 3 is a great game, especially for the price. Late game is pretty much devoid, once you become Lord Mayor and then Alderman there is nothing to do with those positions. You just call meetings as an Alderman or defend your town from sieges as a Lord Mayor. Cash is only useful for buying ships/goods/buildings, so stockpilling cash at late game is rather pointless. Still, the fun lies in building your trade empire from nothing.\n\nNOTE: This game is currently in a bundle with two other games. I haven't played the other two games, but the bundle is only $3 more and the other game goes for $10, so I would buy that bundle instead of just this game.","March 16","true","93.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Apparently, I just don't have what it takes to be good at it and advance to make it enjoyable past the point I have reached. I became frustrated after 26 hours of trying and gave up for now. I only plan attempting it again when I am bored, between other games, or when the longing for it surfaces again. It is not a matter of a negatively constructed learning curve. In fact, learning how to play is not an issue at all. There are five tutorials, and they do an okay job at introducing the player to the game. The first campaign focusing on player advancement also instructs and gives hints appropriately, even though not with very much detail as to how to accomplish certain more convoluted aspects of the game. Even after consulting one extensive Wiki and three FAQ pages online, the game is still too difficult for me to succeed in. I've tried, once again, for 26 hours, every strategy and approach known to the experts, and I still would not succeed. The other AI controlled merchants in the game were light years ahead of me. All of the more in-depth reviews seen here are true and accurate. I just simply became frustrated at being mediocre or worse in the game, after 26 hours of trying. The game is difficult to be successful in. It's as simple as that. Perhaps this is a game that requires much more patience, and many more hours to be fully enjoyable.\n\nPatrician III is okay.","March 20, 2014","true","31.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's a pretty sad day when you need a patch from your competition to make the games you sell on your own site work. I am disappoint, Steam. Very disappoint.","March 15, 2014","false","5.1"," 20 of 46 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","20","46","0","2"

A mouse pointer leaving trails of ghost images of itself until it has clogged the screen.  Menues that are invisible until you run the cursor over them.  Producing a kind of rubing image that you may be able to interact with if the afformentioned mouse cursor ghost images do not obscure what your are looking at too much.  The readme file links unoffical patches for Voodoo graphics cards, so if you're still rocking one of those you may be in luck.

Economies can be chaotic (where someone just floods a market and you have to wait for it to dry up before it's profitable again).  I'm always feeling like I'm on the verge of losing, and by some miracle it continues.\n\nSome strategies do turn out to be a complete disaster and I have to revert to a previous save to continue.\n\nThe game mechanic feels "like German engineering" - meticulously detailed and almost overwhelming.\n\nThe game sort of reminds me of my first all-nighter game-plays of Civ II - where there is a grandiousity that can be achieved with many parallel elements in play.  I'm just beginning to get glimpses of that "big" feeling the game has to offer.\n\n\nPROGRAMMING\n-----------------------\n\nYou don't have to, but the game includes all the mechanisms needed to program ship routing (similar to programming resource shipping in Sid Meier's Colonization).  It's very satisfying to set up a stable system that allows going into fast forward and just rakes in the money.\n\n\nYES/NO?\n-------------\n\nI highly recommend it - but only if you are in no hurry.  I get the feeling this game could take hundreds of hours just for one or two games after having mastered it.  It's mind-bogglingly slow, with a million things to keep track of.","September 2, 2014","true","80.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It sets the stage for later, more developed, titles like Port Royale (which oddly is seen in the second preview screenshot above).\n\nWhat do you do in the game? Quite a bit. Trade is only the beginning, and the player is only a small part of the greater game, where the local royalty, the chuch, pirates, the Hanseatic League, and other traders all play a role. Hunt down competitors on the high seas as a pirate, run goods around the North sea in a small trading ships, build and control towns and the Hanseatic league, lead huge convoys across the map and on expeditions.\n\nSea combat is conceptually interesting, if functionally uninteresting at times, such as when your ship going 6 knots chases another ship at 6 knots. Ships may be fast and quick to run, or heavily armed with cannon, or somewhere in-between with ballistae and catapults.\n\nBlah blah, try it out if you're into trading sims.

It has a quite large learning curve, but once  you are past it the game becomes really fun. This game is all about management and rising through the ranks, you can be a simple trader or Lord Mayor, and have a fleet of ships at your disposal. You can specialize cities and what you trade, or just trade everything. Some people have trouble getting it running though, but it has decent replayability once you decide to finish your playthrough. One annoying thing that I find is that it crashes sometimes. If you're not into alot of management it might not be the game for you, but if you don't want to just trade, you can become a pirate and plunder, capture, and sink ships as well as raid towns for a lot of gold. Also as a trader you have to defend yourself from pirates, so you need to arm your ships.  If I had to score Patrician 3 myself I'd give this game a 7 or 8 out of 10.","October 3, 2014","true","82.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Runs well on modern machines and the interface is not very complex. Concurrently satisfies these urges: play a game, own a ship, buy low, sail the seas, sell high, and not file taxes.\n\nPro: think, click, and amass wealth\nCon: does not feed your real children","May 25","true","9.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

My all time favorite. Steam crashes to much for me, but it could only be that I'm on Windows 10. It takes forever to get the drivers and settings to play on w10. Still the best game I know of. Would love to have a 8 member p3 game club. Play every week same time 2-3 hours. All trying to be alderman. Who can have the most private towns. I think 3 can be started. Mayor in 1, and be permanently owner of 3 others.","May 28","true","158.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are ways. I personally recommend this: https://steamcommunity.com/app/33570/discussions/0/35221584425332491/\n\nThere are not many games so enjoyable even 16 years after release. I am still coming back to this game every few years and spend 30 to 100 hours.\n\nWhat is so special about Patrician 3? It was made by a German developer with GREAT care and a lot of love paid to details. It has nice 2D graphics, good sound effects and amazing gameplay.\n\nThere is a well-simulated economy and a huge variety of activities to immerse oneself into. A feast for the mind. If you know how good it feels to excercise your mind, you will fall in love with this game.\n\nThis games teaches you that if you care about people and make them happy, you can rise in society. You can also rise if you care about your town and improve it. You can also rise if you outsmart your competition and expand your company. You can also rise if you are a crap of a person but know which strings to pull and how to manipulate the public opinion. Just like in real life.\n\nNone of your actions here remain unnoticed. Reputation is the key.\n\nThe "dark side" is also possible. Get ready for pirating, bribes and brutal politics.\n\nYou will like this game if you like developing things and making something better.\n\nPatrician 3 is so rewarding and so well-made that I would recommend it to anyone, who likes economic simulators, ships, business development and products made with a lot of love and care.\n\nP.S.: Every time you return to game (i.e. load), make sure you take a bath and pray at the church. You are welcome.","June 6","true","46.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
