Yes, you read that right. A game for blind people.\n\nSTORYYou play as Edward Blake, a blind knight who, helped by his young daughter, goes on a quest to save his wife who has been kidnapped by an evil king.\nIn the game you will go to different locations, and you will find bandits, wolves and fantasy creatures. It's pretty standard fantasy game stuff.\n\nGRAPHICSAs you might guess... there aren't any. There is a constant smoke effect, with the occasional game logo when it's loading a new section. Other than that, you are literally blind.\n\nGAMEPLAYYou use the arrow keys to move, SHIFT and CTRL to run or walk, ENTER to draw your sword and use the arrow keys to attack, and F to use your shield which can block enemy attacks and environmental objects. Of course, all of this while being blind.\nIn order to know where to go, you can either listen to the environment or press SPACEBAR to make your daughter speak so that you can follow her. At first, this game felt more like a QTE adventure, but the more I played it, the more I got immersed in it and it turned into a really fun action-adventure game, avoiding obstacles and fighting monsters. This is a very original concept that has been executed masterfully!\n\nCHALLENGEThe combat is very easy at first, but gets harder after a while: enemies will move during combat, and depending on where they are located, you must press the corresponding arrow key. When there are more enemies, it gets even more fun. There are only a handeful of fights that kinda frustrated me, but the game balances the difficulty very well.\n\nSOUNDThe sound has to be great for a game like this, and here it is excellent: footsteps, wolves howling, waterfalls, entering a cave... Everything feels extremely realistic. And the voice acting is very good as well, with your typical British Game of Thrones accents.\n\nREPLAYABILITYThere is a Hard mode that increases the difficulty in the combat sections, but other than that there aren't extras.\n\nOverall, this is a brilliant concept that works very well especially if blindfolded. I highly recommend this game to everyone, especially who's looking for a new twist on gaming. This is basically the anti-VR game, and I love it!\n\nStory: 7.5\nGraphics: n/a\nGameplay: 9\nChallenge: 9\nSound: 10\nReplayability: 6\n\nENJOYMENT: 9\nFRUSTRATION: 5\nFollow me on Twitter: @nickygra97\nSubscribe to my channel\nLike on Facebook\nJoin my Steam group","April 7","true","2.8"," 115 of 140 people (82%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","82","115","140","13","0"

The computer automated voice in the beginning is horrid. It is amazingly annoying and almost made me want to stop playing the game. After I got throught the tutorial it became fun. Just get through the beginning and the rest is extremely fun and I am having a great time playing it so far. Its fun to just close my eyes and listen. Very creative game. I can say for the first time in a long time that this is something I have not experienced before in a game. That to me is worth the 5$ I paid\n\n8/10\n-2  becuase they should have just gotten a voice actor to do the job of the computer voice.

I can overlook listening to my daughter character repeating the same directions over and over again. I can't however accept that I'm fighting a troop of knights, who thankfully have some variant in their voice and personality, but still have the same attack and death sound. I know this is just nitpicking, but it just feels extremely lazy, especially since sound plays such an important role in the game.\n\nAnother problem I had with the game is that it actively tries to stop you from getting immersed. The Tutorial/Guide voice is very annoying and there was no option in the settings to disable it. It really sucks when you took the time to blindfold yourself in a dark room and covered your ears with a decent pair of headphones and your adventure is ruined by a semi-robotic female voice going “LOADING”.\n\nMechanics wise, it's ok. They were creative in painting the world around you. The sound of your footstep change depending on where you are, the background noises are often filled with subtle sounds to make the world seem alive. Utilizing the daughter character as a marker was also a smart workaround to enable players to move around the game world. However, the maneuvering could use a little tweaking. You could take a wrong turn, and on asking your daughter where to go, she will simply repeatedly tell you to TURN RIGHT. You’re better off playing it by ear, and try to get closer to her voice. Controls are responsive but the combat system felt a bit too simple. The story isn’t too bad and your daughter sounds like a cute girl, so things are probably pretty good.\n\nOverall, if you’re looking to just sate a curiousity, then this game would probably be enough to sate it (and the price point is quite fair). However, if you were unfortunately looking to put yourself in the shoes of a blind knight, you will have to look elsewhere.\n","April 8","false","0.5"," 41 of 63 people (65%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","65","41","63","2","10"

A video game I play with my aural system not my occular system? Foolishness. But yeah, nah, it's actually solid and really easy to pick up once you get going. I see a lot of pro and con lists in the comments so I'll jump on that bandwagon:\n\nPros:\nBlindfolding yourself to play a video game is such a unique experience and personally I enjoyed the new medium to paint the world around me with audio instead of visuals.\nThe voice acting is bloody firm.\nThe ambient sounds that make the areas feel alive are beautifully done.\nHearing your daughter's voice shout "Over here" for the nth time isn't grating, strangely.\nThe combat is interesting, sure it's the same thing over and over again but the pattern recognition is pretty fun.\nNeutral:\nIt's short. like 2.5 hours short, probably even faster if you're actually good at games, unlike myself. This is both good and bad and I'll talk more about it below these lists.\nIf you do happen to watch the screen during the fight scenes, on a successful hit the screen flashes, good because it shows a successful hit, reaaaaally bad if you've been blind folded for an hour and your eyes are just readjusting to the light.\nCons:\nThat f**king robot voice, man. It makes me want to go on a quest for vengance, just like Blake.\nThere's no variation in the death sounds.\nHits don't always connect when they should (Although I suspect this will be addressed in a future patch)\nRandom deaths. I mean, like I mentioned before, I'm a visciously average gamer, so it could just be that I suck. But on two or three occasions I like straight up died. I get why, in hindsight it makes sense but (SPOILER)  There's one scene where your daughter shouts "Over here" and I ran straight toward here and was insinerated by a geizer\n- So yeah, the length is good and bad, it's good because after 2.5 hours of sitting there with your eyes closed and not going to sleep your eyes get bored and wander all over the shop, making you sleepy, plus for £3.99 I didn't exactly expect 40 hours of gameplay. It's bad because even though the story gets wrapped up nicely, I kinda wanted more, I wanted to at least walk Blake home after how hard he got f**ked because of me, least I could do.\n\n---------------------------------------\nIs it worth your money?\nYe.\n\nIt's alright.\n\nPerfect 5/7.\n\nIt's less than a fiver and it's longer than a movie at the cinema (and like 4 times cheaper).","April 13","true","2.5"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","100","12","12","4","0"

Developed by Dowino, A Blind Legend is an action-adventure game in which you have to rely on your ears to defeat enemies. As a result, a good pair of headphones will be necessary. If you do have a good pair of headphones, then you’re in luck, as you will be able to take part in this sensory experience.\n\nImmediately upon booting up the game for the first time, you realise that there is no menu, and you must rely on your hearing to even start up the game. In fact, there are no screens anywhere in the game, the entire screen is always filled with a thick fog. This doesn’t break from the immersion of the game, but instead you’re left to wonder why the developers decided to include the annoying robotic voice that guides you through the tutorial and menu. Not only does this break the immersion a lot, but it also leaves you with a desire to start your own quest for vengeance to hunt down this robot voice and put it out of its misery. Annoying immersion breaking robot voice aside, the tutorial is relatively short and the controls are quite easy to learn.\n\nThe story follows the tale of Edward Black, a famous blind knight, guided by his daughter. The plot is fairly clichéd, as it is a rather tried and tested story about saving your wife from the evil king. The entire story lasts around 2 hours and there is little motivation to revisit the story.Whilst, the plot is rather clichéd, it must also be said that it works well here. The plot flows quite effortlessly and some good voice acting means it doesn’t get annoying when you hear your daughter yell “over here” for the 12th time. The sound design in general is great in this game, as it should be. The ambient noises are clear and distinct, making the game quite relaxing at times, almost like an interactive audiobook.\n\nMoreover, the combat in this game is fairly mundane at the beginning of the game, as its rather easy to block the enemy hits and kill them. The controls really shine here, as all you have to do is listen carefully for the sounds your enemies make and attack the corresponding direction. The enemies sure grunt like tennis players, making it feel rather easy early on to guess where they are and quickly dispatch them with coldblooded efficiency. The combat does get slightly challenging in the latter stages of the games, as you start getting surrounded and poked around from all sides, making you feel like a piñata at a kid’s birthday party. Keep in mind that this isn’t Dark Souls for the blind, so it never gets too challenging. The moderate curve actually keeps the game quite accessible to the more casual players.\n\nOverall, an innovative idea from the developers and one that many people can enjoy if they are able to look past the horrible robot voice and the rather short story. This game might not appeal to you if you want a fast-paced shooter or a quick fix, but it will appeal to you if you want to try something innovative. The accessible nature of the game is definitely one of the game’s strongest points coupled with the $8 price of the game and the stellar sound design means that the game is worth your attention if you want to try something different for a change.","May 12","true","1.9"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","7","7","2","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mastatsan/recommended/437530/","mastatsan","Carlz0r","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mastatsan/","1578 products in account","Quick thoughts on my experience so far.. It's an interesting game, but it's not that great. Here's why.\n\n1. The robot voice that tells you how to play is annoying.. it seems to speak less and less as you play, but it completely takes me out of the experience every time it pipes up.  If there must be a voice speaking to me, the player, at least make it a real voice. This is the worst thing so far.\n\n2. There isn't a big enough variety of sounds.. for a game that is 100% based on sound, it kinda annoys me that the thugs that attacked me made the same noises every time they were going to hit me, and the same sound every time I hit them... wolves have the same noises every time they run up, attack, and get hit as well.   It needs at least a few different versions of each sound.. both for variety, and challenge.\n\n3.  It's really hard to determine how much you're turning.. Too easy to under- or over-estimate.  Even when using the sounds around me as clues, This is still a bit of a problem.  Limitation of the hardware and controls, I suppose.\n\n\nOther than that, it's pretty alright I guess.  It's an interesting experiment.  I don't think this is the first time I've played something like this, but it's certainly a rarity in any case.\n\nWould I recommend it?  I'm going to hit "no" only because I think the vast majority of people out there won't really be into it, and because of the flaws listed above..  But if you're the type of person, like me, who likes to try interesting stuff (or if you're actually blind) go for it.","April 8","false","0.3"," 27 of 48 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","27","48","0","2"

I used my Razer Kraken 7.1  Chroma headphones, and oh was it awesome. I could tell exactly where those mercenaries, wolves, and that one bear near the beginning that were all trying to kill me were. The ambient sounds that make up the "scenery" were also excellent. And this was just in a few minutes of playing the game. (I basically gushed over how awesome this was, then got out of the game to write a review. Also, this is my first review, so I apologize if I messed up the formating or anything like that.) I haven't tried it with other headphones yet, but the sound was amazing with 7.1 headphones. However, there are some things to take into consideration.\n\nPros:\nAn experience like no other ever presented in a video game.\nThe voice acting is pretty good, so far it hasn't bothered me at all.\nThe sounds are phenomenal.\nThe combat is pretty interesting, when I first saw this, I was thinking "How do you fight?", but they answer this question by making the sound of the attack prompt you when to strike. Kinda like a QTE, but with no visual prompt.\nNeutral\nIt's pretty short, so depending on how good you are, it could go by pretty quickly.\nIt can take a little while to learn when to strike in combat, some players might get a little frustrated with it.\nCons:\nAt least in English, the robotic voice can be pretty annoying. This may push some people away from the game, as it can break the immersion.\nFor those people who really dislike QTE games, the combat could turn them off, as it's basically an sound version of a QTE.\nThe death sounds are pretty similar, there's not much difference between them.\nAll in all, I recommend A Blind Legend mostly for the experience. It's just so unique compared to pretty much every other game out there, not to mention fun. If you have good headphones, just buy it. You won't regret it. And even if you don't have the nicest headphones, just give it a whirl for the expereience. It's definitly worth your money.","April 19","true","0.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","2"

I'm not that type of a guy who needs to have a public opinion on everything.\n\nAnd maybe just that is the reason why I immediately fell in love with this game. I haven't had an opportunity to really get into it yet, but I already can say for sure that this game is worth trying, even if for the few minutes in the beginning that show you how the world works. It's something quite different compared to most of other games, and I also think it's somehow nice and symbolic that an entirely audio-based game was made basically at the moment of the dawn of VR, which is focusing mainly on visuals, of course.\n\nBy the way, there's a quick summary down at the bottom. :)\n\nBut to compare the subjects more, I think this game has similar kind of issues that VR games are having right now. The visuals in VR aren't quite as perfect as on PC's... But thanks to it's mindblowing space complexity, it doesn't matter. And this game, A Blind Legend, has similar issues with the audio. The complexity of the sounds is well thought out and made, as you can say from other reviews and also from getting even only 5 minutes into the game. But the semi-robotic voice everybody here is talking about is very disturbing, as is the repetitiveness of certain phrases and noises made by characters in the game (although this isn't as bad, one can get over it relatively well with a bit of tolerance and generosity). But I would say that this could be the potential start of another kind of games (and I might be wrong here, but I've never heard of a game played entirely by audio before, so I'm sorry if I put wrong information in this review), which could expand and improve over time. And that's awesome, come on. :)\n\nIf I would recommend this game... I'm gonna hit yes. Mainly it's because of my opinion that nobody should refuse to try a new thing, that doesn't do anything bad or wrong to anybody. Trying new things moves you forward. And this is just an interesting concept, and I'm sure it will never fit everybody; after all, no game has ever accomplished that yet. But it's certainly worth trying, despite the awful robovoice of the guide and other imperfections. The experience this game will give you far exceeds the experience of many AAA titles, which is caused mostly by them being generic and not interesting at any aspect. These high-end, high-cost games won't bring you anything new, but it will be perfect if the only thing you want is to stay in your comfort zone.\n\nA Blind Legend won't give you that. It probably won't even be the most ground-breaking game you played, even if you don't play many games. But it will give you an another point of "view", an another potential way... and I think that's what is really important. If you don't like it, it's fine, everybody has his own opinion, no matter how hard passionate review writers try to sound convincing. But who knows, maybe it won't be that bad after all. :)\n\nPut simply: A Blind Legend is worth trying out, if you're only a tiny little bit willing to step out of your comfort zone and try something new and unusual (or well, probably not new and unusual to everybody. But for me it certainly was new :).\nIt has its flaws, I would never argue with that. The robotic voice of the guide is disrupting the experience a lot. But I'm sure this and other flaws can be worked on in the future, and even now they don't affect the game too hard.\nYou might not like it after all, and that would be perfectly understandable. I can't make you think what's good or bad, and frankly, nobody should. But I can give you my opinion, and you might listen to me and take something out of it. And that would be completely worth the hour I spent writing this review.\n\nI will say it one last time: Try it out, hear for yourself and make your own opinion. ;)","April 14","true","0.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

Right now. If you've gotten far enough as to see what other people are thinking, I promise you you won't regret it. I'd pay twice the price for half of the experience I just got from playing the first hour of it.\n\nThere is something incredibly special about this game. The combat is SO very fun, the characters are each incredibly fleshed out and relatable, and you TRULY feel like this badass blind knight taking down some mofos. Someone said the experience was equatable to being Daredevil, and it TRULY is.\n\nI went full monty and wrapped my eyes up and everything, and could BARELY see the flashing that indicates a confirmed hit. It was BREATHTAKING. As you walk, you hear the life around you, and I have been scratching my head trying to figure out how they achieved something so spectacular.\n\nThe couple of criticisms I DO have are fairly moot at the moment, as I haven't entirely finished the game. I think this game is a proof of concept of something that could flourish into an entirely unique genre of gaming. I can only imagine how INCREDIBLE this would be with the Occulus or the Vive's headtracking, turning your ears to listen to foes, and truly being surrounded by a world. Combat is fairly simple at the moment, but I think there is a LOT that could be done to make it more challenging and interesting.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kungharry/recommended/437530/","kungharry","-Johan-","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kungharry/","357 products in account","Playing without visuals is a very interesting mechanic, and occasionally it did work well. However, there is a very limited amount of different sounds (so you end up pushing buttons in response to whether the sound is to your left or right), and fighting is quite annoying. I gave up the game after I tried to defend some fishermen who had saved me - I simply wasn\'t sure if I was even hitting the monster, and I always ended up dying. Note that this means that I have not finished the game.\n\nYou can try the game\'s first levels out for free on your smartphone to get a feel for it, which I recommend. Playing on PC shouldn\'t add much to the experience.","June 1","false","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rogermorse/recommended/437530/","rogermorse","rogermorse","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rogermorse/","431 products in account","I am going to recommend this (one of the occasions where I miss one 'neutral' thumb) because the immersion is quite nice (close your eyes and use good headphones and disable all the filters on the soundcard like surround filters that would make the binaureal effects of the game totally ineffective) and different from all the other games I normally play. The development of the story is also quite nice and the gameplay mechanics can be repetitive (fights, mostly), but still challenging.\n\nBUT*******\n\nThe checkpoints are in the wrongest places. Sometimes you die to see yourself repeat the same long chunk of level over and over. Another big minus is a robotic voice that gives you hints on how to play (what normally would appear on screen in normal games). This stops the narration, breaks the immersion, and very often it's only to tell you some things that had already been said earlier in the game (combat moves and so on that you already know how to use....)","June 4","true","5.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
