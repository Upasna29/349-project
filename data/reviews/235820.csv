If you just look at the trailers or pieces of gameplay, you'll probably come to a conslusion that this is a very relaxing and soothing game. I'll clear that up in just a second.\n\nBut first. What exactly is the game? The mechanics are simple, technically it's even called a platformer... You travel different environments: rocky and green, fire with lava, icy and snowy, or watery. And you are an element. First you are a bubble of air, then you gain the ability to turn into a cube of ice, then a little rock, and finally a fire spark. Each form has other abilities and weaknesses. The only control you have, is the form you take. You don't really control the movement, you just turn into the right element in the right area to fly, swim, slide, or bounce around.\n\nThe mechanics are brilliant in their simplicity. You press up for air, down for rock, left for ice, and right for fire. That's all you have control of. So it should be pretty easy, right? A simple, pleasant game.\n\nWRONG! Honestly, I don't remember the last time I screamed, grunted, moaned, and cried this much during a game. Since the control is so minimal, you have to hit everything just right, at the right moment, with the right speed and angle. If you don't, you're screwed. Do over.\n\nI'm a rage game masochist. So I just completely adore this game, and can't pull myself away from it. But if you don't enjoy getting absolutely infuriated during a game, maybe you shouldn't try it.\n\nNow, apart from the brilliant mechanics, this game is just gorgeus. The environments are made in a beautiful, soft style. The elements are tiny, with an adorable little smiley kawaii face. The music is gentle and soothing, almost like a lullaby. And, every here and there, you get small remarks from the element that you are controlling, written somewhere on the screen. Like, when you are going underground the element mentions Gollum and the One Ring.\n\nSo the whole thing, looking objectively is really just cute, pretty, sweet and adorable.\n\nAnd then if you play it, and you aren't very adept at it yet, it's hell on Earth.\n\nI love it. If I haven't scared you off yet, try it. It's different, it's clever, it's difficult, and it's cute.","May 23, 2014","true","5.6"," 57 of 62 people (92%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","92","57","62","3","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sadlean/recommended/235820/","sadlean","Smáfuglar","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sadlean/","114 products in account","Platforming games are a thing of incremental progress in how they are built. Players will be dropped into a relatively familiar experience, and be given the basic principles of how the world operates. From that point it is the games responsibility to build upon those foundations and craft a game that continuously teaches you more and more about itself. This is usually in the form of gameplay mechanics or level design but it’s a technique that works, and has stood the test of time. Element4l is something that is trying to accomplish progress in both of those directions at the same time in ways that previous platforming games haven’t touched upon, all set to an affecting and beautiful soundtrack.\n\nLet’s start with the basics. You are a bubble. You will not remain a bubble, but you will begin as one. As this bubble, you will soon learn to become an ice cube. This is the transitive path to enlightenment, becoming an ice cube and all. Next you will learn to be as a stone; which is to say you will be a boulder. This will make you heavy as you may imagine, but heaviness is not enlightenment. So you will become a spark from a stone, and be as a flaming comet in the sky. This might be the path to enlightenment, who knows? Really the thing to take stock of here is that you will be four elements throughout this game, and you will have to traverse paths. Are they paths to enlightenment? No, not really, in fact they’re more likely paths to you having a minor heart attack…in a good way. If that sort of thing is possible.\n\n\nElement4l places you in the role of these four elements, and tasks you with moving from the left to the right. There are no enemies to speak of as you move from the left to the right, but the environment can and will kill you. You move from one end of the level to the other using nothing but the momentum that you are able to generate by switching the various elements on the fly, each possessing their own unique properties. As a bubble of air, you are obviously able to float, but you can also “bubble up” and give yourself an upward boost. As a block of ice, you can slide around on surfaces and gain ludicrous amounts of speed that would make a hedgehog jealous, provided you’ve got enough forward momentum going. Turning to a stone will give you some immediate downward force, and turning to a spark will fling you to the right for a brief moment.\n\nEach of these elements is controlled by a radial dial of energy that surrounds you at all times. Changing from one element to the other drains a certain amount of energy unless you are changing to an ice cube. In a subtle move of gameplay genius the developers wisely omitted an energy requirement to change to a block of ice, making sure you’ve always got something to fall back on. With all these things in place the game starts simply enough. Spark to the right, turn to a stone over a sloped piece of the level, and then quickly turn to ice. The resulting “wheeeeeeeeeee!” that escapes your mouth is elation. For a time that sense of discovery remains in place as the game continues to peel back layer upon layer of gameplay. Which is to say it gets deep pretty soon, and starts challenging your perception of movement in a general way. It’s a great gameplay device while it’s all about learning these new things. So the first time that you bounce off a lava surface to quickly reverse your direction and fling upside down as an ice cube, your mouth will upturn into a grin.\n\nHowever nothing lasts forever. Once the game is done showing you the operating principles behind the myriad of ways that you can move it takes the kid gloves off. Around the second chapter of the game, Element4l shows you that only through brutal painstaking trial and error will you ever achieve enlightenment. Solutions to movement puzzles become much less obvious and much more esoteric, and the explanations are few and far between. Is this an issue? It depends on how you look at it. On the one hand this game is the very core of what platforming is about. You take a basic mechanic like moving from the left of the level to the right of the level, and then you procedurally add to it. By the end of the experience, you should have challenged the player’s perception of that simple act of moving from one side of the screen to the other. Here’s where that’s going to be disarming for those interested in Element4l; the game is adorable. While you wouldn’t think this an obvious detriment right away, I think it might be. The cutesy graphics and art style suggest a much more casual experience than what really lies in wait here. So while the average player might be expecting something in line with Braid or Limbo, they’ll be surprised or dismayed to find that this game is basically Super Meat Boy with ice cubes.\n\n\n\n\n","November 30, 2013","true","16.3"," 46 of 50 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","46","50","0","0"

First of all you have the element air, as second element you will get ice, next one is rock and at last fire. You will switch through the elements with the arrow keys. Every change will lower your endurance except the change to ice, which doesn't cost any endurance. The endurance will reload automatically over a short periode of time. If your endurance is too low you can't change into another element. You have always to use the environment around you to finish the level.\n\nFor example: You have to get through two half-pipes in front of you. Therefore you will change to rock to raise your fall speed and just before you hit the entrance of the first half-pipe you will change to ice to slide through it. After you exit the half-pipe you will change to air to fly above the second half-pipe to repeat the actions again. This means that you have to react often very very fast to get the right speed/timing to fly/roll/slide to the next objective.\n\nThere are calm passages like slowly floating as air over lava or wet passages like sliding as ice through water or rolling down a track in a minecart as rock or bouncing as fire from one lava pit to another.\n\nYeah, that's it.\n\nPros:\n+ great game concept (like rock-paper-scissors)\n+ well designed physic engine\n+ tutorial available\n+ lovely designed levels (with usage of the rock-paper-scissors principle)\n+ non-frustrating autosave system\n+ atmospheric style\n+ good artwork and nice particle effects\n+ awesome sound scenery with calm appropriate music\n+ help system (never used)\n+ funny text messages with referrals to other games/movies (like 'The Goonies', 'Harry Potter', 'Indiana Jones' or RPGs)\n+ good chosen quotes (displayed at the beginning of each level)\n(+ steam achievements)\n\nCons:\n- some parts of some levels are hard as hell (in one level I needed over 100 respawns -.-)\n- no story, not even an abstract story\n(- no demo)\n\nRecommended, even if it's not on sale, because it's an fantastic game concept, which was lovely designed into a really enjoyable calm atmosphere.\n\n9/10","September 6, 2015","true","6.0"," 34 of 37 people (92%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","92","34","37","3","0"

It's beautifully done in both gameplay and atmosphere. The soundtrack is bloody amazing and goes along really well with the game.\n\nIt's not really long, then again, it's just got the right length in my opinion ... it doesn't overstay its welcome. You control a character (or rather 4) which can switch between fire, water (ice), earth (stone) and air (bubble). You race the tracks/levels with your character and need to switch quickly between the 4 forms in order to gain speed  (as an ice cube), jump over cliffs (as fire ball), ascend (as an air bubble) and roll down hills or destroy obstacles (as stone). Since some of the tracks are really fast paced you will have some tough passages to overcome. Thankfully the checkpoints are well placed. It's really like TRIALS but in cute, haha. But like in Trials you want to finish the track withouth 'dying' and reach the end in one go.\n\nA relaxing piece of gaming entertainment with a great atmosphere. Fair price, especially since you get the OST with the purchase of the game as well. What I liked especially were the comments of the developer which pop up occasionally in the game. Movie references and overall fun comments.\n\n10/10 control a cute Super-Skrull to rule the tracks\n\nEDIT: I forgot to mention that besides its fluffy cute look, it's beastly hard and quite challenging at times. However, all the whining in certain reviews and therefore negative ratings don't do ELEMENT4L justice - it's very doable and a lot of fun.","March 1, 2015","true","6.3"," 18 of 20 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","18","20","0","0"

It's definitely original! I personally did not enjoy this game but it might have some appeal to other kinds of people.\n\nStrangely enough, it reminds me of Dragon's Lair for the Sega CD. And I know exactly why. If you never played said game it works like this: you put the cd on and hit play, then a beautiful animation starts playing! cell shaded, disney quality etc. That's no intro or cutscene, that's the game. You have to press specific keys at specific moments to allow the movie to progress. It's a game 100% made of quicktime events, made before this term had been coined. And Element4l is exactly that under the hood; you have to press the correct key at the correct time, there's no margin for error and no flexibility at all. Again, some people may enjoy this but, if they exist, I hope it's not because of the movie playing because Element4l doesn't have that part.","May 7, 2014","false","0.8"," 46 of 70 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","46","70","0","0"

I love difficult games, I played through Meat boy and They will bleed pixels and died over and over again while having the time of my life. But somehow dying in Element4l is just no fun. You don't learn from death you just try till you beat the hard part. But oh wait, after this part there is another nearly impossible part that kills you 30 times.

The game will also make you smile at some moments, as Mr.Smooth says some funny things trough the game, which is something I rarely find in games.\n\nThe game itself can be rushed from the beggining to the credits in 4-6 hours but, where the game really shines is when you try to go for the gold medals and master the stages, this added to me possibly another 6-8 hours of fun.

I was a little dissapointed, but I still proceeded. And I'm glad I did. I like puzzles and challenges, and the puzzles in this game can be very hard. They wouldn't be with direct control, so I can see why the developer took away conventional controls, player sees the puzzle, thinks it's hard based on other games' controls, but when he/she tries to solve it, the controls come to play, and that's when it gets difficult. Along with unique controls, the game has cute, semi-realistic art style, and SO beautiful soundtrack. Music in games is under-rated in most AAA and big company games, but not in most indie games. And in this game, the soundtrack is so calming, relaxing, happy... Words cannot describe how wonderful soundtrack in this game is.\n\nSo, not for people who don't like puzzles, and for some players it may get a little repetitive, but for people like me, it's one of te best games in past few years.\n\n97%","November 13, 2014","true","2.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

But what I have played, has impressed me. I'm not big on puzzle-platformer types, but I adore this game regardless.\n\nThe Soundtrack is absolutely wonderful. It's so ambient and it REALLY fits the game. It genuinely makes you feel like you're solving a puzzle. There's some interesting, occasionally creepy sound-effects [childrens laughter] that definitely adds to the  very odd atmosphere. There's no real way to decribe the kind of atmosphere it generates. It's simply unique.\n\nThe Artwork/Aesthetic. It's gorgeous. Vibrant colour themes and pleasant contrasts. It's quite simply an interesting game to look at.\n\nThe gameplay is, not really for me. The game can get difficult very quickly, which is always an issue with puzzle-platformers. Certainly some levels are more intuitive than others. But it consistently provides a challenge. I imagine, at higher levels, it must feel fantastic to glide through the levels executing each move required perfectly. Sadly, I very rarely - often accidentally - replicate this feeling. It's usually the moment I realize how fluid the game feels that I die! The main issue for me is that when you do die, it really slows the gameplay. What is fluid when executed perfectly feels sluggish when you die, as you often re-spawn stationary, or with little momentum.\n\nBut I can't stress enough how polished it is, especially for an indie title. There's some lovely written commentary provided in-game as you pass certain obstacles. If you love puzzle-platformers and unique games, you'll like this game. Even if you don't, I'd argue it's worth buying for the soundtrack and aesthetic in-game. It's simply beautiful.

"Challenging" is not a word that even comes close to describing the experience that I encountered with this game. It was bought for me by a friend, so the desire to finish it, not just to its end, but to 100% was heightened. With eerie, yet beautiful colored backgrounds and darkened foregrounds Elemen4l can capture one's gaze with precision. The movement system, while challenging, has a precision all its own and requires immense skill in reaction timing and rhythmic pacing. A collection of wonderful cultural references mixed with exciting, and at many times, frustrating level span and design makes Element4l an absolute must for a determined gamer's collection. In closing, probably the most excellent aspect and feature of this game is the soundtrack. There are not words in existence that can describe how fantastic the music and sound effects are geared towards making Elemen4l an incredible experience. All in all, through frustration, determination, and all out giving up, Element4l most certainly made a better gamer out of myself.

I saw this game which I had no idea how it got there. In fact, I installed it knowing nothing about the game, so if you are reading this, you are one step ahead of me already! Anyway, I was thoroughly surprised to find this indie game to be very different, having just played FEZ and Braid. You control this thing which can turn into four elements: Fire, Air, Ice, and Rock. Utilizing these four elements, you traverse the levels, trying to use them in new and unique ways. This game plays very well, the controls respond well to you and the puzzles are, for the most part, fair. The checkpointing can be a bit rough sometimes but is mostly barable. I think the roughest part is momentum. You see, unless you become an expert, unlike me who did a casual run-through of the story, you will have trouble with keeping momentum. The game's help feature shows how you are supposed to do it but mostly frustrates you more as it plays out very differently, sometimes you need to come up with different strategies to get by. Lastly, if you are just playing the story levels, the game is very short, packing only sixteen levels.

The controls are great, albiet a bit strange. The concept is that instead of moving left, right, and jumping like in normal platformers you switch between four elements to navigate through levels, whether you need to go forward, fly a bit, or gain a little bit of weight.\nNot only does it have a nice concept, but the levels and music are butifully designed. The surrounding area adds a nice bit to the game, not very clearly marking where you go next (a good thing, by the way). There is only one soundtrack as far as I've played, but it's so long that I couldn't even tell that it was repeating constantly.\nFinally, the levels are ordered nicely. It never gives you anything you wouldn't be able to figure out due to previous shenanigans.  It gets harder and harder the farther you go, never dropping in difficulty. If you ever get stuck, you can always consult the 'help' button, and if you DO get stuck there are nice bits of text to lighten your rage levels.\nAnyone who has played the game can tell you it is a bit linear. There isn't much exploration (although there is still quite a bit if you want to get the lost soul thingies). This is only due to the control scheme, the makers couldn't have it many other ways.\nAll in all, this is a game worth getting. I will admit, I'm not yet sure if it's worth ten dollars, but five bucks is definitley underpriced for this gem.","April 7, 2014","true","7.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

All in all, this game is genius, creative, beautiful, scenic, and very rewarding. While on the other hand, the game is pretty excruciating to play through. If you like challenges, great music, perfect controls, great gameplay, and awesome physics; THEN BUY THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","January 18, 2014","true","4.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It’s really ruthless when it comes to making you feel helpless. [CD-Action 08/2013, p.81]"\n\nI will start off by saying I did enjoy it... for the first 20 minutes. But the learning curve is rediculous. Shortly after you learn all the elements the difficulty just goes through the roof past the moon and all the way to pluto. After a few deaths it gives you the option to press "h" which places a ghost you on the screen doing it the correct way. That's all nice and dandy, but at parts the tutorial ghost you will go off screen and you won't be able to see what to do next. On top of that, there is literally only one way to do it. If you do not copy exactly what the ghost does, you -will- die.\n\nThe physics... are off. Your momentum is something you will be constantly fighting with. As "air" you can only move about two seconds before all your forward momentum (typically right on the screen) completely disappears. You can use "fire" to get some momentum, but here is where (in my opinion) the worst mechanic lies. There is simply not enough energy. All your elemental forms cost energy except for ice. You can only use about three elements in quick succession before you are out of energy. So you have to perfectly time each use of your energy. If you're sliding as ice and need to use air to get up and to the right, you must switch to air exactly when the game wants you to. If you switch a half second too late you won't have enough momentum and you can't use air enough times to get high enough, or if you get high enough you won't have enough energy to use fire to get to the right. If you press it a half second too early then you will have too much momentum and you will crash into the wall and die.\n\nThis becomes quickly frustrating as more or less it is about just being lucky enough to hit the button at the right time. For the most part there was no guessing as to what to do next. With only four elements there was no confusion factor.\n\nThe other big flaw of the game is respawning. When you die, as you will most definitly die a lot, you respawn sometimes in seemingly random locations. You respawn as rock, which will almost immediatly slow your momentum, the most important factor in the game. If you spawned as ice, it wouldn't be quite so bad. Some places you spawn will be in a dead stop as well. This forces you to use air to get off the ground and then fire to get some momentum, which right off the bat uses up 2/3 of your energy.\n\nI really did want to like the game. It is aboslutely beautiful and the sountrack is amazing. But the actual gameplay is just torture. I finally quit when you start in a hole and have to go back and forth trying to build up your -you guessed it- momentum! in order to get out of it. The 'help' button was basically worthless.\n\nAll in all, I do not reccomend this game. If you're a masochist and love constantly dying while trying to figure out the exact timing the game wants, then this is for you. Otherwise I wouldn't pay any more than $0.25 for this game.","May 8, 2014","false","0.8"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

Most of the design was done well. There were a couple parts that felt tedious to progress through, but the world largely made sense. I may have preferred a different visual aesthetic, everything looked a bit dull, but I noticed that the visuals completely faded away from my mind while playing, freeing resources to focus on progressing through the world. The game didn't take itself too seriously, making silly comments every once in a while which lightened the mood. It's not my preferred kind of game, but it's a solid game for others.\n\nFor Linux users\nSteamworks isn't implemented for Linux, so you won't unlock achievements and, as far as I can tell, you won't be able to participate in the leaderboards.","June 22, 2014","true","2.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The concept of movement through levels by use of different elements; that's really creative. The are design is really soothing and the music is quite nice. However, my overall idea of this game is pretty negative. The game really feels like it was designed for a different physics engine as well as different controls. As far as the engine goes, it feels really 'heavy'. As in, I cannot move more than two centimeters on the screen without loowsing all of my momentum. I feel the game would be much better if there was a wind element causing momentum the entire time. Otherwise, the game is really slow unless you can somehow memorize the exact points at which you are supposed to turn into what element, but I just can't think that way. The game is remenisent of Super Meat boy as it always needs exact combos done at exact times in order to complete the level. And, just in my opinion, if you feel like you need to keep your player on a rail and get them to complete the game in the same way everyone will end up completing it, then maybe you should rethink the game design, as I do believe it is currently unplayable. I would not reccomend this game, but I would definitely reccomend the soundtrack. I know they can't change their design choices as the game is already complete, but at least I can stop some people from wasting their money, even with the Steam Sale.","December 20, 2013","false","0.5"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","7","15","0","0"

I thought very highly of this, thought it would be a glorious game with lots of fun. However, the music feels extremely electronic, it's good at times, but some pieces they use sound more like dubstep then anything else, to me. It's a good platformer, because it's actjually very hard. Something that makes it even harder, is that it sometimes just crashes in a weird way, instead of bouncing off the wall, or just hitting the enviroment, your "dude" just floats out of the "map" and keeps floating, the only way to restart is by restarting THE ENTIRE MAP. So if you say, tried a very long time to get past one obstacle, and this happens, well, let's say you get kind of ♥♥♥♥♥♥. If that gets fixed it's simply another platformer.

This game is all about moving forward.\n\nThe controls seem a bit more fluid with the hidden 'easy mode' enabled, but altogether the main difference from the 4 elements is that they move you in different directions. There's little actual puzzling related to fire/air/ice/rock and it's more about awkward ice sliding around slopes.\n\nOccasionally you have to melt your ice on lava to become water to fit through gaps, or use rock to break apart thin walls, or become a bubble to float up updrafts, but the emphasis is more on the game's akward physics.\n\nEven with easy mode enabled, prepare to suffer huge setbacks when you just happen to accidentally hit a slope going the other direction, forcing you to backtrack or die so you can restart with fresh velocity, often losing whatever velocity you might've had from the area beforehand.\n\nYou will find getting stopped by anything will render you useless. If you don't know what combos to use to traverse every next slope, which you won't on your first playthrough of course, you'll find your bubble bursting over and over.\n\nThe best thing this game has going for it are the superb graphics and audio.\n\nGameplay-wise, if you want to spend countless hours learning the maps to speedrun it or something, well, at least your videos will be enjoyable to me.\n\nImo at the very least, the easy mode should be considered the norm, and what is normal should become a challenge mode.\n\nMaybe I was doing something wrong but there were times I'd be respawned next to an area I have to get past, and because of that, it was nearly impossible to build up momentum to get by because I was supposed to already have momentum from an area earlier in the game.\n\nOr I was just completely clueless about how to get through with the limited recharging.","January 17","false","0.8"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

It takes some time to get used to the controls, but that's really the fun part of it. From the first level to the last, you have the exact same movement controls you just learn to master just that little bit better. Split second differences in key presses can result in very different movement results, but I never found it dull or repetitive. The least you can say is that it's original, but most would agree that it's both charming and challenging.\n\nSure, the game has you swearing at it on some occasions. the sort of "oooh, come on, make it make itmakeit!!!" moments. I sort of miss a quick restart from last checkpoint option, but everything else is spot on and has what it needs to have (wait...the help system is a bit tacked on. It's better than nothing, but not that much).\n\nI'd describe the mood and atmosphere, but the trailers do a good job of that. In a way, it reminds me a bit too much of nightsky, but that is not a bad thing. That too has a soothing atmosphere. And this one has some small dialogues to go with it that fit wonderfull.\n\nSince it's so unique, it's hard to point out similar games (aside nightsky). Yet I'd recommend it anyway.

It's a ton of fun and a real challenge! Everything about it is very well made. Soundtrack is INCREDIBLE. The game is literally worth paying $5-10 so you can get the soundtrack even if you hate every other aspect of the game (which you won't).\n\nSide bonus: There's little extras to go for and an online leaderboard :D\n\nThe only con to this game is that each chapter had me feeling like the game was building up to something and at the end it really never did. So, in the end, it really is a game without a story. And don't get me wrong, that's fine, it just felt like maybe the devs were toying around with the idea of unique story, so when it ended and there was nothing I was a bit saddened.\n\nSome people are complaining about the difficulty and saying it's a con? Difficulty is not a con. Difficulty is an interesting aspect to a game. The problem is when the game is unfair, which this one is not. The difficulty of this game makes it awesome. Otherwise, this game would be pointless.\n\n9.5/10","August 25, 2015","true","6.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

And by glorious I mean insufferable.\nSo this is what you get when a game takes away direct control, replaces it with physics puzzles, and then still asks you to be precise. It's fortunate that there's a helpful "you failed too much" guide since some of the puzzles are practically impossible to figure out otherwise. The physics don't feel like thye behave too consistently and they're very touchy to begin with. The end result is a frustrating mess without any sense of accomplishment as a victory feels like "oh, the game's physics worked right this time" more than "I did it, I am the best". The game looks nice and sounds nice, at least, but it's so inherently unfun that I can't recommend it to anyone.","October 26, 2014","false","4.9"," 7 of 18 people (39%) found this review helpful","39","7","18","0","0"

The atmosphere of the game immerses the player in a delicate world of being four elements: air, earth, fire and ice. Players really need to manipulate these elements in order to progress through the game. There are no levels or upgrades. It's all based on how well each element can be used together. Ice can slide, fire is invincible (to other fire), air is free and stone is heavy.

It is very tough to get back into the level then.\nAnother thing I really dislike about the concept is that it is really disappointing overall.

However, this game is a lot harder than it looks seriously, don't believe me?

Due to receiving a review copy, I was forced to play it. Cue shock. Not only was it wonderfully well thought-out - it was also difficult! Each obstacle is like its own little puzzle and sometimes progress can be slow, but when the solution clicks and you go flying through the level, there is no greater satisfaction.

Wiping out, mostly.\n\nOn that note, Element4al is not good for relaxing - disregard the pleasant music and Captain Planet themes.

Its easy enough to get through a level, the question is, can you get through a level without dying, catch all the "sparks" and hit the finish line in a short enough time to get a gold medal?

After you die a few times in one place, I think the number may be as little as three, no matter what level you are on it will start prompting you to ask it for help so it can teach you how to do what it wants you to with a little ghost element for you to follow. This can feel particularly like its just mocking you if you are already doing what it suggests and just havn't quite got the right angle yet and are over shooting or under shooting or not gathering enough momentum.\n\nThe levels are quite long for a platformer of this speed, and the save system unhelpful as if you leave and come back you will have entirely forgotten where you are going or how to get there. This is not something to play for a few minutes at a time.\n\nGoing to be honest, the level design art is lovely. The cutscene art creeps me out a little bit. It might creep others out as well.

It seems simple enough at first; transform into verious forms with different properties to navigate the terrain and reach the end of the level. All movement is done using your form's properties and the terrain, such as falling into a half pipe as a rock, turning to ice to slide up the other side, then turning to a bubble to get extra height.\n\nUnfortunately, the puzzles the game presents you require extremely precise timing of tranformation, and failing to execute a maneuver can often force you to respawn at the last checkpoint, which the game records as a death. And the game will inform you how many times yhou died on a level, as well as how many hidden collectibles you found and you much time you took. Apparently this is supposed to be a speedrunner game?\n\nAnd say precision speedrunning is your bag. The game's artstyle and writing convey the exact opposite. Your character has the personality of a curious child, and the art, while pretty, is very soft and peaceful.

This can feel particularly like its just mocking you if you are already doing what it suggests and just havn't quite got the right angle yet and are over shooting or under shooting or not gathering enough momentum.\n\nThe levels are quite long for a platformer of this speed, and the save system unhelpful as if you leave and come back you will have entirely forgotten where you are going or how to get there. This is not something to play for a few minutes at a time.\n\nGoing to be honest, the level design art is lovely. The cutscene art creeps me out a little bit. It might creep others out as well. Giving cells cute baby faces might not have been the best idea.","June 9, 2015","true","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But it can be incredibly frustrating and difficult. Many of the re-spawn points throughout the levels put  you in spots where you don't have the necessary momentum to do the correct move and it is very difficult to get beyond that point.","May 29, 2015","false","14.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I've seen that a lot of people complain about difficulty, but it's not that hard. And if it sometimes requires precise fingers, it's just to keep you busy for whole main game. Which is, needless to say, quite short in my opinion... I spent just 8 hours till I completed it even with great amount of fails. When I say main game, I mean the 12 core story levels, because the game has "race mode" where you either want to make three laps in as good time as possible on special maps, or you're trying to finish the story levels with the shortest time taken. Art is charming and cute, music is great and beautiful. For 8€ it's probably overpriced a bit, but if it's on any sale, take it.","January 28","true","9.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The controls are really simple: you use one of the arrow keys to transform into a specific element which gets you through a level. It's a cool idea, and for the most part, it plays out pretty well. Occasionally the movement frustrated me, but I think that was more of a lack of skill, rather than a game fault. I thought about it and I figured the game would be much simpler and possibly too easy if you were given more freedom with the movement. Possibilties could be endless though.\n\nThe soundtrack is really good, and it creates a really relaxing atmosphere, even if you are stuck at some point in a level. I found I was never frustrated when I had to repeat an area over and over. It's a cute game too, with little quirky written dialogue that kept a smile on my face while playing. The achievements were also fun to get and add replayability. (100% in just under 10 hours.)\n\nThere's definitely some downsides though. While I understand this isn't supposed to be a story heavy game, I wish they put more effort into it; I feel like there are so many cool concepts of life and death that could have been applied. Instead you get these little cutscenes featuring some weird ghost creatures that have creepy eyes. I still don't really get what the point in them was. And towards the end, for some reason i was getting a lot of FPS drops, even though my Macbook surpasses the requirements by a mile. Also, I really wish it supported Retina resolutions on OS X, it would have made this game so much prettier.\n\nI'd give it a final score of 6.8/10. It's a very decent game, but if you're patient, then grab it on a sale. The developer is very nice too. Active on the forum and gives help when people need it.","May 14","true","9.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
