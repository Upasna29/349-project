I mean that viral short Flash game that was all about the one unexpected jumpscare in third level, that made many viral videos about people getting mad about it. Well, The Growth Journey is practically the same, minus the jumpscare, plus more levels and specific win conditions.\n\nThe controls are really primitive - you click the right button and the circle follows your mouse cursor. Your target is getting as fast as you can, with the biggest circle possible, to the finish; while your circle mustn't touch any edge. There are two specific zones - the blue one, that makes your circle bigger, and the green one, that requires a specific size of the circle to let you pass through.\n\nThat's all! Now it's your time to get into the 50 levels of frustrating challenge that will test your patience. I mean, it will test your patience in case you won't get bored after first few minutes, which is highly possible.\n\nThe graphic design is really poor but let's say that the developers had intended minimalistic cheap style that looks up amateurish in the end, if I forget the only one nice effect of floating squares in the background. As I've already mentioned that you'll require patience, there's one more thing to strengthen this opinion - the soundtrack. And by the "soundtrack" I mean that literally - there's only one tune and it gets annoying fast.\n\nConclusion:Overall this looks more like a polished student's project for the final exam of "Programming II" (or something similar) and as it's even not entertaining at all, I doubt I would recommend it to anybody even if it was for free. And for 5,99 €? Don't spend your money here, there's SO MANY better games on Steam that this would be a mistake. I feel like it's been a long time since I felt so negatively about a game. Even the previous Cleverweek games (Two Digits and Three Digits), that also got negative review by me, are still better and, at least somehow, entertaining.\n\n\nDisclaimer: My copy of  The Growth Journey was obtained for free - I won the game in a giveaway that might have been sponsored by the developer. This fact hasn't changed my opinion about the game (and the review) in any way.\n\nFor more reviews, join Samurai Vader's Point of View group and follow my curator page, I'm always happy to see feedback about my reviews.","January 26","false","3.7"," 21 of 24 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","21","24","0","1"

At the same time you are trying to grow your ball as large as possible for the most points\n+ The controls while very basic are actually pretty precise and you can always tell that each mistake is because you were not careful enough to navigate properly.\n\n- The background music is an annoying repetitive loop\n- The gameplay itself can be frusterating, it's sort of like trying to thread a needle\n- I felt the game was overly basic and did not do enough to reward the player and seems to lack any other features.\n\nIt's a good concept, but I felt like it was a bit too simplistic to warrant a recommendation\n","April 13","false","7.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Смысл игры в том, что бы дать "шару вырасти" до заданного размера и довести его до конца уровня, не цепляя стены.\nЧем вы больше - тем сложнее с ним управляться.\nИгра сделано добротно, багов и вылетов не заметил, а музыка не даёт сгореть после очередного фейла.\nЗа такую цену не грех иметь в библиотеке.","May 30","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
