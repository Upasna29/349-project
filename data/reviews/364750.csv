But they are stripped down versions so Visual Studio will not give Errors when using the Code.\n\nThe games included are still Playable but you will not get any of the perks the Games for sale here on Steam Give and there is no Access to any of the DLC's with this.\n\nNow what you get here is Non commercial Access to the Source code for all 3 Games, what does this Mean?\n\nWhat it means is you have the code that was used to write the Games to play with for your own personal use Only.\n\nThere's a Post in the Discussions section Asking what makes this a AAA Title?\n\nPeople really need to Understand the Dev is not Selling the Games here this is a Package for the Source Code, again Yes the games are included but they are not the Same as the ones already for sell on Steam\n\nI have every game available here on Steam by This Dev and I have bought allot of Bundles from there Dailyindiegames.com site.\n\nWhen I saw that they released the Code to the Hacker Evolution Games I just had to get it, like I said before I have all the Games Released by Exosyphen Studios and will be buying the up and Coming Hacker Evolution Immersion when it is Released.\n\nThe Owner and Dev of Exosyphen Studios has always answered all My Emails and has given me some great deals on Stuff and his support on his games and anything else he does is top notch.\n\nReally not much I can say this is a Must for anybody wanting to see how a Hacker Game is Made or really any Game.\n\nPeople saying its not worth the $50 really don't need to even look at this page if you don't think $50 is cheap for the code to 3 Games. Then this is not for you.\n\nI am new to C++ but not to programming I have been programming in other languages for the last 15+ years and never really got around to C++. Always wanted to but its got a harder learning curve then say Basic.\n\nBut now that I have this I will set down soon and learn as much as I can from it.\n\nNow the Pros and Cons\n\nPros\n\n- You get Access to the Source Code\n- Support form the Dev\n- You get to Learn how to Code a Game in C++\n\nCons\n\n- None\n\nRating 10/10\n\nFinal Notes for every one reading.\n\n- This is well worth the $50 the Dev is Asking\n\n- No you will not get Access to the Original Steam Game if you want them Support the Dev and Buy Them.\n\n- Should I buy this if all I want is the Game?  No this is for programmers only unless you want to learn C++ then DO NOT Buy\n\nRemember this package is not meant for the Regular Steam user it is for programmers who want to learn more on how the HE games where made.\n\nIf your a programmer then I recommend you buy this and support the Dev, if your not then just buy the Games on Steam and Support the Dev.","June 2, 2015","true","0.8"," 142 of 162 people (88%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","88","142","162","14","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BirdCute/recommended/364750/","BirdCute","BirdCute","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BirdCute/","1506 products in account","Hacker Evolution Source Code is a package of three Hacker Evolution games: the original one, Untold and Duality. All of those three also come with source code, written in C++.\nIf this review is too long for you, I suggest you to only read the first paragraph about the game's content and the final verdict at the end.\n\nWhat is happening in the game:Game: you have to crack servers, bounce, steal info, solve puzzles, "fight" other hackers and avoid getting traced. Hacker Evolution series consist of pretty standard hacking games like Uplink or soon-to-be-released Hacknet. As a big fan of this kind of games, I enjoyed HE as well.\nSource code: of course, if you wanted to play hacking games, you wouldn't buy this. The main feature about this pack is the source code. It is written in C++ and it can be opened with Visual Studio (as well as the Community Edition, if you don't want to pay for the full version). This pack is intented for programmers or maybe people who want to learn programming and (like me) prefer learning by looking at something that is already made and figuring out why stuff works the way it does.\n\nPros:    The whole idea of offering people source code is great. It is not common for developers to share the code with people, even if they're asking money for it. And I have to say that learning coding by seeing a proper and working example is really one of the best ways to do it.\nAnother good thing is that there are all 3 games with their codes included. That way, you can see how code progressed, changed and what features were added or improved.\nThe code is written cleary so you should have no problems reading it.\nThe whole package seems very small, it only takes 1 GB of your hard drive space.\nRegarding the games, they are all good and you should like them if you're into hacking games. They have really good music and overall feeling is great when you play them.\nThe code can be compiled for Windows, Linux and MacOS, however, games in this pack can only be played on Windows.\nCons:    While you get all three games in this pack, you do not get access to DLCs. What a shame.\nThose game are good, but you're gonna get bored if you bought this for the games. One = good, three = too many.\nThe final verdict:If you are a programmer or just somebody who wants to know how to code, I really recommend this to you. You can't get a chance to look at some game's cource code very often. It includes three games so you should be occupied for more than enough time with the code.\nIf you're in for the games, I only recommend you to buy this if you want to support the developer as you can get the games much cheaper and the DLCs aren't included.\n\nAlso, I sincerely apologize that this review is not as lenghty as my other reviews are, it is exceptionally harder to review a source code than a game. Thank you for understanding and I hope you liked my review.\n\nGreetings,\nBirdCute\n\nNote that my copy of this game was obtained for free for reviewing purposes. However, this did not affect the quality and objectivity of this review.\n---\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","August 10, 2015","true","5.5"," 76 of 99 people (77%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","77","76","99","8","4"
