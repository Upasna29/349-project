Many of them played a few minutes and denounced it immediately. I have gone from start to finish. The game can safely be said to be 'complete', as in the developers won't add anything significant to better the experience. So why is this game so bad?\n\nA few facts:\n- 5 weapons available, where only 2 (wooden machete and M9 pistol) are actually used for most of the game\n- Crafting boils down to merely creating bandages, you can complete the entire game without crafting anything else\n- Crafting is limited to 7 items (8 in survival mode)\n- There are a total of 4 kinds of enemies, that pose virtually no threat whatsoever, due to inferior AI coding\n- The entire game can be completed in less than 4 hours\n- Shooting inanimate objects causes them to bleed\n- The single voice actor delivers his badly written lines in such way that you would quickly consider turning it off\n- A great deal of the game takes place in a temple area (The Maze), this area is riddled with instant death traps that are springed upon you for the obvious reason to infuriate the player and slow progress further into the temple\n- Level design makes frequent back-tracking unavoidable - in the maze it means constantly having to avoid the same traps over and over again\n- All enemies respawn after loading a save\n- Survival aspect in single player is negligable, due to readily available resources in all areas of the game\n- Your biggest threat will be the rock throwing monkeys and instant death traps\n- Animation quality is very low, this will be apparent from the very start of the game\n- No quicksave, despite the fact that frequent saving is absolutely mandatory\n- Most of the game mechanics rely on QTE's - bandaging takes about 20 seconds to complete\n\nA note on the added survival mode:\nA rather small section of the singleplayer map is isolated for you to 'survive as long as you can' - this entails running around in the day gathering food and crafting materials, then using a shelter to sleep at night. Due to the extremely barebones crafting system and the fact that everything is so easily obtainable, this experience does nothing to redeem the game whatsoever. If this kind of survival experience is desired, titles such as The Forest does this better in every aspect.\n\nSo tl;dr  - if you're looking for a survival game, there are plenty of other superior titles available. This game hasn't been too harshly judged by others, it fails in every aspect of gameplay from start to finish. For the morbidly curious, this game is an exercise in self-torture - it's not conducive towards any lulz whatsoever.","February 15, 2015","false","6.3"," 1,278 of 1,304 people (98%) found this review helpful 128 people found this review funny","98","278","1","128","18"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MrJenssen/recommended/242800/","MrJenssen","MrJenssen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MrJenssen/","520 products in account","Oh dear, poor Garry has gotten himself into quite a sticky situation! First, Garry the humble bush pilot had a bit of a mishap during a not-so routine transport job due to Yellowstone’s Mount Saint Helena erupting right as he passed over it, resulting in a crash landing in the middle of...The Amazon jungle? If that wasn’t bad enough, Garry now needs to endure countless lethal cannibalistic natives chasing after him all over the place, puzzles that’ll test your patience and game-breaking bugs that are as hilarious as they are frustrating. Let’s take a look at Garry’s Incident.\n\nSo, here we have Day One: Garry’s Incident, Wild Games Studio’s brand new, first person, action-adventure survival game. You play as Garry, a pilot who just crashed into the jungle and soon realizes that, along with the aggressive and possibly very hungry natives, rock-flinging monkeys and badly animated panthers that will devour your heart without a second’s hesitation, there is also something else going on in this place. Something very strange. Something...alien.\n\nThat’s basically the whole story summed up. Now that we have that out of the way, let’s look at the gameplay, shall we? So, Day One is, if anything, ambitious. It combines a lot of different gameplay mechanics in an attempt to stand out from the crowd. Though the description of the game might have you believe that this is some sort of open-world, free-roaming survival simulator like Minecraft or Don’t Starve, Day One is much more linear than that. You still have some freedom to move about the lush jungle environments as you scavenge for supplies and resources to stay alive, but this is definitely no sandbox game.\n\nSpeaking of Minecraft, there are some comparisons to be made between it and Day One. In a somewhat similar fashion to Minecraft, you have a hunger meter that gradually depletes over time unless you find food via hunting, fishing or plucking fruit from bushes. Day One also has a similar crafting system, where you combine items you find and click a button to convert into new tools and other useful things. Though you can experiment with the system to craft items, you’ll also discover pieces of recipes as you explore the world. You’ll need to memorize these, because the game doesn’t log the recipe for you before you successfully craft an item on your own.\n\nThe crafting itself is simplistic and the inventory menu is sub-par, making the crafting more tedious than it has to be. Click the crafting tab, then click the items you wish to use in the crafting process, hit “craft” and you might make something. Every time you craft something you need to go through the exact same quicktime event, over and over again. In fact, QTEs are very commonplace throughout the game and you’ll get annoyed by them faster than you would watching Daniel Tosh do stand-up “comedy”.\n\nAnother issue with the crafting, that is also something that goes far deeper than that, is the fact that this and the hunger system are completely arbitrary. You will never really need to catch much food. In fact, you can stay alive on the random fruits you find around the world alone. This is in part due to the fact that the game only has a couple of hours’ worth of gameplay before you complete it. In other words, risking your life hunting panthers or combining dozens of random items in an attempt to make a fishing rod is absolutely pointless. You’ll never need to worry about finding water sources to drink from or refill your bottle for longer treks either. Just click C - the default “drink water at water source” button - and you can drink water directly. Anywhere. Yes, even if there is no water around.\n\nNow, the aforementioned is obviously a bug and not intentional. Bugs are something Day One has a lot of. A LOT. I’ll give the developers some credit: they’ve released about five hundred million patches by now, improving upon the abysmal performance issues players had at launch and many of the worst game-breaking bugs. But even with most of the worst bugs now fixed - hell, BECAUSE many of the bugs are now fixed - it’s just so obvious that the game sorely lacks quality gameplay.\n\nI mean, where do I even begin? Okay, let’s look past the bugs for a second. I’ve already mentioned how the crafting system is pointless. Beyond that, the game’s mandatory puzzles are incredibly tedious and often demand that you backtrack and search every single crevasse in the large environments to find that one thing that’ll let you continue.\n\nAt one point, you’ll find yourself trapped inside an enormous maze of underground tunnels, where you need to pull switches in order to align some statues that opens up a gate, allowing you to escape. This simple task is arbitrarily stretched out and made incredibly frustrating by the fact that the switches are scattered around the maze far from one another, and finding them all is a pain because you only have a crude map painted on the rock walls to guide you. There are plenty of dead ends too. Sure, the various traps you’ll encounter are cool and somewhat challenging to master, but walking around for hours looking for switches gets tedious fast. This is not engaging puzzle-solving, people! It’s clearly just a cheap attempt to artificially pad out the game. In fact, the entire game suffers from this problem; you can spend a dozen hours completing this game that only has about three hours of actual gameplay and believe me, that’s not meant as a compliment here.\n\nThe extensive list of mind-boggling design choices continues. The game employs a crude stealth system that allows you to sneak up on enemies and kill them in a single hit. However this system is also made pointless because you’ll find so much ammo for your two pistols that you can easily kill every enemy in the game without worrying about ever running out. What is the point of spending three minutes sneaking up on some native - or engaging in close combat with him that exposes the atrocious melee system with broken hit-registration and laughable animations - when you can just shoot him in the head and move on without risking your life? For a survival game, surviving isn’t all that hard. Well, for Garry, anyway. For you, as the player, it can be a tough test to endure the torment of this game.\n\nAt least the game looks kind of okay. The graphics aren’t high-end or anything, but the jungles have a lot of foliage, making them feel lush and alive. It’s quite ambitious for such a small game. Animations, however, are not good. The world design is confusing and repetitive. You’ll also get stuck on objects or invisible walls all the time and you can clip through objects and even the ground. The sound design wobbles between mediocre and horrendous. Aiming your weapon feels sluggish. The inventory menu feels like it’s a pre-alpha placeholder. The QTEs are never-ending and...the list just goes on and on. Let’s cut it off here, shall we?\n\nI can sympathise with Garry Friedman. He’s in a pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥ situation. As was I, when I played this game. No matter how hard I tried to look for redeeming factors, I just couldn’t find any. When I finally reached the abrupt ending, I was disappointed that the game just wrapped up before it ever made use of any of its interesting mechanics and before it went anywhere with the story. But, at the same time, I was also happy that I was finally out of that hell. It’s obvious that the developers had a lot of ambitious ideas, but sadly the few mechanics that work are rendered pointless by the level design and the game-breaking bugs. Despite some glints of ambition here and there, even when ignoring the bugs, there isn’t anything here to warrant purchasing Day One: Garry’s Incident.","November 21, 2013","false","5.9"," 1,919 of 1,993 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","919","1","0","23"

Keep in mind, I have bought Shaq Fu, Duke Nukem Forever, and even though I  don't like Call of Duty I still bought them to try them out. BUT THIS! This is by far the worst game I've played. I understand that it's being worked on, but more work should have been done before being put up for purchase. The combat is broken, I have no clue what I'm doing or where I'm going, the puzzles that I do find are too easy. You can take damage if you fall from a height slightly higher than your jump. Your gun...is not a gun. Guns kill people when you shoot them and the bullet hits the person. Here, it just mildly annoys them. But you! Oh you die really easily. You can take damage even if your hurting the enemy. You'll see them react to getting hit, they look like they can't attack you, but you still get hurt somehow!\n\nThe game is unplayable as it is. You get attack often giving you no time to heal and figure out what to do. Some could say this adds a chalenge, but I say if that is the case then it's an unfair one. I'm just glad that it has steam cards so I can get some of my money back.\n\nSomewhere under all of the bugs, glitches and poor design choices, there is a good game. A game that can live up to the description the game gives you (the reason I bought this game thinking it might be good) but right now, unless the develepor can get some help, this game is not going to go anywhere.","November 26, 2013","false","2.6"," 1,292 of 1,352 people (96%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","96","292","1","2","7"

It's the equivalence of if all the animals in the world took the biggest sh*t in their life and piled them on top of each other, oh and all of them had the diarrhea. Let's have a look at the strikes against this game shall we?\n\nFirst off, the graphics in the game look like a late ps2 game and considering this is a game that was released when GTA V was released that's unacceptable.\n\nSecond, no matter how good your computer is and no matter how low the graphics are set to in the game, ur computer will have alot of trouble running this "game"\n\nThird, most of the sound for the game is missing, for instance at the beginning of the game u need to escape a temple and all of it is falling apart and when some of it hits the ground there was no f*cking sounds! Tht is basic game design add the sounds in! Even old atari 2600 games had sound!\n\nAnother thing tht I noticed with the falling parts of the temple, despite the temple being made of stone all the parts that fell off were wood. How cheap were thes guys they couldn't copy and paste stone off of the walls and onto the ground so they had to do with wood?\n\n\nAnd all of that is in the beginning of the game! I have more complaints when u get out of the temple.\n\nThe one thing u notice is that there are tons of trees around u and tons of nature. Just a shame u can walk though the whole thing! I'm not kidding you can literally walk through the trees. Apparently the game must have been a huge fan of another game "BIG RIGS: OVER THE ROAD RACING". The creator must have loved that game so much tht he wanted to turn it into a first person, survival game called "Day one: Garry's Incident"\n\nAnyway a person takes ur flask u chase her to a camp and she wants panther meat in exchange for the flask. I find the panther and then he jumps on me and this panther looks really realistic (Sarcasm). It looks like he was made by a 5 year old out of clay. Then I take the meat back, get my flask then........ nothing. It gives me anther objective to find the plane that I crashed in but I've looked all over the jungle for a solid 3 hours and I can't find it.\n\nI found other quests such as search temples and solve puzzles that the dumbest man on earth would call "child's play" A quest where u need to rescue a tribe leader and u get a piece of meat....... WOW A PIECE OF F*CKING MEAT! NOT A GUN! NOT AMMO! NOT BANDAGES BUT NO U GET F*CKING MEAT! I can't see why the other tribes leader wants to take over her village  if the best she can offer for someone saving her life is giving them a piece of meat.\n\nUPDATE: I eventually found the plane next to one of the villages. Garry drops his alcohol in one of the crates and it explodes... expect it to have a hangover.Then I get a bad cutscene that looks like it was made in microsoft publisher used in a slide show. It then tells u to escape the jungle. WHAT! WHAT WAS THE WHOLE POINT OF FINDING THE PLANE THEN IF ITS STUCK IN A TREE. HE KNEW IT WAS STUCK IN A TREE AT THE BEGINNING. WHAT DID HE THINK HE COULD SALVAGE IT! YEAH GO GARRY TRY AND PUSH THAT PLANE TO CIVILIZATION!\n\nThe next part involves u trying to find a gate to leave the jungle... wow. A gate. TRIBESPEOPLE ARE FORCED TO USE STRAW AND STONE (no wait no no no sry straw and wood yeah thts right) TO MAKE THEIR HOUSES AND HERE IS A FULL METALIC GATE! WHERE DID THEY GET THE MATERIAL TO MAKE THAT THING! and this is the part where I hit a dead end. The objective says open the gate. Sounds simple. But I tried everything and nothing works. Not sure wht im meant to do\n\nUPDATE: Turns out I needed to use the artifact I found in the temples on a srange statue next to the gate. The gate opens and then the gate opens and I end up falling through the floor. I end up in an underground lair used by the unknown created by whoever made it. This is a big place for 1 simple objective... open a door...... there's no puzzle nothing uneed to do except pull a chain top open the door. THT IS JUST A HUGE WASTE OF SPACE ON MY MEMORY FOR MY COMPUTER NO WAIT! LET ME REFRASE THT.. THIS WHOLE GAME IS A WASTE ON MY COMPUTER'S MEMORY.\n\nAnother thing, u won't believe this, but someone at the development team must have been thinking "hmmm I like crafting... and I like QTEs (Quick time events) HA! I knw Let's fuse things together" That's right the cafting involves u needing to o a Quick time event. Ican't make that up. If u want to craft a bandage u need to press "W" in time to rip the cloth. To put on the bandage u need to tap "W" press "D" to get the cap off ur flask then tap "W" to clench ur hand at he right moment and then hold "S" to wrap a long bandage around urself. WHT WERE  THEY THINKKING!\n\nAnother thing tht I have to talk about are the monkeys....They attack u. Yeah! monkeys hit u with rocks! plus the monkeys are completely bugged and are one of the most glitched things in the game. Once a monkey was facing the wrong direction to hit me with rocks and while he was still facing the wrong direction he still hit me. Also 3 times this next one has happened the monkey sometimes gets stuck in the huts of the villages.\n\nWhile we're on the topic of glitches this game is one of the most buggiest messes I've seen. I died once and then I repeatedly spawned under the map and died again which forced me to restart the game. The panther bodies have disappeared for me several times when I want to skin them. Every time I try to climb up a temple I seem to get stuck on one of the stairs. In a few cases my game even crahsed when trying to bring up the inventory. The list goes on and on\n\nEven worse the deveelopers of the game have the nerve of trying to convince people tht the game is good! They took down a youtube video game reviewer's review of day one garry's incident for criticising the game and the youtuber's name is TotalBiscuit. They claimed to be doing it on copyright claims for use of GAMEPLAY OF Garry's incident! Other videos with gameplay stayed on but totalbiscuits was removed as his was the most viewed and he eventually made them put it back  on youtube. Another thing they did was that they payed a few people to put up positive reviews of the game on metacritic.\n\nAnother thing  that shocks me is that they released a DLC For the game called "Survival". U HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME! U RELEASE A DLC FOR AN UNSTABLE GAME! U SHOULD HVE AT LEAST PATCHED UR GAME FIRST BEFORE PUTTING IN DLC!\n\nWhile we're on the topic of the DLC I'll tell u about it. It's basically u r trapped in te jungle but there is no story u just need to survive as many days in game as u can but it commits the biggest crime in a survival game THE DLC IS BORING! There are hardly any enemies in survival when u strt there r quite a few monkies and that is the hardest moment in all of survival the beginning. It's incredibly easy to survive aswell. There r tons of items surrounding the area, since there are hardly any enemies in the DLC there is hardly any threat! the only thing u will struggle to find is bamboo but objects regenerates.\n\nThis game has to be one of the worst, unstable games I've found.\n\nPros:\n\n+An interesting concept\n+An OK plot\n\nCons:\n-Bad grphics for 2013\n-Bad crafting interface\n-Terrible performance on any PCs\n-Glitched and bad A.I\n-Dialogue sometimes repeats itself\n-Some quests are glitched\n-They release a DLC for the game before patching it as if saying "This is the best it's gonna get"\n-An unforgiving price of £2.49\n-U can make a list of all of the stuff u can walk through\n-Quest objectives are sometimes unspecific\n-Extra missions are deleted from ur journal once u leave the area\nVerdict: 0/10\n\nUpdate 04/02/2016: for more on this game check out my gamefaqs review here: http://www.gamefaqs.com/pc/679098-day-one-garrys-incident/reviews/161858\n\nSteam curator group: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/MellowReviews","July 24, 2015","false","23.7"," 757 of 866 people (87%) found this review helpful 346 people found this review funny","87","757","866","346","43"

I got it on sale before it came out ($15 instead of $20) and I still feel like I overpaid/was ripped off.

Everything.\n\nPros\n1. Protagonist has a beard. I like love beards.\n\nLong version:\n\nAlright, so as you've seen from the reviews, this game is ♥♥♥♥ing terrible. I honestly bought this game because I thought I could find genuine interest for it, but I was so wrong. Even for $0.99, this game isn't worth it. This game literally is competing for bottom place with Bad Rats- it's THAT bad. Allow me to go into further detail-\n\nMusic- There is little to none throughout this game. I started the game and noticed it from the get-go. There is a GIANT lack of music and it really ruins the mood for the game and ruins the playthrough for me because it's not nearly as dramatic as they wanted it to be. For instance, you'll start the game and soon after the temple you are in will start to collapse, but instead of crumbling noises from debris, it's just dead silence as you only hear you own footsteps. It's so lack luster and I think the game would be more enjoyable with more music in it.\n\nFrame rates- This game is just horrible with it. Max settings on a GTX 950 doesn't even manage to get 60 FPS when I'm outside that temple....thing....whatever it is.... It's just so horrible. Low settings still struggles to keep a steady framerate, especially when outside and combat is involved. Combat is also clunky as hell, but so are the frame rates. Heh. This game is just so unoptimized, like, it's not even funny. There have been several updates claiming to have "optimized" the game, but those patch notes are lies. These developers lied to my face by saying they optimized their ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game for my sexy hardware. Bottom line, the framerates are bad/borderline unbearable even if you have a gaming computer.\n\nAnimations- Holy ♥♥♥♥, the animations are HORRIBLE in this game. Animations really don't flow at all, for example, at the start of the game you're introduced to our character (actually, you aren't, he's just shown sitting in his chair with no introduction whatsoever) and he appears to be pulling a "Max Payne" and has drugs, beer, pills, etc around his desk. He then proceeds to pick up his beer bottle and he (I think) starts to bring it to his mouth, but ultimately fails and tips the bottle upside down (without spilling ANY beer) and putting it to his chin. No drinking sound effects or anything, he just sets the bottle down and the game transitions into the next place- which is what I'm going to talk about next.\n\nTransitions- my literal reaction to various transitions: "Wait, what?"   "Ummmmm, how does that even work?"  They're so out of place and don't work at all with the story line. Going back to that whole "Beer bottle that he drinks from his chin" part in the introduction, the transition to the next scene is absolutely hilarious. So, he's drinking (?) his bottle from his chin and he gets some sort of transmission from his radio and it mentions something about his warehouse. Soon after, the camera zooms into the window and then severely cuts to a random shot of our protagonist in a plane to which a volcano explodes- sending him hurdling towards the ground with a blown engine. Soon after the volcano explodes and he's hurdling towards the ground, a box in the back of the plane starts to glow a blue glow and it makes a portal to which Garry (the protagonist) goes through forcefully. This begins the storyline, where he wakes up in the middle of a forest; being dragged by some tribal natives to some place. He faints and wakes up again in a temple; hearing a native with a sword sing some ritual and plans on stabbing him for some sacrifice or something. THAT'S ALL I'M GOING TO GET INTO, BECAUSE THIS STORY MAKES NO ♥♥♥♥ING SENCE AT ALL. So as you can see, the transitions make 0 (zero) sence.\n\nConclusion- If you thought about buying this game- don't, please, save you money. Even if it's for $0.99, don't buy it. These developers don't need to be supported and get more money to make another ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game for us. Even if you're going to buy it "for the lulz" please, just please, help some starving kid in Africa instead.

I mean you would think a game released in late 2013 would look good. Especially when games like Skyrim were out in 2011 for christ sake! But no! This piece of crap decided to use horrible graphics!\n\nThen theres the story. It sucks! Basically you are a guy called Gary (No ♥♥♥♥!) and your plane crashes leaving you in a 'Mysterious' forest and you have to survive. And thats basically it as far as story goes, except for some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t about a dead familiy.\n\nThen of course theres the actual gameplay, you know seeing as this is supposed to be a game, basically its just your average survival game. Theres a crafting system (which sucks) , it lets you make stuff like medicine and bandages. You can find food to eat and drink water. You can interact wit locals by either killing them, trying to ignore them or do the occasional quest for them. Theres also weapons you can find. At the start you get a wooded stick, which for some strange reason is incredibly effective, later on you find an old timey double barreled pistol in a temple(WTF is it in a temple for?) and even later on you get a regular pistol, aside from that i dont know as i hated this game so much that i stopped playing it after that.  The ony other weapon i encountered was a magical one shot energy cannon that is permanently strapped to your wrist. Although its meant for destroying walls it can be used as a weapon. I personally loved the idea of this weapon but what i hated about it is that it only carries one shot and you practically never get to recharge it( which is done at altar thingies).The guns you get are ridicoulsly under-powered and pretty much useless, where as your stick is very effecttive. It can kill enemies pretty quickly and if you sneak up behind people you can do a pretty cool execution-style stealth attack which is one hit kill. What i hated were the enemies that i encountered. The most common enemies are natives and i kid you not, MONKIES!!!!! The navives are easy to kill as long as you use the afforementioned stealth attack but otherwise they are really hard to beat. The monkies are actually suprisingly difficult to kill considering what they are. They basically hide and throw rocks at you and if you don't find them they will kill you quite quickly, if you do find them they just run away and start throwing stones again. This brings me to another point, the natives will sometimes just ignore you but other times will completely randomly go ape-♥♥♥♥ and attack you. What i found most annoying about this is that if a monkey attacks you and you attack it it will sometimes run to a native who will then come and attack you, so you have to deal with two enemies at once!\n\nOverall i personally really hated this game and would not recommend it to anyone. This game tried hard to be fun but in the end it failed and just ended up a bad far cry clone.","November 10, 2014","false","2.5"," 146 of 166 people (88%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","88","146","166","15","2"

It was a pile of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ kebab forged from the very depths of the sewers. This game also stamps on those who try to talk ♥♥♥♥ about it hence my clever review disguise, you see?\n\nI loaded up the game to be immediately greeted by a menu system that could only have been imagined by a man who'd have his testicles mounted on his wall, peering at them and polishing them at the weekends. I also noticed that this game also doesn't even have its own icon as it was still displaying the UDK icon for the game.\nOk, let's crank up the graphics. This game still uses the default variable names in menus - bAllowHighTextureMaterials...REALLY\n\nI then started the game to find myself in a sacrificial chamber with the world's most oblivious temple priest of all time. I escaped from ropes that weren't even tied to anything to begin fighting him with a machete which I must of pulled out of my ♥♥♥♥. I killed him and there was no death animation, he just fell over dead and vanished into thin air.\n\nI then started cutting down some lights and pushing buttons with my incredible arms that allow me to push buttons from a distance of 2 metres. Then for no explicable reason, the temple starts to crumble with broken rock meshes. I ran out of there and entered a cutscene which contained no sound at all.\n\nI followed a girl to a village and had to do a stupid fetch quest for animal meat. I went down the dirt path and saw a panther which activated possibly one of the worst QTE's I have ever come across in my entire life. I killed it and stole his meat. I brought the meat back and then stopped giving two ♥♥♥♥♥ about the missions.\n\nI continued the way I went before when I came across a pyramid. I climbed and there were many mirrors obviously placed for some kind of puzzle. I couldn't be asked and went back down the stairs again. Or atleast I would have if I hadn't died from fall damage by walking down the stairs. This showed me the death camera which would look like what I imagine a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ fly's vision to be like. It was here I couldn't stand it any longer and quit.\n\nBuy this game when it is super-cheap. I am 100% serious, you have to see this ♥♥♥♥!

Also the game was so ♥♥♥♥ing buggy that i would glitch out when i was in any kind of building. i could be point blank with an ai and not hit them with the sword. I thought this would all be fixed because well it was a new game at the time and normally they release big patches and stuff gets fixed. INSTEAD the devs were like f*** it lets release patches that mess up the game even more. About 3 patches later my game completly stopped working  like the game would crash on launch it would crash when i hit play. it wasnt fun and then the best part was that it deleted my save file. ALL hours i spent playing this game were wasted i lost that time in my life and it wasnt even good time spent. Great games such as any of the ARMA games rock and i dont mind playing it whatso ever. now there is ONE good thing about this game. the whole story of the game (the concept of gary flying his plane into a deserted island was cool) this game was more like a massivly suckier single player version of the tv series Lost. all in all this game should be pulled off of steam and please never buy this game. you will regret it.","October 11, 2014","false","3.9"," 116 of 142 people (82%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","82","116","142","16","0"

I have little to offer that probably hasn't been mentioned already, but I'd like to point out that I purchased this game for the sole purpose of experiencing the pure comedy on show, and I have to say it didn't disappoint me in that respect. So, what's on the menu with this comedy of errors then? Well, floating half-naked tribesman/woman, monkeys that appear to be on acid running aimlessly round and round in circles, cut-scenes that look 15 years old, voice acting that sounds like it was recorded by the most boring man on earth and combat so poor you'll actually laugh when you kill something. (trust me you will). One minute you're alive the next minute you're dead and often with no explantion at all as to why.\n\nEven if this game wasn't bug infested, it would still be fit only to cheer you up after a bad day at the office, because it will make you laugh at least, sadly for all the wrong reasons. So, why not buy this wonderful comedy and revel in its awfulness?\n\n\n\nOn second thoughts... Don't, just don't.

The game is not only bad, but the Developers try to silence anyone who tries to warn others. I've submitted several discussions on the official page, only to find them removed withing seconds.\n\nDO NOT BUY THIS GAME\n\nWhat in essence is a brilliant idea, with some really great features like a crafting system (even if it is exremely limited), that enables you to make some neat tools and equipment such as: a shelter to sleep in, a fishing rod, and a water pouch for when you're feeling parched. I was very interested in trying out this game the concept is great; the final product, not so much.\n\nUnfortunately it turned out to be one of the worst games I've ever played, the opening cutscene; the part that is meant to encapture the interest of the player is riddled with glitches. It begins with the protagonist blubbering like a baby to some guy who didn't know if he wanted to stand up or sit down, stand on the desk or stand IN the desk. I was willing to overlook the awful animation and unforgivable glithy-ness if the gameplay was at least half decent.\n\nBut unfortunatley the gameplay turned out to be so dull that it makes smashing your face into a wall seem like entertainment. Don't be fooled by the trailer, the combat is... how can I put this... glitchy, no that's not it... terrible? Nope, that's not it either. I suppose the only real way to describe it would be "S**T!".  The game begins with the player being dragged off to some temple to be sacrificed by some locals who are ♥♥♥♥♥♥ that your helicopter crash landed into their friends, killing EVERYONE involved (other that you of course), you are then thrown into the worst combat that I've ever seen in any game, ever. Enemies seem to be able to attack you even though they clearly have a bad case of advanced rigormortism, I thought that they were zombies at first but alas, no, it's just more awful animation.\n\nMy advice is to save your money and play something else. At least until the developers can admit their mistakes and put some effort into making this game playable.","December 2, 2013","false","3.7"," 56 of 59 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","56","59","0","2"

Everything about it feels low effort, this is substandard for what a hobbyist UE3 modder might come up with. The game is tiny. You can run the entire circumference of the game world in about 3 minutes. It's populated by 4 NPC types. You have angry red diaper tribesman, angry brown bra tribeswoman, angry poo flinging monkey, and angry black cat. The bandages are bugged, if you cancel them before they finish you are healed full anyway and they are not consumed, so the survival aspect is out the window. Your supplies are virtually unlimited. The weapons make absolutely no sense. Your 9mm autoloader and your cap and ball pistol both reload by gently rubbing them. The game is plagued by technical flaws. Nothing feels right, nothing looks right. It's hard to explain, but everything is WONKY. That is the only word for the combat and movement in this game. Performance is inconsistent at best. The game doesn't even support my native resolution of 1360x768 so I played it in a window. But above all else, the sound design is horrific. I just played with the whole game client muted. The game is better muted than with sound on, trust me. You will never hear anything worse in your life as long as you live than the sound design of Garry's Incident.","May 28, 2015","false","0.9"," 54 of 58 people (93%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","93","54","58","17","5"

It prevents people that don't deserve this amazing game from playing it.\nI especially like the way that the game developer gave this game to me for free and told me to give it a good review and tell my friends to buy it :) So that's what I'm doing!\nIf you are looking for a challenging game not for the actual challenge but the fact that the game handicaps the player, look no further! If you're looking for a game which is more dull than minesweeper, you've come to the right place!\nIt is great to force your friends to play! The storyline is really unrealistic too which adds a ton to the immersion.\n\nGraphics - 10/10 (Very nostalgic of 3D games from 1998)\nGameplay - 10/10 (Brilliantly challenging, may be almost impossible to play!!)\nStory - 10/10 (All the good parts of FarCry 3 removed to give you a nice nitty-gritty experience)\nMusic 4/10 (It sets the tone and style of the game and has a long and various soundtrack [Not for me!!] )\n\nOVERALL A 10/10 WORST GAME EVER!\n\nMUST BUY!\n\nEDIT: So the game is now in the weeklong deals. That's fab, more people can experience the melted rainbow of a game that is Day One: Garry's Incidence. I am... happy... that Steam are behind this game and even went so far as to use it as a main game on their homepage. Steam would be making a mistake if they weren't endorsing this! Oh wait, no, the developer just bribed Steam to do it. Wow, that shows that the developer has the money and is therefore a great developer! I'm just going to go send him some money on PayPal.\n\nOh and some advice to the dev: If you made physical copies of the game, then the game would be worth almost 20 times as much by the value of plastic in the case and ink in the instruction manual. Maybe Gamestop will sell it? Just a thought.","February 8, 2014","true","1.2"," 693 of 1,030 people (67%) found this review helpful 93 people found this review funny","67","693","1","93","41"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jesskitten/recommended/242800/","jesskitten","Shiara","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jesskitten/","1888 products in account","Yay, I get to review this now!\n\nFirstly, I am a huge indie games supporter, but check out http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfgoDDh4kE0 as to why these devs deserve all the smacks on their collective wrists they can get. Then check out their metacritic page (http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/day-one-garrys-incident) and laugh along at its awesomeness. 0.5/10 average user score after 1548 reviews.\n\nStill, it came in the recent Bundle Stars indie game bundle, and surely can't be that bad right? Maybe just a victim of internet hate? And it has Steam trading cards, so it's pretty much me being paid to play it, right? Ha. Haha.\n\nLet's see. The graphics are absolutely awful, simple, low-rez, stock graphics pasted together, primitive character models are pretty much just going through the motions with no facial expressions and really crude, robotic animations. Corpses despawn immediately upon death, though the background corpses that are there are violently graphic.\n\nWhat little voice acting there is is dreadful, and really is just made up of short snippets (that often doesn't make total sense in the context - like "Uh oh" when you fail a crafting combination, even though you don't lose anything for it) set to trigger when certain events happen. It takes several hits to bludgeon enemies to death and in the meantime they don't sound very perturbed by it.\n\nThe AI is deplorable, when you can shoot npcs from range and they often won't come for you as they slowly die, nor do any of their friends around them. You can even sneak right up behind an npc, shoot another one, and none of them will hear it. Even when charging right up to them, half the time they just stand there glitched and let you melee them to death.\n\nCrafting is senseless, and involves a boring little mini..game? No, not really, just a mini-animation-thing, with keys to press, that shows off exactly how poor and juvenile their animations are.\n\nThe plot makes no sense, the starting video is incoherent (though the guy's utter lack of facial expression or reaction or voice as his plane is crashing is awesome), and there is no plausible explanation why things happen the way they do, like why that plasma weapon was sitting where it was or how the guy knows it's going to float up to attach to his arm or why/how he can still change weapons after that. NPCs will appear out of and walk through solid objects at will, the uneven screen shake during the starting escape portion will give you nausea, and you will find dumb bugs like how boxes during that escape portion can fall on your head and trap you inside their model without the game registering a death and forcing you to load or anything.\n\nAnyway I'm out of negative adjectives, except to say that the game is a pile of snivelporking frumpletops. This smells like a novice-level game programming class project that even for that level came out really badly, yet somehow got developed further after.\n\nYet, you should get this game. Why? Because it makes every other game on your Steam list look better by association. In fact, maybe it belongs on my Game Collector showcase on my front profile page... hmm. But hey, don't feel too bad about it, devs, some game had to be the bottom of the barrel here at Steam. By submitting this game, you just ensured another game didn't have to be. Very charitable of you.","January 14, 2014","false","1.0"," 53 of 57 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","53","57","0","5"

One day, whilst out flying my light airplane, a, er...I think it was a volcanic eruption or something...causes my plane to crash in an apparently uncharted - though presumably close to home - jungle.  I wake up from unconsciousness to find myself being dragged by "savages"/cannibals/guys in fancy dress to an unknown destination.  I again fall unconscious and awaken once more to find myself tied down to a sacrificial altar, with some joker about to stab me in the heart with what I guess, given the circumstances, must qualify as a "sacrificial" knife.  Not tied down very WELL, fortunately, as I easily break my bonds, grab a weapon and enter into a brief but awkward (but swiftly victorious) "combat" with my would-be murderer.  There is a native girl nearby in chains...my character briefly ponders aloud in a Duke Nukem-esque voice whether he should save her - thereby perhaps further risking himself - or leave her to her fate.  I choose to split the difference, and murder her in cold blood with a swift slash of my knife.  Garry has no time for sentimentality, he has some serious drinking to get back to...but first, he must of course return to civilisation.\n\nI begin to search around the huge temple area, and find two fruit-like objects on the ground...I attempt to pick them up.  Wondering why I do not seem to be having any success, I suddenly realise that they have been inside a BARREL all this time - or did the barrel just come crashing from out of the thin air above to magically envelop them?  It certainly seemed that way.  No bother.  Garry will not be hampered by any mere barrel, so he smashes it to smithereens and "obtains" the mangos.  The Gods can do their best to hide mangoes from Garry, but Garry laughs at the Gods and their petty whims...if Garry wants mangoes, so Garry shall HAVE mangoes.  And so I continue searching about the grand sacrificial hall, and find only a pair of double doors which not only refuse to open, but indeed refuse to even be acknowledged in any noticeable way, shape or form.  Just decorative, then.  So be it.  There must, however, be a way out of this wretched place, with its high ceiling and burning braziers and cleaved-in-two bodies casually scattered across the floor like so much spilled milk in a share-house full of slackers.\n\nBut what is this curious writing upon the walls?  No, not writing...cave drawings...telling me I must cut some chains on some suspended braziers in order to get two eyes to light up on an Easter Island-style stone head.  Of course!  Why had I not thought of this before!!  Foolish, stupid Garry.  Two broken chains later, another Easter Island refugee slides aside and a way out is revealed.  Garry can practically TASTE the freedom in the air!  We press on...\n\nThere is another savage up ahead, with his back fortunately turned to me.  I am informed by the on-screen gaming Gods that I can perform a sneak attack by pressing "CTRL" and edging forward, then pressing "E" when I reach my quarry.  I accomplish this, effortlessly but bloodily, by apparently placing my knife to the front of his throat and pushing inward (no "slashing" or "slitting" required).  Who are these strange men, with throats as soft as butter?  I have not the time to ponder, as I must press on as always...\n\nA room, with three buttons with symbols on them.  There are large amounts of intricate "writing" on the walls about them.  A time-consuming puzzle, perhaps, for Garry to decipher?  No heed, I shall simply press the three buttons, left to right...SUCCESS!  No devious puzzle shall prove a hindrance to Garry.  And what is this?  A strange object has appeared on a nearby stone, near to where I have recently picked up a flintlock-style pistol.  It is a magical armband, which Garry - being no slouch, and having no need of trial nor error - is extremely quick to realise, so of course, he tries it on.  It glows with an ethereal energy!  A new weapon, it seems.  But no rest for the wicked, as the whole temple begins to crash down around Garry's feet!  But alas, I am too slow, and soon enough find myself trapped within a multitude of fallen stone blocks which, in spite of failing to kill me, have effectively trapped me to the point where I have no choice but to restart from the last save point.  Such is life.\n\nThe second time around, Garry manages to avoid being trapped or crushed by falling debris, and even manages to casually shoot a fleeing savage in the back as he, like Garry, can do little but helplessly run for dear life.  We emerge, at last, into the open air of the jungle!  Not home and hosed yet, Garry.  Indeed, it is only seconds later that, erm, SOMETHING occurs - there is some vague semblance of a scuffle, and now there seems to be a savage running away in front of us - ah!  The on-screen gaming Gods inform us that she has stolen Garry's all-important FLASK, and as Garry is quick to observe out aloud, he can get by without "the women" but he cannot survive without his regular alcohol intake.  The chase is on, then, to reclaim Garry's flask!  Fortunately, the savage leaves a highly visible trail of stardust we can follow, even when she runs out of our sight.  At some point she decides the game is up - Garry is clearly too much of a match for her - and she stops and turns, patiently awaiting the fate which must surely become all who dare come between Garry and his demon drink.  The dastardly pickpocket duly dies for her sins, without so much as a fight.  She knows what she has done is wrong.  This is what befalls all who do not embrace the moral purity of Capitalism and choose instead to run around in wildernesses wearing loincloths.  Bet she didn't even know what "AFK" means, the brutish savage.  No doubt she would be vote-kicked from a bout of Left 4 Dead 2 Versus within two flaps of a butterfly's wings.  But fear not, Garry is here now in the land of the savages, and he will cleanse them all with not only the might of his magical armband, but drive his point home with the boisterous cut, thrust and parry of a well-placed and witty one-liner.\n\nBut alas, it is here that we shall - for now, at least - end our tale of the wondrous adventures of Garry, lost in the land of the savages.  Is there more to come?  We shall have to wait and see if I could, in all honesty, be ♥♥♥♥ed.\n\nVerdict: 4/10 (6 out of 10 for sheer amusement value; 2 out of 10 for actual game quality...averaging out to 4.  See, Garry's pretty good at math, too...)","August 23, 2014","false","1.7"," 39 of 44 people (89%) found this review helpful 35 people found this review funny","89","39","44","35","3"

The crafting and survival system is about as in depth as farcry 3. The combat is terrible, guns don't sound anything like they should and melee is clumsy. Day one looks and plays like a game released 7 or 8 years ago. The story from the beginning cutscene is almost non existant, read the plot on the product page to have any idea what is going on. As for variety of enemies we have panthers, evil tribals and monkeys throwing rocks, avoiding spoilers there is on more type but nothing exciting. One problem that really needs to be adressed is tabbing back to steam and back in screws up the video in game had to restart every time.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/maluno1/recommended/242800/","maluno1","Maluno","http://steamcommunity.com/id/maluno1/","885 products in account","My thoughts go out to anyone who, for whatever reason, bought this thing at full price. After 1 hour playing Day One: Garry's Incident, I was overcome with a feeling of shame for ever giving any other game a bad review, because the reason for those just seem petty now in comparison.\n\nThe game starts with a cutscene drenched in screen tearing even though vsync was enabled. I then find myself (as Garry) strapped to a stone altar of sorts in the second cutscene after which I must perform an action (mashing a button) to free myself before an awfully animated shaman ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ sacrificially stabs me. During this whole scene there is absolutely no ingame sound, not even crickets. It's like they forgot to include the sound files related to that event in the game.\n\nAfter freeing myself and making that ♥♥♥♥♥♥ animation meet its demise, I find this scantily clad indigenous babe chained next to the altar and I'm faced with the choice of either freeing or killing her. Being a gentleman (one who sports a blade in case things go sour anyways) I decide to let her go, but I'm using a gamepad and the controls I'm being shown onscreen keep switching randomly between keyboard and gamepad directions, so I end up having to guess what to press only to hear her whimper as I kill her accidentally. Now she's dead, oh welp. I hit her again because... because yes, and she blurts out the same cry. And again, and again, and again. Outstanding. From now on it can only get better.\n\nNow I'm wandering around the temple until I find a piece of cloth and get instructions to craft it into bandages. I do that, and then I place two bandages in the crafting window to see if I could further combine them, and that's when our Garry says it out loud: "UH-OH!" and the game just crashes, with an UDK failure pop-up on Windows and all. That was actually funny because it seemed like he had suddenly become sentient (with a touch of clairvoyance) to our out-of-game reality, and I would naturally have considered a feature like that a pro, had I not found after relaunching the game that Garry says that every time you try to combine un-craftable things. Disappointment.\n\nVoice acting is not something I'm picky about, but here it is a thing to behold. I feel however I lack the vocabulary to describe something like that, and that it would be like trying to transcribe the humour in someone else's stand-up comedy act through written word. YouTube is just around the corner if you're curious.\n\nGiven the red wall of top rated negative reviews glaring at you from the front page of the game's store, where even the couple of positive reviews are either sarcastic or humorously and explicitly trying to not be flagged as 'innapropriate' by the dev (who seems to have tried to do that with no success), you'd have to be blind, stupid, masochistic or possess some real next-level avant-garde sense of irony to buy this game.\n\nBut if like me you got this in a bundle (with other games that you wanted) for nearly nothing, you might feel compelled to let its trading cards drop at some point. When you do that I'd humbly suggest playing the game while you wait for the drops rather than just idling, just so you can experience first-hand what will likely be the most ludicrous attempt at a game that you've ever played. If not for science, then for the sheer comedic value. And unless you're much more easily amused than I, the comedic value will last about as long as it takes for the cards to drop, at which point it will be the right time to quit and uninstall this garbage.\n\nNot that I'm trying to tell you how to live or anything.","June 1, 2014","false","1.1"," 19 of 20 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","19","20","0","3"

As bad as most of the game is, at least the models for everything are high-poly enough to look pretty decent. Granted this doesn't work for any of the animals as they look as flat and devoid of any fur detail as your average PS1 game.\n\nDisregarding the now infamous events surrounding the game, expectations should be tempered considering it is an independent game title from a studio you've never heard of. Even then, it disappoints.\n\nYou can do stealth kills on the amazon women... with the same death roar as the men you kill. You can kill every animal in the game with a single pistol bullet (even from the awful double barrel "old pistol") yet it takes 3 pistol rounds or 2 M9 rounds to kill a completely unarmored person. Nearly all interaction animations end up throwing the camera underground, zooming in the camera so much you can't see the animations, or having the model clip through the camera. Most crafting is trial and error as even when there are recipies oddly drawn on some rock, half the ingredients are "helpfully" displayed as scribbles. Granted all you ever need are bandages and the leather water jug anyway. Lighting is all sorts of wrong and broken... but then again it is an Unreal Engine 3 game.\n\nThere was a $50k kickstarter for this game, which failed, and I think that explains the game. The kickstarter failed, so the developer probably just gave up and put the unfinished beta into Greenlight. With the absolute zero quality control there of course it got accepted. I hear all but one guy left the company some time after release, which explains the tiny insignificant update made two years after release.\n\nAlso, optimization/performance is unacceptably poor. I may not have the toppest of the line rig, but an overclocked i5-3570k, GTX780 Lightning, and enough RAM to run a large server should not be struggling to keep above 30 while running Crysis 3 on Max hovers around 45-60 and keeps games with similar-yet-better graphical fidelity to this one like Dead Island and Far Cry 2 well above 100 FPS.","July 12, 2015","false","4.9"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","17","19","2","0"

I fired it up, interested in seeing if it was really as bad as . . . everyone -- literally every one . . . has ever said. After all, I tend to be a contrarian. Maybe it has some redeeming qualities.\n\nAfter playing for a bit, I can confirm that it does not. Everything about Gary's Incident feels like a very early iteration of a high school first time 3D UDK development project. If a young person came up to me and presented this to me as their creation, I would be highly impressed. Unfortunately, when I come to Steam, I expect professional-quality projects created by actual game developers -- even if independent.

I repeat, DO NOT buy this game! It will keep you captivated for hours on end and nothing else will be important to you any more - not your friends, not your family, not work, hell, not even eating or sleeping! The story line is thrilling - I mean, an alcoholic pilot transporting magical artifacts over the Yellowstone Caldera which happens to erupt with no warning and then being teleported to an Amazonian temple? GENIUS! Give the storywriter a medal! Oh, and the bugs are just to die for! Both of my saves are bugged so badly that they are unplayable, one where I am stuck underground and the other where I fall repeatedly through the world and die on spawn - and I'm only 5 minutes in! The bugs add an additional challenge that will entertain and excite all gamers, casual and hardcore alike! Oh, and the nostalgic graphics that take you back to the early 90's? Absolutely wonderful, it's almost as if the developers knew what we were craving for!! Meanwhile, the death animations are faultless - dropping with no elegance and disappearing almost immediately off the face of the Earth. Let's be honest, nobody wants to see a corpse lying around and nor do they need an over the top, dramatic ragdoll effect when you end a poor fools miserable life. You must be thinking 'I must buy this, what more could these Gods amongst men possibly provide us?'. Well, Don't get me started on the acting! Seriously, how these guys haven't cracked Hollywood is beyond me! The same monotonous tone is used throughout, whether it is making a comment whilst slaughtering a poor, innocent captive or stubbing your toe on the floor as you pass through it to an untimely, buggy doom. This familiarity is a necessity in the gaming world, allowing you to know exactly who you are still without breaking out of the captivating immersion!\n\nOh, and did I mention that the game also allows you time to reflect on it's own brilliance in the form of lag and over the top loading times, even with a £1000 well specced PC?

I stopped playing after coming down from the 'pyramid' and getting oneshotted by one of the natives. The game definitely needs more polish.\nThe jungle area seemed very confined, with lots of narrow paths surrounded by unpasable walls. I had flashbacks to the forest areas of Zeno Clash and the jungle area of Lands of Lore 2.\nThe saving system is problematic - it doesn't fully record the state of the world. On game load, enemies seem to respawn (even set pieces), destructible obstacles are back, and the action sequence screen shake isn't there anymore. The loading times drained my patience since I was getting killed every minute.","May 5","false","1.9"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","15","16","0","0"

Forget advancing through the story.  Forget survival challenges.  Hell, forget looking for amusing glitches.  Simply moving from point A to point B is an aggravating ordeal.\n\nI can deal with the abrupt instant kills, the gratuitous invisible walls, the overly simplistic stealth mechanics, and even those damned monkeys, but not when the framerate feels like my screen is grinding against my eyes.\n\nThe worst part is that this could have been bad in a funny way.  Like, for example, one time I tried to shoot an enemy from atop a pyramid, but not only did an invisible wall block my shot, the ricochet killed me!  I still didn't have my last trading card, so I spent the next few minutes killing myself against that invisible wall, just to pass the time.  Unfortunately, if this game is ever brought a playable state, most of the more entertaining problems will probably be fixed as well.  Too bad.\n\nAnyway, don't buy this.  If you get it in a bundle, don't install it.  This game is painful to play.  Leave it be.","February 13, 2014","false","1.2"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","16","18","0","0"

I kept making excuses for the stupid mechanics and having no idea why I was taking damage or why I could bump into a guard while sneaking up on them and they had no idea I had ran into them.  After all the frustration, I decided to come back to the store page to see if there were any updates listed or any dates on when it would come out of "Early Access" alpha or beta stage it was in.  Then I realized... this wasn't an early access game.  The developers actually think this is a finished production quality piece of work.  Wow.  That is sad.\n\nCollision detection doesn't work.  Damage seems to be broken.  Weapons are unbalanced.  The special weapons you see in the movie are basically one shot items for the most part because they have to be recharged and there is no recharger point.  The blue glowing magic rocks embedded in your arm weapon?  I got it... but I have no idea how to use it and it is not in the weapons list when I scroll through.  I saved the amazon queen only to have her stand up and immediately disappear which froze my screen.  I waited about 15 seconds and then I got control back and it told me that I had cooked some meat.  Uh... I was no where near a fire.\n\nThis game has flaws and its flaws seem to have flaws.  There is potential here but even if all the mechanics were fixed, I still wouldn't want to play it for the inane voice overs that this guy spews.  Its like they wanted to be funny like the original Duke Nukem games but have no idea what funny is.\n\nDo not buy this game.","January 3, 2014","false","1.6"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

The way you pull out the weapon randomly at the beginning was awseme. I went through and saw the monkeys which are awsemely textured with blue eyes and they through their phesus at you. The damage system is amazing also, when ever i go up to panthers and pet them and all they do is growl for no reason as I survive the incident. I really like it also how I see the UDK symbol because who needs a graphic designest. Was his name Garry and he accidently forgot to do the icon and that was his incident. I do like the loading screen with the magic box that has purple crap comming out of it. Its like ufhdsilddnsjlidsjilfnh uijdhs. And I really enjoy the textures that just spam crap your screen when you press alt and tab. It reminds me of the year 1982 when I played the best game of the year, E.T for the atari 2600, dude you talk about game of the year edition. It reminds me of that because all those copies were barried in a ditch and never seen again. Like this game, it should be barried because they are both great games of the year and were preserved in the ground because they were soooooo good that no one could ever witness the horror of the games! My friend also enjoyed this game, he said "lulz i luv it m8 i gve it 8/8", by the way my friend is lorenzo and has ALD and is deaf blind and can move his hands. So all in all, I love this game because the only way you can enjoy it is if you are on PTSD and having Heisenberg blue quality stuff and being mentally ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.     :) Excellent game 8/8\n\nP.S lulz you ar a wizard harry, watch as i mke dis coment dishaper bcause its honst.","July 15, 2014","false","3.6"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

It tries to have a crafting system, but then the crafting system doesn't really even do much at all. And the things it does do, there's no way to find out how to craft them unless you just pure trail and error it. The story is god awful (at the start of the game, you have to untie yourself after being captured by tribals, AND THE GUY JUST STANDS THERE AND WATCHES YOU GET OUT), the animations are even worse than the story.\n\nThe game also falls under the whole 'every game needs a gun' rule, apparently. Without even explaining it, you find an old flintlock pistol thing, and literally 2 minutes or less later you find a modern glock. I mean, what the hell is exactly happening in this game? And I just stopped playing after they make MONKEYS in the game the most dangerous thing. Don't buy, don't try.\n\nAlso, there's a reason why the game dropped from 20 bucks to 5. Cash grab. Only reason I have is becasue they tricked my friend into thinking it was good and they bought it for me as a suprise... made me feel bad when I said that it was the worst game ever.","March 23, 2015","false","1.5"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","82","9","11","3","0"

To many workarounds to get the game running, not even a decent pre-setup to do some finetuning on the game. All this reminds me of games made in the 90s when most setups weren't required since everybody either owned a CGA, EGA, VGA or SVGA card. And there were only Adlib and Soundblaster cards for sound.\n\nWell, at those times you got at least a game running even IF your Ram wasn't high enough, you could do finetuning with some kind of memory manager. In this game you are first greeted by... Locked Display error, after you solved this little trouble you get to know the slow flash mode of the game, alternating between black screen and desktop - with no normal way to interrupt the game but to restart the computer. After you have solved this problem, you see a screen and video with some glitches (No, I have two computers one with integrated graphics and the other with a high end graphics adapter - it's the same with both).\n\nSo recomendations? What for? For a game which might have been a good game if the programmer worked on a broader basis and didn't try to enforce their own narrow side of game design? For a game full of bugs, glitches and frustrating workarounds? Steam would do a good thing to remove their approval and remove the trading cards on this game. Supporting a narrow set of boards and configurations is always a bad thing.\n\nThis game would get zero points out of ten for bad conduct. Prospects and after release debugging aren't a good way to start, especially when the prospects don't come even close to the expectations one held for a game.","February 6, 2014","false","0.4"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Sometimes models will disappear from your hands, the crafting is all quick time events, for some odd reason the foliage sometimes grows in size and shrinks as you move closer.\nUDK showcases it's true beauty when you ALT+TAB and all the textures stretch to the moon and back, improving the gameplay quality ten-fold. The monkeys are all OP, the humanoid enemies deal a lot of damage but can just be easily outsmarted by moving slightly to the left or right and the panthers are quick time events with Garry yelling "IS THAT ALL YOU GOT?!"\n\nGod forbid you try out the wonderful Survival Mode which consists of one loading screen, a lovely 5 second shot of Garry plunging into some beige looking void along with a very manly scream which then results in death and being sent back to whatever last save you had over in the Story Mode.\n\nThere's no actual graphics options, just extras like V-Sync and Dynamic Shadows except for one box you can tick called Detail Mode which I suspect means "Do you want graphics?".\n\nI can't say I would or wouldn't recommend this game...it's an experience though I can tell you that.","May 28, 2014","true","2.4"," 24 of 41 people (59%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","59","24","41","6","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dalewoodington/recommended/242800/","dalewoodington","TourettesPanda","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dalewoodington/","527 products in account","I went into this game having forgotten everything about it when it was launched. It started off promising with no sound effects until the first guy was dead. After which, he vanished. I then found a captive lady who I promptly killed, and continued to make the same horrific death sound about 10 minutes afterwards. The instructions on the walls were very subtle, so much so I spent a long time in the first area because I was captivated, I mean lost.\n\nAfter I had managed to get out of the first room after the huge stone structure slid across the room like it was on ice, I managed to escape the temple. I then had my flask stolen, and was promptly instructed to follow the glittery path the thief left. When they stopped, I shot her. To which I was prompted with a static version of the model...and my flask back. Kill the entire village (all of which made feral sounds when they died). One shot a panther....to die from a monkey because it was funny as running around flinging what I can only assume was poo at me. Death by poo is not fun by the way.\n\nWhen trying to remember what about  this game seemed so familiar, I remembered that a few youtube commentors had reviewed it and got the book thrown at them because of it. I can't understand why, because they were telling the cold hard truth. This game feels and looks like it was built by a single todler. Half the menus get this weird yellow box around it which stops the rest of it from working, the controls feel like I have my hand up Garry's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and controlling him through his rectom. The combat is poor, the "special effects" look like they came from 2001...and this was built on the Unreal 3 engine. An engine which has been used many times to produce beautiful games. I didn't even think it was possible to ♥♥♥♥ up a game this badly since that DayZ rip off.....wait a minute.\n\nIn closing, this review is something you should read before buying, or playing this horrendous game. I bought this in a bundle of 6 or so other games for about $4AUD, and even then I feel ripped off. After writing this, I'm going to promptly take the hard-drive it is installed on and burn it, as there is no other way to remove that vast amount of ♥♥♥♥ off an electronic device.\n\nP.S. If the developer is reading this, don't censor this and remove it. I paid hard earned cents and I'm allowed to voice my opinion and facts on this game. I couldn't give a monkey's toss (hehehe) if you don't like it. I would rather save some poor kid his pocket money than have this game be sold.\n\nP.P.S I've had ♥♥♥♥♥ that have been more pleasent and larger replay value than this game..and I can't bring myself to finish this.","February 9, 2014","false","0.5"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

The game starts off with a nice intro sequence making you think that it was worth the money you spent on this, but when you get in game, the lack of effort put into this is phenomenal.\n\nPros:\n- Okay graphics, I'm being modest. It kinda looks pretty.\n- Crafting, the crafting minigame is 10x better than the game itself. (it gets annoying after the first time though)\n- There's food. If that makes a change. I guess it's a nice feature.\n\nCons:\n-Missing sounds, lots of audio bugs.\n-Missing textures, lots of graphical bugs.\n-The most threatening enemy are monkies.\n-AI for the human enemies are not intellegent at all. No pathfinding skills and has an area of awareness around them, making stealth impossible.\n-The weapons are the following: Bone Machete, Old Pistol (Flintlock pistol), Modern Pistol and a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ed Alien Wristrocket. The bone machete doesn't do crap, the old pistol is a two hit kill and the modern pistol and wristrocket are 1 shot kills. You are way too OP in this game against the tribe people.\n-Lack of Explanation. Why did your plane crash and why the hell are the monkies OP and kill you slowly and silently? ( This would probably be explained if I finished the game, I just couldn't bring myself to do it)\n-Saving is trash. If you're saving to quit and play again another day, you'll be lucky to not find your save file corrupt. You have to play through Garry's Accident in one sitting.\n-The puzzles are annoying, extremley simple yet take forever to solve.\n- You have a hunger and Thirst bar but don't worry about getting food and water, they don't decrease because it's broken like this game overall.\n\nDon't buy this. I wanted to laugh at how bad this is but I can never get my money back, sadly. I even bought it on sale for $1 and it still wasn't even worth it. Seems like they spent a lot of their budget in the intro sequence because it's just a downward spiral from there.\n","January 23, 2015","false","1.9"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","86","6","7","4","0"

Why the f* can't he do that, when he has lived in the jungle since he was brought into that weird world by his mother when she died. --- And i say when she died, because everytime you kill a chick it sounds like she gives birth to an idiotic child with rabies.\n\nYou only know what to do in the start and the rest of the game you run around and a pretend you're Bear Grylls lost on Madagascar. There's seriously monkeys running around throwing mangos at you, because they don't feel like eating that god damn mango. If i had a mango right now i would eat it. Those monkeys are some little unthankful c*nts and i hope they get stuck in some top secret mayan stone-trap and get crushed by a giant rock until their eyes pop out.\n\nBut this thing actually is has a positive side too! You wouldn't believe it would you? Well.. If you don't have money for a Far Cry-game and just want cut animals open, you can do that! There's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ pumas running around the jungle, which you can skin with the exact same animation they use in Far Cry! Though it's really bad because it's "Day One: Garry's Incident".

The deluge of derision this game has received is legendary and I don't want to be party to those kinds of criticisms.\n\nDoes that mean Day One: Garry's Incident is a great game? Absolutely not. It's a severely mediocre game but certainly not as bad as other tried-and-true bad games.\n\nIt feels more like a demo for something bigger but cut short by lack of funds or time (or both).\n\nMoreover, Day One feels like the developers couldn't settle on what kind of game they wanted to make.\n\nIs it a survival sim? No. It has a loose bit of "survival-lite" mechanics but that's about it. The survival aspect feels completely tacked on and has very little to do with the overall game or story. The survival mechanics are just a surrogate for more traditional ways of healing in other first-person adventures.\n\nIs it an FPS? Barely. As FPS goes Day One is clunky, slow and awkward. The weapons are uninspired and only the pistol and the alien blaster-thingy are any good. The other weapons are pretty useless. The enemies are\n\nIt is a rip-roaring Indiana Jones-esque adventure? Maybe but the puzzles and traps are poorly designed as to suck any fun the game might have. The traps throughout are tedious trial-and-error speed bumps that force you to save often. The puzzles are dull and equally tedious; the temple complex in the second act, for example, forces the player to hunt down a half-dozen switches to open up the way to the next level, spread out over a ginormous Mayan temple that dwarfs the player that even running non-stop feels slow.\n\nGarry's Incident should be a lesson to its developers: develop a focus; fine tune your gameplay; make sure it's fun. This is where Garry's Mod fails. I can't help think if the developers had just made the effort they could have had a decent game on their hands but instead opted to make a quick buck and release it in a shoddy state.","April 6, 2015","false","7.2"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","69","9","13","3","0"

Some objects cant be jumped upon even when clearly you could. Graphics aren't the best, but they are decent. Gun accuracy should be tweaked a bit since I sometimes miss while aiming right for the chest. Other than that seems like a good idea for a game. Not much creativity is expected from games these days since there are so many, but it has it's charm.\nAlso some extended item description would be helpful, since you just kinda guess for example how much water or food you can get from certain things and if you have water in your flask.\nI would only sudjest anyone to buy and play this as a last resort, since it seems incomplete.","April 11, 2015","false","1.9"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

The game has the potential to be a fantastic game, but that's where to upside ends.\n\nThe game is buggy beyond all means.  I first started noticing bugs on the title screen,  I mean if you can't even get the title screen correct, what's the point in trying to complete the game.\n\nThen there's the issue of their scripts pretty well kill you even when you have won the button mashing tasks they give you.  I got into a struggle with a panther & even though I won the struggle, the outcome was that both the panther & myself ended up dead requiring me to reload the game.  I decided to shut it off rather than reloading.\n\nThe worst part of the game is not the game itself, but the developers.  There has been a lot of controversy surrounding this game since it was released & most of it has to do with abuse of the legal system to censor legitimate bad reviews.  There are a number of allegations that Wild Games Studio has also made false metacritic & other positive reviews to boost their game (I don't know if there are any actual facts in this, but there's a TON of information on Wikipedia[en.wikipedia.org] about it.\n\nI would probably recommend this game in the future if the developers could fix the majority of the bugs, but at this time I would have to say that somebody would have to have some extremely bad luck to even have this game gifted to them.  This game still doesn't top the situation with WarZ/Infestation: Survivor Stories by Hammerpoint Interactive, but it isn't far off...\n\nGames like this & WarZ/Infestation: Survivor Stories are the reasons why allowing indie games to get on Steam was probably a bad idea, it only tarnishes Steam's rep.  I would have to say that this game should probably be removed from Steam, but first off we know the developers are going to put up a fight over it & secondly, we may never see any fixes to the numerous bugs currently in the game.  I have no idea why WarZ/Infestation: Survivor Stories was even re-added to Steam, that game is an obvious scam if I ever saw one & a blatant ripoff of other games, movies, etc.; the lawsuit against them from Warner Bros. was proof enough of that.","December 11, 2013","false","1.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","2"

I watched a video by cynical brit about it and I think that the reason it has such low reviews is because of him... not because it's actually that bad (I mean it's bad but not so bad that it would get "overwhelmingly poor").

I thought $4 was a good price to pay for it, that it was worth a shot at that price. I was wrong.\n\nI should have listened to the overwhelming array of negative reviews. It seems to be using an old Unreal engine, like maybe the Unreal 2 engine or something, and the controls are just awkward. There are slowdowns (for seemingly no reason), long loading times, and this all spells a bad experience without even getting into the poor graphic quality and poor audio quality (yes, I know it's indie, I took that into account).\n\nTrying to exit the game after my 47 minutes of buggy playtime was an experience in itself. My system hung on a black screen for around 10 minutes (couldn't even CTRL+ALT+DEL), and my computer was slow for another 10 or so minutes after that with the harddrive being hammered the whole time. It even managed to crash the audio driver in Ventrillo (which I was logged into in the background). The error message said something about too much data being forced through the sound driver.\n\nOverall, my experiences with Day One were not unique, and I just cannot recommend this game to anyone.","February 22, 2014","false","0.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Do no buy this game. It's just not worth it. Not because it's bad, it's just not worth $20 for 2 to 3 hours of gameplay. I can't even explain this game. When I started playing, I knew it was poorly made. However, I had to beat it. The so called "Story" just wasn't there. You do not do anything! You just wonder around looking for anything. The only thing you actually do is solve the "puzzels" to get to the next part. Food and Water are barely even an issue. When you complete each part of the area, and you start the others, you get full health and hydration. It is too easy to actually finish this chapter without actually having to eat or drink. I looked a few things up about this game and learned that the creator plans to do multiple chapters. Word of advice creator, if you plan to make more chapters after this one, for the love of god do it right. Take your time, and for the love of god, DO NOT CHARGE $20 DOLLARS FOR IT! 2 to 3 hours of clunky gameplay is not a good idea! For god sakes, The Walking dead only charged $5 for their chapters! That should be the most you charge.

Do no buy this game. It's just not worth it. Not because it's bad, it's just not worth $20 for 2 to 3 hours of gameplay. I can't even explain this game. When I started playing, I knew it was poorly made. However, I had to beat it. The so called "Story" just wasn't there. You do not do anything! You just wonder around looking for anything. The only thing you actually do is solve the "puzzels" to get to the next part. Food and Water are barely even an issue. When you complete each part of the area, and you start the others, you get full health and hydration. It is too easy to actually finish this chapter without actually having to eat or drink. I looked a few things up about this game and learned that the creator plans to do multiple chapters. Word of advice creator, if you plan to make more chapters after this one, for the love of god do it right. Take your time, and for the love of god, DO NOT CHARGE $20 DOLLARS FOR IT! 2 to 3 hours of clunky gameplay is not a good idea! For god sakes, The Walking dead only charged $5 for their chapters! That should be the most you charge.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/harkartbaggins/recommended/242800/","harkartbaggins","Lucien","http://steamcommunity.com/id/harkartbaggins/","363 products in account","This game has had so many chances to be updated to a better game, scene as though it was made in september last year, but it's possibly the worst game I have played in a while, and that includes Ride to Hell...\n\nPlease note that I have only got passed the bit where you get out of the temple and the guy steals your flask but I had to stop playing as it was giving me a headache.  The game starts with you in a temple where you have to fight a man that looks like he was made out of cardboard by a three year old. The fighting is literally F to block and click the mouse buttons to kill the guy.  However, when you kill him, he disappears somewhere (I would probably find out where if I carried on playing).  The fighting in this game, to say it's a survival game, should be intense and exciting, but turns out to be a big pile of poop, pressing a button every now and then.\n\nThen you are posed with the question of, should I save this woman?  Because in the game, he says that it could kill him if he saves her, but if you do save her, nothing actually happens to you or her... she just sits where she was for the next year or so.\n\nThe game tells you what to do but not where to do it, so either tell us what to do, or not at all.  It's really annoying having a survival game that tells you what to do after 2 minutes of exploration.  Then, when something actually happens, for example; you see someone, in a normal survival game, it starts to get really intense and exciting, but in this game, it zooms really weirdly taking all of the intensity out of it.\n\nThen we get onto the buugs... where do I start?\n\nFirst off, when I went down into the depth of the temple (a couple of feet down under ground), I found a gun and thought that this was a turning point for the game.  Maybe I could now choose whether to fight loud or go in really stealthy, but no, as soon as the next cut-scene comes, the gun was taken out of my inventory never to be seen again.\n\nSecondly, when things start to fall, things hover in the air (again, could be part of the game) but for me, you can't get close to the rocks without there being an invisable wall.  This makes the 'survival' game really restrictive.   When I was trying to do a simple task of walking down the stairs, I couldn't as there was a rock above me.  I tried to crouch, thinking that maybe I needed to, but nope, that didn't work either.\n\nThis game is terrible and I wouldn't even wish it onto my worst enemy.\n\nWhatever you do, do not waste £15 on this game.  I wouldn't even spend 50p on it, this game should be free, heck, they should pay us to play it.\n\nHow can I get my money back?","February 25, 2014","false","0.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I thought $4 was a good price to pay for it, that it was worth a shot at that price. I was wrong.\n\nI should have listened to the overwhelming array of negative reviews. It seems to be using an old Unreal engine, like maybe the Unreal 2 engine or something, and the controls are just awkward. There are slowdowns (for seemingly no reason), long loading times, and this all spells a bad experience without even getting into the poor graphic quality and poor audio quality (yes, I know it's indie, I took that into account).\n\nTrying to exit the game after my 47 minutes of buggy playtime was an experience in itself. My system hung on a black screen for around 10 minutes (couldn't even CTRL+ALT+DEL), and my computer was slow for another 10 or so minutes after that with the harddrive being hammered the whole time. It even managed to crash the audio driver in Ventrillo (which I was logged into in the background). The error message said something about too much data being forced through the sound driver.\n\nOverall, my experiences with Day One were not unique, and I just cannot recommend this game to anyone.","February 22, 2014","false","0.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The first time I started up the game, it took several minutes to load up, and when I finally reached the main menu, it was laggy as hell and the music was stuttering. My computer is not the best one on the market, but it can run other new games, like Rust, perfectly and without any issues. And the real kicker was that none of the advanced graphics options were even turned on by default!\n\nOnce I fixed the graphics issues, I started the game up. The first thing I noticed was that the character animation is sloppy, and is honestly done half-♥♥♥♥♥. The gameplay feels lazy, like it was something that should have been made for windows 95. Playing the original Unreal is a better experience, and a far more visually enjoyable one as well. I won't even get into all of the terrible things about this game, but don't waste your money on it. Even if it goes free for a weekend, DO NOT BUY IT! It's games like these that are a blemish on the industry, and if this studio goes under, I don't think anyone will be sad about it.\n\n","January 31, 2014","false","0.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Stephane I would like to state that this is not me harrassing you. It is me simply criticizing you. I hope you understand that the game is a good concept but the way the developers don't listen to anyone is terrible and not something that should happen. I hope oyu have watched the TotalBiscuit video on you ILLEGALLY abusing the copyright claims just because he wrote something you disliked. We are in a generation of web and games. There are criticizers good and bad. Listen to both. Take action to what they say, meaning improve. You are only running away from something that's faster. I would have enjoyed the game if you didn't so desperately post fake reviews and such and sugar coated it all. Now, you may ban me but you know that I am correct and here is legitimate evidence of my truth. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfgoDDh4kE0 Read this and if you want your respect back apologize to the whole community to release a game that didn't need to be over hyped, which inturn proved to be an atroscity to what it was shown to be. Do us the favor and publicly apologize.\n\nP.S.

My $7,000,000,000 computer over at NASA can run this game at a smooth 20fps. The combat and stealth systems are completely flawless. I believe that they worked very hard on these stealth and combat controls. The combat is very fast paced and definitaly puts your life on the line. The tactic that always works for me personally, is to crouch as soon as I can low health. This way, the enemies can't hit me. I can then easily run away to the camp. When I do decide to fight, its very difficult and makes my heart race. As long as I keep hitting the enemy, they won't move. At all.\n\nOverall, this is a great game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/meatym8blazeit/recommended/242800/","meatym8blazeit","Sashank","http://steamcommunity.com/id/meatym8blazeit/","79 products in account","This game. Oh this game. Is absolutely terrible I mean ok the graphics are mediocre and atleast draws the players attention away from the teleporting panthers, floating dead tribal priestesses and trees which you and NPCs can no-clip through. This game has an awkward combat system and if you have played the MOBA, League of Legends the combat system is very similar to the playstyle of the champion, Tryndamere as it is a simple as spam click your mouse to kill overpowered enemies with one shot capabilities.\n\nThe game is extremely close to being unplayable as the bugs and glitches ruin the gameplay as the no-clipping of NPCs and the player breaks the game and is frustrating when you try to hunt a monkey with an unlimited pile of rocks and it just runs through a tree and if you are trying to escape from an enemy you end up getting stuck in an invisible wall. The performance of this game is paralysing as at low or high graphics I always seem to dip below 30fps which is appalling as a fully released game isn't even optimised to perform at or above 60fps without any dips. The storyline can be destroyed as I was testing if the game was buggy (which it is) I accidentally killed the NPC who gave me a quest and this is terrible(I never got my flask back ;_;)\n\nI still think this game has a lot of potential as this concept is amazing! Who wouldn't want a survival game where you can hunt and live in the wild. It also strays away from the zombie environment other survival games feature which is perfect as I would prefer a variation and since it didn't take that path it doesn't fail as hard as other zombie survival games (WarZ).\n\nFinal Verdict: This game is extremely unpolished and doesn't live up to the standards we gamers expect but the concept is amazing and I really would like to see and improvment in the near future but for now I don't think it is a great game\n\n2/10\n\n\n","February 20, 2014","false","1.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Its not as bad as the reviews put out. Game only crashed once, and i got stuck under the rocks at the very beginning after i picked up the arm weapon because i did not move right away, and i did not die. but so far quite smooth. hopefully it was just a hiccup.\nI will complete garry's incident, i just got it despite all those terrible reviews and will give a detailed truth be told opinion of this game from an old school gamer. Downloading now.......\ni have been playing video games since calecovision and atari 2600, my first computer was a tandy, took 10 hours to program hangman to play for 5 min.\nAnd now... On my 360, have been and was the all time gears of war #1 ranked in all ranked matches for 3 years solid. Hope my review helps.\n\nok So far, I have journeyed into the wilderness into some unknown amazon, with crazy lil monkeys and panthers that race out of no where at you. Paint faced tribunal men that look like cannibals, and the freindly villiage people. Garrys Incident is not that bad, I am still going to finish this game, may take me a while as i play mulitiple games, but i will.\nSo far its not bad. I am not sure where the developer was going with this as it is like other games, just an amateur version.\nIts a wonder that unreal engine is not being used to its fullest potential as i know from personal experience that unreal engine is sleek, with very fast elements for certain games, like Unreal tournament.\nI could say this would be a great first timer game getting into these types of games i guess as it seems quite hard, But to support a developer for 2 bucks is ok by me, so essentially i just bought a coffee.\nSo far the game is actually quite hard, the crazy cannibals keep freaking me out i tried to sneak up on one but i can not seem to sneak attack, as soon as he knows your there its game on, its like the dude has just gone on insane mode, the reviews about garry's incident should be re-evaluated as i am not sure if people just have a hate on for the developer or not but i am sure these people are hatin cause they die, just like i have been, So if you think your getting ripped off, really your not as i have seen poopier games cost way more, when you think of the time, budget allowed, coding, animations, how many are working on it plus the payout of developers time really when you think about it, its change that he is making in the end of all the costs, If you enjoy games and story lines then i am 80% sure you will see what i see. But for overall grafic's its ok, but not great. i play on the highest settings but still does not really affect the game that much other than clear everything up but still pixels. I hope the devs really appreciate my review, I am quite a critic in life and can not say its as bad as everyone is saying, it just needs a little TLC and maybe some good freinds for moral support. You have a great engine to use there dev, so please use it. I am sure you did not get your education to be ridiculed over a game, personally i got this game because of all the bad reviews, it was almost forcing me to buy it as i wanted to make sure a hidden gem was not being disgruntled for no reason, It may not be a diamond, but it does shine, just needs some polish, plus you devs should also have youtube videos to support this game. I honestly could give donation coding to you if you like as i also used to do this for a hobby, and would even sign a waiver that you have all rights to the coding i give ya, i know legals and do not mind helping out behind the lines with no need for credit in any way other than the fact i could tell my grandkids about it. just not professionally but could have as i did get an interview with epic in toronto years ago when i applied through my xbox360, had no where to live after i got there, plus knew no one so i did not bother, i just kept on lobster fishing and working for a domain name provider.  I did catch the bottle of jack daniels at the beginning clearly labled as it used to be my favorite drink. So cheers, lets make some boiler makers... or apple jacks\nIf you do not know what a boiler maker is ill tell ya...\n\n2 Oz of jack daniels\n1 Bottle of beer.\n1 large enough glass to hold all of the beer and the shot glass.\nFill glass with cold beer.\nready yourself...\ndrop the shot in the glass of beer.\nas soon as you see the shot glass is on the bottom, takes 1 sec\nchug your glass as fast as you can to empty.....\n\napple jacks\n\nyour favorite ice cold apple juice or cider\nmix with jack #7 to taste mmmm\n\nlet me know how many you could handle if you try it....","September 29, 2015","true","2.5"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","36","4","11","3","0"

And for a price where you buy a hamburger for which is done in a few minutes, I wanted to see and experience this game myself.\n\nThe title screen was promising, I thought it was a zombie survival game, put when the gameplay started I was surprised. Nevertheless, I gave it shot. There were some rage moments (thus challenges to overcome), the puzzles were easy but some of them are almost impossible because of hitboxes that it made me almost quit the game entirely. But I kept playing it. The game evolved into a strange put urgent situation that I had to finish it, I don't know why.\n\nTook me 4.3 hours, most of the time is at that spot where the hitboxes are ♥♥♥♥ed up and another level which was surprisingly extremely fun. I once got stuck at a certain point where I had to restart the game 10 times but eventually finished it and I must say that the game has potention but it's not quite visible. And 30% of it was extremely entertaining.\n\nDo I recommend it? Yes and no, but I do wait for the next episode!!! Can't wait! Developers? Don't see those bad reviews as a sign to stop making the next episode, learn from them instead. I am sure, the second episode will be a blast!\nBut the game is playable to the end and it can entertain you for a few hours, in comparisation with the money you pay for it.\n\nI understand why people hate this game, don't be spoiled, the game has potention but is a bit worked out poorly. But it also has a lot of details, a lot of unneeded details in fact, but still. I had, unlike the complications it sometimes had, fun. YES! I HAD FUN!!! So there you have it, take it or leave it. Every person is different and you might be one of them, that appreciates a game like this.","November 28, 2014","true","9.7"," 6 of 17 people (35%) found this review helpful","35","6","17","0","1"

When we hear "Day One: Garry's Incident", we groan in agony. No one wants to suffer this abomination. It's a glitchy mess! It's like Far Cry's fourteenth cousin twice removed. Is it bad? Yes. It is. But, that's the thing. It's so bad, it's good. Because it's so bad, it's hilarious. It's all in good fun if you don't take it seriously.\n\nNow let's get down to business (A.K.A. the first five minutes of the game):\nYou play as Garry, some middle-aged man who flies a plane over this inconspicious island. He's going to deliver some wooden crates. To where? No one knows. A volcano erupts, causing the island to explode, and a crate glows, creating a portal that somehow saves Garry's life. And now Garry is captured by male island natives, and they bring him to this temple. Garry is binded in rope. He gets himself free. He has himself a battle with a male islander that thinks he's a worthy opponent against Garry's bone machete. The islander dies a fabulous death. Garry saves a tribal female. Thus, you begin your journey as Garry.\n\nWhat was the incident that occurred that involved Garry? Who the hell knows?\n\nThere are trading cards. That means you can craft a badge. That means you can get a Garry-rific background for your profile. That means you can get a few cents for your wallet funds.\n\nChances are you'll get the Garry card for all three card drops. That happened to me.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/KillerCookiezz/recommended/242800/","KillerCookiezz","BergMerk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/KillerCookiezz/","242 products in account","After finishing this game, I have to say, that I cannot agree with ANY of the reviews I have seen for this game. Truthfully, I originally only purchased this game so that I could 'experience' it myself, as everyone said it was absolutely terrible and that I should "Buy a sandwich instead" (I got it on sale for 1.89 euro), but upon actually playing it myself, I enjoyed it and wanted to go back and play it again as soon as I got home from school. Sure, Healing was a pain as it took about 20 seconds to do, and at one point about 30 monkeys spawned at once and drove me insane, but the game as a whole was enjoyable.\n\nThere's stealth (Not very realistic stealth mind you, but it felt good to sneak up behind an enemy and watch him/her tumble to the ground), Puzzles, exploration, crafting, food and water meters and large maps to make you really feel like you're lost in the jungle. The fighting wasn't the most exciting thing ever, but it wasn't hard or frustrating either. Once you get the M9, 2 shots and you've killed a guy. One shot for the animals. It allowed me to go through the levels without ever feeling stressed or annoyed, which, to me, is a good thing.\n\nMaybe I just got lucky, but the game only crashed once, and there were little to no bugs that I encountered throughout the whole game. I got out of the map at one point, but that can happen in any game (Skyrim being one) and doesn't make the game any worse (Better if anything! Getting out of the map is fun). The game also ran at full fps with near max settings for me so that wasn't a problem either.\n\nI know how hard it is to develop a game (I am a developer myself), and so I think they did a really good job considering they're just a small indie company, and it's terrible to see just how rude, disrespectful and heartless people are when it comes to this game. Sure, I found them funny when I first saw them, as I had never seen what the game was really like, but those comments prevent others from wanting to try the game (Myself included), which is unfair to both the developers and the people who are missing out.\n\nIs it worth 19 euro? Not at all. Was it worth the 1.89 euro that I bought it for? Every last cent. Heck, I'd pay 10 euro for this game and not feel dissapointed! Again, maybe I got lucky, but I really do recommend you try this game yourself next time it's on sale and see if YOU think it's as bad as everyone has stated.\n\nIf I were to give this a proper rating, I'd give it about a 8/10 (Keeping in mind that it is only an indie game). It was very enjoyable and challenging at times, with good platforming parts, interesting puzzles, hidden secrets and easy but satisfying combat, but it's unnecessary crafting, long healing times, quick-time events, short game length (I finished it in less than 3hrs) and high asking price (Buy it when it's one sale) hold it back from being any higher of a score. However, I still highly recommend you give it a go yourself when you get a chance.","May 7, 2014","true","3.2"," 5 of 17 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","5","17","0","0"

It really doesn't deserve all the hate. Here's a run down of the game and may I tell you now it can have a few spoilers so be warned.\n\nDay One: Garry's Incident takes place on a beautiful, luscious, eye candy of an island with amazing visuals and sound design that you really feel like you are in the world. You play as a character respectfully known as Garry. (I personally think he is a hunk, I would bury my face in that teddy bear beard of his and never let go of him. Garry is my true lord and savior and I would give up everything to be with him forever). Now, you crash land on an island after a giant anomaly hits Garry's plane, but miraculously he survives, and is taken in by a group of very nice tribal men who offer him tea and buiscets for the small small price of his squishy anal virginity. He refuses and they strap him down, man handling him like never before and they take him on a true ride. Now here is a big spoiler, the tribal men who are pretty hunky themselves have some fairly large horse ♥♥♥♥♥ which they release upon Garry, but he manages to break free from his restraints and take down what used to be the nicest men he had ever met. (They had sweet smiles that may have been semi-erotic but we will never know because Garry killed the ♥♥♥♥ out of them. And possibly had his way with them. Necrophelia is a huge fetish of mine.) This is where Garry escapes the tomb he had been soccumbed into, and he embarks on a journey to find true love, adventure, and hard liqour.\n\nThank you for reading my review! I put a lot of time and effort in both the game and this review and I hope you enjoy Day One: Garry's Incident as much as I did! Oh! And before I forget, the game runs at a beautiful and constant 130 Frames, and never drops. It works surprisingly well. And the enemy AI is extremely smart. Seeking you out, and throwing grenades in mass in whichever trench or fox hole you wind up in. Reminds me of the good ol' World At War days. Except they throw fart bombs. More deadly. More silent. Anyways...\nI rate this game a 9 out of 10, the only thing lacking is the amount of playtime that you can put in without there being music, I heard the game has a massive beautiful sound track conducted by Hans Zimmer, the guy who did the MW2 soundtrack (Which I love so much!) but I guess theres a bug. But I trust these dev's will hammer out that little minor bug and get the sexy tunes rolling into my ears soon enough. Well, until next time!","December 21, 2015","true","35.0"," 4 of 15 people (27%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","27","4","15","0","0"

Sure, it is not perfect, but nothing truly is. I see this to be like another Bubsy 3D, a gem that is simply thrown into the trash by people with unrealistic standards. Not everyone can create a Triple A budget title, and have to make do with the tools available to them. And in this regard, I see Day One: Garry's Incident as a rather fine title. If I were to change only one thing, it would be  to have multiple areas which would load separately, so not to stress the system too much. This simple fix could turn this B- game into an A for me.\n\nDon't fall victim to this blackhole of negativity. This is hardly one of the worst games ever, like so many claim. I mean, if it were that bad, it'd have been taken Steam by now, like so many other titles. Such as Ride to Hell and War Z.\n\nTo conclude my report, this game is a fine deal for the low price it is at. Just do not expect it to be on par with something like the Nathan Drake series, which I feel this is very comparable to in terms of setting, themes, and characters.\n\nThank you for reading, and I hope anyone who decides to purchase this title will see the positives to it. Such as a nice variety of weapons, a crafting system, and survival mode which I feel surpasses that of Rust, Garry's other project.","January 15","true","3.8"," 2 of 11 people (18%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","18","2","11","0","0"

The Worton twins are adorable as Garry Bink, however; the audience produced an audible coo the first time they saw him on the screen." He gave the film 1 1/2 stars. His partner, Gene Siskel, however, liked the film because he thought that young children will love it for the survival elements.\n\nAlso, not all other reviews were negative. Hal Hinson, writing for the Washington Post wrote, "The pace is quick and efficient but never frantic...almost everything in the picture is just right, including the two-bit crooks who abduct the incidental man and end up bruised and begging hilariously for mercy.
