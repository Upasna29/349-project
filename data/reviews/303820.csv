"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RhysMusique/recommended/303820/","RhysMusique","xParallax","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RhysMusique/","95 products in account","So I bought this reading the poor reviews and thinking 'If it's based on the older rugby games, I really enjoyed them and it can't be /that/ bad. It is.\n\nPROS:\nOfficial Names for most european clubs and official names for their players.\nA small bit of potential for a massive re-develop of this game.\nSome nice implementations of kits and stadia.\nNice user interface.\n\nCONS:\n-No way to re-map your controls, so the game is stuck in the down right stupid controls that they have implemented.\n\nPassing (1/10): Left and right pass are the same button, and it depends on where you move the thumbstick (also run)... so basically you have to run in the direction you want to pass. When the player passes, they often glitch up and pass it the wrong direction for the animation, and the receiving player glides 10 metres up the pitch to receive the ball. Forward passes are also not a rule in the game, and though this often works to your advantage, it strongly affects the realism of this game which is very bad. All of this makes for a highly jumpy and disjointed flow of the game, actually no flow at all.\n\nRunning (5/10): This is /okay/, but theres no way to differentiate between jogging and sprinting as there is in most sports games. It's full speed or nothing.\n\nKicking (3/10): Place kicking is quite easy, and I actually like the thumbstick power controls for this, however all other aspects of kicking are horrendously buggy and hard to perfect. The ball often goes in the opposite direction to where you kicked it, just like the passing, and there is no marker or guideline of where the actual kick is headed, you have to gauge it by how much you've moved the stick, and even then it bugs up and totally goes in the opposite direction.\n\nRucks, Mauls, Scrums and Lineouts (5/10): This section of the game is /okay/ but it has serious bug problems yet again. The controls are very simple to use, and you win everything pretty much. I'd like more of a challenge, as rugby often is in this area of the game. However, when you go to pass from of the ruck or scrum, the ball more often than not goes in the opposite direction than you assigned.  Before the ruck comes the tackle, and the mechanics for tacking are buggy and inconsistent too. I've had a player just fall over, and a player on the other side of the screen do a tackling animation.\n\nOVERALL SUMMARY:\n\nWhere the devs could improve:\nMake the game more fluid with the passing and running, and implement 'run' and 'sprint' into the game.\nComplete overhaul of the passing and kicking mechanics.\nComplete re-think of the button mapping or better button customisability.\nAdd markers or guides to where kicks are headed and a nicer overall explanation to kicks in general.\nComplete overhaul of the tackling mechanics\n\nI sincerely hope the developers care enough about this game and its community enough to try to make a change with this game, and with their next, hopefully improved game, I think should be given to the community who bought this game for free or a reduced price. The trailer and the features they have listed give a very wrong impression of the game. I cannot help but pick out the piece thats starting me in the face saying 'Rugby 15 is the best rugby simulation ever made.' IT IS NOT IN THE SLIGHTEST. Rugby 2001 by EA sports was actually much better than this. The names of the players are incorrect in the International teams, which arguably is the style of rugby most players would like to play. Overall, this game seems very rushed indeed, and I would much rather have seen a very nice polished Rugby 16 with correct game mechanics and a nice user experience, rather than this lacklustre attempt at copying a 7 year old game which was, for the record, MUCH better.","December 29, 2014","false","10.2"," 65 of 71 people (92%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","92","65","71","6","0"

To me it's like they used fifa 06 player models. I expected better, I mean hb studios had something to do with madden right so why couldn't they give us better player models?  Only 2 camera views. Really? End on and side on with no zoom or other settings!! Not great.\n\nIn terms of gameplay the controls are fairly smooth and it does play well, certainly less button mashing than other rugby games of the past. Having only just started playing it is just an initial impression, I found it easy enough to do the basics at least.\n\nThe game lacks the customisation options I think. You can change players names and heights and positions but I can't seem to find where you can change their appearance, maybe I am missing something or team names either. Also the super 15 squads are completely different from the international squads so it is hard to know if you changed a player's name in super rugby, whether its the same player in an international team.\n\nSo far I am 50/50 on this game. It seems a little juvenile for an HD quality game (stuck at least 4-5 years ago in respect to  Graphics and models). Certainly with all the mods and customisation and player modelling RC2 seems to be the better game honestly, although the gameplay is actually quite good. If they could improve the player models then this game would be better. Unfortunately we suffer again when it comes to rugby games","November 21, 2014","false","9.2"," 61 of 82 people (74%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","74","61","82","5","0"

They then brought out World Cup 2011 which was basically Rugby 08 upgraded to almost HD gfx and with online play. With the this next iteration they threw the baby out with the bath water. The graphics are worse, there's no online multiplayer and most importantly they changed the whole physics and game mechanics, which was was actually what stood out for me. It felt like you were in control of the players, which is not the case with Rugby 15. I just can't believe that someone can put this game out there and charge $36 for it. Probably my own fault. They didn't show any gameplay footage before launch. Also, this game was supposed to be delayed till January and was released in November anyways. This is a testament to how bad the game really is. This game is full of bugs, does not play smoothly and the AI is really bad for a game that has no online play.\n","November 23, 2014","false","2.6"," 23 of 28 people (82%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","82","23","28","3","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rhyswh/recommended/303820/","rhyswh","Rhys","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rhyswh/","58 products in account","I feel robbed, honestly this game would be ok, and only ok if it was free. The fact they charge people for it is day light robbery! How can they get it so wrong, Rugby 08 is better than this in every aspect, even graphics! For a game that came out 7 years later it's embarassing to say the least.\n\nI wouldn't have bought it if EA would let me activate my Rugby 08 game (which I paid for, how is that fair EA!) but I was desperate for a rugby game. I'm gutted I missed the opportunity to buy Rugby Challenge 2.\n\nAnyway, back to this god awful game!\n\nPros: Conversions and Penalty kicks - I quite like the goal kicking, it's quite good.\n\nCons: Everything!\nWhere do I start!\nKicking: Like I said, goal kicking is good but every other type of kick in play is terrible! You have no idea where the ball is going so it's impossible to accurately kick for territory! The other thing is the only way you can clear your lines is to box kick. You will never have time to kick for touch without being tackled! Completely stupid!\n\nRucking: I quite like the controls for rucking, but it's way too easy. On hard I will turnover the ball in every single ruck! Needs to be harder. The other thing is it doesn't seem to make any difference if someone is isolated. You could be in a one man ruck against 3 oppostion players and still win the ball cleanly as long as you hold the right stick in the right place!\n\nMauls: Rubbish, useless! Once it's formed you hardly go anywhere and it's on a timer! So you just go through the motions.\n\nScrums: I like the controls but the hooking doesn't seem to do anything! The whole idea of hooking the ball back is to claim the ball for your team.But if the opposition push you back a yard or 2 you will loose the ball, even if you've already gone forward 5-6 yards!\n\nPassing: Terrible! The worst is passing out of rucks, mauls and scrums. When you pass the ball the recieving player doesn't move until he has caught it! So there is no momentum at all. As soon as the player catches it the defense is on you straight away. It makes a "quick ball" completely useless! The other frustrating thing is the overlap. There is no such thing in this game. For some reason if you do have the overlap, say 3 on 2, as soon as you pass out to the first man the other 2 run behind you and to the inside of you instead of staying on the wing! This means they run towards all the defensive players so you don't get the overlap! Completely stupid and frustrating.\n\nRunning: Again rubbish. All the moves (side step, handoff etc.) are done on the right stick, very simple controls, again I like. But the players have a mind of their own! They hardly ever do it when you ask them to and worst part is they sometimes do it when there's no one in front of them. A few times I've had people run through a gap only to stop dead trying to hand off thin air! As I mentioned earlier though the most frustrating thing ever is the standing still when catching the ball. No running onto the ball so no room to do anything.\n\nLineouts: Not great but it's ok\n\nWeather: I can't believe this one! It doesn't really affect gameplay but my god it shows how lazy they were when making this game. Before the game you can choose the time per half, difficutly, weather and wind speed. Great apart from you have to do it before every game as it doesn't remember your preferences (again pure lazyness!). The stupidest thing though is the weather, you can have it on Random which I leave it on or you can have rain.......and that's it! So if you really wanted a game in the glorious sunshine then you just have to select random and hope you get it, pure lazyness!\n\nReferee: Might as well not be on! The oppostition is offside a lot, usually stood right next to the scrumhalf by the ruck, as soon as he touches the ball he'll get tackled, the ref never calls it. Also forward passes never get called. Very annoying as it's usually when you want a quick ball the opposition is always off side which gives up your advantage!\n\nSeason: The biggest complaint about this is there are no transfers! It's very boring. There are no cut scene animations at all in this game. Not even replays! So everything just starts and ends abruptly! Makes it very dull.\n\nThere are probably loads more rubbish things that annoy me about this game but I even bored of writing about it now!\n\nIf this game was an early access I'd understand and I might even think you could be ok one day, but the fact this is the finished product is embarassing for the developers. They should be ashamed of charging people for this. I would even say the classic Jonah Lomu Rugby game on PS1 was better than this.....in fact it is better than this!\n\nSo as I'm sure you've realised I'm not a fan of this game. I'm really annoyed that I paid for it! Would do anything for rugby challenge 2 on PC or even to just activate my Rugby 08 again!\n\nSo bottom line is keep your money and hope one day someone will make a decent rugby union game! In the meantime I'm just going to look forward to the Rugby League Live 3 game!","February 22, 2015","false","3.1"," 20 of 25 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","20","25","2","1"

More importantly - just like RWC 2011 - it's not fun.\n\nI'm torn between recommending this game so that the developers can consider patching it OR not recommending it because it seems like they didn't care in the first place.\n\nI've played almost every Rugby and Rugby League game, I buy them (on the consoles) in support of the games and hopefully that it will generate enough support to keep them going.\n\nI played this with the xbox 360 controller.\n\nLet's start on the Passing.\nThe ball physics operate, where the ball seems it's pumped with half oxygen and the other half helium.\nWhen passes are made - it's almost too easy to pick out where the ball will be received. Unfortunately, the collision detection (or player detection) is at stage where even if you are in a prime position to intercept (which is all the time) you still won't receive the ball.\nIt has a single pass button only. Whereas previously, it was a 2 button pass option (left button = pass left, right button = pass right). This is a horrible development because you lose the ability to direct players and have players run off the ruck.\n"Apparently" if you hold the pass button and release, the pass will skip the player next to the ball carrier - this happens occasionally. It's a lucky dip.\nYou can use a thumbstick to highlight the receiver and pass it to them, which is a good innovation but requires some fine tuning.\nThe games ability to judge forward passess has gone backwards from the previous itinerations. (i'm talking about Rugby 08 and RWC 11)\n\nThe Kicking.\nAll kicking in general play (grubber, chip and chase, punt and bomb) has a power indicator (which shows how much force you're using) BUT no directional indicator. This means you have to GUESS where your kick is going to go.\nWhen kicking to start play (22 Drop out, Kick restarts) you can move the player in the direction of where you want to kick, but it will only highlight the player (and move him in the direction) and not the direction of the kick.\n\nRucks\nThey've streamlined the ability to win the Rucks and simplified the process, however, they have moved away from one of the challenges of adding and removing players from the ruck. There is NO ability to add a player to ruck. Everything is done automaticly and then you are required to toggle your thumbstick to battle your opponent to win the ruck.\n\nThis mechanic is used again for Scrums and Mauls.\n\nI could go on - (especially about the A.I., Gameplay in general, Offensive and Defensive moves etc) - but most of it would be negative.\n\nThe positives are that the screens are clean. It's visually a pretty game. The money spent on something like Madden vs this make it a no contest. BUT for what it is - it's definitively a graphical improvement over the last few itinerations.\n\nTo be fair, I don't really care about the licensing, I don't care which teams feature - I believe that if a fun game is made, and has alot of depth in the gameplay itself - then everything else is a low priority.\n\nIn alot of ways, had this game been made in early 2000 - it would've been the greatest Rugby game ever.\n\nIt wasn't and it's not yet close to being a good rugby game.\n\nThis game has no depth, it's not fun to play by myself or even with others.\nMaybe some patching will fix some of the issues.\n\nIn writing this - I've decided to NOT recommend the game.","November 25, 2014","false","3.9"," 15 of 20 people (75%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","75","15","20","3","0"

Stealing the ball is pretty easy and the only difference between the different difficultys is that you get more fouls for what you do, and the ai dont. So i play it on medium cause hard just get me frustrated. You got your ball out of the ruck and an ai player comes from behind you and tackles. You pass a ball backwards, try to kick it, get tackeld by ai player and get a foul. The ai kicks the penalty kick, you cache it and run into you next "foulplay". And so it goes the whole game. The sad thing is that playing on medium is just boring and way to easy.\n\nOn top of that the devs are last seen on steamforums somewere in November. I suspect that this game will not be updated and i cant recommend it.\n\n===================================================================\n\nOriginal review from the first week:\nI really like this game. The controlls are really good (I'm using a xBox 360 controller), no button-smashing like in other sport games. The sound is very good and makes a great atmosphere.\nThe graphics are okay, what points on the negative score is the lack of replays. Because of that the game becomes sometimes (especially at foul situations) very quick and confusing, just like real Rugby :D\nSometimes a player tackles the air but thats okay for me, overall the animations are not on top but good enough for me. Some people complain about the lack of an online mode, multiplayer would be nice for a sequell but its no dealbreaker for me. Sport games are best played as local multiplayer with a friend sitting on the same couch. But thats just my opinion.\n\nAs a summary i would say its a good game with potential upwards. The biggest pros are the great atmosphere and the controlls. If you not a next gen-graphics-fetishist you got a good solid rugby game here. And this type of game is unfortunately rare.

On big screen you can actually see details like players breathing. On regular screens you will have problems to see what's actually happening in the game. All these problems come from the game's static camera. You can only choose from left-right or up-bottom. The second choice is useles, because the camera spins every time ball changes possesion to make you lose your last meal. When it comes to feeling from watching the game when not playing it, there are more entertaining sports games from a decade ago.\nWhat do I like about Rugby 15 is the game flow and most of the controlls. Yeah, and the fact that it's a pc rugby game I've been waiting for some couple months.\nHowever, the bigger is the disappointment. It is impossible to properly aim drop goals and punts to gain territory. Players just kick the direction they're facing. And if an opponent runs towards them, they will stop kicking to lose the ball in a knock-on. Avoid hitting the control "A - release useless kick" especially after winning a ruck.\n\nI'm recommending this game to support it's designers in developing a patch to fix the issues. I'm okay with some player suddenly disappearing, but the camera and kicking has to be fixed. Get more budget and make a new release, please! This could seriously kill the series.","November 23, 2014","true","13.4"," 11 of 22 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","11","22","0","0"

Compared to the other rugby games I have played (Rugby '08, Rugby World Cup 2011, and Jonah Lomu's Rugby Challenge), this gsmr is a bit different and has a learning curve for controls.  Is it a terrible Rugby game? Not in my opinion.  Not the best, but unplayable.\n\nMy analysis:\nPros:\n- It's a virtual rugby game, which there are few that have been made compared to the mainstream sports\n- Updated graphics, compared to the older rugby games\n- Plenty of teams (if not all) and tournament modes to choose\n- Decent GUI (easy to navigate)\n\n\nCons:\n- Glitchy. Passes sometimes goes right when you're passing left, sometimes they'll throw it WAY up in the air, players get caught on scrums / bunched up players / etc,\n- the AI for the opposing team and your inactive teammates is pretty bad.  They tend to stand there when te ball is lying on the ground, defeneders sometimes will back off when you're on the breakaway, will stand there and wait for ball to be passed to them, etc.\n- No group tackling.  While running straight at a group of defenders, only one will attempt to tackle, while the rest stand there dumbfounded and even back away.  This ties into bad AI and adds to the glithiness I mentioned above.\n- Kicking can be better.  On kickoffs, you can't choose the stength, arch, or distance of kick.  You face a direction and press a button...\n- No Multiplayer mode, at least not yet\n\n\nIn short, If you want this game, just buy this if/when it's on sale.  At least we can appreciate that there are people that are trying to make a new rugby game.","June 12, 2015","true","2.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The game itself reminds me of the old rugby games that EA Sports used to make, which is why they most likely why they tried to make the logo for the game look like it was made by a recent EA Group. Make no mistake, you play in the same Field, and the players for every team seem to have the same 20 player models. The announcers did a good job and can make you feel more inclined to play the game. The game itself feels like it is lacking a few big features for any sports games, such as different stadiums and a replay. The game just sorta cuts to the pause screen when you hit halftime and when the game ends. If they could add an instant replay the game would feel like a more complete game. There is no career mode, however you can setup custom tournaments but there is no multiple season game modes. The game is also SUPER GLITCHY. It can add to the fun when you watch players fall through the field and also watching players run in place. This however is a big problem when your player will be on a breakaway and then he will stop and then a player will glitch forward and tackle the player. The game itself runs really well, I run Windows 10 and have 8GB of ram and a non-gaming intel processor and I have been playing on the highest setting. The game does perform well for the $7 price tag that I picked it up for, but for 39.99 it is not worth picking up. Wait for it to go on sale or go to gamestop and look for a rugby game for the xbox 360. This is basically EA Sports Rugby games from back in 2005. I like the game, but wait for a sale.","December 1, 2015","true","5.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The graphics seem outdated and all of the players look alike.\n\nThe game claims to have real teams but you will find the international teams such as; England, Wallabies, Boks and All Blacks are not and just use the respective country's names and flags. As mentioned above the players for these teams are generic too. They all look the same size and ethnicity. This might be because the camera angle is quite high but in my opinion that takes away detail as players start to look like ants.\n\nThere seems to be some bugs in the game where players disappear. This happens most frequently after a maul. I contacted the developers last week about this to see if there was a patch but I have not heard back from them.\n\nWhile I respect the work it takes to make a game it doesn't reach my expectations considering the price and I probably should have done some research and watched some lets play videos to see what it was like but as it stands I am nonplussed with this game and looks like I'll be moving on.

Sure it has its problems but if you can look past a few minor missing elements you will find a rugby game with loads of potential and hours of replayability. The game is not perfect by any means yet in some strange way, thats what makes it so unique and fun to play. Its unpredictable at times, the AI cannot be so easily figured out, as with many other Rugby games.

An excellent deal and thus i dont feel as bad after purchasing this for it's regular $40.00/  €35.17. The review will begin now.\n\nI have not played too much,  but i have played more than enough to give a good opinion and i have seen the most positive and most negative aspects of this game.\n\nFirst off what you see,\nGraphics:\nBeing far from the pitch you cant see much detail even if you tried and due to not bieng any camera angles that bring you that close everything looks quite crisp and smooth. Sadly however the crowd is obviosuly nothing but pixelated flat sprites, but the game helps it self by adding a fake depth of field effect over them so they are much less atrocious to view.\nThe lighting effects are rather good and allow good color to pop through, there is nothing special or fancy about this game; no HBAO or SSAO not even actual blades of grass protruding from the ground and many animations are glitched up from time, but everything is so fast paced and far you dont notice much.  Running on the Unity Engine the game is optimized and looks good enough, however not at all what i'd call "Next Gen" Rugby Challenge 2 crushes Rugby 15 graphically however it too had glitches in animation. Overall the gaphics of this dont truly hurt it at all. Graphics 7/10\n\nGameplay:This game seriously wanted to try something new, not only to rugby video games, but every sporting video game. You dont simply press a button to pass the ball, you must aim in the general area of the player you wish to pass it to then press RT. This mechanic sadly however causes many glitches in this game, such as the ball going through an opposing team player simply phasing through them. The game's engine is very,very easy on you as you can accidentally pass foward without any penalty, but this mechanic seriously allows this game to be ultra fluid allowing you to not have to hessitate before passing, but unreal god like passes can be made with hardly a chance to get a knock on.\n\nRucks: are great in this game however the player animations are practically non existent just squating and binding onto each other with no real pushing or struggle to speak of making rucks  looking awkward however this does not hinder the overall mechanic as unlike in Rugby Challenge 2 the time to win a ruck is more realistic and theres practically no time having to struggle sadly though this removes the tactical fun in planning out a proper ruck like in RC2.\n\nScrums:are a huge part in rugby and in this game well its not a timing game like in RC2, you seriously just push up and RT to hook the ball and if you feel like it you can just collapse the scrum for fun at the press of the button...yep because why not.\n\nLine Outs:in this game are simulated quite well, you have to prepare the jumper with LT then hold RT to lift them once again no timing like  in RC2 just 3 button presses and skill along with some luck as you do have some time to react to the other team's lineout movements.\n\nFending and overall evading:is quite fun since you do have to aim the right stick towards the opposing player and flick the right stick left or right to sidestep. With the right stick it feels similar to a less andvanced version of NBA 2k 15's Pro Stick.\n\nTrying: Is rather easy in this game due to the AI being a bit stupid, but giving a pretty great fight. To score a try enter the try zone and press the right stick.\n\nTackling:can be certainly easy in Rugby 15 as you just move to stick at the player with the ball to dive, otherwise just run into them and tackle them with your arms, less effective as they can fend, but you have a better change to hit them.\n\nConversions: are a great mini game where you pull the right stick back and push it foward however,accidentally rocking it left or right will screw up your kicking direction.\n\nReplays: dont exist at all and definently kill some of the fun, a good chunk and playing RC2 made me always expect a replay after every penalty is called or every try is made. Without them you feel rather cheated as you cant see where you messed up or that amazing move you made when you being a Right Wing fended that Prop Foward in the face. You just can't recap the game like that sadly. I feel this wasnt included due to the low quality graphics that HB didnt want you to see, but its fine making it feel even more realistic. Even though i rather had seen replays regardless of how bad the graphics are up close.\n\nClosing statement: Rugby 15 is a great fun arcady easy to pick and play Rugby Game where the right stick plays the biggest role and that is the fact that makes this a more enjoyable experience.Sadly however this doesnt feel as realistic as Rugby Challenge 2. I feel less intensity and less immersion when playing Rugby 15, but its certainly a game you can play with you friends(if you by chance do play local multiplayer on PC like me) Playing through a match is fun and something you will never stress about while in Rugby Challenge 2 it feels like there are true stakes as the All Blacks destroy everyone on that game while though tougher than most teams in Rugby 15 they are easily beaten. You just dont get the authentic rugby experience, but as it stands theres nothing wrong with this game(other than the lack of many Licenses to teams, but thats A-Okay! I rate this 7/10 for the price i paid, but for $40 i would say 5/10. Just buy this on sale.\n","June 17, 2015","true","18.4"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

I was looking forward to it but, my first impression so far is, it is missing a few elements of the rugby game at this stage.\n\nControls are not intuitive and/or unecessary complicated (goal kick could have been simpler by pressing a button instead of requiring to flick the directional pad).\nKick in the direction you are facing makes some actions impossible (run back and kick forward ?); passing too often go forward or worse in a totally random direction.\n\nThe game might just require a lot of practice but there is no training mode and one will probably be frustrated a lot before getting it. To me good gameplay should be simple, expertise coming with advanced moves and options, this is not it.\n\nThere is a tutorial that describes the commands (the game manual link on steam will take you to the same tutorial on the rugby 15 website), however it is only a series of screenshots that describe which buttons to use. Also some of the tutorial terms are just wrong: 'shoulder charge' is actually banned in rugby, use of 'miss pass' for cut out pass, or 'soccer' kick.\n\nRucking doesn't flow like a real game and an isolated player won't release the ball. Instead the game forces the ruck mode straight away even if only 2 or more vs 1. You will have to wait for more players to come in.\nCounter ruck and scrum make it too easy to get the ball from the opposition. There is no way to leave the ruck uncontested, it's almost like they made a mini game out of it.\n\nAdvantage last forever; even the opposition gains territory you will revert back to the original\n\nPlayer AI seems wrong and not natural e.g. player running passed the opposition, going offside, forward passes...\nTeam AI is rather basic, don't expect great tactical sense and positional play from your teammates.\n\nNot sure if the animation are not accurate or simply buggy, forward passes are not called.\n\nNot necessary a biggy but there is no ref on the field.\n\nMain menu layout is clear and simple, however you won't be able to customise gamepad settings. The game had no problem recognising my xbox wired controller.\nI like the option to switch the game perspective. It's nice to have; personnaly I prefer the 'side-on' view (left to right) rather than 'end-on' (top to bottom) as I feel it gives a more tactical view of the field (as well as being the usual tv angle).\n\nDifferent competitions are available:\n* Licenced: Aviva Premiership, Top 14, Pro D2 and Pro 12\n* Unlicenced (different name): 6 nations, Rugby Championship, super 15 (no team logo, called by their home town) and Heineken Cup\n* World cup: no but you can create a custom cup. There are 20 international teams to play with in friendly or custom.\n\nMultiplayer: none\n\nAs it stands I would not recommend. I'd suggest you wait and see if the game gets improved after a few patches. If this happens I would probably change my recommendation. By then I'll have a bit more practice and with some luck all the issues will have been fixed :D\n\n\nAs it stands I would not recommend. I'd suggest you wait and see if the game gets improved after a few patches. If this happens I would probably change my recommendation. By then I'll have a bit more practice and with some luck all the issues will have been fixed :D\n\nEdit 1 (22 Nov): given the low number of players I am giving a positive rating to encourage the developers. Even if my comments seems harsh they deserve some support for their 1st rugby game. I have faith a few fixes will make for a good game.\n\nEdit 2 (17 Dec): still no patch nor news from the developers since the release. At this stage I can't recommend a game that is broken and not supported :(","November 21, 2014","false","12.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RhysMusique/recommended/303820/","RhysMusique","xParallax","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RhysMusique/","95 products in account","So I bought this reading the poor reviews and thinking 'If it's based on the older rugby games, I really enjoyed them and it can't be /that/ bad. It is.\n\nPROS:\nOfficial Names for most european clubs and official names for their players.\nA small bit of potential for a massive re-develop of this game.\nSome nice implementations of kits and stadia.\nNice user interface.\n\nCONS:\n-No way to re-map your controls, so the game is stuck in the down right stupid controls that they have implemented.\n\nPassing (1/10): Left and right pass are the same button, and it depends on where you move the thumbstick (also run)... so basically you have to run in the direction you want to pass. When the player passes, they often glitch up and pass it the wrong direction for the animation, and the receiving player glides 10 metres up the pitch to receive the ball. Forward passes are also not a rule in the game, and though this often works to your advantage, it strongly affects the realism of this game which is very bad. All of this makes for a highly jumpy and disjointed flow of the game, actually no flow at all.\n\nRunning (5/10): This is /okay/, but theres no way to differentiate between jogging and sprinting as there is in most sports games. It's full speed or nothing.\n\nKicking (3/10): Place kicking is quite easy, and I actually like the thumbstick power controls for this, however all other aspects of kicking are horrendously buggy and hard to perfect. The ball often goes in the opposite direction to where you kicked it, just like the passing, and there is no marker or guideline of where the actual kick is headed, you have to gauge it by how much you've moved the stick, and even then it bugs up and totally goes in the opposite direction.\n\nRucks, Mauls, Scrums and Lineouts (5/10): This section of the game is /okay/ but it has serious bug problems yet again. The controls are very simple to use, and you win everything pretty much. I'd like more of a challenge, as rugby often is in this area of the game. However, when you go to pass from of the ruck or scrum, the ball more often than not goes in the opposite direction than you assigned.  Before the ruck comes the tackle, and the mechanics for tacking are buggy and inconsistent too. I've had a player just fall over, and a player on the other side of the screen do a tackling animation.\n\nOVERALL SUMMARY:\n\nWhere the devs could improve:\nMake the game more fluid with the passing and running, and implement 'run' and 'sprint' into the game.\nComplete overhaul of the passing and kicking mechanics.\nComplete re-think of the button mapping or better button customisability.\nAdd markers or guides to where kicks are headed and a nicer overall explanation to kicks in general.\nComplete overhaul of the tackling mechanics\n\nI sincerely hope the developers care enough about this game and its community enough to try to make a change with this game, and with their next, hopefully improved game, I think should be given to the community who bought this game for free or a reduced price. The trailer and the features they have listed give a very wrong impression of the game. I cannot help but pick out the piece thats starting me in the face saying 'Rugby 15 is the best rugby simulation ever made.' IT IS NOT IN THE SLIGHTEST. Rugby 2001 by EA sports was actually much better than this. The names of the players are incorrect in the International teams, which arguably is the style of rugby most players would like to play. Overall, this game seems very rushed indeed, and I would much rather have seen a very nice polished Rugby 16 with correct game mechanics and a nice user experience, rather than this lacklustre attempt at copying a 7 year old game which was, for the record, MUCH better.","December 29, 2014","false","10.2"," 65 of 71 people (92%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","92","65","71","6","0"

To me it's like they used fifa 06 player models. I expected better, I mean hb studios had something to do with madden right so why couldn't they give us better player models?  Only 2 camera views. Really? End on and side on with no zoom or other settings!! Not great.\n\nIn terms of gameplay the controls are fairly smooth and it does play well, certainly less button mashing than other rugby games of the past. Having only just started playing it is just an initial impression, I found it easy enough to do the basics at least.\n\nThe game lacks the customisation options I think. You can change players names and heights and positions but I can't seem to find where you can change their appearance, maybe I am missing something or team names either. Also the super 15 squads are completely different from the international squads so it is hard to know if you changed a player's name in super rugby, whether its the same player in an international team.\n\nSo far I am 50/50 on this game. It seems a little juvenile for an HD quality game (stuck at least 4-5 years ago in respect to  Graphics and models). Certainly with all the mods and customisation and player modelling RC2 seems to be the better game honestly, although the gameplay is actually quite good. If they could improve the player models then this game would be better.

They didn't show any gameplay footage before launch. Also, this game was supposed to be delayed till January and was released in November anyways. This is a testament to how bad the game really is.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rhyswh/recommended/303820/","rhyswh","Rhys","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rhyswh/","58 products in account","I feel robbed, honestly this game would be ok, and only ok if it was free. The fact they charge people for it is day light robbery! How can they get it so wrong, Rugby 08 is better than this in every aspect, even graphics! For a game that came out 7 years later it's embarassing to say the least.\n\nI wouldn't have bought it if EA would let me activate my Rugby 08 game (which I paid for, how is that fair EA!) but I was desperate for a rugby game. I'm gutted I missed the opportunity to buy Rugby Challenge 2.\n\nAnyway, back to this god awful game!\n\nPros: Conversions and Penalty kicks - I quite like the goal kicking, it's quite good.\n\nCons: Everything!\nWhere do I start!\nKicking: Like I said, goal kicking is good but every other type of kick in play is terrible! You have no idea where the ball is going so it's impossible to accurately kick for territory! The other thing is the only way you can clear your lines is to box kick. You will never have time to kick for touch without being tackled! Completely stupid!\n\nRucking: I quite like the controls for rucking, but it's way too easy. On hard I will turnover the ball in every single ruck! Needs to be harder. The other thing is it doesn't seem to make any difference if someone is isolated. You could be in a one man ruck against 3 oppostion players and still win the ball cleanly as long as you hold the right stick in the right place!\n\nMauls: Rubbish, useless! Once it's formed you hardly go anywhere and it's on a timer! So you just go through the motions.\n\nScrums: I like the controls but the hooking doesn't seem to do anything! The whole idea of hooking the ball back is to claim the ball for your team.But if the opposition push you back a yard or 2 you will loose the ball, even if you've already gone forward 5-6 yards!\n\nPassing: Terrible! The worst is passing out of rucks, mauls and scrums. When you pass the ball the recieving player doesn't move until he has caught it! So there is no momentum at all. As soon as the player catches it the defense is on you straight away. It makes a "quick ball" completely useless! The other frustrating thing is the overlap. There is no such thing in this game. For some reason if you do have the overlap, say 3 on 2, as soon as you pass out to the first man the other 2 run behind you and to the inside of you instead of staying on the wing! This means they run towards all the defensive players so you don't get the overlap! Completely stupid and frustrating.\n\nRunning: Again rubbish. All the moves (side step, handoff etc.) are done on the right stick, very simple controls, again I like. But the players have a mind of their own! They hardly ever do it when you ask them to and worst part is they sometimes do it when there's no one in front of them. A few times I've had people run through a gap only to stop dead trying to hand off thin air! As I mentioned earlier though the most frustrating thing ever is the standing still when catching the ball. No running onto the ball so no room to do anything.\n\nLineouts: Not great but it's ok\n\nWeather: I can't believe this one! It doesn't really affect gameplay but my god it shows how lazy they were when making this game. Before the game you can choose the time per half, difficutly, weather and wind speed. Great apart from you have to do it before every game as it doesn't remember your preferences (again pure lazyness!). The stupidest thing though is the weather, you can have it on Random which I leave it on or you can have rain.......and that's it! So if you really wanted a game in the glorious sunshine then you just have to select random and hope you get it, pure lazyness!\n\nReferee: Might as well not be on! The oppostition is offside a lot, usually stood right next to the scrumhalf by the ruck, as soon as he touches the ball he'll get tackled, the ref never calls it. Also forward passes never get called. Very annoying as it's usually when you want a quick ball the opposition is always off side which gives up your advantage!\n\nSeason: The biggest complaint about this is there are no transfers! It's very boring. There are no cut scene animations at all in this game. Not even replays! So everything just starts and ends abruptly! Makes it very dull.\n\nThere are probably loads more rubbish things that annoy me about this game but I even bored of writing about it now!\n\nIf this game was an early access I'd understand and I might even think you could be ok one day, but the fact this is the finished product is embarassing for the developers. They should be ashamed of charging people for this. I would even say the classic Jonah Lomu Rugby game on PS1 was better than this.....in fact it is better than this!\n\nSo as I'm sure you've realised I'm not a fan of this game. I'm really annoyed that I paid for it! Would do anything for rugby challenge 2 on PC or even to just activate my Rugby 08 again!\n\nSo bottom line is keep your money and hope one day someone will make a decent rugby union game! In the meantime I'm just going to look forward to the Rugby League Live 3 game!","February 22, 2015","false","3.1"," 20 of 25 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","20","25","2","1"

More importantly - just like RWC 2011 - it's not fun.\n\nI'm torn between recommending this game so that the developers can consider patching it OR not recommending it because it seems like they didn't care in the first place.\n\nI've played almost every Rugby and Rugby League game, I buy them (on the consoles) in support of the games and hopefully that it will generate enough support to keep them going.\n\nI played this with the xbox 360 controller.\n\nLet's start on the Passing.\nThe ball physics operate, where the ball seems it's pumped with half oxygen and the other half helium.\nWhen passes are made - it's almost too easy to pick out where the ball will be received. Unfortunately, the collision detection (or player detection) is at stage where even if you are in a prime position to intercept (which is all the time) you still won't receive the ball.\nIt has a single pass button only. Whereas previously, it was a 2 button pass option (left button = pass left, right button = pass right). This is a horrible development because you lose the ability to direct players and have players run off the ruck.\n"Apparently" if you hold the pass button and release, the pass will skip the player next to the ball carrier - this happens occasionally. It's a lucky dip.\nYou can use a thumbstick to highlight the receiver and pass it to them, which is a good innovation but requires some fine tuning.\nThe games ability to judge forward passess has gone backwards from the previous itinerations. (i'm talking about Rugby 08 and RWC 11)\n\nThe Kicking.\nAll kicking in general play (grubber, chip and chase, punt and bomb) has a power indicator (which shows how much force you're using) BUT no directional indicator. This means you have to GUESS where your kick is going to go.\nWhen kicking to start play (22 Drop out, Kick restarts) you can move the player in the direction of where you want to kick, but it will only highlight the player (and move him in the direction) and not the direction of the kick.\n\nRucks\nThey've streamlined the ability to win the Rucks and simplified the process, however, they have moved away from one of the challenges of adding and removing players from the ruck. There is NO ability to add a player to ruck. Everything is done automaticly and then you are required to toggle your thumbstick to battle your opponent to win the ruck.\n\nThis mechanic is used again for Scrums and Mauls.\n\nI could go on - (especially about the A.I., Gameplay in general, Offensive and Defensive moves etc) - but most of it would be negative.\n\nThe positives are that the screens are clean. It's visually a pretty game. The money spent on something like Madden vs this make it a no contest. BUT for what it is - it's definitively a graphical improvement over the last few itinerations.\n\nTo be fair, I don't really care about the licensing, I don't care which teams feature - I believe that if a fun game is made, and has alot of depth in the gameplay itself - then everything else is a low priority.\n\nIn alot of ways, had this game been made in early 2000 - it would've been the greatest Rugby game ever.\n\nIt wasn't and it's not yet close to being a good rugby game.\n\nThis game has no depth, it's not fun to play by myself or even with others.\nMaybe some patching will fix some of the issues.\n\nIn writing this - I've decided to NOT recommend the game.","November 25, 2014","false","3.9"," 15 of 20 people (75%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","75","15","20","3","0"

Stealing the ball is pretty easy and the only difference between the different difficultys is that you get more fouls for what you do, and the ai dont. So i play it on medium cause hard just get me frustrated. You got your ball out of the ruck and an ai player comes from behind you and tackles. You pass a ball backwards, try to kick it, get tackeld by ai player and get a foul. The ai kicks the penalty kick, you cache it and run into you next "foulplay". And so it goes the whole game. The sad thing is that playing on medium is just boring and way to easy.\n\nOn top of that the devs are last seen on steamforums somewere in November. I suspect that this game will not be updated and i cant recommend it.\n\n===================================================================\n\nOriginal review from the first week:\nI really like this game. The controlls are really good (I'm using a xBox 360 controller), no button-smashing like in other sport games. The sound is very good and makes a great atmosphere.\nThe graphics are okay, what points on the negative score is the lack of replays. Because of that the game becomes sometimes (especially at foul situations) very quick and confusing, just like real Rugby :D\nSometimes a player tackles the air but thats okay for me, overall the animations are not on top but good enough for me. Some people complain about the lack of an online mode, multiplayer would be nice for a sequell but its no dealbreaker for me. Sport games are best played as local multiplayer with a friend sitting on the same couch. But thats just my opinion.\n\nAs a summary i would say its a good game with potential upwards. The biggest pros are the great atmosphere and the controlls. If you not a next gen-graphics-fetishist you got a good solid rugby game here. And this type of game is unfortunately rare. I hope the devs sell enough copies to make a sequell.","November 21, 2014","false","8.9"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","5","8","0","0"

On big screen you can actually see details like players breathing. On regular screens you will have problems to see what's actually happening in the game. All these problems come from the game's static camera. You can only choose from left-right or up-bottom. The second choice is useles, because the camera spins every time ball changes possesion to make you lose your last meal. When it comes to feeling from watching the game when not playing it, there are more entertaining sports games from a decade ago.\nWhat do I like about Rugby 15 is the game flow and most of the controlls. Yeah, and the fact that it's a pc rugby game I've been waiting for some couple months.\nHowever, the bigger is the disappointment. It is impossible to properly aim drop goals and punts to gain territory. Players just kick the direction they're facing. And if an opponent runs towards them, they will stop kicking to lose the ball in a knock-on. Avoid hitting the control "A - release useless kick" especially after winning a ruck.\n\nI'm recommending this game to support it's designers in developing a patch to fix the issues. I'm okay with some player suddenly disappearing, but the camera and kicking has to be fixed. Get more budget and make a new release, please! This could seriously kill the series.","November 23, 2014","true","13.4"," 11 of 22 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","11","22","0","0"

Compared to the other rugby games I have played (Rugby '08, Rugby World Cup 2011, and Jonah Lomu's Rugby Challenge), this gsmr is a bit different and has a learning curve for controls.  Is it a terrible Rugby game? Not in my opinion.  Not the best, but unplayable.\n\nMy analysis:\nPros:\n- It's a virtual rugby game, which there are few that have been made compared to the mainstream sports\n- Updated graphics, compared to the older rugby games\n- Plenty of teams (if not all) and tournament modes to choose\n- Decent GUI (easy to navigate)\n\n\nCons:\n- Glitchy. Passes sometimes goes right when you're passing left, sometimes they'll throw it WAY up in the air, players get caught on scrums / bunched up players / etc,\n- the AI for the opposing team and your inactive teammates is pretty bad.  They tend to stand there when te ball is lying on the ground, defeneders sometimes will back off when you're on the breakaway, will stand there and wait for ball to be passed to them, etc.\n- No group tackling.  While running straight at a group of defenders, only one will attempt to tackle, while the rest stand there dumbfounded and even back away.  This ties into bad AI and adds to the glithiness I mentioned above.\n- Kicking can be better.  On kickoffs, you can't choose the stength, arch, or distance of kick.  You face a direction and press a button...\n- No Multiplayer mode, at least not yet\n\n\nIn short, If you want this game, just buy this if/when it's on sale.  At least we can appreciate that there are people that are trying to make a new rugby game.","June 12, 2015","true","2.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The game itself reminds me of the old rugby games that EA Sports used to make, which is why they most likely why they tried to make the logo for the game look like it was made by a recent EA Group. Make no mistake, you play in the same Field, and the players for every team seem to have the same 20 player models. The announcers did a good job and can make you feel more inclined to play the game. The game itself feels like it is lacking a few big features for any sports games, such as different stadiums and a replay. The game just sorta cuts to the pause screen when you hit halftime and when the game ends. If they could add an instant replay the game would feel like a more complete game. There is no career mode, however you can setup custom tournaments but there is no multiple season game modes. The game is also SUPER GLITCHY. It can add to the fun when you watch players fall through the field and also watching players run in place. This however is a big problem when your player will be on a breakaway and then he will stop and then a player will glitch forward and tackle the player. The game itself runs really well, I run Windows 10 and have 8GB of ram and a non-gaming intel processor and I have been playing on the highest setting. The game does perform well for the $7 price tag that I picked it up for, but for 39.99 it is not worth picking up. Wait for it to go on sale or go to gamestop and look for a rugby game for the xbox 360. This is basically EA Sports Rugby games from back in 2005. I like the game, but wait for a sale.","December 1, 2015","true","5.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

As mentioned above the players for these teams are generic too. They all look the same size and ethnicity. This might be because the camera angle is quite high but in my opinion that takes away detail as players start to look like ants.\n\nThere seems to be some bugs in the game where players disappear. This happens most frequently after a maul.

Sadly however the crowd is obviosuly nothing but pixelated flat sprites, but the game helps it self by adding a fake depth of field effect over them so they are much less atrocious to view.\nThe lighting effects are rather good and allow good color to pop through, there is nothing special or fancy about this game; no HBAO or SSAO not even actual blades of grass protruding from the ground and many animations are glitched up from time, but everything is so fast paced and far you dont notice much.  Running on the Unity Engine the game is optimized and looks good enough, however not at all what i'd call "Next Gen" Rugby Challenge 2 crushes Rugby 15 graphically however it too had glitches in animation. Overall the gaphics of this dont truly hurt it at all. Graphics 7/10\n\nGameplay:This game seriously wanted to try something new, not only to rugby video games, but every sporting video game. You dont simply press a button to pass the ball, you must aim in the general area of the player you wish to pass it to then press RT. This mechanic sadly however causes many glitches in this game, such as the ball going through an opposing team player simply phasing through them. The game's engine is very,very easy on you as you can accidentally pass foward without any penalty, but this mechanic seriously allows this game to be ultra fluid allowing you to not have to hessitate before passing, but unreal god like passes can be made with hardly a chance to get a knock on.\n\nRucks: are great in this game however the player animations are practically non existent just squating and binding onto each other with no real pushing or struggle to speak of making rucks  looking awkward however this does not hinder the overall mechanic as unlike in Rugby Challenge 2 the time to win a ruck is more realistic and theres practically no time having to struggle sadly though this removes the tactical fun in planning out a proper ruck like in RC2.\n\nScrums:are a huge part in rugby and in this game well its not a timing game like in RC2, you seriously just push up and RT to hook the ball and if you feel like it you can just collapse the scrum for fun at the press of the button...yep because why not.\n\nLine Outs:in this game are simulated quite well, you have to prepare the jumper with LT then hold RT to lift them once again no timing like  in RC2 just 3 button presses and skill along with some luck as you do have some time to react to the other team's lineout movements.\n\nFending and overall evading:is quite fun since you do have to aim the right stick towards the opposing player and flick the right stick left or right to sidestep. With the right stick it feels similar to a less andvanced version of NBA 2k 15's Pro Stick.\n\nTrying: Is rather easy in this game due to the AI being a bit stupid, but giving a pretty great fight. To score a try enter the try zone and press the right stick.\n\nTackling:can be certainly easy in Rugby 15 as you just move to stick at the player with the ball to dive, otherwise just run into them and tackle them with your arms, less effective as they can fend, but you have a better change to hit them.\n\nConversions: are a great mini game where you pull the right stick back and push it foward however,accidentally rocking it left or right will screw up your kicking direction.\n\nReplays: dont exist at all and definently kill some of the fun, a good chunk and playing RC2 made me always expect a replay after every penalty is called or every try is made. Without them you feel rather cheated as you cant see where you messed up or that amazing move you made when you being a Right Wing fended that Prop Foward in the face. You just can't recap the game like that sadly. I feel this wasnt included due to the low quality graphics that HB didnt want you to see, but its fine making it feel even more realistic. Even though i rather had seen replays regardless of how bad the graphics are up close.\n\nClosing statement: Rugby 15 is a great fun arcady easy to pick and play Rugby Game where the right stick plays the biggest role and that is the fact that makes this a more enjoyable experience.Sadly however this doesnt feel as realistic as Rugby Challenge 2. I feel less intensity and less immersion when playing Rugby 15, but its certainly a game you can play with you friends(if you by chance do play local multiplayer on PC like me) Playing through a match is fun and something you will never stress about while in Rugby Challenge 2 it feels like there are true stakes as the All Blacks destroy everyone on that game while though tougher than most teams in Rugby 15 they are easily beaten. You just dont get the authentic rugby experience, but as it stands theres nothing wrong with this game(other than the lack of many Licenses to teams, but thats A-Okay! I rate this 7/10 for the price i paid, but for $40 i would say 5/10. Just buy this on sale.\n","June 17, 2015","true","18.4"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

I was looking forward to it but, my first impression so far is, it is missing a few elements of the rugby game at this stage.\n\nControls are not intuitive and/or unecessary complicated (goal kick could have been simpler by pressing a button instead of requiring to flick the directional pad).\nKick in the direction you are facing makes some actions impossible (run back and kick forward ?); passing too often go forward or worse in a totally random direction.\n\nThe game might just require a lot of practice but there is no training mode and one will probably be frustrated a lot before getting it. To me good gameplay should be simple, expertise coming with advanced moves and options, this is not it.\n\nThere is a tutorial that describes the commands (the game manual link on steam will take you to the same tutorial on the rugby 15 website), however it is only a series of screenshots that describe which buttons to use. Also some of the tutorial terms are just wrong: 'shoulder charge' is actually banned in rugby, use of 'miss pass' for cut out pass, or 'soccer' kick.\n\nRucking doesn't flow like a real game and an isolated player won't release the ball. Instead the game forces the ruck mode straight away even if only 2 or more vs 1. You will have to wait for more players to come in.\nCounter ruck and scrum make it too easy to get the ball from the opposition. There is no way to leave the ruck uncontested, it's almost like they made a mini game out of it.\n\nAdvantage last forever; even the opposition gains territory you will revert back to the original\n\nPlayer AI seems wrong and not natural e.g. player running passed the opposition, going offside, forward passes...\nTeam AI is rather basic, don't expect great tactical sense and positional play from your teammates.\n\nNot sure if the animation are not accurate or simply buggy, forward passes are not called.\n\nNot necessary a biggy but there is no ref on the field.\n\nMain menu layout is clear and simple, however you won't be able to customise gamepad settings. The game had no problem recognising my xbox wired controller.\nI like the option to switch the game perspective. It's nice to have; personnaly I prefer the 'side-on' view (left to right) rather than 'end-on' (top to bottom) as I feel it gives a more tactical view of the field (as well as being the usual tv angle).\n\nDifferent competitions are available:\n* Licenced: Aviva Premiership, Top 14, Pro D2 and Pro 12\n* Unlicenced (different name): 6 nations, Rugby Championship, super 15 (no team logo, called by their home town) and Heineken Cup\n* World cup: no but you can create a custom cup. There are 20 international teams to play with in friendly or custom.\n\nMultiplayer: none\n\nAs it stands I would not recommend. I'd suggest you wait and see if the game gets improved after a few patches. If this happens I would probably change my recommendation. By then I'll have a bit more practice and with some luck all the issues will have been fixed :D\n\n\nAs it stands I would not recommend. I'd suggest you wait and see if the game gets improved after a few patches. If this happens I would probably change my recommendation. By then I'll have a bit more practice and with some luck all the issues will have been fixed :D\n\nEdit 1 (22 Nov): given the low number of players I am giving a positive rating to encourage the developers. Even if my comments seems harsh they deserve some support for their 1st rugby game. I have faith a few fixes will make for a good game.\n\nEdit 2 (17 Dec): still no patch nor news from the developers since the release. At this stage I can't recommend a game that is broken and not supported :(","November 21, 2014","false","12.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

It is.\n\nPROS:\nOfficial Names for most european clubs and official names for their players.\nA small bit of potential for a massive re-develop of this game.\nSome nice implementations of kits and stadia.\nNice user interface.\n\nCONS:\n-No way to re-map your controls, so the game is stuck in the down right stupid controls that they have implemented.\n\nPassing (1/10): Left and right pass are the same button, and it depends on where you move the thumbstick (also run)... so basically you have to run in the direction you want to pass. When the player passes, they often glitch up and pass it the wrong direction for the animation, and the receiving player glides 10 metres up the pitch to receive the ball. Forward passes are also not a rule in the game, and though this often works to your advantage, it strongly affects the realism of this game which is very bad. All of this makes for a highly jumpy and disjointed flow of the game, actually no flow at all.\n\nRunning (5/10): This is /okay/, but theres no way to differentiate between jogging and sprinting as there is in most sports games. It's full speed or nothing.\n\nKicking (3/10): Place kicking is quite easy, and I actually like the thumbstick power controls for this, however all other aspects of kicking are horrendously buggy and hard to perfect. The ball often goes in the opposite direction to where you kicked it, just like the passing, and there is no marker or guideline of where the actual kick is headed, you have to gauge it by how much you've moved the stick, and even then it bugs up and totally goes in the opposite direction.\n\nRucks, Mauls, Scrums and Lineouts (5/10): This section of the game is /okay/ but it has serious bug problems yet again. The controls are very simple to use, and you win everything pretty much. I'd like more of a challenge, as rugby often is in this area of the game. However, when you go to pass from of the ruck or scrum, the ball more often than not goes in the opposite direction than you assigned.  Before the ruck comes the tackle, and the mechanics for tacking are buggy and inconsistent too. I've had a player just fall over, and a player on the other side of the screen do a tackling animation.\n\nOVERALL SUMMARY:\n\nWhere the devs could improve:\nMake the game more fluid with the passing and running, and implement 'run' and 'sprint' into the game.\nComplete overhaul of the passing and kicking mechanics.\nComplete re-think of the button mapping or better button customisability.\nAdd markers or guides to where kicks are headed and a nicer overall explanation to kicks in general.\nComplete overhaul of the tackling mechanics\n\nI sincerely hope the developers care enough about this game and its community enough to try to make a change with this game, and with their next, hopefully improved game, I think should be given to the community who bought this game for free or a reduced price. The trailer and the features they have listed give a very wrong impression of the game. I cannot help but pick out the piece thats starting me in the face saying 'Rugby 15 is the best rugby simulation ever made.' IT IS NOT IN THE SLIGHTEST. Rugby 2001 by EA sports was actually much better than this. The names of the players are incorrect in the International teams, which arguably is the style of rugby most players would like to play. Overall, this game seems very rushed indeed, and I would much rather have seen a very nice polished Rugby 16 with correct game mechanics and a nice user experience, rather than this lacklustre attempt at copying a 7 year old game which was, for the record, MUCH better.","December 29, 2014","false","10.2"," 65 of 71 people (92%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","92","65","71","6","0"

To me it's like they used fifa 06 player models. I expected better, I mean hb studios had something to do with madden right so why couldn't they give us better player models?  Only 2 camera views. Really? End on and side on with no zoom or other settings!! Not great.\n\nIn terms of gameplay the controls are fairly smooth and it does play well, certainly less button mashing than other rugby games of the past. Having only just started playing it is just an initial impression, I found it easy enough to do the basics at least.\n\nThe game lacks the customisation options I think. You can change players names and heights and positions but I can't seem to find where you can change their appearance, maybe I am missing something or team names either. Also the super 15 squads are completely different from the international squads so it is hard to know if you changed a player's name in super rugby, whether its the same player in an international team.\n\nSo far I am 50/50 on this game. It seems a little juvenile for an HD quality game (stuck at least 4-5 years ago in respect to  Graphics and models). Certainly with all the mods and customisation and player modelling RC2 seems to be the better game honestly, although the gameplay is actually quite good. If they could improve the player models then this game would be better.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rhyswh/recommended/303820/","rhyswh","Rhys","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rhyswh/","58 products in account","I feel robbed, honestly this game would be ok, and only ok if it was free. The fact they charge people for it is day light robbery! How can they get it so wrong, Rugby 08 is better than this in every aspect, even graphics! For a game that came out 7 years later it's embarassing to say the least.\n\nI wouldn't have bought it if EA would let me activate my Rugby 08 game (which I paid for, how is that fair EA!) but I was desperate for a rugby game. I'm gutted I missed the opportunity to buy Rugby Challenge 2.\n\nAnyway, back to this god awful game!\n\nPros: Conversions and Penalty kicks - I quite like the goal kicking, it's quite good.\n\nCons: Everything!\nWhere do I start!\nKicking: Like I said, goal kicking is good but every other type of kick in play is terrible! You have no idea where the ball is going so it's impossible to accurately kick for territory! The other thing is the only way you can clear your lines is to box kick. You will never have time to kick for touch without being tackled! Completely stupid!\n\nRucking: I quite like the controls for rucking, but it's way too easy. On hard I will turnover the ball in every single ruck! Needs to be harder. The other thing is it doesn't seem to make any difference if someone is isolated. You could be in a one man ruck against 3 oppostion players and still win the ball cleanly as long as you hold the right stick in the right place!\n\nMauls: Rubbish, useless! Once it's formed you hardly go anywhere and it's on a timer! So you just go through the motions.\n\nScrums: I like the controls but the hooking doesn't seem to do anything! The whole idea of hooking the ball back is to claim the ball for your team.But if the opposition push you back a yard or 2 you will loose the ball, even if you've already gone forward 5-6 yards!\n\nPassing: Terrible! The worst is passing out of rucks, mauls and scrums. When you pass the ball the recieving player doesn't move until he has caught it! So there is no momentum at all. As soon as the player catches it the defense is on you straight away. It makes a "quick ball" completely useless! The other frustrating thing is the overlap. There is no such thing in this game. For some reason if you do have the overlap, say 3 on 2, as soon as you pass out to the first man the other 2 run behind you and to the inside of you instead of staying on the wing! This means they run towards all the defensive players so you don't get the overlap! Completely stupid and frustrating.\n\nRunning: Again rubbish. All the moves (side step, handoff etc.) are done on the right stick, very simple controls, again I like. But the players have a mind of their own! They hardly ever do it when you ask them to and worst part is they sometimes do it when there's no one in front of them. A few times I've had people run through a gap only to stop dead trying to hand off thin air! As I mentioned earlier though the most frustrating thing ever is the standing still when catching the ball. No running onto the ball so no room to do anything.\n\nLineouts: Not great but it's ok\n\nWeather: I can't believe this one! It doesn't really affect gameplay but my god it shows how lazy they were when making this game. Before the game you can choose the time per half, difficutly, weather and wind speed. Great apart from you have to do it before every game as it doesn't remember your preferences (again pure lazyness!). The stupidest thing though is the weather, you can have it on Random which I leave it on or you can have rain.......and that's it! So if you really wanted a game in the glorious sunshine then you just have to select random and hope you get it, pure lazyness!\n\nReferee: Might as well not be on! The oppostition is offside a lot, usually stood right next to the scrumhalf by the ruck, as soon as he touches the ball he'll get tackled, the ref never calls it. Also forward passes never get called. Very annoying as it's usually when you want a quick ball the opposition is always off side which gives up your advantage!\n\nSeason: The biggest complaint about this is there are no transfers! It's very boring. There are no cut scene animations at all in this game. Not even replays! So everything just starts and ends abruptly! Makes it very dull.\n\nThere are probably loads more rubbish things that annoy me about this game but I even bored of writing about it now!\n\nIf this game was an early access I'd understand and I might even think you could be ok one day, but the fact this is the finished product is embarassing for the developers. They should be ashamed of charging people for this. I would even say the classic Jonah Lomu Rugby game on PS1 was better than this.....in fact it is better than this!\n\nSo as I'm sure you've realised I'm not a fan of this game.

More importantly - just like RWC 2011 - it's not fun.\n\nI'm torn between recommending this game so that the developers can consider patching it OR not recommending it because it seems like they didn't care in the first place.\n\nI've played almost every Rugby and Rugby League game, I buy them (on the consoles) in support of the games and hopefully that it will generate enough support to keep them going.\n\nI played this with the xbox 360 controller.\n\nLet's start on the Passing.\nThe ball physics operate, where the ball seems it's pumped with half oxygen and the other half helium.\nWhen passes are made - it's almost too easy to pick out where the ball will be received. Unfortunately, the collision detection (or player detection) is at stage where even if you are in a prime position to intercept (which is all the time) you still won't receive the ball.\nIt has a single pass button only. Whereas previously, it was a 2 button pass option (left button = pass left, right button = pass right). This is a horrible development because you lose the ability to direct players and have players run off the ruck.\n"Apparently" if you hold the pass button and release, the pass will skip the player next to the ball carrier - this happens occasionally. It's a lucky dip.\nYou can use a thumbstick to highlight the receiver and pass it to them, which is a good innovation but requires some fine tuning.\nThe games ability to judge forward passess has gone backwards from the previous itinerations. (i'm talking about Rugby 08 and RWC 11)\n\nThe Kicking.\nAll kicking in general play (grubber, chip and chase, punt and bomb) has a power indicator (which shows how much force you're using) BUT no directional indicator. This means you have to GUESS where your kick is going to go.\nWhen kicking to start play (22 Drop out, Kick restarts) you can move the player in the direction of where you want to kick, but it will only highlight the player (and move him in the direction) and not the direction of the kick.\n\nRucks\nThey've streamlined the ability to win the Rucks and simplified the process, however, they have moved away from one of the challenges of adding and removing players from the ruck. There is NO ability to add a player to ruck. Everything is done automaticly and then you are required to toggle your thumbstick to battle your opponent to win the ruck.\n\nThis mechanic is used again for Scrums and Mauls.\n\nI could go on - (especially about the A.I., Gameplay in general, Offensive and Defensive moves etc) - but most of it would be negative.\n\nThe positives are that the screens are clean. It's visually a pretty game. The money spent on something like Madden vs this make it a no contest. BUT for what it is - it's definitively a graphical improvement over the last few itinerations.\n\nTo be fair, I don't really care about the licensing, I don't care which teams feature - I believe that if a fun game is made, and has alot of depth in the gameplay itself - then everything else is a low priority.\n\nIn alot of ways, had this game been made in early 2000 - it would've been the greatest Rugby game ever.\n\nIt wasn't and it's not yet close to being a good rugby game.\n\nThis game has no depth, it's not fun to play by myself or even with others.\nMaybe some patching will fix some of the issues.\n\nIn writing this - I've decided to NOT recommend the game.","November 25, 2014","false","3.9"," 15 of 20 people (75%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","75","15","20","3","0"

The unfortunate nature of being both is that Rugby games aren't as diverse and popular as football, basketball or even Hockey games and very few shine through.

Glitches galore, overly simple gameplay, really awful graphics and no online features to speak of, there's very little to praise the game for and even then I'd be looking at minor things, then I'm reminded that players can implode and turn invisible during a match.

Stealing the ball is pretty easy and the only difference between the different difficultys is that you get more fouls for what you do, and the ai dont. So i play it on medium cause hard just get me frustrated. You got your ball out of the ruck and an ai player comes from behind you and tackles. You pass a ball backwards, try to kick it, get tackeld by ai player and get a foul. The ai kicks the penalty kick, you cache it and run into you next "foulplay". And so it goes the whole game. The sad thing is that playing on medium is just boring and way to easy.\n\nOn top of that the devs are last seen on steamforums somewere in November. I suspect that this game will not be updated and i cant recommend it.\n\n===================================================================\n\nOriginal review from the first week:\nI really like this game. The controlls are really good (I'm using a xBox 360 controller), no button-smashing like in other sport games. The sound is very good and makes a great atmosphere.\nThe graphics are okay, what points on the negative score is the lack of replays. Because of that the game becomes sometimes (especially at foul situations) very quick and confusing, just like real Rugby :D\nSometimes a player tackles the air but thats okay for me, overall the animations are not on top but good enough for me. Some people complain about the lack of an online mode, multiplayer would be nice for a sequell but its no dealbreaker for me. Sport games are best played as local multiplayer with a friend sitting on the same couch. But thats just my opinion.\n\nAs a summary i would say its a good game with potential upwards. The biggest pros are the great atmosphere and the controlls. If you not a next gen-graphics-fetishist you got a good solid rugby game here. And this type of game is unfortunately rare. I hope the devs sell enough copies to make a sequell.","November 21, 2014","false","8.9"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","5","8","0","0"

On big screen you can actually see details like players breathing. On regular screens you will have problems to see what's actually happening in the game. All these problems come from the game's static camera. You can only choose from left-right or up-bottom. The second choice is useles, because the camera spins every time ball changes possesion to make you lose your last meal. When it comes to feeling from watching the game when not playing it, there are more entertaining sports games from a decade ago.\nWhat do I like about Rugby 15 is the game flow and most of the controlls. Yeah, and the fact that it's a pc rugby game I've been waiting for some couple months.\nHowever, the bigger is the disappointment. It is impossible to properly aim drop goals and punts to gain territory. Players just kick the direction they're facing. And if an opponent runs towards them, they will stop kicking to lose the ball in a knock-on. Avoid hitting the control "A - release useless kick" especially after winning a ruck.\n\nI'm recommending this game to support it's designers in developing a patch to fix the issues. I'm okay with some player suddenly disappearing, but the camera and kicking has to be fixed. Get more budget and make a new release, please!

Compared to the other rugby games I have played (Rugby '08, Rugby World Cup 2011, and Jonah Lomu's Rugby Challenge), this gsmr is a bit different and has a learning curve for controls.  Is it a terrible Rugby game? Not in my opinion.  Not the best, but unplayable.\n\nMy analysis:\nPros:\n- It's a virtual rugby game, which there are few that have been made compared to the mainstream sports\n- Updated graphics, compared to the older rugby games\n- Plenty of teams (if not all) and tournament modes to choose\n- Decent GUI (easy to navigate)\n\n\nCons:\n- Glitchy. Passes sometimes goes right when you're passing left, sometimes they'll throw it WAY up in the air, players get caught on scrums / bunched up players / etc,\n- the AI for the opposing team and your inactive teammates is pretty bad.  They tend to stand there when te ball is lying on the ground, defeneders sometimes will back off when you're on the breakaway, will stand there and wait for ball to be passed to them, etc.\n- No group tackling.  While running straight at a group of defenders, only one will attempt to tackle, while the rest stand there dumbfounded and even back away.  This ties into bad AI and adds to the glithiness I mentioned above.\n- Kicking can be better.  On kickoffs, you can't choose the stength, arch, or distance of kick.  You face a direction and press a button...\n- No Multiplayer mode, at least not yet\n\n\nIn short, If you want this game, just buy this if/when it's on sale.  At least we can appreciate that there are people that are trying to make a new rugby game.","June 12, 2015","true","2.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The game itself reminds me of the old rugby games that EA Sports used to make, which is why they most likely why they tried to make the logo for the game look like it was made by a recent EA Group. Make no mistake, you play in the same Field, and the players for every team seem to have the same 20 player models. The announcers did a good job and can make you feel more inclined to play the game. The game itself feels like it is lacking a few big features for any sports games, such as different stadiums and a replay. The game just sorta cuts to the pause screen when you hit halftime and when the game ends. If they could add an instant replay the game would feel like a more complete game. There is no career mode, however you can setup custom tournaments but there is no multiple season game modes. The game is also SUPER GLITCHY. It can add to the fun when you watch players fall through the field and also watching players run in place. This however is a big problem when your player will be on a breakaway and then he will stop and then a player will glitch forward and tackle the player. The game itself runs really well, I run Windows 10 and have 8GB of ram and a non-gaming intel processor and I have been playing on the highest setting. The game does perform well for the $7 price tag that I picked it up for, but for 39.99 it is not worth picking up. Wait for it to go on sale or go to gamestop and look for a rugby game for the xbox 360. This is basically EA Sports Rugby games from back in 2005.

The graphics seem outdated and all of the players look alike.\n\nThe game claims to have real teams but you will find the international teams such as; England, Wallabies, Boks and All Blacks are not and just use the respective country's names and flags. As mentioned above the players for these teams are generic too. They all look the same size and ethnicity. This might be because the camera angle is quite high but in my opinion that takes away detail as players start to look like ants.\n\nThere seems to be some bugs in the game where players disappear. This happens most frequently after a maul. I contacted the developers last week about this to see if there was a patch but I have not heard back from them.\n\nWhile I respect the work it takes to make a game it doesn't reach my expectations considering the price and I probably should have done some research and watched some lets play videos to see what it was like but as it stands I am nonplussed with this game and looks like I'll be moving on. Too bad.\n\nIt's a 5/10\n","April 2, 2015","false","1.3"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

However, at its core, Rugby 15 is a FUN game. Sure it has its problems but if you can look past a few minor missing elements you will find a rugby game with loads of potential and hours of replayability. The game is not perfect by any means yet in some strange way, thats what makes it so unique and fun to play. Its unpredictable at times, the AI cannot be so easily figured out, as with many other Rugby games. There are plenty of licensed teams and competitions to choose from, though I would like to have seen at least one licensed competition from the southern hemisphere.\n\nI'm still hopeful that HB studios will fix a few minor problems in the coming months. Until then do yourself and the rugby loving gaming community a favour and pick this game up.","December 25, 2014","true","10.7"," 10 of 23 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","10","23","0","0"

It's very fast pace however feels unfinished.  A lack of quality in gameplay, as well as the graphics, really makes this game a sight for sore eyes.  However, the idea of the game is good and I hope there is plenty of updates in the future to fix th bugs in game.  Would of been nice if there was replays and a couple of different stadiums, looking at the same ground everytime really gets a bit boring.  Also the price is a rip off, def worth £15 but not £30... especially something which feels incompleted.\n\nWorth a go when reduced but I wouldn't buy it in this state at £30","November 23, 2014","false","4.7"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","3","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ragingrayshow/recommended/303820/","ragingrayshow","ShadowThingey","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ragingrayshow/","196 products in account","I bought this game when it was on Sale for $10.00/ €8.79. An excellent deal and thus i dont feel as bad after purchasing this for it's regular $40.00/  €35.17. The review will begin now.\n\nI have not played too much,  but i have played more than enough to give a good opinion and i have seen the most positive and most negative aspects of this game.\n\nFirst off what you see,\nGraphics:\nBeing far from the pitch you cant see much detail even if you tried and due to not bieng any camera angles that bring you that close everything looks quite crisp and smooth. Sadly however the crowd is obviosuly nothing but pixelated flat sprites, but the game helps it self by adding a fake depth of field effect over them so they are much less atrocious to view.\nThe lighting effects are rather good and allow good color to pop through, there is nothing special or fancy about this game; no HBAO or SSAO not even actual blades of grass protruding from the ground and many animations are glitched up from time, but everything is so fast paced and far you dont notice much.  Running on the Unity Engine the game is optimized and looks good enough, however not at all what i'd call "Next Gen" Rugby Challenge 2 crushes Rugby 15 graphically however it too had glitches in animation. Overall the gaphics of this dont truly hurt it at all. Graphics 7/10\n\nGameplay:This game seriously wanted to try something new, not only to rugby video games, but every sporting video game. You dont simply press a button to pass the ball, you must aim in the general area of the player you wish to pass it to then press RT. This mechanic sadly however causes many glitches in this game, such as the ball going through an opposing team player simply phasing through them. The game's engine is very,very easy on you as you can accidentally pass foward without any penalty, but this mechanic seriously allows this game to be ultra fluid allowing you to not have to hessitate before passing, but unreal god like passes can be made with hardly a chance to get a knock on.\n\nRucks: are great in this game however the player animations are practically non existent just squating and binding onto each other with no real pushing or struggle to speak of making rucks  looking awkward however this does not hinder the overall mechanic as unlike in Rugby Challenge 2 the time to win a ruck is more realistic and theres practically no time having to struggle sadly though this removes the tactical fun in planning out a proper ruck like in RC2.\n\nScrums:are a huge part in rugby and in this game well its not a timing game like in RC2, you seriously just push up and RT to hook the ball and if you feel like it you can just collapse the scrum for fun at the press of the button...yep because why not.\n\nLine Outs:in this game are simulated quite well, you have to prepare the jumper with LT then hold RT to lift them once again no timing like  in RC2 just 3 button presses and skill along with some luck as you do have some time to react to the other team's lineout movements.\n\nFending and overall evading:is quite fun since you do have to aim the right stick towards the opposing player and flick the right stick left or right to sidestep. With the right stick it feels similar to a less andvanced version of NBA 2k 15's Pro Stick.\n\nTrying: Is rather easy in this game due to the AI being a bit stupid, but giving a pretty great fight. To score a try enter the try zone and press the right stick.\n\nTackling:can be certainly easy in Rugby 15 as you just move to stick at the player with the ball to dive, otherwise just run into them and tackle them with your arms, less effective as they can fend, but you have a better change to hit them.\n\nConversions: are a great mini game where you pull the right stick back and push it foward however,accidentally rocking it left or right will screw up your kicking direction.\n\nReplays: dont exist at all and definently kill some of the fun, a good chunk and playing RC2 made me always expect a replay after every penalty is called or every try is made. Without them you feel rather cheated as you cant see where you messed up or that amazing move you made when you being a Right Wing fended that Prop Foward in the face. You just can't recap the game like that sadly. I feel this wasnt included due to the low quality graphics that HB didnt want you to see, but its fine making it feel even more realistic. Even though i rather had seen replays regardless of how bad the graphics are up close.\n\nClosing statement: Rugby 15 is a great fun arcady easy to pick and play Rugby Game where the right stick plays the biggest role and that is the fact that makes this a more enjoyable experience.Sadly however this doesnt feel as realistic as Rugby Challenge 2. I feel less intensity and less immersion when playing Rugby 15, but its certainly a game you can play with you friends(if you by chance do play local multiplayer on PC like me) Playing through a match is fun and something you will never stress about while in Rugby Challenge 2 it feels like there are true stakes as the All Blacks destroy everyone on that game while though tougher than most teams in Rugby 15 they are easily beaten. You just dont get the authentic rugby experience, but as it stands theres nothing wrong with this game(other than the lack of many Licenses to teams, but thats A-Okay! I rate this 7/10 for the price i paid, but for $40 i would say 5/10. Just buy this on sale.\n","June 17, 2015","true","18.4"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

I was looking forward to it but, my first impression so far is, it is missing a few elements of the rugby game at this stage.\n\nControls are not intuitive and/or unecessary complicated (goal kick could have been simpler by pressing a button instead of requiring to flick the directional pad).\nKick in the direction you are facing makes some actions impossible (run back and kick forward ?); passing too often go forward or worse in a totally random direction.\n\nThe game might just require a lot of practice but there is no training mode and one will probably be frustrated a lot before getting it. To me good gameplay should be simple, expertise coming with advanced moves and options, this is not it.\n\nThere is a tutorial that describes the commands (the game manual link on steam will take you to the same tutorial on the rugby 15 website), however it is only a series of screenshots that describe which buttons to use. Also some of the tutorial terms are just wrong: 'shoulder charge' is actually banned in rugby, use of 'miss pass' for cut out pass, or 'soccer' kick.\n\nRucking doesn't flow like a real game and an isolated player won't release the ball. Instead the game forces the ruck mode straight away even if only 2 or more vs 1. You will have to wait for more players to come in.\nCounter ruck and scrum make it too easy to get the ball from the opposition. There is no way to leave the ruck uncontested, it's almost like they made a mini game out of it.\n\nAdvantage last forever; even the opposition gains territory you will revert back to the original\n\nPlayer AI seems wrong and not natural e.g. player running passed the opposition, going offside, forward passes...\nTeam AI is rather basic, don't expect great tactical sense and positional play from your teammates.\n\nNot sure if the animation are not accurate or simply buggy, forward passes are not called.\n\nNot necessary a biggy but there is no ref on the field.\n\nMain menu layout is clear and simple, however you won't be able to customise gamepad settings. The game had no problem recognising my xbox wired controller.\nI like the option to switch the game perspective. It's nice to have; personnaly I prefer the 'side-on' view (left to right) rather than 'end-on' (top to bottom) as I feel it gives a more tactical view of the field (as well as being the usual tv angle).\n\nDifferent competitions are available:\n* Licenced: Aviva Premiership, Top 14, Pro D2 and Pro 12\n* Unlicenced (different name): 6 nations, Rugby Championship, super 15 (no team logo, called by their home town) and Heineken Cup\n* World cup: no but you can create a custom cup. There are 20 international teams to play with in friendly or custom.\n\nMultiplayer: none\n\nAs it stands I would not recommend. I'd suggest you wait and see if the game gets improved after a few patches. If this happens I would probably change my recommendation. By then I'll have a bit more practice and with some luck all the issues will have been fixed :D\n\n\nAs it stands I would not recommend. I'd suggest you wait and see if the game gets improved after a few patches. If this happens I would probably change my recommendation. By then I'll have a bit more practice and with some luck all the issues will have been fixed :D\n\nEdit 1 (22 Nov): given the low number of players I am giving a positive rating to encourage the developers. Even if my comments seems harsh they deserve some support for their 1st rugby game. I have faith a few fixes will make for a good game.\n\nEdit 2 (17 Dec): still no patch nor news from the developers since the release. At this stage I can't recommend a game that is broken and not supported :(","November 21, 2014","false","12.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"
