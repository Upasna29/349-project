While I now say I can fully take the time to enjoy this game, the bussiness practices I still really don't like. It gives the vibes of a mobile game, while most all things you can unlock in game. Silver Coins you earn in game by doing weekly missions or wallet. There are some artistic discrepencies that still bug me a wee bit. However keep an eye on this title, especially for the upcoming fall sale or winter sale. While I do not recommend this title at full price if you want to get a good deal to get all the content for probably less. Unfortunately like Rome 2 this will be a black stain, hopefully we will see an Emperor Edition like update that may change hearts and minds. I want Signal Studios and Ubisoft to succeed, I like their games. I just really dislike some of there bussiness policies.\n\n30 Minutes or Less - Redemption\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtBI9Rq1t7M&list=PLNtPp4M-LVW8Lz7Uc9s4R1gsLRC_4R6NZ&index=1\n\n***EDITED BELOW (and then edited again do to some revelations en such)***\n\nWith a 30 FPS Lock currently I am already really annoyed, chopping the game up with over five pieces of Day one DLC that should have been included I am Angry. Than throwing in the U-Play launcher and to put a nice cherry on top Overflowing with MICROTRANSACTIONS! The game play fine and has good new mechanics that I should be salavating over but these major problems all of which reek of a quick cash grab are extremely disgusting. I am going to play your game Signal Studios but I want you to know you guys made some pretty big mistakes, stuff I would have hoped you my innocent little Indie would never have done.\n\n30 Minutes or Less... Yeah T'was most upsetting as all the pieces of the puzzle came together..\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6ZLOVaq1gI&list=PLNtPp4M-LVW-RJYbhJha2iqZ7wSZOZI5H&index=1\n\n***EDIT***\nOLD STUFF SCROLL ON!\nThe developer actaully took the time to watch my rant on his game and respond in a very well mannered and polite tone. They are looking into resolving this issue with the FPS which gives me hope and comfort knowing they care. I am going to give this a few weeks and Re- Review this game.  Good Job Logan someone give that man a Raise! (Though if he is the top honcho well buy him dinner or something)\n\nEdit again..\n\nYour better off avoiding this game all together! IT IS NOT WORHT YOUR TIME AT ALL, two hours in the gameplay stagnated (arguebly sooner) It is overpriced and I have heard things that this was intended for Mobiles?!? I DON'T WANT PORT JOBS ANYMORE! They always turn out halfbaked and a waste of my time and money. (as well as everyone else in the world.) *Sigh* I just want a game that is fun, packed with content. Not boring overpriced and chopped up into little pieces and ♥♥♥♥ at me like DLC. Whatever happened to REAL EXPANSIONS?!?! With loads of Content, and replayability! I refuse to purchase anymore UBISOFT GAMES PERIOD. Signal Studios if you signed on with them permanately..

First off i am a huge fan of signal games, but like all hard-core toy soldiers fans, we saw the decline of customer loyalty starting with toy soldiers: complete. Toy soldiers: complete was a god aweful port from last gen consoles, bugged to hell, and was "protected" by the early access seal. By the time it was released on pc, all of the fans starting to buy big red ♥♥♥♥ing whistles because we knew something as wretched as this would be spewed from the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of capitalist hell itself. As for this "game", its a piece of trash. It might as well be a MOBILE GAME. The first thing that stood out when i booted up the menu was that there was A SHOP! No complete, well made game ever in the history of man has had a ♥♥♥♥ing in menu shop where you can buy coins to unlock units and weapons for your army, that should have been unlocked in the first place or at least, by completing the campaign. Yet again, like mobile games. Instead of unlocking items by skill, you are subjected to a slot machine that randomly gives you upgrades etc. Or you can pay $5 to unlock the units and upgrades yourself. The textues on high, looks like they are from 2007.The gameplay itself is fun and engaging. Although, besides all the bad ♥♥♥♥ that is included in this grotesque, morsel of a game.   You ready? Dun dun dunnnn,,, The game is locked to 30fps! Jesus christ on a bicycle! Its borderline unplayable! Its only playable if you like to watch slidshows of the game you are playing.\n\nSo overall, this game is a piece of digital garbage and is not worth your time of money in its current state. Not to demoralize you guys but signal doesnt like to patch or fix their games. *cough* *cough* Toy Soldiers complete. *cough*\n\nClash of clans/10-IGN","August 12, 2015","false","1.1"," 328 of 413 people (79%) found this review helpful 28 people found this review funny","79","328","413","28","7"

I played the last two titles extensively. Now, hearing about a sequel to two of my favorite games with Assasin's Creed and G.I. Joe? I was pumped. Like, puking rainbows pumped.\n\nThen, I bought the game.\n\nIt came a full day after the promised release date, was twice the price of the base game to buy a third of the game's total content, and immediately required me to install Uplay. These issues were hard to overlook, but I managed. After they'd dropped the ball out of the gate, Ubisoft threw Microtransactions at me. On a $30 game. The game has a 12 mission story, compared to it's predeccesors which both at least doubled that for 2/3 the price. The armies are just shy of retextures, and content for the game was unnervingly hard to find. I've requested a refund, despite my computer being left on for a day (mind you, I've spent maybe an hour and a half tops,) and I desperately hope I get it.

This is one of those odd cases where in the future, it will seem like the newer game was actually older then the older game. Gone is a lot of the whimsical charm that Complete has, or the excitement of the bonuses, or the finding lost objects, or... well... you get it. Basically, some people re-made the original and thought they could do better.. but ended up doing worse.\nAfter playing Complete.. and then this.. your constantly thinking, this is worse but ok. But after awhile.. the worseness wears on you.. and you start getting bitter.. and your like.. DID THEY EVEN PLAY THE OLD GAME!? I loved the bonuses, the set pieces, spending all night finding hidden objects and the... well, I guess you didn't? I dunno.. it's like making the Wizard Of Oz part 2.. but skipping the musical part and the witches and the whole technicolor thing. You'd be like, WTF did they like about the original to then even bother making Part 2? This feels like that. Skip unless you loved Complete so much.. you want to marry it.

Joe in. I'm still waiting, it's a buggy tedious piece of crap that is fugly as hell.\n\nEven though it took me 3 attempts at loading it to get to the main menu, freezes on the character select screen whilst it checks the uplay servers to see what characters you have brought, I can forgive that ♥♥♥♥ if it is fun but it isn't any more fun than any one of the countless free games out there.    Waves are long, numerous and repetitive even for a tower defence game, and the DLC armies which are the only reason to want this game, don't improve it enough.  There are hundreds of characters they could have used to man different placements but instead you spend most of your time controlling the greenshirts/cobra troopers in turrets/bunkers shooting the enemy canon fodder to unlock your special character which is the only reason you want to play the game.\n\nMaybe there's unlocks to speed it up as you play, I don't know, there is something super disappointing about this game, and I don't just mean the 30fps, sluggish mouse controls (use a joypad) and micro transactions.\n\nJust ignore the licences, it isn't a particularly good game anyway and is a waste of the G.I. Joe, Cobra & MOTU brands and those brands are why I was probably hoping for more.  I expect a lot of people will play it and be perfectly happy but I don't feel it does them justice and certainly doesn't do the price justice.\n\nIn a few months when it is patched and on sale it could be a lot closer to a recommendation but for now I couldn't be bothered to try multiplayer as you only get a limited time to get a refund and that is exactly what I have done.

If you are a fan of the last few toy soldiers you will love this one.\nEvery army is simmilar enough that its not a challange to pick up another one off the bat but they all have a flavor that makes them worth playing and experamenting with (armys have different powers, strangths ect...)\n\nNow for the bad:\nKill Uplay. For god sakes If I wanted to buy the game on Uplay I would. DRM protection is a joke, This game was up on the torrents within the first day of launch. All Uplay has done is create another problem for your normal buyer. Dump the platform.\n\nForceing me to pay for DLC that is in game is horse ♥♥♥♥. Day one 15 bucks worth of DLC is bull. I understand you need to make up for the licences (He man, GI Joe...). But passing that on to the buyer is poor practice in todays buissness. Make up some other armys, you can do it...\n\n*The game is not locked at 30 FPS anymore, it is now set to 60 after recent patch.\n\nWhen you make a port to PC, you dont get to just shove it in laughing to the bank. Make sure it works. Look at the system EA had going. Bad company practice WILL lead to lower profits and hire piracy rates. Respect your buyer and they will respect you.\n\nI never had a problem with GFX. Everything looked fine for me and my FPS was fne, but thats just me. Im sure others are not as lucky.\n\n\nSome myths:\nSome are saying that this game has micro transactions. The in game method of unlocking tower upgrades is threw an in game coinage. You beat levels and you get coins. Every time you win a level (or loss) you get free stuff and coins.\nYou can pay to get coins but this is stupid. After I played the campain once I had all but one army fully unlocked without spending a cent in the micro store..In fact I did not know you could pay to get coins untill I found it on accident. Its Simply a way for the lazy asses to get ahead.\nDont spend a cent on the ingame micro, Its exactly like the past games if you dont.\n\nOver all its a solid game. Not a work of art or ground brakeing but its still a solid game. If you love the past games, buy it. If you are unsure wait for it to be on sale.

Biggest disappointment is when you get upgrades" when your main character gains levels (not even sure levels do  anything outside of getting a "box" with 3 upgrades that are always duplicates). If you get a repeat upgrade - it turns into coins that you will already have too many of.\n\nGame just gets very stale very fast.  Very limited turrets / weapons choices.  Taking over your character is also limited. First you have to kill a lot of enemies consecutively to build a "bar" to allow you to release your commander.  But it's limited since it has to have "battery power". 90 or 60 seconds total.  The batteries(to gain additional time) are found on the field  to extend the "play time". These do not respawn and the levels where you can get high number of consecutive kills is limited.\n\nThere is a customize army option that I assume is multiplayer only. If you are just looking for a towerdefense singleplayer - seems a lot of features may be useless.","August 22, 2015","false","21.9"," 21 of 26 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","21","26","0","1"

I have almost 4 hours on this game at the time of reviewing so already I feel that I am in a better position to review this game than people who have 0.5 hours in it and such.\n\nFirst I downloaded. I was expecting Uplay but it hadn't been installed since my latest format, so I sat there for the better part of 30 minutes while it installed. Once it did I tried to login. It had been a while so I sat there thinking of the passwords I normally use but none were correct. I was then locked out of Uplay because I had tried to login too much. Not being given an option to do anything about it, and the password reset not working at all, I went onto the website to try to send a support ticket and guess what? That's right, I couldn't access the site because I was locked out. ♥♥♥♥ing hilarious right? In the end I had to call, yes, call Ubisoft and ask them to do something. The guy was helpful despite me remarking about how terrible Uplay is, he even said "We get a lot of complaints about Uplay." He couldn't insult the company that employed him of course, nor would I expect him to, but it was funny none the less.\n"Can I help you with anything else today?" He asked. "Yes, please tell your bosses that Uplay is a pile of ♥♥♥♥ and to please stop making us use it." I laughed, he laughed and in a diplomatic tone said "I will certainly pass that information over for you sir."\n\nI digress. The game! So first impressions; what a crappy port! The resolution works fine of course but the menu feels quite akward, almost as if the game just had mouse support slapped in with a bit of digital tape. Still, it's not horrendous.\n\nI watched a Let's play video earlier of a guy reviewing it and he hit the roof when he saw the shop with microtransactions. Erm, mate? You can grind that money and it's really effin easy too. So scratch that as a con off of your list if you are thinking about this game. Microtransactions are purely for impatient/lazy people. They are not necessary!\n\nThe framerate. Yes most people have an opinion of how choppy it feels being locked at 30fps. Well I didn't, it felt fine to me even on full graphics. I'm not going to say that people who are going on about that are snobs or anything, but it's no where near as jumpy as they make out. If it is, I would maybe suggest that it's their rigs...maybe lacking in ram or up to date drivers, I don't know. Update: Been playing for 11 hours now so far and not had a single problem with framerate. Just a bunch of snobs complaining about something which isn't even noticable then.\n\nI do have a couple of problems with the performance though: you can't alt+tab. Well you can, but if you do, the resolution will reset to default (1280x768 iirc). In this day and age, inexcusable. Also when I was doing the tutorial I was given these TINY icons on the screen telling me what key to press; so tiny that I couldn't see what it said. I'm assuming this is because the resolution was never meant to go that high on consoles and they just didn't bother to make the icons bigger to compensate... but otherwise the resolution is fine.\n\nSo the gameplay. It's a tower defence game with toys. It's actually a lot of fun. The graphics are a little dated looking and the controls quite basic, but that's by no means a horrible thing. The gameplay is alot of fun. You can unlock upgrades and each army feels quite unique if not in it's options but in it's feel. Campaign seems only good if you want to unlock stuff but gets quite annoying later on. The weekly thing seems quite fun. I want to try co-op when I convince my friends to get it, but for now my experience is in single player.\n\nThe controls are fine for the most part, but now and again you are given control of a map defined flying unit.... the controls are screwed for those and that needs to be fixed asap.\n\nIt's a good game, despite it's shortcomings. I have read a post from a developer on another review saying how they are looking into the framerate cap, so they at least haven't given up on it. A few fixes here and there and it will be great. It's really up to you if you want to pay 25 pounds (or $30, whichever currency you use) for everything; You only really get half a game if you get the vanilla and not the hall of fame edition. It's really cheeky of them to do that but I still think this game is worth that price: providing they add some general fixes to make the game more PC friendly. The only real gripe is with Uplay. I hate it, it doesn't work well, slow, and it's just more unnecessary processing power with everything else I'm running","August 13, 2015","true","22.7"," 43 of 71 people (61%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","61","43","71","4","2"

I love the maps, lots of foliage and open terrain, with beautifully designed structures. The eight armies all have something different and unique to offer, the game IMO is a good complement to owners of Toy Soldiers Complete, love the new look and design. I have this game for PS4 and PC, PS4 is more colorful and cartoonish to a degree than the PC version, though on a good rig, PC looks more intricate and detailed, it's a preference thing, some will like one version over the other. The graphics and unit designs in this game are infinitely better than previous offerings of Toy Soldiers games, by far, this is the best looking game in the series to date. Sound effects on headphones is great, and when playing on my Logitech Z-5500s, some of the anti-personnel weapons should be more defined and powerful sounding, though they still sound great.\n\nThe progression map and unlock of unique units and traits is a great approach, you can pick a faction and level it up throughout an open progression campaign map, nice touch. Overall, I highly recommend this game, seeing the Joes, He-Man and others battle it out on beautifully designed maps and levels is a joyous sight to be had. Hope to see more content added to this game in the future, want more of it, it's that good!\n\nI've played mostly on console, just picked up the PC version, playing on an i7-920 stock, Gigabyte G1 970 at 2560x1440 all video card settings and in game maxed with zero issues so far, Windows 10 OS. Of note, some of the troops on the turrets do odd things I've noticed, I'm mostly using Phantom and I noticed some of the individual troops on your turrets are not even firing at the enemy, they are just randomly firing off into nowhere, a little disconcerting, more of an immersion breaker, than anything else. Another thing, the difficulty spikes up tremendously at times, especially with bosses, so be prepared.","December 25, 2015","true","12.2"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","12","15","0","2"

It's almost as though Signal made it functional, then Ubisoft took it off them and went "Good enough!!".\n\nIt essentially plays the same as the preceding instalments, with some good ideas and bigger scope, but there's just so many elements out of whack.  Games modes flat out don't work, conspicuously missing turrets, no difficulty settings (defaulting to 'easy mode'), plus you get all the most powerful turrets from the get go, and have almost all upgrades unlocked after a few levels.  The only challenge seems to some from endlessly completing the game with each army, which would be an absolute drudge.  Ironically the last 2 levels border on interesting.  It's a shame the rest of them require little to no tactics.\n\nBarring the game design choices, even the basic functionality seems to be unpolished. The game freezes, enemies refuse to die or fly through the air, and it goes into a distorted windowed mode every time you tab out.  I really hope whatever deal they struck with Ubisoft doesn't mean they have to publish ALL of their future games through them.

They were very close to perfect and the second one was a clear step forward for the series. Toy Soldier War Chest falls shorter than either of those games to perfection and I feel it doesn’t grow the series at all.\n\nGeneral Thoughts:\nWar Chest is a lot of fun it uses the formula that the other two games built but does do all that much different from the other two games. The hero mechanic has been expanded where you have a kill-streak like bar. As you get more kills in the turret that you’re using the bar will go up unlocking hero, vehicle, and then super weapon for you to use. Each race has unique turrets animations, models and has some slight differences in rate of fire and range. Heroes have unique and fun weapons but the dlc heroes don’t have as many as the base game heroes when it comes to weapons. Heroes also can’t jump this is a flaw and really should have been added. Other than those features the game plays the same as the other to titles in the franchise. It has weekly invasions(challenges) which are fun and will expand the gameplay slightly.\n\nThe Bad:\nHaving a sequel that doesn’t grow the franchise isn’t always bad if they improve what’s there. War Chest doesn’t, it plays like the other two but now heroes are harder to control. It’s annoying but not 100% bad when it comes to the hero’s controls although I would highly recommend a controller. The other two toy soldier’s games had a unique fun war theme with them. War Chest is fun but that war theme is no longer there really, so if you wanted that feeling you won’t find it here. There is a in game shop. This does have micro transactions, but you can unlock anything with coins you will earn in the game. You get the coins fairly and I feel they added just of those that are impatience with getting unlocks.\n\nThe Good:\nIt plays as well as the other two games(excluding heroes) with fun level design that will give you a challenge. It’s a fun game and you’re looking for a good tower defense game with some third-person components you will find it here. The upgrading for turrents have been sighlty improved now you can upgrade different parts individually. (range,damage,armor)\n\nThe Meh:\n\nUplay, it’s here, it isn’t as bad as I thought it would be. It took only about 5 minutes to set up and I have had no problem with it when in game. It does take a couple extra minutes for the game to start though. The menu is bare bones its only what you really need and not much else.\n\nFinal thoughts:\nEven with its flaws it’s a fun and good game in the series. I would recommend it to you on sale. If you like tower defense games and need something to scratch that itch this will do it for you.","February 8","true","6.9"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","6","10","0","0"

After 15 minutes of setting up a Uplay account, I was ready to get started on this game, And it crashed and wouldn't work what so ever. then i finally got working, I went to play the tutorial, but the frame rate is complete ♥♥♥♥, and my mouse sensitivity was out of the ♥♥♥♥ing roof.  The different armies are not enough to spend an additional 15$, they make any difference.  The turrets are reused and retextured to make them look different but same sounds and damage as older models, and when you go to shoot the turret itself the mouse sensitivity makes it nearly impossible to even shoot at the target.

As it stands, THE DLC AND HALL OF FAME EDITION ARE COMPLETELY A WASTE OF MONEY BECAUSE YOU CANNOT USE ANY OF THAT CONTENT IN GAME until such time Ubisoft decides to fix it.\n\ntldr: Poor controls, Bad port, and the DLC is currently a scam.

I actually got so bored on some missions i would look at the wave counter, noticing I have spent 10 minutes and I am only on wave 5 out of 20 then say "♥♥♥♥ it" then quit the game.\n\nIn closing I would like to say, Signal studios please find another publisher this game is complete ♥♥♥♥ compared to the previous entries; i also want you to go back to your roots play the previos games and think "why is his better than war chest?" then make a new game free of charge to those who bought War Chest .\nIf I were new to this series I would give it a 7/10\nbut as I have played the others i give it a 2/10","August 18, 2015","false","14.8"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

I found myself stuck on the 1st bootup for approximately 15 mins and my rig isn't a slow one. After the first time bootup has finished it gives you the option to launch the tutorial and I reccomend to do so. It will take a long time to load that as well for the 1st time it took me approximately 10 mins.\n\nAfter all is said and done with the horrific 1st time boot up of the game it runs fine and now when you run it or start up it is standard load times. I avg 15-30 sec for my load times.\n\nThis product is not broken and have to be patient with the 1st time you load it up on your system.","May 9","true","3.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The amount of coins you get from doing content more than pay for the things you want to buy, getting coins from the store is IMO a total waste.

There are some bugs and things to iron out, but I don't regret my purchase one bit.\n\nA lot of lemmings are throwing around a bunch of entitled gamer cliches to disparage the game, but let's look at the complaints:\n\n30fps lock.\n\nSo what? This isn't CS or some other twitch shooter. The game looks good and plays smoothly.\n\nDay 1 DLC.\n\nLook, I think there is something wrong with forcing people to pay for a map or weapon pack Day 1. That stuff should be packaged in with the base game. But that's not really what's going on here. They released a very cheap game ($15) and are simply asking you to pay a little extra money if you want to play licensed IPs such as GI-JOE and He-Man. Being able to play with classic IPs is one of the main attractions of the game, and you can't do that without paying for the IPs. That costs money, which has to come from somewhere. Either play the base game with in-house IPs or pony up and pay an extra $15–not an exorbitant price at all–to play with licensed IPs. Seems fair.\n\nMicrotransactions.\n\nI haven't found anything in the game that can't be purchased with tokens that you gain by simply playing the game. The game isn't P2W; it just gives you an option to save time by purchasing rather than farming tokens. You're not forced into microtransactions, and microtransactions allow the game to be released at a lower price point. It's a win-win: People can pay money to accelerate token accrual and people who don't purchase tokens benefit from a cheaper game.\nTL;DR: The game is fun, and people are getting their panties in a bunch for no reason.","August 13, 2015","true","10.3"," 34 of 77 people (44%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","44","34","77","6","1"

Sure, there are a few things that can be worked on, but so far I have only had fun.\nI have absolutely no problems with the FPS, and I have a stock Lenovo Ideapad Z710, no uprgrades or anything special about it. I had one slow down to like 5 FPS, but the game runs smoothly for me.\nIt's also just a lot of fun. Sure, day one DLC is total BS, but the game is still fun and the in-game currency is not hard to earn. You can get like... 5000 just from doing the first four missions, and you can get anything you want with 2000 coins, so I don't understand anyone's complaints about it being "unplayable."\nI have thoroughly enjoyed my time playing this game, and I haven't played the others so I have nothing to compare it to, but I think this is very fun.\nThe only issues I've actually had are the UPlay launcher, which is just annoying, the UI is incredibly small and I at least haven't figured out how to increase the size, but It's kinda guess/check for which buttons to press to control movement of a character/turret, at least for me. The only other problem I've actually had is that flying is absolutely awful, and the mouse seems too sensitive on any setting above .25.\nWhat's good about it are pretty much everything else. It's easy to learn, and mostly intuitive. The multiplayer is actually very fun, if you can find someone else playing the game. What else are you even looking for in a tower defense game?\n\nIn any case, I would definitely reccomend the game.

You generally get all of the upgrades by the end of the campaign by either unlocking them by leveling up however, it is randomised meaning you can get 2 of a kind but this problem is solved with silver which is the stuff you get after EVERY MISSION, atleast a 1000 each time i'd say which is more than enough, along with stored silver, to buy the cheap upgrades. Maybe if your just in it for the multiplayer and not the progression than the microtransactions would be used but they really are a non issue.\n\nNow to my list of pros,cons,and mehs\n\nPros Good Gameplay with good animations\n\nVery good multiplayer\n\nGood Survival\n\nUpgrading system that allows you to invest more in turrets than before\n\nUnique hero characters with strengths and weaknesses\n\n4 armies(8 with the dlc) that are all unique and all have different strengths\n\nGreat graphics\n\nLots of variety in the main armies(not dlc ones)\n\nMeh\nUplay which has gotten better with age but it still isn't easy to swallow\nMicrotransactions in game\n\nCons\nLONG LOADING TIMES especially for multiplayer\n\nDLC with DAY 1 DLC and future dlc's coming up which I found (including many other people) in the files, stuff like power rangers,war of the worlds,and the armies from the previous games.\n\nFramrate drops usually just as a wave is launching which can be annoying for the few seconds they last\n\nLack of Variety in the dlc armies mainly with the heroes.\n\nPoor pc controls/UI\n\nno options for in-gamechat like volume and stuff\n\nLack of care, it is obvious the pc version was just an after thought and that way less care, in the future, will be into this version rather than the consoles which is a shame.\n\nIn Conclusion\nI reccommend this game to evryone who is a fan of tower defense games and has a few friends who they can play with, hopefully the game will be better in the future but right now it is money well spent.","August 14, 2015","true","21.2"," 2 of 12 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","2","12","0","1"

The 4-5 things i lack i can easily buy with silver tokens i have earned in-game.

If you liked the slight humor and fun of the original Toy Soldiers and Cold War then this will be right up your alley. You defend your toybox using the hero and Army of your choice which can be customized as you unlock more and more stuff from the campaign by murdering the 'evil' everyone else forces. There is actually a crap ton of unlockable stuff like gas shells, barrage balloons and freaking Unicorns that fire laser beams out of their heads. Unfortunately, there are a couple of port issues that should've been fixed by the devs such as 30 FPS lock (caaaam on), button layouts for Xbox Controls and text resolutions so small that some keyboard controls are impossible to read. I also notice that sometimes the controls can be awkward and flying is ungodly sensitive... thankfully you can adjust that in the menu. Also, 20-25 bucks of DLC on release day? Caaaaam on! All in all, I suggest the base game, it's fun and it's more Toy Soldiers. Hopefully, they will iron out the port issues soon.\nGameplay Footage:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yl6T33N-ImA","August 12, 2015","true","5.7"," 80 of 188 people (43%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","43","80","188","11","3"

You build in limited places, upgrade and control the towers at your pleasure.\n\nSo how does this compare to the previous Toy Soldiers...\n1. Obvious one here. Instead of just 'realistic' toy soldiers you do battle with different toy sets. One of the charms of the first game for me was the existential battle of fighting another army in a child like, mass destruction/killing for fun sort of way. With the fantasy elements obviously that dynamic is a little different.\n\n2. Unlike the first game where you progress through stages to unlock upgrades for the overall towers, here you unlock different indivdual tower elements (range,power, etc) for the towerswith coins or random drops at the end of the level. This means a lot of grinding which was present in the previous games as well. But now with 7 or whatever sets of characters, that's a lot of playing maps over and over. And again although they are asthetically very different, as of now I don't see much variation in the actual functionality of the towers.\n\n3. Every time you level up your different toy sets, you recieve these things that look like pogs. They are the individual upgrades for the turrets. You can also purchase boxes of the random upgrades as well.\n\n3. There is a new weekly challenge mode. That's cool and helps with the grinding aspect.\n\n4. Day one DLC. Yeah pretty lame. Be aware that even though the DLC packs are for Heman, ♥♥♥ Creed and whatever...Those character sets are available to play in the vanilla game. Purchasing the DLC packs just offers additonal toys as part of that set. For example with Masters of the Universe one of the things you get is that bad ♥♥♥ tiger thing for He Man to ride.\n\nSo far I am enjoying it. I will update the review later once I have put in some more hours and (hopefully) get to play some online co-op.","August 12, 2015","true","12.8"," 19 of 56 people (34%) found this review helpful","34","19","56","0","1"

Switched my evaluation to "not recommended" because such moves can't be tolerated. Will switch it back to "recommended" when the promised local co-op will work.\n\nEdit 2 : Official source confirmed local co-op won't be patched/added for the PC version : https://twitter.com/XShadowStormX/status/634140758044336128\n\nSo just do not buy it if you were interested by the local co-op feature. Seems Ubisoft wants you to buy the game twice and two have two computers if you want to play it locally when PS4/One users only have to buy one copy of the game.\n\nAnd it's not really because of a technical reason as ToySoldiers Complete on PC have a split-screen mode.\n\nSo my recommendation will stay on the "No", even if it's a good game. And if you bought it just for that, just ask for a refund even if you have more than two hours of play. False advertising should be enough to get a refund, whatever the hours of play you have. Feel free to also include the twitter link for a proof that it the game page had local-play on it when you bought it, as the developpers confirmed it on those tweets.","August 13, 2015","false","13.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","4"

Only thing missing is Borderless window mode but It doesnt stop you from enjoying this title.","August 13, 2015","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Playing with He-man is so cool. This game has a taste of childhood and it is amazing. It is challenging too. The problem with the DLC has been fixed.  So i can now very recommend this amazing game. Try to pick the hall of fame edition in a sale though .","March 26","true","9.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","3"

Once you figure out which army you like and what and how their towers work can easily take down any wave of enemies. I kept choosing and having a certain play style with Cobra and found that was getting quite easy with my stragety so after playing it few times after beating the game i lost interest, BUT i still had fun with it and if I used it as a casual game rather than pump few hours into it straight away it may have been more long lived.\n","December 31, 2015","true","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Ideal is solid, but the executon of it is lacking at times, especially in some major points within the game as most of the levels are repeats of levels you already have completed or the odd slow down on a high end machine.\n\nBut, overall its good time killer and especially a one to be looked at especially if you grew up playing with some of the additional armies, like Cobra, G.I. Joe, and He-Man.","January 27","true","6.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
