Games such as Deus Ex, Asheron's Call and of course Outcast.\n\nI first noticed it in a review from swedish PC gamer which i subscribed to at the time (or my dad rather) and I must have read the review and stared at the pictures a hundred times, then I got the demo and played it for hours and hours despite there not being much to do in the tutorial zone. The day I got the game I was so excited I almost ♥♥♥♥♥♥ myself while installing it and after that i spent days and days, weeks and weeks and months playing it over and over, trying different approaches.\n\nIf you like action, adventure, sci-fi with tones of fantasy, and of course a beautifully made world then you have to try this game!\n\nNow be warned that although the game has received some updates it's still very old and the graphics can glitch a little and the sound quality of the voice acting could be better.\n\nPlease support the game so we can get a proper remake and eventually a continuation of this incredible story.","December 18, 2014","true","3.2"," 158 of 175 people (90%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","90","158","175","8","3"

A game I played when it was released in 1999 in a resolution of 320x240 on my pentium 3 450 mhz computer. Outcast had to compete with games like Half-Life back then. And one reason of why the sales numbers were so low, was because the game was using the cpu to render the game. People just didn't want to upgrade their cpu's or play on a low resolution and so the game didn't reach their goal of 1 million sales. Instead they sold around 400.000 copies. Outcast 2 was in development, but because of the disappointing sales, Appeal (the original developer) went bankrupt and Outcast 2 was never released.\n\nAbout the game:\nThe game itself is absolutely fantastic. The story is very good! After I completed Outcast for the first time I was just overwhelmed by it's story. The developers did a very great job on it. It has drama, action, humor almost everything you can think of.\n\nHow does this 1.1 version run?\nWell first of of all, let me show you my specifications of my computer:\nCPU: AMD FX-8120 @ 3ghz\nGPU: Palit GTX 770 2GB\nMemory: Crucial Ballistix 2x4 GB\n\nI'm running the game on 1920x1080 and i'm getting a nice stable fps of around 30 fps. Just enough to run it smooth.\n\nAre there bugs? Yes there are bugs. For example: when the camera is facing Slate (the character you play) the surrounding disappear. After the camera faces a different direction, everything comes back. That's the only bug that I have found for now. Ow and also the recreator (a Talan that can produce ammunition for you) isn't in the village like he was in the original game but in the rice field near the mountain. Not sure if that was in the original too and that he moved later to village but that doesn't really matter imho.\n\nI really recommend you guys and girls to buy this game. It's a very small price, and with the 1.1 update you can run it in a nice resolution. Oh did I mention that the music is also very great! Music was made by the Moscow Symphony Orchestra and adds so much atmosphere to the game.\n\n","December 19, 2014","true","8.5"," 93 of 104 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","93","104","0","0"

It works great on my machine and the game hold up fantastically. Music, lore, voice acting etc. are still special 15 years after the original release. Even the old voxels look very beautiful with high resolution and a big drawing distance. There is a special organic feel to this world that has only come to polygon engines pretty recently. Still my favourite game of all time because it established a solid living and breathing open world much earlier and IMO more successfully than GTA 3 and Elder Scrolls 3: Morrowind. What makes Outcast so very special is that everything has a purpose and fits together well to form a harmonic whole.","December 18, 2014","true","4.2"," 53 of 60 people (88%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","88","53","60","4","0"

Perhaps, nostalgia is one of the main factors but one can not deny Outcast is/was a solid adventure game.\n\nOutcast takes you on a sci-fi journey in a parallel universe in which you are on a quest to save not one, but two worlds. The world filled with strange creatures and inhabitants and a rich story with romance and deceit.\n\nBack in '99, Outcast was way ahead of it's time using technologies which haven't (often) been seen in other games. Technologies like: Lip Sync and characters would actually look you in the eyes. Outcast was one of the first 3D Sandbox games (as far as I know) with beautiful graphics. The world is amazing and fun to explore and every npc has his own role in the game. The CGI also was ahead of it's time and pretty well done combined with the terrific orchestral soundtracks. Due to this, the game's production costs were very high, which should not be a real problem if it sells.\n\nSadly, Outcast did not sell well, even though almost every game magazine gave it a perfect rating. A developing attempt was made for Outcast 2 but this never happened. The kickstarter for an Outcast remake failed aswell, so the only way we ever get to see an Outcast 2 is if the classic sells well.\n\nObviously, Nowadays this is not the prettiest game anymore and the controlls are a bit wonky. Still, Outcast remains a great sci-fi experience and it's still well playable. I recommend this game to anyone who is not afraid of aged graphics and just want an amazing experience playing one of the best games ever made.\n","March 10, 2015","true","3.0"," 31 of 32 people (97%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","97","31","32","0","5"

Having beaten it for at least 5 times it is a joy to see that there is something going on.  I'll just wait a few weeks, until the bugs are fixed, and enjoy another round.\n\nBy the way, I like the Idea of a well done OC 1.1 much more than an Episode I- or Matrix 3-type of Outcast 2.\n\nThis game is a legend. Atmosphere, leveldesign and storytelling are unmatched. Thanks for the revival.","December 28, 2014","true","5.2"," 44 of 55 people (80%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","80","44","55","3","0"

Just to be able to run through the water in Shamazaar is a major relief. Game is still buggy and prone to freezing, especially when dealing with merchants so save regularly.\nI haven't tried mounting a Twon Ha yet or tried to fix the boat light which were two other known problems with the game. Personally i would've increased Cutters running speed 50% and given his basic and uza shi ammo a bit more balls but these can be done in the ini.exe file if you're feeling brave.\nWell woth a look for under a fiver. I have the GOG version but this is on another level. Most of the reviews so far are from diehard Outcast fans, it'll be interesting to read the comments of those new to the game.

If you never had a chance to play the original (1999) I highly recommend checking it out.\nOverlooking the outdated visuals and slightly dodgy animation at times, you are in for a treat.\n\nOne of the first open world 3d games with a non linear gameplay, similar to other classics such as Deus Ex.\nOrchestral soundtrack, full voice acting, native gamepad support, HD+widescreen and no dramas on modern OS. Exactly how older games should be done.\n\nWorth noting is the fact Fresh3d (http://www.fresh3d.com/) will be running another kickstarter project during 2015 for a modern day reboot of Outcast.

But if you can get past the graphics, you'll experience a fantastic game with a solid storyline that doesn't take itself too seriously but still manages to be compelling.  The amount of content in this game for the price is staggering, and the world draws you in easily.  This remastered version fixes several bugs and blatant issues that were present in the CD release (like some obvious missing quests and the SLNT-B upgrades), and makes it play smoothly on modern systems.

But I am not really sure that would be the case if I hadn't such big nostalgia for it. It was a bit like visiting old friends *sniff*\n\nBut I would never expect new players to enjoy Outcast as much as I did, even with the improvements the developers added. I still recommend it, of course, as it is one of my favourite games. My personal pro points regarding Outcast are the atmosphere, the fact that you can do a lot of quests, the music (oh, that music!), the nonlinearity and often the humor. And the music.\n\nBut yeah, the combat is a bit halfbaked, the story doesn't always make sense (although it's very immersive) and you will do a lot of walking to get to the different places, but luckily there are shortcuts if you use your tools right. And I wish the developers wouldn't have added so many achievements, as they tend to negate the atmosphere and immersion a bit.\n\nOverall, Outcast is a rewarding experience, if you can ignore its shortcomings.","December 4, 2015","true","22.9"," 21 of 23 people (91%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","91","21","23","3","0"

Here is why.\n\nIt may be old but the game is still fun and exciting. It has a enganging and epic story.\nGetting the talans to support you in your endeavour takes time but it really helps making Adelpha a believeable world.\nAlso you can actually ask your way around to find important NPCs, which I would like in many modern games instead of following a blimp on the map.\n\nAnd if you play it, just wait until you get to the city of Okriana. Then stop for a moment and just catch the atmosphere of the city, which is one of the most convincing simulations of a living city. I have yet to find a modern game which does that, GTA has the dome in which the player moves and some people/cars that surround him and AC has the same crowds always treading the same paths, so these never felt convincing, although I like these games too.\n\nOther fond memories include the regions of Okasankaar, which back then had the coolest water/ocean effects or the region of Okaar with its forest, where things were actually falling from trees. You could really see the effort and passion  the people who created this game have put into it to create a convincing and living world.\n\nAlso the game gets very good support by the devs.\nYou should definitely play it.","January 8, 2015","true","32.1"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","13","13","0","0"

What a classic of its time, unfortunately not successful enough for Infogrames (now Atari) to finance a sequel. I gladly remember being addicted to the game and being a regular member of the Infogrames forums back in the day, being part of an awesome community and helping a lot of people with the many secrets and and complexities Outcast had to offer.\n\nThe voxel engine was and still is a curiosity, resulting in a natural, non-blocky environment. While the textures are quite low-quality compared to today's standards, it is still a decently looking game. The high resolution of the remake helps with that. I am still stunned by the music and find myself regularly humming it while traversing the beautiful landscapes.\n\nI would claim the AI is still up to today's standard, the enemies seem smarter than in Skyrim (that's not saying much, but it's something). And the population with its diverse day-to-day routines make up for a believable world, which was revolutionary back then and holds up to this day.\n\nThe remake has been well done and deserves - unlike other so-called "remakes" - its name. The developer did a good job and even fixed some long-standing bugs. The introduction of the achievements was a really good thing: It highlights not-so-obvious sidequests that many people missed when the game was orginally released.\n\nIf you can live with a few quirks here and there (the game is 16 years old after all!), I can recommend Outcast 1.1 from the bottom of my heart. A dirt cheap price for an atmospheric experience many modern games aren't able to deliver.\n\nImmerse yourself into the world of Adelpha and enjoy :)","June 17, 2015","true","26.7"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","13","14","0","0"

So the day after I left a negative review, I could play the game.\n\nThat's something you only really see on pc. The Xbox controller layout is very good and the game runs well, though not nearly as surrealistically fast as the demo video which is what initially attracted me to the game. Once this game gets some type of FXAA or other antialiasing built-in it should look fairly decent for such an old game. Good enough to get some enjoyment out of. I know I've mentioned it, but having a modern control scheme makes a world of difference seeing as how many older games like Gothic 2 may forever be lost to me because of how badly they play and have likely always played.\n\nI'll give this a thumbs up now because I can play it and it's so cheap it's not like you can regret it, but I'll save my full judgement for after I've played quite a bit of the game.","December 23, 2014","true","0.9"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","13","16","0","0"

I say this becasue I haven't really played much of the game yet, other than booting it up now and then to see the improvements brought to us through almost daily updates. When I say almost daily, I mean it literally, almost every single day.\n\nThis game is already reknown as a good game, and has been for a long time. It's issues lately up to and including this release, is the game wasn't designed originally to be very future-proof. Until this release, you needed an old PC, or a lot of tweaking to get it platying proper. This is no longer the case, thanks to the 1.1 version and the hard work being put into it.\n\nI tried to get this game working for years on an old physical copy, always getting just far enough to get interested before hitting a wall of crashes or bugs. So when I seen this on steam, I bought it on Day 1. Was it worth it? Hell yes it was! Here is why:\n\nThe *new* developer, has worked and continues to work harder than any other developer releasing an older game on Steam and bringing it back to life on new PC's, than anyone else ever has.Seriously, this dude deserves a medal.\n\nLike I said, I havent played that much of this version. Mainly, because the updates are so fast and so often, I'm holding out as long as i can for the pinnacle of a gaming experience we all know is coming. Every day we get closer.\n\nSo yes, BUY THIS GAME, for no other reason besides DEVELOPERS LIKE THIS NEED OUR SUPPORT.

Even though all I had was the demo version of Outcast, I knew it was a fantastic game, and I'd play it day after day. And now, here I am, happy to say it still occupies my slot of #1 favorite game of all time.\n\nThe world is the most alive I've ever experienced, even moreso than any modern games that boast having a living world to this day. The characters and story are interesting, there's so much to discover about the world of Adelpha, and everything has an interesting or funny in-universe reason for being the way it is - right down to why the keys only work once before they break.\nAnd the combat is just plain fun! Every weapon firing relatively slow-moving projectiles means you have to run and jump around, making fights really active, and even encouraging laying traps for the enemies trying to get behind you. And if that's not your cup of tea, you can sneak around, and even do objectives that weaken your foes, so there's really something for everyone.\nThe voice acting is excellent, the music is gorgeous and perfectly fits the atmosphere, and the whole game feels so expansive and organic.\n\nOutcast is a very old game, yes, but Outcast 1.1 has made many, many improvements. It was nigh impossible to get it to run properly on modern computers before, and even the GOG version caused me major issues. The screen's flickering, Cutter walks too slowly, I can't get up on this platform I absolutely have to reach, etc.\nNow, it's fixed, and every little problem that the game had has been solved, and the problems that it still has are getting quickly taken care of day by day.\n\nOutcast has always been perfect in my eyes, and now that the developers are back and actively improving it, it's even more so.","April 9, 2015","true","143.0"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","0"

I first downloaded this game to check out what the use of Voxels would be like.  I never thought I'd love it so much so quickly.\n\nThe older version I checked quickly enthralled me, though the glitches in the version I downloaded really ruined it. I soon found out I didn't want to check out the voxels only, I felt like playing it properly! I had to buy it. The game immediately captivated me even though I hadn't even finished the tutorial.\n\nThe writer is great, the dialogues are fun and they captivated me. The characters are interesting. The story has a nostalgic 90's SciFi feel to it. The gameplay, although officially Action Adventure, has a slight RPG feel to it because of the missions. It's just a fascinating little world to explore. And the voxel technology is a very interesting thing alongside it.\n\nThis upgrade is a blast, it changes the controls to more natural settings and the graphics are nicely upgraded in a way that still lets the game stay true to itself. Though not entirely perfect and bugfree, it mostly runs smoothly and plays nicely. A tiny bug here in there shouldn't ruin it for you, just don't forget to save a lot and you'll be fine. This game is really worth it.","February 16, 2015","true","23.5"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

With keeping in the back of your mind that this game was released in 1999, this game holds up remarkebly well. Loved the world they created, really feels alive with the voice overed dialogues (on Bioware level i would say) and numerous NPC's walking around. The controls are not super though and maybe make objects like a bit more drawn (magnetic) towards you, now you really need to go over them to pick em up (sometimes I missed picking up a key or couldnt pick up item cuz of stumbling over a corpses). But overall this couch-potatoe loved the story and getting sucked into the world of Adelpha!","May 8, 2015","true","14.7"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

After 15 years, there have been little to no other games following its game concept of an open-world third-person shooter where you don't just shoot everyone (OWTPSWYDJSE in short), and the "stranger in a strange world" setting concept is almost extinct because consumers prefer things they know.\nThis game will throw you into a strange world and force you to adapt to being called the Ulukai, to everything and its mother being or having a "Fandazma", and to saving with a "Gaamsaav".\nThe gameplay is solid third-person shooting with the ability to switch to first person, but it is sadly hindered by its technical nature.\nThis is because it uses Voxels. These are basically 3D pixels that face in a certain direction, giving the illusion of a 3D world. Everything except small objects and characters is made out of Voxels. When you turn around, you'll notice "scan lines" going through the world - these adjust the Voxels into a new direction. Overall it looks really weird, but I don't know if it would look better or worse if the game had used polygon technology back then.\nPoint of the matter is that there is no such "adjusting mechanic" vertically. You'll notice that when you talk to an NPC in an elevated position - the ground behind you or them vanishes. To prevent that in normal gameplay, your camera has a very limited vertical range, even in first person, meaning you can't shoot enemies from, say a ledge. Extremely frustrating.\nTo make up for this, in third person your character will auto-aim vertically, but that's not too reliable and auto-aim sucks in general. If this was fixed, the gameplay would be absolutely solid third/first-person shooting, unless you have a fetish for chest-high walls and bloody screens.\n\nSomething else I noticed is that the voice quality seems to be low. I always thought Talan voices were modulated to sound more alien, but even the humans sound weird, which leads me to believe that they're in a low bitrate.\nLuckily, this doesn't affect the soundtrack. Which is spectacular, by the way. For one of the first games to use orchestral music, Outcast's is simply phenomenal. Incredible achievement by Lennie Moore, I would have backed the kickstarter for his involvement if nothing else.\n\nThe 1.1 improvements are good enough. The original Outcast had a highly limited resolution range (below 640x480) which could be modified to run at 1280x720 with terrible performance. This release updated that to a max resolution of 1920x1080. This is still a limit to some, but the game seems to be running with DirectX 8 currently, which has a max resolution of 2048x1536 (everything above 1920x1080 leads to problems though). The performance is still relatively bad, but playable. The game's probably biggest curiosity is that it runs entirely on the CPU, which even today simply is not made for graphical calculations. The multi-core support and updated compiler helped, but even on an Haswell-E it only uses 20% per core, resulting in a framerate of somewhere between 20 and 90 FPS.\nTo be blunt, just like the Kickstarter, the 1.1 Update has a certain amateurish vibe to it. The launcher has minor graphical glitches (and comes standard with an annoying Twitter panel that shows all Tweets mentioning Outcast), the setting menu has the standard Windows Forms icon and the intro video is played in Windows Media Player, and is stretched from 4:3 to 16:9. Still - it does its job, and the ongoing updates are laudable.\n\nOverall, I'd say that Outcast 1.1 is worth its money, and moreso because unlike with other old games the money actually goes to the developers.

The made up alien language sounds silly, and they somehow also speak English (or at least it seems that way). But it’s entertaining. It’s one of those things that are so cheesy they’re lovable.\n\nThe same can be said for the animation; it’s basically a lower-resolution version of Team America. The forehead wrinkles and eyebrow movement must have been new at the time, because they certainly spared no expense in using them. The price of admission is worth it just to watch the hilarious expressions the characters make.  And the mouth movement is pretty much exactly like Team America, because of the limited jaw movement available for the character models.\n\nAnd the controls! They’re just as amusing as the story and animation! They’re just so weird. For example, when you first start and if you haven’t drawn your weapon, the left mouse button is a jump button. It’s completely weird and doesn’t really work, but it’s so quirky that it’s entertaining! Also, the screen text read, “Press the Space Bar to crawl,” but that also made me jump. I just messed with the buttons until I figured out that C was to crawl.\n\nCharacter interaction was amusing too; I was trying to figure out how to stealth in the game for a quest, kept failing because of the weird buttons (was slowly getting it), and apparently the character took pity on me and then gave me an item to help me out…and the item wasn’t even remotely useful for that one quest haha. Anyway, failed again just because the funky controls (was my first quest and apparently was supposed to be the “hard” quest), and rather than make me do the quest…the character was like “Don’t worry…a lot of the young warriors can’t complete this quest…” Basically, I received the ultimate gaming insult, an “A for effort.”  I also found this amusing, because what game does that?!\n\nIf you want a silly, quirky game and you don’t mind learning odd controls, I would recommend this game. It’s just too unique to pass up.\n\nAlso, I wasn’t actually even going to play this game for a while (too many other ones to play), but almost every time I turn on Steam, there’s an update to some part of this game. Usually it’s only a few mb, but so many updates. I haven’t ever had a game that was so well-supported, and based on that level of customer service, I would buy this game again in a heartbeat. Thank you, caring developer! While I may not have the time to finish this little gem for a while, I notice and appreciate the effort!\n\nI won’t give this a rating out of 10 because I’m extremely biased about my love for B-rank cult-classics; but I will say this, if you love that type of stuff too, I would definitely get this game. It’s a silly good time, and it seems like the developer really cares about it, even after all these years, and that means something (at least to me it does). If you want to support sci-fi silliness, love, and B-rank goodness, this is a good purchase. If you don’t like all of those things, just be warned that it’s not gonna be some open-world Star Wars game. If you don't mind the controls, you still might like it for the unique experience.","January 29, 2015","true","0.4"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","70","7","10","3","0"

Thanks to the higher resolutions we get more detail of the wonderful world called Adelpha. The graphics are the same as the original, but the voxel technology still allows for some stunning imagery. The music is as brilliant as it has ever been. One of the very best video game soundtracks that will immerse you in this world all over again.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/flintgf/recommended/336610/","flintgf","Fantastic Mr Flint","http://steamcommunity.com/id/flintgf/","197 products in account","First things first, let's make my feelings on this game clear: I place Outcast among my favourite games of all time, right up there with Deus Ex, Fallout 2, Half-Life and other classics. It's a masterpiece, and it still holds up incredibly well. The graphics may have dated, but the gameplay is still really solid and to this day very few games have managed to match the sheer amount of depth and effort Appeal poured into the alien world they created, which feels like a genuine place with its own culture and language. Even the score is excellent and it's one of the very few orchestral scores I rate.\n\nBut Outcast 1.1 is a little problematic. The little improvements it does on the technical side of things are fairly negligible compared to the sheer amount of issues it presents. It's glitchy as hell: during my playthrough I encountered various bugs from the minor (achievements being triggered by cutscene actions) to the genuinely bothersome (certain sidequests were impossible to complete due to critical items vanishing, while others simply never triggered). These issues were never present in the original or the GoG release a while back, so I'm a little hesitant in calling the Steam release wonderful.\n\nMy advice? Unless you're really hardcore about Steam or really want those trading cards or achievements (some of which require you to do some really stupid things you would never dream of doing otherwise), get the GoG release. It's smoother and stabler. The positive recommendation is for the game itself.","May 2, 2015","true","14.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The combat is simple but challenging and the stealth works good enough.\nFor the time the graphics are insane.

But the result of these graphics where that the game hat a very low resolution. This version fixes that.

It was the best game I had ever played and so far ahead of anything I had ever seen before in so many areas (and still is to this day). Now 15 years later I have still not found a game that can surpass it. How forgotten and unoticed this game is, is still the biggest tragedy in the gaming industry and any gaming journalist or anyone else that regard themself a person of gaming history that writes about games that have not played this deserves a spit in the face. To see list after list of the best games of all time and constantly see how Outcast is not celebrated where it belong on the top 10 games of all time because so few people know about it is just a disgrace to the whole industry.\n\nDo yourself a favor and play the game. It might take some time to get into, but once you do you will see so many unique things that have not even been replicated to date. I must say the trailer is also kind of misleading, it makes it look like an action game where you only shoot things. But that is not what this is, it is an adventure game where exploration and dialogue with interesting characters is the main gameplay. The story and the lore in the game is equally impressive and everything in the game world seems to have an explenation and a purpose, making it all feel like a real world you are exploring.\n\nIt also includes the most epic soundtrack in any game.\n\nAlso check out the Outcast Reboot HD version in the Greenlight section. http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=253011564&searchtext=outcast","June 18, 2015","true","0.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Had the original boxed version as a kid.  Replayed the old GOG version. But this version is very disappointing so far. I think a lot more effort could have been put in to ''enhance'' this version. Such as better textures, models and draw distance. Why should I still see the terrain pop in just ahead of me? Surely there's a way to make the draw distance better...\n\nAlso, when I'm in in conversation, even in the first area, the background frequently disappears leaving a plain white background in it's place.\n\nI'd like to think the devs would fix at least the draw distance and disappearing backgrounds....\n\nEDIT - Yeah, it's better now. Well done Devs. Would recommend! It's one of the best games ever made.\n\nStone - ''0.6 hours on record. Really?

Ever. If you kill a guy and he drops money you didn't grab, it'll be there 20 hours later.\n\nIf you killed an enemy, it remains dead, forever.\n\n\n\n+A ton of great content to explore.\n+Great variety in tasks, weapons, and enemies.\n+Decent challenge\n\n-Developed before graphics accelerators, built on CPU rendering so the game isn't gorgeous\n-Some of the quests aren't very clear on what to do/where to go next\n-Not enough people backed the kickstarter to modernize the game\n\nSummary: Despite not being the prettiest game, Outcast 1.1 is a MUST buy for anyone who likes action/adventure games.","November 2, 2015","true","40.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And rightfully so , this game was way ahead of its time. Although hub based, the open world feels really full of life and diverse. It offers freedom few games at the time offered. Sneaking and/or third/first person shooting  your way trough a sci-fi open world? Upgradeable weapons? Numerous VOICED dialog options for each and every NPC you come across?  You can ride animals even? Teenage me would have wet his pants. Sadly I have missed this game when it came out , but now ,after all those years I can safely say this is one of the best games of '99. The orchestral soundtrack rocks my world. I have continued listening to it even after completing the game. Something I can say for few games.","February 17","true","25.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game originally came out in 1999, so obviously the graphics and some mechanics are dated but that doesn't matter cause it's immersive and unique. The re-release feels like a labor of love, and the addition of Steam trading cards and (many, many) achievements is a nice touch.
