Be warned if applying for a drivers licence in the north, you might forget where the line between game and reallity is and start chatting jazz poetry at real people who don't care for that sort of thing. Enjoy adventures and isometric art? Want to know more about the "Meat raffle"? Well worth a look!","May 13","true","0.8"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

It is a thoroughly bizarre and utterly hilarious point and click adventure. I haven't had this dense laughs per minute in an adventure game for ages. You are a poet. You are in an absurd British beatnik microverse. It is brilliant.","May 15","true","0.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It's all about some former detective trying to be an artist in a world run by comical government restrictions.\n\nThe aesthetics are simple, but oddly perfect for the game. There's just enough detail to know what's going on, but it still looks like a bland world, which is clearly what the devs were going for.\n\nThe dialogue options are amusing, to say the least. The various characters definitely fit their intended roles.\n\nOverall, if you're interested in this game, go for it. It's small, but nicely made, and you won't regret devoting a few hours to it.","May 14","true","0.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
