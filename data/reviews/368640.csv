Read on!\n\nThe Firefly Diary is a port of a PSVita title, and has some of the problems that are expected such as 30FPS locks and a weaker visual fidelity... but not all is bad!\n\nFull review:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yjg1GUZ9PY\n\nText:\nThe game's biggest weakness outside of it's lack of technical prowess is the fact that the game play is So.Very.Slow. So unless you either LIKE or can somehow at the very least STAND the slow game play, this is not the game for you.\n\nAs the game says, it's a puzzle / platformer, though the platforming is minimal to say the least... and the puzzles are not particularly challenging, most solutions are immediately visible even if completing them often takes timing, which might take a few tries and a few minutes of your time, courtesy of the slow game play.\n\nThankfully the game's art style is the strongest suit of the game, and coupled with a pretty interesting story - told NOT through dialogue, but all through expose and visuals is pretty damn good.\n\nWhere the game also gets bonus points is the very frequent quick saves and checkpoints, saving you lots of time lost. Where it loses a lot of those extra points is the slow as balls movement of the character and animations.\n\nThankfully, a big issue with the PS Vita, were the touch controls, and the game solves though by virtue of mouse and keyboard.\n\nOverall a game to pick up if the art style and story draw you in, and one to avoid if you want a challenging puzzle experience.","May 18","true","8.8"," 65 of 83 people (78%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","78","65","83","8","6"

Firefly Diary is no exception to the rule. I died literally hundreds of times, shouted countless obscenities, and swore I'd never play it again... then continued playing it.\n\nWhat sets this game apart from the others is the sparse yet incredible story. I never thought I'd shed a tear at 2D sprites without so much as a line of dialogue present. For this price, I'd wholly recommend it for the story alone.

I mean, sometimes it can be tough to make Mion stop doing something and so something else.\n\nIt does have a really good atmosfere, and I can appreciate that this game basically has no dialogue (Only lines of text you'll see in the game are the tutorials), so if you consider yourself a patient person, I'd recommend giving this a try if you're looking for a short cheap game.\n\nPC port is capped at 30FPS, but the developers made a pretty good post explaining why is that (It's on the discussion forum); you can change resolutions too, but since it's a fully 2D game, you'd be just scaling the images up and down, which doesn't look too hot. Also, you can play it with mouse only; it puts some buttons on the screen, which kinda hurts the atmosfere, but hey, it's great if you want to play the game on a tablet or something.","May 18","true","1.1"," 29 of 35 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","29","35","2","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ark7298/recommended/368640/","ark7298","Daydreaming Uzume","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ark7298/","59 products in account","htol#NIQ, or Hotaru no Nikki (if you want a clearer pronounciation), reminds me a lot of various indie puzzle platformers such as Limbo, and Braid. It is also a dark and twisted puzzle platformer game.\nYou control a firefly that controls a young girl and that firefly acts as her guide. You also control a firefly within her shadows that can manoeuvre its way through other shadows and use it to do things like activate switches, cut roots, stun shadow monsters, and more.\nThe controls are very simple and all you need is just your mouse to play. You can play the game with a controller, sure, but as it was originally a Vita title where you used the touchscreen to control the firefly, the mouse is a natural with this game.\nHowever, even if the controls are simple, you'll learn that it's not easy playing this game. You'll face trial and error when you learn that Mion dies in one hit. This means that you have to be extremely careful on guiding her. On top of that, this is a puzzle platformer. You have to solve a lot of puzzles using both fireflies. Each level presents itself with various new puzzles to take on, from levers, to parasol/mushroom floating, and even lumen mazes that remind you of some science experiments where you're not allowed to touch the edge. Bosses make big use of the environment around you making it so that you will have to do certain things to beat that particular boss while still providing a means of trying to kill Mion. I like the variety in these puzzles, however, as with most puzzle games, they aren't easy. In fact, this is a trial and error game, where one mistake might be the end of Mion. At least however, it provides the right amount of frustration where you can overcome all the trials purely on skill (it's not luck that wins, other puzzle games). Want an extra challenge? Each level, including boss levels, has special achievements ranging from finishing a certain portion of a level in a certain amount of time and in few things (door openings, lever pullings), to discovering a hidden moon, and more.\nPerhaps the big thing about this little game is the backstory. Scattered in each level (except boss levels), are memory fragments. Touch them and you'll be taken to this isometric pixel game where you'll learn so much of the game's backstory... who Mion is, and the secret behind her parents. Behind this game lies some of the darkest secrets towards the game's story. Be on the lookout for these memory fragments, because you may be in for a shock. And to make it clear, it may feel like a horror game, but it isn't entirely horror.\nThe bottom line, this is a fun puzzle platformer game that harkens the good days of indie puzzle platformers. It was a big shock to me when I learned a lot about this game's story, but it also made me think critically on puzzle solving, while still getting frustrated by all those deaths (Fun note: dying does give you some achievements). Also another part of why it reminds me of indie platformers is the art style, which is magnificent. In an age where most people play mostly uninspiring puzzle games on mobile, this is the puzzle game that I need to help break the trend. You should give this game a go, especially if you have a tablet PC or a Vita.","May 20","true","20.1"," 21 of 22 people (95%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","95","21","22","2","0"

The puzzles are not quite hard to figure out, but you need some patience to not mess it up. I mean you still need some determination to pull it off. However, you don't have to spend much time in front of you computer and think "How to do this...hmm". Instead you will be "I will be able to get this in a few times."\n+ About the story: true story has never been confirmed by anything, so it requires you to put all the pieces of information you can find in this game and predict it. You can read the interpretation from various source, but at the end of the day, how do you think is what important. In my way of thinking, the story can be considered dark though, but the game has somewhat happy ending.\nThe biggest technical downside is probably 30 FPS, but developers have a reason for it, any the game is quite slow-paced so 60 FPS, while certainly look better, is somewhat trivial.\nP/S: I am a beta tester and I received this game for free, yet the game costs $15, which is pretty cheap anyway, I wrote this short review without reading any other reviews for this game.","May 18","true","38.2"," 25 of 37 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","25","37","0","0"

The Playstation Vita port is beatiful to look at and haunting to experience, as you try to play the father figure trying to keep Mion safe through the horrors. With an interesting angle in control shadows, the game does have some unique puzzles to throw at you, and does have a couple of great narrative moments without dialogue, with scenes such as seeing the moon for the first time. But the gameplay is where the game falls apart. The game asks for too much precision, down to seemingly the quarter of a second, in situations where you don't have the knowledge in order to complete the puzzle in the circumstances given. These leads to one of the most frustrating puzzles games that I've played, where reattempts of these puzzles over and over again led to me wanting to flip every table in a 5 mile radius. It's all about the design here: a more active set of controls or a little bit more leancy on the time windows would have made a good game: but in the end, The Firefly Diary makes you want to bash your head against the keyboard if you have anything but a very high frustration tolerance.\n\nVideo Review:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmogqMT1Sjs\n\nLists:\nPositives:\nBeautiful game. A lovely presentation is the backdrop for the game's puzzles, which does a reasonable job of storytelling while setting the mood as well.\nMion serves as a great protagonist, as you want to keep her safe while she works her way through the darkness and misery.\nMemory segments provide some back story and is just cute to watch...until it gets creepy. Then it gets more interesting.\nAtmosphere is strong. You feel an unease as something naturally crawls toward you, or having to deal with huge saws that you have to maneuver Mion through them.\nMusic is fitting for the two sections.\nPerformance doesn't have any frame drops. Despite it not being 60 FPS (although they did their best to try this, but unlocking it makes it go 2x the speed), it still works for the game in question.\nSome of the puzzles are good, and the shadow mechanic is interesting. I'd like to see more done with it in the future.\nNegatives:\nDoes a bad job of informing the player within a reasonable time of a problem upcoming. Even strong observational skills won't make a difference at times: you will die when the game surprises you with something that you'll wonder how you could have foreseen what was coming.\nThe game asks for some very very precise execution on some puzzles, and the controls won't give you that precision. Even when knowing exactly what to do, being off by what seems to be a quarter of a second on a button press will mean that you'll fail and wonder exactly what the game wants from you.\nThe puzzle design in general doesn't do a good job of working well with the games mechanics. The designs are good....in other sets of mechanics.\nThe game does a bad job of teaching you some new mechanics. The first time I got the mushroom in the game, I completely didn't understand that it could be used as a umbrella. It makes sense looking at, but it'd be better to give an in game example to show what could happen. And that doesn't happen because:\nHave I mentioned how frustrating the game was?\nSometimes the game spawns you in a weird position. Like for example, beyond something that is critical to the next puzzle.\nA couple of cases where the environment seems to have a trap upcoming, but instead, it's just part of the scenery.\nMenus could be optimized a little better.

I don't believe this influences my review. Much of this reccomendation comes from having loved it on Vita as well.)\n\nExperimentation makes a lot of interesting things happen. In this case, it lead to the creation of a 2D puzzler-platformer that had absolutely no prescedent within Nippon Ichi's lineup. And I feel like they made something truly beautiful with this journey outside the comfort zone.\n\nThis game is a tale of visual splendor, with a plot told through visuals and metaphors, with no spoken lines or dialog. It's simplistic, the puzzles are light on logic, but heavy on timing and interaction. Deaths are frequent but checkpoints are plentiful and time lost is minimal. I only genuinely experienced frustration in my attempts to clear all the achievements.\n\nThe optimal control scheme is mouse and keyboard, but keep in mind your in-game "cursor" (the firefly, Lumen) does not move 1:1 with your cursor: she moves toward your cursor when you hold down the mouse button. Controller options are available, but honestly, I feel like mouse and keyboard controls are the notch that brings this version above the Vita version in playablity.\n\nAs someone who played the Vita version to completion, I believe this game is worth the price of entry for story and visuals alone. If you dislike slow gameplay, meticulous puzzling, or frequent deaths, this won't be for you. Otherwise, please check it out. It's a criminally underrated gem of a game that got roughed up by critics on the Vita due to criticism of the touch controls (which were always optional). It deserves the attention and love that more developed NIS titles bask in.","May 18","true","12.4"," 15 of 24 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","15","24","0","0"

Some of this is down to Mion’s atrocious speed and the way she shuffles after her firefly helper on her little, unsteadily legs. On one hand, it does promote a huge aura of vulnerability and inspires a certain measure of protectiveness from the gamer. On the other, waiting for her to get from point to point can be excruciating. For the most part, the game itself keeps in sync with the laborious pace; little shadow monsters try to chase down the little heroine at set intervals but never dial their pace up from an uncomfortable creep as Mion casually strolls away. Other pitfalls are less forgiving and demand a series of prompt and precise commands the interface is often not up to. To this end, you will often easily figure out what you need to do to bypass a puzzle or a deathtrap; you’ll just find yourself eating countless deaths while you try to unsuccessfully pull it all together.\n\nFull Review // http://www.honestgamers.com/13009/pc/htolniq-the-firefly-diary/review.html","June 1","true","14.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

That being said the port seems very well done.  The visuals are upscaled and fine details are much easier to see.  It runs great and I haven't had any technical issues yet.  The mouse controls are also fantastic and work very well for the game, better than any method on the Vita.  And the sound design is also improved, which is a huge plus because the game has amazing music.\n\nWith that out of the way, I love this game.  It is however difficult to recommend to everyone.  It's a game meant for people who like frustrating but fair games, and who can forgive some gameplay shortcomings for atmosphere and presentation.  That being said, the game still provides quality gameplay and interesting puzzles.  At its heart, htol#niq is a puzzle platformer, mixed with a bit of classic escort oriented games.  The story is presented entirely through environment and gameplay.\n\nIf this sounds like your kind of game, I would strongly recommend Firefly Diary.","May 24","true","0.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Mion moves at a snails pace, and it artificially punishes you with how slow it moves because if you end up failing a puzzle you have to start over and do it at this game's slow pacing.\n-Personal preference, but not a fan of the indie-game style way it tells its story, where a lot of it is implied\n-Chapter 4 is a mess of game design. Confusing maze puzzles, several trial and error rooms (including a door that literally kills you with no way of telling that it does it), puzzles which force you to die if you mess up, it felt like I'm playing a Super Mario Maker level.\n-Mion is not directly controlled. Because of how this game is designed, there are several frustrating occasions in which needless frustration would have simply been avoided if she was able to be directly controlled. Likewise, the firefly is only "steered", making the mouse controls for this game more frustrating than they need to be.
