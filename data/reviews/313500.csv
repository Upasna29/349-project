I played this many years ago along with the first one, Now the first game has terrible graphics but is still playable. Blitzkrieg 2 is a lot better but you still have to manouvre around the age barrier of the game. Realistic to an extent as bombers actually destroy tanks and not just knock a little bit off the huge red health bar games tend to have these days. You can build trenches, road blocks and other types of obstacles which make the  whole concept a lot more appealing. I have the first on disc (still) and just downloading this second anthology now, deffinitely worth the time and specially worth the low cost of money for the amount of gameplay you will get out of this!\n\n8/10\n\n(If you played the older generation of Command and Conquer, then you will absolutely love this!)","September 17, 2014","true","39.4"," 80 of 87 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","80","87","2","1"

Whether you get this or the first game, it'll be well worth the the $5 fee. It has a great campaign with famous battles from World War II, with the ability to play as America, Russia, or Germany. Beyond that it has a great custom map editor that allows you to create entire campaigns. The possibilities are endless with the map editor and a healthy amount of mods for anyone who wants anything extra. To add to this deal, the game includes both expansion packs for free.","September 18, 2014","true","7.5"," 39 of 42 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","39","42","0","0"

Have been playing it for years and still holds its replay value with great multiplayer and campaigns. I recommend this game to any WW2 lovers or just strait up strategy gamers.\n\nWhy get this game?:\n\n- posseses almost every vehicle and artillery system used in World war 2, ranging from the French Renault R35 to the Russian IS-3 main battle tank\n- Great multiplayer with a small but growing community of players\n- Requires tactics over massed tank rushes(unless you want to be slaughtered by your friends entrenched infantry and anti-tank guns!)\n- Deployable air support such as B-29's, Me-262's, and the famous P-51 Mustang\n- An amazing single player campaign throughout the game and its added expansions featuring US/UK, German, and Soviet campaigns with the Russian one featuring one of the most epic last stands in history known as the Battle of Berlin","October 29, 2014","true","174.4"," 31 of 32 people (97%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","97","31","32","0","0"

Campaign was really good in my opinion, but multiplayer is where it really shines.\n\nSadly, there is a problem with the screen tearing and I do not know how to fix it. It really bugs me and I wish I could find a solution. Hopefully they add an update and fix it. It seems to happen with people who use 1920 x 1080 resloutions.\n\nAnother downfall to this is that multiplayer is disabled, which is a really huge shame. I hope this gets enough support and they will add steam servers to Blitzkrieg II\n\nOverall, if you like any RTS, (especially company of heroes) then i definatly recommended this game.","October 13, 2014","true","5.4"," 31 of 33 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","31","33","0","1"

I remember playing this game for hours on end, even had a 6 hour multiplayer game once (not proud, but sorta proud). The campaign is amazing, very indepth and offers tremendous amounts of player skill to vary the outcomes of any scenario. You can play a total of three campaigns, one for USA, Germany, and Soviet Russia. Although these campaigns are great, and could easily suck up a few days of your time, the real fun is in the multiplayer area. The game is a totally different animal and is immensely fun as a multiplayer, unfortunately the multiplayer function is disabled :'( I'm sure this is one game that steam would not regret opening some multiplayer servers for. Back in the day, this game always had around 50 people playing it at any time, which is much higher than most RTS games can say for their landing lobby. If you're into WW2 tactics and creating your own strategies in real-time combat, this is the game for you.","November 29, 2014","true","29.3"," 25 of 26 people (96%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","96","25","26","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ShadowStuff/recommended/313500/","ShadowStuff","Shadow","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ShadowStuff/","388 products in account","So I'm just going to get directly into pros and cons...\n\nPros:\n1. Is a classic.\n2. Has amazing gameplay, this game actually requires you to think rather than rush in although the rush tactic does work in some cases, however you'll find yourself screwed most of the time.\n3. Has a really good unit roster.\n4. Unit types are actually quite balanced. This is extremely rare in most games, as usually one unit wins you games, however this game does a great job at making you use a mix of different types of units to get the job done, and does a really good job at giving you multiple different options, and approaches to tackling a situation.\n5. Is better than company of heroes. Yes I said it, the graphics might not be, but the gameplay is, by a mile.\n6. Is not one sided! While each country has their strengths and weaknesses, there is no one country that has an advantage over another, it's all dependent on how you use them.\n\nCons:\n1. Outdated graphics. Ya, it's an old game, it's graphics are not the best, but if you play games for graphics, I refuse to call you a gamer.\n2. A kinda annoying AI. The unit pathfinding, and general AI are a little bit buggy, but that can't be helped, it is quite an old game, you usually only notice this when massing units, or trying to make tanks go through heavy object areas.\n3. A kinda dead multiplayer. Yes it's unfortunate, but it's an old game, can't expect any people to still be playing it, and as far as I'm aware it currently doesn't even have a multiplayer server, could be wrong, haven't checked steam MP yet.\n\nSide Notes:\n1. I have way more than 4.7 hours in this game, as I still have my disk copy, just recently picked this up on steam, totally worth.\n2. Playing the campaign on very hard will make you cut yourself :D\n3. The singeplayer is more than worth the 4.99 for the game, lol if only it's multiplayer wasn't so dead.","March 15, 2015","true","5.9"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","14","17","0","2"

The second i started the tutorials i realised that brute force and overwhelming numbers don't work. You have to use strategy, such as an artillery bombardment before your charge, or hitting the enemy in the rear and making there defences useless. The reinforcements system forces you to think about what the attack will cost you, it affects you in the long run. They feature that cought me off gaurd is the ammo system, your tanks and soldiers RUN OUT of ammo, when this happens you need to have a supply truck resuply them, and they have a limited supply, making ware houses (infinit supplies) something to defend as well as your supply routs to the front lines. Further more unlike some games that just copy paste units, every side (even the NPCS) have thier own unique rooster of units giving them an advantage in thier field. Germans: Tanks Soviets: Rocket artillery Americans: Jack of all trades. The graphics arn't master pieces but they are pretty good for 2005. As the campaigns go on, you steadily start being assigned larger and more important missions, which makes it feel as if you are rising through the ranks from some leutenant commanding a few squads of infantry and a hand full of tanks to a general commanding an army to glory. Over all it is a very realistic RTS, gameplay wise, and it will apeal to those who like a realistic RTS.\n\nPROS:\nunique units all around\nrealistic combat\nsupply lines\nentrenchment abilities (mines, trenches, obstacles.)\nbridges can be destroyed and take engineering crews to rebuild\nunits run out of ammo\nlimited number of reinforcments\nwell balanced (MOAR TANKS! strategy doesn't work)\nUse your own strategy\nAI actually does stuff (most of the time[sometimes forgets it can reload artillery])\nStrategy required (can't just charge and hope for things to turn out OK)\n\nCONS:\ngraphics\nSoviet Rocket truck spam(3 SRTs> 50 German medium tanks gaurding a town)\nHave to micromanage my army. Lost 5 tanks to a Bofors AA gun in plain site, but they just let it shoot them because i didn't tell them to shoot. XD\n\nRating 9/10 very good RTS but units are as incompetent as chickens","January 29, 2015","true","148.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It is certainly iterative, as the core gameplay remains largely intact. The scenarios are more varied and dynamic than those of the original game, which makes for more compelling gameplay. I've beaten two of the three campaigns the base game comes with, which took me about 30 hours on Hard difficulty.\n\nThe game is at it's best when you control a slightly under-equipped battle group and need to use reconnaissance and cunning tactics to decide how best to dismantle enemy resistance.\n\nMy biggest criticism is that as the campaigns ramp up, the scenarios pit battlegroups of increasing size and firepower against each other, to the point where the only viable scenario is to incrementally carpet bomb everything in your way to avoid taking unmanageable losses.\n\nStill a great game overall.","January 20, 2015","true","83.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

HOW IS A TRUCK ABLE TO BLOW UP IN 2 SECONDS AFTER BEING FIRED BY A 5 MEN SQUAD WITH BLOODY MP40s?!!!!\n\nOnly on your side there is a strategy, but by the part of the AI, there is no strategy or whatsoever... The AI looks pretty much like a 12 year old kid that just select all the units on the screen and order a full out assault.\nPlus, you can't do anything to stop it, since your MG nests, even though they are entrenched, are going to be cleared within a *blink* of yours... and AT guns? well, they do have some AP power, but absolutelly no defence... A german rifleman can just aim at it and with his magical 900/rounds per minute Ka98, is going to rekt him, only if the AT gun is paying attention somewhere, because if not, its probable that the poor rifleman is going to face his worst nightmare... A Machinegun enplacement with the ability to fire AP shells.\n\n+Plus, the infantary requires some hacking-like skills to be fully used, I have lost the count of how many times I have seen entire companies being whiped out in questions of seconds by OPS AT guns and mortars... And I bet those entrenched british make those poor germans think they are back at Verdun...\nAlso, don't EVER trust the AI... It is more dumb than... well... the level is so low that I can't even explain it. I GOES OUT OF THE RANKING.\nI can't think of why the developers would made a tank AI so dumb that it just TURNS ITS BACK ARMOR to the enemy when ordered to go back... Also, it doesn't really looks like the AI has more functions than:\n1. Avoiding hitting hard objects (houses per example)\n2. Shooting with a shameful precision sometimes and a sniper some other times.\n3. Fire and reload faster than Flash on cocaine (giving a new meaning to "BlitzKrieg")...\n\nIf you are looking for realistic gameplay, this is a REALLY fast paced game, so you do better get away from this page right now and never come back.\nIn the other hand, if you are looking for CHALLENGING gameplay, this is the game for you!\nthe game where a Panzer III would get rekt by a british AA gun, and where Light AT guns shot like machineguns...\n\n\nP.S: After writting this review I guess I just discovered the meaning behind the name "Blitzkrieg".\n\n","May 24","false","9.8"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","25","1","4","2","0"

This sequel looks the original one, but without the ability to mount, equip and keep your own forces like in the previous game, in this version you can only use the vehicles they give you. You also can't repeat battles to get additional upgrades to your forces.\n\nThe maps are terrible and most of time you just can´t maneuver because there are single roads running directly to enemy fire. I played the first 3 battles and the only artillery I got was two mortars I captured from enemy. Air support was useless as they did not attacked the chosen coordinates but far away targets\n\nHowever, the reason I uninstalled this game is the annoying AI. All the time your troops move without orders, tanks turn their backs to the enemy when ordered to retreat and many other AI issues. I cant stand so many silly behavior. So I can only advise you to do not buy this game.","May 29, 2015","false","4.6"," 15 of 33 people (45%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","45","15","33","0","0"

Blitzkreig 2 is for hardcore fans the ones who know to play, i suggest you try it but trust me it wont be easy.","April 6, 2015","true","10.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It offers very pleasant graphics and an enjoyable gameplay. It offers a lot of missions through 3 different campains and each mission is truly unique in it`s own way. They could range from full scale assault operation to bloody deffensive missions and also to specialised missions. There are 3 campains you could choose: either you can play as the allies starting in the pacific campains and ending your war on the western front, you can play for Germany starting with the fall of france and then standing your ground in the west as the reich falls and finally you can play on the bloodiest fields of the eastern front as the soviets and then drive your attack all the way to Berlin. You will always be stuck with the dilema of what type of reinforcements you should call in and moreover, as a strategist, you have to know when to deploy them. Be aware however that you are also limited to a certain amount of reinforcements that you can call on the battlefield in every mission which adds the fact that you should carefully plan your attacks and that every move you make may end up granting you victory or leading to your inevitable end. Also, unlike the first blitzkrieg, this one has a more enhanced army upgrading system. Each mission, once accomplished, rewards you with much better equipment and therefore makes your army much more efficient and advanced. In addition you can assigne officers to your different  army branches which with experience receive combat bonuses. This allows to therefore customise your army. In general, this is a very nice RTS game. A very worthy sequel following the first game. If enoy RTS games in general then I`d say it`s defenitely a must have.","June 4, 2015","true","60.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Hidden missions on a good number of maps also give experienced players something extra to look for.","May 30","true","13.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
