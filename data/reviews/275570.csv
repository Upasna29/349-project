I played the PC console-port of this game and liked it, for the most part.  Keep in mind the graphics are dated, and the engine is dated, but it's still fun to play.  I remember running into some graphical glitches and some quest glitches that were annoying, but didn't ruin the game for me.  I'm a fan of the Volition games like Freespace 1 and 2 and this game was a fun departure from that game style.  That said, I really, really, really hope Freespace 1 and 2 come to Steam!  Summoner is a good console game port and is a fun game.  I remember the summoning being extremely compelling and it kept me playing all those years ago.  I'm looking forward to playing it again!","March 12, 2014","true","0.3"," 89 of 103 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","89","103","0","11"

Before you get it, though, remember that it came out over a decade ago.  If you're a graphics ♥♥♥♥♥ look somewhere else, and be aware that it needs a simple (less than 5 minutes) fix to run correctly on modern machines.  It has its imperfections but they're heavily outweighed by fun combat that you still have to think about, meaningful skill points, and the basic fun of summoning everything from a floating sword to the incarnation of death to help you in fights.\n\nA quick rundown of the negatives: Has what one might call "old game syndrome" (no auto saves, quests rely on a walkthrough or you being persistant, such as finding an item in a town and you're not given any clue as to where it is, enemies can really spike in difficulty, and other things that games have more or less grown out of) story is a bit predictable at times, some parts of the game drag on for a long time while others you just walk in walk out, if you put skill points into the wrong skills you're at a decent disadvantage, possibly completely screwed if you decided that you would max all wrong skills first, the game's a bit easy, especially if you know or find some of the more exploitative mechanics, the AI is more than a bit dodgy at times, and the voice actor of the main character is honestly so-so\n\nThe positives: Loot system as well as exploration feels rewarding, varied gameplay, while there may be a functional best build there is far from only one build to make your characters strong, very nice aesthetics to the game, combat is fun, I only felt it to be grind-y when I was literally grinding to catch up on a few skills before I hit a big boss, you level up frequently enough that you feel like you're constantly improving and if you decide you really need a skill you can get the points fast enough, good plot that has a number of twists, bosses (and a number of regular enemies) are challenging without needing 20 tries to defeat, the summons are very fun to use and can make hard areas easy, and the side quests can also be extremely rewarding","September 28, 2014","true","31.5"," 40 of 42 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","40","42","0","0"

While it is currently debated among some friends, I still think Summoner is the inspiration for Skyrims tale. You are born with a mark that allows you to summon, but not until you get proper training, even the king without an heir (his 4 sons died under strange circumstances, and one idiot move), While some argue this is a storyline of many games and movies, I feel this one is very close to how Skyrim is written\n\nThe world appears gigantic, however downside, is there are not enough NPC's to make up for the space. So it feels empty in these otherwise large towns, cities and buildings.\n\nMusic is modern - odd choice, you would expect something celtic - but it works - at least for me.\n\nGraphicly, it is the style of the old Gothic RPG, maybe a little less, but the story is amazing and the mechanics are great. The casting of spells have nice animation, and I was pleased to see that most of the A.I. on your team works well. Sometimes you have to make sure they are attacking the right mob, but for the most part they know where to go.\n\nThere has been a massive complain that the game runs to fast on modern systems, so with that, I'll post here in this review how to fix that - For $5 its a good buy! Get it.\n\n---- ------------------------------------------------------------\n---- SLOW DOWN FIX FOR SUMMONER\n---- Tested with Win 7 64bit QUAD Core..\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\nWin7 64bit QUAD Core - Here is a fix I used. Work very nice\nIf you have tinkered with the V-Sync then you already know thatt is a hit and miss (system dependent)\nChanging the Afinnity will not work either, as these games are made to run on single core (sometimes dual core), and will not recognize anything other than that. So using more cores is impossible\n\nHere is a successful option, that works on many games (and some DOS games as well).\nI know it works in win7, if you have another OS and can follow this method - please confirm.\n\nCREATE A NEW POWER MANAGEMENT\nGo to control panel: In the search box (upper right) type POWER then click "Choose a power plan"\nA new split view will open.\nSelect "Create a New Power Plan" (left side panel)\nSelect High Performance\nAnd name it something like "Old Games"\nNext\nChange both settings in the next view to NEVER\nClick "Create"\n\nNow you will see your new power setting (now selected). Click on "Change plan settings"\nYou'll now have a link that says "Change advanced Power settings"\nScroll down to "Processor Power Management"\nChange the Minimum Processor State to 1% (YES ONE PERCENT)\nChange the Maximum Processor State to 1% (SAME)\n\nSave it, your done.\nNO YOUR COMPUTER WILL NOT RUN AT 1% but it will force it to use the lowest possible processor state as most games are run by state of the processor.\nWhich this will likely be somewhere between 500-800mhz.\n\nduring play there were a few (very rare) minor speed glitches, but they lasted a fraction of a second.. sorta like a hiccup. But it plays nice.\n\nAgain, this works on my W7 64bit, Quad Core... results may vary on other systems.\n\nHope this helped at least ONE person so that they may enjoy this classic!!","April 25, 2014","true","5.9"," 44 of 53 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","44","53","0","0"

I must have sunk 1000+ hours into it back on my PS2. It was one of the games that was released with PS2 and I got it the same day I got my PS2 ((And I picked up The Bouncer that day as well)). So much content for an older game. The depth in the story and ability to control your own fate with your actions.\n\nMany of times have I lost track of the days (and missed school) because of this title. I still have one of my original playthroughs with over 700 hours just on that one file on my PS2 memory card ((remember those)).\n\nIf you are looking for a game that has more story then a game of its time would be expected of, alot of side quests, good loot system, tons of ways to customize you're character and you're party to whatever playstyle and class build that you want you're group to consist of, and a storyline that will have you pulling out you're teeth for more. With a good ammount of replay value. And different endings. Then this is a game you should take the time to try.\n\nIts alot cheaper then what I paid for it originally. So if you buy it and dont like it ((to each their own)) you lost out on what would be a pack of cigarettes or can of monster/redbull.\n\nThis is just a great game with what was a newer combat system ((unless you played StarOcean)) for its time. I also own the second Summoner title for PS2 as well But insted of summoning you became the summoned creature. And it is not a continued story. So this one as well as the second title kind of have there own standalone style of gameplay and story.\n\nIn this one you can summon monster to battle with you rather then becoming the summon. ((I personally liked the first one more then the second title)). Beat them both multible times. And would do so again. I hope you get as much enjoyment out of it as I do.","November 5, 2015","true","0.5"," 22 of 24 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","22","24","0","1"

It was made for both the ps2 and the PC. Made by violition and THQ it had small but decent studio's working on it. The story was really what made this game what it was beecause it sure as hell wasn't the graphics. The game has an amazing story and rich lore. The combat is turn based on the level of dragon age origions but with four different companions to switch around at max it gives you plenty to think about before your turn is even up. The four companions all have rich stories as well. Graphics are smeh at best, remember this was a ps2/old PC game and so it didn't have the best graphics. Sound is usually good, the music on all the different levels and world random encounters you have is amazing and it really gets you into the game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cherry__/recommended/275570/","cherry__","Cherry","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cherry__/","320 products in account","**Fair warning, this game was developed with the PS2 in mind, the PC version doesn't control as well and sometimes camera panning doesn't work. Same with a few nonconsequential interactions. Also there is, to my knowlege, no way to enable gamepad support.\n\nThe story of this game revolves around a young boy named Joseph, who was born with the mark of the summoner. When raiders descended upon his childhood village, he summoned a beast from his ring to fight off the invaders, but he was too weak to control it, so it slaughtered everyone except for those who could escape. Out of his disgust of his power and his inability to control it, he threw the ring down a well and exiled himself, only to have a foreign military attack his new village in search of him, thus leading him on a quest to find his old mentor and reluctantly get involved in the world's events.\n\nThe combat consists of left clicking on a target, and waiting a bit. You could cast a spell then open a menu to cancel the spell's start up if you want more hands on, or you can manually chain your attacks as well, tho there's little reason to until you get to a certain point.\n\nThe party you get is only 4 members plus one summon. The members you get are just a standard main-hero jack of trades, a rouge, a spell caster, and a warrior-- Pretty standard. But how the game handles summons is more interesting. Only the main character can Summon, and he has to wear a ring to do so (thus giving up a slot for bonus stats). Also if he gets downed after summoning, the summon goes rogue and you must kill it before you can summon again without leaving the area, but beyond that, summons are permanent until you reach a new area, it dies, or you banish it. Beyond that, you can jump in between control of your characters and even move them around individually (which is required for a few parts of the game), though beyond that, there is not much else.\n\nThe lore is the strongest part of this game, where every NPC has something to say, either it be some snippet about their daily life or how the nations are interacting with each other. There is even a whole religion you can learn about and you can find how skeptical other people may be of it. There's not a whole lot I can say without spoilers or just saying things, just if you like talking to NPCs, there is certainly a lot to be found here.\n\nFor voice quality, this IS an early 2000 game. The voice acting is okay, but there are repeated lines and sound effects galore. Like every time Joseph levels up, he says "I grow more powerful." in the most dead-panned way, and there are only so many times you can hear the same grunt sound over and over. I have a tolerance to these kind of things, so I wasn't bothered too much, others may be though.\n\nThe music in this game is overall down to preference. It has a very 2000s feel to it, but the soundtrack services this game just fine, although the first city's theme may wear thin after a while because it's constantly retarting from going between area and area a lot, and also you may be there for a few hours if you side-quest, and being stuck in large areas just has the songs drone on. However, the game does have individual sound sliders, so you can just mute the music and play your own.\n\nBack in the day, Summoner was an unrecognized game that was very good for what it had. It's still true today, but how the game aged may turn some people off from it. This is a game that doesn't push any boundaries by any modern means. However, it is still worth checking out if you enjoy stories.","November 9, 2014","true","6.1"," 20 of 22 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","20","22","0","0"

It was rare for him to buy these things, moreso to actually read through them or even install something from the cd. But when I came home from school one of these days, there he was, telling me that he installed this awesome demo where you could walk in the city and there were even rats and shopkeepers and stuff. So I tried it, and I was eternally captured. Was it the design or the great and original music? I kept replaying the demo over and over again. Months went by, it was december, and we stumbled upon the full version in a supermarket. I will never forget the shade of that green box. My parents told me we couldn't afford it and I understood that, but I cried like a little ♥♥♥♥♥ when I got it for Christmas. Still got the original cds, but the beautiful green box is lost because I kept carrying it everywhere with me like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥. I will be thinking of this game on my deathbed.\n[END OF NOSTALGIA]\n\n\nGame settings, loreSummoner is a dark fantasy RPG with an amazing lore. The story itself is extraordinary, but all the cities and mountains and forests are filled with little stories that actually hold together and give the world a subtle, enchanting atmosphere: Masad, a burnt down village where the game begins. Lenele, City of Gods, where people fear the upcoming war and where strange noises come out of the sewers. Iona, a secluded monastery built on the carcass of a gigantic god whose body turned into deep catacombs. Khosani kingdom hidden in the mountain; Tower of Eleh, built to reach the sky. You visit all these and many more locations, none of which are empty or dead, as some Summoner reviews on the web say.\n\nBalance issuesThe game is built around singleplayer experience and as such, it doesn't focus on balance. You may notice these little balance twitches after few playthroughs: e.g. most enemies are resistant against sword attacks. And who the hell would level up anything but sword mastery? If you don't know this, you may have a hard time, especially when facing some bosses and during the Tower of Eleh solo run.\n\nThe combat system, skillsThe combat system is the only thing I was always unsure about: you click an enemy, you start attacking him. No adrenaline rush. During your attack, you have a chance to prove your professional gaming skill and chain into more attacks by pressing RMB when a chain symbol appears over your head (it gets progressively harder). You can let the game chain the attacks for you by ticking an option in the game settings (don't ask me). Aside from autoattacking an enemy to death, you can cast a decent amount of spells - if that is what you want your character to learn, because it's impossible to learn all the skills on one hero. Summoner is not about plain skill, it's about planning your characters and employing some tactics in a wider perspective. The game is SLOW PACED. Especially if you summon the stone golem (DON'T EVER SUMMON THAT FAT ♥♥♥♥, YOU WILL LOSE FIVE MINUTES OF YOUR LIFE FOR NOTHING).\n\n\nObjectively, Summoner hasn't aged well. It could use texture updates or voice acting and some technical tweaks (resolution, running on fast rigs etc). Just watch some gameplay videos and try it out for yourself, if you feel like it.\n\nI will always love this game and all the people that worked on it.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vnwlw5r_zDU","December 2, 2014","true","10.1"," 15 of 15 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","15","15","3","0"

You get to summon quite a vast array of different minions to fight along side you, like a hulking minotaur or a spell flinging imp depending on your preference.\n\nIt's very surprising how catchy the music gets at points where it starts out atmospheric then suddenly goes nuts with some very fitting tune.  The game is a party based rpg where you can pause any time to issue orders like Baldurs gate.  I feel that this sort of gameplay fits pc's much better then a console controller would.  Anyways, if your looking for a fun mature game this will definitely hold up after you get used to the dated graphics.","January 30, 2015","true","42.2"," 18 of 21 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","18","21","0","1"

Yes, the graphics are old school, and the controls (for the PC version) could be tricky but you can play this game as a point-and-click if you really want to. True also that there's no "quest markers" or HUD, forcing you to remember where all those pesky little NPCs are if you want to complete the side quests, but for me that is part of it's charm. It's a great RPG, fantastic storyline, and it's not going to be over-and-done in just a few hours.\n\nSummoner is a over-looked yet compelling game, a wonderful adventure. If you've played before, you'll have the fun of rediscovering an old friend. If you haven't, then get this game and get stuck in!","March 19, 2014","true","16.6"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

It may not look like much now with dated graphics, but I'd still recommend it to anyone who likes some older games that never really got the spotlight they deserved. If they ever release Summoner 2 on steam I would recommend that one too. It's too bad they never made more than 2.\n\nThe gameplay reminds me a little of Final Fantasy 12 or Knights of the Old Republic. You can have the active party follow along while controlling one character and letting the AI handle the rest, switch between them, or even have the party wait while you wander around solo assassinating things in stealth.\n\nSummoner is really underrated and worth checking out.","September 1, 2014","true","1.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I had it when it first came out and i was very young and did not quite understand how it worked but i used to watch my sister play. it has recently be re-released on steam and i decided to give it a try and for a price tag of 4.99$ why not?\n\nThe story is about a man named the joseph born with the mark of the summoner, Through the use of magical rings, Summoners have the power to call forth demons and control them .However, to the north in Orenia is the Emperor Murod, a powerful sorcerer who wants Joseph dead.  With his unworldly powers, Murod\nlaunches a campaign whose sole purpose is to find Joseph.  When Murod's\nforces reach Joseph's home of Masad our story begins.\n\nThe gameplay is similar to dragon age and other tactical/turn based games, u can pause time mid comabt and  que your teams actions then unpause, so u have more control over whats happening when rather then panicin tryin to control upto 5 character in the middle of live combat. Also the game is very challengin by having to read dialogue rather then look for a flashing icon on your map of where to go and exactly what to do. no mini map icons makes u remember where certain shops and nps were.\n\nThere is voice acting for all cutscenes and the graphics are still barable for being 14 years old. the music is very good as it captures the dark time perfectly.\n\n\ni highly recommend this game to anyone who likes dragon age and other tactical rpgs, if you can bare the dated graphics the great story, rpg elements, and music will provide you for a very enjoyable experience","March 23, 2014","true","31.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

The graphics are a bit old and you need to get used to it at the start but i didnt mind much. I wanted to learn more about the story so i read every text and explored everything the game had to offer, i found collecting all the armour/summons (highly recomend a guide for that) and doing all the side quests quite satisfying, if you do that you have a good 35-40 hours on it which is quite good for the price.\n\nThere are 2 things i dont like about this game. The first is that you got 2 big continents which only have a few area's where you can actually do stuff like towns or dungeons. I found myself wandering around the world for quite some time while finding no spots at all that actually have content. The first continent has 5 spots you can go to (Towns and dungeons) but there is room for alteast 20 (not kidding) and stil have enough open world left.\nThe thing probably is that there was no money left to fill in the hole's which is a shame, could have been more.\n\nThe second one is that every time you get a cut scene (which is mostly before a boss fight) the game speed increases twice as much then before, not only is this verry annoying some boss fights are already really tough to manage without this bugg, with it you get yourself in situations that your a few seconds in a Boss fight and you see one friendly party member already on 10% HP.\n\nThe trick for this bug is to save the game and then load (doesnt work much in a boss fight) or everytime the game needs to load when you go to a different area it usually gets back to normal.\n\nAnyway had a lot of fun with this game, i would give it a 7/10. Reason for this is all the things i said before and because they put alot of effort in the game with trying to make it feel like a epic journey, which worked out.\n\n","May 20, 2014","true","34.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Only way i know how to describe it. You point the person you want to stab and then you wait for your person to hopefully outstab the enemy. Also the GUI makes it difficult to click on the enemy in the first place, so you will often get hit before you can hit back.\n\nCamera and movement are also a very large problem, you move by using your mouse to point on the ground where you want to go. This would normally be fine, but the camera just does not give you the option to path your characters movement more than a few steps. Be ready to have to halt your movement so you can move the camera to see where you are going and then go on your merry way again for a few steps before rinsing and repeating.\n\nQuest tracking is terrible. Just.............terrible. Each quest is logged just fine. They even give you a little description of who you got the quest from and where you can find them. However, as you advance some quests, you get new information. Better have a pen handy, because any additional information will NOT be finding its way into the quest descriptions. Also half the quests have you hunting down people in the HUGE city hub (which has over 4 chunks to trudge endlessly through). Again, pen and paper so you remember the locations of all the people of interst.\n\nThe map is also just awful. You can pull up your map and it will show you where you are and a little around you. Thats it. You cant zoom out, so you only get a little chunk right around where you are standing. Not only that, but the map lists absolutely NOTHING on it. Its just a graphic of the enviroment around you. No merchant locations, no points of interest, just nothing.\n\nBottom line here is that it is a dated game that makes me so unbelievably greatful for the wonderful maps, quest tracking, camera etc of modern gaming. I like to believe that games were never this bad, but then again maybe we just live in spoiled times today. I can see no reason anyone would want this game, it just has nothing to offer.","January 19","false","2.3"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

But, as can be expected from such a selection, it's kind of a crapshoot as to whether or not the game will be any good.\n\nIn this case, not so much. While I didn't play enough to put much judgement on the plot, the controls are simply a mess. The game plays a bit like Runescape classic, where you move by clicking on your intended destination, and combat consists of clicking on an enemy and waiting to see who falls down first. Dull, but servicable and open to improvement as the game progresses. Honestly, the thing that really killed my interest was the camera, which only moves - slowly - by holding your mouse to the edge of the screen and waiting as it rotates. When the game is as willing to make you wander around tangled back alleys as this, this makes simple exploration an irritating chore.\n\nThat, along with the complete lack of waypoints in large, visually undistinctive city maps, was what made me quit an hour in instead of continuing to slowly wander around trying to find which of the 270 nondescript NPCs sold armor I can actually wear, let alone trying to find the actual direction of the plot when the opening level was so obtuse I managed to kill every single enemy on the wide-open map before finally tripping over the exit.\n\nMaybe people more used to this genre of game might get more mileage out of Summoner, but me I just found it too tedious to keep going.","November 27, 2015","false","1.0"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","5"

Combat is mostly back and forth timed attacks with you cast/using abilities similar to Neverwinter Nights or Baldur's Gate except that there is one "chain" mechanic that lets you do special bonus attacks if you right click exactly when the blow lands. The mechanic is surprisingly deep as you gain new bonus attacks each different party member gets different ones (though some are shared). Characters are built via skill points which you pump into things like "fire" for fire magic or "sword" to up hit chance for sword weapons, each person gets predetermined skill sets which appear as they level so while there is some customization it is limited. The major draw here is the ability of the main character to summon one monster party member which is as cool as it sounds, really I wish I could just ditch the 3 other npcs and go full monster party. All the summonable monsters are unique with different traits and skills you can switch them out depending upon what kind of enemies you face. One flaw with the monster summons is no ability to set their AI.\n\nThis game does have its share or problems: no mini map notes, large empty areas, no fast travel, poor AI, respawning enemies, linear story. The combat can be fun but all the tedious traveling and looking for merchants or quest npcs or having a side quest completely disappear because you advanced the main story without any indication before hand leads to lots of fustraition. Additionally because of the enemies respawning its very annoying getting from point A to point B on top of which you cannot leave non-random encounter zones while under attack and with your party members all nearby. The game also starts slow with you lacking your "Summoner" skill till a hour or so in but if can handle the flaws you'll find a game worth playing.","April 5, 2015","true","43.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dsb123/recommended/275570/","dsb123","A Red-Letter Day","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dsb123/","114 products in account","Curator-esque Review\nSummoner is a single player, third person RPG that is reminiscent of the Dragon Age series in terms of gameplay.  The story is told mostly through text windows and the game is not very difficult once you learn how to play it.  Get this title on sale if you enjoy older RPG's with original stories, simple mechanics, and minimal inventory management.\n\nSummoner Review\nStory\n\nThe story of Summoner is rather complicated.  Playing through it means lots of reading with the occasional cutscene providing exposition.  To briefly summarize: players take on the role of Joseph, a farmer living in the kingdom of Medeva.  In his youth, soldiers attacked Joseph's home village.  During the pillaging, Joseph manages to summon a demon, which not only destroyed the attackers but also the village and nearly eveyone in it.  As one of the few survivors, Joseph left his town ostracized but eventually meets a man named Yago who helps Joseph learn about his true identity.  Many years have passed since then and the game begins in the village of Masad, where Joseph is currently working.  From the northern kingdom of Orenia, the army of the Emperor Murod invades Medeva in search of a very important person.  Joseph fights his way out of Masad and heads to Lenele, the capital of Medeva where Yago is currently residing as an assistant to King Bellias.  Once in Lenele, Joseph's true quest begins as he meets colorful characters who join him and help him to understand his past.\n\nGameplay\n\nAs I said above, Summoner is quite similar to the Dragon Age games in terms of it's gameplay.  You have to talk to people to recieve quests and information.  Most quest givers are found in the main cities but if you explore levels, you often find quest givers hiding in obscure places.  There is no morality system but in several quests you have the option of choosing different dialogue lines that can merely alter quest rewards.  In other words, you almost never see the outcome of completing a quest a certain way (aside from the main quest), you just receive a different reward.  Loot in Summoner is actually one of the main reasons to complete sidequests, since certain side quests will give you powerful weapons that you will use for a long time.  Of course, you can still buy everything from potions to armor from merchants but everything in Summoner is very expensive, especially in the early game.  I recommending grinding random encounters for a bit early on, not just to improve your stats but to also collect a bunch of junk to sell.  Most of the quests are of the fetch variety but there are a few that standout.\n\nCombat in Summoner is a hybrid of real-time and turn-based.  Once you are seen by an enemy, they will automatically engage your party and you will trade blows back and forth automatically until you or the enemy is dead.  Your party consists of four members (some of which have overlapping skills) and an optional fifth in the form a "Summon", a creature that only Jospeh can call forth.  You can pause the game at any time during combat and issue the next command you'd like each party member to execute as well as use items, switch gear, choose targets for spells, etc.  When combat is occurring and you control a melee character, you can chain together attacks with the press of a button, extending your "turn" until you break the chain.  It's sort of like playing a rhythmn game: pressing the chain button at the right pace unleashes bonus damage and special effects as you learn more chain abilities.  You can only control one party member at a time with the other party members operating on an AI routine that you can set in the character attributes screen.  Giving a bow to your thief character?  Set her to "Ranged" and she will engage enemies from afar instead of getting close.  Want your mage to focus on healing? Set her to "Healer" and she will only cast spells to heal party members when they go below a certain threshold.  This ability to choose how your party members behave is very nice becuase it allows you to instantly change a characters speciality if you need to.  And you will need to,  hint, hint , in my experience at least.  That being said, the AI sometimes behaves erratically, such as targeting unintended enemies, not casting the most useful spell, or getting stuck on the environment.  There is a lot of micromanagement in the late game, requiring you to constantly switch characters to cast hero specific abilities.  I advise making at least one character strong in "Heal" and "Holy" spells for increased party survivabilty.  As Joseph acquires certaing rings, he is able to summon a fifth party member known as a "Summon".  Summons all have their own unique look and abilities and knowing the weaknesses of your current enemy allows you to bring forth a summon that counterracts their strengths.\n\nWhile loot can be acquired through completing quests, great loot can also be found if you take the time to look around.  Seriously, scour every corner because loot is literally just sitting on the ground waiting to be found.  Most of your exploration will be easy though there are a few segments in the game where you can only use one or two party members for plot reasons.  There are a few sequences where you can only use the thief character for example.  The only part of the game that bothered me was a segment beyond halfway through the main quest where you must trek through a haunted forest while poisoned.  The only way to cure the poison is to reach the end of the level, requiring a lenghty slog through enemies and a boss fight you may or may not see coming, all the while constantly spamming party buff and heal spells as everyones' health constantly depletes.  The level felt too long and really killed the pace in my opinion but I made it through.  Backtracking is also something that you will do a lot of in Summoner and certain areas are also reused albeit with a different aesthetic for the most part.  This did not bother me however as there was always new loot to find.\n\nDesign\n\nAt first glance, you may not believe Summoner was a PS2 launch title but it was.  It has not aged well but I assume you are not buying this game for it's looks.  Environmental textures are simple, characters are jagged, and animations are stiff.  But, each piece of gear looks different and even stays on you during cutscenes.  Spells and abilities all have unique sounds and partical effects.  The voice acting is nothing to write home about but it gets the job done.  You will be reading most of the story anyway so thank goodness the text is humorous and serious at the right times.  Sounds all have a canned feel to them but some are custom and fit well with the what is happening on screen.  I think this the first game I've played where the music does not fit the setting of the game but still works great anyway.  There are definitely some hummable tracks here and a few that remind me of Deus Ex for some reason.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nAt around forty hours for a first playthrough, Summoner provided more value to me than I thought it would.  While it's age and backtracking in the game are certainly hurdles potential buyers should consider, Summoner feels like a very casual RPG that is not too difficult to complete and does not last longer than it needs to.  The game's mechanics and inventroy system are simple and the graphics are too but it tells a compelling and original story none the less.  If you can look past the age of the game, you will find an RPG that may be more entertaining than you thought it would be.","December 24, 2015","true","40.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
