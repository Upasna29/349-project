Blocks spawn at the back of the arena and slowly move towards you.  You destroy them with bouncing balls and powerups until a block makes it to your side.  Then the game is over.  There's strategy in how you save and use the powerups, and skill in juggling and aiming the many balls.\n\nThe suprise for me was PvP multiplayer, where it plays like VR Pong.  There are no powerups or blocks, just returning the ball back and forth as it becomes faster and faster.  It sounds simple, and it is, but being face to face in VR with your opponent brings so much to the game.  It's an absolute blast.  Shoutout to Shaquille who beat me easily 5 games straight.\n\nCyberpong will have you moving all around the required play area, but it doesn't push you to swing with the same vigor that HoloBall does.  I've had to take a break for a few days from HoloBall for my arm to recover.  Cyberpong brings my pulse up, but doesn't wear me out.\n\nTL;DR: While Cyberpong VR and HoloBall look similar, they play very differently, and both are great fun.  The online multiplayer in Cyberpong VR is an absolute must try.","April 28","true","4.0"," 33 of 35 people (94%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","94","33","35","3","2"

Well, here're my thoughts as someone who owns both:\n\n\n**NOTE: The following paragraph no longer applies; the Cyberpong team quickly changed the mechanics of the game to allow for smashing and controling the ball to a much, much greater extent.  You don't have to, but you can speed up the pace of the game quite significantly if you do.\n\nHoloball responds to how you hit the ball more than Cyberpong.  Holoball really is more like raquetball, and if you're looking for that smash-hit feeling, then Holoball is what you want.  For me, smashing it ends up straining my elbow after a short play-time, and I start feeling it there before actually working up a sweat.\n\n\n\nCyberpong is more polished, period.  The powerups, the tetris-meets-breakout singleplayer mode, the various characters that have different paddles (although, let's be real here - the default paddle is the best paddle), all of that just makes for a more fleshed-out game.  I played through Holoball and was done with it after about an hour.  I'm still playing single player Cyberpong trying to best my highest time.\n\nAnd finally, multiplayer.  I'm reserving my judgement until I see what the Holoball team does, but suffice it to say that this is the main selling point for Cyberpong right now.  It lags a bit, but only the interactions between the ball and the other player.  You never have a problem making contact with the ball (i.e. the ball never lags through your hand or anything).  It's incredibly simple - just barebones pong against another person - but that's all it needs to be.  Facing off against another human being who can wave to you, taunt a bit, sympathize when something crazy happens.  You feel the company, and it's fantastic.\n\nAll in all, I'd recommend this over Holoball as of right now.","April 29","true","5.7"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

That is, until I played Cyberpong VR.\n\nCyberpong VR's gameplay is exciting and makes for great competition. Its single-player is fun and easy to dive into and play, albeit short-lived due to a lack of progression or Story Mode. Where the game truly shines is in multiplayer where you face off with an opponent in a Pong style duel. There aren't many muliplayer VR games currently available, and this one was executed in a great manner. Seeing the body language of your opponent will make you excited for what's to come in the future of VR.\n\nAdditionally, unlike many virtual reality titles currently available, Cyberpong VR is priced affordably. It's a great pick-up for a new HTC Vive owner.\n\nYou can read my full review here:\nhttp://www.gamerevolution.com/review/cyberpong-vr","April 29","true","1.0"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","7","7","2","0"

This is not a pong game -- it's not even close to what Holoball is trying to do (other than the fact that the game happens to involve a ball).  If this game were named Cyberarkanoid VR, or Cyberbreakout VR, or anything other than containing the word 'pong,' I feel like there would be less unfortunate comparison with something it's not.\n\nIn any case, this game is super fun, and a compelling little arcade blockbreaker.  The force feedback of the paddles is well-implemented, and the later stages of the game get good and frantic.  I find myself wishing for more single-player modes, but the one mode it has is really good.  I've demoed it to a couple folks as a room-scale experience and everybody has liked it a lot.","May 1","true","2.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/classicgamernl/recommended/462000/","classicgamernl","ClassicGamerNL","http://steamcommunity.com/id/classicgamernl/","763 products in account","Cyber Pong VR is a retro styled modern pong game for the HTC Vive. The two Vive controllers are transformed into two paddles which you use to hit the ball. It is your task to use the ball to destroy the blocks before they get to close to the grid. If things get to hard, you can transform you peddles into special weapons like a gun, grabber or a bigger peddle.\nAll blocks have their own special abilities. The purple ones throw an orbs towards you, green blocks give an extra ball and the red blocks will explode. You can give the ball direction by curving your paddles. The harder you hit the ball the faster it will go.\nThe gameplay feels very natural and the visualization in the game is very clear and stylish. There isn´t a big learning curve, although I recommend playing the tutorial first. In the tutorial you´ll learn about the colored blocks and how you can use the special weapons. You´ll have to move your\nIn the single player mode, you can drill your skills. If you hold on long enough you will earn a place at the online and local leaderboard. The longer you can keep the blocks away, the higher you’ll rank.\nThe best thing about Cyber Pong VR is the multiplayer option, although finding an online competitor in these early days of VR can be quite difficult. The developers have well-conceived, since there is a small mini game available while you’re waiting. There is also a LAN option available for those who like to compete in the same room.\nThe game offers a really small learning curve and after playing for about five minutes I was fully immerged into the virtual environment. After ten minutes I started to get the hang of it and that motived to move quicker, dive for the ball, run around and really put some effort into getting a good high score.\nCyber Pong VR is a game that can be played endlessly and stays entertaining every time you start playing it. You can compare it a bit like the original Pong, Breakout and Tetris from the 70s, 80s and 90s, these games are still fun to play as well. Big difference with this one is that I´m exhausted after playing for longer than an hour. Great fun and exercise at the same time! Now I only need to get myself a waterproof VR Cover.\nhttps://youtu.be/ewAByailxrc\n","May 30","true","1.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Holoball had released earlier, and I really like that game. HB is closer to actual Pong in VR, while Cyberpong VR is basically a VR breakout.\n\nI'll be blunt; I found the game boring after about ten minutes. I jumped right in and had no idea what I was doing; everything was moving really slow and it was actually a bit frustrating. I jumped back out and played through the tutorial and learned about the different weapon types and energy and all that jazz. Basically you can make your paddle bigger and shoot some boxes with different ammunition; nothing revolutionary, just a new take on 3D breakout in VR.\n\nThe problem with this though, is even when I had 4+ balls in play, the game was just boring. The balls come at you slow, the 'hallway' in where the blocks are is very narrow and limited (I have a large room) which makes the balls bounce odd ways; this makes for awkward hits on the ball in awkward positions that are more frustrating then fun. They also come very slowly; I assume as the game speeds on they get quicker as they did in multiplayer, but I didn't even want to play that long to find out quite honestly.\n\nWhich brings me to my next point, multiplayer. I played two games against he same opponent, and he was definitely already experienced in the game. That wasn't the problem though; because the space we were in/hallway we were hitting back and forth in was so small, he could reach pretty close to my field by walking ahead. This allowed him to put his hands right in front of the ball spawn and block the ball, hitting it quickly back towards him then towards me not allowing me to get the first swing or be ready for the hit. Not to mention the connection was laggy, so I assume it is client hosted which presented other problems in that my hits did not feel 1:1 with the ball and watching the opponent hit it was slightly off too. Another thing - when you walk outside of the specific area it wants you to stand in, the screen just goes black. That's disorienting and feels very lazy to me.\n\nThe game looks good graphically, and unfortunately that is all I can see being really positive about it. I guess I was spoiled by Holoball, which is fast paced and uses all of my room and is an actual take on Pong in VR, but Cyberpong VR did not live up to what I thought it might be from the name and multiplayer features that I saw when it first caught me eye.","April 29","false","0.3"," 6 of 16 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","6","16","0","5"
