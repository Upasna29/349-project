"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gradation/recommended/446330/","gradation","Radian","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gradation/","264 products in account","This game is a sequel to a by-battle, choose your own adventure text-based adventure akin to your choice of an Napoleon-era romp, Choice of the Broadsides, Horatio Hornblower, etc, with nearly non-existent magic. Guns of Infinity improves over Sabres of Infinity in the following ways: it provides a more dynamic experience, with diverting or flavorful mini-storylines, new characters and romances, and considerably more nuance.\n\nThe first game, Sabres of Infinity, was largely a linear experience. You went from one battle to the next, with two chapter changes if you didn't make promotion. Guns of the Infinity follows your substantial decisions, writing four chapter changes (8 unique choices) for their divergences. If you retreated in the last game, you have a whole unique arc.\n\nBut this can also result in brevity. The game is long, but unless you replay or read the scenes, you won't see all the stops.\n\nTo help with replayability, the author has provided some flavor-enhancing storylines. This include a family, selective pasttimes and causes. But there are some caveats. Your family, in theory, provides more Austen sensibility, but with the amount of choices over your siblings, mother and father, effectively reduces to a money-bleeding vanity. Some decisions, like beatifying an old officer, do not show their full effect in the game.\n\nThe stronger additions are the romances. (When I replayed Sabres, I combed the choices for nearly an hour, before I realized the war-time romance was in Broadsides.) Your choices include an Adlerian spy filly and a fur-lined Duchess. (It looks like there was plans for knights-and-idealism Elson, but not moody-venerable-bryonic-hero Sir Cassius.) One note of caution though: only the spy has the full arc.\n\nGuns still has a small cast like the first game. This is both detrimental and advantageous. In Sabres, you focused nearly entirely on your two friends/rivals/distant chums. This resulted in two strong characters. But I had no idea what my second-in-command did during the day. (Probably slept until I woke him up like Alfred.) The newcomers have more plans and preferences and ideas (and more importantly investments!)\n\nThe strongest is the spy. So if you do want to romance her, remember that there isn't much recourse in romance after the first (your character's plans for her) choice. It is easier to break up than choose intellectually and fall in love later, or go from friendship to love.\n\nFlavor and love-at-first-sight decisions notwithstanding, Guns excells in its nuances. In Sabres, it was guns blazing into the quiet sun. Guns plays like Empire to a New Hope. Your commanders express their weariness at the loss of war more often. You get more inner dialogue.\n\nTo people familiar with war novels, the diatribe between the romance and cynicism of war may seem old hash. But the only way this story works is in its sense of time. This story is part 2, of a long campaign, and game. Whether your character goes for the war is hell mantra, or God save the King, is irrelevant. You make choices to a changing and growing world. Some choices are meaningless, a few vital, and others numbing in their repetition, (didn't I already make Theoden's charge?) but they are all cumulative.\n\nWars are made by the composite of many, many events, not any one shot.\n\nYour decision to play this game is by the sum of all parts.","March 31","true","3.1"," 18 of 18 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","18","18","2","0"

There a lot gradual developments in story and characters, nothing is left half-baked. Gives a sense of satisfaction when our choices make an impact even in long term. But I do have difficulty in knowing where we stand in matter of relationships. Like I tried courting then there a another guy then what. Very vague. No clear indication of relationship status or ,I didn't see it? A good game nevertheless with top notch writing. Highly recommended.\n\n9.5/10 Would try my best for victory and achieve it yet insulted or humiliated at every turning corner.","April 2","true","11.7"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","2"

I played the by-the-book man of honor, the war weary veteran who would stop at nothing to speed the conclusion of the war, and the national hero who falls helplessly in love. All are incredibly well written and realized, and the feeling that every decision matters is one that leaves you nervous every time you go to press 'next.'\n\nPlay the game multiple times. Try to find every path available to you. Each is radically different to it's fellows, and each is worthy of being followed through in it's entirety.\n\nTierra and Victory","April 6","true","10.2"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

This game is really good and your choices actually matter ALOT. I love it so much I might even make my own fanfiction/log diary for my character. Totally worth the $3 I paid for it and the $2 I paid for its prequel (Sabres of Infinity). I beat this game prior to Sabres and enjoyed it but was slightly confused but still made it perfectly with the pre-built characters.\n\nWas slightly disappointed my 60/70/70/90 stats were all reset to 50 when I imported my Sabres but not everything can be perfect haha.
