I remember this game from 1996 or 1997! Was stunning in this time. Graphics is really really retro for today standard and would need some remastering but if you like adventure games, good story and not caring much about GFX get this game.","June 13, 2014","true","7.5"," 26 of 31 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","26","31","0","0"

It's got clunky controls, and graphics fighting against Namco Museum on my PS1. But it's got one thing that not even modern games have. An immersive story. After about 10 minutes of figuring out the controlls, I was hooked again. I was too young to be able to get past the first few puzzels in 97, but now I can fully understand the complexity of the story and the true power an adventure game has in story telling.\n\nIt's a gripping narrative which is not only brooding but overlayed of two seemingly not-crossible genres, noire and science fiction. It gives you exactly what you ask for out of the crossing between the two, and does not dissapoint. Characters, albeit primitive in design, are complex. Characters change when connecting plot points together, something that video games as a whole have not been able to since preserve, which is a major tennant of any American film. It features both conspiracies and science in the same breath, and does not overstep the boundraies of which the game lays. It is firmly rooted and knows what it wants to deliver in terms of story, and does so devistatingly well.\n\nIt's never a race of who has the better graphics, but who can convey the best story, and Tex Murphy is top gun in my book.","June 16, 2014","true","9.5"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","16","17","0","0"

The graphics are pretty low-res by today's standards, and the controls are bit awkward at first, but if you can move past those things you will find fun adventure game that was clearly made with a lot of heart.","January 30, 2015","true","18.7"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","11","11","0","0"

PERIOD.\nTo understand this, you need to play several paths and get several endings, sure you mostly play the same puzzles but your choices actually MATTER. YOU decide how things play out. In 1996 this was totally unheard from (and with FMV no less!).\nSo get over the annoying controls (WASD was not invented yet), and enjoy a great story.\n","January 17","true","0.4"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","11","12","0","0"

For you old enough to remember the good old 486DX computer with the state of the art double speed CD rom reader; this was the game that break the mold with incredible 640 x 480 Full motion video on your DOS system. Plus you have the added bonus not having to change your config.sys file and autoexec.bat to get enough memory for the game on your current gaming rig! ^_^\n\nThe game is very simple compared to modern games, but oh heck, it is still as fun to play as it was 2 decades ago.","June 15, 2014","true","1.1"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","13","16","0","0"

BUT, this doesn't matter!!! It's a splendid game. It is difficult, it is intrigant, it is funny, it is a challenge for your mind.

Give it a try.\nI didn't get to play these games in the 90s, but I'd heard a lot about them so I started with this one.\n\nIn short, it's low-tech, it starts shakily and the controls are lousy BUT the warm humour and story really shine through and more than make up for its age and shortcomings.\n\nTex is a great character - one of many - and in addition to the humour and cheese this is ALSO a genuinely interesting sci-fi mystery/detective story.","April 1, 2015","true","28.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
