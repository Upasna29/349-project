I guess I was wrong, I like the story so far, it's basically one of those classic nice rpg games and for 14 cents you must get it. Sale ends in July 21 so grab it quick no reason to be cheap just sell some cards to get this, you'll easily get all those achievements in a couple of hours. Although those who are not really into old rpgs might not like this game because of it's style, graphics, etc.. I personally like the animations just reminds me of those classic rpgs with a nice story tied with it although the graphics aren't out of this world lol but that really doesn't stop you from having fun. But somethings could be improved like  the variety of monsters that spawn as well as items they drop and adding some sort of map or something that allows the player to get a sense of where they need to go. Overall it's a decent game and targets mostly those who like classic rpg games.","July 7, 2015","true","6.3"," 63 of 74 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","63","74","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/recommended/347560/","nerdhouse","Nerd House","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/","2628 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nTerra Incognita is a retro throwback RPG, hearkening back to the days of titles like Suikoden...which the developer has stated was a direct inspiration. As such, this puts somewhat of a large expectation on the game right off the bat, and after a few hours into the game, I can say that the expectations were met. There are a few small issues that I found hindered the game very slightly.  But these issues, like I said, are very small. The game is still pretty well designed, the writing is great, and the sprite work and animations are very well done.\n\nStory-wise, it's a neat concept, conveyed through well-written dialogue. No corners were cut here, and that's great. Most smaller titles similar to this game skimp out on a lot of details, which add up to put a huge damper on the experience. Not so with Terra Incognita. I don't want to go into too much detail, as it would spoil some of the story and intrigue. Let's just say that the story is well-written and cohesive, and very good.\n\nIf you have ever played Suikoden I or II, you will immediately recognize the art style used in Terra. While it's not exactly like it, it's similar enough and looks great. Every character has a unique and detailed sprite, which shows the love and care the developer put into the art of the game. Attack and movement animations are simple, but they work and look great.\n\nTerra uses a traditional turn-based battle system. Enemies are displayed on the left, while your party is displayed on the left. Typical status information for your party such as HP and MP is displayed in boxes at the bottom of the screen. During battle you get to choose from a list of actions for each party member: Attack, Magia (magic), Abilities, and Items. Once your actions are selected, each character performs the selected action one at a time until they are done, then the enemy performs their actions. This is repeated until one or the other party is defeated. In the case where your party is defeated, it is a game over. If the enemy is defeated, you are awarded money and experience points.\n\nMost gamers will be famililar with the system, as it's the tried-and-true battle system for *most* RPG's out today. This means that jumping right in shouldn't be a problem for many players, and long-time fans of the genre will have no issues at all getting in there and getting their hands dirty with the mechanics of the system.\n\nIf you are looking for a cheap, deeply inspiring RPG with lots to offer, I wholeheartedly recommended Terra Incognita. The price might seem low, and because of that some people might dismiss it as being a shallow title with nothing to offer. They couldn't be more wrong!\n\nRecommended\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","February 9, 2015","true","6.0"," 33 of 45 people (73%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","73","33","45","3","2"

Of course it is just a design choice by the developer and I appreciate the vision.\n\nOverall I feel that the response while controlling the character during exploration and battle are a bit unresponsive.\nIt is still a bit buggy during early access but it is playable and acceptable :)\n\nI really recommend this game for RPG lover.\n\n\n","June 11, 2015","true","3.5"," 36 of 52 people (69%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","69","36","52","2","0"

Once you're out of the first map though, the fragments of information begin to tell the story.\n\nSo far I've found a couple of non show-stopping bugs, which I've reported to the developer.\n\nAll in all it's nice nostalgic introduction to what will hopefully be a great story.

It's and ode of love to the old games and it has his flaws, but even so, it's a nice (and cheap) expirience.\n\nThe story is pretty cliche, but it has the enough potential to get better. And with this companions, I'm excited to see what adventures are waiting in the world of Terra. The combat is the typical trun based with three commands: Atack, Magic and Loot. Simple and effective. One remarkable thing that I love from the combat is that you can set "auras" to your character (like Fire aura) to improve it. It feels very cool when you're facing a boss, you start to buff yourself and then you defeat him with the body covered by a fire aura of destruction. It's just awesome.\n\nBut it has it's flaws. The biggest flaw is the exploration. The world it's too inert, you can't interact with it. For example, when you enter to Frann's house, you see all that cool stuff and you can't do anything. A simple "There is nothing special in here" in a box, or a shelf or a little reward like a piece of lore or something. Another annoying thing it's that the combats are too frequent, and doesn't let you explore. The archievements are too silly, I mean, I like to receive an archievement when i really do some great things, like kill a big ♥♥♥♥ing dragon or some ♥♥♥♥.\n\nThis is an early acces review, so when the final game comes out i will update this review.\n¡I'm hype for new content!\n\n(Tybalt it's too ♥♥♥♥ing overpowered)","September 14, 2015","true","3.4"," 17 of 21 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","17","21","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SilverSP/recommended/347560/","SilverSP","✌ince (Wilhelm#12191)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SilverSP/","96 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI don't really like Terra, and the frusturating thing is that I really should like it. But I don't.\n\nTerra Incognita (Unknown Land, I guess) is an Early Access RPG about the world of Terra and the Descendants who guard it. You start the game as Alexis, a Descendant who's fallen from the sky. He meets an archer fisher dude named Leon, who gives him food and shelter for a night, and the two of them head off to the mainland for... some reason. Anyway they reach a village called North Willow, which is under constant threat of bandit attacks, so the duo try to bring peace to the northern continent, gathering friends and equipment along the way.\n\nRight off the bat, there's a bunch of problems with the game - not related to even the story or gameplay, but the operational aspects of it. For some reason, you aren't able to alt+tab out of the game, there isn't a functional Steam Overlay, and (to me) the biggest issue is that it forces itself into fullscreen, regardless of the window size you pick. It was definitely a hassle to get started, but I let it slide and read the opening cinematics a few times (thanks to having to restart it over and over).\n\nBut as soon as I start controlling the game it starts to kinda show it's, well, Early Access. Not that I'm complaining, I mean, I knew the game was Early Access when I bought it. I'm pretty sure the whole game was made in RPG Maker - which isn't a bad thing, but considering the versatility of RPG Maker, I was surprised at how bare the gameplay was. The tile-based movement doesn't make a lot of sense when you have sprawling forests and tons of nooks and crannies to explore - it all felt really cramped or really open; there wasn't a place in the game I could describe otherwise. Worst thing is, I didn't know the controls - I did see a "controls" picture overlaid on screen at the beginning, but it apparently disappears by itself after a while and I had assumed it'd stay there until I did something.\n\nAs for the actual gameplay portion of the gameplay, it was kind of underwhelming. After you get all four party slots filled up, you can pretty much just start an encounter and spam enter for a while. HP/MP conservation isn't that much of a problem when leveling up (which happens often) and save stones (which are everywhere) restore all your health and mana. On the other hand, potions and items felt way too weak - considering most of the magic attacks took around 35~50 MP to cast, getting a "Blue Potion" which only restores 40 MP felt really underwhelming, especially when the game starts you with potions that heal for 500 HP.\n\nThe game also feels really handholdy in parts. "We have to go this way!" But do we really have to? I want to at least explore a little bit first. The fact that I didn't even get to see inside the ruins kind of bums me out. Some areas, though, you can return to later, which is alright. But the fact that the party (or "Battle team", as the game insists on using) went RIGHT back to town and didn't even let me blink after defeating Tybalt just kind of made me say "but, why?"\n\nI wouldn't even mind that so much if it weren't for the inconsistencies. Like when Alexis and Leon were climbing up the ruins, you could apparently only progress if you went around the left side. The right side of the ruins were, inexplicably, blocked off by an invisible wall. But they both went to the same section. I don't get why that happened; why not let me go either way?\n\nAlso, item balance doesn't really feel like it exists at all. Scroll that lets you summon a giant bone dragon when you're still in early-game? Sure, ok. But you have to pay like 500 GP to get a measly upgrade to an item which may or may not even be that much of an improvement. The fact that some items don't even reveal what they do is also kind of weird. Don't get too drunk? What does that mean? What if it's a bad thing and I used it on the last living guy on my party during a big boss fight? Or what if it's a really good thing but I wasted it on the last turn of a battle? Idk. LISA did item descriptions very well and also showed off the stat boosts pretty nicely, so use that for comparison if you need it. And LISA was also an RPG Maker game!\n\nDialogue and stuff felt really bad. It was really bad, actually, partly due to the unintuitive menus (seriously, a shop should not be a Choose Your Own Adventure-like dialogue tree) and partly due to the unpolished sentences. The fact that Brom's name inexplicably loses its capitalization when recruiting Frann just felt really... bad. And that's not the only issue, either. Random varying length of ellipses (from .. to ........), unnatural conversations (I do what I want!), and just a general feel of "Really? This is what we're doing? Okay." just kind of ruin the game as a whole for me. I cared more about the dialogue than I do the game itself and that's just not cool.\n\nAs for the general presentation of the game, I guess I could say it's better than a lot of the ways RPG Maker games present themselves. Customized character portraits, sprites, tilesets and music is definitely a step above the reused stock assets I see all the damn time. It looks nice. It IS nice. So props for that.\n\nI dunno. I really kinda want to be able to say "yes, this is worth buying!" But I honestly don't think it is in its current state. I do think Terra Incognita has the potential to improve so I'll be able to say that. But, again, I'm not sure if that's going to happen.\n\nOne more thing. Yes, I'm aware the game is Early Access. I don't believe in Early Access as a shield against all criticism (well it's a beta so you can't complain!!). I believe Early Access should be a way for players to genuinely give feedback to developers and other potential players, and that's why I'm writing this - I'd really like at least someone to see this and get a good idea of how the game is right now. Because overall, it's not something I'd recommend.

It's bland.\n-The animations are very minimal, even without the dead moments surrounding each one (Seriously. It just stops.) They lack any kind of feel or sense of motion or anything. There's no intensity or interest. A bit of a slow pace doesn't bother me, but there has to be something to make it worth while. They're bland.\n-The enemies and characters. An armoured fighter. A woodland hunter with a bow. Forest creatures and slimes. These aren't new. They aren't interesting. They're not good. They aren't bad, either. They're forgettable and bland.\n-Character shows up out of nowhere with amnesia. World has monsters that have increased in number and strength. Chosen warriors to face the looming threat. Watch your step, they've been breaking a lot of new ground around here.\n-The character interrupts you when you try to walk in a way you're not supposed to go. There's a perfectly open path. But you can't go. The game doesn't want you to though, you have to wait for it to let you. Sit down and eat your vegetables and then clean up your room, then you can play. There's a good little kid.\n-This is the dumbest complaint of all, but the first two playable characters have the same face and features, they face the same way in their portraits, they have a similar pose. It just looks they used the exact same template for both, and drew a beard on one.\n\nThis game is still in Early Access and this definitely seems like their maiden voyage into game development, so it should be accepted that there are going to be issues and it is mean of me to be so negative about and critical of people who want to pursue making video games. They should keep trying. But this really isn't worth playing or buying at this point. The battles are slow and more of an inconvenience than fun. The game railroads you from the start. The game stops when you do things. It's all cliché on the story front.

Many of you might be compelled to take different routes before heading where you're supposed to go. The game at times prevents you from doing that. "Hey, that's not the way to the village." (Yes, I know, but I just wanna check if there's good loots over on that area. Or if I might finally get a glimpse of the Loch Ness monster.)\n\n- No interaction with objects and landmarks. Most of us are a fan of mashing the Enter button while going through every single object in a room, hoping for loots, secret items, or even something interesting to read. This game gives you a huge world with barely anything of that sort.\n\n- No visual way of telling whether a location is accessible. When you get to a certain village in the beginning, you're supposed to rest for the night. They tell you to go back to your tent. You see 2 tents, but is not certain which one it is so you try both of them. The 1st tent looks to be open, but doesn't actually let you in. You press Enter hoping thinking it might let you in. Nothing. No dialog of any sort. "This is not my tent. I better check the one next to it."\n\n- Not much attention to detail. It just feels like many of the objects are placed for the sake of "filling the room" but serve no purpose.\n\nI set my standards pretty low before playing the game, but it seems like they missed some of the basic features that even an old RPG like Final Fantasy III was able to implement.\n\nI apologize for only listing what I thought are the "bad points" of the game. Don't get me wrong, this game has some good features that made me kept playing. I just listed what I felt was lacking or missing, in hopes that it may be addressed at some point in the future.

Does it have good aspects - in some areas, yes. The music is pretty great, though recognisable to anyone who knows the RM Community. The menu system is decent (though why you'd put usable items at the end of the list instead of the start when they're going to be accessed the most... quite questionable).\n\nThat said, it is full of spelling, grammar and punctuation errors. Which is a pity because aside from that the writing is one of the few strong points of the game. Bar a few instances of recycled information.\n\nMaps are for the most part bland, empty and boring - usually too big. They make no sense, especially the village of Window, uh, Willow - some of the inners are non-sensical, with houses being two tiles long but well over 30 inside, and others having T shaped inners and flat outers. Maps are too big, too dark when there's plenty of light sources. Light sources are also nonsensical, with shadows falling towards the light instead of away.\n\nI got stuck searching for a doughnut thief and could not trigger anyone talking about it, nor could I leave town. I talked to every person in the town. Nothing. Bug!\n\nThe battles were boring and button mash events bar one boss battle which was scaled towards being a tad too hard (mainly because your healing spell is not well balanced). While the monster graphics are cute and the idea of them looking different when they die is also neat, the battles just bored the hell out of me.\n\nAnd let's cut to the chase. This game is illegal.\n\nThe graphics are a mix of custom, edited and ripped resources. A lot of the character graphics come from the Suikoden series with decent to bad edits done to try and hide that fact. I'd recommend just playing the Suikoden series for yourselves - they're a lot better in all aspects. To the whole 'OMG we're not ripping' ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t the creators have gone out of their way to shout, let me ask one question - if you ain't using rips and edits, then why are your battle sprites facing away from the enemies? Because if they're not edits and rips you'd have drawn them to actually face the creatures that they're fighting, not the trees. Rips. Anyone can see that. The fact that you go out of your ways to try and hide any conversation that has popped up on the subject just screams the fact for all to see - that you are using edited rips and don't want people to know so you don't see a loss in sales due to doing the dirty. You have also tried to stop people from posting that by threatening lawsuits... which is hilarious since you know you'd lose straight off the bat due to your thievery.\n\nFrankly, I'll be getting a refund. It's not worth my .99 cents, even if the (stolen) cats are cute.\n\nIf you want to check it out, here's the first hour and a half: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CP95jkMBpTs\n\nSave yourself some money and go spend it on a game that's not full of ripped graphics and bad writing, mapping and battles.

Unhurt but loses all his memories, which is really spreading around video game main characters nowadays, having no memory of who he is other than his name. His name is Alexis, and with his new companion Leon goes on a journey to find out who he is, and to silence the strange voices in his head that keep telling him what to do. Terra Incognita ~ Chapter One: The Descendant is an Early Access Steam game, developed by Back to Basics gaming, which sets out to emulate the classic JRPGs. The name itself, translated from Latin, means “unknown land”, which is more than likely a reference to the strange, unknown land you've found yourself in.\n\nOne of the positive things about being an amnesiac is that you're figuring out the plot at the same time as Alexis is, as well as the controls. This loosely means that the small tutorial hints don't feel forced, because Alexis has no idea about what's going on, so when Leon talks to you about elemental weaknesses and Alexis asks more about. It doesn't make him that silly guy that didn't pay attention in training, he actually doesn't know. It's nicely integrated into the story's overall plot, which is a breath of fresh air considering how certain games can shove the tutorial down your throat.\n\nFull preview[www.noobfeed.com]","May 1, 2015","true","2.4"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

It was an insta-buy for me! With such high expectaions and the huge shoes of teenage nostalgia to fill I'm proud to say this game, even in Early Access, is passing with flying colors.\n\nStory: 10/10\nI love it. I don't want to ruin anything, but this one is going places. The dialogue in this game is exactly what makes me want to play an RPG. A lot of newer RPGs have so much mindless babbling of glossary terms that you don't want to memorize. Terra Incognita has the perfect amount of vocabulary, character customization, and immersion just like it's spiritual predecessors. This is only the first chapter and I definitely want to know the rest.\n\nGameplay: 9/10\nAnyone that's played a turn-based RPG will be familiar with the setup. It's almost just like the uniquely badass system from the Suikoden series -- you engage an enemy, choose your parties actions, attacks magic items oh my!, rinse, repeat. The amount of battles at this point is not overloading and I love a balanced experience that doesn't require farming to progress. There are a few hiccups in game mechanics, namely the lack of certain functions that I know will be polished before release.\n\nGraphics: 9/10\nThe pixel art is spot on. Aside from my love for pixel art it's very in tune with the soul of the game. It almost looks like it was ripped straight from it -- doesn't look exactly look like what you think it is, but you swear it looks just like it. That's one of my favorite parts about it. :D The character portraits are also a cool blend of modern American and Japanese animation styles. The only problem is right now you can't set the window resolution or fullscreen resolution.\n\nSound: 10/10\nThe music is, simply put, perfect. It immediately brings back the memories of playing endless hours on corded controllers. The arrangements are perfect and it seems to me like their using the same instrumentation, I'm not sure but regardless, boy does it sound good to my ears.\n\nOverall: 10/10This game has a lot of potential. For an Early Access title it has a few little user-unfriendly quirks that I hope are ironed out but it's definitely something to buy if you like RPGs or to at least watch out for when it's on sale to find that diamond in the rough for the future. For any true fan of 2D RPGs (Genesis/SNES/PSX titles alike) I'm positive you will enjoy this game. There needs to be more titles like this on Steam.","February 13, 2015","true","8.6"," 16 of 28 people (57%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","57","16","28","2","3"

I found myself enjoying the game more than I expected. Already 3 hours in and having a lot of fun.\n\nThere are tons of reasons to play this game if RPGs are your thing. I've seen quite a few games on steam like this but they are lazily executed.

I would absolutely pay the full (and still cheap!) EA price given the choice again.\n\nAs RPGs go, it's pretty standard form, but it plays smoothly and the story looks like it'll be pretty interesting.  Since I personally prefer turn-based combat (I like having time to think rather than just reacting), I find that old-school style very entertaining.\n\nMusic and sound are done nicely as are the graphics.  There are no voiceovers, at least so far, and that's just fine with me; I'd rather have no voice work at all rather than risk bad voice-actors.  Just my personal preference.\n\nAnyway, it's worth the buck to play if you like old-school RPGs.  And as I understand, investing in the EA gets you access to the whole finished game, which will be priced higher, so you save some money too.  If you like the game, this is a great bonus, and if you don't like it, you're still only out a dollar.

It's said the the Gods, at times like this, summon warriors called 'Descendants' down to Terra to restore balance. This is the story of one of these Descendants, Alexis. He falls from the sky, and is found by a man named Leon. From there, Leon and Alexis work together to make a band of heroes, and fight the Valganis family to restore peace in Terra!\n\nWhat kind of game is this: Terra Incognita is an RPG based in a fantasy world, similar to Dungeons and Dragons. In Terra Incognita, you form a team of heroes who fight the Valganis, demons, and monsters alike, who use Magia (magic) or strength to defeat you. This is very similar to the Internet Flash Game "Epic Battle Fantasy", with how you play.\n\nWhat I like: I like the RPG combat system. The game runs smoothly(except for a bug or two), and has a very interesting story! Also, I enjoy how the characters each have certian strengths and weaknesses, along with them having personalities, which is somewhat hard for any game. Along with this, I like how hard Back to Basics Gaming is working to make this enjoyable. They have been watching the Steam Community Forums of their games, and have been posting help to anyone possible!\n\nWhat I dislike: I dislike very little about this game. I mainly dislike how you can't access Kiln, and almost anywhere out of North Willow and a portion of the Wilderness outside of the town. I understand that this is early access, and that the game is still in beta, but I bought the game last night, and now, in the middle of the day, I have nothing to do in Terra but farm XP and Gold from monsters. Even though it isn't as bothering, and has only happened three times, I dont like how when fighting in the Wilderness, you have a chance of getting a crash because of an animation going wrong.\n\nFinal Thoughts: I would recommend buying this game now, even with the problems, while you have the time to purchase it for only 14 cents! It would also be cool to gift it to some to your friends, like I did, and get excited for Updates, and for Chapter Two!","July 9, 2015","true","9.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The story is nice, immersive, interesting, remembers me of the old school RPGs. Speaking of the game in a general aspect, everything goes fine, with the characters, the items, monsters, quests, etc... And that is the most important thing in a beta, but there are also, some details that have to be fixed, like some errors in the grammar ("somebody has joined the battle paty" for example) , or things that could be added, like a journal to take note and remember about the actual quests, a specified set of buttons for the controller (I had to guess how to use it), or even showing the items stats. Details like these are very important, and have to be worked with precision.\n\nWith all of this in mind, my rate for this game is a 9/10, being honest. The game goes fine, for being in beta, it's pretty good, and I'll be waiting for the next updates. There's a long way ahead, but I'm sure that this will go as fine as it started, or even better.

It's said the the Gods, at times like this, summon warriors called 'Descendants' down to Terra to restore balance. This is the story of one of these Descendants, Alexis. He falls from the sky, and is found by a man named Leon. From there, Leon and Alexis work together to make a band of heroes, and fight the Valganis family to restore peace in Terra!\n\nWhat kind of game is this: Terra Incognita is an RPG based in a fantasy world, similar to Dungeons and Dragons. In Terra Incognita, you form a team of heroes who fight the Valganis, demons, and monsters alike, who use Magia (magic) or strength to defeat you. This is very similar to the Internet Flash Game "Epic Battle Fantasy", with how you play.\n\nWhat I like: I like the RPG combat system. The game runs smoothly(except for a bug or two), and has a very interesting story! Also, I enjoy how the characters each have certian strengths and weaknesses, along with them having personalities, which is somewhat hard for any game. Along with this, I like how hard Back to Basics Gaming is working to make this enjoyable. They have been watching the Steam Community Forums of their games, and have been posting help to anyone possible!\n\nWhat I dislike: I dislike very little about this game. I mainly dislike how you can't access Kiln, and almost anywhere out of North Willow and a portion of the Wilderness outside of the town. I understand that this is early access, and that the game is still in beta, but I bought the game last night, and now, in the middle of the day, I have nothing to do in Terra but farm XP and Gold from monsters. Even though it isn't as bothering, and has only happened three times, I dont like how when fighting in the Wilderness, you have a chance of getting a crash because of an animation going wrong.\n\nFinal Thoughts: I would recommend buying this game now, even with the problems, while you have the time to purchase it for only 14 cents! It would also be cool to gift it to some to your friends, like I did, and get excited for Updates, and for Chapter Two!","July 9, 2015","true","9.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Great game and good story. Reminds me of an old Playstation type game. Suikoden games come to mind, which were some of the best games ever. Keep up the good work. Even though I have to start over because of the fixes, kinda sucks but that's Beta for ya. The game almost seems too easy sometimes. The boss fights are a little harder, but other than that it's easy to level your characters, even if aren't using all of them (they still level, which I thought was weird). Achievements come pretty easy also.\n\nIf you have extra cash in your Steam wallet, I would even pick it up for .99 cents. On sale, the same price of .14 cents is about the price of a Steam trading card.

It has a good story with pretty likeable characters, although their personalities feel rather underdeveloped. More depth to the characters' personalities would really help to make the story stronger, but this game is still in early access; I'm sure that more will be added to them as time goes by.  As for the graphics... they're subpar. The battle animations seem very limited (which is probably due to the game being in early access), and movement seems awkward. But, once again, the game is in early access, so this is rather minor. I am rather impressed by the music in the game - it really does help to set the tone of scenes and environments. Gameplay is your typical turn-based format with not much else to it. Some may be put off by this as it doesn't really contribute anything new to the world of RPGs, but, honestly, it doesn't bother me in the slighest; I like a simple RPG like this as it's easy to pick up and progress through the game.\n\nAlso, it's currently on sale at 14 cents. You can't go wrong with buying a game when you can sell the cards to break even :P\n\nWhile the game still needs some work, it's definitely a game that I'd recommend to someone who enjoys a good RPG. I hope to see more from this game as it continues to develop further as I am enjoying it so far.","July 7, 2015","true","5.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

I'm not entirely sure why it's early access considering the game is a story-driven RPG. Generally, early access games are either sandbox, puzzle, or shoot-em-up games; so having an RPG story as early access is a bit off-putting.\n\nI enjoy the game, but not some of the mechanics. The option menu only allows me to change the volume and switch between full screen and windowed. It doesn't allow me to change the text speed, which I really need. Honestly, the text feels laggy. For example, someone says something, *I hit z*, *pause*, person continues with text. It feels like someone is pulsing the brakes on the story every time that happens.\n\nThe battle screen also feels laggy. The animations of the battles can be buggy too. But the battles are really simple, which I can appreciate.\n\nThe music for the game is amazing as well. I really enjoy it and wouldn't mind having a soundtrack for it to put in my game music library!\n\nHonestly, tl;dr, this game is buggy and feels laggy. But with a little tender loving care, it will turn into a great game. I recommend this game for the story and to support the dev.\n\nNote to the dev: Keep working on this game to make it shine!","July 9, 2015","true","2.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

Its a great game that takes you back to memmory lane with the old school RPG's, great and to the point in battle and art yet having a fantastic story. This one may seem to take from the greats like the FF franchise but that is to be expected. The game is fun, enjoyable and rather interesting so a must have for games that love RPG's.

(not in the game) Barberic!!\nBehold our mighty hero, KEEEVIIIN!!\n\n\n-Combat System: Although not unique, its definitely cute and fancy, if not a bit laggy, at first i though it was my pc, but a week later i got a new one suited for games, but the results were the same, the screen freezes for 5 seconds when you attack a mob, but hey, Early Acess right?\n\n- Art Style: The art style is definitely something i can say unique, its the first indie game on Steam i've seen with such cute and fancy designs, the font is also very good.\n\nYou know what, i suck at reviews so just get the game, it will be totally worth it.\nI got it on a bundle and still haven't regret it, and now its on sale too as it seems, 15 cent its totally worth a buy.","September 25, 2015","true","3.2"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","6","10","0","0"

Yes i've only played a couple hours of this game but in those couple hours i have only noticed one fault.\nPros:\n- Music is great and uplifting.\n- Graphics are great for a pixelated rpg.\n- Mechanics are easy to use and work well\n- There is a fair amount of humor.\n- Nostalgia is to be had.\n- Overall fun game.\n- Easy to use Save system.\nCons:\n- If you get into a fight with one of the flying eyeball monsters, i've noticed that it after 1-2 attacks it will bring up an error and the game will crash and exit.\n\nOther than the error i havent seen any other problems with this game. Its a $0.99 game, on sale for 14 cents when i bought it. I honestly think it is worth more than even the original price. It is a great game if you like RPG's. Easy to pick up, and will keep you engaged. The save system is also pretty nice. I recomend this game. Would make a great gift or even a great game to add to your own collection.

SO why am I not recommending this game even though there's over 50 hours of gameplay and the story is decent, nothing too great mind you but it's still decent. The main reason I"m not recommending this game is the developer, I bought this game well over 6 months ago, and don't let my hours fool you I maybe only put in 2 hours on my account, the rest was a new game and wandering around trying to find more content. From what i understand this game has a HUGE map and many hours of gameplay, but he can't see to get some game breaking glitches out of the way that prevent you from getting past the first main area of the game. At first I didn't want to write this review because I felt for the guy, there's only one person who is developing this game and I like to support indie Devs, but this is just terrible. The Dev is fully aware of the glitches in the game and has had ample time to fix them. Assuming this game ever gets finished I will probably change my review since I see a lot of potential in this game, but for the time being I would not recommend this to anyone, even with it's low price tag of 1 USD.","March 16","false","3.9"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","8","14","0","0"

A sprinting feature has been added, and battles are much quicker-paced now (and the addition of a battle theme while a minor thing as I KNEW it was going to get added sooner or later, really does help).  I'll append any issues/concerns to this review as I continue to play the game, but seeing as the two major things that originally made me not recommend this game have been fixed I see no reason to currently keep my "not recommended" for this game.  Below is my original review and most of it can be disregarded at this point.\n::EDIT::\n\nI'm hoping the finished product of this game has more finese and polish but seeing as it's Early Access I have to let some things slide in its current state.  The concept is great, the art style is great, but the game still needs those "little things" to make it entertaining to play and get on par with most other 90's JRPG's.  I'll point out a few personal gripes which I hope are addressed in future releases.  Keep in mind these are only first impressions and I have yet to really get my hands deep into this game.\n\nThe walking feels sluggish.  The ability to sprint would be much welcomed, or at least quicker walking in general.  I am sure being able to walk quicker either by keypress or an item will be added or it's just something I have yet to find, etc. as it seems to be a common thing in most JRPG's.\n\nBattles are way too slow.  There is no energy in them at all but like most JRPG's of the 90's it's the one thing you absolutely dread in the game, to see that battle transition and have to endure yet another random battle.  Battle music is a must (though I'd be stupid to assume this isn't going to be added later on.  lol)  One thing I liked about Suikoden and Breath of Fire is the battles were quick-paced and they felt like you were in a high-energy fight and not watching some slow chess match unfold before your eyes.\n\nI have barely scratched the surface of this game and only just made it to the hut near the start of the game, but it's these two things that made me save and quit for now.  There is a lot of promise and hope for this game and if the developer delivers on all things they said this game will be then I'm really hyped for the finished product and I hope the current price changes accordingly to the finished product if it lives up to the hype.  But as it stands right now the price is on point for getting early adopters to get a taste of things to come.  As of writing this review it pains me to say I can't really recommend this game for anyone who wants to get right into some great RPG action as it's just not there yet.  However once this game nears completion I am sure I will change my recommendation with ease.  But for anyone who wants to experience this game as it gets completed and offer input as to what should be added, give bug reports, etc. then at this price I WILL definitely recommend this game to those people.","February 9, 2015","true","11.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","2"

Also, the volume of the music in some areas dont seem to be at the same setting; for example, the volume of music in the willow themed city (forgot the name) seem to be very low, so I turn up the volume of the game.

The game play is decent for it being so early. I have noticed some spelling errors, but that's to be expected, this is a game, with a lot of potential. And I seriously can't wait to see it evolve.\n\nMy favorite part of the game is when you try to go into the tunnel after leaving the first city, it tells you "This is Bug City" xD I like that the devs at least are "man" enough to address that the next area has issues, and doesn't want the bugs to ruin the gaming experience, so they block it off.\n\nThat's pretty damn awesome.\n\nSoundtrack: The music is okay, I'm not a fan of it personally. But it compliments the atmosphere of the game. I tried turning the music off, and... the game just didn't seem to right, nothing was wrong of course. But the soundtrack is definatly a huge part of this game.\n\nGameplay: I find the keyboard controls to be a little clustered together, and too far apart at the same time, making me wish I had three arms, but I believe there is a way to remap. I just plugged my controller in and went from there.\n\nCombat: As mentioned in the overview, it's a final fantasy style turn based combat system, that could do with some upgrading. I noticed the sounds to attack animations are a little off, but it just might be me on my ancient system. So I don't mind too terribly much.\n\n\nAll in all, will continue to play, love the game, the DEVS actually look like they're trying to make a good game, and not a cash grab so Kudo's to them for that.\n\nThis game is good enough to the point where I gifted it to everyone on my friendslist. (Granted it's pretty cheap atm) but I never gift games. Ever.","September 8, 2015","true","0.9"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","4","7","0","0"

These hiccups are super common an will happen several times per minute, absolutely destroying the flow of gameplay. Better not talk to any NPCs because giving them attention will freeze time itself.\n\n- weird, unpleasant graphical glitches in combat. the spell animations will almost always target the area where a character was previously standing or the area between the PC and monster parties. So for example you will cast a burn spell and a little fire will appear on the enemy and cause damage sometimes but many other times the fire animation will play over empty air somewhere else on the screen and damage numbers will flash above the enemy who is severa inches away. Or sometimes a healing aura will appear around your party members when you cast heal but, again, sometimes that healing aura animation will appear above empty air.\n\n- weird slow sludgey movement. on some screens you can run but on other screens your running button is disabled.","July 22, 2015","false","0.8"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

These hiccups are super common an will happen several times per minute, absolutely destroying the flow of gameplay. Better not talk to any NPCs because giving them attention will freeze time itself.\n\n- weird, unpleasant graphical glitches in combat. the spell animations will almost always target the area where a character was previously standing or the area between the PC and monster parties. So for example you will cast a burn spell and a little fire will appear on the enemy and cause damage sometimes but many other times the fire animation will play over empty air somewhere else on the screen and damage numbers will flash above the enemy who is severa inches away. Or sometimes a healing aura will appear around your party members when you cast heal but, again, sometimes that healing aura animation will appear above empty air.\n\n- weird slow sludgey movement. on some screens you can run but on other screens your running button is disabled.","July 22, 2015","false","0.8"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

The art overall, I like. There could definitely be improvements made particular for me so far in the backround of the worldview, and in the few spell effects I've seen so far.\n\nThe animations are obviously something that is still to-do. All the combat animations that I've seen so far are unfinished.\nAlso the battle cursor is a strange little purple crystal, which appears over enemy heads, but there's no cursor over your own heroes. This bothers me quite a bit, as I'd like to see a nice clear cursor. Also if you hold down the select button in combat, it should just automatically select and target your "Attack" on a frontline enemy, as it does in every jrpg I've played before.\n\nThe music so far in the game is good. Particularly the battle music is really nice.\n\nI don't like that the initial warrior guy you meet is named Alexis. It's a females name as far as I'm aware. Personal complaint I know, but it's pretty lame, imo.\n\nWhen you open a treasure chest, you get no description or name(s) of the item(s) you found.\n\nThe characters I've been introduced to so far have nice portraits, and the dialogue seems pretty good, and standard, if not a bit modern.\n\nDefinitely would want more options for things like control configuration, and resizing of the windowed mode.\n\nOverall, seems like it could be a fun old-school type RPG to get into.\n\nI'll recommend it, because based on the small time I spent with it, I have an overall good impression of the game.","March 31","true","1.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Any criticism or praise will hopefully help with further versions of this game.\n\nFirst off, I will go ahead and state that an hour into it... minus a few grammatical errors, the story seems promising.  It is enough to make me want to go further into the game and I have to give props to the developer on that.  I know that a lot of the RPG maker games have a reputation for being complete ♥♥♥♥ in that department.\n\nThe music selection isn't too bad, but I feel like some of the pieces initially are out of place a little.  For instance, when heading into the Wilderness outside Willow, it seems like the music there would be more appropriate for a world map kind of song.  I got the impression that the Wilderness is supposed to be a place that is mysterious and dangerous, they literally don't know what's going on.  The music just seems like it doesn't fit the tone.  Battle music is spot on though, even if the victory music is a little annoying.\n\nI am kind of curious to see how big some of these stat numbers get by the end of the game.  It seems like with a lot of these games, people figure than bigger is better and that isn't always the case.  Any time you start off at level 1 with almost 1000 hp, things seem a little inflated.  I know that some of that may be a little beyond the control of the developer as they were dealing with the parameters of RPG maker, but it makes me expect ridiculous high stat numbers by the end of the game.\n\nSpeaking of bigger not always being better, my biggest complaint is that it seems like there's just a lot of wasted space on the maps.  Everything is spread out and it almost feels like filler just going from one area to another to artificially create added length.  I do not believe that was the developer's intent, it just seems like things are waaaaay too big.  One of the things most 2D rpgs have done in the past was to adjust the scale of buildings from the outside, not the case here.  I hope that a run feature is added in eventually or becomes available later in the game.\n\nEither way, I say this is definitely worth the cost of purchase.  It seems like a decent little time sink and a very good value for what I paid for it.  I hope the developer stays active on updating this game and improving it down the road, because at this point I plan to play to completion","November 15, 2015","true","1.0"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Where do I begin with the flaws of this puppy though?\n\nControls: The controls are basic and easy to understand; can't go wrong with up down left right space enter etc, and remapping them is easy enough. Nothing negative to say here.\n\nGraphics: The art design looked pretty original when I booted this up; though the fullscreen didn't work very well as the black side-bars were flashing various colours, mostly white and it kinda gave me a headache. The intro screen for a new game is quite nicely drawn and I expected the quality of that to go deeper once you get into the meat of the game, but the opening sequence was pretty terrible. I should have guessed it from the text actually; you could tell the developer wasn't really experienced with grammar as a whole, but I digress. Moving on to the main points you could say that the graphics are kind of slugish and sloppy; most of the actions that the characters make is very stiff and jumpy, and the game glitches out a lot. This isn't a PC issue either as I've been able to play Far Cry 4 on the highest setting with no lag what so ever - it's a design and or coding issue. Overall I'd say this needs some serious polish.\n\nSound: Oh my god the first song in the game when you see the fisherman talking is absolutely over used and terrible. I expected this game to have some gimmicky music and some silly FL-Studios based songs, but to use free-ware music is just a big no no. When you listen to the crystal breaking it's the same little sound three times in a row as well and that is like listening to a Wilhelm scream if you know what I mean. Overall the sound is very poor and unoriginal, kind of almost lazy in how the developer threw it in there too as the trigger-cues are off a few seconds on occasion.\n\nGameplay: Not too hard at all, though health, magic and what not are kind of all over the place. What I mean by that is simple; you start off with a jumbled number of health, it doesn't even have any consistant upgrades to it - it's just all over the place. You never want to start a game doing hundreds of damage either and your characters basically rip through everything with ease, while taking hundreds of points of damage. It would have been easier and more satisfying for the gamer to have earned that kind of power rather than to just be gifted it. I felt like I started half way into an adventure pretty much, it wasn't fun. The walking animation is extremely choppy as well and that ties into game play; exploration is a chore because of this, you always feel like you're going through mud and watching your character lurch forward to take a step is just sad. Overall the gameplay is basic during combat situations, but horrible otherwise. Oh and menu navigation is slow / can't skip cutscenes or tutorials etc.\n\nIn the end I'm glad I bought this for $0.14, though I feel ripped off almost. This is the kind of stuff I would release as a "pre-alpha" on Byond.com using a more visual c++ style of coding. This is what I'd call brain-storming mode where considering a kick starter or an alpha release isn't even viable as a logical option.\n\nDon't buy this for over five cents, actually this feels more like a "demo" to the pre-pre-pre alpha, like a first time coders first time coding something for the first time, a rough draft almost - so just get this for free if you can.\n\n[Edit] Furthermore I would suggest contemplating not supporting a developer whose going to harass reviewers who nay-say his/her game, just an FYI.","July 17, 2015","false","0.1"," 5 of 19 people (26%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","26","5","19","0","6"

I bought it on sale but it's definitely worth the $0.99.\n\nThe beginning of the game was pretty dialogue heavy but it was fine. As the game progresses and your party grows the game becomes more enjoyable. I liked the music and I thought the art/animations were fine. The story so far seems okay, I want to see how it ends so that's good.\n\nThe achievements were pretty simple. You get most of them just playing the game and talking to NPCs. You can miss some of them but you can just make a new game to get them since the easiest to miss are pretty early in the game. The small tasks and side quests were fun.\n\nControls were fine. I thought they were a bit weird at first or whenever someone new joins the party since there seems to be a delay when that happens but it's not a big deal.\n\nI would've liked to see some wild encounters against 3 or even 4 monsters later on, especially while grinding out the Mr. Moneybags achievement. I also would've liked to see more variety in monsters but that only became a "problem" when I was getting the Mr. Moneybags achievement since I just farmed one area.\n\nI hope the game gets a bit more challenging as it grows. A few encounters were tougher than the rest but your party members are never really at risk of dying later on.\n\nI liked the abilities each character unlocked as they leveled although I have no idea what some of the buffs do, I imagine they increase stats but I really don't know. I found myself using the attacks way more often than the buffs since most fights wouldn't last very long, especially with 4 party members.\n\nSo far the game is enjoyable and pretty easy. I recommend playing it. Currently it shouldn't take more than 5 hours to finish even if you take your time to interact with everything and read all the dialogue.","November 30, 2015","true","4.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The developer is just making this game in his spare time, so don't expect a great epic rpg game, expect a game that you can get on sale for under 25 cents most of the time. There is a reason for that.\n\nNow, saying that, and that the game is maybe updated every 6-12 months, you won't get much for your money but what you do get is well worth the hours of playing for a quarter. The gameplay is basic, there really isn't any inventory system, or stat building, or much "rpg" element to varying your character. You can't even change their names, but this game is more story/dialogue driven than rpg, its battle system is basic but you get into the characters a bit more. It does have some spelling errors but again its being done by 1 person on their own time, so just note the errors and send  them to him to fix, he is on the forums all the time.\n\nThe 1st chapter is done and hopefully eventually he will add more to the game, which he has hinted at. Again, don't expect many updates or fast, they occur every 6-12 months so you won't get a "finished" game for quite a while. Abilities are handled by equiping "scrolls" which give you some basic powers based on the scroll type. Equip the fire scroll so your character has fire abilities, find a demon scroll in the game to get demon powers, etc. This might become fun once more of the game is finished and you can put different powers on different characters how you like.\n\nSo i've played many games for under 25 cents that were junk, at least this one kept me busy for some hours and wasn't bad. Hopefully it will become "good" sometime soon.","November 30, 2015","true","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's his pet project and hes taking his time to do it right, and he really is (except for, perhaps, in my opinion, a dry beginning).\n\nSo consider this rough draft of a game a nice opportunity to look over the shoulder of a friendly developer. It's interesting to watch someone craft an RPGmaker game bit by bit, as opposed to the man-behind-the-curtain relationship most steam gamers have with the devs.\n\nFinally, first 15-20 minutes in, game's a little sluggish and dull, but once I hit the first town, I had a lot of fun playing it!","December 29, 2015","true","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Maybe. The game is pretty short and combat isn't really balanced. One thing that's prevalent is a crash that occurs randomly. Since there's only certain places to save, you can lose a lot of time from these crashes. Personally, there's better old school rpgs out there that have more depth than this one.","December 19, 2015","false","9.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I bought it on sale but it's definitely worth the $0.99.\n\nThe beginning of the game was pretty dialogue heavy but it was fine. As the game progresses and your party grows the game becomes more enjoyable. I liked the music and I thought the art/animations were fine. The story so far seems okay, I want to see how it ends so that's good.\n\nThe achievements were pretty simple. You get most of them just playing the game and talking to NPCs. You can miss some of them but you can just make a new game to get them since the easiest to miss are pretty early in the game. The small tasks and side quests were fun.\n\nControls were fine. I thought they were a bit weird at first or whenever someone new joins the party since there seems to be a delay when that happens but it's not a big deal.\n\nI would've liked to see some wild encounters against 3 or even 4 monsters later on, especially while grinding out the Mr. Moneybags achievement. I also would've liked to see more variety in monsters but that only became a "problem" when I was getting the Mr. Moneybags achievement since I just farmed one area.\n\nI hope the game gets a bit more challenging as it grows. A few encounters were tougher than the rest but your party members are never really at risk of dying later on.\n\nI liked the abilities each character unlocked as they leveled although I have no idea what some of the buffs do, I imagine they increase stats but I really don't know. I found myself using the attacks way more often than the buffs since most fights wouldn't last very long, especially with 4 party members.\n\nSo far the game is enjoyable and pretty easy. I recommend playing it. Currently it shouldn't take more than 5 hours to finish even if you take your time to interact with everything and read all the dialogue.","November 30, 2015","true","4.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The developer is just making this game in his spare time, so don't expect a great epic rpg game, expect a game that you can get on sale for under 25 cents most of the time. There is a reason for that.\n\nNow, saying that, and that the game is maybe updated every 6-12 months, you won't get much for your money but what you do get is well worth the hours of playing for a quarter. The gameplay is basic, there really isn't any inventory system, or stat building, or much "rpg" element to varying your character. You can't even change their names, but this game is more story/dialogue driven than rpg, its battle system is basic but you get into the characters a bit more. It does have some spelling errors but again its being done by 1 person on their own time, so just note the errors and send  them to him to fix, he is on the forums all the time.\n\nThe 1st chapter is done and hopefully eventually he will add more to the game, which he has hinted at. Again, don't expect many updates or fast, they occur every 6-12 months so you won't get a "finished" game for quite a while. Abilities are handled by equiping "scrolls" which give you some basic powers based on the scroll type. Equip the fire scroll so your character has fire abilities, find a demon scroll in the game to get demon powers, etc. This might become fun once more of the game is finished and you can put different powers on different characters how you like.\n\nSo i've played many games for under 25 cents that were junk, at least this one kept me busy for some hours and wasn't bad. Hopefully it will become "good" sometime soon.","November 30, 2015","true","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I've only played 17 minnutes but I can already tell I won't like it, luckily it was gifted to me when it was 17 cents so I doubt the person who gifted it to me will lose much sleep over me saying that I truly dislike this game, very much.\n\nLet's start out with the pros.\n- Looks decent for what I assume to be an indie game.\n- The music is... okay.\n- The battle system is easy to grasp, as it's very similar to Final Fantasy.\n\nAnd here's some cons:\n- The battle system is TOO easy to grasp, as it's exactly the same as Final Fantasy's but less functional and slower.\n- Movement is slow.\n- The forest area isn't terribly exciting.\n- The monsters aren't unique in any way.\n\nI'd recommend this game to someone if they'd never played another game in this genre bfore, or never even heard of Final Fantasy, because I'm sure without those experiences, I'd enjoy this game.

This is exactly what I've been looking for, I cannot wait for more of the story to unfold and to be able to finish Terra! This brings back my love for adventure games and has a special "old skool" feel that has really drawn me in. (If the developers can read this) FYI, I think there is a typo when Tybalt joins the "Paty"-> "party"*. Good luck with the rest of the game!

I'll just be straight up.\n\nPros:\n- The buildings and environment look amazing. It'll take you back to the old feeling you once had!\n\nCons:\nEarly Access - (I hope these get fixed!)\n- No auto-run. You need to hold SHIFT if you want to run. Please, make it so once you click SHIFT once you will auto-run until you hit SHIFT again.\n- Not able to run indoors. Frustrating to enter a building and you can't run. Speaking of the whole auto-run (or lack thereof), I don't know why anybody would choose to walk. I think having a default run character would be great. No need to have walk as an option.\n- The animations during combat don't sync up that well. If an enemy attacks me and I use a spell right after, the spell will hit in the location they were at to attack me instead of where they currently are at.\n- Grammatical errors. Lots of them! While I'm not trying to be anal about it, I don't see how not capitalizing a character's name would get by. The smaller ones such as a misuse or non-existent comma are understandable.\n\nFunny Stuff!:\nNot to be taken seriously\n- Title screen music reminds me of 'Band of Horses' - 'The Funeral'\n- Get yelled at for trying to enter a house uninvited! Come on now, in an RPG you can't enter somebody's house, loot it and leave without repercussions!?\n- 2 hours long. A 2 hour long (early access) RPG? Where are the 10+ hour RPGs I grew up with?\n\nOverall I like this game and I hope the developer(s) fix the bugs/glitches/errors and ultimately create a successful game (series). Be seeing you in the future for the next patch and/or offical release!","January 15","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/triumofficial/recommended/347560/","triumofficial","Trium","http://steamcommunity.com/id/triumofficial/","37 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nTerra Incognita overall is a very nostalgic game and reminds me of The older Legend of Zelda and Final Fantasy franchise games. Because this game is still in beta, there are obviously still aspects of the game that can be improved upon.\nSuch as:-\n- The game's controls, the remap menu is very confusing and I could not undertstand which control was what. I tried playing with a gamepad and the controls there were also very confusing to use. This may be because I was using a Dualshock 4 controller through DS4 Windows therefore converting it to a 360 gamepad, but I highly doubt it as I have had no trouble before.\n\n- A run option should be added to the battle menu. It gets quite annoying when you are trying to progress through the game and you get random battles popping up all the time.\n\n- The Steam Overlay is also not availabe in-game. This might be just my computer I play in fullscreen mode. If anyone else if having trouble with this then I suggest reporting it.\n\n- When you try and 'Tab out' of the game in fullscreen mode, the image of the game is still visible on screen and prevents me from seeing anything behind the image. Only closing the game seems to fix this. This is very annoying as if I need to do something when Im in the middle of playing I have to close the game and then re-open and continue from when I last saved.\n\nHowever despite this game's flaws I feel that if the developer puts in some extra time and effort into fully finishing the game and possibly expanding the plot then this could become a very popular franchise. The feeling of nostalgia when playing this game brings back great memories from some of the original RPG Adventure games like Zelda and if this game is completed, it could one day give Zelda a run for its money!","May 22","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
