"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ryandesigns/recommended/319430/","ryandesigns","Vindictiiv","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ryandesigns/","120 products in account","This is the worst full release game I think I've ever played.\n\nLets start with why. The game doesn't even run unless you drop your Java version back to 7. Then you have to hunt down a mysterious executable and then run that before you can even launch the game in Steam. So basically - it doesn't run. If you do happen to do this (which I did) you can get it to work - kinda.\n\nCharacter creation is really more like character class selection. With 5 very basic types, Guardian, Warrior, Priest, Mage and Rogue types. No customization whatsoever.\n\nYou start in a "lobby" of sorts? Its a very minimal castle type structure and the game tells you to go talk to some knight guy. This is probably where you'll start to regret your purchase. The keys are not by default bound to traditional WASD for movement - fine so I go to change them- and figure out that you cant change them in the UI at all. You have to enter commands in the chat window to rebind each key. UGH really? Fine, did that.\n\nNow you talk to the knight guy and he tells you to go to the hall of prayers or some crap but doesnt tell you where it is or really even what to do once youre there. So you'll guess which portal it is after some trial and error then enter.\n\nIts gets worse  - I couldnt figure out WTF was going on in this game whatsoever  - even after you get the controls bound, they are still stiff and unresponsive. Then you might also realize whats equipped on your character doesnt even show up on your avatar. My sword and Axe must be magic, invisible weapons yay!\n\nI just cant go on about how bad this game is...especially if they think this is the full release. I've seen games in far better states in Alpha. Just avoid the headache.\n\nPros -\nCreative Concept?\nMade the devs some money?\nWasted 20 mins of solid bordom and replace it with sheer frustration.\nWill make you more wary of buying random crap on Steam.\n\nCons -\nDoesn't work well at all.\nBad Graphics.\nTerrible Controls.\nNot fun.\n\n\n","October 7, 2015","false","0.5"," 96 of 114 people (84%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","84","96","114","13","1"

The problem is it's not Early Access, and it's incredibly unpolished.  The idea has potential, unfortunately this feels like a project that ended in the early stages, and trying to grab some money on the way out.\n\nIf you take this idea, MMO style, polish the fighting, add in grouping mechinism through steam, it could be really fun.  As it stands it feels like the bare minimum was put in to get something out the door.\n\nThe fighting, it's like a very early attempt at cloning your MMO style fighting, but with absolutely no polish, and the AI you can kite back until they run in place and seem to get stuck.\n\nThe only thing I learned from this game, is I wish someone would come out with a game that would emulate the raids/dungeons of WoW, balance it so you can solo, or do like flex mode in WoW where you can add in randoms.  You can even make the trinity required, for groups...would def throw money at a game and dlc for more dungeons and raids.","December 15, 2015","false","0.4"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

So far I must admit I like the game. The reports of JAVA issues such as requiring an older, outdated version of Java are no longer the case. The game is fun and kind of reminds me of some earlier MMOs like Everquest, or Everquest II perhaps, but this game is a lot of fun. I like the simplicity in design. You are in a small keep, there are shops to buy/sell equipment, a black market, and multiple dungeon types. There are NPCs who can offer quests, and one that can teleport you to the entrance of a dungeon that you have access to. Your hero goes up levels anhd then also gains levels in Skills which grant the hero skill points to improve the known skills the hero has.\n\nI haven't experieinced any crashes or other potential problems. I've played for a few hours here and there since yesterday and never have I experieinced any issues.\n\nWhile the game is a lot of fun, it does have some areas that I woiuldn't say are bad, but simply could be implemented better to make the game easier to setup, configure and run. For example....\n\n1. In order to play, even single player locally, you must first launch the server executable that comes with the game. Then you can load the game and select "JOIN" to connect to your local server.\n\nIt would be nice if in the main menu there was the option of "HOST" to go along with "JOIN" server. This would/could negate the need of launching that external server exe file first, then the actual game file.\n\n2. You have to edit (with a text editor) a config file in the game installation folder if you wish to modify the key binding. that or do it via chat commands such as /kbind W Forward, or something like that. Too much of a pain in the ♥♥♥♥ to do in game, so I just went in and edited all the keys directly in the .cfg file.\n\n3. Would have loved to have some sort of comparison feature when looking at an item in your inventory and deciding on whether to equip it after removing the currently equipped item. Items have various stats and abilities and looking back and forth to see what abilities goe up, which go down is a pain personally. I'd have liked to see something like you hover the cursor over the item in your inventory and then it shows you a popup window with the currently equipped item and any stats that will be less marked in red, any stats improving in green. It sort of does this currently, but that requires you to equip an item then study the dozens of stat types listed on your hero sheet, then swap back to the originally equipped item to view the changes in statistics of the hero. Would be much easier to just highlight an item in your inventory and instally get a popup showing the benefits or improvements, and any negatives or penalties to the hero's stats without having to equip the item first.\n\nWell, thats all for now. as I mentioned I really like this game and will continue to play. I got a friend to pick it up too so we will try some multiplayer mayhem soon!","December 21, 2015","true","8.5"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","78","14","18","2","1"

There is an old post stating you can get it running if you run old versions of Java which arent easy to find. For me i could not get this game running even after trying just about every version of Java JRE there was (version 7 +8). It even tells you which Java software to run then redirects you to a newer version which doesn't work.\n\nBottom line, Its broke and they arent around to fix it.","April 19","false","0.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/trasho/recommended/319430/","trasho","Trasho","http://steamcommunity.com/id/trasho/","109 products in account","This game launched with alot of problems and still has things that have to be worked out before you really get going. Like changing your buttons to WASD because the defualt movement controls are insaine which isn't all that easy. You have to alter the hotkeys file yourself which can be found in the games folder.(in the steam folder)\n\nAfter I got this game up and running I've really been having a great time with it. Not only are the monsters fairly hard to deal with until you've gotten familiar with them but random monsters spawn in every so often just to through off your rhythm and force you to deal with the unexpected. The gaphics feel low fi and there are some bugs but all in all I'd much rather be playing this than all that free to play mmo nonsenese going on out there right now.\n\nI have one chr level 4 and another at 10, I am excited to level up more. I really enjoy only having about 6 different skills(per character) that have points added to them as you level.  Its simple yet forces you to develop tactical initiations with enemies.\n\nThe view can be zoomed into first person and pulled out to thrird person(which I LOVE).\n\nMy favorite game series is Diablo, I love 1,2, and even 3.  When I am playing D3 i often think, If I only had a couple more skills and the gear was more thought out so you dont have to have billions of dps to get anywhere.  While this game is far different from diablo it fills in the gaps I was desiring in a game perfectly.\n\nThe game currently plays off private servers you host for yourself but Im hoping the dev launches some public servers so we can all have a blast together(chr info is saved on your end so everything goes with you from server to server). They are working on being able to join other peoples servers right now. Its a super small dev team but so far they have impressed me immesly.  It's nice when things work perfectly but I am also a tinkerer so any problems launching the game initially is all superficial to me. The gameplay is awesome.","October 9, 2015","true","23.5"," 14 of 28 people (50%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","50","14","28","4","0"

The controls can be changed in game and once I switched to WASD movement, it was very smooth. If you are smart and pay attention to detail, I think the game won't be as confusing as it will be to mindless players. Things are easy to figure out and attributes for example have tooltips that tell you exactly what they do.\n\nThe game itself has 3 game modes which I only played one so far, adventure mode. It is essentially a dungeon crawler with quests. Lots of random loot with varying rarities just like Path of Exile except there is durability which never gets repaired. You will always want to find items. The game felt rewarding with the item drops, a better weapon really felt like it killed stuff faster.\n\nThe multiplayer requires IP addresses, in other words, it takes effort. If you don't have the patience or the friends then consider this a single player game (Which has been fun for me so far).\n\nEDIT: Just played Defense of the Fort! Its awesome! You have to fight off waves of monsters and you hire mercenaries to help you out! You can upgrade them as well and you control them as you would a pet bar in any other MMO. I think its awesome!\n\n\nPros:\n-Creative Concepts\n-Lots of loot if you like treasure hunting\n-Runs smooth/optimized\n-Combat has a familiar flavor if you ever played an MMO. Tab targetting, hotkey based skills plus an autoattack.\n\nCons:\n-Bugs (Which will be patched)\n-Having to run server.exe even if you are playing solo is silly.\n-Multiplayer needs to be intergrated into the game. Steam is the perfect platform for that.\n-PvP game mode seems to be a multiplayer thing. Again, they need to intergrate multiplayer in the game.\n-Alt tabbing while fullscreen causes the game to be permanently minimized.\n\n\nOverall, I have two ratings to give this game.\n\nRating #1:  8.5/10    Based on future potential if they keep patching the game and integrate multiplayer.\n\nRating #2: 7/10     Based on what we get right now assuming there won't be much changed or added.\n\nI personally don't regret the purchase and I'm gonna keep playing it, trying out all the classes. My only disappointment is the IP based multiplayer in the year 2015.","October 7, 2015","true","5.9"," 18 of 42 people (43%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","43","18","42","4","4"
