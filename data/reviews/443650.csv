I would have loved to see more of the world\n- Pathfinding isn`t always optimal (especially if you walk "behind" other characters you may walk into them occasionally)\n- Note for the developers: Do a hint or questlog in your next game so you have an overview as a user what to do next.\n\nI made a walkthrough for the game if you get stuck, so check it out:\nhttps://youtu.be/T1z9vihfDZc","April 27","true","5.9"," 22 of 26 people (85%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","85","22","26","3","0"

It doesn't have illogical puzzles, or a vast number of items that you don't know how to combine, it's streamlined (in a good way). As long as you pay attention to the surroundings, and the dialogue, then most solutions will come to you quickly.\n\nThe voice acting is really good, the music will get you singing for sure, and the characters are cute, and comical but also make sense, in a weird way. There are also lots of pop culture references that will make you smile throughout.\n\nThe graphical style works great I think, and it allows for some really detailed characters, and vibrant surrounding, all without needing a lot of resources.\n\nWailing Heights has greatly polished elements (graphics, music, dialogue, characters) and you can see that a lot of heart and soul went into making it.\n\nQuick note, I played (and finished the game twice) with the keyboard/mouse but there's also controller support.\n\nIf you want to see more of Wailing Heights, and hear about how it was made check out the developer interview/live stream here\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPyny1d-gc8","April 27","true","18.6"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","11","13","2","0"

Like a B horror flick this game is full of bugs, missing odd pieces of voiced dialogue, limited voice actors and subpar recording, goofy glitchy visuals, and some corny music.\n\nBut for all that the games just bursting with heart. All the problems above almost add to the ambiance and sense of the game. The characters and world is bursting with color, amazing detailed enviroments, and while some of the music is silly and repetitive, the main hits in the game are really catchy. The game also features beautiful comic styled cutscenes that all really fit the vibe of the city.\n\nSome of the puzzle aspects are somewhat vague, and if you miss something small you may be stuck for a little while, but overall the game does a good job of guiding you between objectives. The possesion mechanic is great albiet a little confusing at times when trying to solve puzzles that require specific characters.\n\nSo while this game is definitely unpolished and rough, it manages to do well with what it has, and over all a very enjoyable experience.  One has to wonder if the developers had the means to really polish this game what it may have been, and if maybe it's almost better this way...\n\n","May 5","true","6.1"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

I really loved the humour, music and visual style.

As of right now, it's much too buggy. I've been sent outside of the map several times, and some times, it can ruin any progression you've made thus far. I'll have to check back in later to see if these glitches have been patched.\n\nEdit: Turns out whatever was wrong with my game, had to do with my FPS. Even though I had a problem, I don't want it to turn anybody off from this game. If you're half interested, just buy it. It's a super fun and entertaining, and the developers seem super cool and on top of things!","April 29","true","1.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/beccam/recommended/443650/","beccam","beccam1951","http://steamcommunity.com/id/beccam/","2 products in account","Wailing Heights is an unsual and attractive looking game with very original content. There were some good music references and fun with the names of characters. I liked the overall look of the game, and the concept was interesting. Where I felt the gameplay was let down a little was the repetativeness of certain elements.\n\nThere appeared to be two Acts to the game and I liked the idea of splitting these, as Act 2 felt like a new part to the game. But I felt there should have been a final Act 3, maybe with a little more to do with finding 'the body.' Which seemed to become a little redundant towards the end of the game.\n\nThe music was very original, and fair play to the writers and voice actors used. But the same music playing over and over did get quite tedious after a while. Especially when I found myself waking up in the morning and the 'Betty the Banshee' one line on repeat in my head. I maybe should have looked to see whether there was an option to turn off the music within the game. Also I found the length in which it took to switch characters during the game started to annoy me a little. Especially when you had to listen to the whole of the song each time. Lola's loves and hates are now etched into my brain.\n\nUnfortunately this wasn't a game I really loved. It had its moments and some fun elements, but I found the gameplay repatative, especially towards the end and the final part of it quite a let down. I would still recommend this for the price and it's original content. Just I honestly have to say for me I would have liked a little more variety and some more streamlined elements.","May 21","true","5.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
