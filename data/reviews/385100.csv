Fired it up just to check it out, thought i would do other stuff. Three and a half hours later I write this. Even if I didn't play it ever again, it would be far more worth while than the $12 or so for the average two to three hour yawn fest movie. Much more entertainment dollar value to be found here for sure.\nIt's pixely space shooty physics fun.\nYou should buy this.","November 2, 2015","true","17.4"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","78","14","18","2","0"

This game should be worth way more, too; it's got polished, well-constructed gameplay, and hours of fun to be had.  Far more, anyway, than some more expensive games (*cough The Order 1886 cough*).

This is one of the rare indie gems I always look for when browsing Steam.\nThere isn't a plot, there are barely any instructions, this game is mainly about exploration, combination, and having fun. You can always fing something new and unexpected, a new type of asteroid that causes gravity fluctuation when you shoot it, or some kind of a bio-minefield that seems to be harvested by lasers. You can equip modifiers to your weapons that you can even combine (freezing, splitting, critting bullets anyone?).\nIf you like these kind of true sandbox games, and like to explore, for 3 dollars I can only recommend it.","November 7, 2015","true","2.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/recommended/385100/","Steamified","Warwick J.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/","3916 products in account","Space – The Return of the Pixxelfrazzer is a return to old school style space exploration action games. The developer, Sørb, is a one man show and it truly shows throughout the creation of the game. I do not mean that as a negative either. It’s a simple fact. Every game design choice all of the way through to the creation of game’s engine is decided, designed and developed by Sørb. A very admirable effort is made to create a solid game and it achieves that status, solid.\n\nIt’s space exploration at it’s near pinnacle. You start the game not knowing what to do but you have a basic quest outline – attack X many space ships. You kill them. Then you’re given another quest and then another. All of the while you’re starting to realize just how gigantic space is. Space is never quite what you would imagine it to be and that is a good thing. Objects can transform, including quest objects, into all sorts of different things. It’s arguably as close as you’ll get to feeling like Han Solo in the Empires Strikes Back flying the Millennium Falcon when he tries to evade an asteroid field in order to find a safe place only to fly into the mouth of an Exogorth without knowing it. Space has so many different quirks such as this it’s hard not to appreciate the amount of effort put into its design.\n\nThe variety of weapons, quests, planets, etc. are incredible creating a game world where there is seemingly always something to see and to enjoy. The sound and graphics are old school and therefore may not appeal to players demanding the latest and greatest but for someone who can appreciate the fact that sometimes less is more it is easy to look past and perhaps even appreciate more. Other than that there really isn’t much to knock about the game and that’s being fair. It’s not the greatest game of all time but there’s more than enough content here to spend a few hours with an enjoyable title.\n\nSadly with just 17 Steam reviews and an estimated 394 – 1858 total owners (according to SteamSpy), Space – The Return of the Pixxelfrazzer has been a criminally overlooked title that is yearning to be played.\n\nFor similar reviews and our popular daily giveaways please visit http://www.steamified.com/","January 28","true","3.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"
