"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Stefneh/recommended/113200/","Stefneh","Stefneh","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Stefneh/","777 products in account","After playing Super meat boy, I started looking out for new games by the same developer. Edmund Mcmillen’s wonderfully strange imagination is an interesting thing to explore through his games, that’s for sure.\n\nThis game was not a disappointment. At first, I had no idea what to expect, the trailer was very strange but a tad intriguing. When I came across it there was next to no information about the game and the mechanics of it on the store page and back then there was no costumer reviews to go off of. Admittedly I never actually brought it to give it a go off of the information I was given, I ended up with it from a bundle and it’s the only reason I really played it. Although I wish I had taken the leap to try it because it is well worth it.\n\nBinding of Isaac is a randomly generated dungeon crawler, one I have heard to be described as “Zelda-like” (I would have no idea about that, never played a Zelda game) you’re a young boy running from his demented mother. Who has been blinded by her hard-core Christianity and believes that the voice of god has spoken to her and told her to murder her son to prove her loyalty. So a very interesting concept, indeed.\n\nA short cut scene plays on start-up, which expands on what I just described, you find yourself wandering through randomly generated dungeon floors, fighting monsters, picking up loot and items as you go along that changes how you fight, gives you different abilities and drastically changes Isaac’s image. At the end of each floor, you fight a boss, and move on down to the next floor. It being harder than before, with a bigger space to explore and more enemies to defeat.\n\nThere’s a large range of items to collect that when found for the first time is added to the “things I found” section in the main menu, so a lovely bit of collecting there to entice those OCD minded like myself, There’s new characters to unlock which vary in stats, challenges to complete and even some DLC that can extend your gameplay.\n\nYou are given one life and one life only. You can find hearts to heal, but once you are dead, that’s it, you start all over again. So throughout the whole game and especially when nearing the end, it starts to put a little pressure on and gets that heart rate going. I’m not one to be good under pressure so it gets me every time. I FINALLY managed to complete the game a few times over, again, admittedly, only after I gained some “top tips” from my way-to-good-at-games brother. There have been people that have completed the game 10 times over and still not gotten bored. I think that the randomly generated dungeon element to it keeps its replay ability intact. If it were to replay the same levels over and over when you died, the game would be a lot different and no doubt a lot less popular.\n\nI have heard from friends that it is quite hard to complete without “doing your research” on the wiki or seeking tips from those nerdy minded like my brother who managed to figure all of it out themselves. I on the other hand find that kind of thing enjoyable, because it beats you every time and you work and research and try to understand the game more to finally get to that ending. I can quite honestly say that the first time I reached the end, my heart has never beaten that loud or that fast in a long time. And that sense of accomplishment you get from finishing a game, is a on a much higher scale when you work to complete this one.\n\nThe music is great, it fits the setting perfectly and is great to listen to. Rarely have I actually wanted to download a game’s soundtrack, I can give most soundtracks a thumbs up but not often do I actually want to listen to game music outside of gaming.\nThe art, as per usual in Edmunds games, is amazing. And I hear they are also looking to remake the game to have a more “retro” look, with possible multiplayer features. Which should be very interesting. For those interested you can look up “Binding of Isaac: Rebirth”.\n\nAll in all, it is a great indie game, which is both fun and challenging. Definitely worth trying, I am not usually the dungeon crawler type, but this game is a lot of fun. The only fault that I had with this game, which has bothered me quite a few times now, is that I have lost my save for no reason. The game is listed as having ‘Steam Cloud’ features, but it definitely doesn't work. I haven't uninstalled the game, I haven't touched it. But recently I hopped on and seen all the progress that I had made was gone. And for a game that has no real save points or ongoing plot to keep up with, your stats, unlocked characters and collection of things you have found is pretty much all you have. I was pretty upset to see it had vanished and it’s something I felt I needed to warn people about.\n\n\nTL;DR : Awesome music, fun and engaging game with a slightly 'twisted' side to it. It's a challenge to reach the end and you can definitely end up putting a lot of hours into this. Addictive and awesome all around.","March 19, 2014","true","130.2"," 345 of 363 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","345","363","0","15"

Due to all the secrets, items, enemies and most importantly the difficulty it has a ton of replay value.\n\nWhen I say difficult I really do mean it but the more you play the more you learn how to overcome many of the challenges that the game has to offer.\n\nAnother reason I enjoyed it was the randomly generated levels, this also comes with random enemies, items and secrets, so no two runs end up being the same.\n\nThe game also borrows a lot from Zelda, so if you are a fan of the level design and many of the mechanics of the early Zelda dungeons and items you will probably be a fan of this.\n\n\nOther than the solid game play it is aesthetically pleasing because of Edmund McMillen's really fun and quirky art style.\n\nI really recommend you pick up this title and the expansion pack as soon as possible.","December 29, 2013","true","683.7"," 232 of 248 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","232","248","0","7"

This is by far the best indie games of 2011 I have played. Old school NES Fans, you will not be disappointed. This game has a somewhat resemblance to The Legend of Zelda's dungeons. Even newer gamers will appreciate this addicting, simple yet complex Rogue-Shooter. Coming from the makers of Super Meat Boy, this is a sad comedic gore fest full of surprises. Note that You will die a lot at first but as you keep playing, there are a lot of things to unlock and discover. This game's price value is also a must get for your steam game collection. At 4,99€ you can't go wrong no matter what. Dungeons filled with disgusting and gory, yet funny and sad enemies, will leave you wanting more and more. I found myself a lot of times putting other games aside to go play this game. I will end this review short and simple.\n\nA little game with some really good working dark humor.

The gameplay is top down shooter brilliance. While there will be times that the game will pull a ♥♥♥♥ move on you, (it can be quite luck based at times) you won't be blaming your death on a bug of any description. Unless you're a sore loser, but that's your fault, not the game's.\n\nWhile the atmosphere may gross some very few sensitive souls amongst you, it has a reason for being that way and just enhances the (probably short) experiences throughout the game. If you've played Super Meat Boy, you'll feel right at home though, Edmund McMillen's the mastermind behind these two greats, and if you like his work, I also strongly recommend picking up the Basement Collection. Yes, I just recommended a game in another game's recommendation. (Recommendception!)\n\nThe real reason why I love this game so damn much though, is its stellar replay value. Every single time you start a new game, (and you'll probably start many) everything will be randomized. Enemies, boss fights, of which many are very challenging, items and powerups (good luck getting them all eventually) and rooms (some there to just screw you up with a deadly enemy mix, others with some goodies in) are all always different. Even if you beat the game fully once, there will be more things to do every single time.\n\nBe warned though, that the DLC raises difficulty quite a bit. If you feel like you need to be eased into the game first slowly, you should play the vanilla first, and then activate the DLC. Besides that, the DLC adds tons of content and new fights and is most definitely recommended.\n\nIt has amazing gameplay that keeps you coming back after getting roflstomped, great replay value, and a dirt cheap price. This game is a must in my opinion.","June 27, 2013","true","20.9"," 104 of 121 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","104","121","0","2"

I think it was around my 500 hour mark when Rebirth was released and I was hyped like everyone else but my interest for Rebirth died down really fast and I continued playing Classic Isaac (for a more detailed review on why I prefer Classic Isaac over Rebirth, feel free to check my Review for Rebirth.)\n\nHowever, I absolutely love this game. I would even go so far and say that it's the absolute best game I have ever played and I started playing games when I had a SNES, so calling a game that was made in flash my favorite game of all time is a huge accomplishment.\n\nThe skill cap in this game is something that is insanely good, games where you can feel that you get progressively better are very rare to come across, but the more you play it, the more you learn what which items do how you can get the most out of every single floor and of course dodging, the more you play it, the better you get at it.\n\nThe cool thing is, that even after 700 hours you might not find any more secrets or anything like that, but the game never feels repetitive, since every run has a different layout of floors, the items you find are different, the bosses you find are different and the drops you find, as well.\n\nAlso what this game has over Rebirth, in my opinion, is the limited amount of Items.\nSure, there are people who say that at some point u just get specific items and just restart a run to the point where you get an item that is useful, so you limit yourself to a certain amount of items. But that's all up to oneself. You can either restart all time until you get your desired item, but you can also start off with a really bad item and get god-tier items along the way. The way how you play a run with a bad item and how you eventually make it work is all up to your skill at the long run.\nWhat I was trying to say is, there are less items in Classic Isaac than in Rebirth, so ultimately you have more control and it is more likely that you get an item that you actually like. As I said, some might see that as a negative, since you limit yourself to certain items, but if I play 20+ runs and only get 1 run where I get 1 item that I like, that's no fun to me.\n\nAll in all The Binding of Isaac is my favorite game of all time, I would even say the benchmark for all Rogue-like games.\n\n(Eternal Edition) As far as the eternal edition go (which is an update for Isaac that was released a couple of days ago) I totally enjoy this update. It adds a Hard Mode to the gae, so for people who have played this game for 700+ hours and don't wanna switch over to Rebirth, this is a great addition, because the name "Hard Mode" is exactly what it says.\n\nThere are "eternal forms" of regular mobs and bosses who are way tougher to beat. They have more hit points and different attacks. Another thing that they fixed, which they also added for the regular version, is the time you freeze whenever you pick up an item, trinket, pill, tarot- or playing card. The frame in which you freeze and can't move has been reduced which makes it easier for you to dodge enemies.\nOnce the bugs have been ironed out (there is currently a bug where you can't get out of a room when you fight the eternal form of "Loki" this update will be even more awesome than it already is.\n\nAs I said, if you love Rogue-likes, chances are that you already have this game, but if not, you should definitely give this game a try.\n\nI already have 700+ hours in this game and I plan to invest more hours in the future. This game never gets old.","May 4, 2015","true","779.5"," 76 of 81 people (94%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","94","76","81","4","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GilderoyDarling/recommended/113200/","GilderoyDarling","Dr. Gilderoy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GilderoyDarling/","69 products in account",""Yay cancer!" - just Binding of Isaac quotes\n\nThe Binding of Isaac is a Flash-based roguelike dungeon crawler reminiscent of early Legend of Zelda games developed by Edmund McMillen and Florian Himsl. Inspired heavily from the Biblical story, the game follows Isaac (and a variety of unlockable characters) escaping from his Christian fundamentalist Mother, to whom a voice of God commands to sacrifice Isaac.\n\n* Gameplay\n\nAfter escaping from his Mother’s wrath, Isaac finds himself in a basement filled with monsters. Each floor contains a set amount of rooms culminating with a boss fight that must be cleared in order to advance to the next floor. Along the way Isaac can collect pennies (nickels and dimes as variants) to spend in a Shop or an Arcade, bombs to blow up obstacles or enemies and keys to unlock chests and Treasure rooms. The items found in Treasure rooms, after completing a boss fight and other ways are the core to improving Isaac’s tears (bullets) and fighting abilities. For example, an item can make tears homing, poisonous, increase damage and so on. My favourite is the Ipecac item, which makes your tears explosive and always poisonous. If requirements are fulfilled, Isaac can after a boss fight trade his heart containers to the Devil in exchange for powerful items, or alternatively, avoid taking deals with the Devil to acquire a chance for an Offering from an Angel (Wrath of the Lamb DLC required) which can be useful as well.  The game at first seems very difficult, but as it is completed more and more times, new items, characters, alternate bosses and floors can be unlocked, ensuring there will always be a reason to explore. The game also features many references to McMillen’s other games, such as Super Meat Boy and Time ♥♥♥♥, as well as popular games such as Super Mario, Legend of Zelda and others.\n\n* Expansions and the community\n\nWhile the base game is fairly extensive, I heavily recommend obtaining Wrath of the Lamb DLC, which adds 98 new items, a new character, new floors and many other content that improve the experience. Owning said DLC is a prerequisite for the Eternal Update, a free addon developed by Florian Himsl that adds Hard mode, which offers a brutal experience for those feeling the base game was too easy. The Binding of Isaac is very popular and well known, as a result from famous Youtube Let’s Players such as Northernlion and Bisnap. Their unique ways of playing the game have inspired many more to try the game themselves.\n\n* Closing comments\n\nThe Binding of Isaac is a very charming (although rather macabre as well) game which is a must have for anyone interested in roguelikes. It can be obtained for 99 cents from Humble Bundles or Steam sales, DLC and awesome soundtrack included. A worthwhile play even after the release of Rebirth.","August 21, 2015","true","143.8"," 59 of 66 people (89%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","89","59","66","16","0"

This game is extremely frustrating to get the hang of. Unless you are a god, you probably can't beat it the first time you play. It took me 42 attempts to beat all six floors and Mom for the first time.\nI guarantee you will lose your temper at this game at some point.\nAnd you might have to do a bit of research on the Wiki or experimenting in-game to find out what every single trinket, activated item, passives and tarot card does and which ones are good or bad for every unlockable character.\nYou might have to take your chances with the pills, as each type is randomly paired with an ability during each run.\n\nHOWEVER!\n\nThe Binding of Isaac is not, and I repeat, NOT, a bad game. As much as it is frustrating, it is really addictive. I thoroughly recommend this to fans of dungeon-styled and bullet hell games. Despite Isaac's innocent look (which he kinda is...look at those big crying eyes!), the style of enemies, rooms and pickups can be incredibly morbid and disturbing. The cries of Mulligans and the appearance of Hives are incredibly distressing, adding to the games overall atmosphere. Nonetheless this really adds charm to the game as a whole. Bear in mind this is coming from the creators of Super Meat Boy, so expect some blood along the way. But what's fun is you never know what to expect. All of the dungeon floor layouts are randomly generated everytime you start a game and aside from Mom being the last boss in the Depths, you never know what boss you will get upon entering its room. There are set bosses for every floor type and the game will randomly select one of these for you to battle.

Having doubled my playtime in the past couple of weeks i have come to the conclusion that my initial response to the game was premature.\n\nFor those unfamiliar with Issac, the game is a Rougelike Dual Analogue Shooter. this means you controll Issac (or one of his unlocakble alternates) who fights randomly spawned monsters in a procedurely generated dungeon using his own tears as bullets. Issac is heavially inspired by retro titles, especially the original Legend of Zelda, as can be seen in the way each room is a seperate yet in many ways similar mirror of each other with some room s designated as treasure or boss rooms, and the heart based life meter.\n\nThe presentation of Issac is that of a Newgrounds flash game on steriods. To be fair that description is fairly apt. the game is built on the flash engine and if it hadn't had the time, creativity, and vision applied to it that is what it would likely have ended up as. That flash comment is not meant in the derrogative though, the game looks and sounds beautiful (Mostly thanks to Danny Baranowsky). Because it sticks to the limitations of the engine rather than attempt more realistic graphics the game looks perfect for what it is.\n\nGameplay is where Issac truly shines. The controls are simple and tight, keeping the already difficult gameplay from becoming frustrating. The best part of the gameplay though is the items. The randomly generated items ensure that no two runs are the same. These items are most awesome when they work together (Protip-Polyphimus+Technology =Awesome.). The enemies have unique attack and movement patterns that are easy to learn but will always be able to throw you for a loop.\n\nThe only problem I have with the game is the same as it was before. The random nature of the item drops and boss spawns can make some playthroughs almost instant throwaways. This is aliviated by the sortness of the game and the rapidity of the respawn but if a few games in a row with a bad start and even I get frustrated.\n\n8/10.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/noq_pl/recommended/113200/","noq_pl","·noq·","http://steamcommunity.com/id/noq_pl/","908 products in account","In short, is the game good?\nYes, yes and triple yes.\n\nIs it worth my time and money?\nYes. Considering how cheap The Binding of Isaac + Wrath of The Lamb is, there really isn't an excuse *not to buy it*. You will most definitely sink a lot of time into the game and you will have fun.\n\nIs this game for anyone?\nConsidering the quasi-random nature of the gameplay, some of the runs you will do will be a walk in the park, while others may be pure nightmare. If you do not enjoy dying and losing progress over and over, this game may not be for you. If that isn't the case, go for it.\n\nLinear, open-world or something else?\nSomething else. No two runs will ever be the same. The room layout, boss encounters, items you will get and overall difficulty are mainly dictated at random. While the set pieces themselves do not change properties that much (maybe aside meeting stronger, "champion" versions of monsters), the way it's all set up makes every run a fresh, new experience.\n\nGameplay mechanics, gimmicks?\nYou run around rooms in a 2D top-down view. You collect items that change the way your character behaves (make you faster, slower, stronger, shoot more, shoot faster, etc.). Items aren't really a necessity but without them the run may be near-impossible to do (considering the later levels where enemies deal twice as much damage and bosses have a really high level of health).\n\nGraphical aesthetics, set pieces and world design?\nThe game has a very dark and cartoony look, in some places even grotesque. Vibrant colours and simplified forms meet with dark and horror-like rooms filled with hideous monsters that look like something out of Lovecraft's or Kafka's work. All of it feels well put together and it shows that a lot of thought was put into the overall design.\n\nAudio design and soundtrack?\nExcellent choices in sound effects as well as in the music soundtrack. Church-like ambiency clashing with hard guitar riffs and sounds of all kinds of hideous monsters go well together, creating an dark atmosphere that is immersive and enjoyable.\n\nPlot, story?\nQuite unique. The top layer of the story is simple, referring to real world topics such as fundamentalism, parenting and escapism. For those brave enough to take up the challenge, the game rewards the player with a deeper meaning to the story and a bit clearer undestanding what is really going on.\n\nHow does the game run?\nI have played and "finished" (that is, got the last ending, since the game never really ends) the game on my 5 year old PC (Dual Core 2.66GHz, 2GB RAM, nVidia GeForce 9600GT) and it ran without much problems in fullscreen mode and on the "Auto" settings. There were instances where I was experiencing severe framerate issues due to the way the game was programmed (Flash has terrible issues when drawing lots of stuff at once, since it's all vector-based). This was happening in more "crowded" rooms such as bullet hell-esque boss fights. Changing the settings to "Low" eliminated the problem for me completely. So, if you have a similar PC to mine, just set the game to Low or Medium and it should be fine in fullscreen mode. If you have a newer machine, expect way better results.\n\nAny details, character, motif, etc. you particularly liked?\nYes, the D6 dice. Brings a completely new meta-game into your runs and adds a layer of careful planning.\n\nAnything you didn't like?\nYes. First of all, Flash. The game could run way better if it wasn't using Flash as a rendering engine. Then again, The Binding of Isaac was meant to be a side-project so it's understandable that the creators didn't have the time and/or resources to write a fully functional, brand new, custom engine from the ground up. Although that will probably change since The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth is set to come out not too far from now. Second, no controller support. While that's not a dealbreaker, it could've been easily patched in. Instead we see a "recomendation", in the options menu, to use Joy2Key. That's not a very professional way of doing things. On the other-hand, the game can be played without problems using a keyboard, so it's not a terribly big issue. Finally, lack of item descriptions. I understand that there's an element of learning when picking up items but a short description of what item does what would be nice. Instead, new players (along with myself) had to use the wiki to check if they want to really pick up this or that item.\n\nFinal score?\nI give The Binding of Isaac (+The Wrath of The Lamb) a Mom's Knife out of 5.","January 12, 2014","true","63.5"," 27 of 31 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","27","31","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/recommended/113200/","nerdhouse","Nerd House","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/","2628 products in account","Few games can truly claim to walk the fine line between fun and frustration as much as The Binding of Isaac, another hellishly difficult title from Edmund McMillen: the man behind Super Meat Boy. It’s a title that delights in pushing players to the point where they want to start taking swings at their computer before attempting another round guiding its titular tyke through a series of nightmarish and randomized dungeons.\n\nA brief animated intro sets up the threadbare plot: Isaac is a young boy living a happy life at home with his mom until she starts hearing the voice of God and hiding him from the evils of the world. It isn’t long until Isaac is permanently locked in his room and awaiting execution at the hands of his mother at the almighty’s behest. Escaping into the basement, Isaac begins his bizarre journey.\n\nThe Binding of Isaac somehow manages to be disturbing as it is endearing with its balance of gruesome monsters and matching setting with its adorable, wide-eyed sprites. Dungeons are splashed in every foul bodily fluid imaginable—blood, guts, tears, urine, and even an uncomfortable amount of feces. Imagine Hellraiser filmed through the lens of a Saturday morning cartoon for kids. The bestiary is equally grotesque. Armies of maggots and flies are frequent foes, and headless children spewing fountains of blood from their necks are a common sight.\n\nBosses take things a distasteful step forward: fetuses, conjoined twins, fat slugs urinating on the floor, and even Isaac’s mother are just a few of the end-level bosses that need to be dealt with. Keep in mind that the protagonist is also a perpetually-naked boy using his tears as projectiles. The Binding of Isaac is a pretty sick game with aesthetics that would appeal to one’s inner horror fan and Splatterhouse enthusiast. It isn’t going to be to everyone’s tastes, but those that enjoyed Super Meat Boy are probably going to find themselves like McMillen’s perverted sense of style.\n\nSince the dungeons are randomized, there’s no telling what you’re going to find whether it be a useful power-up or more monsters. This makes memorization of each level impossible and keeps the experience fresh every time. On the downside, this means success depends on good luck and players will often lose because they were dealt a bad hand. Every time Isaac dies, players wind up right back at the start of the game and even the most patient of individuals will become infuriated by such a design choice. After putting in so much effort and acquiring a myriad of useful abilities, it feels way too harsh.\n\nThe randomness extends to the power-ups themselves, as there are well over a hundred of them and they don’t always have the expected effect. Some even hurt Isaac and if used in a tight spot are going to guarantee death. At the very least, they can be used in conjunction with other power ups and there’s not much of a limit on how many of them can be used at the same time. Still, there’s nothing worse than getting bad power-ups and items with no end in sight. At that point, it’s probably best to just quit and start again.\n\nThere’s even some replayability to the title with extra characters that can be unlocked and a bit of exploring to see if there’s anything particularly useful in a given dungeon. The Binding of Isaac is a purposefully short title designed to be played many times over, not just due to its unforgiving nature, that will yield a surprise here and there when players think they’re seen everything. Its ability to keep you guessing is its greatest strength and weakness as it violently seesaws between an enjoyable 2D romp and unbridled frustration.\n\nThe Binding of Isaac is not for those that are easily deterred, and it’s a safe bet that any Super Meat Boy fans are going to sink their teeth into it. For such a small title, there’s a lot of content packed into it and it’s an experience that isn’t always the same from one playthrough to the next. Players will question whether it was their own skill that carried them through to the end or if it was sheer luck, but regardless of the difficulty it’s an approachable game with a unique charm that boils blood just as easily as it encourages laughter at Isaac’s cartoonish spectacle of childhood trauma.\n\nA Must Play\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","November 24, 2014","true","19.6"," 46 of 66 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","46","66","0","0"

The game’s storyline and name are both a reference to the Biblical story known also as Binding of Isaac. In the game, the player controls Isaac, a child that seeks safety in the basement after his mother is given a message of God commanding her to sacrifice her own son in order to proof her faith. In the basement Isaac starts going through dungeons located in the basement having to face his nightmares in form of monsters, in order to escape.\n\n\nThe style and game’s gameplay are inspired by Legend of Zelda series and similar to roguelike, where the rooms of all dungeons are randomly generated, being different each time you play, and this is what makes it so special because every gameplay is totally different. On each floor of the basement, the player must kill monsters in order to proceed to the next room. Along the way, it will be possible to collect keys weapons and power-ups which will increase your chance of surviving because each item has a special effect and you can also pick up coins which are used to buy items in shops spread all over each floor, but need a key to be opened.\nEach floor of the dungeon ends with a boss room, where a boss must be defeated in order to proceed to the next floor. Each time the bosses are different. At loading screens between floors, Isaac remembers scenarios, of his childhood while crying in fetal position, from rejection of his mother, unlucky moments and even bullying from his friends, some can even be Isaac’s own fears, but you’ll never know.\nThe gameplay is easy to master since does not require very buttons and the soundtrack is not diverse, but it does fit very well the atmosphere of the game.\n\nOne of the most awesome features of this game, in my opinion, and because due to flash limitation, it’s not possible to save, all your unlockables will stay unlocked and such, but you cannot save mid-game, so you will have to start over every time you go back to main menu, every time you lose and every time you close the game. And that is what makes it so hard and enjoyable since you will not get bored because every time all will be different and new!\nA DLC to the game was also released, “Wrath of the Lambs”, also a religious reference, and it adds all new content including new items, new rooms, new enemies, new bosses and its totally worth it!\n\n\nThis game has me craving for more every time I play it, the creativity of it is amazing and it will make you spend some good long hours playing it. I totally recommend you to get it.\n\n\n~ 9/10\n\n\nP.s: Brace yourselfes, the remake is here!","October 13, 2014","true","62.6"," 36 of 49 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","36","49","0","1"

Each time you go to the next level, you are met with different enemies, and all new opportunities to get items. And just when you think you've beat the game...you haven't. I'll let you figure out what that means.\n\nThe items, enemies, rooms, and level layouts are completely random, so you will likely never have the same exact experience in this game twice. Unlocking new characters adds to the experience, as each one has its own benefits and setbacks, making the game easier in some ways and harder in others. Because of the overwhelming amount of items and enemies, I'd always recommend playing with the wiki for the game open, just so that you never make a bad decision when it comes to picking up items. Still, some things in this game come with a learning curve and you'll just have to find out what items you like to use and which ones will make you rage.\n\nIt'll be frustrating at first, but once you unlock more items and beat your own personal records, you'll be addicted. Buying the Wrath of the Lamb DLC makes the game even tougher (so I suggest buying it after you have a good feel for the base game), but adds loads of new content, including enemies, items, levels, and more.\n\nHonestly, I'd recommend this game to anyone I knew, even with all of the dark humor and blasphemous jokes. When you look past all of that, it's a great game with excellent replay value.","October 14, 2014","true","160.4"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","2"

You start off as Isaac, a kid whose christian mom decides to sacrifice to Jesus because of reasons, so you run off to your basement to avoid the imminent slaughter. However you soon find out that it is not safe there either, and pave your way to salvation by shooting random monsters with your tears as you progress through the basement's labyrinthine array of rooms. Several power-ups and mom's items (and pills) help you in this battle, while you unlock more of them as well as several other characters with different abilities as you progress in the game. Of course,  you have no idea what each item does when you pick it up and I personally found fun in discovering different items along the way. The binding of Isaac's unique dark humor and artwork have made it instantly recognisable and strangely lovable among other titles of its genre. However it is a difficult and unforgiving game that will send you to your death time an time again.\n\n\n+ Twisted -wtf- humor\n+ Loads of randomly generated items\n+ Cool soundtrack\n+ Great artwork\n\n- Can be really hard, especially with the wrath of lamb DLC\n","September 29, 2014","true","45.2"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/difficult-/recommended/113200/","difficult-","nood","http://steamcommunity.com/id/difficult-/","899 products in account","Best FPS of 2011, even now, this game has given me many hours of happiness as well as rage following by depression.\n\nThis is the game you have to buy. Do not finish reading this review, just run out and get it right now. You will have plenty of time to read while you sit through the game's seemingly never-ending opening scene. It is the best opening scene I have ever seen, but you have no choice: it is The Binding of Isaac, the most important game of the year(2011), follow-up to the greatest shooter ever made next to Call of Duty or Battlefield, and you need it.\n\nAfter a headache-inducing five-hour unskippable opening scene, I thought it might not be fair to play the game in such a foul mood. Yet I was entranced within two minutes as the protagonist, a fake NEET named Isaac, arrived under the basement, a cozy and super comfortable place, perfect for playing hours of video-games & watching Chinese cartoons. Not to mention the super loud asian music playing in the background on full volume.\n\nWith expressive eyes and emotive faces, the Mobs look far more real than those in any other game. The effect is weakest when monsters smile, which makes them look slightly ill, so it is just as well that there is little reason for cheer.\n\nThe oppressed monsters/bugs living in the same basement have formed an underground resistance, which is constantly trying to kill Isaac as he tries to reach 7,000 MMR in Dota 2. Isaac is greeted as a savior by those familiar with his unbeatable microskills from the first game. He battles monsters and bugs as he makes his way out of the trench to the next International.\n\nThe Rebirth (sequel to Isaac) was like the film directed by Michael Bay. In that it did not do a lot that was really new, but did beautifully encapsulate the best elements of its medium. Isaac remains true to its heritage, adding popular features of other games such as the ability to fire lasers or to wear bras which freezes enemies for few seconds. The game also preserves the original's basic structure, in which your first weapon is a AWP, just like any counter-strike fanboy and you slowly gain a light saber, a NERF and eventually a rocket launcher made in China, although these more powerful weapons are counterbalanced by more powerful enemies.\n\nBut more notable than Rebirth's similarities to its predecessor are its differences. Sequels, like the recent Advanced Warfare and Mario Kart 8, are often little more than modified versions of the originals. Advanced Warfare is a straight-ahead shooter with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ battles and edgy pay-2-win weapon skins, just like Ghost. Mario Kart 8 lets the player gradually explore more of the RAMBO environment through acquiring the same set of capabilities you gathered in Mario Kart 7. Both games are excellent and true to their successors, but they play essentially the same.\n\nThe Binding of Isaac has the most varied gameplay of any shooter since World of Warcraft, with strikingly distinctive challenges. In one, you drop piles of poop, occasionally collecting hearts or coins. In a later mission, you will probably still be doing the same thing but the replay value is still endless!\n\nOne of the original Isaac's biggest achievement was the way it seamlessly provided purpose and a context for all the violence, keeping you from feeling as though you were just running around randomly shooting stuff like in Call of Duty. Rebirth does the same thing, choreographing events in a way that keeps you enthralled and on track.\n\nYet, while Rebirth offers a denser plot and more distinct characters, the story is ultimately less involving. The game only drop hints as to cause this grim future and never bothers to explain the motivation of your main foe, NEET basement's monsters & bugs.\n\nOther video games have told stories better than Isaac, but then, besides graphics, Isaac is arguably more effective in some ways than other games. It was more sacier than Doom 3. Monsters showed a more convincing artificial intelligence than in Far Cry. Singleplayer mode battles were carried out more smoothly than ♥♥♥♥♥♥ team-based games like Dota that requires you to yell at autists. Not to mention it had a more original structure.\n\nYet no other game does as many things as well as Isaac; I had so much fun that I can forgive the game its abysmal ending. I was continually enthralled and amazed, and would rather replay Isaac than begin a new first-person shooter. I envy those of you who are about to experience Isaac for the first time. Although I pity you for having to watch the never ending opening.","January 20, 2015","true","822.4"," 25 of 37 people (68%) found this review helpful 22 people found this review funny","68","25","37","22","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PsychoticSnivy/recommended/113200/","PsychoticSnivy","The Psychotic Snivy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PsychoticSnivy/","134 products in account","Time to write a serious review (pfft serious) now that Valve added this review thing. Kay.\n\nSo, I've always been the kind to really despise games where you win based off of luck and luck alone. And yet, this game does rely on luck, but not to the point where it's all you'll win based off of. A bit of skill is involved, in dodging shots and movement, knowing when to pick items, and when to ditch them. The game play is always randomized, so you never know what you're going to get unless you're using a seed in Spidermod. Anyhow, I'm gonna split this review into two main parts, and then extra things. Plot, gameplay, and then anything extra I'd like to add.\n\nPlot: The plot of this game is simple, yet it makes enough sense to be a plot. To keep it short, some little kid named Isaac's mother hears the voice of god, saying how corrupt with sin Isaac is, and eventually God tells his mother to kill Isaac in sacrifice. Simple, but pretty messed up. And in escape, Isaac jumps into the basement, unknowing of what's below. Overall, it's a plot, it makes sense, and it ties into the game. Yeah. I personally like how simple the plot is. Just my opinion.\n\nGameplay: Now, for the gameplay, you're thrown into a randomly generated dungeon, and it plays top-down, similar to the Legend of Zelda for NES. You're armed with nothing more than your own tears at first, and have to cry your enemies to death. The controls are explained to you in the first room, with no tutorial, and you're off. Following the doors, you might find some room with a crown on it, known as a treasure room. You can gain items to become more powerful. For example, you might get more firerate on your tears, some laser you can fire instead of tears, you might upgrade your damage, or even your HP. Speaking of HP, when you first play, Isaac will start out with three hearts. On hit, your health goes down, obviously. Red hearts replenish health. However, you can earn blue hearts, and these blue hearts can go ABOVE your max health. However, once you lose them, these soul hearts, they're gone. Anyhow, throughout more exploration, you might find a dark, ominous-looking door. This is the boss room, where you fight the boss of the floor, and after it's defeated, you move on to the next floor. However, if you die, it's back to the beginning with you. A very true rogue-like game. I'll leave the rest for you to figure out, granted you purchase this game.\n\nAnything extra: The soundtrack. Nothing much more to say than it's amazing. Yeah. Also, this game is NOT for the weak of stomach, for there is a LOT of blood/gore.\n\nFinal remarks: Overall, The Binding of Isaac is a VERY fun, and enjoyable game. Death happens a ton, and you're going to get used to it. The gameplay's fun, yet challenging, the plot's very...odd, but still good, and the soundtrack is just amazing.\n9.5/10.\n\n","December 3, 2013","true","115.3"," 16 of 21 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","16","21","0","0"

The player will take control of Isaac, a crying naked young boy trying to escape the basement of his home. Isaacs mother, instructed by god to take his life as a test of faith, is the final boss in the game. Each level is a unique randomly generated dungeon, with 6 to 10 rooms and a boss fight. There are six playable characters that can be unlocked, and more than a hundred different items to discover and use during each random adventure. The gameplay is simple, consisting of dodging enemies attacks and firing Isaacs tears and dropping bombs as a means of offense. The game has a dark sort of humor about it, with each stage seeming to become more and more dangerous and depressing for little Isaac. The gameplay is solid, though the story is quite simple. There are no NPC's, no quests, and no real RPG-like qualities. It is a simple and entertaining romp with a high degree of difficulty, that requires a fair ammount of luck. Created by Edmund McMillen and Florian Himsl, The Binding of Isaac is beloved amongst fans of indie games and dungeon crawlers because of its pick-up-and-play nature and simple setup. For casual players, the game will find a place as a quick and easy shoot-em-up that passes time. Hardcore completionists will have plenty to work for, with a collection system that tracks every item the player has found and many varying and difficult achievements and characters to unlock. The game is single player only, and derives much of its value from the procedurally-generated levels and humorous yet difficult gameplay. If you'd like to see some gameplay, check out AGNBs Let's Play series.\n\nPROS: Easy to learn, fun to play, lots to discover\nCONS: Very difficult, inherently repetitive\n\nGRAPHICS: 3/5 - Originally a flash game, and it shows.\nSOUND: 5/5 - Perfectly fitting soundtrack and SFX.\nSTORY: 3/5 - Not a lot in the story department, but not much is needed.\nGAMEPLAY: 5/5 - Highly addicting "just one more try" style gameplay.\nREPLAY VALUE: 5/5 - I find myself returning to it again and again.

It's not repetitive in any way, which I value in an indie/rogue-like games and it's incredibly satisfying to beat the game. Especially for the very first time. Just. Trust me.\nThere is just so much in this game, secrets, treasures, that it's a bit over-whelming. It's like: you think you know a lot about the game (leave alone 'know everything about the game'), but I can almost guarantee that you don't.\nOh and it's based mostly around religious stuff and God and Satan and a bit more Satan.

I don't know what it is, but the procedural generation of dungeons and items so different from each other that they actually change the gameplay is what makes this game unique.\nBrought to you by the creators of Super Meat Boy and a personal favorite Aether (check it out if you don't know it), this game is an arcade-like dungeon-exploring with progression based on repetition. Some may hate the fact that you need to kill the first boss about eight times to unlock the second boss, and you need to kill the second main boss some times to unlock the third boss, and so on.\nPersonally I don't mind that sort of thing, specially due to the random factor that affects the items you get. A lot is based on LUCK, since there are items that are far above others in quality and power, but overall the game is very balanced and you can get a kick out of it no matter the hand you are dealt.\nSystem of achievements, items and challenges is what marks the progression of this game, besides the number of times you defeated the bosses. Each challenge is unique and sets you with a made up combo of items (or no item at all), and it is a great thing to have for end-game players.\nOverall, this game is one of my favorites of all time, and I couldn't be more excited for the release of the reboot, Binding of Isaac: Rebirth.

The gameplay is pretty simple. a 3/4ths top down shooter that allows you to shoot in 4 directions. There are also alternate power ups and bombs to use. Really simple controls like Smash TV mixed with Zelda. You are Isaac, stuck in a multi leveled dungeon. Each one of these dungeon levels is in the old Zelda 1 style where each room is 1 screen. The dungeons / basements are randomized, every room and enemy combination is randomly generating. The gameplay is fun and addictive. The only downside is no lives, no continues. There are tons of quirky weapons, enemies, power ups and bosses. Everyone should spend the $5 to play this game.\n\nI can understand if its not for everyone, because it is an arcadey retro Zelda 1 meets Smash TV sort of game. The graphics are cute and charming, but portray horrifying things like if you were to ever see a doodle of a fetus or a doodle of someone coughing out flies and poop staining the floor. Like a sad disparagingly sort of awesome. You play as Issac who basically has to get out of randomized Zelda style dungeons. There are dozens of unique enemies with different attack styles. Few enemies seem to have predictable patterns. There are also plenty of boss battles.\n\nThe controls take some getting used to, but they are basically Smash TV controls. You use your directional pad, then you use an attack direction. So you can move right and shoot left or up, or down or right. You have a bomb button, a special findable item and an auxiliary power up button for things like pills. The main attack are bullets... which are really tears. Bombs sit, but you can push them, pills do good and bad things. Some items / power ups give you dolls for extra weapons, or a dead cat gives you 9 lives but the catch is you have 1 heart energy per life. You can also get metal hearts, that count as energy, but once they're gone you can't get them back like normal heart healths.\n\nYou play through 'basement' floor after floor marked with a boss at the end. You find keys, bomb walls, kill enemies, gamble, visit stores, danger rooms and so on. Just like Zelda 1. The only thing is that it is all randomized. The room layouts are randomized, the rooms themselves are randomized, the stores, the weapons, the items.\n\nIt is all randomized, so you'll never play the same game twice. This isn't a story based game, so it won't appeal to everyone. Its highly entertaining especially in short bursts of play. For that price, you can't miss this game.\n\nI highly recommend the game for its gameplay, cheap price and its never the same game twice with the random dungeons.","August 11, 2012","true","14.4"," 14 of 20 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","14","20","0","0"

Mostly glitches that it introduces such as enemies glitching through some corners, not properly working Brimstone controls, etc. but with all the new game elements you can easily forget about this.\n\nPS. Gorgeous soundtrack if you don't know it yet.\n\n\nEspañol:\n\nDespues de 108 horas al fin he completado al 100% The Binding of Isaac + la expansion Wrath of the Lamb (los 84 logros).\nLa cantidad de horas que puedes echarle hasta que no tienes nada mas que hacer es simplemente increible dado el precio por el que puedes comprar el pack con el juego y la expansion (0.99 rebajado).\n\nSi nunca has jugado al juego puedes esperar acabarlo completamente en mas de 150-200 horas (dependiendo de tu habilidad en este tipo de juego).\n\nA los nuevos jugadores probablemente les resulte dificil y mas aun con el contenido de la expansion, asi que recomendaria jugar sin ella instalada (en la pestaña DLC de las propiedades del juego) al menos hasta que hayas desbloqueado It Lives o superado Sheol una vez. Despues de eso estaras preparado para los nuevos enemigos y jefes, y apreciaras mas los nuevos objetos y los trinkets.\n\nLa expansion tiene algunos inconvenientes como glitches que introduce del tipo enemigos que traspasan algunas esquinas, los controles del objeto Brimstone no funcionan muy bien, etc. pero con la cantidad de nuevos elementos en el juego uno se puede olvidar perfectamente de esto.\n\nPD.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/HSquirrel/recommended/113200/","HSquirrel","HalfSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/HSquirrel/","66 products in account","Binding of Isaac is one of the best games I've played on Steam. It has the right level of difficulty, an interesting base story, and a lot of secrets to uncover. Being able to play as a bunch of different characters, all with different stats and starting items, and random items every time you play through the game, makes the game extremely fun and random. Some runs will work, some won't and a lot does depend on luck, but even in a run where you haven't been particularly lucky you still have a chance to pull it off if you fit in a bit of skill.\n\nThis is one of the first games I played on Steam, and I didn't really enjoy it at first. I sucked at it, and couldn't even get to the first Mom fight. Eventually though, as I played the game more, I got better and learned how to deal with the various enemies. I learned advantages and disadvantages of picking up certain items, and which items were OP so I could hope for one of those. The wiki really helped a lot at the beginning to help me learn the items, of which there are over 100 each with different effects.\n\nThough I believe it's intentional for some characters to be more difficult to play than others, it's not a feature I can fully appreciate. I like when all the characters in a game are balanced, which could have been very possible in BoI but some characters are still distinctly worse than others.\n\nThis game also takes a long while to get the hang of. At first, I played about 2 hours of this game then quit and didn't play again for almost a year. I was then reintroduced to the game, and I started playing it a lot more. It still took me another long time (maybe 40-50 hours) to beat mom for the first time, and then 100 more hours on top of that to beat ??? at the end of the game. It takes practice and patience to finally beat the game, but it's worth every minute of it.\n\nThe DLC for this game is definitely required. Wrath of the Lamb adds so much important content and it's not nearly as fun without it. There are significantly fewer items, less end-game content, less enemies, and a lot less fun to be had. Although, with or without the DLC, Binding of Isaac is easily worth the price you pay for it at any time. $8 is nothing compared to the amount of fun you will have playing this game.","July 4, 2014","true","209.3"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

While the artstyle is very cartoony it still has some disturbing imagery and grotesque designs. That being said, this childlike portayal of such menacing sights offers a very interesting visual presentation for the game.\n\nThe proof, however, lies in the playing. This begs the question of how well The Binding of Isaac's gameplay holds up. For being such a simple idea initially to shoot baddies while avoiding being shot yourself a surprising amount of complexity is added with its varied item combinations. One game session you may find yourself becoming a flying demon spitting unforgiving lasers from hell, while in the next you may be stuck peeing on enemies as your only form of self defence. The game also does an okay job of ramping up the difficulty as the player progresses.\n\nIn conclusion, give this game a spin if you can spare the money and you can handle its graphical style. You may also want to consider picking up the expansion Wrath of the Lamb, it makes it even better.","December 30, 2013","true","141.8"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

Delusional interpretation manifests in, among others, grandiosity, feeling of a mission, delusions of guilt and sin (the latter being transferred to her child). These result in inappropriate and irresponsible actions which jeopardize the safety of her son, Isaac.\nIsaac, trying to cope with the family situation, is facing his worst childhood subconscious fears. Subconsciousness is traditionally represented as 'basement' (similarly to e.g. Hitchcock's Psycho). His weapon in fighting those fears is crying and thus, relieving negative emotions. As Isaac goes deeper into the subconscious cleansing himself in a psychoanalytical way, he discovers his most concealed desire - to kill his mom.\n\nShort version:\n\nIt's the only game that your wife will encourage you to play.","January 19","true","59.0"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","7","8","2","0"

The game has moved over to Afterbirth, Which is the far smoother running, more expansive and currently supported replacement. If you were looking to get this instead, I recommend you don't because it most likely will run like crap.\n\nEDIT: Since it's evidentally not clear in my review, Afterbirth is not a sequal... it's an addon to the remake (rebirth) using something other than flash. Since flash couldn't handle the original. You will still get all the same story elements by playing afterbirth.

If you are curious what you are getting into it, it's something strangely familiar and incredibly well made. It is basically a top down shooter reminescent of old Zelda games (my favorite kind) with roguelike elements and some twisted humor.\n\n*On a side note: buy the DLC, I don't need to add why, its everything you love topped with more of what you love.\n\nRoguelikes have been making a resurgence lately as part of the revisionist mantra of "real gamers like hardcore challenges". Which is all well and good, sure I like to be challenged in certain ways, but I definitely like to relax too. More importantly it's not just any challenge that gamers should clamor for, it's the good kind, the fair kind. Team Meat has this down perfectly. When ever you die in one of their games it's not a question of a flaw in the game's design, an enemy that is overpower, or an impossible obstacle, the only the wrong is you. The game has a simple set of mechanics and some secrets in gameplay that you can and should figure out on your own. When you lose in this game you should feel that welcome brand of shame that says "I should've known better". This game isn't trying to fool, you know what you are playing and you know what you should've done.\n\nThe real draw from a game that is continously killing you, besides the superb gamplay, is the sense of progress and reward. There is a plethora of secrets to be found in The Binding of Isaac, all unlocked in a variety of ways and adding to the gameplay. The game starts with Isaac, there are more characters to unlock later, shooting tears and running around naked. From defeating bosses, random chests, or treasure rooms, Isaac unlocks various items that alter his abilities. Most of the abilities are passive and stack, and some are useable abilities like cards or a cat's head. These items are all random ( a treasure may net you a spiffy spider upgrade to your tears or just a teleporter) and the levels are procedurally generated. On top of all  the game altering the items can do, they also change your character's appearance into something that is usually atrocious and hilarious.\n\nThe Binding of Isaac will kill you a lot (and not in the Dark Souls way where  you can still get something back and respawn from the last campfire), but you will never feel like it was a waste. I've had some two minute sessions of this game that netted me a new secret item, and there is always something to unlock in The Binding of Isaac. After dying so many times you will get better, and then you will still keep dying, but you'll enjoy it.\n\n","August 2, 2013","true","179.0"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","5","5","2","0"

Each level is randomly generated and death is permanent; you never know what's in store for you when you start it up. Though dying sucks, you'll still likely feel a sense of achievement as you go deeper into the story and unlock more content. I highly recommend having the wiki open while playing, as there are a ton of items with different and obscure effects. I'd also like to suggest playing the base game for a bit before activating the Wrath of the Lamb DLC. It's a fun and compelling game that's just hard enough to make you want to give it another shot, over and over again. Once you've completed some achievements, you can even change youre starting character. The soundtrack is astounding and the enemies are creative. 10/10\nBecause "The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth" is coming out soon, it's probably wise to wait and see if that's any good before buying this. It's supposed to have a lot of new features. The fact that Rebirth exists doesn't make this game any less good but if you can only buy one, you should know you're getting the best.","September 28, 2014","true","72.5"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

If you can look past the cartoonish art style and simplistic look then you'll see a really expansive game with tonnes to find and do.\n\nNow first things first: this game is hard. You will spend a lot of your time dying, dying and dying again. If you're gonna whine about a difficult unforgiving game, then don't get this. When you die, that's game over. You start again at the beginning with nothing.\n\nAlong your journey you'll find a total over 235 items which upgrade your character. I'd say this is what actually makes the game shine, all the items are randomized so every time you play through it, you'll get different items which change how you play. A really nice touch is that the items also change your character's appearance, which is a visually pleasing change.\n\nOne issue I have with this is that there's usually no indication as to what the items actually do. Unless you have a wiki open whilst you're playing, you're gonna have a bad time. It would have been nice if they at least included an in-game encyclopaedia.\n\nBecause all the items are randomized, a lot of this game is down to luck which decides whether or not you actually have a successful game which kinda sucks. Overall, considering it's really cheap and a fun game, it gets a 6 out of 10 so pick it up if you have the money!","January 20, 2014","true","8.0"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Binding of isaac tells a horrific story with a multitude of disturbing elements that leave you wondering what the designer was thinking when he made this, but whatever he did, it's done in such a way that it gets to people in the best way possible\n\nBinding of isaac is an exploration based adventure with an extremely well thought out progression system, numerous random elements and all that other goodness. The core gameplay can be summed up as "easy to learn, hard to master" and the Wrath of the Lamb DLC once again proves this to be a solid statement.\n\nCurrently the remake is in progress, but this is what started it, and this is what set the standards for similar games in it's genre. Hardcore roguelike elements and a variety of wacky and impressive in game items provide a fresh experience for a loooong time, with a permadeath mechanic that leaves you on the tip of your chair and wanting more and more each time.\n\nTo sum up this gem of a game, it's now on sale for an all time low. Less than 2 bucks gets you this beauty of a game and the expansion, but in the end it's priceless.\n\nNo one will regret picking this up. From the die hards to the softcores, there's a place for everyone in the basement >:)","September 28, 2014","true","73.5"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

It has many Bible references, those make the game more mysterious and interesting. Not willing to spoil anything, but it's more like how Isaacs life turned into hell. He just lived a happy, joyful and simple life with his Mother in a small house on a hill. But one day Isaacs Mom heard a voice from above.. The God tells his Mother to prove her faith in him by sacrificing Isaac.\n\nThe gameplay reminded me a lot of Zelda games - Bombs: used to break rocks, kill enemies and cut Your way through closed doors if needed. Coins: Used to play slot machines, buy items and etc. Keys: Unlock treasure rooms and other locked doors. It is also a very random, no two runs are the same, random pick-ups and enemies. Variety of items - over 250 items! every collectible You pick will be shown on Your character. Make Your shots (tears) stronger by collecting those items to defeat more difficult bosses, make Your Character faster by collecting other types of items, to dodge enemy attacks and so on! I'm definitely recommending it! You won't regret! The soundtrack is also very nice and fits the game. Many endings will keep You satisfied to play more, even if You die (Death is permanent in game).\n\nBut the game has a deeper meaning to it, wayy deeper, it is what it makes so original and very different, from the other games, even games from the same creator. Yes, it is sad and You'll understand it once You've beaten the game 10th time..\n\nHave a nice time playing this amazing game!\n\n-Circumflex","November 29, 2013","true","56.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","1"

You play as Isaac, a young boy who is being hunted by his mother, who is on a mission from "God" to sacrifice Isaac. You travel through a series of randomly-generated basements and caves, collecting a huge variety of power-ups on your way. The religious themes in Binding are a breath of fresh air, providing some provoking, yet subtle storytelling as you play. The soundtrack as composed by Danny Baranowsky, who had collaborated previously with Edmund McMillen on the critically-acclaimed platformer, Super Meat Boy. Baranowsky created an amazing, metal soundtrack with a few ambient tracks as well. All the music fits the gameplay perfectly.

A devilish little roguelike wrapped up in a highly-interpretive commentary on relgion and religious iconography with a lot of inspiration from The Legend of Zelda and Robotron/Smash TV style gameplay. The sheer variety of items to find and combine and the massive amount of enemy types and bosses you'll come across make the game's super low price for entry seem almost insane, and even when the game starts asking for multiple playthroughs to finally see the "true end" it somehow still keeps tossing new things at you to fight and play with.\n\nThat said, I don't feel that the game is immediately rewarding and doesn't always make the best of first impressions. The artstyle may not be your thing, the four-way firing mechanics and low rate of fire can make it difficult to really get started, and the heavy reliance on random elements won't always gel with everyone, especially when the game spawns rooms where not taking damage is impossible. It can take a while for The Binding of Isaac to really grab you, and for some it may just never happen.\n\nIf it does manage to grab you though, you're in for an almost endlessly replayable little treat that just keeps giving and giving. It's also highly recommended that you get as much as you want or can out of the vanilla game before investing in the DLC.","March 2, 2014","true","79.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rapturepanic/recommended/113200/","rapturepanic","RapturePanic","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rapturepanic/","3529 products in account","Much like the other offerings from Edmund McMillen, The Binding of Isaac is not for the faint of heart or those who are easily discouraged, frustrated, or require a constant, guiding hand to have a good time. The Binding of Isaac will kill you, a lot, over and over, without mercy. However, the genius of its game design beckons to a bygone era where reward and punishment come purely from reflexes, understanding the game mechanics, how enemies move and fight, and a proper utilization of the tools at hand. Because of this design philosophy, Isaac will demand that you play again and again, slowly honing your skill and understanding until you no longer feel small and defenseless. The game can seem impossibly difficult upon first sitting, yet once the wisdom of time accumulates those impossible bosses will suddenly seem like easy prey compared to the horrors you now contend with on the deeper levels.\n\nMechanically, Isaac suffers slightly from its roots as a Flash based game, denying us some of the features and options we have come to expect even from an indie game. However, the gameplay is still brilliant enough to warrant attention and the gameplay is often spot on. Isaac catches and keeps attention with a reliance on perma-death and random pick-ups which can drastically alter how the game is played. One moment you are shooting ineffective tears at enemies, the next you are firing screen extending lasers, the next you are soaring over pits and obstructions with angelic wings. There is enough constant variety available in every play through to keep the game refreshing even on the two-hundredth run, compounded by the introduction of new bosses, deeper levels, new playable characters, and more powerful and interesting bonuses unlocked upon your continued successes.\n\nBeyond the addictive gameplay, McMillen has crafted an art style which is often both beautiful and disturbing. The cartoony characterizations mask the devious implications of many of the enemies and items as well as softening the harsh blows presented by the sheer constant brutality of your actions. There is something about Isaac that gets into your head, a fact not discounted by the catchy, haunting music constantly calling you ever further into the abyss. It is not unreasonable to say that Isaac is not a game you can pick up over a weekend, beat, and then forget; on the contrary it will call to you in the waking world, offering one more game, one more chance to redeem all your failed attempts, one more opportunity to immerse yourself in its twisted, witty, and beautiful world.","November 27, 2013","true","59.1"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","10","16","0","2"

In the same way as meat boy, Binding of Isaac also has an flawless sountrack composed by Danny B. with kudos to boss themes.\n\nThe only "bad" aspect of the game i can think is that when you die you have to start all over again, which can get frustrating after a while, but what is a good game without it's difficulty?\n\nOverall 10/10","November 25, 2013","true","87.8"," 13 of 22 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","13","22","0","1"

It takes the well-known gameplay of The Legend of Zelda and manages to make it in to a sickeningly twisted, difficult yet fun experience. There might be a few problems with the fact that it was made in Flash (something which I admit can cause problems later on), but the game actually runs well for the most part. Florian's programming, Edmund's art, and Danny's music are what make this game the biblical and potentially offensive experience this game aims to deliver.\n\nThis game can be ridiciously difficult at times. As with games of the "rogue-lite" genre, random chance can affect whether you breeze through the levels or not. It can be very unforgiving at times, which can lead to hilarious and frustrating deaths.","December 30, 2013","true","166.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It is just the way it is balanced without even trying to be balanced that makes it really hard and challenging in a dumb, but clever way and any change to any of the mechanics or rates would basicly have the potential to blow up the whole thing. Giving yourself 6 completely random items via spidermod at the very start of the game will nearly always get you a decent set of stuff that is not overpowered and not underpowered- giving yourself 8 or more items will ultimately overpower you in most occasions. I skipped the treasure rooms in these spidermod-runs by the way to make it fair and it was a proof to me that somehow Isaac became a very very complex box of stuff interacting with each other in a very catching way, making you wanna try out new combinations, playstyles, etc. You can play the game super safe for example - or you can just rush it and play sloppy as hell - it doesn't matter. Once you got used to the controls, found out what the items do and basicly go with the flow of the game you can make your own exceptions in playstyle and challenge-stuff. It's a little like maths I guess, but with much more luck involved.","March 27, 2014","true","581.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The narrative is essentially your struggle as a small naked child, who is trapped in a dungeon, as your mother comes looking for you to kill you. On top of that the game has some very heavy and very dark biblical references.\n\nWhat really makes 'The Binding of Isaac' a good game though isn't one individual element, its how it all ties together so well to match up thematically bringing together a really compelling experience. The dark overall themes, the random levels with unknown monsters and power up that always keep you on your toes, the music and art design ensuring that you know this is a giant metaphor for a trip through the seven layers of hell. At the end of the day though I know that the 'The Binding of Isaac' isn't for everyone, if you like retro games like Contra then you should get this otherwise stay away because the very reason that makes this game good (a perfect side scrolling shooter true to the genre) is the same reason that people will hate it. Its a matter of taste and you really should be taking some of the blame if you have no idea what you like and don't like by now.\n\nIf you want to read a longer review you can find it here on my blog: http://mouseandcontroller.blogspot.com/2014/07/the-binding-of-isaac.html.","July 20, 2014","true","41.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/phantom2450/recommended/113200/","phantom2450","phantom2450","http://steamcommunity.com/id/phantom2450/","564 products in account","The Binding of Isaac is an addictive twin-stick shooter that rejuvenated the roguelike genre and gifts players with a memorable gaming experience, though it is thoroughly hampered by technical flaws, creative limitations and the existence of a wholly-superior successor.\n\nIn Isaac, you play as the titular character, a five-year-old boy, fleeing from his homicidal mother throughout the realms that exist beneath his basement. Isaac uses his tears as bullets to fire at enemies. He's aided by items, trinkets, pills and cards that he finds along the way, which further disfigure him until he is almost unrecognizable by the end of the game. The full game can be beat on average in under an hour - this is the staple element of the "roguelike" genre, which developer Edmund McMillen implemented in Isaac, effectively resurrecting the genre among the indie game market. Roguelikes are exceptionally short, but are also permadeath, meaning that a character's death is absolute. Finally, each playthrough of the game is randomly generated, with no two playthroughs featuring the same items, bosses and floor layouts. This all effectively means that Isaac is infinitely replayable, for there is always the motivation of finding undiscovered, superpowerful item combinations to keep players coming back.\n\nThe unique thematic styles that the game contains provides an experience that can be quite subjective and polarizing, though those coming in with open minds find that they enjoy Isaac's charm over time. The game has significant connection to the Christian faith: the title of the game, the names of the characters (minus one) and many items contain references to the contents of the Bible. Though these references are not explicitly sacriligious, considering the context of the game (surrounded by a naked crying child and rooms full of poop) and its lore (with divine intervention driving Isaac's mother to hunt him down), those who are deeply devout may be turned off by the game's subject matter. The music is somber and melancholic, underscoring Isaac's desperation throughout his journey. Overarching visual presentation possesses an air of artistry, due to the models of characters and enemies being hand-drawn by developer Edmund McMillen, then being directly transplanted into the game. The wide variety of sizes and styles for enemies and item effects allows players to internalize what certain things do, which in turn paves the way for strategic deveopment and improved play upon practice.\n\nThe issues that this game faces are great in number, and cannot be solely attributed to the game's genre. Technologically, the game has faults that could even lead it to being described as "broken". The limitations of the Flash medium the game was designed on is often attributed as the cause of framerate issues, as well as cases of the game freezing while loading certain levels, the latter of which has become so well-known in the community that it even has its own name ("the Pink Glitch"). The in-game stat screen on the pause menu is known to misrepresent the actual stats of the player, and either way is too vague to be useful. Some item descriptions outright lie to the player, and at least one item and one trinket are known to either do nothing or solely harm the player. There are some interactions that allow the player to fall to negative health. Though these facets harm most players, there is an interesting metagame that exists in the Isaac community that calls for exploitation of known bugs and synergies to literally "break the game", by getting every item available or forcing the game to crash while trying to get there. What is arguably more dissappointing than these technical issues are the ample lack of synergies. Though some basic tear modifiers can stack on in large numbers to create crazy effects, the strongest items in the game that change your attack from tears to another format largely cancel each other out upon pickup, with invisible stat changes the only possible outcome. The game punted its opporunity to become great by neglecting to implement synergies to so many combinations.\n\nDespite the aforementioned issues, Isaac was still the standard-bearer for the roguelike genre and was a phenominally popular game. However, it has been dethroned by its own reimagining: The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth. This recent successor was developed by a new development team and has addressed the numerous technical and synergistic issues noted above. Though the game is not perfect, it is far superior to the original Isaac on virtually all levels. Therefore, in consideration of buyers' finances, if you're new to the franchise then get Rebirth. However, on its own, this is still a brilliantly-conceived title with engaging gameplay and an indefinite lifespan. Considering the price for the original is often so low on the Internet, it may still even be worth purchase now. The Binding of Isaac gets a C+.","December 31, 2014","true","96.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cyaitri/recommended/113200/","cyaitri","Cyaitri","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cyaitri/","175 products in account","The Binding of Isaac Game Review\n\nThe binding of Isaac is a indie rogue-like platformer game about a child called Isaac and his crazy religious mother. It is a game filled with secrets and unlockable characters and items with 2 DLC packs. After playing The Binding of Isaac for a few hours I realised there was a reason so many people described the game as “Unforgiving” and “disturbing”, It’s because its filled with satanic references, blood and gore. Not only that but The Binding of Isaac is incredibly difficult, only after my first 10 tries was I able to kill mom once. My favourite thing about The Binding of Isaac would have to be the game breaking aspect. By game breaking I mean there are some incompatible items in the game which cause you to have infinite health or can help you to get every item in the game. There is actually a massive part of the community that has dedicated itself to finding game breaking glitches that can make them extremely overpowered; some of these people have broken the game to the extent that a single attack on any boss will kill them instantly.\n\nControls and Gameplay\n\nThe controls to The Binding of Isaac are basic. WASD to move and your arrow keys to direct your attack. You move around the basement from room to room, each room containing something different. There are normal rooms which contain enemies, gold rooms which contain power up items that will impact your speed, damage, health and can sometimes impact you negatively.\nYou first meet Isaac and his mother in the loading screen for the game which describes their lives as being happy until she hears a voice from above. The voice of god tells her to kill Isaac and Isaac, hearing this, flees into the houses basement to get away from his homicidal mother which is when the games main menu loads.  The game is about Isaac making his way through the basement to eventually reach and kill the boss, Mom. As you make your way through the basement you will encounter multiple different types of enemies (foetuses, pinworms, embryos, flaming headless monsters and lots of bugs) which will all try to kill you.\n\nGraphics and Sound\n\nThe graphics for The Binding of Isaac were made to have a retro feel to them. They have options for the in game detail which affects the rooms you enter. High detail means there will be cobwebs and blood on the walls while low detail will give you none of that. The detail setting also affects the pixels in game so setting it to low will give you a very fuzzy effect while high makes it look HD in comparison.\nThe music in The Binding of Isaac is very varied. The music changes depending on the floor and room you are on/in. The music keeps you focused while playing and can help you to know what type of room or floor you are on.  The sounds in The Binding of Isaac are very eerie to say the least. The squishing noises when you kill monsters and the screaming from bosses I found to be very unsettling when I was playing and actually impacted on my performance when I was playing.\n\nReplayability and Multiplayer\n\nThe Binding of Isaac is literally the most replayable game I have ever played; this is because of how unforgiving the game and how interesting the storyline is. With over 341 items and 178 secrets in the game you must replay constantly to finish the game with everything unlocked.\nThere has never been a official multiplayer feature for The Binding of Isaac however the great community surrounding it has created a few multiplayer mods for people to use. This let you play 2 players with you and another person on the same keyboard and you can both move around and shoot and fight enemies. Although the multiplayer mod is good, I think it ruins the game as there is no balancing aspect to the mod meaning there is now2 players but the same amount of bosses and enemies.\n\nTo Conclude\n\nI found The Binding of Isaac to be a ridiculously good indie game. The complexity of the story line and the references to religion surprised me and definitely made me enjoy the game a lot more. At only £4.00 this game is definitely one I would pick up off the steam store, especially as it is now one of my most played games and it’s one of the cheapest I own, this game practically pays for itself in minutes. The games DLC is also worth getting as it doubles the amount of content that is already inside this jam packed game, it adds characters, items, floors, monsters and more difficult bosses.  So to give this game a rating I would have to give it a:\n•	Easy to learn controls ✓\n•	Gameplay ✓\n•	Graphics ✓\n•	Sound/Music ✓\n•	Replayable ✓\n•	Multiplayer  X\nRATED 5/6","March 29, 2014","true","188.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Needless to say a wiki is a godsend when it comes to items and bosses beause some of the effects of the items are barely noticable unless you pay intense attention.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cyaitri/recommended/113200/","cyaitri","Cyaitri","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cyaitri/","175 products in account","The Binding of Isaac Game Review\n\nThe binding of Isaac is a indie rogue-like platformer game about a child called Isaac and his crazy religious mother. It is a game filled with secrets and unlockable characters and items with 2 DLC packs. After playing The Binding of Isaac for a few hours I realised there was a reason so many people described the game as “Unforgiving” and “disturbing”, It’s because its filled with satanic references, blood and gore. Not only that but The Binding of Isaac is incredibly difficult, only after my first 10 tries was I able to kill mom once. My favourite thing about The Binding of Isaac would have to be the game breaking aspect. By game breaking I mean there are some incompatible items in the game which cause you to have infinite health or can help you to get every item in the game. There is actually a massive part of the community that has dedicated itself to finding game breaking glitches that can make them extremely overpowered; some of these people have broken the game to the extent that a single attack on any boss will kill them instantly.\n\nControls and Gameplay\n\nThe controls to The Binding of Isaac are basic. WASD to move and your arrow keys to direct your attack. You move around the basement from room to room, each room containing something different. There are normal rooms which contain enemies, gold rooms which contain power up items that will impact your speed, damage, health and can sometimes impact you negatively.\nYou first meet Isaac and his mother in the loading screen for the game which describes their lives as being happy until she hears a voice from above. The voice of god tells her to kill Isaac and Isaac, hearing this, flees into the houses basement to get away from his homicidal mother which is when the games main menu loads.  The game is about Isaac making his way through the basement to eventually reach and kill the boss, Mom. As you make your way through the basement you will encounter multiple different types of enemies (foetuses, pinworms, embryos, flaming headless monsters and lots of bugs) which will all try to kill you.\n\nGraphics and Sound\n\nThe graphics for The Binding of Isaac were made to have a retro feel to them. They have options for the in game detail which affects the rooms you enter. High detail means there will be cobwebs and blood on the walls while low detail will give you none of that. The detail setting also affects the pixels in game so setting it to low will give you a very fuzzy effect while high makes it look HD in comparison.\nThe music in The Binding of Isaac is very varied. The music changes depending on the floor and room you are on/in. The music keeps you focused while playing and can help you to know what type of room or floor you are on.  The sounds in The Binding of Isaac are very eerie to say the least. The squishing noises when you kill monsters and the screaming from bosses I found to be very unsettling when I was playing and actually impacted on my performance when I was playing.\n\nReplayability and Multiplayer\n\nThe Binding of Isaac is literally the most replayable game I have ever played; this is because of how unforgiving the game and how interesting the storyline is. With over 341 items and 178 secrets in the game you must replay constantly to finish the game with everything unlocked.\nThere has never been a official multiplayer feature for The Binding of Isaac however the great community surrounding it has created a few multiplayer mods for people to use. This let you play 2 players with you and another person on the same keyboard and you can both move around and shoot and fight enemies. Although the multiplayer mod is good, I think it ruins the game as there is no balancing aspect to the mod meaning there is now2 players but the same amount of bosses and enemies.\n\nTo Conclude\n\nI found The Binding of Isaac to be a ridiculously good indie game. The complexity of the story line and the references to religion surprised me and definitely made me enjoy the game a lot more. At only £4.00 this game is definitely one I would pick up off the steam store, especially as it is now one of my most played games and it’s one of the cheapest I own, this game practically pays for itself in minutes. The games DLC is also worth getting as it doubles the amount of content that is already inside this jam packed game, it adds characters, items, floors, monsters and more difficult bosses.  So to give this game a rating I would have to give it a:\n•	Easy to learn controls ✓\n•	Gameplay ✓\n•	Graphics ✓\n•	Sound/Music ✓\n•	Replayable ✓\n•	Multiplayer  X\nRATED 5/6","March 29, 2014","true","188.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

First let me explain the game. You play a character who shoots enemies in his basement with his tears. The levels consist of several interconnected rooms, through which you generally fight a group of gruesome bad guys (zombies, mutant spiders, etc.). You fight through enough of them to get keys or coins, which allow you to open up rooms with upgrades or to buy upgrades. Each floor has a boss fight, after which you'll drop down to the next floor, then repeat the process.\n\nNow let me talk about the difficulty. You will quickly find this game does not mess around. You start off with three hearts. Each hit takes away half a heart; six hits and you're dead. If you die, you go back to the beginning of the game (absolutely no saves). On top of that, you often face multiple enemies who can move faster than you and can shoot projectiles. You also have extremely little recovery time with each hit. You'll need to explore every room to hopefully find powerups or money so you can pay for a little bit of health. Don't expect to find much health throughout each stage, except after bosses. This is easily one of the most difficult games that I've actually still managed to have fun with. Yes, it is frustrating at times, but it never seems unfair. The game plays by a certain set of rules and will always abide by them. There's a certain amount of comfort in knowing that. The enemies on the other hand, they range from mildly annoying to downright evil. But you'll see that for yourself if you buy this game.\n\nThe game's aesthetic design is great, the music is great, and the story, while macabre, is pretty interesting. The control is very good and the game is consistent in its dark atmosphere that some would call over-the-top dark humor. The art and level design are, for the most part, pretty simple, but that's okay. The game comes off as cartoony, but I think that contributes to the over-the-top gothic feel. Artistically speaking, it kinds of runs in a similar vein as Salad Fingers.\n\nWhile the Binding of Isaac is repetitive, there's actually a lot of variety. The game mixes up the bosses, each room is randomly generated with random enemies and random items, and there are a TON of different powerups. While it should feel like you're going through the motions again and again, for some reason it doesn't. The story isn't anything deep, of course, and any semblance of an actual plot is non-existent. You play through a floor, then drop down to the next; wash, rinse, and repeat. It's very similar to Diablo in that fashion. Some people may like that and that's fine, but just know that that's what this game is. While this seemingly meaningless trek initially irked me, I've gotten used to it and now I see the game for what it is. It's not really trying to be something it's not, and as far as original arcade shooters go, this one is probably the best I've ever played. The no-save feature is necessary, I now feel, because it encourages retrying and retrying. It builds skill. The random nature of the game is definitely a plus because you never play through the game with the exact map and enemy placement twice. The game's large amount of variety ensures the game has high replay value.\n\nI've gone back and forth on my opinions with this game. Originally I had mixed feelings because some of the less conventional aspects didn't jibe with my personal preference. However, it is strangely addicting and fun. The difficulty spikes at the fifth floor and gets to (in my opinion) near-impossible levels without mastery. At the moment, the price point ($4.99 for the base game, $2.99 for the DLC) is very good. It's a fun time-waster, especially if you've got a dark sense of humor. Even though I'm not really a fan of arcade shooters, this one sucked me in, and I can't really explain it. As I said before, the art design, music, and controls are all very good, and while the game gets incredibly difficult, it always seems fair. Most importantly, The Binding of Isaac doesn't claim to be something it's not, so it's important to see it for what it is. I've gone back on my mixed feelings and now say that I do recommend this one if you have a dark sense of humor and/or enjoy difficult games.","July 5, 2014","true","15.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

He can pick up many items and use them to his advantage to contact Child Services to take him away from his abusive family. Once you contact CPS, your family decides to shoot you, and you die.

But after playing 3 hours of this brutal top down dungeon crawler I realized I may never write a review. With that being said, lets get right into it.\n\nThe Binding of Isaac is a top down dungeon crawler game based off of a story in the Bible. The story goes is that there is a a man named Abraham who is visted by God himself and is asked to sacrafice his son Isaac. This story is a lot like The Binding of Isaac (Discount the monsters and dungeons).\n\nRight off the bat you can see that The Binding of Isaac is not just some regular top down dungeon crawler game. It has amazing art combined with a dark depressing theme. Each and every enemy you encounter will shock you, you will have to remember these enemies, how they look like, and their attack patterns in order to advance further into the game. The items are goofy and loveable. Now lets do some pros and cons.\n\nPros:\n- Fantasic soundtrack that will always keep you pumped up for the next boss\n- Vague yet incapturing story\n- A large variety of enemies that will only get harder as you avance further into the game\n- Unlockable characters, somthing to always strive to\n- There are indeed multiple endings\n- Until you've seen all endings and unlocked all characters and collected all items, there is always replay value\n\nCons:\n- This game is impossibly difficult\n\nI know there is only one con but that con is no joke. This game is hard and unforgiving. It's fun at times but it really does suck when you die right before the "Mom Fight". It has a deep learning curve and there is no description on any item you get, which means in order to use it right you have to look it up on the wikia. If you intend on buying this game there is a few things to know.\n\n1) You are buying a game that is difficult, and there's no way of changing that.\n\n2)  If you plan on really going hard at this game, there is some reseach and memorizing involed.\n\n3) If you are religious in any way, you may find this game's content to be offensive.\n\nMy final thought on this game is that it's a well made indie cult classic. I enjoy this game enough to play it every once and a while but not crazy about it. As for the DLC and Rebirth, I do not plan on buying those anytime soon.\n\n8.5/10","August 3, 2015","true","3.5"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","3"

At first glance you will be questioning getting it but is one of the best indie games I have played. The game is a rouge like with hundreds of items to bump into on the way as you go through room after room, floor after floor killing and defeating bosses along the way. WIth 10 different endings that will increase the difficulty each time you beat one and with different alternate endings after increases the play time value giantly. The game does look very dark on the elements but is a great game with refrences to other games Edmund McMillen as made. I would rate this 10/10 with charcters, mulitple endings, hundred of items you will not find that you have done everything and with each room you go into random everytime you will enjoy your time with this game £4.99 well spent.

And even ending the game you keep playing because many different combinations, because you never have an equal race. Diversity is the wealth of this game. The fact of having a DLC also features, it is not a DLC any, is a DLC that adds several items, increased playing time, has a very good price, and hence boost the passion for the game. And do not forget the "rewards" of the game, the fact that you fail to pass the challenge, and after a while trying and trying, finally you can and that's where you animate to play the game more and more, yielding hours and more hours of play.\n\nNegative: A great game, more done in a platform that harmed no doubt the same.

As i played and started learning new things about the game (i am still learning in spite of my playtime) it has just became more and more enjoying because there are tons of monsters, items, achievements (most of the achievements unlock an item so it has a chance to drop when you unlock the achievement), and bosses in the game. When you die, you start from the begining, but it never bothered me because everything is completely random. Everytime you play, every single monster, every room, every boss, every item you get and even the alignment of rooms are different! The facts like there are 2 secret rooms every floor, or pills giving you random effects, or the devil and angel rooms makes the game even more exciting . Besides it is replayable-duh- when you finish the game for the first time it adds two more levels (floors) and more bosses to the game and when you finish the game like 11th time it unlocks 3 more levels (one of them is optional). The downside is, it sometimes really stimulates me to lose all those gear I collected because of a momentary mistake but I am really glad I bought the game. It is a ''must have'' in my opinion. If you haven't bought the game yet, I highly recommend you to buy it.","October 25, 2014","true","59.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","3"

Binding of Isaac is an adventure and a lot of relegious things including the title. The story gets better and makes more sensesince the beginning isnt enough. The story is about you (Isaac) and your mother just chillin until your mother thinks God is talking to her and tells her to get rid of everything in your life since they are sins of his life. So she obeyed 'God' and took everything in Isaac's life (including his cloths and your naked the whole game). 'God' now tells her to go KILL Isaac if she truly loves 'God' more than Isaac. Well guess what she literally grabbed a knife and attempted to barge in his room. Luckly, Isaac finds a basement door in his room and your adventure starts.\nAs you go through the basement, you encounter enemies which you kill them by SHOOTING YOUR OWN TEARS (total logic).\nYou also find items which most of them help you by increasing speed, length of tears and damage. and give you wings.\nThere are special rooms like stores, death chambers and challenge rooms this is how you get to those 3 rooms:\n\nStore: open it with a key or if theres a secret room beside it, just cheat and blow up the wall beside the store.\nDeath Chamber: a room with only spikes, if your stupid enough (joke) to go to the spike and attempt to kill yourself, you actually can make a chest appear.\nChallenge room: if you beat the room beside the challenge room without taking damage, you can get in.\n\nHealth in this game is hard to get since you start with 3 hearts and finding them wont be easy. Now let's see how long you can survive under your house besides being a 2-floor basement.\nI give this game 9 out of 10 due to the difficulity and the most shocking thing about the game is that theres 7 characters (all mentioned in the bible) and you gotta beat the entire game 32 TIMES IN TOTAL. So have fun i know you can do it (not).","June 25, 2014","true","50.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

There is a large number of items that also randomly generate each playthrough that you can use to aid in your adventure. As you play the game, you unlock secrets and additional items to use in future playthroughs.\n\nWith the Wrath of Lamb DLC, there are additional items, a new item type, floors (as opposed to levels), and bosses. The DLC also introduces challenges that limit (or otherwise challenge) you, which upon completion unlock new items for the main game. If you are considering buying The Binding of Isaac, I highly recommend also purchasing the Wrath of Lamb DLC.\n\nThis game is heavy on both skill and luck. You will die a lot when you start playing the game. It will take many, many attempts to defeat the first final boss for the first time. As you complete playthroughs and unlock secrets, you will gain skill and new items that may help you in future playthroughs.\n\nThe biggest issue with this game is that the framerate drops when a lot of tears (projectiles) or flashing enemies (flies), probably due to using the Flash engine. This is highly noticeable while playing the game, especially upon completing two certain bosses. It took me at least 10 in-game hours to get used to the wild framerate. Another issue is that the game may almost crash when it tries generating certain floors, which can be resolved by waiting for the program to respond even if the option to close the problem comes up.\n\nIf you are interested in trying out the game, it is fairly cheap normally ($4.99 + $2.99 DLC ( $6.60 bundle)). If you wait for it as a specific Steam Sale, the combined cost is aroudn $0.68, which is definitely worth the purchase.\n\nThat said, if you are interested in the game and would probably play this game a lot (tens and tens of hours), I would recommend purchasing The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth, which is a remake of the original game and DLC. A lot of new items, challenges, characters, enemies, and bosses are introduced. The art style is better (imo), the mechanics are better due to the change in game engine, and the game runs much more smoothly. The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth costs $14.99 normally. It is up to you on which you purchase if you want to.","March 14, 2015","true","130.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Regular price is 4.99; and at times you can get it for 2.49 and even sometimes at 1.25. Even at 4.99 the game is well worth it. Very simple and basic controls used for this game. The endless amount of upgrades/bosses randomly found within keep the player going.

This is essentially a mash between Zelda and a roguelike. It also has a lot of creepiness attached to it. It's also a ♥♥♥♥ of a lot of fun. You walk into rooms, cry at monsters until they die, take their things, cry at a big monster, die, reload, enjoy. It's simple but effective as hell, mainly because there's always something you haven't seen just yet and the tension when going into a new room is high.","October 5, 2011","true","48.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

It has a oldschool top down dungeon crawler like feel, very much to the dungeons of old school legend of zelda on the NES. The graphics are in 2-D, 16-bit , and the fact that the visuals looks like it was drawn by a 5th grade, brings a unique blend of cute,grotesque, perhaps morbid feel to the aesthetics of this humorus and twisted game. This game was devloped by the geniuses behind Super Meat boy. The gameplay is simple moving with AWSD and shooting tears with the arrow button and droping bombs. The random generated dungeons, powerups,and the hardcore difficulty are some of the mechanics that makes the game shine. The comvination of these mechanics of gameplay is also what can be its weakness to some people. There over 100 difrent items and powerups within the game and sometimes these can make or break your dungeon run. While playing this game you may have moments between "woot this is awsome" and "dman.. this sucks alil" when it comes to what you find, but dont let that slow you down it's uncommon for the later but it dose happen.  It's a hillarious, brutal and fun game to play.

It features permanant death, so you have to stay focused while playing. You must dodge monsters and destroy them with your tears, collecting randomly dropped items scattered around the randomly generated dungeons. I've made it to the final boss, but have yet to beat it, and likely will not because I am waiting for the remake of Binding of Isaac to come out before I spend more time playing it. You could easily compare this to Teleglitch, but that game is a lot less random in terms of the items you find and enemies you encounter (even the boss progression is somewhat random in Binding of Isaac).\n\nStill, if you like what you see in videos on Youtube, etc... you can't go wrong for the price, and I do recommend this version until the remake is available.","December 26, 2013","true","44.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Period.\n\nSince everything in the game is quite literally random (room layout, floor layout, power-ups, items, enemies, bosses etc.) it provides an immense level of replayability. I have put 270 hours into this game and have had to start from scratch due to a corrupted save and still I absolutely love it and play it nearly every day.\n\nI always love a high level of challenge and difficulty and The Binding of Isaac provides this in SPADES.\n\nAt $8 for the game and the DLC (which is essential, in my opinion) this game is a great value. Better yet, it is often on sale for a couple dollars and this makes it a MUST BUY if you also enjoy a challenging and highly replayable game.","March 5, 2014","true","297.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

How disturbing is a mother trying to kill her son who escaped to the basement, and can kill anything with his tears.\n\nExploring the basement, you come across all sorts of horrendous monsters, decapitated cats’ heads, piles of faeces lying around and of course, your mother’s pads...among many other disturbing things.\n\nHowever once you become desensitized, this little game is pretty good. Going through each level, finding power-ups (or power-downs) to help you with the increasingly difficult monsters, ultimately fighting a boss to proceed to the next level of the basement.\n\nThere is no continuity, so once you die, you start again from the beginning. Everything is randomly generated, so you will never have the same experience twice.\n\nIt’s a really fun and interesting game, with alot of little references to other games -  You might find a pixelated pickaxe as a power-up, which of course, is Notch's pickaxe. You might come across a monster that spews toxic green acid, just like the one from Left for Dead 2 - and the list goes on.\n\nFor the price you should certainly try this game out.\n\nMy rating - 8/10","November 26, 2013","true","6.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Even in adversity, a little of good luck can turn the tide of the battle, and making poor decisions is punishing.\n\nHowever, as you play, you'll develop new strategies, and find combinations and combinations of items that are going to help you survive the horrid world that is the basement.

Oh goodness, this game.\n\nThe basis for this game originates around a small story in the bible, where Abraham is told to kill his son, as an act of obedience; His son's name, of course is Isaac. Upon almost achieving this goal, an angel stops him, letting him know it was merely a test. It is known as one of the most controversial bits of the bible, so I assume that's what sparked the creator's desire to make this game.\n\nYour journey begins when your mother hears a voice from "god", asking a sacrifice of her son to prove her faith. Isaac hides by dropping into a newly found trapdoor and finds himself in the dangerous pit of the basement. There, he finds what could have been, and what probably will be.\n\nThis saddening and dark atmosphere is lightened by it's sadistic power-up lineup and cartoony artwork. Items you can grab will give you benefits and change how your character looks, often leading to some crude jokes. Terrifying bosses aren't always this game's goal, instead it lets the gameplay do the talking. Often you'll find yourself not properly equipped to face up a certain room or boss. It really drives the helplessness of Isaac home.\n\nYou can do multiple runs of this game, with each one never being a copy of one before. Sure, the same items have a chance of appearing, but it ultimately feels like it's own unique run. You may be doomed from the start, or destined for victory; It all depends on your skill and luck.\n\nThe Wrath of the Lamb DLC provides a whopping amount of content. It introduces a new item type, adds new mobs, new floors and bosses, the works. It's essentially a new game.\n\nThis game is worth the full $8 to experience it all. Try it out yourself, you won't be disappointed!\n\n9.3/10 (Buy it. Now.) - WolfHero","May 3, 2013","true","84.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

If that isn't unsettling enough, the game itself is inspired by the biblical story of the binding of Isaac, where a father (Abraham) is commanded by God to sacrifice his son, Isaac. (In this case, Isaac's mother hears God who commands her to kill him to purge him of all his sins, yikes).\n\nPlease, do not shy away from this game from all the religious undertones and various symbolisms scattered throughout it, because The Binding of Isaac is so much more than that.\n\nAfter playing it for 230 hours, I was finally able to 100% the game. Some players might take more time to achieve this and some less. And I can strongly say, this is a very well constructed and very addictive game that offers much replayability and challenges, especially for such a low price (DLC a must!).\n\nIt's a rogue-like ''zelda-esque'' game with randomly generated floors, rooms, items, enemy fights and bosses. It's the type of game that, indeed, has to do with luck but also skill. While everything is somehow random, by learning what items do and how to fully take advantage of all the tools and mechanics the game offers, you will eventually become comfortable adventuring floors with each playthrough.\n\nThe game will be frustrating and very hard, but when you finally get your first win, it's oh so satisfiying ^w^b and it can only get better from there hehehe...","July 14, 2014","true","230.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

Yep, damn straight that's what it is. While this game is awesome, there are a few things that I have issues with. Let's start with the good things, shall we? Okay, the art style is awesome! I love the cartoony yet dark feel this game has to it. While it is a game that is dead serious, it's pretty funny with all of it's power-ups (which there are a frigging ton of) and bosses. Oh and good GOD ALMIGHTY that soundtrack. The music is creepy and also very catchy. PLUS! Every dungeon/ basement or whatthe♥♥♥♥ ever is random EVERY TIME, making every playthrough different. The characters and story are cool and funny (and down-right terrifying sometimes) and the enemies are also creepy and sometimes cute-ish. Now, those 'bad things' I said earlier? They really don't matter; but here we go. First, it's a flash game; therefore, it runs like ♥♥♥♥ (for me. I have an awfull computer). The lag, yes, can really pull me from the game, but it's something I get used to. And finally is that a lot of the power-ups are kindda crappy. But all-in-all, it's a great game, and I can easily recomend everyone to it.     Final Score=8.75/10\n\nEdit: I got Windows 8.1 and somehow my game runs like 50% better.

Just a while ago, I purchased the game for $5 on Steam and started playing it. This game is extremely fun. There is no reason for anyone who likes games to not get this game. The game costs $5 and I've already played it longer than some $20-$40 games.\n\nSTORY:\nYou play as Isaac, a small child who has been thrown into the basement under his house after his mother supposedly heard a message from god telling her to sacrifice her son. You, as Isaac, must traverse the basement, going deeper and deeper in an effort to survive the horrors in the depths below.\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nThe game takes place from a Birds-eye viewpoint, and you control Isaac using WASD and his tear shots using the arrow keys or the mouse. His tears can shoot in 4 cardinal directions (NSEW) and are used as Isaacs primary attack. On your way, there are secret rooms to find coins, shops to purchase items, treasure rooms to get new abilities, boss rooms to fight bosses, devil rooms to give up some hearts for a rare and special item, and so forth. The game has enough variety to keep me coming back for more and trying to perfect my "run".\n\nGRAPHICS:\nThe game uses a sort-of cutesy vector graphics format, which works well in contrast of the dark undertones of the game. Elements and enemies that need to stand out do so, while things that aren't as important don't attract your eyes attention, something very important in games similar to The Binding of Isaac.\n\nBALANCE:\nThe Binding of Isaac is well balanced, but it is easier to talk about what is not balanced rather than talk about what is. Tears Upgrades tend to be rather useless, as they are outshadowed in usefullness by their bigger brother "The Damage Upgrade", and the knockback produced from tears can go out of control with enough tears upgrades, sending enemies flying in all directions and making it harder to dodge. The game is also based on luck quite a bit, from the upgrades you draw to the rooms that you find, but it also requires a lot of skill, something you earn from playing the game. Additionally, some of the upgrades just plain suck. Other than that, the game is well balanced.\n\nOVERVIEW:\nThe Binding of Isaac is a Birds-Eye dungeon crawler with a fantastic concept and huge buckets of replayability.

If you are more rage-inclined, and you have a  short temper and want fast action, this is definately not the game for you (unless, of course, you WANT to get yourslef mad ;D)\nI will reward this game an 8/10, and I strongly suggest you try it, as without a steam sale it is under 10 bucks with all the DLC included (which I strongly recommend you purchase, it fixes and adds many, many things that improve the game immensely).","December 29, 2012","true","387.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The story is not really anything that matters for a game like this, but it is nice to know why Isaac is running around in a creappy basement, full of monsters.\n\nThe controles are simple, you can move in any direction, and you can shot in four directions, up, down, left and right. Along the way you will find upgrades, that can make you shot in other directions, shot faster, do more damage, gain more life, get friends to shot together with you and many more items.\n\nThe funny part about the items, is that they don`t tell you, what the item can do. You either have to look at your stats, or try to shot, in order to see what the item did for you. If nothing changes, it can get really diffecult to find out what the item did, and you have to remember what meny items did, so you don`t end up downgrading youself.\n\nThere are also tarot cards, that do diffrent things like clearing rooms, make enemyes take damage, teleport ypu and many more things.\n\nThere are diffrent roomes on the map, that do diffrent things.\n\nThe plain rooms, are just a figting room, you have to kill all the enemeyes in a room, in order to countinue to a nother room.\n\nThere is a sacrifice room, where you have to take damage, in order to get an item.\n\nThere is the a shop, where you can buy items for coins, this can be health, weapons, tarot cards, nearly everything.\n\nThen there is a secret room, where you have to bomb away a wall, in order to get in. If you don`t have a map that shows you where this room is, you have to bomb random walls.\n\nThere is an arcade, where you can gamble, with your money and win prices.\n\nThen there is a tressure room, where you unlock the door with a key, in order to get an item.\n\nAnd then there is the boss rooms, and this is where the real action happens. To advance in the game, you have to defeat a boss, and the bosses are random selected, based on whitch floor you are on. The bosses can be hard, and some can be easy, but I would say they all are very injoable.\n\nSo about the diffeculty, it is not only due to hard mobs and bosses, but also becouse it is a rough like game, if you die, you die, no countinues. This can get you very frusterated at times, but it is also the charm of a rough like game. You will end up dying a lot, and if you don`t have the right items, or haven`t found anything speceail, the game will punish you for that.\n\nThe game has fantastic music! I love evety single track, and I promiss you will too! The music are very atmosferic, and they are good to psyck you up.\n\nThis is one of my favorite games, it is fun, addicting and overall a fantastc game, thumps up. 8 out of 10","November 8, 2014","true","65.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

There is a large number of items that also randomly generate each playthrough that you can use to aid in your adventure. As you play the game, you unlock secrets and additional items to use in future playthroughs.\n\nWith the Wrath of Lamb DLC, there are additional items, a new item type, floors (as opposed to levels), and bosses. The DLC also introduces challenges that limit (or otherwise challenge) you, which upon completion unlock new items for the main game. If you are considering buying The Binding of Isaac, I highly recommend also purchasing the Wrath of Lamb DLC.\n\nThis game is heavy on both skill and luck. You will die a lot when you start playing the game. It will take many, many attempts to defeat the first final boss for the first time. As you complete playthroughs and unlock secrets, you will gain skill and new items that may help you in future playthroughs.\n\nThe biggest issue with this game is that the framerate drops when a lot of tears (projectiles) or flashing enemies (flies), probably due to using the Flash engine. This is highly noticeable while playing the game, especially upon completing two certain bosses. It took me at least 10 in-game hours to get used to the wild framerate. Another issue is that the game may almost crash when it tries generating certain floors, which can be resolved by waiting for the program to respond even if the option to close the problem comes up.\n\nIf you are interested in trying out the game, it is fairly cheap normally ($4.99 + $2.99 DLC ( $6.60 bundle)). If you wait for it as a specific Steam Sale, the combined cost is aroudn $0.68, which is definitely worth the purchase.\n\nThat said, if you are interested in the game and would probably play this game a lot (tens and tens of hours), I would recommend purchasing The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth, which is a remake of the original game and DLC. A lot of new items, challenges, characters, enemies, and bosses are introduced. The art style is better (imo), the mechanics are better due to the change in game engine, and the game runs much more smoothly. The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth costs $14.99 normally. It is up to you on which you purchase if you want to.","March 14, 2015","true","130.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It presents a unique stoyline, focusing around Isaac, a small boy who it is presumed wishes for his mother's affection. As the game has a heavy religion focus, a god speaks to his mother with the order to end Isaac's life. Isaac, fearful of his mother finds a hidden trapdoor in his room, and delves into the depths of what is under the house. The game itself is mainly skill based, but partially luck based. Certain combinations of items can ensure an easy and victorious playthrough while other item comboes make a challenging and tedious one.  It contains endless tilesets aswell as a total of 11 different settings along with 7 characters. This game is insanely fun, and provides a testament to your dodging skills. There are many more positive things I can say about this game, but I advise you pick it up and find out yourself ;)","June 26, 2014","true","113.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Yeah.\n\nThis has got to be one of the sickest, most disgusting, horrifying, frustrating yet amazingly addicting games I have ever played. Once I found myself in the Basement, I found I couldn't escape, in more ways than one.\n\nThis game is HARD. Like, balls-to-the-walls hard. Hell, it took me a few attempts just to get to the second floor. And then it took me more attempts to get two more floors or so. And so on and so forth. The game is frustrating to the point not of breaking you, but making you want to keep going. You'll die, and I'll think "GAH! I ALMOST had it! ...Just ONE more try, I can do it!"\n\nOf course, just trying again isn't a guarantee of further progession or victory. The floors you play in are randomly generated each time you start a game, so the experience will never be exactly the same twice. That's part of the fun of this game - just seeing what's in store for you every time you give it another go.\n\nIn these randomly generated floors I've been randomly rambling about, you may find many things: enemies to hurt you, items to help or hurt you, shops, secret rooms found by blowing up walls, secret rooms hidden in secret rooms, and some TWISTED boss fights. Seriously, the bosses of this game are some prime examples of this game's nightmare-inducing imagery. Most of them are also pretty fun to fight, or at the least, satisfying to beat. ("YES! IT'S GONE! I DON'T HAVE TO LOOK AT IT ANYMORE!") Really, there's just WAY too much content to go over. For such a seemingly small 2D package, The Binding of Isaac sure does have a crap-ton of content and replayability about it.\n\nAnd for all of that, it's fun as hell. With the super-low price tag of five dollars and an extra three for a crap-ton more content, The Binding of Isaac and Wrath of the Lamb are MUST BUYS. If you somehow haven't bought them already, do yourself a favor and do so. Right now. Yes, now.\n\nWith all that said, ladies and mentlegen, I bid you adieu.\n~Tyranno","November 25, 2013","true","25.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

The first time I played Isaac I remember being frustrated and felt that I wasted two dollars. I never bothered to play beyond the basement. It's difficult for me to pinpoint what initially put me off from Isaac, but I chalk up my ignorance to an inability to progress. I didn't enjoy losing and quickly concluded the game was simply not for me.\n\nA couple years later one I was introduced to a livestreamer named LethalFrag. He often loaded up Binding of Isaac; one of his favorite games. While playing he often spoke highly of Isaac's replayability, soundtrack, and addictive gameplay. His praise helped me realize that Isaac deserved another look; and now I couldn't agree more with his assessment.\n\nTo appreciate The Binding of Isaac I needed to make some progress and unlock items. Dying stopped being so horrible as I faced each challenge and overcame them step by step. I understood that it was perfectly acceptable to lose; that's just part of the process. The trick was to pick myself up and learn from my mistakes. From there I was able to immerse myself in the gameplay.\n\nI've now logged over one hundred hours into the original Binding of Isaac and Wrath of the Lamb. I still find myself coming back for more. With the release of Rebirth I play the original far less often, but the newest "Eternals" update has got me back for what I expect will be another 100+ hours.\n\nTL;DR: The Binding of Isaac is unquestionably the best investment I've ever made on Steam. There's still plenty to appreciate, though Rebirth is now a much smoother experience.","April 18, 2015","true","139.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hylianargonian/recommended/113200/","hylianargonian","SurrealSaxhleel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hylianargonian/","89 products in account","NOTE: Please buy the 'Wrath of the Lamb' DLC if you're going to get this. It will make TBoI a million times better, and will allow you to update the game to get the Hard Mode.\n\nWith randomly generated dungeons for every playthrough and a top down dungeon crawling experience in the same vein of the original Zelda trilogy, The Binding of Isaac is a roguelike game that can be picked up for less than a dollar and provides hours and hours of fun on end.\n\nFollowing Isaac, a young boy who is trying to defeat his murderous mother after almost getting killed by her, TBoI has hundreds of items, ranging from the cutest of fashion accessories to the most grotesque parasites and diseases. With a randomisation system that makes no two playthroughs the same, TBoI is an adventure, a big step forward in the world of indie gaming, and ultimately, you'll have a hell of a time playing it.\n\nMy criticisms with the game are that it's impossible to predict what items you're going to get, and while this adds to the mystery, this also means you can become obscenely OP or obscenely UP and it can become frustrating having to play through with what could be called a dead weight on your leg, which combined with the VERY steep learning curve, makes for a frustrating time with some playthroughs.\n\nNonetheless, with a game that you can pick up for less than one dollar, where can you go wrong? I highly reccommend TBoI, and if you like it, go pick up the remake, The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth!","May 5, 2015","true","29.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It presents a unique stoyline, focusing around Isaac, a small boy who it is presumed wishes for his mother's affection. As the game has a heavy religion focus, a god speaks to his mother with the order to end Isaac's life. Isaac, fearful of his mother finds a hidden trapdoor in his room, and delves into the depths of what is under the house. The game itself is mainly skill based, but partially luck based. Certain combinations of items can ensure an easy and victorious playthrough while other item comboes make a challenging and tedious one.  It contains endless tilesets aswell as a total of 11 different settings along with 7 characters. This game is insanely fun, and provides a testament to your dodging skills. There are many more positive things I can say about this game, but I advise you pick it up and find out yourself ;)","June 26, 2014","true","113.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It sort of reminds me of Out There Somewhere and Realm of the Mad God.\n\nThe Binding of Isaac is a dark game. And I mean DARK. The story your led to believe is that Isaac's mother was told by God himself that Isaac was corrupted, and needed to be killed. This sacrifice would prove Isaac's mother's loyalty to him. But, before she gets the chance, Isaac escapes to the basement. The game is very simple: WASD to move, arrow keys to fire your tears, and E or Left Shift to place bombs. That's about all of the controls. The game is completely random, so no two playthroughs will be the same. Also, if you die, you have to restart the ENTIRE game over. So, my advice, just stay alive, and don't die.\n\nOverall, this is a very fun, and unique, and dark game. If you NOT like dark games, then you will not like this. Otherwise, I recommend this game to everyone. Also, if you are a Christian, then you may not like this game.

That doesn't bother me, but the game is definitly not appropriate for a younger audience and those who don't take religion jokes lightly.  Also, some of the bosses/mobs are a bit gruesome and distrubing (but I dont mind!!).\n\nThe game without the DLC has about 7 levels, takes me about an hour (on a good run) to beat the game. Considering that I have more than 20 hours into this game and have only beaten it 5 times :C. The trick to this game is that death is permanent for your current playthrough. Once you die you have to restart at the beginning and pray for good items.\n\nIF you aren't accustomed to the perma-death scenario I don't reccommend this game.

I keep returning to it when I have a minute and I don't feel like doing anything complex or time consuming. Would absolutely skip if it wasn't on sale. Still very recommended at a reasonable price if you're looking for a simple casual game which is easy to get into.\n\n\ntoo long part:\nSTORY - ?/10\nYou're playing as Isaac - a little kid whose mom is nuts and wants to kill him, so he descends through a trap door in his room to fight his way through creepy places with creepy monsters in them.\n\n\nGAMEPLAY - 6/10\n- Simple but hard to master controls. Depends on anyones taste.\n\n- The game has its own economy and a SH*TLOAD of upgrades, active skills and consumables to be discovered. Each upgrade and skill is very interesting and fun to mess around with. While it's tempting to google what does what, it's way better fun to just pick something up and see what it does.\n\n- Levels are randomized and there is a lot of various monsters and bosses to spice things up. You won't play the game the same way twice. From this point of view the game offers infinite replayability, but...\n\n- The fact that everything is so heavily randomized prevents you from forming any sort of your own strategy. You just dive in and keep going until you win or die. Over time, this reduces the cool variety to the point where you're doing the same thing over and over again and it's only a liiiiiiiittle bit different because of some dice roll.\n\n- There is not much persistence to keep you returning for more. There are few unlockable characters and mandatory achievements but upgrades and skills are limited for each run where you find them. While it's nice to know that the game doesn't have you on a leash trying to unlock everything, it doesn't really motivate you to achieve anything when you start from zero every single time.","November 17, 2014","true","18.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

Yeah.\n\nThis has got to be one of the sickest, most disgusting, horrifying, frustrating yet amazingly addicting games I have ever played. Once I found myself in the Basement, I found I couldn't escape, in more ways than one.\n\nThis game is HARD. Like, balls-to-the-walls hard. Hell, it took me a few attempts just to get to the second floor. And then it took me more attempts to get two more floors or so. And so on and so forth. The game is frustrating to the point not of breaking you, but making you want to keep going. You'll die, and I'll think "GAH! I ALMOST had it! ...Just ONE more try, I can do it!"\n\nOf course, just trying again isn't a guarantee of further progession or victory. The floors you play in are randomly generated each time you start a game, so the experience will never be exactly the same twice. That's part of the fun of this game - just seeing what's in store for you every time you give it another go.\n\nIn these randomly generated floors I've been randomly rambling about, you may find many things: enemies to hurt you, items to help or hurt you, shops, secret rooms found by blowing up walls, secret rooms hidden in secret rooms, and some TWISTED boss fights. Seriously, the bosses of this game are some prime examples of this game's nightmare-inducing imagery. Most of them are also pretty fun to fight, or at the least, satisfying to beat. ("YES! IT'S GONE! I DON'T HAVE TO LOOK AT IT ANYMORE!") Really, there's just WAY too much content to go over. For such a seemingly small 2D package, The Binding of Isaac sure does have a crap-ton of content and replayability about it.\n\nAnd for all of that, it's fun as hell. With the super-low price tag of five dollars and an extra three for a crap-ton more content, The Binding of Isaac and Wrath of the Lamb are MUST BUYS. If you somehow haven't bought them already, do yourself a favor and do so. Right now.

I will breakdown the components of the game:\n\nStory - 9/10\n\nThe Binding of Isaac's storyline is based off the eponymous Bible story. Isaac (a kid) and his mother live in a small home situated on a hill, both peacefully keeping to themselves, with Isaac drawing doodles and playing with his toys while his mother watches Christian broadcasts on the television. Isaac's mother then hears "a voice from above", stating her son is corrupted and must be helped. It asks her to remove all sin from Isaac to save him. She obliges, and takes away his toys, games and even clothes.\n\nThe voice again calls out to Isaac's mother, stating Isaac must be isolated from all the evil in the world. Once again, she follows its command and locks Isaac in his room. Finally, the voice speaks to her again, and tells her that she has done good, but it still questions her faith and commands she must sacrifice Isaac. She obliges, grabbing a kitchen knife and goes to Isaac's room. Isaac is watching through a sizable crack in his door and starts to panic. He finds a trapdoor under the rug, and just as his mother bursts in, he opens the trapdoor and jumps down it. Isaac then puts the paper he was drawing onto his wall, which transitions into the game's title screen.\n\nThe game has multiple endings, all pointing at different ideas about Isaac's life.\n\nGameplay - 10/10\n\nThe ingame dungeons are procedurally generated, allowing endless hours of entertainment. It also includes random bosses from a list of over 20, 100+ powerups and items, and 50+ different types of enemies.\n\nSound - 8/10\n\nTBOI has a great soundtrack and amazing background music which is highly attractive and creates a great atmosphere in this bizarre game.\n\nOverall - 9/10\n\nFYI: I have played a lot more of this game than said by Steam as I have played the DRM free version.","November 27, 2015","true","12.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The game's mechanics and presentation is similar to the dungeons of The Legend of Zelda, while incorporating random, procedurally-generated levels. Every room you enter, you must clear it if you wanna get outta there or put a bomb in front of the door that will do it too. Each floor of the dungeon includes a boss which you must defeat before continuing to the next level. Oh yeah, they have item rooms too. You can unlock new characters if you can get some achievements. This game has a lotta religious refences, oh wait, not only refences this games is about the Christianity. We can say that I suppose. So, this is the best roguelike, dungeon crawler game I've ever played. I can't wait for The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth. I'm ready for it! Buy this game and prepare yourself for Rebirth!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CeeLoGreed/recommended/113200/","CeeLoGreed","The Papa","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CeeLoGreed/","223 products in account","After playing Super meat boy, I started looking out for new games by the same developer. Edmund Mcmillen’s wonderfully strange imagination is an interesting thing to explore through his games, that’s for sure.\n\nThis game was not a disappointment. At first, I had no idea what to expect, the trailer was very strange but a tad intriguing. When I came across it there was next to no information about the game and the mechanics of it on the store page and back then there was no costumer reviews to go off of. Admittedly I never actually brought it to give it a go off of the information I was given, I ended up with it from a bundle and it’s the only reason I really played it. Although I wish I had taken the leap to try it because it is well worth it.\n\nBinding of Isaac is a randomly generated dungeon crawler, one I have heard to be described as Zelda-like you’re a young boy running from his demented mother. Who has been blinded by her hard-core Christianity and believes that the voice of god has spoken to her and told her to murder her son to prove her loyalty. So a very interesting concept, indeed.\n\nA short cut scene plays on start-up, which expands on what I just described, you find yourself wandering through randomly generated dungeon floors, fighting monsters, picking up loot and items as you go along that changes how you fight, gives you different abilities and drastically changes Isaac’s image. At the end of each floor, you fight a boss, and move on down to the next floor. It being harder than before, with a bigger space to explore and more enemies to defeat.\n\nThere’s a large range of items to collect that when found for the first time is added to the “things I found” section in the main menu, so a lovely bit of collecting there to entice those OCD minded like myself, There’s new characters to unlock which vary in stats, challenges to complete and even some DLC that can extend your gameplay.\n\nYou are given one life and one life only. You can find hearts to heal, but once you are dead, that’s it, you start all over again. So throughout the whole game and especially when nearing the end, it starts to put a little pressure on and gets that heart rate going. I’m not one to be good under pressure so it gets me every time. I FINALLY managed to complete the game a few times over, again, admittedly, only after I gained some “top tips” from my way-to-good-at-games brother. There have been people that have completed the game 10 times over and still not gotten bored. I think that the randomly generated dungeon element to it keeps its replay ability intact. If it were to replay the same levels over and over when you died, the game would be a lot different and no doubt a lot less popular.\n\nI have heard from friends that it is quite hard to complete without “doing your research” on the wiki or seeking tips from those nerdy minded like my brother who managed to figure all of it out themselves. I on the other hand find that kind of thing enjoyable, because it beats you every time and you work and research and try to understand the game more to finally get to that ending. I can quite honestly say that the first time I reached the end, my heart has never beaten that loud or that fast in a long time. And that sense of accomplishment you get from finishing a game, is a on a much higher scale when you work to complete this one.\n\nThe music is great, it fits the setting perfectly and is great to listen to. Rarely have I actually wanted to download a game’s soundtrack, I can give most soundtracks a thumbs up but not often do I actually want to listen to game music outside of gaming.\nThe art, as per usual in Edmunds games, is amazing. And I hear they are also looking to remake the game to have a more “retro” look, with possible multiplayer features. Which should be very interesting. For those interested you can look up “Binding of Isaac: Rebirth”.\n\nAll in all, it is a great indie game, which is both fun and challenging. Definitely worth trying, I am not usually the dungeon crawler type, but this game is a lot of fun. The only fault that I had with this game, which has bothered me quite a few times now, is that I have lost my save for no reason. The game is listed as having ‘Steam Cloud’ features, but it definitely doesn't work. I haven't uninstalled the game, I haven't touched it. But recently I hopped on and seen all the progress that I had made was gone. And for a game that has no real save points or ongoing plot to keep up with, your stats, unlocked characters and collection of things you have found is pretty much all you have. I was pretty upset to see it had vanished and it’s something I felt I needed to warn people about.\n\n\nTL;DR : Awesome music, fun and engaging game with a slightly 'twisted' side to it. It's a challenge to reach the end and you can definitely end up putting a lot of hours into this. Addictive and awesome all around.","March 28, 2013","true","144.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It sort of reminds me of Out There Somewhere and Realm of the Mad God.\n\nThe Binding of Isaac is a dark game. And I mean DARK. The story your led to believe is that Isaac's mother was told by God himself that Isaac was corrupted, and needed to be killed. This sacrifice would prove Isaac's mother's loyalty to him. But, before she gets the chance, Isaac escapes to the basement. The game is very simple: WASD to move, arrow keys to fire your tears, and E or Left Shift to place bombs. That's about all of the controls. The game is completely random, so no two playthroughs will be the same. Also, if you die, you have to restart the ENTIRE game over. So, my advice, just stay alive, and don't die.\n\nOverall, this is a very fun, and unique, and dark game. If you NOT like dark games, then you will not like this. Otherwise, I recommend this game to everyone. Also, if you are a Christian, then you may not like this game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/EdgeEdgeEdge/recommended/113200/","EdgeEdgeEdge","Edge","http://steamcommunity.com/id/EdgeEdgeEdge/","247 products in account","The Binding of Isaac is a two-dimensional Action-adventure Roguelike game, which preforms amazingly well in it's Genre. I will breakdown the components of the game:\n\nStory - 9/10\n\nThe Binding of Isaac's storyline is based off the eponymous Bible story. Isaac (a kid) and his mother live in a small home situated on a hill, both peacefully keeping to themselves, with Isaac drawing doodles and playing with his toys while his mother watches Christian broadcasts on the television. Isaac's mother then hears "a voice from above", stating her son is corrupted and must be helped. It asks her to remove all sin from Isaac to save him. She obliges, and takes away his toys, games and even clothes.\n\nThe voice again calls out to Isaac's mother, stating Isaac must be isolated from all the evil in the world. Once again, she follows its command and locks Isaac in his room. Finally, the voice speaks to her again, and tells her that she has done good, but it still questions her faith and commands she must sacrifice Isaac. She obliges, grabbing a kitchen knife and goes to Isaac's room. Isaac is watching through a sizable crack in his door and starts to panic. He finds a trapdoor under the rug, and just as his mother bursts in, he opens the trapdoor and jumps down it. Isaac then puts the paper he was drawing onto his wall, which transitions into the game's title screen.\n\nThe game has multiple endings, all pointing at different ideas about Isaac's life.\n\nGameplay - 10/10\n\nThe ingame dungeons are procedurally generated, allowing endless hours of entertainment. It also includes random bosses from a list of over 20, 100+ powerups and items, and 50+ different types of enemies.\n\nSound - 8/10\n\nTBOI has a great soundtrack and amazing background music which is highly attractive and creates a great atmosphere in this bizarre game.\n\nOverall - 9/10\n\nFYI: I have played a lot more of this game than said by Steam as I have played the DRM free version.","November 27, 2015","true","12.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The diagnostic criteria require that symptoms become apparent before a child is three years old.[2] Autism affects information processing in the brain by altering how nerve cells and their synapses connect and organize; how this occurs is not well understood.[3] It is one of three recognized disorders in the autism spectrum (ASDs), the other two being Asperger syndrome, which lacks delays in cognitive development and language, and pervasive developmental disorder, not otherwise specified (commonly abbreviated as PDD-NOS), which is diagnosed when the full set of criteria for autism or Asperger syndrome are not met.[4]\n\nAutism has a strong genetic basis, although the genetics of autism are complex and it is unclear whether ASD is explained more by rare mutations, or by rare combinations of common genetic variants.[5] In rare cases, autism is strongly associated with agents that cause birth defects.[6] Controversies surround other proposed environmental causes, such as heavy metals, pesticides or childhood vaccines;[7] the vaccine hypotheses are biologically implausible and lack convincing scientific evidence.[8] The prevalence of autism is about 1–2 per 1,000 people worldwide, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) report 20 per 1,000 children in the United States are diagnosed with ASD as of 2012 (up from 11 per 1,000 in 2008).[7][9][10] The number of people diagnosed with autism has been increasing dramatically since the 1980s, partly due to changes in diagnostic practice and government-subsidized financial incentives for named diagnoses;[10] the question of whether actual prevalence has increased is unresolved.[11]\n\nParents usually notice signs in the first two years of their child's life.[12] The signs usually develop gradually, but some autistic children first develop more normally and then regress.[13] Early behavioral, cognitive, or speech interventions can help autistic children gain self-care, social, and communication skills.[12] Although there is no known cure,[12] there have been reported cases of children who recovered.[14] Not many children with autism live independently after reaching adulthood, though some become successful.[15] An autistic culture has developed, with some individuals seeking a cure and others believing autism should be accepted as a difference and not treated as a disorder.[16]\n","August 19, 2013","true","72.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"
