I've been following this game series ever since the original 'Soldiers Heroes of WW2'. When I tried the demo back then, and realized that you can take the shells out of your broken tank to load a stolen anti-tank gun, and you can scavenge the fallen bodies for weapons and ammunition, and you can take cover behind virtually everything, and you can drive tanks through buldings, I was immediately sold.\n\nThis amazing level of detail and authenticity is still present today, and it brings an immense level of control and different tactics that you can use. That comes at the expense of very much micromanagement and almost every key on the keyboard being assigned to some action. That makes it hard for newcomers to pick up, but once you memorized everything, you're going to have a blast.\n\nThe multiplayer component is a bit shaky, because it uses an old GameSpy service. That's why I have very high hopes for the upcoming Assault Squad 2, which promises to have full Steam MP integration. The developers have been listening to the community a lot and have published several free updates with lots of new content, so I trust them on this one.","December 6, 2013","true","177.3"," 125 of 138 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","125","138","0","5"

Time for a bit of fast micro..  Upon reaching the area the enemy was last spotted there is no sign of them, they have likely scattered into various cover (all units in a squad can be indivudually controlled in fine detail or directly controlled) ..

I command my soldier to only return fire preventing him from opening fire and giving away his location, I tell him to get down on the ground and crawl to a nearby bush. I know my empty half track presents an irristable target for the enemy to steal... the bait and trap set,  I switch my attention to re-enforcing my front lines, perhaps a sniper to spot and an AT-gun patch up the line, cant afford more infantry yet, I spread my lines a little thinner.\nI spot the red dots in my backline on my mini map, lucky I caught it!

I mow down enemy infantry spotted until I've run out of bullets.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DangerousSaiga/recommended/64000/","DangerousSaiga","Dangerous Saiga","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DangerousSaiga/","221 products in account","Men of War: Assault Squad is a real time tactical/strategy game that takes place in all fronts in World War II. The game is different from other World War II strategy games that relies on direct control (having the ability to actually control a unit), tank realism, and individual micromanagement. The game requires a strong ability of militaristic tactics such as flaking, taking cover, support, and other attributes. Assault Squad is a terrific strategy game in its own merits, but a few flaws might make you consider to get this game or not.\n\nOne of the most greatest parts in the game is the importance of tanks. I reallly mean it. Obviously, tanks can shoot infantry and blow up things. In Assault Squad, tanks is, without a doubt, the main essential to victory. Nearly the majority of "skirmishes" requires the player to push and capture 10 control points. It is possible to take 10 control points with only infantry and support classes, but it will be very, very difficult to substain the enemy AI's counterattacks with medium and heavy tanks that will crush your forces. Tank damages is top notch and highly realistic. Assault Squad can be explained in one sentence: Infantry is the soul of your forces, but tanks is the body to move your forces to win. Another positive attribute is its immersion. The environment looks good for a 2011 game. It's not the best looking game in today's standards, but it does look pretty neat to look at. Most strategy games have a limit cap on how many units you can have, but Assault Squad does not have such cap. It's not unlimited, but you can have a lot of units under your command. Lastly, the direct control mode is really helpful when your squad cannot take out a certain position. It'll relieve you some stress in dire situations and turn these situations into your advantage.\n\nThere are some flaws in Assault Squad. One of the major problems is the AI, the enemy and your forces. The enemy AI is not stupid, but it can be very frustrating and, occasionally, exploitive. The problem is that the AI would send in two medium and one heavy tanks and 20+ infantry every two minutes as reinforcement. Sure, it does not sound that bad, but Assault Squad requires the player to be "aggressive". You can take a capture point, one at a time, and just hold your position until the enemy stops (or slows) their counterattack against you before you can start taking another control point. However, this will only increase stress. The enemy AI is really, I mean really, smart on targeting the weak spots on your tanks. Prepare to get upset when the enemy destroys most of your tanks in one or two shots. In the other hand, your tanks is not very smart. They tend to show its sides to the enemy, saying: "Hey enemy, shoot me in the back. I'm open". Basically, the tank AI is not very smart.\n\nAnother flaw in Assault Squad is punishing difficulty. There are four difficulty modes: Easy, Normal, Hard, and Heroic. The problem is that Normal Mode is not normal at all. Normal mode is really difficult for moderate players who have a decent amount of playing other RTS or standard strategy games. Hard mode requires very aggressive gameplay mechanics, but Heroic is the impossible. Literally impossible. The difficult gap is very wide and the enemy AI enjoys throwing very tough enemy units to rout your forces and probably requires you to conduct unorthodox methods to win. Assault Squad has no mission varieties besides of capturing 10 control points missions and standard defense missions (then control 3 enemy positions). Basically, no mission varieties. Unfortunately, the multiplayer in this game is dead because of GameSpy ceaes to exist so I wasn't able to play multiplayer to get the experience.\n\nThe flaws in the game sounds very discouraging, but it's not a turn off. Assault Squad is a fine tactical strategy game and relies on strategic thinking and tactical methods. Men of War is not your standard strategy game and will appeal to certain audience within the strategy game community. Do I recommend this game to other strategy players? Yes, if you only play single player since multiplayer died. If you are looking for multiplayer, then you can get the sequel, Men Of War: Assault Squad 2 instead. It is best to only get the game when it is on -75% off, nothing else since the community in the first Assault Squad barely exist.","April 11, 2015","true","43.4"," 53 of 54 people (98%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","98","53","54","4","0"

People mention 3rd party programs you can use for matchmaking after the shut down. That is not practical as those 3rd party programs won't be as safe. The issue has been brought up, why not just use Steamworks for MP? That's a very valid question, the reality of the situation is, the company that makes this, is lazy, and would rather force everyone to buy their new game. Truly unfortunate because Assault Squad 1 is one of my favourite strategy games of all time, heck, even one of my most favourite games of all time. To see a company do this when they had the chance to show they support their community and their games, is truly unfortunate. Who is to say they won't do the same thing to AS2 in a few months?\n\n**4/8/14 Update to Review**\n\nRecently announced, Men of War: Assault Squad, will not be playable in multiplayer after May 31st 2014, the game creator is ending it's steam support for MOWAS, aswell as the earlier versions of the series. Their explination seems to stem from "We're unable to provide support, but, you can purchase Men of War: Assault Squad 2, and it will be fine" , that in itself seems fishy, but overall I leave people's interpretation of that move up to them. The game review still stands, tis a great and fun game, but all in all, the company's descision to end multiplayer essentially kills the game unless you're willing to risk using a 3rd party software for MP. Telling your customers to simply "Purchase the new game" instead of continuing support of your recent products, is an unfortaunte situation for everyone that enjoys MOWAS1 , so buyers beware. If the company comes out with a new game in a year that's based on the Men of War series, you could be looking at this happening again. I personally am retiring from the Men of War series over this move. Very, VERY toxic business move.\n\nA very, very in depth RTS that is more historically accurate and well put together than games of the same Genre (IE Company of autists) , You will not be dissappointed if you're looking for a quality, well made RTS based around WW2 with a few extra easter eggs thrown in. (Christmas mission to defend against the grinch, ect.) Not for those new to RTS's but it does have a tutorial that will show you the ropes. Multiplayer can be a challenge as there are several instances of a little lag, and others not speaking english, other than that, MP offers 1 on 1 up to 8 on 8 matches where you can lay down some serious hurt. Squads can be broken up into 1 man detachments or anything in beetween, different level of infantry can mean the difference beetween conscripts equipped with pea shooters to elite troops with body armor and assault rifles and are fully trained. Vehicles and artillery can range from a simple machine gun or jeep, to a 60 ton late war tank or heavy artillery, how you field your army is up to you , use them wisely!","November 25, 2013","true","172.3"," 65 of 82 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","65","82","0","6"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/antwog/recommended/64000/","antwog","Antwog","http://steamcommunity.com/id/antwog/","192 products in account","Men of War: Assault Squad is a World War II strategy game developed by Digitalmindsoft and published by 1C Company and was released in February 2011. You, the player, play as different countries from WW2 in historically accurate battles and complete this battles by capturing a set number of strategic points on the battlefield. I will write this review from a single-player perspective by only playing skirmishes, as I did not play this game online or with friends. It will discuss skirmishes, the gameplay within these skirmishes, the graphics and performance, and the overall recommendation.\n\nThe main feature of Assault Squad is an underwhelming skirmish mode. A skirmish is a play through recount of a historical battle that is chronological, therefore, there is no proper story campaign. However, there is a recount of the story in the loading screen prior to battle. The skirmishes are split into six categories of America, Germany, Japan, Soviet Union, Britain, and bonus missions, so there is a nice balance of skirmishes. The skirmishes are decent at best, but there is laziness in the mode. The objectives are identical in each mission and country skirmish, which is unfortunate because there is variety in the side missions that add to the skirmish tasks. I did not finish all skirmishes because the lack of variety does not add an incentive for me to complete them, hurting the overall playability of the game. But, I do like the accuracy of the history and the realistic environments within the campaign because the environment adapts as the battle rages on. For instance, if an artillery shell hits the ground it creates a nice and massive hole to showcase the damage. Overall, the skirmishes are a let-down due to the lack of variety.\n\nThe gameplay is solid. I commend the developer for making small things count to add to the realistic nature of the game. For instance, a soldier can die in one hit. Furthermore, the gameplay has a very nice strategic concept as a vehicle out powers infantry, though the infantry can flank and destroy the vehicle. The game strikes a good balance between automation and micromanaging, as your soldiers run out of ammo so you have to go to dead bodies and collect ammo, which evenly distributes that ammo among the entire squad. This balance allows the game not to be bogged down by the micromanagement concept, as the battle is real-time and you can easily lose units. Assault Squad has limitations through the type of available units. For instance, each country has unique units, accurate with the historical counterparts, but there is not a wide variety of different units for the player to choose. While this does not overly hurt the game, it could have been expanded upon.\n\nAssault Squad compensates for an underwhelming skirmish mode by having strong graphics and optimised performance. The graphics capture the tone of WW2 through the environment, such as the smoke that arises after a vehicle has been destroyed. Further, the graphics are beautiful when showcasing buildings and the realism of them. Likewise, the performance is great as I run consistently at a 60FPS on ultra-settings.\n\nMen of War: Assault Squad is an overall average game. The skirmish mode is underwhelming mainly due to the lack of variety in objectives. The gameplay is solid in that it is very realistic, which it should be for a WW2 game. The graphics and performances are very good. There were not any notable issues, but the game did not wow me nor did I think the game was good. The lack of incentive to continue playing the game hurt my playability of it. However, there is enough content for others to play this for a long time. I played this game for 15 hours but there is enough content to play through to 30 hours, and with friends at least 60 hours of fun. I played the original Men of War and I liked that, but I felt this was a downgrade. I recommend this game on sale.\n\nSkirmishes: 4/10\nGameplay: 5.5/10\nGraphics and performance: 8/10\nReplayability: 7/10\nOverall: 6/10\n\nThanks for reading my review!

Probably because I never gave it a real shot.\nIt can't be compared to Company of Heroes and shouldn't be.\n\nThe game has a very realisitic damage table which means that an infantary dies just after 1-3 hits.\nFacing a tank can be a deadly outcome which can whipe a squad within seconds.\nI strongly recommend that you start off by playing the easy campaign to learn the basic and still be able to enjoy the game.\n\n+ Realistic damage\n+ Slower, tatical warfare\n+ Real WW2 weapons and vehicles.\n+ Control units (WASD+Mouse) or run, walk, phrone, suppressing fire etc.\n\n- The missions are quite fun but they don't give you many units to play around with. The Germans doesn't have air support (famous stuka?) or any of their famous arty guns.\n- Missions are too similar. No big change in layout\n- AI are really buggy and stupid. You tell a vehicle to drive from A to B and it get stuck half way.\n- The resupply system could have done automatic. I'm talking about  letting a soilder go back and forth to resupply an artiliitery for e.g. This is something you need to do manually and having 2-3 arty's takes time to do. I don't mind that it takes time but you leave the whole battlefield open because you are busy to resupply guns.\n- Multiplayer could have been so much better developed.\n\nOverall I think this game lack of hungry developers. It seems lke they are happy about how the game runs or not runs.\nIMO if they actually spent money and time to come up with a new fresh multiplayer, fix the AI's. a better hotkey system (QWERTY) this game can easily be a top strat game.\nAt current state 7/10 because it cost less then a dollar.","March 5","true","14.2"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","89","16","18","3","3"

I totally recommend this game! This is one of the greatest WW2 RTS's on Steam! Men of War: Assault Squad is really hard and this adds a level of action and excitement. It adds fine control of your squads to the unit. You can directly control them where it's kinda like a shooter of some sort, or you can control them like traditional RTS. You can also manage their inventories. Did your tank blow up? No problem, just don't forget to take the MG! I recommend this game over any other WW2 game even Call of Duty: World At War or Company of Heroes.\n\nWhat I especially love in this game are the tanks! Who doesn't love tanks! The tanks in this game are so amazing! Tanks don't just blow up if the health reachs 0; there are multiple ways to disable a tank. Driving a tank gives you really false confidence because in the open, it is vulnerable to attack either by AT guns or bigger and better tanks.  One time, one of my tanks got stuck on a bridge and just tumbled off and ruined the engine. It was a bit annoying yet cool at the same time.\n\nEvery unit in the game has a role and the combination of these units really helps your battalion/company/whatever. For instance, you can have a sniper supress the enemy while you move your infantry forward to attack. It's never that simple though!\n\nThis game is really worth the money, get the second if you wish! I haven't tried the second but I will after I finish the Skirmish mode (Campaign).","April 6, 2015","true","20.4"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","10","12","0","0"

Men of War: Assault Squad is considered a sequel to the previous game Men of War.\n\nMen of War: Assault Squad retain the same element of gameplay from Men of War, which is micromanagement. But unlike the first Men of War, Men of War: Assault Squad offers a skirmish based mission rather than a story based campaign. This skirmish game is a capture the flag type game which you need to capture all the enemy flag position to win the game. New units and weapons has been added, and for the first time in Men of War series, Japanese faction has been fully added to the game with voice acting, vehicles and weapons of their own. The game also comes with an editor in which you can make your own skirmish based mission or make your new story based mission.\n\nGraphics of Men of War: Assault Squad has been improved. Explosion effects, sounds, weapons tracer, even the vehicles and weapons model are all improved. As the game being patched, new weapons and new vehicles are being added to the game. The game still runs pretty smooth with all these upgraded graphics. And Men of War series is the only game where you can hear an American soldier saying "for the Motherland".\n\nThe multiplayer were a good part of the game, there are many game modes to choose from capture the flag, frontline attack and defense even the skirmish cooperative mode. But all of the multiplayer feature has been disabled since GameSpy has been shutdown.\n\nMen of War: Assault Squad is yet to be the best of Men of War series. Many features and addition makes the game more rich with content to play with in the editor. I recommend this.\n\nRating 8/10","December 12, 2013","true","24.6"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","12","16","0","1"

Certain features such as taking control of tanks (and other military vehicles) and setting up ambush points while controlling the tanks main gun, this is often the best way of countering the enemy vehicles. Each of the 5 nations have their own combat styles. Germany for example, often has the best vehicles with the veteran tiger tank being a most formidable single unit along with a goliath 'drone' (ww2 RC XD, for you cod players out there). The japanese army however, does not have particularly brilliant armoured vehicles but more than makes up for it with the sheer number of men, light tanks and rocket artillery. With the replay value, this game has loads. Each time you play on a different difficulty, you instantly notice the difference with the amount of men and armoured vehicles that arrive throughout each battle. On the medium difficulty when playing against the German army, Panzer 4 tanks make up some of the stronger tanks. Moving on to the hard difficulty, half way through the battle Tiger tanks show their faces along with Panther tanks later on, making sure you know you're in for a tough time. This game however does not have what you might call a story, more in line with encounter battles, which is a down side to this game.\nThose people that play world of tanks may like this very much as the tank combat is very strong in this game and in men of war 2.\nIn my view, this game has to be a 9.5/10 rating and better than company of heroes!","May 19","true","217.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","4","4","2","0"

Troops will acquire experience and their equipment will follow from one battle to the next (unless You choose to reset their invetories).\n\nMy recomendations for a german side starting 1940 - bring Your 88 guns ASAP and capture as many Bren Carriers as You can. You can store a lot of equipment in those carriers. This will let You keep micromanagement to the minimum as "reset all inventories" will not reset captured vehicles yet You will not be forced to micromanage every soldier and every gun as they will have their munitions in each battle. There is no way to resuplay Your own tanks in the mod, for example, unless You reset their inventories.  And those carriers are superb for towing Your 88 flak guns around the battlefield - they have rather low profile and will let flak guns to fire over the carrier and they will provide a good MG cover against attacking infantry.\n\nI hope the creators of this awesome mod will continue with Assault Squad 2 and add more features in the future also.","April 19, 2014","true","181.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","2"

Taking direct control of units, the vehicle damage model, all makes this a very special game.\n\nHowever, voice acting in the campaign is... unbearable and the campaign in itself is not impressive. This game is clearly made for multiplayer.\n\nThough, the sheer amounts of mods that exist and are being created fixes most of these. Probably half my gameplay is of playing mods. I'd suggest Moddb for finding these.\n\nShould you buy this game? I would say yes, but if you can wait then i should wait till assault squad 2, which seems to improve a lot of problems.

Had massive fun destroying them in 1v1/2v2/3v3/4v4 matches (each one seems like a completely different experience) as well as being destroyed by them and teaming up with them to fight against AI and progress through the map whilst getting rewards along the way.\n\nLooking forward to pick up Men of War: Assault Squad 2 as well as Call to Arms at some point too!\n\nOnly downsides are that there is no obvious 'Free for All' type which means you need to have an even number of players for it to be a fair game (each player gets 100CP to spend on units, meaning the larger team always has an extra 100 to spend) as well as the fact that the system that was used for multiplayer having been shut down (the only ways to play multiplayer are throuh programs such as Hamachi, Gameranger, Tunngle or by just using LAN if you're on the same network).\n\nI would reccomend getting this game definitely, but if you have the money to spare then Men of War: Assault Squad 2 or even Call to Arms (although it's early access) may be a better option due to more features as well as a more expansive multiplayer system which will also allow you to fight with/against random players and not just your friends or people you know.\n\nPerformance is a little iffy in terms of seemingly having fps that is dependant on how many units are on the field no matter what your PC's specs are (many units = lag, especially tanks or other vehicles)\n\nIf I had to rate it out of 10 I would give it an 8/10, it's a great game but has a few flaws which are seemingly solved in the sequel.\n\nThere are few games that I've had as much fun playing with friends than this.","November 5, 2015","true","50.9"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

The MoW brand of military RTS is absolutely amazing... the emphasis is definitely on realism... with actual penetration and armor values, unit inventory, destructable environs, and limited resources.  The day I realized that I could loot a dead enemy's body for weapons, health kits, and rounds made me a believer.\n\nAs such, MoW:AS is basically the same gameplay, with the exception that there is no "campaign" with a scripted overarching story.  Missions are skirmishes against the computer AI (some with limited scripting) and multiplayer human vs. human on a number of maps and using several different game modes.  Initial resources are granted as "points" which can be spent to buy units.  Additional points slowly trickle in... as capture points are seized additional advanced units become available for purchase.  Reinforcements appear at the bottom of the map and advance to the point you designate.\n\nI have played the skirmish modes for a number of hours now on easy, which is still challenging.  There are many factions... german, american, british, japanese... some good map variety and about 20-25 skirmish missions will keep you busy for about 30 hours.  The more advanced maps are very challenging and usually involve multiple phases.\n\nI only have a few complaints about this game:\n> It should be easier to re-supply troops with ammo from fallen enemy soldiers, or the resupply truck.  Automating that task would be a huge improvement.\n> Some maps feel repetitive... a few more scripts to add variety would be welcome\n\nRelatively minor annoyances honestly.  If you are a WWII RTS fan, then get this game immediately.  Even better, start with the original MoW and play the rest of them first.  You will learn all the commands and gameplay tricks.  If you are a Company of Heroes fan, give this a try for a much more interersting challenge.\n\n8/10","June 5, 2014","true","77.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Fall0utGuy/recommended/64000/","Fall0utGuy","Alex ☭","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Fall0utGuy/","192 products in account","I really like this game! It has graphics, destructive environments, and direct control, allowing you to take control of the IS-2 you just ordered in to the battlefield and destroy that enemy Panzer IV in a beautiful explosion while the building next to it crumbles down over it and it's supporting infantry.\n\nObjective variation is not good, not good at all. All the missions are: Take the battlefield... Also, some, or most maps end with the enemy throwing next to endless waves of tanks and infantry at your face... No "Blow that tank up" or "Destroy that building" objectives or anything like that. Not even secondary objectives! But if you have a good imagination you can issue yourself your own goals to follow. It's not neccesary, but it could keep you interested for a little longer. Of course not something like "Take that heavily defended Flak 88 within one minute" But i think you know what i mean.\n\nHowever, with all the nations: United Kingdom, USA, Germany, Japan, and Russia there are definately enough nation specific weapons and troops to keep you occupied for some time. Also, the variations from map to map and one the map are also quite good, for example the Overlord mission in the USA campain where you have to first, push up through a small village and then through open countryside, or the jungle in the first or second Japanese mission i don't remember the name of...\n\nAnd there's also a couple of mods i know that are worth trying out, like the "Unlimited popcap" for multiplayer, or Sirhinkels Skirmish maps for single play, or Cooperation. For something harder, that's more 'Trial and faliure' you could try the Carentan mod, which just adds one campaign, with one map. There's different ways to go to complete it though.","March 3, 2014","true","133.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/packersfan/recommended/64000/","packersfan","Peggy Hill","http://steamcommunity.com/id/packersfan/","291 products in account","TL:DR, If you enjoy realistic games, and you enjoy RTS games, this is great even if you pay full price\n\nFirst off, if you played earlier men of wars and found the to be overly difficult and annoying, this fixes problems. I remember playing MoW Vietnam. The final kill counts were like me 600 kills, them 6. This game is NOT like that. They allow for a lot more renforcements which creates bigger and better battles.\n\nIf you have never played, Imagine Company of Heroes but way more realistic. Every unit has an inventory which can be scavanged and depleted. If you have a tank in battle for a prolonged ammount of time you may find your self out of HE, AP, or the covited APCR(I will expand on ammo types and options in the next section). Machine guns can run black, and so can snipers. Every one is prone to running completely black on ammo. The cool thing is you can always scavange, many times in my American play I found myself picking up and MP40 when I felt like it may be more effective for the close range fighting that was happening. All weapons and all ammo drops when units die, and can be picked up, unless the unit is blown up. The game also allows you to buy a supply truck completely loaded with 1000s of rounds of ammo.\n\nAlso each unit has many options as to weapons they can use, unlike CoH, you can actually have unit switch to a side arm, or switch to grenade, you have so much more control of each man on the field. Where this become most evident it with the armor, This game has some of the best tank physics I have ever seen, when you shoot something with an AP round, you can actually see the hole if it punctures, as well as it hits every on in its path just like a real AP round. It does not just blow up the tank, it blows a hole through it. That is if you actually get a clean hit with a big enough cannon. This is the best part of this game, tank on tank battles. I had a single Stuart take on anything the Jap army could send, That same tank was completly worthless against the germans. Super realistic and fun, and allows for complete control.\nMy last point and best part about this game, is the direct control. If you just hit E on any unit it gives you complete control. You aim the weapon, fire it, and move with the WASD. Where as normally in an RTS you just right click to attack, in this you can move and attack, with the most possible control, especially with tanks. Moving into postion with a sherman and hitting a Panzer IV point blank with a 76mm APCR Is one of the coolest things you can do.\n\nFrom a game play standpoint, I got the whole thing on sale, with all the DLC. Which comes with 5 mission for each of the Russian, German, American, Japanese, and Common Wealth factions. Play slow and enjoying it took me 8 hours to beat the USA campagn. So a lot of paytime there. TONS of units!!\n\nGreat fun, Cheap game, do it!\n\n","December 4, 2014","true","26.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The game itself is certainly a fun one; gets the brain working for strategy, and is rather realistic on its approach to a WWII RTS. To me it's like if Red Orchestra was turned into an RTS.\n\nThe only thing that kills this game (and not the fault of the game or the devs) is the community. It's fairly difficult to find a friendly random to play with. If you don't have high levels, you will certainly get kicked from a few games before finally finding one, and some of the high-level players are completely dishonorable by choosing to fight weaker new players rather than those of their own callibre. There is also no random matchmaking, so you HAVE to find an accepting server if you want to play (and multiplayer is the core of this game)\n\nBasically, great game, but I would suggest encouraging a personal friend to also get the game, or gift a copy to him or her as well. This game is REALLY fun if you got fun people to play with.","May 11, 2014","true","37.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The detail of combat is amazing, and reminds me a bit of my old Gamecube game, Battalion Wars, where you can take control of the most modest infantryman, or that badass battlestation (or in this game, the Tiger tank) and go to town with it.\nIt's the first game I've seen in awhile that accuratly show how vulnerable tanks actually were. In most games, they're these killing machines that somehow take multiple shells, but here, with this game's tank armor system, almost anything can knock out a tank without actually destroying it, such a mine taking out a tread to render it immobile, or a well-placed shot that snaps the barrel of the main gun, or of course just blowing the living ♥♥♥♥ out of it.\nThis game also has a fully destructable map, where you can knock down a small wall, an apartment building, or even put ♥♥♥♥ing holes in the ground from motar and artillery shells.\nIt alas doesn't well represent the mortality of man, where they are able to somehow take an 8,8cm Tiger shell straight to the face.\nBut all-in-all, this is a very fine game and it's a great pick for a dual WWII/RTS intrest.\n\n---German Soldiers Mod Review---\nI really love this mod, it adds even more realism (like the mortality of man) and is generally just really freaking awesome.

If you like RTS or RTT, games like World in Conflict or Command and Conquer this is a good game to get. The game has amazing vehical and infantry combat, awesome graphics and a massive varity of units, vehicals, and weapons. The game is pretty realstic and has a lot of depth to it. Yeah, the voice acting is a little "meh" but it doesn't take away from the amazing experiance the game offers. You can double or even triple your amount of fun with mods for example, the Fields of Honor, Star Gate, World War 1, and Cold War mods. If you like real time strategy or real time tatics games this is good choice. If your like World War 2 strategy games this is a good choice. If you are bored of all your current strategy games and are looking for a new one, this is a good game to try out.\n\n\n*EDIT* MOST IMPORTANT NOTE: Recently Men of War Assault Squad 1's multiplayer has been shut down due to Gamespy closeing. Instead of switiching providers like other games did (for example Arma 2) the owner of the Men of War franchise decided to only switch Men of War Assault Squad 2's multiplayer provider. Thus, forceing fans to buy Men of War Assault Squad 2, which is a horrible game. So the only way to play multiplayer on Men of War Assault Squad 1 now is to use Gameranger. It is still a great game but without knowing how to use gameranger and haveing some friends, it looses what makes it so unique. And, since Men of War Assault Squad 2 is litteraly, a piece of crap cranked to keep up with Company of Heroes, Men of War's rival. All in all, MOWAS 1 is a solid good game but has no multiplayer.","March 5, 2014","true","480.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","2"

I'm still trying to play it.\nThe game feels nice at first, but after a while you see all the bugs and lack of common sense among your soldiers that you want to throw your computer through the window.\nYour soldiers did a good fight, but end up without ammo, what do you do?\nMicromanage your units to refill their ammo!\nI know, realism... But in realistic game you would just put an ammo truck nearby your squad, so they can refill their ammo, and your units would do it!\nThe amount of problems with pathfinding among your soldiers is so huge, it really ruins the experience with this game.\nYou want to move your mortar unit?\nGah! They can't move through there!\nYou got a brand new and shiny m8 greyhound straight from factory!\nBam! It is stuck on the streetlamp! Points wasted cause enemy comes and destroys it!\nMicromanagement would not be that bad in this game if your soldiers had some common sense so you could leave them alone for some time.\nI remember, that in original MoW soldiers weren't too bright, but you were in the control of smaller squads, so could pay them your full attention.\nWhat is nice in this game?\nJapanese campaign!","May 29","false","2.8"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","5","9","0","0"

However, each soldier has an idividual inventory, requires ammo, has weapon proficiency levels that affect accuracy, can lose his rifle from shock, etc. Every little detail of war is thought of, such as scavenging dead bodies for ammo and a new helmet. Also, there is tons of mods available for this game that add plenty of new units and options. Another great touch is this game includes a built in editor that allows you to build custom maps and battles.

The sheer amount of detail is staggering: Fully destructable environments and morphing landscape, fully realised unit inventories (guns, ammo, grenades, sandbags, explosives, knives, bandages; it's all there and freely tradeable between your soldiers), smart unit AI, direct control over any unit in the field, the best RTS cover system (brick walls actually stop bullets, as opposed to providing a 'defensive bonus') and realistic ballistics and damage models. Starcraft 2 looks like babbies first RTS by comparison.\n\nWhile good micro is still important, good macro, field awareness and tactical thinking play a more prominant role. Did Colonal T. Awesome get sniped while gunning down Fritz with his 50. cal? Then get Private S. Meatshield to go grab that machinegun, and do his mother proud.

All ballistics are modelled physically. There is no life bar on tanks instead it depends of physics and penetration, any parts that are damaged will result different effect.\n\nA lot of different tactics to try out.\n\nEnvironments are very detailed and battlefield changes dynamically, building can be destoryed, wreckage block tank's path and create new cover etc. No two game played out the same way.\n\nFor me it's a pro, there's a lot of micro management down to the manually manage ammunition of each individual soldier and gas up vehicles manually. Some player might not like this though.\n---\nCon:\n\nGraphics are functional, but nothing to write home about. Audio gets repetitive after a while, all units repeat the same lines to acknownlege your commands.\n\nThe game is very unforgiving, be prepared to save an reload a lot. Even the best tank can be one-shot killed if you are not careful. Sometime feels like a puzzle game where you are carefully removing enemies' defence one piece at a time. At the writing of this review only 8.4% of players completed the first mission on normal difficulty, so don't be shy to start out in easy difficulty.\n\nNo stories to speak of, just go from south part of the map to the north that's about it. If you want story you should try other MOW titles.\n\nThe game model the ballistic of every bullets, so you need a good CPU, instead of GPUs like other games.

Do not get discouraged at first by it´s complexity and micromanagement intensive oriented gameplay. Once you grasp the basics and learn to play the game on, at the least, mediocre level, you will thoroughly enjoy it. I recommend you play it with a friend or somebody who can guide you through the initial stage. You wil get sweared upon for being a "noob", you will get kicked, thrashed and sometimes utterly crushed. The only way to overcome this is by learning the game and outplaying your opponents.\n\nMost of the community is rather unfriendly towards newcomers, therefore you should stick together with a friend. Even though and older release, you can get a game going fairly easily.\n\nIf you are a casual gamer who prefers simple click-and-drag games and linear FPS shooters, stay away ! If you are a hardcore RTS fan who likes the challenge do not hesitate and buy this game at once. You will love it.","January 2, 2014","true","687.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The allure, to me, is that they went in a different direction with the typical WWII genre. You have games like Company of Heroes where they play as an RTS. This game takes what COH does well, and expounds upon it. There isn't much of a story, not that you really need one, I mean, it is based in WWII and you fight in major battles. The style is very much like any other RTS, except that it doesn't have base building, and you can directly control each unit. This, combined with beautiful level design, realistic weapons/stats/damage, and intuitive game play, and you get a very well put together game.\n\nWith that ut of the way, I do have a couple of critisisms that irked me the whole way through. First and foremost, This game only offers 3 missions per nation. That's right, 3 mission. More can be purchased through Steam, but it is disappointing to see that this game isn't very long when it comes to single player. It also bummed me out that it lacks any kind of match making verus AI, like COH, or any other RTS. I don't know if that was a technical limitation, or what, but it makes the game developers look lazy, which is a shame, because this game is so well put together. Something else you will find out is how hard this game is. You need to be slow and thoughtful in your approach to each objective, because enemies can out flank, or over power you if you aren't careful. This isn't nessecarily a bad thing, as it shows how well done the AI is in this game.\n\nAnd I forgot to mention how bad the narrator is. He has the same voice for all of the nations. It is laughable.\n\nLook, if you are like me, you buy games when they are on sale. This isn't a game you should pass off, but I wouldn't recommend buying it at full price. It is a load of fun, even though that fun is short-lived. And despite some replayability issues, it offers a multiplayer experience that will keep you in deep thought. Consider buying it if you enjoy a challenging, yet realistic experience.","February 24, 2014","true","107.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Also, there is tons of mods available for this game that add plenty of new units and options. Another great touch is this game includes a built in editor that allows you to build custom maps and battles.

Your unit AI will need micromanaging down to the ammo they need to shoot guns. They are too stupid to pick up ammo from bodies automatically. If someone runs out of ammo they stand still and wait to die. Pathfinding is completly broken. For example: A squad needs to get into a trench, instead of jumping into the trench from the side they are closest to, they will run all the way around to the far end of the trench will there is a proper ramp, usually resulting in the entire squad getting gunned down. Medics need your guidance to heal thier mates. They will wait next to someone bleeding out, unless you take the time to select the medic and click on the downed guy the medic will not heal him. Tank movement needs constant micromanagement as well. If you want a tank to back up, it will decide on its own to do a 180 and expose it's ♥♥♥ to enemy fire.\n\nThere is no story mode, the single player "skirmishes" are based on battles from history and (all the achevements are from singleplayer btw) are very cookie cutter, you start with one unit and take objective capture points one by one to unlock more tanks that can be called in as reinforcements.  Every skirmish mission is like this. Skirmish difficulty scales way to high very quickly. Your tanks often get oneshotted by seemingly inferior enemy tanks. Advancing with your tank is suicide as enemy AT guns are impossible to take out before your tanks are one shotted. Your AT guns? Usually goes like this:\nMISS\nMISS\nBOUNCE\nMISS\nGLANCING HIT\nIf you decide to play this game kep the asprin close. And stretch your thumb and index finger for the ineviatble ALT-F4","February 21","false","39.6"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","46","6","13","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jhaxavier/recommended/64000/","jhaxavier","Haxavier","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jhaxavier/","312 products in account","This is a different kind of strategy game. There's no silly basebuilding, resource gathering, or other superflous stuff. You get your points, you buy your units, and you tear your opponents apart for the objectives. Making up for this lack of BS is an incredibly detailed unit and gameplay system. Armor combat is realistically modeled in this game, with penetration value, sloped armor, angles, and location-specific damage taken into account. Oh, and did I mention you can directly control any unit in this game, allowing you to pull off those daring tactics that the AI sometimes just isn't realiable enough for?\n\nThat aside, this is essentially similar to Men of War, but missing a substantial SP component. Its multiplayer is a very refined, distilled version of MoW's great multiplayer, and is very well balanced overall. If you don't mind the realism or intense micro, this is a game worth checking out, at least.","April 20, 2011","true","424.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Men of War: Assault Squads has this potential and already surpasses CoHO in a variety of ways. Even if you're still tooling around with vanilla CoH or any of the expansions and are tired of the hack monsters when attempting to engage in a simple multiplayer match, never fear, the developers seem to have those concerns in mind as well.\n\nCheck out Youtube or elsewhere for some player made videos and see for yourself. If you're not a stranger to the MoW series, then think of this title as the polished and enhanced version of Men of War: everything you've been waiting for under one roof, so to speak. So, if you're a fan of WW2 RTS games, you won't be disappointed in the release of this well supported game. :-)","March 6, 2011","true","104.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

That has changed a lot now.\nThe gameplay itself is lots of fun for me, but I am hating the game as a whole more every time I play. (keep in mind that I just play solo, with some rare co-op)\n\nAI is terrible. Infantry will take the dumbest routes to get to a location, and all the time i will lose armor because it decided to stare at a single enemy off to the side instead of watching the road that tanks were coming down.\n\nBalance is broken. Enemy armor and field guns seem to have much higher accuracy than mine. Also holy ♥♥♥♥ is it hard to kill things like enemy StuGs, but they can take mine out in one or two shots.\nAnd trying to get through Commonwealth missions is like trying to kick yourself in the head. Sure you can do it if you really try, but it's just going to hurt. They lack any usable anti-tank infantry and even their high cost vehicles can hardly take out the StuGs that they mainly go up against.","October 3, 2015","false","56.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Lets you play as Germans, Americans, Soviet Union, Japan and Commonwealth (Brits). Has a pretty long campaign(skirmish) which gets repetitive, but is ok. Gives you an overall view of how each nation works. Since Gamespy is down, no multiplayer for you! You have to use tunngle or gamerager(doesn't work for me). Multiplayer is great! Multiple gamemodes: Skirmish(coop), Assault zones, Frontline(one defends, other attacks),  Day of Victory(DLC) and Combat. Main resource is MP, which you gain over time. You can order in troops from infantry to nebelwerfers. Physics are great! Ricochets, destroyable enviorment, guns, helmets, everything works like an entity and will fly away if something explodes nearby. You can direct control every troop in your arsenal. You can move camera into any position. Practically play world of tanks. Most fun thing is TNT. Set off a charge(timed) and don't run away. Let your troop stay there and when it explodes, your man will fly off. He won't die though. Just needs a little sleep. Great game! 10/10 Comparing to company of heroes 2, it loads VERY FAST and DOESN'T CRASH EVERY ♥♥♥♥♥♥  MIN LIKE THAT SON OF A BIICH COH 2!!! Buy it if it's on sale!","February 9, 2015","true","61.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

That has changed a lot now.\nThe gameplay itself is lots of fun for me, but I am hating the game as a whole more every time I play. (keep in mind that I just play solo, with some rare co-op)\n\nAI is terrible. Infantry will take the dumbest routes to get to a location, and all the time i will lose armor because it decided to stare at a single enemy off to the side instead of watching the road that tanks were coming down.\n\nBalance is broken. Enemy armor and field guns seem to have much higher accuracy than mine. Also holy ♥♥♥♥ is it hard to kill things like enemy StuGs, but they can take mine out in one or two shots.\nAnd trying to get through Commonwealth missions is like trying to kick yourself in the head. Sure you can do it if you really try, but it's just going to hurt. They lack any usable anti-tank infantry and even their high cost vehicles can hardly take out the StuGs that they mainly go up against.","October 3, 2015","false","56.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I thought I was going to love this game, but I really don't. Everybody in all of the other reviews say how hard it is, and they're right. It's insanely difficult, but for stupid reasons. Whenever you tell your men to get into cover, they might do it and they might not. Whenever you tell your men to move from cover to cover while you're under fire, they will stop halfway, stand right out in the open, and get slaughtered, every single time, no matter how many times you tell them to keep moving. An entire squad of men will die in an instant, because they didn't do what you told them to do. This could be all my fault, because there are so many buttons to use that they had to resort to combinations of buttons to do even more things. Trying to remember what all the buttons do, is like trying to learn a new language. If I were going to learn a new language, it would be whatever language this game was programed in, so I could add a new button. I would call it, just do what i say, and when I push it, my men would have to do what I say. I've only played this game for a few hours, and I don't even know how many times I lost, because my men wouldn't do what I told them to do. I can't even begin to explain how frustrating that is. I honestly had to go smoke, because I was getting so mad. I can see how a lot of people really like this game, and ten bucks is a good price for it, but Company of Heroes is also ten bucks, and it's so much better. SO MUCH BETTER. I recommend that instead.\n\nSUMMARY-You will lose, many, many times, simply because your men won't listen to you. It honestly felt like I was telling a kid to do their chores. It's just a losing battle.","March 12, 2015","false","4.2"," 16 of 34 people (47%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","47","16","34","6","1"

I don't mind a game with a good multiplayer but in this case this should be marketed as a multiplayer only game since the "campaign" is boring and tedious to get through and is not a campaign at all but a series of capture the victory point missions. In singleplayer, every faction has basicly the same exact units with different names, you have to capture victory points and win then go to another map that looks the exact same and repeat the process in a series of completely unrelated missions. I personally prefer every other men of war game to this one because they have a good singleplayer campaign.","January 6, 2015","false","5.9"," 13 of 28 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","13","28","0","0"

The singleplayer skirmishes are dull and arent that challenging after you have completed a couple of missions. Its repetative and you feel like you are playing against a very old and slow computer. The computer doesnt punish you enough to make it challenging. You certainly cant play just the singleplayer on this game. The greatest part of the game is the multiplayer, but since that has been taken out of the game it has turned the game to trash. I cannot explain how much they destroyed the game by closing down the servers once MoW AS 2 came out.\n\nDont get me wrong, I did enjoy playing this game a lot with mates. It is a laugh and can be some epic battles. I would absolutely reccomend this game if you have a bunch of friends that you see regularly. If you dont have mates that would come around to play, dont worry about getting it as it needs multiplayer to be enjoyable.\n\nIf you absolutletly wanted a game like this then buy MoW AS 2 because this one just isnt enjoyable for long periods of time like it used to be.","January 3, 2015","false","31.6"," 2 of 10 people (20%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","20","2","10","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Spades_Neil/recommended/64000/","Spades_Neil","Spades","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Spades_Neil/","152 products in account","While it's an interesting game, there is a very steep learning curve. For someone who loves RTS games but sucks at PVP, this was a sorry disappointment when I learned I could not play cooperatively with a friend.\n\nThe interface is wonky. It's difficult to select squads of troops and common controls like shift-click to select and deselect individual units do not function. The campaigns are incredibly frustrating even on easy due to very narrow maps an inability to flank your opponent. Furthermore the campaign is scripted and tedious even when you beat your opponent. It's a relentless process of bulking up your forces and smashing the enemy's defenses head on (because you can't flank) and then waiting two or three hours with no fast-forward while scripted enemy attacks send predictable waves of troops and tanks at you. That isn't strategy. That's turtle tactics followed by spam.\n\nMultiplayer options are harshly limited. There's no CPU players. Manpower points (currency to buy units) are extremely unclear. I don't know how to view how many you have or at what rate you gain more. Command points (value of units you are allowed to command) default to 80 which is barely enough for a couple of tanks, much less troops to support them. The max, which I think is 160 or 180 or something, still limits the size of your army more than I like. There's only one game mode and it's capture the points. What happened to bases? I'd like an enemy base to go destroy and experience a real feeling of victory. Not sit on a flag until the timer runs out in a glorified King of the Hill RTS.\n\nMen of War 2 is allegedly going to have cooperative gameplay. I look forward to this. Don't get me wrong--the concept of the game is a good one. But, don't spend your money on this unless there's a good sale going on. Otherwise maybe the sequel will be better. This one is interesting enough for me to be interested in the sequel.","April 21, 2014","false","61.1"," 0 of 8 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","8","0","0"

Right up front, this game establishes itself as a hybrid RTS/Third Person Shooter allowing players to take control of individual units - tons of fun.\n\nThis game utterly fails in that it forces players to micromanage their units constantly. Individual Soldiers will often get weapons shot out of their hand, and will not automatically pick up a new weapon. Players must constantly manage resources as well (fuel, ammunition). Vehicles have insanely unrealistic fuel consumption rates which forces players to scavenge fuel from 'dead' vehicles.\n\nI think I understand where MoW was trying to go, but I feel that the micromanagement piece just takes too much away from the fact that this is a combat strategy game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tedizslayer/recommended/64000/","tedizslayer","Insano-Man","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tedizslayer/","166 products in account","Clunky, budgeted, and sometimes brutally unfair thanks to luck alone, Men of War: Assault Squad is still a rock-solid title with its own unique attributes that set it apart from Company of Heroes and other WW2 RTS titles.\n\nWhat Men of War does best is its keen focus on mimicking the reality of war. There is no such thing as a bottomless magazine, an unlimited fuel tank, or a tank with more rounds than potential targets. There is no be-all, end-all weapon to any situation and every engagement demands its own proportionate response. Wasting troops, ammunition, or even just the fuel in a vehicle can cripple that unit in engagements to come or complicate matters beyond reason.\n\nDid you use up all the high-explosive shells in a tank and now have to face off against dug-in infantry? Good luck trying to snipe them with armor-piercing rounds. Did you fire off all your mortars in a team and now have to destroy an anti-tank gun or lose one of your expensive armored vehicles? Have fun waiting for a new mortar team or supply truck while your tank takes fire it can't respond to.\n\nRange, lethality, and mobility all play crucial roles; tanks can fire far and wide across the map and receive attacks from field guns at even further distances. Vehicles can and will be destroyed in a single shot from a position far across the map or left crippled and useless by a strike to their treads, turret, or main gun. Critical anti-tank infantry or machine gunners can be shot out from under you by snipers, artillery, or even just an unlucky ricochet off of a tank's armor, all happening in the blink of an eye.\n\nEven as brutal as Men of War can be, there are often moments of forgiveness to take advantage of. Vehicles left unuseable are usually left abandoned in a state that can be salvaged. Though time-expensive, all infantry can repair a badly crippled, seemingly useless heavy tank back into fighting condition and crew it. A single rifleman with luck and determination can be used to repair and steal a damaged enemy tank right out from under their noses and bring it back to base to be fully crewed and put back to work. Most infantry fall injured rather than killed outright and swift management of a combat medic can bring decimated squads back into the fight with minimal losses. Valuable weapons can be scavenged, stolen, and re-supplied in the heat of battle by any unit, allowing a dismounted tank crew to become a formidable close quarters assault team when the right tools are left to take.\n\nA solid foundation of realism and hard-hitting micromanagement make Men of War a game worth playing, but it can often be questionable in its aesthetics department. Sometimes bizarre, universally short unit responses, average or above-average quality music with little dynamic manipulation, and a sound system that leaves much to be desired, even as much as the sounds themselves are of good quality, all contribute to an uneven audio experience. Animations that can range from goofy to floaty to eye-catchingly strange hold down its otherwise surprisingly good model quality.\n\nOverall, from my short experience in the game, Men of War is a series I wish I had gotten into sooner. Its short list of failings hardly dent what is, in the end, a game well worth its price tag. As a warning to all who consider purchasing it, I would like to note that, with GameSpy down, multiplayer may be difficult to get into or even impossible for those with problematic connections; services like GameRanger are required to do more than singleplayer, as my own experience tells me.","December 3, 2014","true","34.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While i just got a steam version (as the other retail one ive been using broke and i lost CD), so my hours on here may not appear like ive played this much despite having teh game beforehand.\n\nUnlike almost all RTS style games, this features direct control, and just like SHOWW2, an exceptional game for its time, makes combat alot more interesting then the usual point-click to tell a unit to go somewhere or attack a target.  You can manually engage cerain targets, drive yourself with WSAD, and control aspects liek reloading weapon, switching shell types, ect all manually.\n\nThe armor damage modeling is great, and while a couple bugs do exist, with the rare tank that refuses to die to anything but dynamite, overall tanks behave like you would expect them to behave in say games such a WOT or WT (although even those arent 100% realistic when it comes to shell properties and penetration).  There are a few minor inconsistencies, here and there, and weakspots arent modeled, but overall great.\n\nWith modded missions (or ones you make yourself) the game is truly amazing.  Many custom missions use units from teh game that are never deployed by the standard missions (for examle panzer 1, archer, jagdtiger, ect).  Some also are true campaign maps, such as the MoW 1 campaign port, and others.  The base game is exceptional when it comes to tools and resources it provides, but its default set of missions (even the DLC missions) tend to be rather repetitive, and aside from a different map, most of them feature the exact same set of units.\n\nThe squad mechanic is very nice, units within a squad share ammunition, and will resupply evenly when picking ammo out of trucks or dead guys.  Its also possible to disable this squad featurem, and have the selection system function more like the old SHOWW2 with individual soldiers separate from each other.\n\nThere is one particular bug that was present since the original MoW game, and apparently has never been "officially" fixed.  The tanks do on occasion get stuck refusing to target anything until either manually controlled, or given a direct order to fire at something.  Its a quick fix with a mod i made, but its kindof sad to see a bug that can be fixed by anyone who bothers to actually open up some game files and look at the targeting code to fix.  One single .cfg file that repairs this issue.\n\nAnother minor bug (again fixable with a 1 minute .cfg edit) if the flamethrower infantry refusing to attack anything outside of manual control.  Perhaps this is intentional, as fully AI flamethrowers tend to ignite anything in between them and their target, but id still say their blatant refusal to fire is a bug.\n\nFinally, while not technically a bug, the AI in the game is rather primitive.  Dont get me wrong, with a few hours in teh editor ive managed to make the AI much better, but it would be nice if the devs actually spent a little bit more time improving AI, especially pathing on some MP maps (how annoying is it to send out a AT gun, and find it stuck up a tree near spawn when you needed it the most).  Also, with proper scripting in the missions, AI is able to repair damaged tanks, retreat and regroup when their squads are mostly wiped out, be agressive and defensive with the right situations, and just be a much bigger threat, but these things all need to be manually scripted into missions, and these arent automatically done by the AI, and many things like waypoints need to be tweaked on many maps to keep tanks from driving off staircases and flipping upsidedown (looking at 1st russian skirmish mission).  AI could use a major overhaul, and after trying AS-2 on a friend's machine, i have to say it hasnt improved at all in a game that at least on paper is support to be a true sequel (more like a large patch/DLC that shouldnt be more then $10).\n\nThe default missions are rather repetitive, and even that is an understatement.  For example the USA campaign's 1st 3 missions are carbon copies of each other, every mission you get the exact same lineup of tanks, the exact same infanrty options, the exact same AT gun, ect, and the enemy is always the same, every mission you face the exact same german tanks, and the exact same infanrty at any given difficulty.  Yes the maps change, and one of them happens to have winter camo on vehicles, but aside from some maps being more open, and some being more urban styled, every single game is pretty much identical.  Now with mods, this can change, personally i run custom modded missions that vary the unitset, and actually add more unit options for friendly reinforcements, making the game less stale, and making each mission different, with some being more tank based, others infantry based, and also all of them having historical unit sets, with things like the sherman firefly removed from africa missions (firefly according to my knowledge wasnt ever deployed in africa).  With mods, the game is great, but without mods, not so much.\n\nFinally, while a minor thing that is fixed with my mods, the difficulty settings dont seem to scale that well in this game.  Easy is a complete joke, and normal isnt that easy, but seems to cut out all the somewhat hard to kill tanks.  Hard/Heroic are more my level, but the biggest issue ive found on these difficulties is so called infantry spam, where you literally have to deal with so much infantry a Wirbelwind will more or less be shooting non-stop, assuming it doesnt get killed by the tank rushes.  The difficulty ramping is alot a little bit out of whack, on hard/heroic, the missions are extremely tough initially, with the enemy having access to their top vehicles right from the start.  Expect alot and i mean ALOT of reloading saves on hard or heroic difficulty, as this level makes loosing just one tank lead to defeat.\n\n\n\nIn conclusion, the game provided a very good toolset and baseline for many mods, but sadly, the default missions are a little bit stale, especially if you expected a true single player game that like its predecessors has some storyline, or varying missions that are different from each other and other nations.  The amount of bugs is very minor, all of them fixable with mods.  The AI is above average, and while they arent scripted that great in the stock missions, they are still a challenge, capable of swarming a position you left unguarded, or defending the spot that you are assaulting fairly well.  The direct control and vast array of units are why ive always enjoyed the entire series all the way back with SHOWW2, a truly great game, that this massively expands upon in so many ways.  The squad selection and better inventory management is a great improvement from SHOWW2.  I strongly reccomend this game, even over Assault-Squad 2, when its on sale.  75% off, its around $4, and its so cheap, that anyone who is interested in this series shoudl start here.  AS-1 features many mods, has been around long enough that the majority of bugs have been patched out, and is in my opinion teh best game in the series.  If you are looking for online MP, then i have to say you must get the sequel (err overpriced DLC), its the exact same game minus like 3 or so new vehicles, a couple HD models, and some reskins for soldier camo (which anyone with MSpaint can make in 10 minutes).  LAN gaming or direct-IP connections still work, so if you have friends, MP still functions, and is arguable less buggy then the so called sequel.  FInally, i suggest against getting the game of teh year edition as the missions there arent needed for using mods, where imo all the fun stuff is at.  The only reason i got it myself is for modding resources.","January 9, 2015","true","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I have owned this since early december 2014 and at first I thought it was not very special and it was pretty short due to the fact all factions just have 3 missions each which I still think is disappointing and the fact that you can get more missions for money I also find dissapointing but as soon as my friend said there is an editor for the game I suddenly could not stop playing it, I made alternate history campaigns for all the factions I liked and then it just got better with the mods; The UNIT mod and the cold war mods (1978 mod and the modern warfare one) are my recomended ones which are fantasitc, I do dislike the fact that there is a serious amount of mods that are the same for example ones which just give you the cold war or nukes or a reskin that gives people the face of Hitler and then the good mods are either dead or still not out. Nevertheless if you look you will find hella mods that you will love. all in all I give this a 9/10","January 21, 2015","true","470.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Sure you may need a decent computer to run it, and you really need it for the editor, but if you do then it is a good game. it looks nice and has some very uniqe RTS gameplay (at least with the RTS's ive played). The Editor is not an actual option at the main game which is a little wierd. You have to go to the games directory to get to it. The Editor is also very hard to use. I couldnt even load a map without looking up a video. All in all good game, some bad things like framerate for computers not made for gaming, also the game can be very frustrating at times. And the editor just eats your framerate. AND THIS IS A WARNING FOR THE EDITOR! DO NOT SET OFF MORE THAN 1 NUKE UNLESS YOU HAVE A BEAST PC!

'nuf said\n-Better AI than most modern AAA titles\n-Very well balanced\n-Long campaign, due to some battles taking a few hours to do, as the AI, though not UBERHAXRNOVA, WILL punish you for leaving a gap in defences, and will counter your units very nicely.\n-Good learning curve\n-Outstanding graphics for a game of it's time, much better than other RTS titles released later\n-Very good economy system\n-Rarely overwhelming, the Minimap helps alot too, as it let's you plan ahead in the battle, and stay up-to-date on enemy Movements\n-Destructible cover, buildings, etc...\n-Murphy's Laws occur on anything and everything mechanical.

Its in WW2 and it has 5 factions. USA, Soviet Union, Germany, Japan and Commonwealth. Japan is the new faction introduced in this game. Overall, the game is realistic to the max, with lifelike workings and atmospheric battles. The only things that make up cons is the somewhat buggy AI and performance issues.\n\nPros:\n\nRealistic battles.\nAtmospheric battles.\nLarge skirmish campaign.\nDecent multiplayer.\nDecent amount of factions.\nOverall great RTS experience.\n\nCons:\n\nSomewhat buggy AI.\nPerformance issues.\nNo story campaign(Although I know its not oreinted around it, but it would of been nice).\n\nFor examples on the AI, I was on the first Soviet Union skirmish battle and I got one of the APC things. I moved it to a bridge and then tended to some units across the bridge. I came back to it and found it hanging off the side of the bridge. Tried to move it, didn't budge. Then I ordered the units to get out onto the bridge. It took me around 10-15 minutes to get them all out, and one of them went the totally opposite way and jumped off the bridge. Ive had some other misc. AI problems, but those are just common little problems. Thats why I said somewhat buggy AI, not completely buggy or bad AI.\n\nHope this helped, and you should buy for sure.\n\n8/10\n\nWell, between 8/10 and 8.5/10.\n\nSo basically, I recommend to get this if you can handle a bit of lag and slightly buggy AI.","August 10, 2014","true","41.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

See a building? Blow it up with a well placed artillery/tank shell. No? How about ramming your ♥♥♥♥ing tank into it, taking it down with any other person inside? What about shrapnels? Do you like shrapnels? I ♥♥♥♥ing love shrapnels. All explosions are not based on the laughable spherical "blast radiuses" but on flying razors that can cut your men 7 ways to sunday. If one of your unlucky ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s happens to be having his head over the trench when an artillery shell hits his position or a grenade hits the top side, you better ♥♥♥♥ing hope he's wearing a helmet and ducking or else you're going to have to scoop that ♥♥♥♥ for a brain of his off the ground. Disabled an enemy tank? Oh my, well did you know that you can open its inventory, take out that machine gun and ammo, then blast the ♥♥♥♥ out of the enemy? What about the fact that you can repair it on the field and use it as your own? What about the fact that EACH tank and vehicle has REALISTIC armor, sloping armor (that actually worK), and vital spots (ammo storage, fuel storage, etc.)? You can blow off their ♥♥♥♥ing tracks, turrets, and barrels for crying out loud!\n\nThe vehicles do not operate on the basis of the Company of Heroes "health bars" but on the basis of reality. Soldiers do no damage with their rifles. Tanks get damaged based on where they hit with parts breaking down, hulls being pierced, and hulls being blown to bits.\n\nThe game puts Company of Heroes to utter devastating shame. Get it.\n\nMen of War: Assault Squad is the most refined of the series with the ability to call in reinforcements and so on. I prefer the older ones (Men of War, Men of War: Red Tide, etc.) as ammo and infantry are scarce, you are forced to scavenge, repair, and loot dead bodies for cartridges, tank shells, fuel, and so on.

It may only be my favourite because I havn't played an RTS of this style before (been playing things like Command & Conquer and Warcraft). This game pushes more towards micro-managment than spamming in loads of troops to destroy your enemies which is why even though the multiplayer doesn't work (however I have heard of things that can let you play on multiplayer) the campaign will give you many hours of gameplay and if you are a fan of the RTS genre then I definatly recommend this to you.","March 31, 2015","true","12.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The problem im having, is since i didnt buy it with steam like most people, i cant play on the multiplayer with my friends, or at all. If i had bought it with steam, i could have. This is REALLY annoying, because im not spending 20 more dang dollars on it again.\n\n\nOther than that, 8/10. The gameplay is awsome, everything looks cool, but it could do with a little more realism. For example, i have a squad of soldiers, and a tank shoots them. Their helmets hit the ground, bodies disappear, a little few blotches of blood. A tank would send you flying in diffrent directions. Grenades too, RPGS's, any explsoive really. So the blood and gore factor could be better. Thats about it, i really love it other than that. Also, some buildings have ladders on it, yet my men cant climb them.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Deafjampunk/recommended/64000/","Deafjampunk","Vypr","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Deafjampunk/","42 products in account","MoW: AS is a very tough RTS. You have the ability to control anything from a single soldier to an entire platoon. Combat is intensely realistic as a platoon of infantry in the open can be cut down in seconds. Tank on Tank combat is excessively realistic to the point where most players learn why many strategists would only use tanks with infantry escort. Tracks can get blown off, guns can get destroyed, crew can get sniped from inside of the tank, and ammo racks can detonate, all depending on where a shot is placed. If a tank is damaged, it can be abandoned, or the crew can leave the tank to repair it and get back in.\n\nAside from Tank on Tank combat, Infantry combat also feels very fleshed out. Units can and will be suppresed (however, there will be no alert, they will all simply just fall to the ground and crawl to the nearest waypoint you set for them), as well as realistic logistics. No unit has infinite ammunition supplies, and if you're running low, your best option is to loot an enemy's corpse for extra ammunition, as ammunition types are universal amongst weapons with examples such as: Rifle Ammo, Pistol Ammo,  Shotshells, Machine gun belts, ect. This may not be completely realistic, but it's enough to keep the game steamlined just enough to keep gameplay fun, but not mindless.\n\nMy only complaints are:\n- There is no Players vs. AI settings in the game\n- Server connection is absolute ♥♥♥♥. You will constantly get a message saying "Connecting to server" every fifteen to twenty second. It lags the game for a half second to two full seconds, and is definitely enough to ruin the intensity of a big firefight.\n- Units are hardly autonomous. Unless you purposely want units to sit in a defensive position, you have to intensely micromanage your troops and vehicles. If you leave any unit sitting idle for long enough, it WILL be killed.\n- In multiplayer matches, there is no "deep striking" infantry unit (like American paratroopers in CoH) that can spawn where you click on the field. 173rd Airborne and Fallshirmjager are just basically elite infantry units, and hold no strategic value over your typical run-of-the-mill G.I.'s or Grenadiers.\n\nOverall the game is great, but the lack of the Player vs. AI option kills it imho. I'd recommend this only so a friend can have a taste of what a true WWII FPS should feel like, only to go back and play with what MoW: AS had failed to compete against.","June 27, 2014","true","82.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/steamscape/recommended/64000/","steamscape","nannerpuss","http://steamcommunity.com/id/steamscape/","139 products in account","Great game, but definitely not for competitive players. By that I mean if you're like me and you hate losing, you should look elsewhere for your wargaming. The AI is apparently managed by The Amazing Kreskin because they know exactly where you are at all times and exactly which units you have. If you make a move, they react immediately and without hesitation. This usually ends with a total failure in 90% of your missions. You will be restarting over and over for hours on end. Oh did I mention this is on Normal difficulty? I'm not sure why they would even include the Hard or Heroic difficulties because I can't imagine it being remotely fun. As far as I know, on Heroic the enemy would have pocket nuclear bombs, laser guided missiles and stealth bombers. During WWII.\n\nThere are certain missions where you will literally gasp at how completely you get beaten by the AI. There is no time to dig in because the longer you wait, the more tanks they bring out. I have never seen the AI run out of tanks either. On the campaign mission 'Overlord' for example I had 33 enemy tanks and tank destroyers on the map. Yes, 33 of them - I counted because I didn't think it possible. Granted they didn't get 33 out at once, but they had that many in reserve and until the very end of the mission they kept rolling them out two at a time, every few minutes. You will have enough Reinforcement Points for at most 10 tanks/tank destroyers, and that is only if you last long enough.\n\nThe real kicker is when you complete around 80% of your mission objectives the AI will throw everything they have at you, and each soldier is a military genius. Seriously, any AI grunt unit in this game would make Erwin Rommel look like a mental midget. Not to mention It takes just one single grunt to run up to your capture point and the game is over, mission failed. There is no "turnaround time" or anything. You either have the capture point or you don't. There is a "flag raising" animation when you capture or lose a point, but it's just for show and is not a timer - If the flag begins to move, it's over for either you or the enemy (99% of the time it's you).","September 9, 2014","true","199.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I want to first start by saying that this game is well made. The game developers really took their time to evalute what can make this game a great title for the genre. I believe that a game like Company of Heros has nothing on Men of War as MoW has much more to offer.\n\nPros:\nVariety of units to choose from.\nGame depth. From Squad command to individual control.\nGraphics and depthness of field.\nThe physics are good for this type of game.\nReally well-made game in my opinion.\nReplayability. Which I think is the most important.\n\nCons:\nBeing a mainly Multiplayer game it should have a better multiplayer interface than gamespy.\nOnce you complete the AI skirmishes, not much to do except buy DLCs, in terms of Computer vs Player.\nThe AI itself isint the brightest. Could be better.\nOther than these cons there are a few smaller ones but I do not think they are worth mentioning.\n\n\nWith the Part 2 comming out shortly, I hope that some of the kinks are worked out in the game and there is even more varied content from unit control to variety of units.\n\nWith a new Multiplayer interface being the most important improvement I would make on a game like this. Especially some kinda offical server or matchmaking.\n\nI do recommend this game having about 200 hours played as of this review. Good clean fun.\n\n\n","February 14, 2014","true","268.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not only can you steal enemy vehicles and guns, you can steal those vehicles' supplies and use them yourself, and then ASSUME DIRECT CONTROL with E and turn the game into a third-person shooter. You can control the inventory of individual infantry down to their damn hats and the bullets in their gun. The environments are almost entirely destructable to a striking degree of detail, which leads to awesome moments like when the bomber you call in for an airstrike is shot down by enemy forces (Yes, you can do that too) and it crashes into a house and knocks it to pieces.\nThe only two complaints I have about this game are that you can't commandeer everything on the field (Battleships, a German artillery piece in one or two missions, some boats, etc), and that there are too few singleplayer missions: only three per faction, plus the American tutorial mission. I suppose this could stem from the fact that they're all taken from real battles that faction actually won, but I think the base game could stand to have a little more replay value. Still, though, given how much fun it is to play the missions that are there, it doesn't hurt the game much.\n\n5/4/2015: I'm forced to edit my review based on my having played the sequel to this game, Assault Squad 2. It's still an excellent game, but 2 actually has everything this game has, and more - more missions, working online multiplayer, and engine improvements. This is still an excellent game, but pick up the sequel instead.","October 17, 2014","false","180.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Movement and deployment of units is intuitive and can be done from the perspective of the general or the unit itself. The one thing that's frustrating is when the enemy who you are attacking has artillery and especially anti-tank guns, when this situation arises it is almost impossible to resolve unless you are playing as Englend in which case you have the power to take those guns out with your own heavy artillery.

Yes company of heros as better graphics, sound quality, etc... However the gameplay is more in depth than ANY other rts game I have played. Being able to open up each soldiers inventory, control them individualy, and constantly having to rearm troops with ammo or shells for tanks, even the tank machine guns require ammo. You also have to make sure you have a medic on hand who can help any troops that are down (unlike COH where you need to wait 3-4 minutes for only one troop at a time) and if your medic is down no problem just pick up his gear nd carry on. Tank gameplay is also very satisfiying. The tank dammage system is much mor complex than COH. If your tank happens to catch on fire might want to bail and run before those rounds go off. you also have the ability to loot vehicals too. So if your tnk is compleatly busted and your crew low on ammo grab that 30 of 50 cal off the top and some ammo and do some rambo ♥♥♥♥ with it. Basicly to sum it up BUY THIS GAME!!!!!","September 10, 2015","true","12.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I couldnt even load a map without looking up a video. All in all good game, some bad things like framerate for computers not made for gaming, also the game can be very frustrating at times.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Deafjampunk/recommended/64000/","Deafjampunk","Vypr","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Deafjampunk/","42 products in account","MoW: AS is a very tough RTS. You have the ability to control anything from a single soldier to an entire platoon. Combat is intensely realistic as a platoon of infantry in the open can be cut down in seconds. Tank on Tank combat is excessively realistic to the point where most players learn why many strategists would only use tanks with infantry escort. Tracks can get blown off, guns can get destroyed, crew can get sniped from inside of the tank, and ammo racks can detonate, all depending on where a shot is placed. If a tank is damaged, it can be abandoned, or the crew can leave the tank to repair it and get back in.\n\nAside from Tank on Tank combat, Infantry combat also feels very fleshed out. Units can and will be suppresed (however, there will be no alert, they will all simply just fall to the ground and crawl to the nearest waypoint you set for them), as well as realistic logistics. No unit has infinite ammunition supplies, and if you're running low, your best option is to loot an enemy's corpse for extra ammunition, as ammunition types are universal amongst weapons with examples such as: Rifle Ammo, Pistol Ammo,  Shotshells, Machine gun belts, ect. This may not be completely realistic, but it's enough to keep the game steamlined just enough to keep gameplay fun, but not mindless.\n\nMy only complaints are:\n- There is no Players vs. AI settings in the game\n- Server connection is absolute ♥♥♥♥. You will constantly get a message saying "Connecting to server" every fifteen to twenty second. It lags the game for a half second to two full seconds, and is definitely enough to ruin the intensity of a big firefight.\n- Units are hardly autonomous. Unless you purposely want units to sit in a defensive position, you have to intensely micromanage your troops and vehicles. If you leave any unit sitting idle for long enough, it WILL be killed.\n- In multiplayer matches, there is no "deep striking" infantry unit (like American paratroopers in CoH) that can spawn where you click on the field. 173rd Airborne and Fallshirmjager are just basically elite infantry units, and hold no strategic value over your typical run-of-the-mill G.I.'s or Grenadiers.\n\nOverall the game is great, but the lack of the Player vs. AI option kills it imho. I'd recommend this only so a friend can have a taste of what a true WWII FPS should feel like, only to go back and play with what MoW: AS had failed to compete against.","June 27, 2014","true","82.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The Editor alone is awesome if you learn how to use it, you can create your own battles and play them in the editor while still being able to place units/objects. Noteworthy is that the battles can go for aslong as you want if played on easy and to some extent normal, if your a slower-paced game. Though this game is very hard and you will find yourself using real tactics. Assault Squad is easier than the original because its not a campaign but more a sequence of battles where YOU control the types of units you have.

The Editor alone is awesome if you learn how to use it, you can create your own battles and play them in the editor while still being able to place units/objects. Noteworthy is that the battles can go for aslong as you want if played on easy and to some extent normal, if your a slower-paced game. Though this game is very hard and you will find yourself using real tactics. Assault Squad is easier than the original because its not a campaign but more a sequence of battles where YOU control the types of units you have. Wait for 10 panthers or charge russian style with infantry, totally up to you.

Great destruction system awesome gameplay, decent graphics and great skrimish feature. I think this is the best Men of War game because of the singleplayer . I know that some people think that this game really lacks a good campaign but the skirmish feature allows you to play battles a whole lot of different ways . The multiplayer doesn´t work since the game spy servers shut down , but i don´t really care about mp in RTS games . If you are bored of playing the same maps in single you can still open the gem editor and have hours of fun with it . This game also has some great mods such as cold war mod , which allows you to play with modern units , so if you´re into modern combat you should definitely check the mod . There is also Men of War AS2 but it is nearly the same as this one but it costs much more . I totally recommend this one so if you are a RTS fan you should definitely play . The game is really cheap so there is no reason to not buy this one .","March 24, 2015","true","90.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game pushes more towards micro-managment than spamming in loads of troops to destroy your enemies which is why even though the multiplayer doesn't work (however I have heard of things that can let you play on multiplayer) the campaign will give you many hours of gameplay and if you are a fan of the RTS genre then I definatly recommend this to you.","March 31, 2015","true","12.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It does not worth 30 bucks. 10 to 15 is the maximum reasonable price.","July 20, 2014","false","105.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The plethora of units to choose from, overwhelming and mistakes are unforgiving.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Deafjampunk/recommended/64000/","Deafjampunk","Vypr","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Deafjampunk/","42 products in account","MoW: AS is a very tough RTS. You have the ability to control anything from a single soldier to an entire platoon. Combat is intensely realistic as a platoon of infantry in the open can be cut down in seconds. Tank on Tank combat is excessively realistic to the point where most players learn why many strategists would only use tanks with infantry escort. Tracks can get blown off, guns can get destroyed, crew can get sniped from inside of the tank, and ammo racks can detonate, all depending on where a shot is placed. If a tank is damaged, it can be abandoned, or the crew can leave the tank to repair it and get back in.\n\nAside from Tank on Tank combat, Infantry combat also feels very fleshed out. Units can and will be suppresed (however, there will be no alert, they will all simply just fall to the ground and crawl to the nearest waypoint you set for them), as well as realistic logistics. No unit has infinite ammunition supplies, and if you're running low, your best option is to loot an enemy's corpse for extra ammunition, as ammunition types are universal amongst weapons with examples such as: Rifle Ammo, Pistol Ammo,  Shotshells, Machine gun belts, ect. This may not be completely realistic, but it's enough to keep the game steamlined just enough to keep gameplay fun, but not mindless.\n\nMy only complaints are:\n- There is no Players vs. AI settings in the game\n- Server connection is absolute ♥♥♥♥. You will constantly get a message saying "Connecting to server" every fifteen to twenty second. It lags the game for a half second to two full seconds, and is definitely enough to ruin the intensity of a big firefight.\n- Units are hardly autonomous. Unless you purposely want units to sit in a defensive position, you have to intensely micromanage your troops and vehicles. If you leave any unit sitting idle for long enough, it WILL be killed.\n- In multiplayer matches, there is no "deep striking" infantry unit (like American paratroopers in CoH) that can spawn where you click on the field. 173rd Airborne and Fallshirmjager are just basically elite infantry units, and hold no strategic value over your typical run-of-the-mill G.I.'s or Grenadiers.\n\nOverall the game is great, but the lack of the Player vs. AI option kills it imho. I'd recommend this only so a friend can have a taste of what a true WWII FPS should feel like, only to go back and play with what MoW: AS had failed to compete against.","June 27, 2014","true","82.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

What am i talking about? Well lets just get down to it.\n\nThe game focuses on a "reinforcements" system like waves in a horde game, where you can buy reinforcements for the points you get from the flags on the map. These flags also unlock new toys to play with, and turns the point in your favour, giving you turrets and such pointing in the opposite direction.\n\nThere are several "clans" to choose from, each having their own 'special' heavy weapons. There are the USA, Nazi Germany, Soviet Russia, The Japanese, And the Common Wealth, each having their own levels and obstacles.\n\nThe game focuses on 'realistic' warfare, though i will say its much more realistic than Company Of Heroes, as each soldier has a bag pack with ammo, helmet, shovel, you name it. They can be divided into smaller or bigger squad of units or be controlled by the player in a simplistic way if you find that the soldier's aim is off. They have their own health bars and can do anything themselfs without relying on their squad to follow them, so you can take the rocketeer out of your squad, take manual control of him, run around your position, and blow up whatever that was pinning you down. Soldiers will even keep their head low while under heavy fire and sometimes heal themselfs in mid combat *Something that is allways useful when you're busy micro managing*.\n\nsmaller Anti fortification and tank machines like mortars are also dynamic, as you can damage several parts of the map to clear a shot for your soldiers, or break a certain part of a tank. Is a tank Plowing down your formation? aim for the trackers. Is the gunner constantly cathing your soldiers? Order your soldiers to aim for the gunner turret. Not only does it feel amazing, its also neccesary to keep your waves up.\n\nNow... For the bad things. Remember how i mentioned the Ai is quite dynamic? Yeah, that's 30% of the time. The other 70% they will stand and glare at you before actually opening fire, or they will stand still INFRONT OF A TANK waiting for the 'throw grenade' animation to start. SPEAKING OF WHICH! One of the most important parts of the infantry is the ability to quickly get around or get rid of Armored targets, well somebody at 1C COMPANY must have had a good time when he decided your soldiers wouldn't be able to make up its own bloody mind when you send it to throw a grenade at a tank, leaving them 80% crawling slowly towards it while you furiously click on the 'stand up and charge it' button, leaving them open for a gang r^^e by turrets.\n\nRemember i mentioned this game is dynamic? Yeah, its so dynamic it dosen't even tell you what's good against what. Oh suuuure it gives you a in-depth look of how big the gun is, or how thick the armor is on the left side of what you're viewing, but if you don't know anything before hand about WORLD WAR 2, you're basically left to guess as to which tank is good against which. So you better whip out those WORLD WAR 2 war books kids, or else you'll be fu^^^^ harder than the Japanese fleet when they first fought the Americans.\n\nI really do think you can have a great time in this game, and there are a LOT of hours to be had here, but the AI problems and the lack of tutorilization on all the Panzer just leaves me with a sour taste in my mouth. I will however reccomend the game to you if you have ever wanted the Big Name countrys from world war 2 to band together and destroy some evil snowman tanks, or make a steak for the summer peace festival.","November 16, 2015","false","26.6"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"
