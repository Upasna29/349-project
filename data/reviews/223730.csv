While its core element of 'collect stuff and get to the end of the level' doesnt bring a ton thats new to the table, it still has plenty to entertain with. The visuals are quite lovely to look at, the soundtrack is very well composed and always fits, and piloting each of the 4 different characters and their unique powers keeps the game from getting stale. With the press of a button, the world around you shifts color, appearance, music and objects which you interact with. Navigating through the maze-like levels can be confusing at times due to this, but Ive never gotten stuck to the point I had to refer to a walkthrough.\n\nDont let its pretty facade fool you though- this game can be obnoxiously difficult later on, with plenty of areas requiring split-second timing as you run, glide, stick to walls, fly, bounce in an invulnerable balloon, shift dimensions and try not to hit those glowing red nasties that youll be plenty familiar with in the first few levels. Fortunately, you have unlimited lives; when you die youre immediately zapped back to a checkpoint, and you can even avoid death by pressing a button that LETS you go back to your "spawn".\n\nAll in all, a great independent title that should amuse for a good ~20 hours, and at a cheap 10 bucks (currently $3.39 on holiday sale thru Steam) youre not going to feel ripped off even if you somehow DONT like it. Just look at the demo videos, they should say enough!","December 19, 2013","true","28.8"," 50 of 55 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","50","55","0","0"

There are four different kinds, which all have the same ability to double jump, glide, and switch states of the level. Each Bud has a unique ability that is used to solve certain puzzles in the game. The levels range from run and jump platforming to solving puzzles using a certain character. While things may seem easy at first, the levels get harder to be actually quite challenging. The puzzles grow to involve using more characters together in one level and more challenging level layouts. The normal levels have no timer, except for certain levels that are more linear in nature and involve outrunning a rising sea of junk. These speedrun kind of levels are the harder levels in the game, due to the strict time limits and higher bar for platforming skill. A boss battle occurs at the end of each world, complete with more puzzle platforming to navigate through and win. The levels are all fun to play through and try to solve, with levels tending to take around 5-10 minutes or maybe more depending on the pace of play.\nControling the characters feels natural and responsive at times. Sometimes, moving the Buds around feels not as refined as they might sometimes move too fast when not needed to be or don't jump as high enough. Still, the controls are solid and work well with only a few quirks that may pop up when playing the game.\n\nThe art style of Fly'n is very, very well drawn. The characters have a simplistic design with solid colors and simple shapes. On the other hand, the worlds are highly detailed with lots of color and intricate designs on the surfaces of each level. The world styles range from natural inspired designs with foilage, to more abstract designs and mechanical parts. Changing the state of the level turns the world to silhouettes or a more tinted color. The animation is also really well done both ingame and in the cutscenes. The characters themselves are simple in design, but are animated so smoothly that it feels natural. The cutscenes are also of high visual quality, owing in part that both the ingame and cutscene character data are both from the same source material. With high details with great animation and drawing style, the art style is very pleasing to look at and play with.\n\nThe music in Fly'n adds a nice backdrop to the graphical design. The songs tend to be relaxed in nature or more frantic depending on what level is going on. There is a fair variety of tracks present in the game, ranging from light, instrumental pieces to faster paced rock or electronic styles. The music does its job in adding to the style of the game, and they do sound great to listen to as well.\n\nFly'n does have a story, albiet a weird one. Basically, a hair dryer collects garbage and dumps them everywhere. The hair dryer dumps it on the worlds where the Buds are. It's up to the Buds to stop the hair dryer from dumping more garbage on their worlds. Anyway, the cutscenes themselves tend to be silly in nature and a little bit weird in terms of storytelling. The story isn't amazing, but tends to silly and help drive the game.\n\nFly'n gives a full 10 hour game with fun and challenging puzzle platforming, set in a world that looks and feels great with the art and animation quality. This game is definitely a joy to play and does provide some great puzzles, all wrapped up in very well done style for the game's setting.","August 21, 2014","true","13.7"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","11","12","0","1"

YES I KNOW HOW FREAKING PREDICTABLE THAT SOUNDS! but its true, very enjoyable game with some honestly gorgeous 2D graphics, tons of personality and a very acceptable level of challenge\n\nplaying this game simply makes feel good, a mix of great 2D art, calm soundtrack and a very forgiving gameplay\n\nyou control a little bug(?) with the ability to swift between 2 dimensions as well as many other acquired abilities like sticking to walls, dash through the air and bouncing around, the objective is to reach the end of each stage with some collectables along the way, the levels are non-linear and the puzzles are very well designed, it can be tricky at times, but the checkpoint system makes sure it doesnt take long to get back in the action\n\nmy mayor complain is i guess, the fact the first half of the game is much better than the rest, the first power you get, sticking to walls, is much more interested and better implemented than the dashing and bouncing you are able to use later, bouncing can be specially problematic since it lacks finesse and precision\n\noverall very enjoyable and quite a bit long, it took me 12 hours to complete and i havent even checked any of the secret levels, indie puzzle platformers are a dime a dozen nowadays, but this is one of the few actually worth your time and money","December 19, 2013","true","12.7"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

No matter how you look at the game and even if you don't like platformers you have to admit that the complete game is looking fantastic.\n\nThe story is told fast: A hairdryer called Dyer is attacking the world trees in order to rob their energy the "Helys". To prevent this, the world trees have created the buds to stop Dyer  polluting the trees even more.\n\nFly'n  is a platformer. You are trying to reach the top of the different trees and fight the specific world boss there. Every world consist of 7 levels plus one boss level and three bonus level (exception is the last world with only one bonus level) so there is a lot to do and the game is gradually getting harder. You have four different buds and every bud has its own special ability. Fly'n can sing and activate the Helys and revive the inhibitants of Helica, Lyft can stick to any (unpolluted) surface and crawl on them, Ywok can transform to a ball and bounce around and Nyls can propel himself (up to three times). And all Buds can jump, double-jump and glide. You can not change the buds freely everywhere, only in the specific checkpoints which is a good thing because you don't have to think too much with whom you have to solve a specific part of the level. Additional to all the abilites the buds can also change between two visions which may make different parts of the level solid and/or accessible.\n\nAs for the difficulty: If you only try to reach the exit it should only need patience since you may die as often as you "wish" and you will restart from the last checkpoint. But you should notice that the game has been tagged as "hard" so keep that in mind. It may look cute but you need to know what you are doing. For those looking for a higher challenge there are different options: You may try to "complete" the levels which means you explore more and collect all the Helys and pollen which are hidden. If you are still not satisfied you can try to play the levels without dying. And for the motivated there are the Leaderboards where you can compare your points to the rest of the playership.\n\nAll in all I think I can't recommand this game enough. I bought the game on release day and never regretted it. I put more than 100 hours into this game which says a lot. The buds are lovable and each world has a different beautiful design. If you like platformers you have little to no reason to not buy and play Fly'n. All this is rounded up with a beautiful soundtrack which you can and should buy aswell.","June 30, 2013","true","123.9"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","3"

You can get further abilities the more you progress in the game, which varies your gameplay experience, while you can also revisit older levels for 100% completion. The music enhances the relaxed atmosphere of the game and its art style should be envied by accomplished titles.\n\nThe reason I do not recommend it for the average player is that I have found the difficulty level growing significantly, relatively early in the game, with no option whatsoever to adjust it for a smoother experience. This is a great shame for not so skilled players, who can miss the majority of the beautiful worlds portrayed in Flyn, and turn their experience frustrating instead of relaxing. Would definitely recommend it though, if your platforming skills are above average, or you like a hard challenge.

All of them can double jump and glide, but the blue one can sing, green one can turn to a lettuce that sticks to any surface so he can climb walls and stuff, the black one can turn into a bouncy ball and the red one can dash multiple times being able to cross large distances even vertically.\nThe goal is to reach the end of the level while collecting as many floating seeds that simply give you score and weird glowing balls that you use to solve certain puzzles. There is also a timer and leaderboards so if you like going OCD over collecting everything and getting the best time and score possible, this game's got you covered.\n\nThere are 2 kinds of levels. In most of them, you have infinite time to finish and collect everything but once in a while the game throws the other kind at you, where you must rush upwards as fast as possible because there is red garbage rising from below that kills you if you touch it. So the pace of the game kinda alternates between slow (not if you are speedrunning, but you CAN go slow), methodical gameplay and frantic mandatory speedrunning which is something I liked, it kept me engaged.\nThere is also a bonus available when you don't die on those speedy levels which I found absolutely rage-inducing because some of the later ones are VERY difficult, but it does give you a reason to try and master the game so I still consider it a good thing.\nOverall, I find this game great. Great visuals, interesting gameplay mechanics and  the price is almost suspiciously low.

The gamepad controls, platforming and level design are solid and the game provides a challenge even for players experienced with platformers. There's enough incentive to 100% levels for the unlockable concept art, puzzle rooms and easter eggs in the home areas and, on rising lava levels, solely for the satisfaction you'll feel if you manage to pull off a perfect run. Having no reason to replay levels or improve my skill to perfect them is an area where I'm let down by quite a few indie platformers, so it's nice to see another one doing it right.\n\nAcquiring new forms, each with unique platforming abilities, and being required to shift between them adds to the fun, and they're introduced at a rate that revives the learning curve just when you think you're getting comfortable and keeps things from getting too repetitive.  Regardless of which form you're in, you'll also be required to shift between two dimensions where platforms, collectibles, obstacles and hazards appear and disappear—adding another element of timing and skill to the formula, similar to the new Giana Sisters.\n\nYou'll die a lot trying to perform well on the timed levels; fortunately, there are plenty of stages you can explore at your own pace in between these skill checks and boss battles.  Watch the Steam trailer if you're considering picking this up; in this case, it accurately showcases how the game plays and whether it's something you're likely to enjoy.","March 21, 2013","true","8.7"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","3"

The art and animation are gorgeous! The audio is pretty nice too.\n\nYou control 4 different characters that all have double jump/float and a special power. 1 crawls on walls, 1 can bounce on deadly surfaces, 1 can dash any direction for long distances, and the last is the least maneuverable but sort of a key. In each area you're trying to use the available characters to explore and open up areas for the other bugs (or locate spawn areas for a different character).\n\nThe movement feels really tight with just the right amount of skill and finesse. You can also swap between light/dark words at any time to toggle certain platforms, walls, and deadly areas. So often you'll do something like: double jump and stick to a wall, detach, toggle off a dangerous platform above, air jump through it, toggle a platform above off, double jump through it, toggle the platform back on, and land. The trick jumps get much crazier from there... the difficulty is somewhere between Sonic and Super Meat Boy, but it never feels unfair.\n\nAnyway, if you ever miss challenging old school platformers or want to see where the evolution of platforms has gone, check this one out. I finished in about 8 hours, but missed most of the secrets which unlock bonus levels.","May 25, 2013","true","10.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Play it in windowed instead of full screen and you'll likely have no issues, otherwise you'll get FPS drags/spikes randomly. Though it seems this bug doesn't affect some older PCs. Anyway, the backgrounds, characters, and creatures are so colorful and vibrant. You'd swear an artist came in and beautifully painted each area.\n\nThe characters are really cute and well animated, not to mention the main antagonist is a....hair dryer named Dyer. You play as the four buds of the world trees- Flyn (blue), Lyft (green), Ywok (black), and Nyls (orange). Each has a different ability that will come in handy as you progress through the stages. There will also be "chase" stages where you have to make it to the end without dying once, so that you can save some of the various creatures of the world trees. If you want to know a little more about them, check out the commuity guide about them.\n\nGameplay goes fairly quick, even if you end up dying a lot. You have unlimited lives and if you get stuck, you can just "pop" yourself back to the respawn point. This game can be quite difficult, but it helps you get used to the pace and characters. Each level is more difficult than the previous, but also challenges you to think of new ways to use the buds. Like Ywok for instance can turn into a ball, so in the earlier stages you'll see guidelines of collectables on how to bounce at the right angle, but later on the angles get more specific and require good timing. There are also a bunch of bonus levels (tied to rescuing of creatures in chase stages) that are much, much harder than the normal ones. I would suggest tackling those after completing the game. Oh, and of course, there are boss levels at the end of each tree, which challenge you to use the buds to the best of their abilities. You may die a lot and you will get frusterated, but the music and sights help take the edge off.\n\nThe music is beautiful and if you enjoy it, definitely grab the soundtrack. It's soothing and appropriate to each area. In the beginning of each level it starts out softly, but as you progress through the level more beats are added. I feel like it adds some fun to progressing through.\n\nThere isn't any dialogue to the story. It's told mostly through cutscenes and it's pretty clear about what is going on. I feel there is also some story related visuals in some of the levels, but generally it's the cute cutscenes.\n\nTo me, the only real complaint is the bug I mentioned previously, but thankfully has a simple workaround. It only took me about 10 hours total to complete the game, so it's short and sweet. If you want to see some gameplay or check out the design, feel free to check out my Let's Play here.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCnxk6ZtV-s&index=1&list=PL3p2paDTsxxQ_aNsQji43jczJ_MB36OUi\n\ntl;dr Great, beautiful game with progressing difficulty. One bad bug, but easily squashed running windowed.","April 22","true","13.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You can play as 4 characters, each one with a different ability: one can activate objects and open ways, one can stick to surfaces, one can bounce and pass through lethal obstacles and one can dash in the air. Also, all of them have a dream ability that makes the level switch to an alternate "dimension" where some objects appear and others disappear: jumping from one to another while switching repeatedly will require precision and reflexes, and in the last levels the game will get intense. Several levels are nonlinear and there's a bit of puzzle solving. There are many hidden collectibles and some bonus levels. The game lenght is 5-7 hours for just finishing the story and around 40 hours for completing it at 100%.\n\nThe art is gorgeous, the music is engaging and the style is charming. The story is very simple but cute and has imaginative characters.\n\nThe flaws of the game are the bouncing ability which is quite unpredictable and a few collectibles that are too hard to find or get (remember to notice the "flowing sparkles").\n\nI give it a 8.7/10.","January 5, 2015","true","47.5"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

If you want a casual platformer feel free to beat it perfunctorily. But to discover all hidden things and collect all stuff you need to play very skillful because it is a bit of a challenge.

The level design can be a bit evil at times hiding things in places you might not go into or sometimes rare sections in some levels that can only be progressed once and can't go back (unless you were to restart the level).

Throughout that time, I have been playing video games. But rarely do I find a game that truly makes me say 'this is what I've been waiting for.'\n\nFly'N is one of those rare gems. This is one of those games I have always wanted to play. A seamless, challenging, atmospheric platformer with an unusual method of control and gameplay; both in a good way mind you. Each of the four characters brings a new gimmick to the table, and the sheer, painstakingly creative level designs take advantage of them in a way that will simply astound you.\n\nEverything about this game is beautiful. The asethetic, the gameplay, the levels (though, some of the rising levels are admittedly questionable), the music, and of course, the price! Its insane for Ankama to be asking a mere $10 for this. Most $60 games these days don't have a quarter of the quality and love you will find in this game. Christmas already came this year. It came on November 9th, 2012.\n\nPick this up immediately.

For me, it was VERY difficult. A lot of the moves required very precise motions of the analog stick and very precise timing on multiple buttons, often at the same time. I am not as young as I once was, and I am afraid that my reflexes are no longer fast enough for a game like this. For the parts that I was able to complete (the first half of the game) it was a lot of fun. The art is great, the sounds are cool, and your character is very cute. The game is fast paced and fun for the most part, my thumbs were sore after playing for a while on my controller. If you are young and have fast reflexes, this game would be a treat for people who like fast paced platform action games.

Still, the game didn't feel tedious either because the excellent aesthetics of the game mean that wherever you go you'll be seeing something pretty nice.\n\nThe game can be pretty hard on some puzzles.  Sections of the game near the end can be very execution heavy.  The last level had me at 86 deaths when my usual on bad stages was 12 or so.  Tthe game DOES make some optional collectables devilishly tricky to acquire as well.\n\nGo play DYER HIT WORLD on newgrounds for a little backstory on this game too.\n\nNot bad for a $10 title, a lot better than some other puzzle platformers.  I got 12 hours in with main game cleared and only 5 or so bonus stages completed, many collectables not yet acquired.  The soundtrack is good too, I would reccomend it.\n\nAlso the villain stripteases at the end of the credits.  He's a hairdryer brought to life.

The first few levels are fairly easy, but the difficulty really ramps up by the second world, and it becomes very challenging, as well as introducing new mechanics in each world as new characters are added in.  The art style is also great, with a cute cartooney aesthetic.\n\nOne criticism is that it can be a bit unclear in actually telling you how things work.  The developers seem to have deliberately avoided providing text almost anywhere, and some things (particularly the interface for choosing level etc) can be a bit obtuse because of that.  Other times, some mechanics are not really communicated to the player.  The controls are also a bit odd (left mouse button to jump feels a bit strange).\n\nOn the whole though, a decent game, well worth checking out if you like platformers.","August 12, 2014","true","7.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you're a fan of 2D platformers like me, and you don't mind using different abilities to traverse levels, then this is the game for you.  This game is a lot of fun, but it's also quite punishing when you die.  There's a lot of replay value...you can replay levels to get a better score and save more creatures.  Creative use of each character's abilities is present in this game.\n\nIt can definitely get difficult at some points.  I'm on world 4 right now and it's defintely a lot harder than the previous worlds.  There are essentially 3 types of levels: casual levels (where you can take your time and collect all the little dittys), rush/timed levels (these levels are intense...an unstoppable rising pool of lava is out to destroy you), and boss levels.\n\nBoss levels are well designed.  Each of them is a mechanical machine that you need to traverse using the abilities that you are given.  Then once you beat the boss, you make your way inside the machine and disable it from the inside.\n\nThe rush/timed levels are the only gripe I have about this game.  I think there are too many of them.  If you die, you don't save the creature at the top.  If you die too many times, the game pretty much tells you "You suck" and a dialog appears that gives you the option of turning off the rising pool of lava.  These levels are designed to be hardcore, and it's pretty much impossible to NOT die your first time through.\n\nAll in all I would definitely recommend this game.  If your feverishly addicted to platformers like I am, this is not one to miss.  I rate this game an 8/10 with a BADASS seal of approval.  I love the art style and the music is amazing.

The emphasis of this game is on the platforming but the levels are laid out in a way that makes it more puzzley, having to backtrack and figure out where you are headed.\n\nThe game starts out simple enough, and seems very casual friendly, but as you unlock more characters, the levels get harder and the difficulty becomes very steep towards the end of the game.\n\nI love the visuals in this game. It has a cute art style that is completely unique. You begin to appreciate the world you're involved in.\n\nThe gameplay itself revolves around trying get through basic levels, but between all the collectables, and the different characters you use, it doesn't feel very linear. This can be frustrating or enjoyable, depending on the level and depending on the type of player you are. The mechanics are very solid, the game controls well and the mechanics that each creature has lends itself to creative play. The Black creature, which uses a bouncing mechanic was difficult for me to get the hang of, but once you understand it, it can become quite fun to play around with.\n\nThe game took me about 6 hours to completion, without collecting much and without doing the bonus levels. I was very satisifed and felt very challenged towards the end. This game might become too challenging for a more casual audience, as I'm use to playing more hardcore platformers.\n\nThe boss fights were also interesting as they were focused on the platforming itself, which I feel is the right call instead of a typical "jump on the bad guy" playstyle you might see in platformers\n\nThe story is hit or miss, I wasn't 100% sure what was going on but the cutscenes were still enjoyable to watch.\n\nPros\n-Great length for the price, good value\n-Solid and Unique Mechanics\n-Lot of extras in levels and beyond\n-Interesting Boss Fights\n-Awesome Art Style\n-Challenging, bit steep on difficulty curve\n\nCons\n-Saw Minor Frame Rate Drops at some portions\n-Might be too challenging for casual play\n-Nonlinear level layout may confuse players\n-Some players might feel overburdened by the large amount of mechanics\n\n\nI really enjoyed Fly'N and I highly recommend it. Even a casual player will enjoy the early portions of the game. This is another must have platformer on steam if you love this genre.

It piles on the cute factor by the bucketload as I found myself going "awww!" on far too many occasions as the adorable buds repair the damage of the inhabitants of stunning worlds ruined by electrical garbage\n\nDon't be fooled though... this isn't for the light hearted. The difficulty becomes fantastically challenging to the point that I was breaking a sweat on many occasions. It's tough, but you get infinite lives and feel like a complete boss when you execute it perfectly. I'd definitely recommend a controller for this one, as the keyboard might be a bit awkward at times\n\nThe only thing where this game really fails... the ending. It grudgingly just felt very rushed. Maybe I've played too much Sonic and want to enjoy utterly wrecking a big, evil machine in the final level - but it weirdly switched from the fun boss fights it had throughout to basically dying repeatedly whilst you learn the sequence to basically avoid dying. After the anti-climatic level; the end doesn't seem to conclude much too. Without spoiling it, you kinda get a "yay! It's all sorted"... without anything really being sorted. There's still 4 tree worlds completely wrecked with garbage. It just really sucked considering how well the game had been executed up to that point\n\nIn the grand scheme of things - it's a small gripe, as I got 10+ fantastic and gripping hours out of this game (just the basic game too... I've still to find all the goodies on the levels and complete the bonus ones) - but I found the end leaves you with a bit of an "oh... that's it?"","August 19, 2015","true","12.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The feel fluid and versatile with fast movement, a glide and a double jump on top of their special abilities. Pacing is great, each character's gimmick is useful and fun (once you master its controls anyways) and immersion is great. All the secrets offer decent replayability. Also it's got great aesthetics and is undeniably cute.\n\nLevels alternate between two types. The first is large and immersive, with plenty of secrets and platforming and mild puzzles. The others are difficult death courses where you race against rising spikes. On each world this leads up to VERY difficult (but well-designed) bosses each followed by a handful difficult but non-timed deathtraps. There's no level skips so you probably won't beat the game if you're not very good, but you don't have to be godly either and it's not a constant slew of death courses like most games which are as difficult as it gets at its peaks.","February 15, 2014","true","24.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You won't get on the leaderboard in easy mode, however.

The emphasis of this game is on the platforming but the levels are laid out in a way that makes it more puzzley, having to backtrack and figure out where you are headed.\n\nThe game starts out simple enough, and seems very casual friendly, but as you unlock more characters, the levels get harder and the difficulty becomes very steep towards the end of the game.\n\nI love the visuals in this game. It has a cute art style that is completely unique. You begin to appreciate the world you're involved in.\n\nThe gameplay itself revolves around trying get through basic levels, but between all the collectables, and the different characters you use, it doesn't feel very linear. This can be frustrating or enjoyable, depending on the level and depending on the type of player you are. The mechanics are very solid, the game controls well and the mechanics that each creature has lends itself to creative play. The Black creature, which uses a bouncing mechanic was difficult for me to get the hang of, but once you understand it, it can become quite fun to play around with.\n\nThe game took me about 6 hours to completion, without collecting much and without doing the bonus levels.

It piles on the cute factor by the bucketload as I found myself going "awww!" on far too many occasions as the adorable buds repair the damage of the inhabitants of stunning worlds ruined by electrical garbage\n\nDon't be fooled though... this isn't for the light hearted. The difficulty becomes fantastically challenging to the point that I was breaking a sweat on many occasions. It's tough, but you get infinite lives and feel like a complete boss when you execute it perfectly. I'd definitely recommend a controller for this one, as the keyboard might be a bit awkward at times\n\nThe only thing where this game really fails... the ending. It grudgingly just felt very rushed. Maybe I've played too much Sonic and want to enjoy utterly wrecking a big, evil machine in the final level - but it weirdly switched from the fun boss fights it had throughout to basically dying repeatedly whilst you learn the sequence to basically avoid dying. After the anti-climatic level; the end doesn't seem to conclude much too. Without spoiling it, you kinda get a "yay! It's all sorted"... without anything really being sorted. There's still 4 tree worlds completely wrecked with garbage. It just really sucked considering how well the game had been executed up to that point\n\nIn the grand scheme of things - it's a small gripe, as I got 10+ fantastic and gripping hours out of this game (just the basic game too... I've still to find all the goodies on the levels and complete the bonus ones) - but I found the end leaves you with a bit of an "oh... that's it?"","August 19, 2015","true","12.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
