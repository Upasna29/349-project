Maybe you have to have made a special kind of experience to aknowledge and value the metaphor that is being told. It is an extremely deep, meaningful gaming experience, that transports an important message to all workaholics and career-fetishists. Additionally it is filled with humour, witty comments, smart cross-references to pop-culture and the gaming industry.\n\nIf you like intellectual & philosophically challenging games like Ether One or Mindpath To Thalamus you definitly should give this title a try. Explore the details. Enjoy the weirdness. Wait for the mind ♥♥♥♥.\n\nI highly recommend this title, although I fear that not many gamers will have the patience to experience the whole master piece (which is a pity). Thank you Phosphor Games for an utterly interesting game! I hope that you took the moral of your game to your heart during the development of this title itself ;)","August 27, 2015","true","4.0"," 91 of 113 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","91","113","0","0"

Sort of similar to Lifeless Planet in this regard. However, unlike Lifeless Planet, this game just kind of droned on. It took me a little less than three hours to complete, and I really wish it had taken about half that. It became a very boring affair going out to basically do the same things over and over with minor changes to your base in between. That actually kind of killed the immersion for me.\n\nAs far as the actual gameplay, it was pretty smooth. It's an exploration game, so you really just move about, jumping and when available, using your jetpack to navigate alien planets. You will interact with your objectives, but mostly you just take in the visuals and listen to what also seemed like overly long dialogue.\n\nNow, I dont want to pan this too hard because it is evident that this game was a labor of love, and it definitely had its positives, but overall, I just ended up finding myself bored. The pacing never changes throughout. Just sort of you wandering at what amounts to a casual pace with, as mentioned before, somewhat droning dialogue.\n\nI'd say it is worth checking out when you dont have anything else you'd like to play or simply want an interlude between other games, but I'd also bet you will end up feeling bored like I did.\n\n5 out of 10 for me personally. I'm giving it a no as a recommendation because, like I say, it ends up just being boring.","December 22, 2015","false","2.8"," 27 of 33 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","27","33","0","5"

Maybe I Should start with the bad things fisrt.\n\nSo I had two cons about this game\n\nOne, the optimization, Oh lord, the optimization is poor. My frame rate was terrible and I had to have my settings set to low the entire time, and I STILL had crap frames. It was terrible, but I paid the 15 dollars for it so, at first, I thought, ok lets just push through that and see what the game has to offer gameplay wise.\n\nMy second and only other gripe with the game was that I would occasionally glitch through the floor when I would jump, so nothing to out of the ordinary there.\n\nAs for the Pros, Well...\n\nThe first time you wake up you're on your ship. Its a pretty self sustained looking palce....but you've just crash landed due to some unseen force, so the automated messages play thoughout the ship and have you walk through for your mission breifing. after that, once those doors open, things get weird, The good kind of weird. Throughout the first half of the first planet you're on, this robot, the AVA if I remember correctly, walks you through your mission, which is placing becons on the planet to map it out while she calls for a distress signal. once you place the becons down, she says she can not find a signal and tells you that you will die alone. She then loses all he battery power and drops to the dirt, lifeless. and now you're all alone right?.....Right?\n\nThe events that happen after wards? well, you need to play this yourself if you can, because I woulnd't want to spoil it for you. Is it worth 15 buckaroos? I would wait for it to go on sale, maybe catch it at 10 or hell, I bought this at 10% off and  Idont regret it. If you got the money to spend, I would recommend getting this and playing it through. From what I could tell, it controls nice, the story is incredibly amazing and as of this review, it leaves me wondering what happens next.\n\nOh, and if there just so happens to be a content creator ("youtuber") out there reading this. I think It would make for some pretty decent content.","August 26, 2015","true","0.8"," 48 of 70 people (69%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","69","48","70","2","2"

This is your final mission...\n[SPOILERS FREE]\n\nCorpse of Discovery is a first-person surreal exploration game published and developed by Phosphor Games Studio, Phosphor games can be known for developing popular postapocalyptic survival game Nether and also for making great mobile titles such as Horn, The Dark Meadow and The Path to Luma.\nIn this game you will find all the things that Phosphor Games puts in their games - amazing atmosphere, stunning artwork and really well made live-action parts inside the game (watch live-action trailer for Nether and you'll understand what I mean). All their games are made with great passion and happen to be really unique. And CoD is not an exception.\nIn CoD you will start each day with a main objective, normally to explore a vast unknown planet. There're six of them. While playing your character's only wish is to finish the mission and return back home to his family. But each mission ends under very strange circumstances, leaving you with more unresolved questions and zero answers. And it's up to you to find out how to return home in this interactive story, more often called as "walking simulator".\nThis isn't a usual game for everyone and sometimes it can become weird but not less enjoyable. For me personally this game was a great experience and huge relaxation, it was like watching an epic space drama such as Moon or 2001: A Space Odyssey, but here you can actually feel that you're taking part in it. The voice acting also got a very nice touch and AVA will make you smile, especially in the end of the game :)\nThe game mechanics are relatively simple, you can interact with objects, walk, sprint, jump and later on use a jetpack. The controls are fluent and easy to use.\nThe game design is remarkable, environments are diverse, flora feels really natural, as fauna you have aliens and extraterrestrial animals, levels feel big, even though you don't need to go far away and explore the limits.\nOverall the game is fantastic. I really had an adventure playing it and I definitely recommend it to everyone who tired of hardcore gaming. Just make yourself a favor and buy this game as a ticket for an epic journey, which will take you through the whole spectrum of emotions. It's truly beautiful.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=535489205\nP.S. Don't forget to check all the secondary objectives, there you can find some really cool easter eggs!","October 23, 2015","true","7.5"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fjonan/recommended/297720/","fjonan","(-C-)Fjonan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fjonan/","398 products in account","I'd call it a narrative experiment that takes inspirations by recent science-fiction movies like "Moon" or "Interstellar" with a more passive "walking simulator" approach with a good amount of platforming in the mix when moving around. I loved what it tries story wise even if it in my opinion lacks a good amount of polish which I think stems from the small team that really tried to get a lot in. But that is also one of the main problems I had with the game: it could have been half as long. Getting from one objective to the other gets tedious and does not further the feeling of loneliness but being in a game ticking boxes. It pains me to think that so much energy was used to make the game larger, when the opposite would have made it that much more focused.\n\nBut even with all it shortcomings I can appreciate the core concept of what it is trying to convey. It touches on many topics, some on the sidelines, some major (the holo-messages were relly moving) and it shines through that the game is trying more than it ultimately can handle. I would love to read some interpretations on the story in the forums (which I will not mention here because of spoilers) and I want the developers to keep going in this direction and get better at it, because this kind of game is still uncommon and I like it for it.\n\nIf you like new experiences in games and if you have no problems with an indie diamond-in-the-rough I reccomend taking a look. This, for me, is an example that shows that games can be much more than mere mechanics tied together by a cheesy story you don't care about.","April 5","true","3.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

As per the trailer, there's commentary on family life in the context of this very distant line of work. Without getting into specific spoilers, there's a pretty solid analogy being made in this narrative that hit home with me. It's not subtle, which is... perhaps just the roughness of a quick indie-type dev cycle (even if this isn't really an indie title). That doesn't bother me much. It lacks polish, but the core of the thing works.\n\nIt's surreal narrative arc with a cycle of progression not unlike Groundhog's Day (the movie), a floating drone assistant that goes through several personality shifts. And it drops existentialist bombs on the regular. The game tells you from the beginning that you will succeed, that your mission is nearly complete, and that you will be reward upon your return home. As one might guess from the cover art, all does not go well.\n\nAlso, I'm pretty sure I'm smack dab in the middle of the target audience for this narrative. There are a bunch of details in there that describe things in my life almost eerily accurately, so that's fascinating. The whole tone of the thing is weird and sad, and at the end I felt weird and sad, even though it didn't explicitly tell me to feel that way, so I think the design is working.\n\nIt's rough experiment, through and through, but I was compelled to finish. It leaves me wanting to see a new game about this organization and to be able to do more hands-on science in this universe. Also- the LAVA planet is awesome.

With regards to game play: You explore surreal and bizarre landscapes on different planets. You face several deadly challenges, such as dangerous plants, alien life-forms, deadly radiation and deep abysses.

A parallel commentary from the in game character and the Game Designer. (One of the Game Designer's family plays the family of the protagonist in game)  I beat the game in right about 5 hours. No crashes or glitches. My wife watched me play and she and I both really felt the emotional impact moments from the game. I thought there were spots for some achievements, but maybe not many. The game starts out as a straightforward mystery, and then takes a turn to the surreal. This is more of a game to inspire contemplation rather than wrap everything up nicely. Most of the progression on the mystery is done via optional objectives, and if you don't do them you will be totally lost at the end. If you do all of the optional objectives the message of the game is deceptively easy to understand and only obfuscated by the preconceptions that you bring. Good game. Surreal ending, but good game.","August 29, 2015","true","5.6"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

I was really excited for the first 15 minutes when I saw the impressive graphics of the living quarters. Then less and less excitement until I completed the game in about 3 hours feeling like I wasted time and money. I am fond of short games like Dear Ester, or To the Moon as long as they are thoughtful, rich and interesting. Corpse of Discovery isn't anything like that, however.\n\nThe dialog is very contrived, cliche, and forced, nearly to the point of being irritating. Whoever wrote the dialog in this game I am pretty sure knew this because the game even teases you about its own repetitiveness. It almost feels like the game has gotten bored of itself.\n\nThe gameplay mechanics consist of running and long jumping to points on the display. There are some floaty wrath creature things that do nothing but interfere with the running to the objective. On one level there is a radiation that drains your radiation bar if you're exposed in the sun too long.\n\nI'm going to end this review half ♥♥♥♥♥ and lazy just like this game's ending.

I got this for two dollars, and having played it I think it's a fair price for at least five.\n\nMy favorite part of this game is just the exploration, travelling through unknown planets that look awesome yet have very real dangers. It was super immersive......that is when it worked. I had a handful of frustrating moments when I would clip through the floor to my death or get caught in a graphics hole. When I play these games though I understand how difficult it is for a small team to program a 3D game like this, and that you just have to accept glitches like that.\n\nThe story was interesting enough to keep me going to find out what happens nexts but it was just underwhelming. The game beats you over the the head with the "REMEMBER YOUR FAMILY!?!?!" shtick in a very ham-fisted fashion. The voice acting from all the family members was poor and unbelievable. Also I'm ninety percent sure that the plot of this game was doing that " I'm purposely vague and abstract so I can pretend I'm being profound and meaningful" sort of thing. I realized halfway that all these weird plot points I was finding were just pointless BS, and it was pretty disappointing. Was the astronaut dead the whole time? Was he picked up and died in a hospital later? Was he just stranded on the planet? Is this all just a dream or a coma fantasy? Who knows, I don't even think the devs did tbh.\n\nA.V.A., your robot companion, was a fantastic character though. Watching her slowly change over each sequence was really awesome. Her dialogue, while not really having a point a lot of the time, was meaninful in characterizing her as a sentient being going through an existential crisis.\n\nSo if you like jumping around weird abstract planets in low gravity with  jetpack, you should buy this game. Just don't go into it expecting a deep plot or any sort of clarification or closure on what's going on.","December 13, 2015","true","4.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Also the mouse kept randomly changing sensitivity, I generally play 30cm/360 but sometimes after a load or objective change my sensitivity would go up to 5cm/360 oe any random number between which was very frustrating.

It starts off with quite a story and as you progress through the game you never really know what is going on, very atmospheric experience.  I will try to keep this review short and sweet.  The game has an interesting story, along with some humor and emotional feelings.  The level design is open world for each planet and can be confusing to find where you need to go, but throughout the game I only came across a few areas that annoyed me..mostly towards the end of the game.\n\nThe controls are very basic, wasd,shift,space,and mouse..you can also use a controller.  I will say the flying/platforming was tedious at times and that would almost lead me to "not recommend" this game.  However, after playing through it, I decided it was good enough to get a recommended rating from me, of course this game is very slow paced as it is a walking simulator.  So, if you are into casual gameplay you may enjoy this, however if you want fast paced craziness this game is not for you.\n\nI streamed my entire playthrough of the game, so if you are interested in seeing a bit more of the game to help you decide to purchase or not, here is the link...\n\nhttps://youtu.be/itlT5hl0MTg","April 23","true","3.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Traversing the "levels" involves jumping and gliding through and around obstacles, and at times avoiding dangers. The difficulty increases: indeed, the final levels are not trivial at all. There are also a few simple environmental puzzles, in which it's not immediately obvious how to get to where you're supposed to go. For the most part it's soothing exploration of beautiful terrain. Unfortunately, the levels are procedurally generated and the challenges frustratingly repetitive.\n\nI think the game is ultimately very rewarding in terms of story and concept, and well worth playing to the end, but I can understand how some people would find the repetitive 3D platforming to be boring. I give the game a thumbs up, but would also recommend that the devs invest in careful level design and pacing in their future games. It's a shame seeing such a great concept being muddied by mediocre gameplay.\n\nAfter playing the game, you can read my theory about the story here.

The game intially grabs the player quite well thanks to its Groundhog's Day/All You Need is Kill vibe that it starts out with, and its rather depressing narrative keeps the player at least somewhat interested as to what exactly is going on with the player character.\nSadly the game lacks innovation in its own mechanics, and the narrative, although interesting, isn't really directly present until the last two sections of the game. During the time between the initial grab at the player attention and the entertaining, albeit sad conclusion, there is very little keeping the player going outside of the hope for answers. The world building present throughout the game is kept rather minimal, whether this was to keep the narrative as the focus and allow for theorizing, or just lazy game design is up to the player to decide.\nAll in all I'd have to say that the game is interesting enough for me to validate a $5 purchase (the price which I originally bought the game at), but it's best to keep in mind that there is next to no replayability unless you are some kind of theorist fanatic or have a friend sit down and play it while you look for their thoughts and reactions.\n\nTL;DR\nThe game is worth a $5 purchase for those looking for a short (approximately 3 hour) walking sim with an interesting, albeit depressing narrative, and aren't looking for games with replayability in mind.\n\nI give it a weird black creature/an entertaining AI Dialogue.","April 25","true","2.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game is somewhat pretty, with nice and responsive controls.\n\nHOWEVER, the game is ultimately (indeed, literally) a game about walking (sometimes jumping/jetpacking) to the next waypoint on relatively barren landscapes.

It's an interactive story, a narrative museum or, as the common term these days is, a "walking simulator," in that its focus is on story and creating a certain atmosphere to create a narrative experience with limited gameplay mechanics. That said, the game has a few (easy) jumping puzzles, and a few times I had to spend some time figuring out the path to my next objective. If this isn't something you like, then skip it.\n\nIf you enjoy games of this type and a sci-fi plot and alien worlds, then you may want to give this a look.\n\nGraphics/Controls/Presentation\n\nAs said, the gameplay mechanics are relatively simple. Walking, sprinting, interacting. Later on you will also make use of a jetpack. The controls were absolutely fine. I'm not a twitch gamer and I managed fine.\n\nThe game's design is very neat, with lots of detail in your little home base (most of it not interactive). The alien worlds are also each unique in their own way and offer a variety of different environments. Each planet seems very large, though I'm uncertain if there's much point to deviating from your objectives too much.\n\nThe graphics quality was good on my GTX770Ti. On planets you will find that there's many decorative objects through which you can clip, and some through which you don't - you will learn which is which. Occasionally walls glitch a bit. Unfortunately, there's a fair amount of environmental pop in and even at maximum the view distance seemed a bit short, and on a few occasions I was left wondering if a certain direction would be navigable because I couldn't see if there would be solid ground, a cliff, a ramp etc. I think I would have preferred some fog to obscure the pop in, and perhaps low res models for far off environments to make navigation easier.\n\nStory and Game Play\n\nThe game sets up an intriguing mystery within the first half hour that drew me in rather effectively and provided the motivation to continue playing. While progressing I spun several theories in my head as to where the story was leading. However, I found that by mid-game it was pretty clear, despite a few doubts in the back of my brain.\n\nMost of the gameplay has you chasing objectives on the planet surface, having to figure out how to get there and avoiding obstacles. You can die, but the consequences aren't severe. When you get a new objective, always check if there's a "secondary" in your HUD and check that one, too, to get the full story. Unfortunately, after the original WTF-factor of some of the things you encounter, some of the things you see will become a bit mundane.\n\nThe voice acting was a very nice touch, and in the last chapter I had quite a few laughs. The main character is silent except for on screen text. Some of the text disappears quickly, and sometimes it's so long it obscures a fair part of the screen. I wish there had been a different solution for this. Your little companion drone AVA is fairly fleshed out and undergoes her own little character arc.\n\nThe game is fairly introspective and in a few ways hit close to home for me. The resolution was IMHO slightly weak. I obviously don't want to spoilt it, but I was more left wondering, how the end would be presented and not what would happen. In hindsight the game functions as a parabel on ... a few topics; again no spoilers.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nI finished the game in 5 hours. As with most games in its genre there's little replay value, unless you want to see if you missed any secondary objectives. €15.- may seem a bit steep for that.

The story lays out a lot of possible threads but never follows up on most. There is also a religious versus scientific thread that comes off as more lecture than debate, as if it was included just to expound on the writer's views. Side objectives are meant to expand on the story but most give you information already heard through the messages from home. No steam achievements makes finding them completely not worth the effort.\n\nYour (voiced) companion AI and the music were easily the best part of this game, both are fantastic and make the journey worth taking. Another great addition was the gradual platforming that found it's way into the gameplay, making it less of a 'walking simulator' and more of an actual game. The jetpack physics are well designed and an enjoyable way to get around.\n\nWith such a strong start, I was hoping for a really great ending or a good twist. Something like Moon with Sam Rockwell or Oblivion with Tom Cruise. Unfortunately, what we get is a family message and a childish lullaby. Despite requiring only 4 hours to complete (some side objectives), I felt it dragged on for the last two missions and could have been summed up sooner. Had the story been stronger, this wouldn't have been a problem.\n\nMy personal taste in storytelling is responsible for what I primarily didn't like about the game and despite that I can easily recommend it. The $15 price tag is too much for what you get here, but a sale makes it an easy buy.","October 30, 2015","true","3.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

At times it feels like it wants to be a campy sci-fi film from the 1970s, especially with how the game begins. But then it gets all serious, and then gets campy, and then it ends, and you think, "that's it?"\n\nThe gameplay is tedious and repetitive. One thing the game does have going for itself is good visual and audio design. The game is poorly optimized though. I couldn't achieve 60 FPS and I'm playing on a GTX 980; a system that can run Witcher 3 at ultra settings at a steady 60 FPS.\n\nI think the concept of the game is incredible. I love a good space mystery story.

I really wanted to give it a generous "this is a thought-provoking game" review, but frankly, the story's message got so heavy-handed near the end that it felt like a hectoring lecture.  And, frankly, it was a struggle to finish anyways due to the monumental performance bugs.\n\nAs of 9/2/2015, there's a horrific memory leak in the game (to the tune of ~100KB per second), and the Unity engine starts struggling once the process passes the 3GB memory mark.  Even the beefiest of gaming PCs drop to <15fps after ten minutes of playing the game.  The only way to actually make progress in the game without headaches is to exit and restart the game after every checkpoint... which jars you out of any immersion being offered.\n\nBut even if the performance issues weren't present, I still feel like I got beaten upside the head with the story, to the extent that I simply couldn't relate to the main character anymore.

Your landing craft is torn to pieces and your gear is scattered. Why are you here? What is your mission? How will you ever get back home to your family?\n\nCorpse of Discovery is a thought-provoking first-person planetary exploration game located on 6 unexplored planets. As the player, all you know is that to return home, you must complete the mission at-hand for the Corps of Discovery. However, with each mission completed, you’re left with unresolved questions and zero answers.\n\nThe game plays very much like a first person platformer of sorts, but as mentioned has heavy exploration elements. The developer has listed the game as a “walking simulator” whilst there is a lot more to the game, that definition is a harsh but fair one. As you journey through six planets you are required to use various tools such as the jet pack to avoid deadly obstacles and/or contend with a hazardous environment as well as avoiding the mysterious shadow wraith-like creatures that kill you on-sight.\n\nOn your first day once you wake up you’re surrounded by various items such as photos and drawings, many of the items can be interacted with and give you back story to your character or in some cases your character will also make a comment regarding the object in question. The first order of business is to see if there is a message from home, after that you can explore the various rooms before entering the “main computer” module (command centre) where you are told about your mission. From there you exit the base and are greeted by the friendly A.V.A unit who will accompany you on your mission.\n\nA.V.A gives you a quick recap on the mission as well as any relevant additional information regarding the planet and its environment. As the various objectives are completed she will record the findings usually making some kind of observation while marking the next objective for you. However whilst on your journey additional markers start to appear, which upon investigation A.V.A doesn’t seem to be able to see what you can see. You initially shrug this off as despite her intelligence she is just an AI unit.\n\nThe game is deliberately light on length and mechanics. However as mentioned earlier plays a lot like a first person platformer, it should be noted that the jet pack takes a little getting used to. That being said after a while you’ll find yourself reaching various areas and platforms that you wouldn’t have thought that you could have done. In addition, the radiation shielding is used to make the player think their way around the various different obstacles in order to not get burnt to a crisp by the solar radiation is well implemented.\n\nThe game does suffer from some pretty bad “pop in” with regards to the graphical assets, there is also some clipping though objects, The only other issues I experienced were two crashes, the first while pausing the game whilst jumping and the second was right before the end sequence, however a quick reload got me right back to where I was. The game is also let down ever so slightly by not having the main character voice acted.\n\nGraphically, the worlds are breath-taking and suitably “alien-looking”. The addition of a restricted view “as though you’re wearing an actual helmet” shows nice attention to detail.  It should also be noted that most of the objectives that the player interacts with are unusual in the way in which they are presented, however by the end of the game it (kind of) becomes clear (deliberately vague to not spoil the game). The soundtrack is full of haunting piano melodies which caused a few goose-bumps. I would like to point out that the pre-menu loading screens (ie where developer/publisher is listed) is one of the funkiest soundtracks I have heard in a long while and made me smile every time I heard it.\n\nOverall, Corpse Of Discovery is highly artistic while rather abstract in many areas, so the game itself as a whole can take a little to wrap your head around, and has a very Interstellar (the movie) feel to it. This game is a little bit special, I don’t do “titles” for my reviews but if I did it would be somewhere along the lines of “games like this are why I wanted to be a games reviewer”. I have no shame in admitting Corpse of Discovery took me through a rollercoaster of emotions from goose-bumps and shivers down my spine to full on laugh out loud moments and all way back to near tears. It should be noted that this game is designed towards a more mature audience, due to its themes. I could write forever about this game, but you really should experience it for yourself as the game truly is beautiful, but as the score indicates it may not be for everyone.\n\n7/10","October 8, 2015","true","4.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Playing in between 3-4 hours. The game, quality explodes my expectations, when first launching the game you get an eerie feeling that whatever happens  when you decide to hit the new game words, displayed on the menu. It's going to be a first person narrative story! Oh I wonder How I knew that?\n\nWhen first entering the mind of an astronaut that had just momentarily awakened. The environment around you appears to be a base of some sort. I hadn't been certain whether I was on aboard a ship,  land base maybe? upon further expectation you discover in first person objects around your bedroom that relates to the time you had spent on earth, now in control of a character who is nameless as far as I can tell? You begin to walk around the exterior, doors will separate you from other rooms. I won’t go into detail as what is in each room, but I do suggest you re observe everything you’ve already interacted with as you progress this solemn tale.\n\nThrough the story you’l find your self traversing planets with epic environments that range from a desert, flora and fauna filled, and some with life forms of all kinds yet to be named, as well discovered. I never found myself being bored once I began to explore a planet.  A little circle bot will accompany you for every planet you are on, giving you reassurance of the terrific work your performing, that few humans will ever carry the likeliness that you will one day bring back to earth. The bot itself also records data of you and the planet you are on, eventually relaying the information back to the company you work for. I don’t want to get into details for the story, I will say it’s easily the strongest trait for this particular title.\n\nPlat forming, a huge part in Corpse of Discovery, you’ll find yourself avoiding and planning routes ahead as some objectives require you to travel to high mountain areas that at first look impossible to explore till your actually at the base of the it. Your given a small jet pack like boost to help you plan your jumps accordingly. Again I don’t want to spoil anything for you, but there will be moments where your deciding how your going to go about this planet, just by looking ahead of you. I’ll argue that’s about as game play as it gets, some planets offer different resistances of gravity, allowing you to enjoy some higher jumps, which can be satisfying as you’ll notice for various reasons I can’t go into.\n\nYou find yourself accompanied by much dialog, as well many different types of “feeling” music, is the only way I can think of how to describe that right now. Some of it evokes feeling that make you feel like your an alien on another planet, horror, sadness, anger, so much is great with this sound track, if I had to complain about one factor I had noticed with my play through, that periodically the music would cut off without reason destroying some of the immersion I had settled in myself at that point. Now that im on that topic, you as a player of discovery, will notice some glitches. I found nothing game breaking, but they are there, I hope you don’t find anything, but be forewarned!\n\nI wish I had more to say, but really you should just buy this game, it’s slow, plays with your emotions, and delivers a fantastic ending that will spin your head around for the next couple of hours. I hope these dev’s keep up the quality they delivered in this walking, jumping discovery game, which I always recommend to people around me. I paid $1.50 for this on a sale it had, but I would gladly fork over another $10.00.  Good day!","December 26, 2015","true","3.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Except for the finding out what the hell happens there, there's only one typical activity: wandering through various terrains trying not to be causght by the huge radioactive alien thing. Absolute lack of scary moments (the screen just fades to black when things get really fubar).\n\nFrom what I've figured as early as 2nd chapter start, it is quite clear that main character have met his death by some sort of alien terraforming machine. However the explanation for 'divine resurrection' is postponed till the 6th chapter. The 7th one is an epilogue of a sort, due to all mysteries revealed before.\n\nIs it worth it? As a walking-jumping simulator, maybe. Does it raise any serious moral questions? Well, there are some tiny moments regarding the Creation and Expulsion stories, but nothing that would ignite some serious philosophical activity.\nOverall, it tends to be pretty-looking mediocrity of a game.","August 26, 2015","true","4.9"," 6 of 18 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","6","18","0","0"

You can’t return home to your family till you complete this mission. Your only companion is a Mobile AI that aids you in your mission. From the start your mission is in trouble. Your shuttle crashes and you’re injured. You awake in your sleeping bunk and start piecing who you are and the status of your mission from points of interest within your vessel.

I learned once again, that you shouldn't judge a book by it's cover. This looks great and the trailer is pretty awesome, but once you play it, it's nothing like you think it is. You explore huge empty planets and there is nothing of interest around. It gets really repetitive and boring in a bit. This isn't a game where you get to explore huge worlds and do awesome stuff. No. All you do is run to spots really far away, and there is nothing good on the way either. Just some enemies at times, but you can even dodge them completely. The voice acting is nice, and the dialogue is ok. It's really really buggy though. I fell through the terrain god knows how many times. It really lacked fun and good gameplay. The story also seems a bit like a portal clone, but that's fine in my book. I don't like doing it, but I'm so getting a refund on this.  You shouldn't buy this. It's just not worth it.

The music and audio direction are both fantastic, with some pleasant surprises. The story that they are telling is worth the time to tell, and worth the time to hear.\n\nThe lasting impression I get is that the game came out too early in too poor of a state, was rightly savaged in reviews, then was patched over a couple months.

Tho the game is short I loved it and could have kept playing for days and days.","May 8","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The platforming is fun, if not particularly challenging. The environments are strange and varied enough. Some of the odd things you find along the way are amusing. Most of the voiceacting is quite good. All in all this is a decent title. I'm not blown away by it, but it held my interest pretty well for the amount of time it took to complete it.","May 15","true","3.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
