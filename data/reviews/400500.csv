The car combat is fun, but almost every part of this game is broken in some way. It's a shame really. The peices are there, they just never bothered to assemble them into a working game.\n\nHere is my in-depth review\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0UNMx9IEr8","September 20, 2015","false","2.4"," 84 of 92 people (91%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","91","84","92","14","0"

For some reason, this one has a lower retail value ($5.59 US) versus it's predecessor ($14.99) and this one is actually better.  If you are curious if you want to try out these games, this is the one to get.\n\nThe car types seem to be the same between the two games, there may be some differences but at first glance they appear to be the same, although there are new paint schemes and skins.\n\nMadOut is a combat racing game and it has fantastic physics, graphics, and handling.  My favorite part about the series is just how perfect the weapons operate.  The guns are actually rotating around on top of your car and focusing on the guy in front of you so you don't have to actually aim the whole car just to shoot someone.  They just need to be in range.  Same with rockets, it's nice to be able to focus on the racing!  As I mentioned earlier, the graphics are amazing.  Sure it's not cutting-edge stuff here, but for such a small game studio, they sure are able to push their limits.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-NMSxcaiTY\n\nWhat's the difference between this one and the old one?  MadOut Ice Storm has 80 levels,  MadOut has 56 levels.   I haven't actually played all the way through them to tell if the levels are all new or if they are the the same 56 with 24 new ones but they appear to be all new.  Looking at the level selection screen, they are at minimum in a different order, and one can only hope that there are changes to them.  I will try to see if I can do a comparison of the two games in depth.  Regardless, here we have MORE MADOUT for 1/3 of the price!!  For newcomers, you will get a much, much more value here.\n\nWhat's bad?\n\nThe UI is functional but it's not the showpiece here.  If they could create a new, 3D, or animated UI some day it would really look more professional.  But for now, it's a bit ordinary and serviceable.  Also, it would sure be nice to have a bit more on offer than just a series of races.  There's really nothing missing, but it just seems a bit odd not to have Arcade, Career, Time Trials, and so on.  Definitely come into this knowing that this game is just a whole bunch of races you need to win.  You can upgrade your car and earn money in between races, and that's the story of MadOut.","September 8, 2015","true","0.4"," 41 of 61 people (67%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","67","41","61","6","7"

It has the tedious microtransactions I'd expect from a Fee To Play game, the interface is dodgy, and the "full controller support" is barely functional.\n\nIf it weren't for the microtransactions, I'd say it's worth getting for a quid or two on sale. But with in-game purchases... no.","December 5, 2015","false","0.2"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","7","9","0","0"

It's got similarities  to Carmageddon and  Gas Guzzlers Extreme with respect to game play and graphics (though  you don't kill pedestrians as you do in Carmageddon, nor do you have   the wacky weapons you get in that game; however, price-wise its less than a quarter of the price of either of those games, i.e. £4.99 (at the moment its on  sale  at £3.99) so  most community members  can probably afford it. For this you get a decent   game  with all the usual stuff you'd expect of a  vehicular combat game, i.e. guns, mines, rockets, nitrous, health etc, loads of different rural and  town  tracks and a selection of cars, all of which are upgradable. You earn in game  cash by winning races; the lower down the field you finish, the less  money you get.  The more you get, the better you can upgrade for the next race.  It's not got Need for Speed, Flatout, Dirt or Grid like graphics; looking a little pale along side those titles,  but for  such  a price   this game is a steal.\n\nVehicle handling is decent, though nothing special; still, it  does the job.  You can  re-configure the  keyboard  mapping to your liking, for example, if you are left handed like me you'll probably want to change the steering and weapon controls around as I was initially playing the game with my arms crossed.  I've not  checked whether the game can be played with a  wheel and pedal controller yet (mines been boxed since we moved), but you can use a controller instead of  the keyboard.\n\nAnyway, if you like driving games  and like shooting rockets and  guns at other  vehicles,  get this game now before the price rise;  I guarantee you won't regret it.","September 8, 2015","true","2.9"," 27 of 49 people (55%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","55","27","49","4","1"

Either you have too many weapons (little variation among them), or you end up too much like Mario Kart. MadOut is a surprisingly decent entry from an indie developer who did not went for fancy (no hover, no crazy weapons...), but instead concentrated on the decent parts: physics (which affects handling and weapons), as well as huge variety of tracks, as it seems to have over 100 different tracks (albeit, many of them are just combinations of the assets from previous races, while others are "no shooting" races.\n\nThe handling in the game is excellent as the car behave realistically in corners, and you can even handbrake slide around corners. if you run up side of a hill you will fly... Though you probably won't have time to admire your handling as you'd be too busy dodging shots, mines, terrain, and each other.\n\nThere are only three weapons: mines, machine gun (auto-aimming) and seeking missiles (they don't turn that well though). Your fourth button is nitro boost.\n\nYour opponents, AI, are probably not that good drivers... as they slide all over the place, run into each other and you, understeer and slide to the outside (thus allowing you to cut inside), bouncing off walls... probably just like you are. And they will shoot you, and shoot you a lot.\n\nIf you are killed, you are respawn with no weapons or boost a few seconds behind. But that just means all the other guys are in front of your weapons, right?\n\nThere are a lot of variations on cars, and each have up to a dozen paint jobs. Weapons have a few variations and some upgrades cost $$$. You earn money by kills and wins, and you lose money if you got killed. The idea is to get into top three to open up the next race, and as I said, there are dozens and dozens (over 100?) races available, day or night, various terrains from icy tundras to city to desert to ruins and railyards and much more.\n\nThe game is surprisingly agile and on max graphics 1680x1050 on my rig of several years old it's running at max frame rates and works really well. My main complaint is the viewpoint is too close to one's own vehicle from behind, and on some courses you get killed X times in a row with no chance to get ahead as enemies just keep killing you again and again.\n\nDon't pay $20 for it. But $5? Sure.","September 12, 2015","true","0.6"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","3","8","0","0"
