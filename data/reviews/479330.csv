If you’re a total beginner, this isn’t the game for you: there’s no tutorial, and the documentation is very basic, so if you’ve never played Go before, please check out some of the excellent resources available on the web first.  (One excellent place to start would be Reddit at /r/baduk – Baduk being the Korean name for the game.)\n\nIf you already know how to play, then the question you should ask is, is this game for you?\n\nThe obvious thing the game offers you is the AI.  Rated up to 7d, this is the most powerful commercially available Go AI, and can challenge all but the most skilled amateurs.  Its minimum setting of 13k, on the other hand, should match up pretty well against anyone with more than a handful of games’ experience.  In addition, the game supports handicaps up to 9 stones, and based on a couple of games, it does a good job of playing handicap Go (far from universal amongst Go AIs).\n\nSo while a player of almost any skill level can get a good game from Crazy Stone, all but the strongest could do the same against any number of cheaper or free AIs available.  Given that, why would you pay such a steep price for the best AI?\nThe reason is the item at the bottom of the features list:  the Analysis Engine.  Crazy Stone allows you to review and analyze games you’ve played against the computer as well as games from the major online Go servers (anything that can export a game record in standardized format).  For each move you can see Crazy Stone’s analysis – including the top 20 moves it considered and the relative value of each.  If you’re willing to put in the time to go through it, this is almost like being able to play a teaching game any time you want, having a 7d grade your moves.\n\nFor me, the Analysis Engine is worth the entire price of admission.  I’m roughly 1k-1d strength, so I usually know most of the moves that Crazy Stones evaluates, but going through the analysis gives me tons of food for thought about the differences between them.\n\nTechnical notes:  this program can use all the CPU you can give it.  I’m running this on a fairly beefy CPU i7-5930K, 6-core 3.5Ghz – looking at the Analysis Engine, this allows it to simulate about 10,000 games per second.  Generally speaking, it seems to take around 30,000 simulations to get a good analysis for a move, so about three seconds on this machine.  I also tried it on an i7-3770K, 4-core 3.5 GHz – 7,000 games/second, and an i7-4810MQ, 4-core 2.8 GHz laptop – 6,000 games/second.  So it seems like most 4-cores would need around five seconds of analysis time per move.  Unfortunately, I don’t have any duo-cores to try out, but you can probably figure on doubling that time to ten seconds, more or less.\n","May 27","true","52.3"," 45 of 48 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","45","48","0","0"
