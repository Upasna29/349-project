The world-map movement and near-seamless switch to turn-based combat mode is satisfying without taking me out of one map or singular-world feel. The world is huge and fun to explore in a movement mode that acts like real-time, but does all the individual move-calculations behind the scenes. When in combat I can then seamlessly take control of each character, playing my turn-based combat.\n\nThe dialog and story are great, the world feels non-linear, and combat is fun. I recommend this game to anyone who wants their RPG itch scratched, but fans of almost any RPG variant may also love Avernum, especially turn-based-combat fans.","March 28, 2014","true","23.8"," 20 of 20 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","20","20","0","0"

One of the things I especially like is that you can work on quests as you desire. You're not forced to do Quest 1, then Quest 2, then Quest 3. Some quests are necessary to move forward in the game, but for most, the order you accomplish them in isn't terribly important.\n\nI'm not a gaming expert and I can't compare or contrast with currently popular games, but if you like a slower paced, relaxed game, this is a good one.","June 19, 2014","true","184.5"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zygomorphism/recommended/206020/","zygomorphism","zygomorphism","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zygomorphism/","43 products in account","I've spent hundreds of hours - maybe even thousands - playing Avernum 1, 2, and 3, and Blades. As such, it pains me to disrecommend this game. But this game is just downright unpleasant to play relative to its predecessors, and here's why: the new engine (derived at least partially from the Geneforge engine) is incredibly bad compared to the Avernum 1-3 engine.\n\nYou used to be able to do virtually everything with the keyboard; now you have to use the mouse for many actions (fire missile - can't use "F", cast spell - can't use a/b/c targeting, open chest - can't use "L", etc.) - and for whatever reason, mouse aiming is terrible, so probably a third of the time when I'm trying to cast a spell on an enemy, I instead accidentally click on my party member who's adjacent in melee.\nThe old engine's distinction between town mode and outdoors mode was brilliant, and gave the older games a beautiful sense of scale. Silvar and Duvno used to be ~10 town-widths apart; now, they're just one town-width apart. It just feels unrealistic, particularly if you've played A1.\nElevation no longer exists. All of Avernum is completely flat.\nThe action point system, borrowed from early Geneforge, in which you have to have a set number of AP at the end of your turn to perform an action, is awful. Not as bad as in Geneforge (which doesn't have discrete tiles), but still awful.\nSpeaking of Geneforge, many of the sprites are lifted straight from Geneforge. Drakes now look like GF drayks; "wyrmkin" are just artilas; crystal souls have been reskinned to look like I-forget-what from GF.\nThe reputation system was a really cool feature of previous Avernum games. It's gone now.\nThe stats screen, which already wasn't super-great back in A1-3, has been switched to the Geneforge-style stats screen, which is somehow worse. Frankly, Exile was better at this, IIRC.\nSecret passages were always a neat feature in Avernum; they're gone now. (I know some people found them irritating, but you could always just cast Far Sight if it really bothered you.)\nYou now have to enter combat mode to fight an enemy, where before you had the option of just whacking them with your lead character. This becomes annoying when dealing with weak enemies that only take 1-2 whacks to kill. But hey, at least you can just turn on auto-combat and let the AI handle it, right?\nNo, you can't, because auto-combat is gone now. This is terrible for all those fights with solitary chitrachs (believe me, you're going to be fighting a LOT of chitrachs) and bats and whatever else.\nSpecial abilities are gone. They added a nice bit of flavor to the game (especially the ones you got from character traits).\nYou can no longer "Wait" in combat. Why not? God knows.\nIt's not _all_ bad, though. Click-to-move is a good thing, particularly in places with lots of random stalagmites on the ground and so forth (though it's super-irritating when the game arbitrarily blocks you from moving "too far away"). Also, item lore isn't a thing anymore, and there's no such thing as an unidentified item anymore. That's a nice thing to have.\n\n\nIssues with the engine aside, another thing that really bugs me is that there's very little that's new here if you've played A1. A2 gave us the Vahnatai lands (including the passage from Formello, perhaps the best part of any of the Avernum games) and Empire lands; in A3, everything besides the Tower of Magi was new. A4 just feels like a crappy reskin of A1.\n\nAnd the plot isn't terribly interesting either. "Rentar-Ihrno is back AGAIN and you need to fix everything" is significantly less compelling than "you have been chosen to be the second group to explore the surface" (A3), "you must be our liaison to a hitherto-unknown species" (A2), or "you have been thrown into the underworld; do whatever you want!" (A1). That's another strike against A4 relative to A1. A4 railroads you through the plot a lot more than any of the previous games, and this is especially conspicuous when you're exploring the same maps as A1, where you had near-total freedom to do whatever you wanted.\n\n\nNonetheless, I have faith in Spiderweb Software. All of the other Spiderweb games I've played (some of Exile; Avernum 1-3 + Blades; Nethergate and N:R; and Geneforge 1-3) were at least good if not excellent - many notches above Avernum 4. I'm very optimistic that Avernum 5 will mark a return to form, and look forward to making some time to get started on it.","November 22, 2015","false","40.3"," 17 of 22 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","17","22","0","0"

This game, although graphically simple, is complex and challenging in its world building, treasure-hunting and character building. In Avernum, your stats actually make a diffrence and aren't there for show. Sometimes going up a stat point can make or break a fight, and the addition of perks and flaws to enhance characters (something more commonly seen in paper-and-pencil RPGs) is a nice touch. I bought the bundle pack during the Summer Sale, and I'm still working my way through the fourth; pleased with my purchase and even more eager to know I've got two more that follow the same trend. If you're looking for a group-based RPG with graphics that won't kill your computer and still retain its story quality, this game is it. I highly recommend it, coming from a old-school gamer who misses the days of Baldur's Gate and Ultima.","July 6, 2014","true","40.9"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

In it, you control a guild of up to four characters, which can be customized both in appearance as in abilities. Each character levels up individually, getting a few points which you can then spend in their abilities; and, as a classic RPG, there's plenty of them: from combat abilites (including things as melee combat, ranged combat, etc) to magic (two types, actually, one focused on magical attacks, and the other in buffs and debuffs) and "social" stats like luck and charisma.\n\nThe game itself is played on an isometric view, and the combat is turn-based: your characters (and the enemies) have a set of movement points, which are used to perform actions during your turn, from moving (duh) to combat and magic. As you explore the world, there's always the possibility of random encounters. Depending on where you are, and the skilll of your characters, these can go from minor annoyances to incredibly intense battles. You can go pretty much anywhere, and the game world is rather big, but you can increase the speed of the game in order to move faster. Even then, there's no fancy fast travel, although you do get a boat.\n\nThe story is quite good, given the fantasy world setting: you're in this huge underground world known as Avernum, where people exiled from the topside world learned to live, and a huge threat is beginning to show up. You start as a group of regular soldiers set in one of the furthest outposts, and you must make your way to the capital as you uncover more and more about the sinister forces at play.\n\nVery good (and long!) game, I enjoyed it a lot.

So now I'm dedicating an hour to each of these games and writing a series of One Hour Reviews. An hour isn't very long to judge a game on, so think of this as more of a first impression, and take this review in the spirit in which it's given. Be sure to read other reviews from players who have spent more time in the game.\n\nOne Hour Reviews - Game 16\nAvernum 4\nPurchase Date: 7/11/2013\n\nI've reviewed a few other of Spiderweb Software's games, and I am starting to feel like I'm writing the same review for each of them.  I can see where that would sound bad, because it implies that all of their games are very cookie-cutter.  I don't really see it like that, it's rather that all of Spiderweb's games are written as spiritual successors of the old school role playing games that you played in the 80s, particularly Ultima.\n\nSpiderweb makes a very particular kind of game, and so in that sense once you have played one, you have a pretty good idea of what you are in for with their other games as well.\n\nEverything is presented in a 2D tile based system, rendered in a top-down isometric view.  With everything in 2D, this means the camera is fixed, so there's no rotating the view, and no zooming in and out of the map.  But it also means you don't have to worry about fighting with the camera.  This simple presentation works pretty well, the only drawback is occasionally a door or wall may obscure your view and make it a little hard to distinguish targets.\n\nYou control a party of 4 characters.  In Avernum 4 you select your party at the start of the game (other games have you meeting your companions as you play).  For each party member you can select a character type (class) to play, pick some traits, and spend some skill points on an initial set of skills.  As for the look of your character you are very limited here.  The game lets you pick a race, and each race has a couple of preset character portraits (which also imply your gender).\n\nOnce you start the game, Avernum will give you the basics on moving around and equipping your characters.  Pretty much every one of Spiderweb's games starts out this way.  I continue to appreciate how accesible these games are to new players.  Often when you think of old school gaming you will associate that with extreme difficulty and usability issues.  That's never been the case with any of these games.\n\nThe sound is nothing to get excited about.  There are a few generic sounds for most actions.  Monsters that attack always sound like the same barking dog.  Even for an "old school" game, I think they could have put more time into adding some variety to the sounds.\n\nAvernum quickly introduces you to it's turn-based combat system.  Characters have a limited number of actions points to spend between moving and performing actions, such as casting a spell or attacking an enemy.  Classes have different abilities as you would expect.  Since the game is all presented in 2D, it's natural for the movement to be grid based.\n\nI started on normal difficulty, and found some of the early fights still posed some challenge.  I had my primary character get knocked out from a single blow.  So long as at least one member of your party survives, you can just run back to the city gates and your whole party will automatically be healed.  So there isn't really a death penalty to speak of, and this game definitely wouldn't be described as a roguelike.\n\nI spent the rest of my first hour of gameplay clearing out a dungeon of goblins, and slowly equipping my characters with dropped loot.  An hour is no time to get a sense of the story, but it's a safe bet that you can expect a long epic storyline, which is the norm for Spiderweb's games.\n\nI continue to enjoy these games and would recommend them for anyone who enjoys an old school experience.  In fact, you might just consider buying the entire bundle, rather than just this game.  The current complete pack from Spiderweb contains 13 games and is priced for $45.  So even at a non sale price, that comes out to just over 3 bucks a game.  Considering the amount of time you can spend in these games, it's a great bargain.","June 23, 2015","true","1.0"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Shantir/recommended/206020/","Shantir","Shantir","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Shantir/","306 products in account","Avernum is an old school isometric RPG that makes up for its graphics in its vast map and enjoyable story, which involves exploring the underground caverns where the Empire has exiled many of its people.\n\nAt first, I was annoyed by how tedious the game was: the tutorial is a long list of "click this" "click that" explanations in relation to doing simple commends. Just picking up items seems immensely burdensome to begin with. Combat is relatively boring: it's turn-based and you don't have many options. It's mostly a spamfest.\n\nHowever, the game quickly grew on me. There are plenty of things to do: exploring, questing, figuring out lore, trying to item collect/find scrolls and other items. In some ways, it's Skyrim without the fancy graphics and without as much customization (and if all of Skyrim took place in the Falmer zones).\n\nThe Avernum games are definitely not going to please everyone, and they are targeted towards people who are okay with playing a much less visually appealing, much more tedious Skyrim. I've only played Avernum 4 so far, and imagine that 5 and 6 will mostly be the same, so I don't really know if I will end up playing them. However, I bought them for a little more than 2$ for all three, and I think I've already gotten my money's worth and then some.","June 3, 2014","true","19.1"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

That game is Dungeons of Dragons, and I still cherish it to this day. I have been searching far and wide for a game to top it, but alas nothing has come up.\n\nUntil I played Avernum.

New character, attacks once a round, half way through the game, attack once a round. Haste will be your friend, buffs will be your friend, and you'll reach the point where your buffing yourself up more so than having fun playing.

I played a lot of rpg titles, from classics like Eye of the Beholder, Ultima 7 and Infinity Engine games to newest games like Skyrim, Mass Effect and Dragon Age series, and although Avernum does not have fancy graphics, I still think this series is one of the best rpgs ever.\n\nAvernum has great setting and story, great playability, decent length (about 100 hours) and many sidequests and secrets. Leveling up system is balanced and nowadays almost forgotten turn-based combat is a welcomed change from flashy action oriented battle systems. An old-school rpg which proves, that doesn't need "ultra high detailed" graphics to create an immersive atmosphere. Highly recommended.","August 5, 2015","true","100.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
