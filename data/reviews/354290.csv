There aren't any options to change the resolution so if you have a wide screen monitor, you have to play it in window mode otherwise it looks bad. There aren't a lot of different clothes/items to choose from and none of these items are permanent - even if you use real cash!\n\nOn to the gameplay:\nIf you've ever played Audition before, then you are familiar with beat rush. This game's main mode (called individual classic) is basically identical to that. Press the arrow keys and space bar at the correct moment to get "WOW"s. There are other modes like couple dance and bomb (which is like a hot potato game) but the mechanics are extremely similar to individual classic.\n\nThis game can be fun if you play with friends and other people. If you like rhythm games, it's definitely worth a download  since it's free but overall, there are better games with this genre in the market right now.\n\nIf this is your first rhythm game then I would recommend Osu!, Audition Online, Mstar Online, or Touch before playing this game.","January 16","false","9.3"," 60 of 72 people (83%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","83","60","72","4","3"

So if you want to know what the game is about but you want the extra 1gb of space this game would take on your hdd for something way better, e.g (music, a better game, porn or a folder filled with twenty thousand pictures of Kevin Spacey) then I reccommend checking it out.\n\n\nAlthough this game may interest you if you like paying money for trashy furry costumes, dancing with a bunch of preteen anime girls that are almost certainly controlled by other dudes and listening to a strangely wide variety of C- at best music (except for El Guapo). Then this most certainly is the game for you.

This game is brutal from the getgo, you end up with people who are freaking gods at it and, though I can play RockBand, Audio Surfer and Rocksmith with ease, for some weird reason I find needing to hit four keys on a keyboard within .2 seconds rather difficult.\nNot to mention there are some serious weeb actions going on in this game..\n\nThe music is nice, your standard K-pop stuff.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SamuraiVader/recommended/354290/","SamuraiVader","Samurai Vader","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SamuraiVader/","4009 products in account","LoveBeat is a free rhythm dance game made by Korean studio CrazyDiamond. I haven't originally expected to play it myself, but after I've seen that my girlfriend has got more than 70 hours played on that, I had to try it, I had to find what's so great about it.\n\nThe gameplay is nothing unexpected for the genre, as you use arrows and space key to match the beat. Though I have felt that sometime it was more like making your own beats next to a song, after all you won't mind that much as you'll just focus on the keys you have to press. You'll be most probably also focusing on the current leaderboards, because you are never dancing alone! For every song, people will join your room to compete with you.\n\nBut that doesn't mean you would have to play just something like "classic dancematch", there are other modes and from those are worth mentioning the team ones. You can unite into teams, to get shared points for matching the beats.\n\nThat isn't all, the game will motivate you to find a person that will get bound to you. You can get into a relationship with a totally unknown person! Also, there are families; MMORPG players may think of it as of guilds. All this social activity may sound boring and unoriginal, but since LoveBeat has really friendly community (don't expect people shouting at you for being a newbie), there is a quite high chance that you'll get your first kisses and relationships soon.\n\nWhile the soundtrack is considered being Korean pop, it mostly isn't the bland one you might think of. There is a good distribution among pop, electronic and dance music. Just a sad thing is, many people like to play the same songs over and over; you might get annoyed by hearing some songs often, even though the game has a big playlist.\n\nIt's a free to play game, so where's the catch? Your real money can be used to get faster experience gain (but levels aren't important there, it's not an RPG) and to get more unique costumes for your dancer. The most important thing I want to say is that all songs are available for free, so you can play through the content as you like!\n\nTo mention some flaws that you'll see, there are texts that would deserve (probably another) proofread. Also, the game feels overall old, as it's running on low resolution, and it has confusing menu options for new players (with mailbox and gift system that feels like early 2000). It just takes some time to understand all things you can do in game outside of the dance pool.\n\nConclusion:LoveBeat, for a free rhythm game, is good. It's a fine casual experience that can get enough love from anybody who doesn't hate pop music and cute anime characters.\n\n\nFor more reviews, join Samurai Vader's Point of View group and follow my curator page, I'm always happy to see feedback about my reviews.","March 9","true","1.4"," 22 of 29 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","22","29","0","0"

Seriously? It's 2016, there should at least be some modding capabilities.\n-Notes have very little contrast in them, which means you pretty much have to rely on the color of the notes alone\n-Upon entering fever mode, all notes have the same color, making charts quite a bit harder\n\nNeutral\n-In 8 key mode, diagonal note hits don't register properly, though this could just be my hardware\n-It's 2016, do games seriously still need to force the gender binary onto players?\n-Aggressively heterosexual gamemode options\n-You don't actually have to hit any of the arrow notes on the beat, you just have to hit them in the proper order during the small timeframe you're given to hit them.

It's a fine little game. Everyone is judging it rather harshly for being a little too foreign.\n\nAs a rhythm game it is actually fairly good. The important thing to know is that when it shows Left and Down in a single block it doesn't mean push them at the same time but instead in that order as half notes. The complaints about clothing not being permanent is a trivial one as you get the currency to "rent" these both by events and daily logins.. there are also clothes you can rent with the in game currency they toss at you after each match.\n\nThrow in the social aspect of playing with random strangers from all over the world (who seem to average between 12 and 20) and some of the strange game modes that let you couple up regardless of gender and dance together ending in an awkward kiss or the mode that pairs up male and female avatars to "propose" ending with each player picking one of the males or females and adding extra in game currency and becoming friends if you match up with each other.\n","January 19","true","12.4"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","8","12","0","0"

If you're looking for a game with good quality graphics, don't touch this.\n\nAre there K-Pop songs in it?\n-There might be some but no popular ones like BAP.\n\nIs it worth paying money for it?\n-Not at all. The money you spend for the game will vanish after a time period. You cannot receive permanent items. However, you can get most of the shop items with ingame received money, called "Beats".\n*EDIT: There is one item that is permanend. If you're playing with your partner, you can buy an item that makes you a Couple ingame. Price, 2300 Cash (4$)\n\nLast Words:\n-If you're into Rhythm games like Step Mania, this game might take your attention. It's worth a try.\nIf you're NOT the person that likes this genre.

This game is poor clone of a weeboo infested game called Audition. I am guilty of playing that game back when i had the mentality of a 16 year old girl. This game has poor translation, poor optimization and awful ingame settings that do little to nothing at all. However, if you are on a quest for that perfect waifu, by all means go ahead.\n\nIn all seriousness though. This game has done little to nothing on improving itself on the much older game it rips itself from. It might actually be worse for all i know. The libary of music in the game isn't that great and doesn't tread too far from it's home. The music list seems big, but then you realize each song as 2 or 3 copies of itself with varying difficulties, isntead of simply offering a difficulty option for each song. Even with the poor libary of music, gameplay could be fun as long as you are really one to enjoy music/ rhythm based games. This game however doesn't pull it off as well as you'd think, even though that's the one job it has is rhythm.\n\nSo the game itself hasn't done anything significant since 2004/2005 variations, this can be overlooked so long as you have a group of friends to play with, because lets be honest.. You won't be making good friends here. It's all about weebs and emos looking for an outlet for their confused/misunderstood feelings and urges. Oh Waifu my waifu. You are so Kawaii on the dance floor. We dance together in a couple themed match, therefore we should be couples irl. Friends here are only a temporary facade for their true motives of putting a leash on you. Guy's and girls ultimately aiming to C-block each other at every corner. Popularity based on a rank number and overly expensive clothing. You as a character are not important.\n\n-Toxic community/ nonexistent community\n-people rarely have actual conversations, let alone speak in english.\n-<average gameplay of the genre\n\nYou have to ask yourself, "Why am i here? Is it for the gameplay, or the waifu"\n\nOh ya.

It is a step above its competitors like osu and ddr online.  The compelling storyline and riveting gameplay keep me coming back every day for more.  The soundtrack is really well composed, featuring the works of beethoven, bach and bieber.  The community was another plus, as not only were they friendly there was a high quanitity of females which really helps me pick and choose one for my liking.  The only con I have for this game is its lack of exposure.  The marketing team did a poor job selling this beautiful title, as it is a one of a kind experience and truly deserves to be called game of the year 2016.

Oddly to say this game does a fair way of keeping you entertained with a few game modes. Don't let negative reviews ruin your own opinion and give it a try, and if you can get some of your friends to join you and you will have a wonderful time. This game can get somewhat repetative but the fun is still there. Even if you don't have friends, you can join random strangers via lobby and join them, aobut 90% of the people i've met on Lovebeat since are really nice and anyone can have a good time. The game originally shut down from it's previous server on 1.12.16 and is now here on steam. The game is nothing more than 1gb download, the music is really catchy and replayable, the keys are easy, and can easily play the game at your own pace from slowest to fastest. The only issue with Lovebeat is that the optimization is a bit outdated and only sticks with 1024x768 resolution and there isn't anyway to fix it for the time being, hopefully there will be some fixes and changes for that because the game has potential. There are some bugs that still need to be ironed out like crashing or disconnecting. From that being said you can also compare this game to Audition but a bit more updated on the looks, arrow coordination is different and requires good sense of rhythm to be able to follow along but isn't hard. Their music selection isn't big but am sure in the future it will have a bigger playlist in the future if it keeps up. Other than that, again don't let negative reviews stop you from trying it out, give it a try and have your own opinion, notmany will like it, some will.

The longest you can pay for is a month. There is a few permenent items it seems like but they are difficult to obtain. This game would be alot better if they cut time limited items and made most of the items avalible with beats, the free in-game currency. If I had to pick only one of those I would go with more items that cost beats because beats are easy to obtain, enough so that time limited items are not much of a pain in the butt. 6/10, would be 10/10 without stupid microtransactions all over the place.\n*Edit*\nI should probrably mention that this game claims to be a rated g game and chat is heavily cencored, however plenty of songs contain said cencored words. guys just bump up the rating.","January 14","true","39.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/erivas91/recommended/354290/","erivas91","Ehunter23","http://steamcommunity.com/id/erivas91/","133 products in account","LoveBeat, is somewhat one of those rythm games that you find on steam and it could be good or bad. Oddly to say this game does a fair way of keeping you entertained with a few game modes. Don't let negative reviews ruin your own opinion and give it a try, and if you can get some of your friends to join you and you will have a wonderful time. This game can get somewhat repetative but the fun is still there. Even if you don't have friends, you can join random strangers via lobby and join them, aobut 90% of the people i've met on Lovebeat since are really nice and anyone can have a good time. The game originally shut down from it's previous server on 1.12.16 and is now here on steam. The game is nothing more than 1gb download, the music is really catchy and replayable, the keys are easy, and can easily play the game at your own pace from slowest to fastest. The only issue with Lovebeat is that the optimization is a bit outdated and only sticks with 1024x768 resolution and there isn't anyway to fix it for the time being, hopefully there will be some fixes and changes for that because the game has potential. There are some bugs that still need to be ironed out like crashing or disconnecting. From that being said you can also compare this game to Audition but a bit more updated on the looks, arrow coordination is different and requires good sense of rhythm to be able to follow along but isn't hard. Their music selection isn't big but am sure in the future it will have a bigger playlist in the future if it keeps up. Other than that, again don't let negative reviews stop you from trying it out, give it a try and have your own opinion, notmany will like it, some will. Thank you and hope this review helps.\n\n","January 14","true","12.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

While it's fun to play and the community welcoming, The feature that brings this game down the most is microtransactions. All the cool items cost real money and none of them are permenent. The longest you can pay for is a month. There is a few permenent items it seems like but they are difficult to obtain. This game would be alot better if they cut time limited items and made most of the items avalible with beats, the free in-game currency. If I had to pick only one of those I would go with more items that cost beats because beats are easy to obtain, enough so that time limited items are not much of a pain in the butt. 6/10, would be 10/10 without stupid microtransactions all over the place.\n*Edit*\nI should probrably mention that this game claims to be a rated g game and chat is heavily cencored, however plenty of songs contain said cencored words. guys just bump up the rating.","January 14","true","39.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

You are unable to bind keys so you're stuck with what you got. It's a multiplayer game so you can just play with other players randomly or with friends. The biggest con this game has are the in-game items for your avatar which can be bought with real money and are only available for a limited number of days. This way of getting money is really stupid because the price for in-game currency/items is overpriced and with the time limit makes it seem completely pointless. A second but more minor con is the songlist, and that is because it is small and majority or some people say the entire songlist just sucks because it's made up of generic dance songs or acoustic songs that are in Korean, Spanish, and English I believe. Also the graphics can be a con for some because just look at the screenshots/trailer and tell me if it looks like a 2015 game; looks more like a game from 2005. This can be good for some people since it'll be able to run on anything. The animations are smooth but can look iffy and one thing I dislike is that the animation for the models when dancing don't go along with the song and that can also be said for the actual gameplay itself with the arrow keys etc. Overall if you can look past the cons, mostly the in-game items, songs, and graphics then I would recommend it especially since it's free and takes a few minutes to download and install. About a 6/10 for me. BTW my user is LoveMeat on this game.","January 19","true","183.2"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","4","8","2","1"

It is a step above its competitors like osu and ddr online.  The compelling storyline and riveting gameplay keep me coming back every day for more.  The soundtrack is really well composed, featuring the works of beethoven, bach and bieber.  The community was another plus, as not only were they friendly there was a high quanitity of females which really helps me pick and choose one for my liking.  The only con I have for this game is its lack of exposure.  The marketing team did a poor job selling this beautiful title, as it is a one of a kind experience and truly deserves to be called game of the year 2016.  Fantastic design, great community and explosive gameplay allow me to easily rate this gorgeous game a solid 5/7 perfect score.

The interaction menu when you lobby up with someone is cool but some of the songs are too difficult, even for 3 stars.

My friend and had a laugh with the emotes and the quite feminine dancing, but it would have been better if the same song wouldn't repeat as we played the same difficulty level. The walking in the lobby is clunky and unresponsive making moving difficult. The music isn't great, but it isn't bad. The main gameplay is difficult to say the least. You have to practice several times at least to get the average beat. Some levels are impossible however, such as 10 star, which I don't believe is meant to be finished.\n\nOverall I would rate this game 6/10 as it is, but dancing enthusiasts may rate it higher.

But after 15 hours of testing I consider it. The tips while waiting are really detailed and helpful, for example "Spacebar timing is key" I don't like how people start spamming question marks at me, it's very strange and needs to be fixed. I also like how you have the ability to harass members of your group with emotions like blowing kisses, begging for money and dressing up like the hulk for PAX. The game is extremely fun to play hard songs and destroy your keyboard and get hit and kicked by your parents for ruining the laptop you're supposed to be using for studying but are actually using to play korean dancing games. Although there are so many upsides, I didn't like how the men in this game were too feminine and it brings me to the question of "Has the creator of this game never looked at a single page of an anatomy book?" Sorry for being rude but I really think there's pretty much only two options for girls in this game rather than girls and boys(As well as that there's still no boobs at all).

(basic of society).\nTo just be in a group and feeling ok you'd need items or some VIP bullcrap\n\nGame was OK but had too much flaws for me.\nGj making a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t game for hardcore korean lolz chinese ppl would love it.\n\n+_/\n\nAnd the spacebar thing would be only like the fever meter but if you had only some use of it in some matchs, meaning each match you have 3. What you do with those 3 is that you can use them or not to make points go up a little not 1000x at a time... so the only point of this game would be following orders of arrows and doing spacebar when you want.\n\nBut The Point of an arrow game at first is doing, Good | Bad | Perfect and just doing the arrows keys exactly when you need to. Not alot of arrow in some spare time or of a matter of seconds..  without getting any reference on what timing is its only to make you feel better. So this game is overall cheap.\n\nYou are just trying to sincronize your rhythm and to not be free at best.\ni rate-\n\n+the mix up of keys is really poor >.< most likely. Are the keys and some bs tactics that you cannot counter or do in the other way around. So it is linear only 1 way based no skills to make you use both ways <> like this or anything else.\nReally poor game.\n\nImma go play ********** ****** *** and ** cya. nerds\nDang games are so ♥♥♥♥ poor.

The gameplay involves using your keyboard- up, down, left, and right arrow keys as well as spacebar- to make your character dance. There's a COUPLE /marriage system as well as a FAM system (think GUILD for you other mmo players) The game is new to Steam, having only arrived in JANUARY 2016 so expect updates. There is a fashion mall, in which you can use in-game currency or real $ that you would charge on your Love Beat account, where you can purchase clothes and accessories to adorn your avatar in stylish and unique apparel. If you have played Audition Online (also available for download off the Steam store) you will be familiar with the game mechanics- how to create rooms and navigate through the game world. The "dancing" and modes of gameplay are also similar, but by no means the same.

The gameplay involves using your keyboard- up, down, left, and right arrow keys as well as spacebar- to make your character dance. There's a COUPLE /marriage system as well as a FAM system (think GUILD for you other mmo players) The game is new to Steam, having only arrived in JANUARY 2016 so expect updates. There is a fashion mall, in which you can use in-game currency or real $ that you would charge on your Love Beat account, where you can purchase clothes and accessories to adorn your avatar in stylish and unique apparel. If you have played Audition Online (also available for download off the Steam store) you will be familiar with the game mechanics- how to create rooms and navigate through the game world. The "dancing" and modes of gameplay are also similar, but by no means the same. If you enjoy CASUAL GAMING and chatting, I'm sure you'll love LOVE BEAT\n\n💕","February 4","true","20.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

I then used a few easy steps which can be useful in many cases\nIn this case I used the popular Alt+tab and then I proceeded to turn off my computer.\nBy the way, the guy in the picture of LoveBeat is wearing a fedora.\nDont do this to yourself, dont play this game unless you have a pretty decent sized mullet, wears fedora everyday (not just in the weekends) and if you love anime more than your own body. You have to love it so much that it takes over your human mind and self consciousness, then you deserve to play this game,\nidk what im typing animore, got it anymore is similar to anime, ok im done, dasflsa\nhave fun","January 13","false","0.5"," 7 of 16 people (44%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","44","7","16","2","0"

I like it. In a weird way it was actually quite enjoyable to play. the songs are very catchy and the controls are pretty simple use the basic 4 key setup(really5) up, down, left, roght, spacebar. OR you cna change it up and do the 8 key setup; numpads: 1-9(5= spacebar, 1,3,7,9 are diagnal arrows). it is a very social fun game idk what else to say hoenstly.... only downside is the shop items but its a free game and it has to make money somehow and htey are purely cosmetic things and a few group boosts. Onlye thing I hate is the spacebar... it is hard to predict it but it makes it challengeing not that the higher difficulty settings arent hard cause they def are.\n\nHAve fun see you all ingame; Kisu Korian - FAM: BOSS","January 14","true","38.4"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","30","3","10","2","0"

It's a fun time waster and the songs are catchy.\n\nThe only things I'm disappointed about is the fact items you buy only last 1-7 days, you can't quit a song after you've started it, you can't turn off the beats it makes when you hit keys, and there is NO JPop/KPop. Well, I can't find any, if you're into that. It's quite disappointing.\n\nNevertheless; I still like it. Don't be so harsh on the game.

It works like Team only its best out of 3 and it gives your FAM EXP and i imagine points towards your FAM's grade too! You can have up to 50 friends on this game too and you will make some prety fast as the community is pretty friendly here which is always a + with these type of games, not perfect though of course! :P\n\nThere is 1 or 2 downsides that don't make the game unplayable but one of them is, time limited clothing/items beats or cash, I can understand why not many people like this system, i wish we could have them for good too but the game being F2P, has to make its money somehow i guess XD +getting beats in this game seems pretty fast as you get a lot of beats for leveling up which can be found in the gift boxes you get! :)\n\nThe song list is pretty nice too, not all will appeal to you as everyone have different taste but songs like "City Lights" and "In Tune" are nice ones and 2 of my faves on this game! :D All the songs are fun to try regardless as this game is all about having fun afterall\n\nYou should give this game a go and see how you get on, nothing to lose eh and you may enjoy it, i personally am so far its nice to see another game like this on Steam as i always will give them a go! :D Have fun and dance! :)","January 21","true","338.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The way it works is, when you hit a note, it grades you on how accurate to the beat the hit is. The system itself if brillient, but the way the game comprehends it bothers me. when you hit 90% or higher on a note section, it comes up in the "wow" format, but 90% does not count as "wow". The reason this bothers me is because it is misleading. It has made me think time and time again that I will get a wow, but I don't because you have to hit full 100% on each section on the note strip. All I ask is that you be more lenient of your grading. New players can't hit full 100%, most will hit 80% or more on their first time. So I ask that when you hit 90% or higher, you count it as "wow", but if you don't, at least put the 90% collor the the "cool" color, blue.","February 1","true","24.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Also cash (bought with real $) is rather expensive regarding the prices of the items in the store that are necessary for the premium items. They do have nice systems to give you free items everyday and when you level up that makes it nearly worth it. I personally like the game though, but I havent gotten to play very much of the game. I have played nearly 8 hours at this time and have only gotten to lvl 4. I suppose its good that it takes so long to level up so you can practice your skills, because the game is rather hard once you get past 130 BPM and 4+ Star levels.

The game is very Anime/manga themed, so if you like that vibe you would suggest this game to you, but on top of that the lobby for me makes it for me because its a little freeroam where you can chill talk and roleplay a little while you wait for players to join and can have continuous fun in or out of dance mode.","February 3","true","5.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The graphical user interface was very poor, and i was unable to tell where my friends list was (it was not connected to the steam friends list by the way), and joining a friends room was impossible because of the difficulty in navigating the GUI. I would not recommend this game to anybody who wants to play a decent rhythm game.","February 11","false","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The English translation is laughably bad, but there isn't much text aside from the tutorial.  The songs are okay, mostly ripoffs of recent hits.  There's a cut that's clearly jacked from LMFAO's Party Rock which is competent but nothing famous.\n\nThere's no reason to put any money into this unless you're a weirdo who wants to look like a cat in a waiting room.  Nothing against cat-waiting-room people of course.\n\nPlay it for a couple hours.  Come for the bad translation, stay for the okay music, but don't spend any money.  If you have a hole burning in your pocket go buy some Dota 2 outfits or something.  They're equally pointless but ay least someone might notice them.","January 15","false","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
