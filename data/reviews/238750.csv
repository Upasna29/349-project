I just can't recommend MIght & Magic X.\n\nI played this during the beta, and played through the game twice. I decided to wait to try it again until after the beta was finished. When it was released, I was onto other games and hadn't gotten around to it.\n\nThen, the Legend of Grimrock 2 came out, and I played all of the way through that, which got me nostalgic to play this one again.\n\nBut it's so bad. Particularly compared to Grimrock 2, but moreso even against it's predecessors. Even Might and Magic III, made in 1991 (23 years ago), is a better game in nearly every way.\n\nI've loved every Might & Magic game and have played through them all multiple times. This game is a shadow of those games.\n\nThey decided to move back to a tile-based system. Unlike most people, I was fine with that. It didn't bother me.\n\nWhat does bother me are the boring mechanics, limited and uninteresting character creation and development, a boring story, *cartoony* graphics, poor gameplay, bugs, typos (I counted 2 just in the narrated intro), hostile controls, lousy mapping..\n\nI really want to like this.

My advice is: be patient and wait until it is released and reviewed by RPG gaming community.\n\nFor some reason, many have been misguided, considering the game is still at alpha stage, and yet to pass through long development process. While LE studio considers otherwise, and here i will quote Thomas, LE technical lead:\n\n<LE-Thomas>	Question: will we get christmas update with more content? xD like lets say, new areas and quests?\n<LE-Thomas>	Answer: Sorry, the team is currently working on finalizing the game. There will be no more content updates to the game until the release. Until early 2014 is not a long time left anymore. ;)\nThis was stated during the third developers chat session. Obviously they will release the game in its current state. This simply adds more reason not to purchase Early Access version.\n\nAlso a HUGE WARNING NOTE.\n\nCAUTION:\n\nThis adressed to all M&M VI, VII and VIII fans. In case you're one of them, check all the information about the game twice or even thrice as meticulosly, before making a decision. This game is based on M&M IV: Clouds of Xeen & M&M V: Darkside of Xeen. It has very illusive resemblance, if any at all, with M&M games staring from Mandate of Heaven.\n\n\n\n\nThis been added at the 29th of november:\n\nOk, now i will give some general info to familiarize you with some aspects of this project, i find rather questionable and controversial. Starting with:\n\n1) Size of the game world.\n\nM&MX is told to be consisted of 4 Acts, with Act 1 available during the Early Access. Act 1 location (including both Sorpigal by the sea and Peninsula maps) feels to be half the size of, for ex., Castle Ironfist location (from M&MVI). Act 1 offers us five dungeons, those being: Spider cave in Sorpigal; Lighthouse, Bandit Hideout, Catle Portmeyor and Cursed Ruins (which is not available in the Early Access phase) scattered all over peninsula map. Also we have two caves, each holding a single Cyclop monster inside and an empty puzzle cave. The size of these dungeons are medium, and it won't be much of an exaggeration to say that Castle Darkmoor (MMVI) would be able to contain all of them within itself.\nNow, to make an approximate estimation of the overall world size, you can take a look at the "World Map" picture, where i marked the borders of the area Act 1 occupies.\n\nhttp://imagizer.imageshack.us/v2/800x600q90/24/8j6k.png\n\n\n2) Character creation and development\n\n2.1 Races.\nM&MX creators offer us 4 races to depict our party members from. Those being: human, elf, dwarf and orc. The difference between them lies in starting stats, certain level of mastery they can advance to in different skills, names of the classes for each race to choose from, appearences, and minor starting race-dependant bonus, like elf having +5 evade, +10 earth resistance from the beggining.\n\nhttp://imagizer.imageshack.us/v2/800x600q90/34/c2om.png\n\n2.2 Classes.\nOnly three classes are at our disposal to choose from for each race. Basically we are given three same classes for each race, being: warrior, archer, mage (so it goes like: Human Warrior, Human Mage, Human Archer/Elf Warrior, Elf Mage, Elf Archer, etc.). The difference between them is: how they are named, ex: Mercenary (HW) against Barbarian (OW); their promotions; level of mastery they can achieve in a certain skill and appearences.\n\nhttp://imagizer.imageshack.us/v2/640x480q90/7/tily.png\nhttp://imagizer.imageshack.us/v2/640x480q90/89/wzi5.png\nhttp://imagizer.imageshack.us/v2/640x480q90/46/5g0q.png\nhttp://imagizer.imageshack.us/v2/640x480q90/15/nkwx.png\n\n2.3 Class promotions.\nEach class has a promotion to be achieved through the game. There will be only one, against two in the later M&M games. It will give one additional ability to the character, no other bonuses are know about at the current moment.\n\nhttp://imagizer.imageshack.us/v2/800x600q90/543/81ab.png\n\n2.4 Character customization.\nAfter choosing a race and class it is time to customize character appearences. You have a wide variety of two drawn pictures for each gender (one male body/one female body), each in turn having two faces you can switch between (giving us four different portraits to sum it up).\n\nhttp://imagizer.imageshack.us/v2/800x600q90/844/vi97.png\n\n2.5 Skills.\nDevelopers have cropped all non-combat related skills like: trap find/disarm, repair, trade, identify (there will be a spell), diplomacy, perception...any other player-world interraction skill you can think of. Leaving three groups: weapon mastery skills, magic mastery skills and misc combat related skills like dual-wielding, dodge, evade, skill adding crit chance to a spell based attack, etc.\n\nhttp://imagizer.imageshack.us/v2/800x600q90/837/y8jg.png\n\n2.6 Magic.\nDevelopers decided not to implement magic system from the later M&M games, where you were able to learn every spell at basic level, and advancing in magic mastery upgraded effects of each spell differently, based on the spell itself. Now it is more standard "magic mastery of certain level requirement for each spell". You can learn certain spells at basic level, certain at expert and so on. Spell effect doesn't change while you advance in magic mastery.\n\nThe following picture will show you all Air magic school spells (basic to GM), that will be available in the game.\n\nhttp://imagizer.imageshack.us/v2/800x600q90/199/yo0c.png\n\nSpell description:\n\nhttp://imagizer.imageshack.us/v2/800x600q90/163/x8j6.png\n\nThere will be no Item Enchant spell, in case anybody is wondering.\n\n2.7 Inventory.\nWe will have combined inventory now, each item occupying one slot. Also no paper-dolls (items won't be shown on player's picture being dressed) Equiping this or that item won't alter character picture in any way.\n\nhttp://imagizer.imageshack.us/v2/800x600q90/593/n50l.png\n\n3) Character/world interaction.\nDue to absence of non-combat related skills, player gaming experience is limited mostly to combat, opening objects (chests, barrels), getting buffs (one buff statue in Sorpigal, one in Peninsula). There is one quest in the first act, which implies on giving the freedom of choice to a player (you can kill or let go bandit leader), other than this, there are no player-choise driven situations.\n\n4) Combat.\nThis is what it is all about. Judging from absence of non-combat related skills, lack of player-world interaction besides engaging your enemies, and answers from developers themselves, LE are trying to create combat oriented game (tile- and turnbased gameplay fits this concept idealy). Unfortunately they are not succeeding here either. Combat is rather standard and despite the looks of it, doesn't provide you with enough tactical depth you would anticipate. Poor variety of character classes, lack of significant race dependant perks/abilities, standard skill set, absence of really valuable effects of tactical (not damage dealing) spells, ect. make the game unable to offer reach and thrilling combat experience. Not to go deep: you cann't aim anything in case it is not standing in the adjacent tile.\nThis meaning: if you have two or more opponents approaching you, apart in two or three tiles, you won't be able to target specific one to use a spell on or attack from distance (with an arrow, for ex.). Those attacks will be delivered randomly (or you may use area damage spell) to any enemy standing in the same tile.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/blerbler/recommended/238750/","blerbler","profffile2","http://steamcommunity.com/id/blerbler/","92 products in account","As someone who bought MM-1 off the shelf way back in the day, and have played every game in the series other than 9, the mixed reviews made me hesitant to jump in.  But picking up the deluxe version (includes MM6) on sale I jumped in, and have been pleasantly surprised.\n\nReading other reviews, I can relate to a lot of the pros/cons cited, but for me things other people found as cons (combat, grid movement) were very much pros for me.  I think what this game does well, it does very well, but it may not be to everyone's taste.\n\nMMX strips out a number of features that existed in 6-8 in particular, but ultimately that makes MMX much more of a tactical game than its predecessors. In those games in most environments you could easily exploit the strength of ranged combat and the opportunity to toggle in/out of turn-based combat to kite. I may have, at times, even exploited running out of dungeons to avoid a fight or having to reload in those earlier MM games - that doesn't work here.\n\nKiting in this game is only at all possible with certain class combinations, and the 'ambush' nature of many encounters and the inability to move with an enemy already in melee range make that impossible. MMX will require you to rest, and use potions, and buff/debuff. If you open a door in a dungeon without saving or resting first,  you'll probably regret it.  And AFAIK you can't leave an area while in combat to exploit out of the fight.\n\nAs for character creation, I'd agree that the options for any individual character are not deep (which may hamper your RP enjoyment), but party selection itself is imo a moderately complex tactical game. The variety of options for party composition are deep.  12 classes and 4 races to choose from, and you're almost certain to have to forgo something you really want in your party (whether a race, or a buff, or dps combos).\n\nPuzzles are pretty good on the whole, story is meh (but personally I don't think plot has ever been high on the list of reasons to play MM), and the skill system is true to its predecessors while offering a variety of small tweaks/improvements.\n\nAs for being one-shot, that can happen, and generally for 2 reasons: 1) you wandered into an area too high for your party level, or 2) you really needed to get your buffs on.\n\nIf you aren't completely turned off by the notion of a turn-based, tactical RPG where there's more focus on the complexity of party creation and skill progress, for me that has been a real steal, and makes me very willing to consider paying full price if they release a follow up.  Will you have to save/reload a lot even on normal difficulty? Yes, but for me that's been part of the charm - progression in this game feels like an actual achievement.\n\nEdit - wrote the initial review at the end of Act 2, roughly lvl 20. On "normal" difficulty, this is around the point where the difficulty level swings quite a bit, since you start to GM in skills and have access to the gold and trainers needed to do it.  But all in all, I definitely enjoyed it, and after moving through some other games in my backed-up library, will consider playing again on heroic difficulty.","January 12, 2015","true","71.8"," 105 of 125 people (84%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","84","105","125","2","0"

When I saw this title here on Steam I was positively suprised and immediately bought it in rememberance of the good old times.\n\nUnfortunately I'm quite dissaspointed with it though. Graphics is ok, but gameplay is horrible. The characters frequently issue warning shouts, even though there is nothing to see. What is really annyoing though is, that you can easily get locked into a fight where you don't even want to, because the party has to rest. But you can't walk away, so the only thing left to do is to reload. This also includes getting into a dungeon where you realize that the enemy is to tough, but you can't back out anymore, because you are not allowed to leave the dungeon and flee until the fight is over.\n\nI don't know if I missremeber MM in the wrong way, but I don't recall having such issues in the original series.\n\nAnother total annoying thing is that you have to register with UPlay. I can't even play offline when I don't have internet. WHY????? I specifically purchase such games to take them with me on my laptop to summer vacation, where I often don't have internet, and this is really annoying for no apparent reason!\n","October 31, 2014","false","7.9"," 258 of 355 people (73%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","73","258","355","3","2"

It deserves to get more positive reviews.\n\nThe combat of this game is considerably tactical, as compared to recent RPG games including recent old school type ones.  Depending on enemy's attributes, you need to carefully choose which skill you gonna use to attack it or to make your characters survive. Sometimes your magic does not work for enemies. So it is important to check the magic resistance of your enemy in a journal.\n\nThe game asks careful character progression. You can not increase all of your skills up to grandmaster. Also, your game play would be very easy depending on which skill you learn or increase. So you need to make a plan for your character. This is a pleasure in a RPG game, not a pain.\n\nThe game gives you chances to solve many puzzles and riddles. Most of them are easy, but some are difficult. However, when you solve them by yourself, it will give you a great fun.\n\nBased on the points above, I highly recommend this game to someone who likes turn-based, party-based, or old school RPG.

I never meant to compare this title to the old series coz I didnt care to do so to begin with!\n\nFor me it's old school rpg coz its a 4 party, turn-based, 1st-person game.\n\nTotally different from what EA gave us and REALLY fun to play...for me its the opposite of Skyrim and I think the devs did excellent job to bring something that goes the opposite direction from today's mainstream rpgs.\n\nIn my opinion: Well-balanced, tough fights on warrior-mode, open world-meaning that there are some enemies that you have to comeback even in Act 1 in order to fight 'em after you beefed up in levels, better AI and monster behavior, better skill/magic/buff system, smooth heroes/enemy movement and so on.\n\nYes, they could have added some extras to make it really great game, but I think it's an awesome start. I understand that there are ppl who are disappointed coz they expected something else along the lines of an exact copy of an older MM game with modern engine/graphics...BUT I'M EXTREMELLY HAPPY the way this game is AS IT IS!!!\n\nHope next one in line is a monster...good battles to all the brothers who are enjoying MMX.\n\n\n\n\n\nOLD REVIEW: Loved it even with its early access faults...when they balance enough aspects of the game, it will be really great fun to play.\n\nNot for people who expect a game like Skyrim, its for old school rpg fans with the benefit of auto-mapping...just wish they'd put more riddles along the way and maybe more quests affecting the outcome of the main story or the characters.\n\nSure the devs wont follow on all the great suggestions from the community but still it will be worth playing and enjoy yourself if the content of the final release is big enough.\n\nTo expect the perfect game on all aspects/parts of a game and on top of that to have the devs please all different kind of rpg fans is useless...READ the reviews and then DECIDE if that's the game you want to play or not...the game is a tile-based/turn-based and they should improve the parts of the game based on that idea...dont mind if they had the option for free movement but it shouldnt be a pre-requirement to play an rpg-game like this...there are tons of other rpg games for that.","December 13, 2013","true","486.2"," 300 of 450 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","300","450","0","2"

The game has been reported "dead" by the publisher. No more DLCs or bugfixes will be provided.\nWhile the game runs okay for most players, it unfortunately has been left with some serious unfixed problems on some system configurations that range from overheating on laptops, freezes on Macs, and annoying stuttering on some NVIDIA cards that may render the game almost unplayable, to (in rare cases) crashes to desktop. Be warned that customer service will probably not provide you with much more than "have you tried turning it off and on again" in case you are affected by any of the above mentioned bugs. Purchase at your own risk!\n\nIf you loved the M&M 1-5 games (and have a graphic card that can handle it), you may actually enjoy the game just for the fan-factor. It may not be the expected "big sequel" but it is solid and entertaining.\nIf you are new to M&M however, or you have just played "Heroes of Might and Magic" so far, this game may disappoint you.\nAlso if you are looking for a "Legend of Grimrock"-like RPG, be warned that this game has a very different feel to it. While the game-mechanics are similar, the gameplay actually feels a lot more static and not as action-oriented.\n\n1. The game itself\n\nM&M 10 is playing after the story of Heroes of Might and Magic 6. The gameplay and "feel" of the game however is mostly based on Might and Magic 3-5.\n\nThe game is a "stepper" with turn-based combat. This means you move through the world 1 step at a time and there is no free movement. If you encounter an opponent the game stops and switches to a turn-based combat mode. You then give your party members commands to attack, defend or use magical powers. Once you have done that the round switches to your enemies who will do the same until either you or your opponent drops dead, whatever comes first.\n\nSince the gameplay is based on M&M 3-5 fans of the series will find some nostalgic elements, like barrels containing liquid that buffs your attributes, riddle chests and the like.\n\nThe story is solid but unfortunately also pretty generic. (I won't spoil it here though, so that you can still experience the fun yourself)\n\nThe map is unfortunately -again- rather generic. Where M&M 1-5 featured treetop houses, cities in the sky and even space-ships, all you got in M&M10 is pretty standard villages. Not even your run-off-the-mill castle. A little more fantasy wouldn't have hurt the game here.\n\nThe size of the map is not large but "medium". So where the description says "3 towns, 1 city, 20 dungeons" it literally means just that. Except that they don't mention that some of the "dungeons" literally have just 1 room.\n\nGraphics quality is ... not good. The game looks like it was more or less pieced together by using whatever texture or model was laying around at that time. Thus some objects are very nice and detailed, but the majority unfortunately looks blurry and washed out even on "ultra" settings.\n\nThe sound quality is acceptable. However the soundtrack is quite generic and not very memorable.\n\nIn total the game is fun with enough solid gameplay to keep you occupied for like a week.\n\n2. The downsides\n\nThe game was produced on a tight budget by Limbic Entertainment. A small studio that has no experience whatsoever with AAA-class games. They clearly state on their website that their field of expertise are "social and flash games". The name as their greatest success so far: "Mein Ponyhof 2", a horse-barn simulation for little girls.\n\nThey also stated in their blog that M&M10 was a "test" for Ubisoft to see wether or not people would still spend money on the series.\n\nI'm actually very sorry to say that but all of the above and especially the tight budget actually shines through. And unfortunately not just in the fact that all horses in the game have beautiful textures.\n\nAlso it has to be mentioned that the game requires a UPlay account and installation of the UPlay client on top of Steam. If having to create yet another account with yet another company just to play the game is a big "no-no" to you: I recommend you stay away.\n\n3. Not included in the game:\n\nDespite what the store page tells you this game does NOT include a free modding editor. The "modding kit" is actually just a resource pack for Unity Pro, that requires you to purchase the Unity Pro editor which is NOT included in this package and costs about 1500 USD.\n\n4. For "digital deluxe" purchase\n\nThis version contains an additional dungeon and a mini-campaign. The dungeon is just standard.\nThe reactions on the DLC have been mixed. Most people some to find it "solid" at best. I would suggest you expect to get some "solid" extra hours of "acceptable" gameplay that may be quite enjoyable but will be nothing to tell you grandchildren about.\n\nNote however, that the DLC has been reported to break the option to run the UPlay client in offline mode, so that you need to be always online in order to play it. If you can't be "always on" for whatever reason, I recommend to stay away from the "digital deluxe" version.\n\nThe "digital soundtrack" is 30 minutes of unmodified in-game music encoded as 128KBit joint-stereo MP3. Despite what the store-page tells you, you are NOT getting the "official soundtrack on audio CD".\nThe files don't show up in your Steam library. You find them in your installation folder. The music quality is okay, but nothing really memorable.\n\nNote that there is another dungeon and some minor extras as well, that can be unlocked by earning virtual currency through getting achievements. However, I experienced that the achievements don't unlock properly and thus I have been unable to access any of that.\n\n4. Limitations\n\n- The 32-Bit version of the game is limited to medium texture quality and voice-over is deactivated.","December 11, 2013","false","10.2"," 547 of 839 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","547","839","0","19"

Some notable skills have disappeared as well; as there is no Alchemy, Identify Item, Learning, Merchant or Repair Item skill, as well as a few other examples.\n- Gameplay-wise it has some important changes from previous M&Ms. You follow a tile-style map when moving around! For those familiar with pen and paper Role Playing games such as Dungeons & Dragons, think of it as the 5x5 hex-grid system (which the M&M X map looks like).\n- Combat is more strictly turn-based. This means a monster will have to wait for its turn before attacking you (or you it), as each of your characters in turn takes their actions. Explained more thoroughly in my personal opinion.\n- The Night/Day cycle is much quicker, especially outside of towns.\n- Levelling up skills and attributes and what improvements it will grant you is 'tooltiped' by mouse-over, and the different character panels are somewhat easier to use.\n\nMY PERSONAL OPINION\nThe game looks good. It has that M&M feeling to it, in a modern sense where lighting effects and shades are more modern than in older versions, yet it's not meant to look "outright realistic", and both NPCs and world objects look the way they 'always have' in the series.\n\nThe new and more strict turn-based system of combat also has its advances, in that you can take your time to plan your next and most optimal move with each character. It also means you can plan ahead of the monster's next attack, and since you can rearrange the order of your character's easily, you can put your heavy cannons to go first, after which, depending on whether they dealt enough damage or finished something off, your supporters can cast the appropriate buffs before the next turn begins.\n\nThen again, nothing prevented you from pausing the game to think ahead in previous versions, just saying.. Yes, the stricter turn-based system can sometimes slow the gameplay down. You can still hold down a button to have all your characters repeatedly fire their arrows at whatever you're fighting, but you cannot move while doing so. Even if you didn't have to move, if three of your characters are just firing arrows away with their mana emptied, but the fourth being the one doing something different, you will have to stop and click a different number (taskbar being the traditional 1-9) for that particular character.\n\nPersonally, I like the old style where you manually set a spell and a non-spell attack and just blasted away, even if that is a less cost-efficient approach. Back then everything happened simultaneously as well, both your attacks and the monsters', each with their own cooldowns. I have yet to notice my characters using anything powerful enough to make them "lose their next turn due to recharging", or anything similar.\n\nBecause of the tile-style movement, you are less likely of getting lost, you wont get stuck in the environment, and it's easier to figure out where to go in some cases. It does limit your movement somewhat, though, and calling this "an exciting open world" is a stretch. Yes, you can SEE the world, but the tiles will tell you where you can and cannot go. In other words, forget scaling up those hills in an angle to skip some travelling, or nudging your way down a tall mountain to get to the bottom quicker. No tile = not an option! (I wonder if a Fly spell exists in this game)\n\nThe plus side of the tile system is that travelling between key points takes (much) less time than before, and it certainly is a game focused around combat and action, rather than sightseeing and flower-picking (..fond memories of my alchemist scaling the M&M7 mountains to pick those rare flowers for potions.. anyway.)\n\nWhen in combat, the tile-system to me is less enjoyable than the good old free movement. You are LOCKED in combat. I.e. if you want to move somewhere, you have to wait for your turn. You can move one tile, then whatever you are fighting will either attack, or move after you, and then you can move again. This means no party kiting and killing that tough giant with their crude bows.\n\nCONCLUSION\nOverall the game to me falls into the pitfall of so many other games these days. It's a good and tried-and-true model that instead of being kept that way is slimmed down to make for faster, easier (to me in most cases less enjoyable) gameplay. Instead of feeling like a mighty hero who comes up with clever schemes to defeat your mighty adversaries, I feel like I'm being stripped of some of my powers and choices by the game simply telling me "sorry, we can not let you do that".  No crafting potions? No repairing my own items?\n\nFinding your way because of the tile-system is nice at times, but it also strips me of going exactly where I want to go. Yes, you can most times choose option a, b or c to do first, but even if you choose c, you usually have to come back and do a and b in any order after before moving on to d.\nFor example, in M&M 7 you could pretty much walk to the tougher zones in the game as soon as you got off the starting island, and although you pretty much couldn't kill anything there (crude bows kiting comes to mind along with a heartful chuckle, though), you could still try to roam around for chests, pick those before mentioned flowers, followed by running for your life to leave the place as you just noticed one of the giants had gotten on your trail.\n\nI want to like M&M X more than I do (that said I do enjoy it, albeit mostly for nostalgic reasons). On the plus-side the nostalgia from playing an M&M game made me want to revisit M&M 7 again, a game which I can also play while I'm offline, or while the rest of the world is offline too, for that matter. As long as my computer has power at least.\n\nIf you're a hardcore M&M fan, I would still recommend picking it up for the nostalgia. It's not a "bad game", despite giving it some harsh critique, it's just a well-made game that doesn't appeal to me in the old-fashioned M&M way, with a few too many things changed or altered (the combat + tile-style being my main drawbacks here. Adding that I am well-aware this was never meant to be a "typical M&M clone"!) The fact M&M is one of my all-time favourite series also means I set the bar quite high, if it sounds like most of the review is negatively charged.\n\n\nSo..  Would I recommend this game? The short answer is, it depends who is asking.\nTo a seasoned M&M player; yes, but to someone not familiar with the M&M series; probably not, as the gameplay is rather outdated.\n\nIf you know very little about the M&M series, but like old-style type of games, I'd recommend passing on this one, and instead picking up Might&Magic VII: For Blood and Honor from GOG (for only 6$!), and, baring in mind old graphics are what they are, you will have a more fleshed out game with a lot more depth to it than this one.\n\nHowever, if you're only in it for the turn-based combat that M&M X focuses on, pass - there are better and more modern turn-based games out there today. :)\n\n..Then again, it could be I'm just a masochistic hero who enjoys the pain and suffering of spending twice as much time on travelling from point a to point b, only to realise I went into the wrong cave and suddenly faced monsters ten times my level...\n\n- Xeni","January 24, 2014","false","54.1"," 124 of 183 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","124","183","0","11"

It's expansive, challenging but not unfair, and there's a good amount of character and party customization.  It's the most RPG-y RPG I've played in a long time.\n\nYou'll travel the open world, come across riddles, puzzles, enemies and dungeons - some of which will be too high level for you.   There is no level scaling and the world is crafted in a way that you're going to want to backtrack often to try and kill that boss you found who one shot you 10 hours earlier.  And that's awesome.  You're going to be battling your way through dungeons, barely surviving by the skin of your teeth and have to make runs back to town (actual runs, no instant click travel here) to restock on supplies so that you can continue.  And that's awesome.\n\nIt's not going to be for everyone but this is a really solid, lengthy and replayable RPG with lots of substance that's built on its RPG systems and its gameplay rather than a story or dialogue choices or any of the usual modern stuff.\n\nThe only con is performance.  Performance is poor in some places, and loading times especially are poor.  This is exacerbated by the fact that the game freezes in the background, meaning you have to sit through the 30 second-1 minute load screens.  This can get very annoying because you will often be making trips back and forth to town and there's a loading screen each time.  The game also doesn't exactly look amazing and the dialogue and story are generic and half-♥♥♥♥♥.  But from what I understand this is a game made by a small team mostly as a proof of concept to get this series back up and running, and it did what it set out to achieve and then some.","January 31, 2014","true","62.8"," 45 of 58 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","45","58","0","0"

But if you do not like these two basic features of the game (or even just one of them), you really should keep away. You've been warned.\n\n"Legacy" harkens back to the Might & Magic games of old - and with this I don't mean Might & Magic 6/7, but rather M&M 3 "Isles of Terra" and M&M 4/5 "World of Xeen". You can still buy those from GoG, but the once stunning VGA graphics are real hard to endure nowadays, so it's a blessing that Might & Magic X exists. While the graphics here aren't exactly top notch, they are still very beautiful and atmospheric. (Almost) everything else is like it was in those old games: A deep turnbased combat system at its core, a big upper world to roam freely with your party of four (plus two hirelings), towns, dungeons, inns, merchants, quests, riddles - the whole shebang. In this, "Legacy" has much much more to offer than, say, "Legends of Grimrock II".\n\nGiven all the above, there are only two real downsides to the game: The first is that it is unfortunately technically unoptimized. This becomes noticeable to the user in the wide upper world, where there's sometimes hitching while you move your party a tile - even with the most advanced GPUs in town. This is strange as the game really shouldn't be very demanding at all (the only reason that could explain this is that the engine seems to rely more on your CPU power than on your GPU). This does detract from the oldschool RPG fun only slightly, however.\n\nWell, and the second downside is of course Uplay. I once swore I would never buy another Ubisoft game from steam again until they got rid of this utterly useless and annoying additional DRM-scheme, but when I broke my vow and reinstalled it  (just for this game), I noticed that it at least became much more unobtrusive compared to how I rember it from a few years ago (when I played "Farcry 3" for a while). Also retrieval of the long forgotten password for my account was no problem.\n\nIf I had to give "Might & Magic X - Legacy"  a score, it would be 8/10 for fans of grid-based RPGs with turn-based combat. I would have given 9/10 if the game were optimized. The last missing point is because I really miss some features from the old games, namely: sorcerer guilds and banks that give interest on deposited money. Also, while the story always played second fiddle in M&M games and the narrative we are presented here is ok, I liked some of the storylines of earlier installments better. A nice touch, though, is that (if you are perceptive) the great "sci-fi setting" twist of "Might & Magic 3, Isles of Terra" is at least alluded to in "Legacy" too.","December 14, 2015","true","109.9"," 29 of 35 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","29","35","0","2"

Unfortunately, Might and Magic X does not feel like a good entry in the series nor a good role-playing game. Personally I’ve never played a might and magic game (I am a huge fan of the Heroes of Might and Magic series however) so I'm coming into the series as a relatively new player. I have played one other game similar to Might and Magic X; Grimrock, which I loved and play completely through. I bought this game with similar expectations and was sorely disappointed.\n\nFirst I was expecting clever puzzles and riddles, there are none to be found in this game. Puzzles are mostly switch puzzles and riddles don't require any sort of abstract thinking, or really much brain power at all to figure it out. Okay, lame puzzles, is combat any good?\n\nNope, in Grimrock you had four characters, two in front for tanking and two in the back as range or support, in this game they stand side by side, allowing your squishy magic characters to be hit alongside your heavy characters, it makes switching character places pointless and overall it’s annoying. Range characters are also pointless, most of the games engagements take place within melee range and range characters will get a penalty when in melee range and their shots hit random enemies so if there is more than one better hope the shot hits the enemy you want; they don't have strong enough magic or melee combat skill to be worth devoting a character to range, just use melee and caster characters. All classes can use a ranged weapon in any case, a much more preferable option to having a useless character. Combat itself lack strategy and excitement, it’s much quicker to just mash the attack button through fodder enemies; bosses are the only enemies requiring more strategy, but it’s not much more and overall combat is a bore and a chore, sadly the game relies on it heavily. Side rant, the final boss fight is bogus.\n\nVisuals and audio are both pretty good, the game takes you to a great variety of locations and there is plenty of color in this game, it’s pretty. Music is standard fantasy fair, but it’s well done. Voice work is...ok, not sure why elves and dwarfs sound similar, I shake my head and chuckle anytime I hear my Scottish elf girl speak, it doesn't really fit in with the setting. So the other bits aren't too great, how about the story?\n\nWell...that also is a letdown, actually the opening cinematic to the game spoils everything, the who, what, where and why. I can't compare it to other Might and Magic games, but as far as storytelling goes it’s pretty weak and not engaging at all and it’s extremely linear. The game offers you a very lengthy experience, so that’s something.\n\nHonestly, I was really excited for Might and Magic X and wanted to love it after playing the disappointment that was Heroes of Might and Magic 6. It sapped my strength and will to go on by how boring it was. There's a lot of content for the asking price, maybe if you get nostalgic for these games it will win you over, but for $24.99 USD I'd recommend something else, like Grimrock.\n\nTL/DR; Might and Magic X: Legacy is a long but, boring role-playing experience. None of its qualities are strong enough to make the long trek worthwhile. I’d recommend using the $24.99USD on something else or buy Grimrock. Also Ubisoft making me use U-play ticks me off.\n\n\n-Thumbs down from Royial\n\nVideo Reviews can be found at: www.youtube.com/user/RoyialNetwork","November 19, 2014","false","54.8"," 84 of 130 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","84","130","0","2"

Upon taking the time to enjoy it this time instead of rushing straight into it, I found it far more enjoyable and immersive.\n\nBig fan of the M&M series with my favorite being M&M VII: Blood and Honor. In any case, thoroughly enjoyed this addition to the M&M universe. I've noticed they've incorporated lore and creatures from the more recent M&M titles, which I found quite brilliant as it kind of gels it all together.\n\nMy main highlight of this, as with all M&M titles, was mostly the aspect of adventure and discovery. Your team of four  are thrown into a region packed with monsters to slay and treasure just waiting to be found. Has two difficulties to play through; medium and hard.\n\nFor those looking for a decent adventure and don't mind 'classic style' game mechanics, this is for you.

Possibly for the first time ever in the series even the inventory is (mostly) likeable! Power-up barrels scattered around the world, statues that buff the party, puzzles that have you scratching your head, quest lines without big yellow markers telling you where to go, and last but not least, completely unfair fights if you stick your nose where it doesn't belong. Welcome to the Might & Magic! I've missed being in the M&M world!\n\nFirst and foremost, don't be put off by the rather mediocre ratings -- if you are a fan of the series since the early days, you will love this one too. For the most part I can't but praise the game, but I do have a handful of complaints:\n\n* some of the (teleporter) puzzles are a pain (too much of trial & error);\n* armor wear (i.e. items breaking) is completely useless and should either be redesigned or removed completely;\n* the Falcon and the Unicorn DLC could use some tuning (it's incredibly challenging/frustrating for melee-oriented parties for example).\n\nSome people have been concerned with the PC requirements. I ran the game on highest settings (i7-3770K + Ati Radeon 290) and 90% of the time it runs completely fine. The other 10% of the time there are significant slowdowns, spikes, possibly related to traveling to another section or perhaps from daylight to nighttime switching. Be what it may, the engine could use a little polish in that respect. Also, loading times when entering dungeons or cities are fairly long, up to the point where I would rather run around the city on map than enter to travel through it.\n\nSo much for complaints, because in nearly every other aspect Might & Magic X is a very fun and engaging game. I clocked 50 hours on my playthrough, and for the first time in years I was disappointed a game ended so "soon". More of this, please!\n\nOn a scale from 1-10, I will happily award M&M X a solid 9/10.

Unless you are REALLY desperate for your M&M fix, I can't suggest this as a viable purchase. For the same money, you can get much better titles, new and old.\n\nAs for the actual problems with the game:\n\n-Graphics are laughable. Expect low res environs throughout the game\n\n-Optimization is bad. I can run Skyrim on ultimate with no issues on my rig, but the turn based M&M is apparently too much, as even on middle of the road settings, there is going to be heavy lag in certain areas with dense foliage. According to the forums, this is a fairly common problem.\n\n-No customization. There are 4 races with 4 hero type each (caster, ranger, tank, melee) and once you pick one of those, you get to decide on male or female. Oh, and also a name. Joy... There's no way to change the appearance of your characters and you never even get to see a model of them beyond a picture during character creation.\n\n-Poor class balance. Rangers used to be completely useless, but after the patch they were upgraded all the way to just "meh". The game LOVES to spring ambushes on you (about 30% of the fights, along with most bosses), by dumping a ton of enemies at melee range, making bows and crossbows useless for the fight (once you engage in melee, you can't retreat till you kill everything in melee range). There goes a quarter of the hero pool. Tanks are also useless, since almost all bosses (and all undead, which are VERY frequent) are immune to taunt - your primary tanking mechanic. This means that 50% of the classes in the game have no purpose, except for flavor, at the cost of your party's strenght. That's just bad design.\n\n-Turn based gameplay on a 2-dimensional plane. You can call this a throwback to the old M&M series, but it just doesn't work. Even the worst of Might and Magic games had a smoother transition between turns, than Legacy. The last ones even managed to mix real-time movement with turn-based combat. Also, turn based movement is not fun when on long treks between towns and quest points. This game has a lot of that, if you're looking for all the hidden little nooks and crannies.\n\n-No voice work for quests. While it's not a necessity for every game, it would have been nice if M&M X managed to show off with something, at least.\n\n-Lackluster story. Everything in M&M X screams "minimal effort" and the story is no different. It's painfully generic and set in a very boring world where every character is just a cookie cutter fantasy stereotype. There's just nothing new, even in the story: elves are elves, dwarves are dwarves and orcs wear fezzes (god damn it, Ubisoft...) You can't even augment your party with new and interesting companions. Once you get out of the hero creation screen, that's it - it's set in stone. You DO have the option of getting two followers, but with no voice work and characterization, all they offer is a boost to one (mostly unimportant) aspect of gameplay.\n\nRelative to what else is out on the market, even at this price, Might and Magic X - Legacy is just a bad game. It has nothing to offer, save for the faint nostalgia of the franchise.","June 2, 2014","false","97.7"," 45 of 67 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","45","67","0","0"

I bought and played the game post patch 1, and can honestly say that I've not experienced a single bug, glitch or crash during the entire experience which, after reading some earlier reviews, I half expected I might have! I'd get my one criticism out of the way now though... I played on a fairly powerful gaming laptop and can run most games on high settings with ease. This game is very pretty (some of the screenshots don't do it full justice) but nevertheless, some of the low framerates I get in the outside areas, especially the forests, can be puzzling and I can only imagine could be fixed with better programming, although I'm no expert on that matter :) Aside from this the game is just as I wanted it to be and was a great 'blast from the past' experience in a new suit. Too many modern games hold your hand and take the excitement of exploration away from you, because you know you're never in any real danger. In Might and Magic X it's nothing like that... take a wrong turn and you may get rinsed into oblivion by some elite water elementals you had no right to be near... but that's all part of the games charm. Some people won't get it, and you may hate that sudden, seeimingly unavoidable deaths can occur from nowhere, or you may not enjoy an epic 20 minute struggle to overcome 3 goblins and a big dog that leaves you mentally exhausted (and your characters bereft of potions)... but if you're one of the people who does get it, then get this game... it's ace :)","March 26, 2014","true","46.8"," 22 of 28 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","22","28","0","0"

It is mostly a fun game. It's far better then Might and magic 9, and feels more like the older games. Might and Magic Legacy contains considerable array of fun game play.\n\nI enjoy its quests, puzzles, artwork and music. the class structure and progression is pleasing as is most of the game play. Over time, the game clearly has great re-playability and solid involvement from the community at large. However its likely too unfinished, too unforgiving  and too poorly balanced to recommend to most folks.\n\nPrior to the end game (and often during the end game) I had to use cheat tools to transport my characters out of various places to sell goods, level up, stock up on porions and goods, etc breaking up the game play. This is really strange since in the prior games, you could just back track or teleport out when you needed to exit a dungeon.  Had there not been cheat tools I would have found the game unplayable.\n\nI found I had to extensively use community generated hint guides since many  of the game goals are so arbitrary and poorly expressed I got lost easily. This is at odds with the other Might and Magic games and many modern games where I usually do not need to cheat and rarely need hints. Generally the only need I had of community tools in prior versions were for better maps, locations for alchemy ingredients  and trainer locations.\n\nHowever as the end game approached the game has grown more and more tedious. The developer chose to lock you in a dungeon without escape on several occasions the worst of which is the end game. if you don’t plan especially well the game will grow tired and tedious or simply unplayably  difficult. Add to that that some quests can not be completed until you finish the game, and the general uneven game play, I simply cant suggest you buy the game in 2014 until the price comes down. I bought the game at 25% off and feel a bit cheated.\n\nIf you like the turn based style, consider the game only if its on sale (or has come down in price) and after you have exhausted other games in the series and general genre. As time marches on, the community will generate patch fixes , the developers may rebalanced the end game, and mods and such that will greatly improve the game , as it did for mm6-8. However as  the game exists now in mid-2014, it feels poorly balanced, arbitrary and a bit tedious now. Its not a bad game but its hardly excellent either. Its just not worth the high price the developer is asking.\n\nAll that said you will enjoy the game if you like the genre and buy it on sale. You’ll also enjoy the game if you buy it now and wait 6 months or a year for\n\nP.s. the time in game is wildly inaccurate as the game is stable enough to alt-tab away from it and do other things. So my time in game shows the game is quite stable if you have enough memory.","April 27, 2014","false","157.2"," 37 of 57 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","37","57","0","0"

The amount of saves and reloads you will need to do to progress by an inch is absolutely insane. I am playing at Adventurer difficulty which in classic M&M is supposed to be "Normal"... well I have played every single MM from 1 to 9 and I have _NEVER_ had to die and wipe and reload SO many times like in this one. Spellcasters are so useless they become a liability, since for some reason every single mob in the game will always and systematically target them first (oh, your "tank" class got the Challenge skill to distract mobs? Well sucks to be you, because a lot of mobs are either immune to it, or the skill gets resisted or misses).\n\nOkay, enough complaining for now.\n\nSo. I'm looking at this game in the eyes of someone who loved MM3-4-5 (I am actually quite amused by all the people that complain about the tile movement, it's what was games were all about :)), so I was expecting a game somewhat "in tribute" to that.\n\nFirst off, graphics. It's a modern "tile movement" title, actually they quite cleverly built a world that looks smooth but where movement is tile based. On the other hand, sometimes it's a bit tricky to understand where do you need to go, so you will often end up checking the minimap. This is not too bad to be honest, since in the old games you ended up having Wizard Eye cast most of the time and that's what you would be looking at.\nSide note on this, there is a bug that prevents you from changing your texture quality if you open the menu from inside the menu. You need to do it from the main menu of the game!\n\nOn the Storyline I'm not commenting. We all know that it's no longer the original M&M world from NWC. I don't like most of the changes they made, nor I like the fact that it looks like Heroes of M&M is suddendly the "story-driver" of the game. All Sci-fi elements from the classics removed (they were the core of the story, so how can you remove them? Mah.), now it's just a bread and butter fantasy game. This specific title is decorated with a cartload of references to the old games (like Maximus the Knight, Crag Hack the Pirate - yeah no comment on this one -,  the Forbidden Saga quest, just to name a few) but that's not enough to build a story you might care about. There is not going to be Sheltem at the end or anything anyway.\n\nThe Game System is where the entire game is played and that's where things become frustrating, annoying, confusing and misterious. There are four playable races, each with a variety of defensive melee, offensive melee and spellcaster. Each class can further specialize in a prestige class later on. Most of the traditional class names from M&M are completely gone. The base attributes of the characters are no longer the classics either and now we have things like Destiny and Perception (which increases "all attack values by x") and this is where the prime confusing quality of the game shines: it's really hard to understand what each value does. You get 4 attribute points to distribute at each level up, but if you knew better what was the impact of everything, choices would be easier.\nFrom the beginning of the game, melee classes will shine outright, while you will be left very much puzzled over the effectiveness of spells which get resisted systematically. As you move onward, your mages will become a total liability and die repeatedly (making them lose XP in the process, apparently even if you are unconscious you don't get XP, what kind of bizarre design is that?), causing you to enter a tragicly boring loop of eternal save and reload. Gone is the whole hatred system from the old M&M days where mobs would prioritize attacks based on race/class hatred, simply accept the fact that all mobs will always automatically attack and kill your weakest character all the time and you will not be able to do anything about it most of the time. If you add to this the incredibly lazy design choice of making mobs appear out of nowhere all the time (pretty much any meaningful encounter is like that), making strategic placement impossible (since you will always be flanked), you are in an incredibly rough, frustrating ride.\n\nAnd that's the main issue. Making a tribute game to the old days does not mean "make a game stupidly hard". This game is not hard, it's just extremely badly balanced. You need to cross zones with incredibly tough mobs to access areas defended by extremely easy mobs. You need to clear dungeons inhabited on one level by very easy minions and on the next by nigh-impossible elites. It's this constant schizofrenic design that leads to a completely unfun experience, for the mere fact that the immense amount of trial and error required to get anything done will bore you to death. It's a shame really, but unless they release some kind of magical patch that fixes all this, MMX becomes quickly a chore you do not want to play.\n\nAvoid it.","February 2, 2014","false","56.3"," 31 of 47 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","31","47","0","11"

It uses the same base mechanics for Map layout, Movement and Combat, which was fine twenty years ago, but feels pretty clunky today. There is also a few inclusions from Might & Magic 6 like the use of Hirelings and a few categories for Spells and Skills and the use of a Skill and Promotion system.\n\nCharacter creation is more streamlined, but also more boxed in, because everything each Class can learn and to what extent is laid out bare and square with progress bars and totally locked in. You can't add more Points to a Spell or Skill than the Limit of your Rank. There are four Races, each with three distinct Classes that each represents the Might, Hybrid and Magic Class of that Race. There are no limits in regards to which Race and Class you make for your Party, but since the game has no alternative Light Source other than what Magic provides you are going to have a really hard time dealing with Dungeons and underground Areas without a Dwarf (with Fire Magic) or a Class with Light or Dark Magic. If you decide to take a Shot at the Might Achievement you would be really darksided without a Dwarf in the Party, just saying. There are also no requirements for Grandmastery of Light and Dark Magic as there is no kind of Alignment or Reputation system at all.\n\nCombat is quite clunky. You can only attack Enemies that are on the same Line as the one you are standing on and only within a limited Range, which makes Enemy movements look really silly as they slide sideways into Combat and the only Tactic that you can really apply to Combat is to make sure to stand in a Corner, Tunnel or Doorway where the Enemies can't attack you from more than one Side and there is also a limit to how many Enemies can stand on the same Square, which means they will just wait and queue up for the Slaughter. You can only Escape as long as you don't have direct Enemy Contact, but once an Enemy stands next to you you can't move at all.\n\nI can understand why there is no water-walking (no flight, swimming and climbing neither), because that part have been tied into the Story and added as a Roadblock, but I don't understand why there are no Town Portals or Loyds Beacons. Alternatively, you can move around from Obelisk to Obelisk once you have unlocked them and you can add Markers to the Map to remember where they are and what they are called which is visible on the World Map, but they are all quite remote. There is a Spirit Beacon referred to in the description of Primordial Magic as a Spirit Gate, but you can only have ONE one-way ticket for the whole Party despite having several Characters with the same Spell. I really hate all this pointless walking, which it becomes once you have explored it all, because there are never any interruptions or encounters on the Path. The Area Map which is the only Map that shows all the paths can't be zoomed in or out and since there are a lot of Deadends you'll be wasting a lot of time moving from Place to Place, especially when you need to buy a Rank or Spells. There is no free movement at all, but a lot of Maze like Tunnels across the Landscape, through Forests and rocky Terrain. Once you acquire the ability to walk on water you realize that there is remarkably little water that you can actually walk on.\n\nThe only really nice thing the Game offers is that you can add your own Markers to the Map, which is visible on the World Map and Area Map and helps a lot to find Trainers again and to keep track of Obelisk and remember where you've been and so on, but unfortunately the Markers you add to a disconnected Area or City is only visible within that Place.\n\nThere is also no kind of permanent Item Enchantment in the game. You can't make your own Items or Enchant them with Magical Properties. No point in lugging around anything else than Magic Items, that you intend to use.\n\nEach character has an action bar with ten Slots, but only one. There is no switching between them or making more, which is really too limited.\n\nThere is quite a lot of Puzzles and Riddles in the game, which is a bit of a testamony to the old games, but the ones that require you to move around a lot and step on plates in different order or keep track of teleportation Paths are really quite boring and tedious and the clunky Interface is not helpful at all in this regard.\n\nThere are a few funny references to Army of Darkness and other Race specific comments to nature and actions, but unfortunately they are just barely chuckleworthy. Your Characters really bark a lot in Combat.\n\nThe Story, Sound and Dialogue is pretty decent, but the Graphics are really low-res and it doesn't really support any Resolution at all. The game looks exactly the same in 1280x800 as it does in 1920x1200. It really looks at least ten years older than it is, but due to a tremendous lacks of optimization in the Unity Engine, which is powering the Game, it's actually pretty taxing on your GPU for no reason at all. The game looks nice from a Distance with Shadows and different Light Effects, but it's really blurry up close.\n\nI bought the game on Steam, but I also needed to install Ubisofts UPlay and create an Account in order to play the Game, but UPlay is really half-baked. It tracks my Achievements and seriously slow down loading on Area transistions, but it neither record nor unlock Actions and Rewards and thus I can't unlock any new 'free' Areas. I can't unlock any of the Game Content with Upoints.\n\nThe DLC The Falcon & The Unicorn is really short. It's like an End Chapter, which isn't available until you've finished the main Game, and it's actually quite hard. It begins with a Blast of the most cumbersome tediousness of Puzzle solving as the worst parts of the game with a massive moving around. Once you get the hang of it it's quite simple, but incredible boring, because there is really no challenge at all. Until you get it right, until you understand the mechanics it's a massive waste of time.","February 25, 2015","false","133.4"," 45 of 75 people (60%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","60","45","75","3","0"

Back before the graphics were any good and 3D rendering wasn't even a reality for desktop games. The game play is a perfect balance of old and new. Turn based takes me back, and also enhances the strategic part of this type of gaming. There are certainly some difficult sections in this game, where you can encounter monsters that are outright impossible to kill at the level you are in the game, so be careful.

For example, you can write there "spells" next to a shop where you can do that, or "axe" at a spot where you can level up a characters axe skill.\n- Some replayability possible. The puzzles and enemies will be the same, but you can build a different party of different classes and thus attempt to beat the game with a different setup, using the higher of the two available difficulty modes.\n- Some of the puzzles and riddles are fun.\n\nWhat I dislike:\n- Ubisoft. That means you have to deal with Ubisofts Uplay nonsense, bad support, DRM and whatnot.\n- The game is sometimes a bit sparse in matters of telling you where to do what. Without researching sometimes on the internet where to do what, you might get frustrated.\n- I had one annoying bug so far.\n- Sometimes, every couple of hours, it crashes. Since it saves automatically ever now and then and has a quicksave option, this is bearable though.\n- The graphics are mixed. They're not good, but some models and parts of the dungeons look nice. Other parts, especially outdoor textures, look very bad if you get closed.\n\nNeutral:\n- Some of the game mechanics make sense gameplaywise but are highly illogical. For example, the buffs on your party (like one that protects you from damage) last a certain number of turns (during combat) or moves. But you can, for example, rest for 8 hours to regenerate your party, and those buffs are all still up. Sometimes you can also rest for 8 hours before a boss fight, and the boss will just wait until you're done.\n- In some of those old RPGs I liked that the positioning of the party mattered (melee fighters in the front, ranged fighters and spell casters in the back). In this game, the positioning is irrelevant.\n- The difficulty is not increasing in an entirely linear way. You will encounter enemies you can't beat at that point. On the other hand, the game saves automatically all the time, so you just reload and ignore that part for the time being.\n\nSo, all in all, if you like those retro-RPGs, this one is ok. It's not great, but is entertaining enough. 25 Euro is a bit expensive in my opinion, but for 15 Euro or less, like during a Steam Sale, I can easily recommend it, as far as you don't buy it randomly but realized that you get a retro style RPG instead of a new Witcher or Elder Scrolls. Well, and you have to be aware that there are still a couple of bugs in the game.","February 15","true","109.0"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

I had to buy a new copy of Windows, since my old one was OEM and I had changed out the motherboard.\nUnity still sucks and it is still an insane resource hog, but the game itself is kinda fun.\nPS- I haven't spent that many hours playing it. If I'm alt tabbed out of it for a day or two, or even if uplay is just still running, and SOMETIMES even steam, then Steam thinks I'm playing.\n\nFOR 32 BIT OS-\n\nUnity? Really?\nEither it is the game engine itself, or this game has been so poorly coded that it has zero optimization and demands more memory usage than, well, any other game out there.\nThis, despite it being a small game that has nothing close to cutting edge technology. It is a retro style game with grid movement.\nAs a result of the poor coding or poor game engine, while 32 bit software is listed as supported, it really isn't, as the game only partially works with it.\nUsing a 32 bit OS (even Windows 7) you only get some sounds. No player barks, no ambient sounds, no monster sounds. Just some music and button clicking sounds.\nAlso, you only get "medium" textures, but this is a deceptive turm, since the texture quality is low- medium- high- very high- ultra.\nWith medium level textures, this game looks like it was made by two indie game developers in a basement during their time off from work. In the year 2003.\nThis is a shame, as a lot of love and hard work has clearly been poured into the game, and it's artwork.\nPretty sad for me, too, as I've been waiting so very, very long for a new Might and Magic game! Might and Magic III was my frst game in the series. I played that little RPG to death!\n\nIf you have a 64 bit OS, I'm sure it's great.\nIf you have a 32 bit OS, and, like me, cannot afford to upgrade/lost your original CD and key, don't bother. I know it's listed in the steam store as being supported, and it's listed by ubisoft as being supported, but that's a lie. If you complain, they'll cut and paste a blurb about how it isn't recommended and you should just upgrade to a 64 bit OS. Thanks, guys.\n\nA lot of people were decived by what they heard about the early release, too, since 32 bit OS players could, pre-release, play with all the sound and max texture quality, instead of the butt-ugly silent thing they got at release.\n\nSpeaking of, I bought the digital deluxe version.  Where's my soundtrack? I was supposed to get a soundtrack for paying the $5 extra for my butt-ugly game.\n\nAnd really? I used Steam because I hate uPlay and how flaky it is. But no. Nope! You have to go through TWO DRM software systems. You have to go through Steam, and then what loads up? uPlay! Awesome! So you have to be running Steam and uPlay to run this game. AND use an activation key. A key which Steam seems to think it needs you to copy and paste and apply EVERY TIME YOU START THE GAME. You also get to sit and watch it try to install dirextX and .net framework and something else every time you start it up. Come on now, son. Come on.\n\nDo you really think everyone's going to want to pirate this game so badly?\n\nOh, and thanks for adding in the paper doll int he inventory that everyone wanted. Except... y'all missed the whole point of it. We liked the paper doll in 6-8 because you could put them in the armor you found, and see it. Instead, it's just an illustration of the class and gender, and one of two (way too small for some reason, in a number of cases) heads that just gets pasted on the body interchangeably, per race and gender. Zzzz. Pointless...\n\nThe good? You want the good? Okay. Well, I like that they brought back the characters showing their state of health in their main portraits. Somebody gets poisoned? They turn green and look sick. That's neat.\n\nThe 2D UI looks nice. I wish the game world didn't look like orc poop, but the UI looks nice.\n\nThe action bar is a good thing. Having access to more than one spell at the click of a button is a great idea.\n\nThat's... that's all I can think of. I keep trying to play it. I keep trying to get into it and I just can't. It's so broken in a 32 bit OS. :(\n\nSorry. it sucks.","January 24, 2014","true","245.8"," 21 of 34 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","21","34","0","2"

There's also other classic additions, such as portraits of your characters in-game. Many of the distinct Might and Magic sounds from the games 7-9 have been re-used, which brings back memories.\n+ Graphically, the game looks modern and interesting, which is great.\n+ A fairly large game world to explore with relative freedom, quite a few quests to engage in as well, along with class promotions.\n+ Story is intriguing and lengthy, took me about 55 hours to complete all main quests, with side quests included.\n+ Lots of different monsters to fight - naga samurai, air, earth, fire and water elementals, brigands, harpies, griffins, cyclopses, goblins, minotaurs...and many more.\n- Turn based combat which is different from Might and Magic 7-9, but actually works really well, giving you a chance to tactically assess what spells you'll cast and how you'll attack.\n\nNegatives:\n\n- Throughout the game a lot of audio is constantly repeated (such as locals talking), and for some people this might get irritating.\n- Decent amount of puzzles with varying difficulties, although I found some of these to be tedious, boring and annoying, resorting to simply googling the solutions.\n- Grid based movement, which is a step down from conventional games where you can freely turn and walk in any direction. While this isn't ideal it doesn't drastically impact on the fun of the game, it just means it's not as fluid as it could have been.\n\nOverall Score: 8/10\n\nMight and Magic X - Legacy is an excellent RPG which mirrors the old series from the 1990s.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cosmicengine/recommended/238750/","cosmicengine","Cosmic Engine","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cosmicengine/","309 products in account","http://youtu.be/-CkJG8m6RAE\n\n\nwelcome to the most recent addition to the Might & Magic series, Might & Magic X Legacy. Developed by Limbic Entertainment and published by Ubisoft, Might & Magic X legacy was released on January 23, 2014.\n\nThe game is a throw back to the RPG's of old, adopting very traditional PC RPG mechanics. You start the game with the option of customizable character creation or the choice of choosing a default party of characters. Character creation is limited in terms of real personalization, you have the option of basically choosing a heroic voice or a cynical voice and that is about the depth of their personalties. My advice is to choose heroic every time as the cynical characters tend to repeat the same god damn four lines of speech every five minutes and it becomes tiresome. Other parts of character creations are good, there’s four races to choose from which span your clique elves, orcs, dwarfs and men. Each race has three unique classes to choose from, one might class, one magic class and a hybrid class.\n\nLegacy injects a lovely sense of nostalgia and really does bring you back to the series of ten plus years ago. However once that nostalgia ends what are you left with? Well a combination of good mechanics, dated mechanics and strange design choices.\n\nLets start with movement outside of combat, I have no idea why the developers and ubisoft went for grid based movement outside of combat. Wanting a grid based combat system is one thing, out of combat grid based movement is quite another. While going for the retro feel is one thing, using dated movement that becomes boorish and frustrating is quite another. I really do feel that grid based world movement is a relic of a bygone era that does not need to resurface. The developers of the old might and magic games did not have grid based moment because they wanted too, it was a technological limitation of the time period, that limitation no longer exists so the lack of free world movement feels very contrived.\n\nThe over world design itself doesn't really make sense you have a little lighthouse that nearly spans a 5 by 5 area and then a supposed huge castle that takes up the same amount of space. Places and objects in the world are not in proportion and it actually becomes immersion breaking to the point of silliness. Someone should also speak to the builders of the island as they need to be introduced to the concept of roads, how any of the citizens travel in that place is beyond me.\n\nThe games graphics are confused too, you'll go from a really nice looking area, to areas riddled with poor textures, draw distance problems and outright texture load issues. I feel that Ubisoft really didn't give the game the budget it deserved and while the games graphics are in no way bad they are comparable to that of older games like elder scrolls oblivion even on its highest settings.\n\nCombat is where the game shines, the combat system is very traditional Might & Magic combat which is by no means a bad thing. I am certainly a fan of turn based combat and always have been, it is a solid mechanic that remains fun to this day. Fights are challenging and fun making you really consider each action you take to ensure your teams survival. The problem with the combat lies in smaller design choices I don't understand. Without any warning the game seems to regularly bump up the difficulty for no logical reason, for example you can clear the first two levels of a dungeon with no fuss then suddenly on the third the enemies are a lot tougher sometimes to the point of killing your entire party in one fell swoop. You can regularly run into much higher level opponents in the world that will just kill your characters in one move, which is fine in one sense but not in other. I like the fact there are enemies you cannot defeat yet, however having one of these enemies in a cave right outside of the first starting town is annoying. You cannot choose to escape from battle, so once you accidentally stumble into an area to high level for you and engage in combat, you might as well load your last save right there. Barring the few minor annoyances combat does remain fun, engaging and challenging.\n\nLevelling up again while simple suffers from strange design choices. When you level you receive attribute points to improve your base stats and skill points to improve your proficient with skills. Now any logical person would think to place tab these two menus right next too each other but no. instead you have to press the absurdly small level up button to place attribute points then close that menu to press the other small button to open the skills menu. The is a good amount of depth once in game to tailor the characters to the way you want them, there’s plenty of stats and skills to customize as is always the case in Might & Magic. The game doesn't do well in explaining skill related mechanics to players unfamiliar with the series, in fact the game has no tutorial at all and while I am a fan on games not holding your hand. It would be easy to miss that to improve skills you need to find a trainer, which by the way a spread out in an unhelpful way.\n\nThe reason I love RPG's so much is due to their rich, well told characters and story. Might & Magic X Legacy's story is about as deep as a puddle in the middle of the desert, on the sun. There is no reason what so ever to care about the characters in the game, they are all as generic as any clique uninteresting fantasy characters. The back story of your characters goes as far as, your mercenaries looking for adventure, quaint. The games main story itself, is little more than a pointless excuse to visit the various dungeons with even the governor of the island basically stating that you hold no ties to the empire and thus have no reason what so ever to help them basically by saying (office space style) 'uhhh, if you could go ahead and restore all the elemental altars... that would be great.' it makes even less sense considering the empire has an army, paladins, griffon riders and a myriad of resources available to combat the threat, the reason they don't? Who knows.\n\nIn all the game provides a good nostalgic feel but past that I feel disappointed. Those looking for a old school RPG will find it here. I feel that instead of trying to push the franchise forward Ubisoft have created a dated RPG experience and cashed in on the franchises name. I have to ask why this game needed to be made, yes make more Might & Magic games but don't replicate the mechanics over and over. Push forward, make better experiences, I'm not saying take out what makes Might & Magic, Might & Magic but at least bring the franchise into the modern era. Also Uplay is awful, stop putting that ♥♥♥♥ in your damn games Ubisoft.\n","February 27, 2014","true","5.8"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","8","10","0","0"

However, I was pleasantly surprised when the final release came out that a large number of the issues I had with the game had been addressed. Overall, M&MX does a good job of capturing the old school vibe of earlier entries in the system, while taking advantage of some of their later design improvements first seen in their Heroes series of games.\n\nThat said, the game misses the mark in several ways. First, the graphic performance is very disappointing. It looks like a game optimized for 5+ years ago. The creation and skill system does a poor job of helping new players understand pros and cons of the abilities and how they impact gameplay. The amount of running through previously cleared areas is frustrating. The limited voice acting is grating and repetitive.\n\nDespite those disappointments, this does scratch the itch for a classic, party-based, first person roleplaying experience. The exploration, discovery, hidden bits, and character classes do feel like previous entries in the system. For a truly authentic experience, and to help off-set the disappointing graphics, I strongly recommend selecting the "classic pixelated" display found in the gameplay settings menu.\n\nOther pros - once you're familiar with the game, the classes are diverse and offer a lot of variety in how you want to build your party. Combat is tactical enough to be satisfying without slowing the game down too much. Boss fights are brutal but winnable with careful play. The cool epic items that level up with your character are awesome. It's casual enough to be approachable by a wide audience. It's a fairly good value for its pricepoint. It has a strong nostalgia element.\n\nI think people familiar with other games in the series will be most likely to enjoy this version, but it shouldn't stop new players from giving it a shot!","January 29, 2014","true","46.0"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

Depending on what you are into, this is either a good or bad thing.  I definitly like this game although the only thing I dislike about it (and old-school thing) is that there are a fair amount of riddles and puzzles.  While not particularly hard, I do not have the patience for these and find them quite tiresome.\n\nThe loot is also uninspiring.  Pretty much I found the best weapons when I got to the 2nd town (very early in the game) and by the end of the game I only found replacements that were *slightly* better and these were supposid 'relics' of power.\n\nMy final complaint is the events leading up to the final battle.  You go through several long levels of fighting the same enemies over and over.  It is quite tedious and boring.  I mean, if you have destroyed 10 sets of the same enemies under various "ambush" scenerios, I think you have proven your point that you can handle these guys.  Why then, make you go on and fight another 40 sets of these guys?

I bought it way back in early access but I waited because I knew it would only get better and I didn't want to ruin my final experience with the game. It seems some people's experiences in early access weren't that great.\n\nI am having quite a bit of fun with it. There's a fair amount of character customization that you can do at the beginning of the game though not quite as much as  the M&M6-8 games. Mainly because you pick 1 of 4 races and each race has 3 class option. Those classes are a little bit limited in their further skill customization but there's still a fair amount of diversity to be had in terms of skill choices. You're also limited to 2 voice choices and 2 male potraits as well as 2 female portraits. At first I thought that it was a bit weak but I figured it didn't really matter what they looked or sounded like.\n\nAs far as the gameplay goes I found a lot of things nostalgic. The sounds they used, the way you interact with buildings, and a few other things reminded me a lot of M&M6-8. The big difference being it's not free roam and it's on a grid but you know what, I'm fine with that. If it was free movement people would compare it to other open world games and that's not fair. It works fine that it's grid based and I didn't find it to hurt the experience at all. When you level up there's lots of customization to be had in terms of skill lines to put skill points into and stat points to distribute. There's also plenty of loot to plunder and equip even though it's kind of annoying how much +resistance gear there is. It feels like a cheap cop out way to avoid giving you a useful stat on the item. Every single green item has +resistance and you have to find a blue item to even get an item worth caring about as green items don't roll anything but +resistance which is all but pointless.\n\nOverall I would recommend this game to fans of the series and you should realize this game is a bit different than the M&M6-8 games. That doesn't mean you should avoid it though as there's a lot of fun to be had. Even people who are new to the series.

However, it's hard to get into, has a number of flaws, uses outdated soundbytes, and generally feels very unfinished. It doesn't feel like a betrayal to the series or anything like that, but this game is built from a lot of unrealized potential. I would not suggest this game to others unless they like the world of Ashan or want another dungeon crawler in game library. It's a solid turn-based dungeon delving game, but I wouldn't call the story I've seen impressive or the gameplay innovative.\n\nMight and Magic X is a strange beast to me. It's an enjoyable game once you get past the ghastly introduction and a fairly deadly tutorial; however, it has a rather unpolished quality about it in general. As others have mentioned, the game has more in common with the original Might and Magic games (1-5) than it does the latter end of the series (6-9), at least so far as gameplay goes. It's based on the world of Ashan, which you will know if you've played Heroes of Might and Magic 5 or 6, on a peninsula consisting of a few towns and cities in an era of rebellion and religious turmoil.\n\nFirst, since combat is so integral to any dungeon delving series, let's take a gander at the good side of that. Combat in Legacy is turn-based and square-based. As said above, if you're familiar with how old Might and Magic games played, or if you like Legend of Grimrock, then this will feel like familiar territory to you. The game uses this to its advantage as much as you do at times: enemies will sometimes move to flank you, doubly so if they "spawn" in a position from which it is perfect for them to do so, and opponents in dungeons typically attack from places that put your party at a severe disadvantage. This makes fights challenging, and forces you to make plans around the terrain you're fighting in if you can. Tossing enemies away from you with a gust of wind or immobilizing them before they can reach you so you can reach limit the number of melee attackers on you, or ducking around a corner so the enemy mage will have to walk into smacking distance to chuck a spell at you... This game encourages tactical thinking, and that's what turn-based gameplay is all about.\n\nNow, let's discuss the bad part of combat. First, there's the fact that a lot of enemies do seemingly appear out of thin air. Ubisoft seems to be a fan of having your opponents, even when visible, be unable to be struck until  You will encounter this problem in the very first dungeon you ever touch, in the tutorial: spiders will drop from the ceiling and initiate melee combat with you immediately, before you can react. This would not be a problem except for the fact that entering in any melee combat prevents you from moving away from your current square. Let me repeat that: melee combat stops you from going anywhere. That means if you have even a single opponent on your face, you can't pull your part back a single tile into a defensible corridor to fight your opponents a few at a time. No, you're stuck standing in the middle of a terrible position where nine enemies can surround you, listening to your idiot adventurers screaming "Sorry, I'm a little busy right now!" when you're trying to get them to move somewhere they won't die. Apparently, the heroes of Ashan were never taught the intricacies of the tactical withdrawl. It's rather aggravating, and even after you've learned to deal with this limitation, you won't learn to like it.\n\nThere are a lot of other little problems I have with the combat system, such as poison lasting forever until cured (and you'll encounter a LOT of poison at level 1). They don't ruin the game, but combined these flaws make combat feel... well, flawed. A small aside: ranged combat can be fun, but in my experience you'll rarely get the chance to enjoy it due to being locked in melee combat most of the time. Your ranged damage will be negligible once your party is fighting in close quarters.\n\nAs I mentioned previously, the game lacks polish. I could talk about the graphics (though I'm not really a graphics-oriented person), which are lackluster, but I'm more inclined to talk about the various, small details of the game that could use changing. For one, Ubisoft has lazily taken sound bytes from previous games in the series - very outdated soundbytes, mind you - and slapped them into Might and Magic X. Perhaps they were trying to elicit some feelings of nostalgia from those who played Might and Magic 6, 7 and 8, but all the sound bytes taken from those games just sound so very out of place and old.\n\nThere are very limited voice options for your playable characters (a 'heroic' or 'cynical' voice for each race/gender combo), and several of them reuse the exact same lines. That is, the humans and dwarves say almost the exact same thing, everyone sounds like they came from the British Isles, and the characters' lines get very repetitive very quickly. (I left the first town in Act 1 as quickly as I could just to get my dwarves to stop talking about how darned boring the place was.) Non-player characters with a voice actor in the open world don't even move their mouths when speaking to you; games as old as Wizardry 8 have at least gotten THAT down.\n\nThe tutorial doesn't really cover leveling up well (if at all; I can't remember if it mentions it), which is annoying because players new to the series won't know to look for the 'skills' tab and place points there, and the skills tab being a subsection of the spells tab is very obnoxious, and... Well, whoa. Like I said earlier, there's a lot of polishing up and balancing that needs to be done to the game. The user interface and the tutorial just aren't built properly.\n\nDespite this, I found the game fun; very fun. I'm going to keep playing it as I have been. However, if Ubisoft doesn't make improvements by the time the next game in the series rolls about, I'll be very disappointed, because the game could be so much better than it is right now. I like the variety in classes in the game; I like the ideas Ubisoft had in making race actually matter a little bit (as far as conversations with NPCs go at least). If you are willing to overlook this game's flaws, it will be great fun, and there's a rather rewarding experience awaiting you once you get past the nasty shell that is the game's introduction. If not, well, don't buy the game.","June 16, 2014","true","38.4"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/el_julio/recommended/238750/","el_julio","George Bashington","http://steamcommunity.com/id/el_julio/","174 products in account","Damn, this game gave me a headache. Should I recommend it or not? Is it, in the end, a good or a bad game?\n\nWell it is both. You're welcome. ;)\n\nIn fact, MMX is a great old-school RPG, and some might hate it. If you don't like turn-based games, forget about it right away. It will appeal mostly to people who started playing computer games in the 80's and 90's. This said, this category of gamers will regret going back to another feature that was typical of the era: infinite loading times. This is, by far, the most annoying thing in this great game. You'll have to suffer long loadings every two minutes, because it makes you travel a lot, and reload saved games a lot. It is, apparently, very badly programed and suffers from huge stuttering issues on any machine. It runs "smoother" on 64-bit systems but doesn't really take advantage of huge amounts of memory as it could. Maybe it emulates floppy disks, I don't know. Let's call it a feature. Oh, and the world looks more like a maze than like an open world, making it difficult to find your way, even if you've discovered every square inch of land (or sea). If you were used to rushing from west to east in a matter of seconds in the old MM series (by tapping arrow keys madly, like Stakanov), you'll be disappointed by how long it takes to travel. It expands the world size artificially, but it works eventually.\n\nNow that's all for the bad stuff.\n\nGood things about this game? Mainly all the rest. First thing first, it is DIFFICULT. You'll spend hours trying to find the few roads/places where you're safe enough to gain some experience while avoiding dying every minute. Then you'll come back to places that were previously unaccessible to your party and kick some ♥♥♥♥. Or not, and die again. And again. More often than in the old games, except maybe MM6 which was very open and very difficult too.\n\nYou'll soon discover that you have to make careful choices in your skills, for every character in the party. At first, you'll also be poor as hell, which means that you'll have a hard time training your party while in the meantime healing it, buying new stuff and potions, identifying loot, etc. And then, half way from the end, you'll have not to care about money anymore since you'll have a good 100 k that will never be spent.\n\nBut don't be fooled: money is one of your problems at first, but not the only one. Money will not buy you extraordinary items that can save your ♥♥♥♥. It will help, but it is not the solution to all your problems. Exploration is much more rewarding than shopping, and as soon as two of your party members will be equiped with fine stuff, things will get easier. A few relics later and you'll be able to deal enough damage to cyclops. Yeeha!\n\nThen, there's magic. Remember the title, Might & Magic? Right, you'll need both. All the time. You'll need healing all the time, and above all, good warding spells. With good loot and a good spellcasting timing, you can take on almost any mob - if you're lucky. Yes, luck counts a lot. On the good side, it allows you to do critical damage. On the bad side, so it does for monsters. So you might litteraly obliterate a monster to 10% of its health, then it will do a beautiful critical strike and kill two party members in one blow. And they will not benefit from the experience gained from the fight...\n\nNow, should you reload or deal with it and visit a temple ASAP? It's all up to you. You can try again until only your party makes huge amounts of damage, or play fair. You can think hard about a specific puzzle's logic and finally understand how it works, or you can try any combination until the damn chest opens. You can take notes (real notes, on paper) or look for answers on the internet. Play fair and suffer a lot or play safe and... suffer a lot, but a bit less.\n\nThis game rewards people who like exploring, and who are willing to come back to the same place they died a dozen times before just to see if now, it might be ok. And yes! It opens a new area. Now I can die again! Oh God, now I remember how loud I yelled at my computer in 1994, and why. And I also remember why I kept on playing. Damn, it's good.\n\nBUT PLEASE DO SOMETHING ABOUT THE LOADING TIMES.","January 31, 2014","true","68.1"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

This forces you to explore everywhere in order to level up, and will greatly reward you for searching every nook and cranny.\n\nThis game has one interesting niche that sets it apart from other games, everything is finite. There are no respawning monsters, no respawning loot etc. This creates a sense of meaningfulness to every choice you make, when you spend your gold or sell equipment. Because of the way the game is set up you'll often run into enemies that are far too hard for you, or bosses you can't handle yet. I consider this a positive, as it encourages you to explore the world more in order to gear up / level up.\n\nIf you read other reviews pros and cons, I would agree with most of them. However , this game stands out from other turn based RPG's so much, that I can't help but recommend it. I would love to see a M&M X-2 style game, improving upon it's strengths, and adding more customizability.\n\nPick it up on sale.

It's badly programmed, horribly optimized, and it runs like ♥♥♥♥ on even the best computers.  The voice acting is lousy, the plot is erratic and, frankly, uninteresting.  The pacing is completely uncontrolled and the game does a terrible job of telling you where to go so you will likely frequently wander into enemies far too strong for you.  This is complemented by a battle system that makes it impossible to flee if you come into contact with an enemy you cannot defeat.  Oh, and there are a ton of annoying little bugs that Ubisoft has no solutions for, beyond "Try restarting the game."

MMX is a first person grid turn based dungeon crawler, unlike the free roaming open ended  gameplay of the previous 4 entries (that where created about a decade ago). As the 10th entry into the series, you will find the developer, and publisher Ubisoft, has decided to ignore why the games series previous and fantastic improvements (9 is the exception) by making this a turn based mess. Essentially, the game series went from what I considered the best of the FPS/RPGs (if love casting and shooting while keeping distance and strafing) to a slow paced stratedy game that is relitivly unplayable. I will state this, I can beat MM 6, 7, & 8 by using ANY team that was pre-built for me. If someone wanted to make me a team with 4 clerics, I will figure it out. The previous games where not only slightly forgiving, but the level of satisfaction when you take down massively powerful enemies with fast thinking, running and gunning, and guiding monsters made the previous games some of the greatest power trips a game has ever made me feel. Turning God mode on and cheating is boring, becoming godlike and DECIMATING MASSES OF THOSE WHO HAVE WRONGED YOU EARLIER ON IS FANTASTIC! I loved mowing down fields of enemies in the previous games while keeping a steady radius of death just steps away from me. There is nothing even close to that level of enjoyment with Might and Magic X - Legacy. Its just a slow grid grind of posturing.\nTo put it blunt, with MMX, if you do not build a "perfect team" you won't get past the first dungeon. There feels like no character growth, because the game postures you to always be the weakling, until you hit the threshold of level/area and then it becomes stupid easy, and ultimately boring. I am fine with grid based games... for smaller devolpers. Legend of Grimrock is a great game that is cheap, about 1 gig of space, and is fast paced for a grid dungeon game. MMX is a slow paced, combat heavy, character dependent mess. With the team that Ubisoft has, I would hope for better; and rather than deliver what fans of the game series want ( I am sorry, but citing the people that only like the enteries from 1995 and back is just BS, as GOG clearly pushes 6-8 on their website because IT SELLS MORE AND HAS A BIGGER FANBASE) they just flippantly push out this game and tell us that it is how the series will be going. Someone should be fired for the decision. It takes what could have been the next entry into a fantastic series, spaghetti codes it, and makes it a boring, buggy, unplayble mess.\nI want to like this game, and I have tried to like this game. With the previous ones, as I said before, you do not really need a guide to do anything, you kinda just figure it out. With this entry to the series, it breaks gameplay to have to look up optimal character builds so you can beat a spider. It kills gameplay when the game is so combat driven that any choices for character creation that are whimsicle are rebuked with a re-roll. It breaks gameplay when you have to look up strategies to beat normal characters, or optimize for each dungeon. I like strategy, to a point; but there is a point where dying without learning how to overcome a scenario, unless I consult other material, takes me out of the game outright. And thats what this game feels like, is something that was overburdened with a developer who kept saying "make it more old school" well I am sorry but when they did that in the 90's we had to either figure it out or buy a guide, since then the internet has made it so that making games like this is not fun when you know that the solution is a search away. It lacks gameplay, it exhausts my graphics card for some reason (and graphically, this shouldn't be that intense of a game) and overall it just makes me want to play the previous and far supirior games. Even if you like this style of gameplay, there are better and much more satisfying games like this (Legend of Grimrock is a perfect example) that won't hurt your budget, and won't give money to a developer that obviously disregards its fanbase.","April 27, 2015","false","2.5"," 48 of 90 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","48","90","0","0"

Additionally if you uninstall for whatever reason and re-install if you didn’t personally back up your saves they may just disappear.\n\nIn the game the general forced turn-based style (which while in heroes has been optional in regular Might and magic since 1995) not only slows the game down to a crawl but makes it incredibly easy to defeat enemies, in actuality the only time you will ever have any difficulty in this game is when they force you onto a ledge before spawning the enemies or in hallways where you magically get surrounded. But the worst offense this game commits is making it impossible to fix any mistake you made. Now I know I said enemies were easy so this shouldn’t be a problem but it is since no enemy ever respawns there is a limited amount of gold and exp in the world and dead characters don’t get exp. So in those rare fights where you get surrounded and one of your party members falls it misses out on everything, and this can be especially troubling if you are under-leveled for a boss (bosses tend to be either right next to you or force you onto a ledge and then over) because you think “oh I only need a little bit more exp then I can do this” but there’s nothing left you have to reload from a save usually a few hours (minimum due to the slow pace of the game) and do everything again hoping that this time you will only to find out that you needed to load further back in your files.\n\nPersonally this game I did say I liked and I’ll tell you exactly why, because Might and Magic 6 was the first great game I ever was able to play being able to play another “updated” version of the game made me excited about the future prospects, but since its release there has been no hit at another in the franchise that I am aware of so the hopes of playing another good might and magic game have been dashed.\n\nAlso in the older games the voices and sound effects though primitive were clever and original, whereas here in this game everything sounds like a b-reel fantasy sound clip there\n\nThe best analogy I can give to this game is imagine someone saw a beloved franchise like say Half-life, now imagine Ubisoft bought Half-life, sure we’d get a Half-life 3 and maybe more, but the game would be completely different with nearly no regard (except for names and maybe general models) for the source materials…\n\nIn conclusion, Don’t waste your money go find a copy of Might and Magic 6, 7, and 8 (12$ probably total) and enjoy a good 50+ hours of classic fantasy games that are actually good.\n","May 13","false","79.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

First of all, I know it is grid-based. It says it in the description and it's what the devs keep saying. But let's take a small look at the title. Might & Magic X. This is supposed to be a SEQUEL to VI, VII, VIII and IX. In other words, I expect something better that keeps innovating the genre. Why the *#$&* they went back to IV, V is beyond me. As if VI (1998) is not retro enough to duplicate.\n\nMe? I started playing the series because of VI. I loved it. I could never get myself to play I - V because it's not what I was used to. VI - IX had open worlds to explore and do quests at your own pace. Going from one side of town to the other did not take take 10 freaking minutes like it does with this game.\n\nSo, the game is grid-based and I started to accept that. But even if I did, the system here is done horribly. Everything, from the controls to the animations is very ackward. You can only cast damaging spells or shoot arrows when you're enemies are in a straight line! My D&D board game allows me to shoot monsters diagonally, and that game does not even have a game engine! It's a board with some plastic figures on it and it functions better than the almighty M&MX.\n\nGraphics are terrible. Every single human being and monsters look like plastic. I can make better animations shooting Stop Motion with my Lego-sets using a iPhone 1. The levels, towns and dungeons are poorly designed. And to add insult to injury, the graphics suggest that there are things to click on. Which is impossible, because most of the objects that seem clickable are out of range. Grid-based. Great Idea.\n\nI can write an entire book about why I am disappointed with this game. It's pretty ironic that if you purchase this, you get the best Might & Magic game; Might & Magic VI: The Mandate of Heaven. I would recommend buying the older games on gog.com and leave this game alone.\n\nWait, I forgot to say something positive about the game.

Your gameplay rewards will mostly come from seeing your carefully-planned party composition hit its stride around the mid-levels, when your bladesinger has enough stats to chunk mobs for big satisfying criticals. This game will mostly appeal to RPG fans born in the very early 80s or older, since it's a throwback to the Xeen/Terra style of gameplay. It includes all the quirks of those previous games such as tile movement, turn-based combat, random stat-increasing barrels and high-level party-oneshotting dragons in the midst of a lowly bandits and wolves. Full shameless nostalgia.\n\n\nCons: It's still buggy. Your party can get stuck around teleporters, music and ambient sounds can loop forever, and some events don't trigger. Also many parts are under-developed. Armor system is underbaked (you can finish the game with your warrior wearing cloth), a couple spells are placeholders (eg liquid membrane), some classes are more fleshed out than others, tanking is near-useless, there is an overdependence on specific spells (eg Celestial Armor, Burning Determination and Whispering Secrets) which make or break your game.","February 16, 2014","true","54.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

MM9 was a disaster... so rushed, so bugged that sold poorly. So poorly that it was the main responsible for 3DO's demise.\n\nThen, 10 years later, they announce a new Might and Magic. Its not made by Jon Van Caneghem, and its OBVIOUSLY not made by 3DO. Still... is this the  game I've waited 10 years for? Short answer is NO. Where's our open wold? All MMs featured fully open worlds, where the only barrier iour courage to tackle stronger enemies. In MMX, you have to clear one area to be able to go to the next!\n\nThen there's my second issue with this game: where's the enemy respawn? All MMs have some form of enemy respawn, which enables you to develop your characters as much as you want! Remember the enemy lairs in Might and Magic 3-5, that if you don't destroy, the area will repopulate within a few mounths? Its GONE in here.  No respawn means that there's a cap to how much you can level in each area, and considering how linear this game is, this means that if a boss is too tough for you, you can't just go to another areas to level up some more!\n\nThe developers PPROMISSED respawning enemies, and thats one of the reasons I bought the early access. Then again Ubisoft also promissed a real modular game, yet never said that we need to BUY a 1,500 dollars software to be able to create MODs for it! They also never said that 32-bit users would get a capped experience. Heck, the early access worked perfectly on 32-bit OSs. Why they changed it?\n\nOn the other hand, not everything in this game is bad. The graphics (if you have a 64-bit OS) are actually decent, with some beautifull landscapes and amazingly animated enemies. The sounds are great: sound effects are realistic, the voices are actually good, and each place has some very realistic ambient sounds (birds when you are near a forest, loud people when you are in a town, etc).\n\nThe gamepay is surprinsingly good. They decided to make this game very old-scool, so they opted to use tile-based movement and turn-based battles. I like this in RPGs, it gives the game a more strategic feel. Most boss battles actually requires you to THINK before acting, and if you just randomly attack, you'll die in VERY few turns. The interface, on the other hand, isn't as limited as most games of our youth. While you can still use your spellbook to select spells and abilities, now you can use a very handy numbered action bar, and activate each action with the numeric keys. Believe-me it helps. There's even the ability to set map notes, something that we would LOVE back in the day.\n\nThe game isn't very long though. Its one of the shortest MMs (only MM8 feels shorter than this one), but don't expect to beat it in a few hours. We are looking at a 40+ hours journey here, more if you select the hardest mode (yeah, you have a difficulty selector in here).\n\nAnyway, this isn't as good as I was expecting. The lack of enemy respawns makes mea bit angry, and the fact that they decided to break the game into acts is ridiculous! Still, this is a 7/10 game. Really, I'm a bit disappointed at this game, and i'm a HUGE fan of World of Xeen and Isles of Terra... Still, its a worthy game to carry the Might and Magic name.\n\nNow, lets just hope the modding community can fix this game, right?\n\n\nThe good:\n\n+Graphics are actually good, and the sounds are amazing;\n+The turn-based and tile-based gameplay is back, and its great!!\n+Gameplay is great;\n+The classes are varied and nice to use;\n+The enemy models are very detailed, and have a very smooth movement;\n+Great dungeons, some are actually quite big;\n+The enemies actually look nice.\n\n\nThe bad:\n-Graphics aren't as good if you use a 32-bit OS, and the voices are GONE.\n-The classes are not well balanced;\n-The game starts out too linear, and has been divided into ACTs;\n-There's NO enemy respawn, not even optional like the older MMs.","January 25, 2014","true","31.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I don’t know if I changed or this game is just better than the rest of the games in the series, or what happened.  I just have a lot of fun playing it and it gives me that same feeling I had when I first played Wizardry 7 as a teenager.

My personal favorite being Might and Magic 6: The Mandate of Heaven. This game is more of a take of the earlier Might and Magic games (Clouds / Darkside of Xeen). Although it pays homage to Might and Magic through gameplay, most of the familiarity ends there. That's not to say, however, that I didn't really enjoy this game.\n\nCombat is turn-based. Character customization leaves something to be desired. The classes are unbalanced and vaguely described, you won't really know what the classes are capable of until much later in the game; and by then it's too late and you'll be stuck with a couple of characters that are far less capable/effective as others, so I recommend doing some google-research on the class-combos before going all in.\n\nIf you have never tried the Legend of Grimrock series, I would buy those first, as I think they offer a better tribute to the genre.\n\nIt's a fun throwback to the grid-system, dungeon crawler RPG. If you can get it on sale and you're an oldschool PCRPG'er, then I would recommend this game to you.","May 5, 2015","true","12.9"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

After hearing that they were going to try and create M&M 10 with a retro feel I was hoping that they would rekindle some of the spark that M&M 1 – M&M 8 had.\n\nUnfortunately, this had been another disappointment due to poor and confusing combat/spell systems, character development that is quite unforgiving and leaves me feeling that choice is an illusion and to get anywhere in the game you need a specific build of character.\n\nI felt the limiting of classes to race and the extremely limited choice in character appearance was unnecessary and made the options you had to build a unique character even more obvious. The story telling had been weak and had not been focused on delivering short, clear and easy to follow story line.\n\nI struggle to find any saving graces for the series, except the desire to continue the series.

I also love any game where I can create my own party and try to make their unique skills work together into a harmonious vision. Also I love exploration. Also dungeon-crawling, especially the type that rewards searching walls and floors for traps and other dangerous things.\n\nMight and Magic X - Legacy contains all those things.\n\nDon't buy it.\n\nIt's like everything I like about the genre has been taken, then subverted to make it ♥♥♥♥♥♥.\n\nThere is a turn-based system, but the turn-based movement ceases to work when in combat. There is no maneuvering once enemies are in melee range. You can never take a tactical withdrawl or move to bottleneck your foes. There is no party formation, so your characters stand in a line up front. This is not Grimrock, where the people at the back of your party are mostly vulnerable to attacks from foes that have specifically flanked you. This is Might and Magic, where your unarmored mages hurl themselves in front of every stray arrow or blade they can find, as though their torso posessed by the ghost of a weapon collector.\n\nYou can, however, make your own party. I meticulously used all four available races (Orc, Human, Dwarf and Elf) to make what I thought was a balanced party that would have unique skills that complemented each other. A true adventuring party, if you will. It turns out what I wanted basically didn't matter, because the level of party customization in the game is basically like paint over a piece of cardboard. There are 'classes', but they just determine how far your skills can advance, which has no bearing on the early game. They have 'advanced classes' that are unlocked at some point, but just one per class, so really it's just the inevitable progression of your class' skills. No class starts with a special ability that makes it unique. Only advanced classes get those. So your Mercenary (a might-based fighter) that's dabbling in Air Magic is -just as good at it- as the fully-specialized Freemage. Wait, you say that the Freemage is more heavily invested in the Magic attribute and is better with magic? Yeah, 8% better at the start. Hot stuff. That might increase by a whole 8% per level, too! All the while you're completely neglecting your mage's ability to stay alive by investing in Vitality or Perception, so really it's closer to 2% per level.\n\nBasically your meticulously planned party is going to be ineffective, because the game doesn't really want you to experiment with the parts of the skill system that you like. Want to invest in Warfare (a fighter's equivalent to casting spells) and have a battlefield commander? ♥♥♥♥ you. Now your fighter can't hit anything to save his life, and you need to land your Challenge attacks to draw the attention of enemies, who will then proceed to mangle your fighter that didn't invest heavily in their armor skills.\n\nBasically there are no good decisions, and that seems to be how the game likes it.\n\nMonster fighting is tiresome. The earliest quests have you dealing with spiders that poison you with their basic attacks. Poison never goes away without a (fairly expensive) antidote or specific spell that nobody can start with. So any of your characters that get poisoned by this frequent attack will inevitably go 'unconscious' without immediate medical attention. Being unconscious doesn't clear the poison. The poison is eternal. My Dwarf Defender didn't recover from poison after resting for twenty-four hours. Or ever. Not without help. So 'camping' to tend to your wounds just refills your health bars and then you watch them rapidly deteriorate from the poison that never disappeared. It takes about six 'steps' in game for people to keel over dead after getting up from their nap.\n\nWhat.\n\nMonsters don't get any better. Naga in the second dungeon (the first after the 'tutorial' with the spiders) dual-wield and attack twice per turn, gaining more damage if they hit with the first swing. They regularly one-hit your spellcasters and cannot be provoked into attacking anyone wearing armor without spamming 'challenge' attempts, which costs mana and rarely lands. Naga priestesses spam ice spells just as strong as the party's, but don't suffer from mana conservation. Everything crits. You guzzle mana and health potions every three rounds. I don't want to say 'unrealistic' when talking about my fantasy dungeon crawlers, but my god...\n\nI don't even...\n\nI hate to compare this game to Grimrock (which was brilliant), because it doesn't feel fair. Grimrock was a labor of love for people that love this genre. Legacy was a kick in the nuts trying to cash in on nostalgia with a low price tag and promises it doesn't deliver on. Exploring dungeons doesn't have player attentiveness rewarded by secret passages and vast loot. Instead, your characters bark out their discovery of things, waiting for you to mash your face against every nearby wall until something glows and you open a new passage with the spacebar.\n\nRiveting.\n\nTraps are mandatory. Often they just sit on a required pathway, and almost always just spawn more monsters. Usually in flanking positions. Even if you detect a trap your only choice is to mash your face into it, or, in rare circumstances, walk around the otherwise empty room.\n\nLoot is a mess of +2 to damage and +5 to some nebulous resistence stats. It's also completely random and there's no such thing as farming, so if the wrong loot drops for your party...♥♥♥♥ you. I guess you can reload, save-scumming for better loot, but is that something we really want to encourage?\n\nI've been told the game opens up, both in terms of exploration and tactics, but after my first party (which I was a fool to put on the harder of the two difficulties, which made it nearly unplayable) couldn't pass the second dungeon, I don't think I'm going to make it there. My second party has the exact same problem in the exact same dungeon, you see. On the 'much easier' difficulty.\n\nDevelopers and veterans will probably giggle because someone can't handle their hardcore game. Their perogative. I'm still not going to reccomend this steaming mess to anyone.\n\nSlow, unsatisfying, tiresome. Avoid it.","February 14, 2014","false","5.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","1"

Nice locations, interesting foes, pretty decent combat and character mechanics.\n\nOne thing they seriously need to adjust / change is how poison works. There are way too many dungeons with poison attack enemies and getting poisoned without potions means death because resting doesn't really heal you from it and you don't have cure spells in the beginning. Antidote potions were easy to come by in the first dungeon as the enemies occasionally dropped them, but in later dungeon you have ranged poison enemies (that also cause poison with melee) and no source of anything to cure it with. A bit frustrating.\n\nedit: Apparently you can get cure poison spell with novice level earth magic, but point still stands that poison is really annoying and way too frequent effect in the beginning.\n\nI do recommend this game though!

No bugs so far.  Running smooth enough. I had a bit of lag at a bridge outside but no where else.\nFew thingts are different from the older games .  You level on the spot instead of training for example\nCombat is faster then early access from what I can tell from posts on the forum(was deemed to slow).\nI am playing in warrior mode; not finding it too hard so far, playing with default party..  Button mashing will just get you killed.   You have to put some thought into combat.  you can blow enemy back with one char then root it with other for example witch I found cool.\n\nYou get out into open world pretty fast and no restrictions as where you can go apart from places were you need water walking etc.  Similar to earlier games.\n\nSome items have exact same name but different stats wich can be annoying slightly.\nCan see enemies but can't just attack em, got to get close enough to trigger battle.  I presume this is intentional.\nMap could be a bit better so don't have to hover over everything to see whats there; adding note didn't help still had to hover over icons.\nI see these as minor gripes and don't really take away from my enjoyment.\n\nI am glad I purchased game so far and would recommend if you're into the older titles and games like legend of Grimlock, Realms of Arkania remake (it is in a very playable state after many patches)\nI got a good feeling that I am going to enjoy this and was money well spent so far.\n\nUpdate:\nHad to strart again because enemies don't respawn and you can run out of money quite easily.\nIn the first act I found that you can't just do quests in any order because you get wasted.  I had done all outside mobs except for w*****  and got to boss in tower.  I just can't survive long enough because I used me potions up and no way to get gold.  So I can't last it out using hp regen.  Thats the only mob left in act one plus 2 wraiths.  Can't do them either cause need something that can't afford.\nI still recommend game but you can quite easily make wrong choices that can basically make it game over.  Respawning enemies would give the option to grind a bit if you did not chose the skills, spells to succeed.\n\nI get were people are coming from when they say it feels like its a bit on rails.  Hope act 2 dosen't give me same feeling.  This is in warrior mode default party.  Don't wanrt to play adventurer mode because people say too easy; can just button mash.\n\nUpdate: With better planning I managed to finish act 1 with no problems at all; with default party on warrior mode.  I've managed to cross the bridge.  Enjoying myself a lot more second time round.  Now I have a better idea of howto make sure I don't end up getting stuffed because I didn't get some must have spells.  I rest now instead of drinking potions during fights.","January 23, 2014","true","7.7"," 18 of 34 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","18","34","0","1"

January 2014 (5 days after release -expect some bugs to get fixed later on)\nwill add to the review after the release of the first dlc\n\nAllrighty, first things first, for those that are curious : this game is not worth the money, it was a massive disappointment for me after spending years waiting for a new might and magic and overall it just feels like a downgraded version of legend of grimrock - the only upgrade being the price of the game - i will go into details below.\nAlso note that you have to use Uplay to start MMX\n\n---General Stuff---\n\nSettings used : 1600x900 windowed, everything set to high\n\n- Game crashes a lot, for me it averaged around 1 crash per hour, sometimes crashing more frequently, sometimes less, depending on where you are in the game. (crashes more frequently at night)\n- Huge FPS drops, even bigger at nighttime or when using teleporters. MMX goes down to like 1-5 FPS and apparently tries to reload all the trees and other objects in front of you, there are tons of people with that problem in the Ubisoft forums, so it is related to the game, not computer specs (my computer can handle all new games anyways)\n- Annoying loading times, when loading savegames or quickloading. Can take up to 30 seconds when transitioning in and out of dungeons. (this is most fun when you are trying to navigate the optional dungeon with instant kill traps, leading to a quickload if you make a wrong move)\n\nThese three points alone ruined the game for me, because it feels like trying to play skyrim on a pentium 3.\nBut let's also take a look at some of the games "Key Features" from the store page.\n\nOpen world\nTravel through stunning environments, choose which region you want to explore first but be careful, danger is never far off.\n- This is pretty misleading. Most areas are sealed off at the start and have to be opened with quest items from main quests. for example you can only access around 20% of the world before completing Act 1, around half of the areas can't be accessed before you have the swimming and teleporting abilities.\nAlso, most of the areas accessible are "sealed off" by monsters, so if your level is too low, you can not get past them (example : cursed ruin spectres, blackguard mages before karthal), which leads to the area also being inaccessible until you made some level progress via main quest. This makes the game feel rather linear, you can only explore freely if you are nearly done with Act 3 (aka 75% of the game) but at that point you have been to most areas anyways thanks to the main quest.\n\nVarious quests\nDiscover the sinister plot happening in the Agyn Peninsula, shape its inhabitants' stories, and evolve your party thanks to fun and original quests full of Easter Eggs!\n- The game has a variety of quests, sure. But are they "fun and original"? Not really. About 80% of the quests are your basic stuff, "get item xy", "bring item xy to person xy", "escort person xy to location xy", "visit dungeon xy". The rest of the quests is pretty fun though, especially the more puzzle related, for example getting asked questions about various locations in the game by a guard (you have to input the answers on your own, no multiple choice) was a neat quest.\n\n20+ dungeons\nExperience fear and claustrophobia in the dark heart of classic dungeons, and feel vulnerable to attack from all sides while crossing open landscapes.\n- While this is true, they forgot to add the fact that around half of those dungeons only consist of a single room with a single monster guarding a single chest. Most of the other dungeons are pretty generic, however there are also some exceptions, like the Enigma Tower or the Tomb of Terrors that are really well made and fun.\n\nMore than 60 creatures and 6 unique bosses\nFace cunning foes in turn-based combat and adapt your fighting skills to the mightiest creatures.\n- The ingame Beastiary shows that there are around 140 enemies in total in the game (i only found 130 by visiting every location in the game, so the rest is probably for the upcoming dlc) which sounds like a good amount of enemies. However, the developers counted every single variation of those enemies as a new creature. Lets take an example to make it more clear. Throughout the game you will fight a variety of Humans, of which there are also some swordsman. In the beginning you fight against Militia(1) and Elite Militia(2), afterwards against Militia Captain(3), Elite Militia Captain(4), and even later against Black Guard(5), Elite Black Guard(6), Black Guard Captain(7) and Elite Black Guard Captain(8). They all look the same and have the same abilities, only difference are the health, attack and defense stats, but the game counts them as 8 different creatures, so you can imagine how many "different" enemies you will have to face. Bosses are no exception, most of them just look like random normal enemies with a red name (Luke for example looks exactly like a Militia)\n\nMODDING KIT\nCreate your own map and mods to express yourself, design the game you want to play and share your creative vision with the Might & Magic X – Legacy community!\n- Here they just forgot the most important information : to use the ModKit you have to buy Unity3D which comes at the small price of 1500$\n\n\n---Gameplay---\n\nThe Difficulty Level of the game is extremely broken.\nThe beginning of the game is challenging and somewhat luck based, with crits being able to oneshot mages and rangers, with you not being able to cure crowd controls reliably and with enemies dodging and blocking like there is no tomorrow.\nOfcourse this also depends a lot on your party composition, but it gets easier after some level ups. In fact, if you have a healer - especially the druid - and just max out his heal (earth magic) everything becomes a piece of cake.\nWith both of the druids healing spells healing you for absurd amounts every turn, for 4 turns, you can take on as many enemies as you want, even the final boss can't do ♥♥♥♥. This is just one of the balance flaws that the game offers.\nDon't have a fire mage? Well ♥♥♥♥ you, this boss will paralyse you and only fire magic can cure it in the early stages of the game. Don't have a dark magician? Well ♥♥♥♥ you again, you are not gonna find secrets because only dark magic can detect those. (you can buy scrolls for that, but they only last 50 turns and are rather expensive early on) Have an archer? Well ♥♥♥♥ you as much as you want, but the bow is absolutely useless in this game, since enemies will just spawn in melee range every time. Good thing you can also skill daggers on an archer. Oh, daggers are the most broken weapon in the game, being able to dual wield them and getting 3 attacks per turn per dagger will 2 or 3 shot every boss later in the game when you have elemental daggers.\ntl;dr = Difficulty level and class balancing is terrible\nAlso Side Note : You can sometimes even accept quests a second time after doing them, yup nice bug. example : get a doctor from village a to village b, afterwards get him some reagents to fix someone up. quest done. go to his house in village a, woops suddenly he is here again, giving you the same escort mission again.\n\n---Story---\n\nThe Story could not be more casual (spoiler ahead) A guy helps you when you arrive at the peninsula and later on it will go like ermahgerd, plot twist, he is a demon and the final boss of the game\nThere is basically no character development, they all feel like puppets saying the same ♥♥♥♥ over and over again,so you will probably stop caring about the story after the first act.\n\n---Rest of the Review---\n\nCharacter limit has been reached, so if you want to read the rest of the review, going into detail about Atmosphere, Sound, Graphics and Gamesize follow this link to pastebin : http://pastebin.com/CL4DnM35","January 28, 2014","false","63.9"," 21 of 40 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","21","40","0","2"

Legacy follows suit and provides hours of singleplayer entertainment that many RPG fans will likely enjoy. While anyone trying out grid-based rpgs first time should try the cheaper and more polished Grimrock first, Legacy will scratch that RPG itch whenever it comes up. If its too much for you now, save it to your wishlist for a future sale.\n\nLegacy's combat and character management is where the game really shines. Many of the toughest boss fights are challenging, unique and provide a great sense of accomplishment after bringing them down. You might find yourself reloading a save once or twice as you figure out a bosses mechanics. Even the common enemies can't be taken down with just basic attacks and rightfully punishes players who underestimate their foe. Large variety in classes and skills makes every character level up feel meaningful and potent as you mold your party into your own. You'll find yourself using nearly every skill you acquire, from minor spells like Light Orb or Fire Ward to the warfare skills of your melee classes to powerful grandmaster spells like Thunderstorm. The default party offers a great balance to different playstyles, but there are so many different class/racial combinations its worth building your own unique party, especially if you plan to only make one playthrough.\n\nDifferent scenery and enemies throughout the game offers much needed variety, which the Legend of Grimrock lacks. Dungeons are engaging, fun and filled with secrets; which are found with a perception check rather than the players own cunning and discovery. That said, the developers have wisely taken many of the games puzzles and placed them in "mysterious crypts" dotted around the map, rather than amongst the major quests which could serve to only slow the pacing. Even than, the crypts offer excellent items worth trying to get, but by no means necessary to complete the game. Storyline is your typical fanasty affair with an unseen villian who needs stopping, but interesting enough to provide some entertainment.\n\nFantastic RPG specific qualities aside, you will find some pretty horrid textures within the game. Even after changing the options from the main menu (a MUST), the game was filled with some objects and characters that are something you'd expect from 2003. Most of these seem to come from the unit models brought in from Might and Magic Heroes VI, which were likely not optimized or polished for upclose inspection. On the other hand, some charecters are quite detailed. It seems that Ubisoft has tried to spend as little as possible on this title and the wide margin in texture quality shows as a result. I myself have run into a graphic glitch where most of the world area's cities and castles disappeared from view, resulting in me wasting a good 15 minutes trying to find a particular castle, until I figured out what had happened. Thankfully a simple game restart solved the problem. Judging by the forums there are other graphics glitches and some quest breaking bugs, though I haven't run into them myself.\n\nMany of the quests also lack enough description which might leave you trying to figure out what exactly your looking for. World map is also painfully simple, providing markers for only the most important cities and main dungeons, yet neglecting to identify individual sections of the map which are often given as your only clue about where to go for a certain quest. You'll also need a pen or pencil once or twice as your party seems to have none of their own for a couple critical details.\n\nMight and Magic: Legacy X is a fun addition to grid-based RPGs and I felt was worth the $25, which I luckly didn't have to spend due to the recent Ubisoft sale, though others might consider it too much at its current price. However, it is definitely worth keeping on your wishlist for an appropriate sale or price drop. Those who haven't picked up cheaper RPGs (especially Grimrock) should get those first before putting money in this new title.","February 26, 2014","true","30.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/probo_/recommended/238750/","probo_","probo_","http://steamcommunity.com/id/probo_/","100 products in account","Review of Might and Magic X: Legacy\n\nWhat must first be said is that this is not going to be your average run of the mill rpg, the designers of this game has made it a somewhat old-school type game, and what that means is that the game will not hold your hand and lead you through it. This can be surprising and frustrating as you sometimes wander around aimlessly, having possibly missed some small detail that means that you are now on the wrong path. Since the name of the game is indeed 'Legacy', maybe we should have come to expect this and be completely ok with it, but I think it still needs to be said that the lack of descriptions of where to go in this game can be a problem. This problem can be more or less immediately rectified however, as long as you are willing to alt tab from the game to google, which is something that I personally ended up doing multiple times, even though I would consider myself somewhat of a veteran gamer.\n\nThe main plot of the game is convoluted, as it should be (follows the traditions of the older games), and there is a relatively little emphasis on story, as it should be. Most of what you do in the game is exploring, and fighting. Many npc's however have the option to spill some minor 'gossip' to the player, which is most of the time just random bits of lore of the gameworld. Scattered throughout the world is also many books, which holds a lot of lore of the world, if this is your thing.\n\nThe characters your party is comprised of are created manually by the player (unless you insist on letting the computer do it for you), and they all have lots of attribute points and skills that needs to be allocated. There is a nice range of depth to the character building in this game, as the 12 classes available all have different levels of potential with different skills. The mage characters can usually level up certain magic skills to the highest level (grandmaster), but also has the potential of leveling up certain weapon skills, armor skills, and passive defense skills. This well functioning skill system works together with your attribute system to give the player quite a lot of customization options for his party. It essentially *succeeds* in making the player feel like they are the one who created this team, as opposed to having few options and feeling like you are playing a non-rpg. The games skill and attribute system is sufficient, and well expected as it follows the traditions of the older Might and Magic titles. But that doesn't mean that it is fresh, or innovative. It also isn't balanced very well. The armor skills are shown to be very lackluster once you understand the games mechanics for example.\n\nThe game is entirely grid based. This is a design choice that has huge implications for gameplay, but it is an intrinsic part of the experience, and there is nothing to be done about it now. The entire game is built around this, and as such the environments of the game has the probability of looking quite odd and unrealistic, if you compare it to Skyrim for example. The world is also quite small, it would only take about 3 minutes to run through the length of the entire overworld map (once you have killed all the enemies, and opened everything). This is not because the game is small or short, but because of how compressed everything is, but this is a good thing most of the time, as otherwise there would have been an enormous amount of walking for you - that's a promise. The way the dungeons are built in this game screams 'gameplay' over 'realism', and thankfully so. Maybe it doesn't make any sense that the governor of a peninsula is living in a castle that effectively looks like a labyrinth? But it makes for fun adventuring, so I am pleased.\n\nThe main focus of the game could be said to be fighting, and fighting is done in a turn based tactical manner. You get to make one action with each of your characters during your turn, such as casting spells or attacking with weapons, (but this hardly has to be said I hope). You will encounter many enemies that will give you a run for your money, and I hope you will welcome the challenge. There has been a couple of posts both on Steam and on Ubisofts forum of players complaining about not being able to progress because their party is too weak. There is the hypothetical possibility that you might gimp your characters to the point of not being able to continue. But one must understand that this is a necessity in a game if you want freedom for the player to design their own party in meaningful ways, and still pose a challenge.\n\nFinally, the game is produced by Ubisoft and requires Uplay to play, which can be a detriment, as most people don't want Uplay to clog up their computer as the millionth "gamehub service" program. Having popups that try to direct you to Youtube every time you exit the game is hardly a plus either, but that's something that Ubisoft thinks is a cool thing.\n\nScore is a whopping 85/100 for me personally. It's the perfect blend between rpg and strategy, and will probably leave you with a feeling of satisfaction if you are a min-maxing geek like myself. But you have to look past some of the things mentioned earlier in my text to get the most out of it.","April 24, 2014","true","240.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

What is wrong with it? And what is right with it?  Well.. currently, I am engaging in a full playthrough.  In my first 30 minutes, I discovered that the game seems to require MUCH more system resources than it should for the type of game you are playing.  The game also seems to take several steps BACKWARDS!! in regards to the progress that has been made in the dungeon Crawler genre of games.  It makes a sort of Dated, modern take on a familiar genre that has had leaps and bounds of progress made, 10 years ago.\n\nIt may get better later... but currently, it clearely shows dated mechanics that I would have expected a company like Ubisoft to invest in improving (IE full voice overs, a fully explorable world) if they actually believed in the project.\n\nCurrently, SOME of the main quest givers actually speak, and the game moves in a old school (and I mean super old school) grid method which is dated even for the 90s.  The game runs poorly which is honestly unforgiveable.  And last but not least, it just seems limiting in regards to the way you make your party.  That last one is a minor gripe, but I am in a nit picky mood at the time of this review.\n\nSo what does the game do right?  Well, currently it seems very balanced, and the game is full of lore if you do not mind reading.  The story ties in with a familiar world (thus far) if you have been paying attention to the previous games in the series, and even comes with several nods to those games.  It isn't a terrible game, it could have been much worse, and the game is most certainly playable.  It seems balanced (at the time of the review) and I have yet to encounter a real problem space that I simply could not finish.  I will complain though, that I have yet to discover a way to flee a combat.  Which I find to be in poor taste... there is simply no way I have found to disengage from a fight once something closes the distance etoo you.  So I would suggest to be VERY careful.  Makes you think actually, which is a good thing in a manner of speaking.  Unfortunately, some fights you will not know you can't deal with until you start the fight, so save often.\n\nis the game worth getting?  Currently, I am totally torn.  The super fan of this genre is willing to accept even a mediocre title, and invest.  The game itself is not above 30 dollars in charge, but at the same time I am torn to say that you should wait till it goes on sale before picking it up.  Why get a game from a big company, when you can get a great game from a smaller indie company... (go get legend of Grimmrock)  If you are a true blue fan of might and magic, and you want another dungeon crawl to add to your list, then by all means, the game is not unplayably bad.  But just understand, that you are supporting what seems to me, like a cash cow attempt to milk the might and magic license from your friends at Ubi-soft.\n\nIf the late game is terrible, then I will add to the review, if it is good, I will also add to the review later.  Till then, I will, sort of recommend this game to folks.  Just watch my vids and see if you like what you get.","August 21, 2013","false","22.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

And it's turn based. And has grid based movement. And is in first person. I had to do a double take, too, after that announcement. Although we had some Japanese games carry on the torch of such RPGs (Etrian Odyssey, Wizardry: Labyrinth of Lost Souls etc.) in recent years, they were fairly combat focused and simple.\n\nThis here is the real deal. It has (light) puzzles, lore in the form of books, an expansive overworld and multiple cities with shops, NPCs and quests. Character generation and development has a lot of options and you have to make hard choices because there are a lot more skills to develop than there are skill points.\n\nThe game has two difficulty modes and I played on the easier setting. I think I made the right choice as I felt the challenge was always so that I had to pay attention to enemy weaknesses and positioning but was never totally outmatched besides a few badly balanced battles. Oftentimes, in these "new old school" games, you have to go straight to a higher difficulty to get a decent challenge but this just felt right. The game loves to ambush your party from all sides with no escape possible so I think this could get frustrating in a higher difficulty quickly.\n\nThe main satisfaction in these kind of games comes from getting loot, killing monsters, developing your characters and exploring new areas. I think the game absolutely delivers in these aspects, I almost never was bored in my 40 hours which it took me to beat the game with most sidequests done.\n\nThe graphics are nice and adequate for the budget they probably had but the performance could be better. Loading times are fairly long, too, for 2013 mid-range game computer hardware with an SSD.\n\nI would welcome a Might & Magic XI after this successful revival of an old franchise.","March 6, 2014","true","40.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Similar in gameplay to some of the previous Might and Magic games as well as Legend of Grimrock.  Unlike Grimrock, you may be locked to a grid, but it isn't a click-fest.  Character skills are are turn-based, and it allows more of a relaxed progression on the game.  I have a toddler and a five year old, and I appreciate a game that doesn't punish me for having to split my attention.\n\nThe challenge level is good.

Not quite up to the (rose tinted) M&M 6, this release is more in the vein of M&M 3 or 4; the old school charm is a welcome change of pace from “modern” RPG’s, and a reminder of how solid these games used to be. The only thing that could use further tweaking is the difficulty… Adventurer mode is too easy, while Warrior mode can be too unforgiving, especially in the early game. My advice is to play on Warrior mode, but read a class guide beforehand, as it is too easy to create a party and build that can’t progress in Act 2.\n\nLegacy is a bit rough around the edges, but if you are a fan of Might & Magic, or RPG’s in general, this one is well worth your time!","March 22, 2014","true","73.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I'm a die-hard fan of Might and Magic VI, which I've gone back and played several times over the years. This installment lacks the scope of VI, but captures the spirit of it.\n\nPlanning and developing your party is the main highlight, despite a few minor issues with how skills are distributed across classes. Although there are party combinations that are clearly "better" if you are optimizing, there are lots of possibilities that are doable and fun, even by just using different skill distributions amongst the same classes.\n\nYou have to accept that you can't get everything you want on every character or every party, since there is an effective limit on the experience you can gain in the game. This can be frustrating, but forces you build more intelligently and make sacrifices to get the skills you want. The game itself is somewhat linear and lacking in the open-world feel of other Might and Magic games. The story isn't very deep or compelling, similar to Heroes VI.\n\nThe grid movement and turn-based combat are off-putting at first, but they ultimately created interesting opportunities for tactical gameplay. Combats are often repetitive although there are some variations in tactics based on the specific enemies. After beating it on the normal difficulty, I immediately played through again with a new party on the "Warrior" difficulty, which provided a fun challenge that felt like a different game, at least in the early going. Even after beating it again, I still find myself brainstorming different party combinations I want to try.\n\nOverall, not an "amazing" game, but quite enjoyable, with good replayability. Certainly better than the average review indicates. Now I'm primed to go back and play VI again.\n\n\n","January 12","true","104.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Turn based combat. Good for a relaxing game of nostaligic party based monster bashing, leveling, and loot collecting if you are into that kind of thing. I finally made it to act 2 on my 7th try playing hardcore mode (meaning I start over on a total party kill.).\n\nIt is a difficult, unforgiving game (at least on warrior mode). It won't hold your hand or give you quest arrows to follow. That is a quite refreshing change, having to explore and find things rather than mindlessly being spoon fed content.\n\nAfter investing several hours, I began to realize that this game is VERY hard to beat, especially if you like to play hardcore mode, and blind without knowledge of the game. It's not possible to retreat unless you use a very specific obscure party build. So to play this hardcore you almost need to be spoiled in advance. So for the record I still think it's a great game, but it can't scratch that Dead is Dead game itch without some serious tweaking for me.","January 29","true","15.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Only uses the first card, and will pretty much peg it most of the game (bug). But the game is fun, and captures the original feel of might and magic 3-5.  The game is pretty well balances, difficult but most party combinations have a way to beat it. The Falchon and the Unicorn is very difficult, I got through the jail to the palace courtyard. after 100+ attempts I finally modded my archemage (which was healer/area dps) ac by 25, and vitality by 20 through gear  modifications. I also increased my warmongers ac by 25. This kept my whole party from being one hit and allowed my only healer to resurrect. I still had quite a challenge to get to the end, but at least it wasnt impossible. I am sure there are party and gear combinations that make it beatable but when you face 20+ enemies all capable of one shot kills (with several that can 1 shot party kill), with facing 6 at a time, it is very little odds that you will get lucky enough to survive. The one time I did, I had to reload because I couldn't resurrect my party.  If you mod start small, even 10% might be enough to make the difference.  I recommend it, its a fun old school rpg, but only if you like extreme challenges tackle falchon and the unicorn (or opt for some mods) don't mod before the dlc, it will ruin your whole experience the main game is well balanced.","July 6, 2014","true","114.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

At first I was slow to succumb to its charms.  I felt the controls and immersion were a little clumsy, the voices and sound effects cheesy at best, and the visuals less than stellar.  When I got to the heart of the game, however, all of those things faded to the background and I found a lot to enjoy in the party building, monster smashing, and exploration.  I encourage newcomers to begin with an open mind and to be prepared to invest some solid time with a trial party to get acquainted with the mechanics and to learn what works well and what doesn't. Then once you have a vision and some goals it makes the challenges in front of you - and your progress - much more rewarding and motivating.\n\nI'm enjoying mysecond playthrough even more, this time using my knowledge of trainer and gear availability, what works best in combat and what doesn't, and an understanding of the pacing of the game to make a challenging party that beats the odds.  What's more, the game is deliberately set up to prevent you from trying all of the skills and classes in one go.  At first this frustrated me; now I appreciate the built-in replay.  A tip on that note: Don't try to do it all, do just a few things really well, and then try a different mix in another playthrough.","March 21, 2014","true","84.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Especially for fans of the series it will be big irritating shock to suddenly find this game to have tile-based movements, which at least in my opinion limits the world, that is open to one, massively. (This world feels a lot smaller than the ones we had in the last games!) Now again this is at first terribly annoying, but as the time goes on, one eventually starts to live over that movement system. However the part about going on can become a bit problematic.\nEven now, after the game has left Steam Early Access, it's still terribly unbalanced to play and it definitely isn't unusual to experience multiple crashes. And apperantly that isn't something that's dependent on having a high-end PC or not, since it might play just fine on my old laptop for several hours and on my Tower-PC it crashes every 15 minutes or vise versa. To counter that I've made it a habit of mine to quick-save almost every 10 steps and after every fight.\n\nThe fact that they included several (actually many) references to the previous Heroes games (which is logical since they're in the storyline of the series the most recent ones) is nice untill you start to get to the point where you're starting to realize that they just took most of the units from those Heroes games, kept their animation cycles, scaled and brushed them up a bit and then plastered them everywhere...\n\nThe story itself is fairly nicely written, eventhough I can see some minor mistakes or nonsense here and there. Again all in all the story that's being told is failry enjoyable. And since that's in fact the only thing that I've been interested in, in almost all the games of the series so far, I'll still recommend it, despite all the flaws I mentioned beforehand.","May 31, 2014","true","2.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

There are cases where if you want to run back to town, you will need to run through 4+ areas.  With movement and load times this can take easily five minutes.  Too make it even more annoying the loading of an area STOPS if the screen loses focus, so no alt-tabbing during a load time.\nThis is simply too immersion breaking.   There is a good chance you will hit a point where you have to run back to town realize this could easily involve five minutes to get there and then ANOTHER five minutes to get back.  If you’re the type of person who will drop this game and forget it with the above scenario don’t buy it.\n\n\nPros\nProbably the best combat system for a turn based RPG I’ve seen in a long time.\nMelee for example you have the three styles, duel-wield, shield and two-hander each one has situations where one is better.  A monster has the ability vindictive, for every miss on him he gets one more hit, which might damages your whole party.  Duel wielding dagger wielders with 4 attacks might get you killed if they miss too often one round, while a two handers one swing mass damage won’t cause a wipe.   Conversely a monster might be able to block the first swing against him 75% of the time, making the duel wielder at worst lose one attack and the two-hander do none.\nThe spells are just as varied and important as well with their effects frequently being more important than their damage.   Pushing a monster square away, putting a monster to sleep, reducing the number of attacks a monster gets, buffing the party, removing block attempts or armour from monsters, AoE spells, and many more effects.\nAlthough some fights do break down into a simple damage race, knowing what type of melee and spell to use and the correct order actually matters in this game.\n","March 9, 2014","false","30.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

It's very refreshing to play a challenging rpg and something  different from the current crop of modern action rpgs.  I first I was a little put off with the way the skill system worked, and it took me a few to get used to grid movement and the battles were tough.  Then I got engaged.  Instead of just brute forcing my way (which didnt work) I started to think a little more tactically, and began planning my battles, what spells I would use, how I would skill up and basically just think ahead. This game is about resource management, managing your mana, managing your potions and managing your gold as drops aren't as abundant as they are in other games.   So I started off thinking the game was ok, to, wow this is fantastic. And all it took was adjusting my mindset. My only gripes are that I wish there was a way to tactically withdraw from fights instead of being locked in, and I would have enjoyed a few monster respawns (once you clear an area it stays clear) so I could farm a little more xp and pad my cash balance and items a little more. I'm not overly fond of having to have uplay as well but it is not very intrusive.

At first I was slow to succumb to its charms.  I felt the controls and immersion were a little clumsy, the voices and sound effects cheesy at best, and the visuals less than stellar.  When I got to the heart of the game, however, all of those things faded to the background and I found a lot to enjoy in the party building, monster smashing, and exploration.  I encourage newcomers to begin with an open mind and to be prepared to invest some solid time with a trial party to get acquainted with the mechanics and to learn what works well and what doesn't. Then once you have a vision and some goals it makes the challenges in front of you - and your progress - much more rewarding and motivating.\n\nI'm enjoying mysecond playthrough even more, this time using my knowledge of trainer and gear availability, what works best in combat and what doesn't, and an understanding of the pacing of the game to make a challenging party that beats the odds.  What's more, the game is deliberately set up to prevent you from trying all of the skills and classes in one go.  At first this frustrated me; now I appreciate the built-in replay.  A tip on that note: Don't try to do it all, do just a few things really well, and then try a different mix in another playthrough.","March 21, 2014","true","84.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Only uses the first card, and will pretty much peg it most of the game (bug). But the game is fun, and captures the original feel of might and magic 3-5.  The game is pretty well balances, difficult but most party combinations have a way to beat it. The Falchon and the Unicorn is very difficult, I got through the jail to the palace courtyard. after 100+ attempts I finally modded my archemage (which was healer/area dps) ac by 25, and vitality by 20 through gear  modifications. I also increased my warmongers ac by 25. This kept my whole party from being one hit and allowed my only healer to resurrect. I still had quite a challenge to get to the end, but at least it wasnt impossible. I am sure there are party and gear combinations that make it beatable but when you face 20+ enemies all capable of one shot kills (with several that can 1 shot party kill), with facing 6 at a time, it is very little odds that you will get lucky enough to survive. The one time I did, I had to reload because I couldn't resurrect my party.  If you mod start small, even 10% might be enough to make the difference.  I recommend it, its a fun old school rpg, but only if you like extreme challenges tackle falchon and the unicorn (or opt for some mods) don't mod before the dlc, it will ruin your whole experience the main game is well balanced.","July 6, 2014","true","114.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

But heck, this game has been known to be a low-cost production ever since it's been announced, so it makes no sense arguing over those now right?\n\nOverall it's not bad but not amazingly good either. But at the very least, it's still the long awaited sequel to the Might and Magic series!","January 23, 2014","true","14.1"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

If you get poisoned  then there seems to be only two things that will cure it, the antidote potion or death. And guess what? The first portion of the game is filled with spiders that poison you repeatedly in every single fight. So, a level one spider, can poison you and do what is effectively an endless amount of damage. You can use every single health potion that you have and the poison effect never wears off. If you run out of antidote potions in the first mission then you are are just screwed as far as I can tell.\n\nDo you want to make a unique character? How about a tough spear wielding druid? Well, if there is no spear in the shop then you  can't attack. You can cast your one staring spell two or three times and then your mana has run out and you stand there.\n\nMechanics are completely unexplained, as is leveling so are basic explanations of pretty much everything.

While the game is completly tile based, it does make you think about every step you end up taking, as it uses a turn. If you have a buff, do you want to move this direction or this direction, either way it uses up a point in the spell's duration. The graphics are pretty, although it can be a little laggy even on high end machines it isn't anything to start ranting about. If you are a fan of the older type of RPG's like this, you can even set the game to "retro mode" in the options and force the older feel pixels for the game. The game is filled with all sorts of journals giving insight to the world the game is set in. I personally sat down (breaks included of going to make a sandwich or something else more important at the moment) for a little over 3 hours to find the perfect type of class combination I wanted for my party. It is very important that you choose wisely. The game encourages you to explore the areas you are in and do not strictly require you to go from point A to point B. The way I see it is, take a shot at getting it. If you get the amout of hours in gameplay that you paid for it, then its worth the purchase. Try to avoid the ones that pick at the minor flaws and give it a bad rating.","January 23, 2014","true","85.9"," 10 of 19 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","10","19","0","0"

The developers took the best part of the game series, the sandbox element, and replaced it with a linear piece of junk.\n\nThere were three aspects of the game that I enjoyed, the riddles and/or puzzles, being able to gather most quest objects without having the quest active yet (it saved me a lot of running around and back-tracking), and the fallout-style epilogue for some of the completed quests, that I got after beating the game. It could have given me a little extra time to read them, but whatever.\n\nThat said, those are the only three elements of the game that I enjoyed and if I had to rate the game on a scale of one to ten, I'd say it'd rate a three with their inclusion.\n\nThe rest is just full of dross, I beat the game and started today on the Falcon and the Unicorn DLC. Got fed up when it just transported me to the dungeon and dumped all the stuff I had. Even if I would have gotten my things back by getting to the second level of said dungeon, the approach and how it handled the interaction does not make sense to me.\n\nHaving said all of this, I can forgive a lot if there is a good story included in a game.\n\nThe story given is a piece of crap. The more I think about diffent elements in it, the less it makes sense to me.\n\nIt is presented in such a way as to celebrate how humans can do anything, while slandering the names of two real-life angels according to the bible, and presenting the policy of the separation of church and state as something that is needed because the angels are the corrupt element in the government. This just doesn't make sense to me in a fictional world, where as far as I know every other supernatural being is given a made up name. Why go to the trouble of offending people who believe the two named angels are real beings in the real world, and one of which is described in the book of Daniel as the Great Prince who protects the Jews? The writer could have just as easily made up another name for these mortal non-angels as they are presented in the world.\n\nThere are other issues I have with the game, lots of them, but you don't need to hear general griping from me. Just suffice to say that my personal tastes find this game to be extremely lacking on several levels, despite looking forward to playing it since I heard that it was being made.\n\nSome may claim that I'm setting the bar too high, but I think it's high enough for an expectation of what to expect from a game calling itself 'Might+Magic x:Legacy' when the Wizardry series ended on an awesome note with Wizardry 8. I can play Wizardry 8 to this day and have an awesome time, but I can tell you all that I'm never touching this piece of crap again. Later! Time to play Wizardry 7, I want to see what I can do with a party starting W8 as allies of the other races...","June 29, 2015","false","103.9"," 15 of 29 people (52%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","52","15","29","2","0"

Steam is making an effort to fix the screw-up that Uplay caused; Might & Magic VI has already been made available for download as a separate download & the soundtrack became availabe for download after I got a response to my support ticket.  The DLC included in the package are still up in the air due to the fact that Uplay currently has Standard keys applied to our Uplay accounts, so the only way this is going to be resolved is if Steam gives us DLC keys for those when they are released so that we can apply them to our Uplay accounts.  Receiving a key for THE FALCON AND THE UNICORN should be easy enough, but THE DREAM SHARD DUNGEON doesn't actually state that it's DLC, so I somehow don't expect that we're going to be able to get this unless Uplay makes a special exception & provides Steam with keys for it considering they screwed us Steam customers over.  Considering Uplay's disgusting behavior to this whole situation since the beginning, I have to expect that this won't be happening.  If we're lucky, it will be released as DLC regardless since I don't see any other way we're going to get that content if not.\n\nUPDATE: Seems Ubi is playing the blame game in this matter. Anybody going to Ubisoft to get the status on their Uplay account corrected is getting turned away & told to go back to where they purchased it from. This only shows that Ubisoft is not willing to work with 3rd-party distributors & only gives me the impression that this may have been done on purpose. Worst part is I now have a Standard version of the key stuck on my Uplay account that Ubisoft won't even hear from users that didn't purchase the game directly from their store. I think I'm probably done with purchasing from Ubisoft at this point.  I was doing the same with Steam until I realized they are definitely making an effort to rectify this issue, so I ended that & will continue to purchase from Steam so long as games are not by other companies on my boycott list (EA, Blizzard & now Ubisoft if they keep playing this game).","January 24, 2014","false","0.9"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","7"

I played through and got to the end but it took a while. Save and save often. Your party make-up in the beginning makes a BIG difference in your survivability rate. Don't make any archers, bring someone that can take a lot of dmg, bring someone that can deal lots of dmg, make sure you have a good healer and have someone that can cast pretty much all the spells. You might have to try out a few combinations before you figure out what's best. If you like the Might and Magic series, you will dig this game. The only gripe is the class customization. I was hoping for a bit more than what was offered. Pretty much have to take it or leave it kinda classes. Make a good combination of classes and you can't go wrong. This game kinda reminds me of playing the older ones with the turn-based movement. The game looks great, but be prepared for a bit of a challenge until you get some levels.","October 30, 2014","true","29.7"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","7","14","0","0"

I've completed M&M6 about 10 times and rest of the games in the series at least 3 times each.\n\nKeeping that in mind, I didn't hesitate to buy a game from the franchise, which was though to be dead, and frankly is not appealing to the younger generation of players. It is a great gamble to publish a game like this and I thank Limbic and Ubisoft (which I actually don't like very much).\n\nHowever, accepting the reality of this game's probability of success for modern player base and the monetary resources devoted to the game are no doubt limited, the game feels very "incomplete" in every way.\n\nAs much as i can see on the internet, people ♥♥♥♥♥ about the grid based/turn based mechanics of the game. My personal problem however is not about it's mechanics but about it's setup. Game is considerably short (finished in 45 hours or so. In M&M 6 you can't even clear 3 cities and related regions/quests in that time) and game world is extremely small. Entirety of M&M X sums up to 2-3 regions in M&M 6, 7 or 8. Considering that M&M 6 had 12 regions and MASSIVE dungeons, M&M X is a huge disappointment in that regard.\n\nMy second problem with the game is the linearity story. M&M games always had that freedom feeling (not like the sandbox games like TES series of course) which allowed the player to go to Dragonsand at level 1 and instantly ♥♥♥♥♥ by 200 dragons in range.\n\nThe story itself in previous games also had a classic purpose of gathering up different factions against a common enemy, then going in solo to crash it. M&M X lacks this quest line too, as we are getting railroaded into a single minded purpose. In M&M 7 the light vs dark choice had a game changing effect, and less so in 8. M&M X doesn't have this story feature as it lacks any type of choice over the story.\n\nThere are also issues with the game mechanics themselves. The class promotions are almost useless to get (which were CRITICAL to have in previous games), and the lack of honorary promotion quests breaks some of the dungeons (like if you don't have a paladin in your party, you can't complete the quest about shantiri disc). Skills are restructured and the removal of most miscelenaous skills (like lockpick, merchant, armsmaster, disarm, repair, identify item, etc.) makes the game more combat oriented than before.\n\nOn the positive side of things, the setting of the game was done quite well with the "new" world of Ashan. After the failure of M&M 9 and it's poorly thought setting, M&M X used the story began with Heroes 6 quite well. Race specific classes were also a great idea and made the game replayable (for me at least)\n\nMy evaluation of the game in general comes down to these:\n- Very short story\n- VERY small game world\n- Too linear storyline and the lack of choice\n- Bugs (less than I expected actually)\n- Poor game engine performance\n+ Franchise connected backstory\n+ Large number of classes for replayability\n+ 4 player party system and turn based combat\n+ BEING A MIGHT AND MAGIC GAME\n\n7/10\n\n\n\nPS: If the game gets a few DLCs to make it longer (like twice longer or something) and add regions like a city from Irollan, a single location from Seven Cities and a city from neighbouring Unicorn Duchy my rating would go up to 7,5-8/10","August 19, 2013","true","87.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The combination of an intricate skill system and open world gameplay was addictive as hell. Fortunately this new installment in the series captures the same feeling that made those games great. In fact it even improves on many aspects. The first major difference is combat. Instead of being realtime/pausable, the combat is completely turn based. This makes battles much more about tactics then the previous might and magics. The skill system with masters and grandmasters makes a return along with class promotion quests. In fact, this game retains a lot of might and magic staples. Yes there is obelisks. Yes there are relics.\n\nDungeons are very well done. There are secrets and hidden passages that you must find. You cant just kill all the enemies to finish the dungeons/quests. Dungeons are large and there is even one that has multiple entries and exits that span a large part of the game world. You will find yourself returning to the different dungeons just to see if you missed anything. You will solve puzzles, find clues, and even discover elemental shards. There are about 7 shards in total and each time you find one, you embark on a quest and gain a new blessing. The blessing's allow you to cross water or cut through a forest or take portals.\n\nMight and Magic X can be difficult and even frustrating at times. The magic system is such that you gain new spells when you become an expert, master, or grandmaster. You will find yourself to weak to fight certain creatures until you get these new spells. Speaking of the spell system, there are 12 different classes spanning 4 different races. Each class has its own flavor and can specialize in certain skills. Once your class gets promoted, they even get special abilities. This was a great addition to the traditional Might and Magic class system.\n\nThe one downside to this game is that its not quite big enough. You can tell the developers didnt have the time or budget they needed to truly make an epic game. I believe this release was a sort of test to see how well itd do and if it does well, we can look foward to a epic Might and Magic XI. Although the game world is small, its still a fantastic game.","February 4, 2014","true","41.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","1"

Right. Not to be confused with the Heroes of Might and Magic series, which, went down the minute UbiSoft got the IP.\n\nThis game has it flaws, actually many flaws. I'll note some cons of the game;\n\n- No front and rear positions- Your heroes are all in the front rank, and can be targeted by the enemies, so you cannot defend your magic users. There are a few spells which take some of the damage, but not having front and rear ranks is a bit of a oversight.\n- No means of retreating- Sometimes you make a mistake and aggro the wrong enemies, once you are locked into combat you cannot move away. So if you bite off more than you can chew; just load a previous save and save you the trouble of fighting a lost battle.\n- The graphics are really below par. Ofcourse graphics are not the most important things in these sort of games, but 2014 would mean at least some more eye-candy would be welcome. The graphics are bland, doors and NPCs made as if they are from the nineties. The day and night cycle is good though, but overall the graphics are not 2014 like,\n- The levelling up is way too much fuss. You'd think when you level up you can select abilities and skills on one screen. Not in this game; Here you need to edit your stats in the inventory screen, close it, open the spellbook and select more skill points for weapon/spells/etc. skills. Very annoying.\n- The customisation options- Really, 4 races with only 2 head options for females and males? Three classes per race is way too few. Customisation is very, very disappointing.\n- The Dialogues- Dialogues are very boring; If you expect anything like Mass Effect think again. Not much options to answer, usually only 2 and the dialogues really don't draw you into the story.\n- The graphics sometimes don't render and there are slow-downs at certain parts. Bad graphical optimisation.\n\nI can go on, but I think you get a general idea. Does this game have no plusses? Sure, but the cons really have the upper hand. Wait for a few more patches which hopefully will change a lot while the game feels very rushed.\n\nI think hardcore fans of the Might and Magic series could get some fun out of this game, but people like me, who like the Eye of the Beholder series and Wizardry 8, really don't need to buy this. It is overpriced and under-par.

The combination of an intricate skill system and open world gameplay was addictive as hell. Fortunately this new installment in the series captures the same feeling that made those games great. In fact it even improves on many aspects. The first major difference is combat. Instead of being realtime/pausable, the combat is completely turn based. This makes battles much more about tactics then the previous might and magics. The skill system with masters and grandmasters makes a return along with class promotion quests. In fact, this game retains a lot of might and magic staples. Yes there is obelisks. Yes there are relics.\n\nDungeons are very well done. There are secrets and hidden passages that you must find. You cant just kill all the enemies to finish the dungeons/quests. Dungeons are large and there is even one that has multiple entries and exits that span a large part of the game world. You will find yourself returning to the different dungeons just to see if you missed anything. You will solve puzzles, find clues, and even discover elemental shards. There are about 7 shards in total and each time you find one, you embark on a quest and gain a new blessing. The blessing's allow you to cross water or cut through a forest or take portals.\n\nMight and Magic X can be difficult and even frustrating at times. The magic system is such that you gain new spells when you become an expert, master, or grandmaster. You will find yourself to weak to fight certain creatures until you get these new spells. Speaking of the spell system, there are 12 different classes spanning 4 different races. Each class has its own flavor and can specialize in certain skills. Once your class gets promoted, they even get special abilities. This was a great addition to the traditional Might and Magic class system.\n\nThe one downside to this game is that its not quite big enough. You can tell the developers didnt have the time or budget they needed to truly make an epic game. I believe this release was a sort of test to see how well itd do and if it does well, we can look foward to a epic Might and Magic XI. Although the game world is small, its still a fantastic game.","February 4, 2014","true","41.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","1"

Right. Not to be confused with the Heroes of Might and Magic series, which, went down the minute UbiSoft got the IP.\n\nThis game has it flaws, actually many flaws. I'll note some cons of the game;\n\n- No front and rear positions- Your heroes are all in the front rank, and can be targeted by the enemies, so you cannot defend your magic users. There are a few spells which take some of the damage, but not having front and rear ranks is a bit of a oversight.\n- No means of retreating- Sometimes you make a mistake and aggro the wrong enemies, once you are locked into combat you cannot move away. So if you bite off more than you can chew; just load a previous save and save you the trouble of fighting a lost battle.\n- The graphics are really below par. Ofcourse graphics are not the most important things in these sort of games, but 2014 would mean at least some more eye-candy would be welcome. The graphics are bland, doors and NPCs made as if they are from the nineties. The day and night cycle is good though, but overall the graphics are not 2014 like,\n- The levelling up is way too much fuss. You'd think when you level up you can select abilities and skills on one screen. Not in this game; Here you need to edit your stats in the inventory screen, close it, open the spellbook and select more skill points for weapon/spells/etc. skills. Very annoying.\n- The customisation options- Really, 4 races with only 2 head options for females and males? Three classes per race is way too few. Customisation is very, very disappointing.\n- The Dialogues- Dialogues are very boring; If you expect anything like Mass Effect think again. Not much options to answer, usually only 2 and the dialogues really don't draw you into the story.\n- The graphics sometimes don't render and there are slow-downs at certain parts. Bad graphical optimisation.\n\nI can go on, but I think you get a general idea. Does this game have no plusses? Sure, but the cons really have the upper hand. Wait for a few more patches which hopefully will change a lot while the game feels very rushed.\n\nI think hardcore fans of the Might and Magic series could get some fun out of this game, but people like me, who like the Eye of the Beholder series and Wizardry 8, really don't need to buy this. It is overpriced and under-par. It tries to mimick the RPGs of old and fails.\n\nShame really while it had potential to become a great game.","January 26, 2014","false","7.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

This issue has been reported by several people and steam are doing nothing to resolve it - not even acknowledging that the problem exists. avoid this game.\n\n\nNew revised opinion.\n\nOnce Uplay managed to sort out the mess with the CD key and access to their servers, I managed to put some time into the game.  Overall, I'm enjoying the experience, it's a fun game and anyone who enjoys turn based RPGs will love it.  There are some really great encounters to be had, I really enjoyed the boss fights - seemingly impossible encounters become doable once you put some thought into how you will approach the fight - I like that in a game. I really hope they will release more content as this game has a lot of promise.  It needs polishing - some of the quests don't quite work in their timing, because of the way many areas are locked out until you reach certain goals you receive some quests that can't be resolved until much later in the game and annoyingly you also solve some quests earlier than you receive them (so you end up getting the quest and completing the quest in at the same time) - minor points reallyu, but I hope the devs look into it to create a more polished overall game.\n\nOne more thing - the "Deluxe" version still seems like a bit of a scam, the "unique" content hasn't been developed yet, so you don't really get much for your extra money.","January 24, 2014","true","252.5"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

Before this, the game would crash with an error report every single time.  This took several hours of trial-and-error, during which I was not very happy.\n\nHaving not played any of the other series before this one, I can say that the combat style is turned based, similar to say... Final Fantasy 7 turned-based.  Navigation through the world is tile-based, which I didn't like or dislike; since the graphic scenery was consistently believable enough.  There are some load time issues while traversing the world and I was getting bad frame rates in some areas.  The graphics are mostly above-average but occasionally there are some very poorly textured objects.\nI did not find any game-ending bugs but there were some plot-line bugs and companion NPC's  working incorrectly like the Negotiator NPC not giving the proper discount for goods.\n\nPlot-wise & quest-wise, the game held my attention enough for me to complete it from start to end.  I took my time finishing the game and even restarted several times to test out new class combinations.  It honestly took me about a week to finish but- as I said- I was learning the game and restarting several times.  There is a hard starting condition where your party has practically nothing and needs everything to survive- new equipment, new spells, new general knowledge to learn about the surrounding area, and a tide of quests to complete.  This is the funnest part of the game for me, due to the difficulty.  About mid-game it becomes apparent that your characters have every inventory slot filled (some with uber-powerful relics), necessary spells purchased & learned, with skill trees grand-mastered--- and while I would have liked the enemies, especially the bosses, to scale they did not.  A lot of the boss fights towards end game were simply the same exact spell casting order that I used to kill the lesser enemies on the plains.  This is when the difficulty practically tapers off.  Towards the end-game I distinctly remember several boss battles where I stayed at range and casted the same 2 ranged spells by my mages; meanwhile the boss couldn't even out-damage the base-line regen spell cast at the start of battle.  The boss inevitably dies to simple attrition and I get an uber relic.  Battles like this are stress-free and the most relaxing battles ever fought, but the fun-factor suffers greatly.\n\nAfter finishing the game I think the final score lies somewhere between around 80/100.  Due to bugs I might drop that score down a bit since there are a lot of bugs that need to be addressed.  Then again, the asking price is what makes the game worthwhile at a little over $20 so regardless a score of 80 feels justified.  It is a thumbs-up.","January 24, 2014","true","1.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CrzyAzn13/recommended/238750/","CrzyAzn13","Arynis","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CrzyAzn13/","19 products in account","I have always been a M&M loyal friend.  Even though I considered IX one of the worst of the main series, once I saw X:Legacy, I jumped on it like a kid on cake.  When I found out they went back to the original mechanics of grid-based movement, I was intrigued.  I grew up with I-V, and although I really enjoyed VI-VIII, there's something special about keeping true to the game that started it all.\n\nNow that I've covered my background story, here's my main review points for X:Legacy.\n\nFirst, it's raw... as in "Early Access Beta  Test" raw.  I discovered early on that if a conversation with an NPC is a bit long in narration, it's cut off early.  I really wanted to hear more of what the Guard Captain of Sorpigal-by-the-Sea after his Quest was completed.\n\nSecond, when I toured the city and found the "Training Grounds"... I expected that to be the place I would level my characters.  This has been the case for 9 games, but when I found out I can level... for FREE... on the SPOT!  I was shocked...   I really don't know if that's a good or bad thing.\n\nThird, I don't know if I am missing something, but there are certain things that seem lacking right off the bat.  The ability to ID or Repair via Skill or Spell was something I found necessary.  Yes, I do remember having to rely on a shopkeeper early on.  However, in the past, there was ONE shop. It did everything.  X:Legacy seems to bring together the worst of VI and the worst of I-V by having THREE different shops, each with their own repair and only one with the ability to ID my loot.  You mean to tell me that a Armorsmith can't ID "Armor"?  I also remember there were Robbers/Theives who ID'd traps/treasures/etc. and Sorcerers who could manage the same via spells.  Having to walk 500 blocks just for an ID isn't friendly.  Yes, this was probably my harshest of the criticisms... but as I stated before, this game is 'raw'.\n\nNext, Character Manual Creation... I liked its implementation in VI, but this new skill tree led to some ... odd circumstances.  I wound up with a 'Healer' without the ability to fight... even with his/her fists.  There used to be a standard set of things that came with a character.  Light armor/Small Weapons... A sling! of all things.  But to be completely unarmed and unable to fight except through spells? Unheard of, at least as far back as I can remember.  To top it off, for early weapons, I was not pleased to see that a simple staff REQUIRED EXPERT skill.  Since when?  No weapon in all of Cron or Terra or wherever required a minimum skill...  Class/Alignment restricted sure, but not skill.  Skills improved the basic ability of a weapon, that's how it should be.  This is my other harsh criticism thus far.\n\nFinally, everything else.  Graphically, it's ok... M&M has never been known to have particularly 'state of the art' scenery.  But what it lacked visually, it made up for in huge worlds labyrinthine worlds.  Now here's X:Legacy!  Nine sequels since the original. I'm going to use Sorpigal-by-the-Sea as my example.  It's not even a tenth of what Middlegate was (MM2) It's barely the size of Sorpigal (MM6). And it's grid based with borders that load a whole other area.  I'd almost expect the place to be Crap-My-Pants BEAUTIFUL!  Especially with the very minimal interactions with the enviroment, minimal movement options, and extraneous people/obstacles that are only there for visual goodies and serve NO purpose but to be in my way.  I haven't made it far into the so-called "Open World" but so far, it's a bit lackluster for what I'm able to see in such limited space.  Take a look at even older games as EQII or WoW or even new games like FFXIV.  Those worlds were free-roam with powerful imagery.  I'm in a grid-based static world and the imagery is just above mediocre.\n\nThe Combat system is ok... a bit clunky feeling but for a turn-based set up, it's ok.  Again, graphically, it lacks quite a bit, in my opinion.  Ambushes are fun, that's for sure.  Do like them ambushes. LOL.  The auto-loot mechanic is ok.  Too subtle for my opinion though.  I miss the searching and the booby traps (MM1-2) or just the searching (MM 1-9).\n\nSadly, I haven't fully explored the game so far... and finally earned enough gold to buy some new spells... that find traps and hidden areas.  I'm hoping those are useful.  However, since I haven't found a way to respawn monsters yet... there's a bit of a limitation in gold and thus... food/rest/mana potion options.\n\nOverall, I'd rate the game RAW out of 10!   I'll come back when the Full Game is launched and patched a few times and give an honest score. :)","December 12, 2013","true","108.0"," 13 of 26 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","13","26","0","0"

The old-fashioned controls work fine once you get used to them and add a bit of strategic gameplay that would otherwise be missing. It doesn't hold your hand so you'll probably restart a few times after messing up or because you want to try to optimize your party, but that was fine for me.\n\nIt can be frustrating at points and for a game that relies on a lot of quicksaves and loads - you will die a lot - loading was very slow.\n\nA minor niggle: there's basically zero NPC AI or immersion. It almost impressively bad, e.g., when you solve the mystery in the first location for example the NPC texts involving the mystery don't change at all.

That said, some people do experience some game-breaking bugs, so your mileage may well vary!\n\nTha said, it's a spot-on solid homage to the older style of party-based first-person turn-based grid-based adventury games! There's secrets, spells, NPCs and quests, puzzles aplenty, riddles to answer, quests to do, etc. etc. At this point the game seems to be pretty playable and most bugs are work-aroundable at worst, though again it may just be that I got lucky, it's hard to say!\n\nEach race has its own set of classes with their own unique promotion/promotion skill, skillsets, and so forth. The game starts out pretty smoothly and progresses nicely in terms of difficulty and character strength - I did feel my melee characters ended up a bit too strong by the end, but my magey fellow caught up right at the end-game, finally. It's really a pretty solid RPG of the style, and the only thing around since Grimrock (which isn't quite the same, anyways, though solid in its own right.)","March 11, 2014","true","3.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

To use the mod kit you have to download UnityPro, after 30 days unityPro costs 1500$ once or 75$ per month to use. 32 bit users are getting screwed because they have no sound effects and are reduced to middle grafic settings. So false advertising at work in the shop.\n\nIt uses Ubisoft launcher as second layer of drm, isnt it fun? Problems with your internet connection? Bad luck you will not be able to play it.\n\nThe technical aspect of the game is horrible. On 32 bit system the game is incomplete, you get only middle textures, no party sounds, no monster sounds and other features are missing. The overall performance is bad. On 64 bit you get hight textures, animations and all but it does not look too good at all. That would be tolerable, roleplaying games are mostly about gameplay and not super grafic quality. But the performance is supbar compared to the grafic quality delivered. It runs really choppy and many systems. Even on the latest 780 gforce power rigs it does not run smooth so that is that. Performancewise it is a catastrophe.\n\nGameplay: 12 classes Defender, Bladedancer, Ranger, Mecenary , Freemage, Shaman, Druid, Runepriest, Barbarian, Scout, Crusader. Unfortunately ranged classes like the ranger and scout are useless farther into the game. You have very little opportunity to fight monsters at range, in melee they do next to no damage, because the main ranged stat perception does not improve the damageoutput of melee much.\n\nThe Ranger gets a point blank shot, this does not really help to improve his damage output. Magic classes are strong until the monsters get rediculous high resistance against their magic school. Most monster are resistent against a magic school or general resistent against all magic, so tough luck if your chosen magic school like fire or wind does nothing against that special pack of monsters or the boss. Magic user tend to burn your mana potion resources like mana addicts.\n\nDefender, Bladedance and Crusader perform very good, the blade dancer with daggers buffed up by crusader spells is the best damage dealer in the game by a wide margin. He is so op that it brakes the whole class system. You will struggle without a bladedancer or barbarian as damage dealer in your party.\n\nThe whole class system is borked and unbalanced\n\nThe combat relies very much on luck and potion chucking, It does not feel very might and magic like in the later stages of the game. With a suboptimal(no bladedancer or two)  party you get one tough as nails fight after the other, in m&m series the game would throw many easy monsters at you to test your resource managementskills and use of aid spells, but not one hard battle after the other. The pacing is frustrating and not fun even on the easier adventurer mode. The encounterdesign is not good, it is one overly hard battle after the other, even for trash monsters. There is no respawn, the monster count is too low to succed by grinding. M&m x is the only rpg i know where i can't win through overleveling, so for me it is no rpg at all. Leveling your character through grinding, getting better equipment, farming gold, leveling skills is what makes a good rpg for me.\n\nthe skill system is more might and magic like. It is very rudimental and easy. You have 4 skillpoints per level to invest in your skills, after 7 15 20 skillpoints you can upgrade to a new skilltier, expert, master, grandmaster, you will get boni for each upgrade. Some skills are more powerfull then others. So magic skills get 5% 10% 15% spell penetration and more resistance against that magic school while the infamous dagger skill gets expert 1 extra attack and plus hitrate, and on grand master 2 extra attacks and plus hitrate. Combined with dual whield skill you can get a staggering amount of 6 attacks per round, your bladedancer becomes a weapon of mass destruction. Compared to this all other skills and magic school are just a joke in terms of damageoutput. You will need some skills/spells to progress like protection against status ailments, healing spells but for raw damage dagger and dual whield is greater then none.\n\nPer levelup you get 4 attribute points you can allocate where you wish. For a seasoned rpg player it should be easy to get a deasant build. Melee 2 strength 1 perc, 1 vit, magic 1 magic, 1 vit 2 spirit in the beginning and 2 magic 1 vit 1 spirit later when you have enough manapoints (never).\n\nI think the game release was rushed, the gameplay is boring and frustrating, the encounters are onesided against the player to the extreme, you cannot grind in a rpg!, the performance is bad even for the grafics and on excellent gaming rigs, the skills, classes, monster encounters are not balanced at all. I do not recommend this game.\n\nHave a nice day","January 28, 2014","false","13.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Too many bugs. Combat movement a pain in the butt. Annoyingly long walks from location to location. Sometimes having to quit the middle of a dungeon and slow walk all the way back to town to restock.

The game is very old school but is very incomplete, if it was released in the state it is now, 2 patches, you would not be happy. As I have stated it is ubfinished. For example, the second patch added ability to conpare items and mark map.\nIf you have the money and want to be involved in the development process then try it,however, i can not stress how much the developers need to add. The animations are rudimentary. The sun cycles are not yet right. It is old School. If the Devs add voice and animations to brind it into this decade it will be a hit. I wanted a game like the ones from the 90s but with bells and stuff from 2010. It is far from that\nUPDATE AFTER MOST RECENT PATCH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

You may not like this style of game. Lastly, for 25 dollars it is a steal for the older crowd that played these games as kids. If you want to see what old school really is like with todays grafixs /bells and sound go for it.If you despise turn based role playing dnd type games with clues, lore, and story then this game is not for you.","January 5, 2014","true","296.4"," 16 of 33 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","16","33","0","0"

I'm not entirely sure of the development of this game but I suspect Ubisoft just threw these guys permission to use the license and very little in the way of funding.  The game feels extremely low budget.  Worse than some indie games.  Even looking past superficials like the unpolished graphics and lack of voice acting (things one would assume to be better with a AAA publisher) the mechanics are overly shallow such that most people will probably burn out on the excessive content due to tedium.\n\nMelee is very basic with only one talent tree and limited attacks.  Range is pointless given the number of ambushes you face (and there's a penalty for shooting things at point blank/melee range).  The magic schools don't feel sufficiently different and mostly consist of nukes plus a couple of superfluous buff spells.  Yes, there are towns and quests and merchants and the occassional puzzle but all of it is very rudimentary.  Itemization is terrible consisting of a few hand placed relics with the rest being randomized Diablo-style crap.\n\nMMX Legacy should be more polished and deeper than Grimrock (and not merely a turn-based alternative).  It isn't.  Moreoever it is arguably worse in some aspects like level design, character progression, itemization, etc.  You're better off playing the old Bard's Tale series as the graphics are only slightly worse but the gameplay is much deeper.   But that was funded by Interplay, right?  Well... this was ostensibly funded by Ubisoft.  Apparently not.  A shame.  Had they given this the funding they put in other iteration of the M&M series this would have been a fantastic game.  In its current condition it is mediocre at best.","February 16, 2015","false","22.7"," 10 of 21 people (48%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","48","10","21","2","2"

The turn-based movement and fights system is interesting and works very well with the game, although you might need to get used to it nowadays. The story is good and carries you over a continent, several magical places and through at least two dreams/memories.\n\nPROS:\n- it's Might and Magic with it's old charm and playability\n- classes are great, each one of them has a different skillset and you can spend hours optimising and synchronising parties to reach the best combo.\n- lots of items, magic and world to discover\n- it's fun\n\nCONS:\n- the turn-based/step moving may not be for everyone. Also, maps tend to be quite complex and the graphics around sometimes does not really reflect where you can and can not go, which will make you look more at the minimap, than the actual screen when moving. (Yon-chall forest, looking at you!)\n- maps can not be scrolled. World map shows artwork without paths and local map shows only vicinity around you. What makes running to the other side of the map a bit more difficult, when trying to find things or people.\n- the very last level in the last dungeon, where you'll meet the Big Bad of the story and he will attack you and disappear only to come back in a while and attack you again is more annoying than difficult.\n\n\nTL;DR - "back to oldschool" RPG game with very well made classes, skills and character development system. The story isn't bad either and the graphics is much better than oldschool games.","January 11, 2014","true","48.8"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","8","17","0","0"

If you are a RPG lover, stop by and look for a decent rpg, then you need to look for other better games.\n\nI have played through the early access, and it was disappointing. I didn't make a comment because it was still beta phase. The full version has made tremendous improvments. For instance, the weapons won't break every second; you wouldn't fail to see your fingers at night due to poor lighting design. I see more barrels with more intereting content and better designed balance such as monster strength and potion pricing.\n\nHowever, the core problems of the early access are not addressed.\n\nFirst is no innovation at all. The game play and design is shockingly simplistic. You walk, see monsters, press 1144, then the monsters die. Class leveling is a straight one-way ticket. Monster fighting is the battle on who has more potions. This kind of game design maybe interesting 20 years ago. But to produce such a game at 21st century and charge people 25 dollars for it is simply not acceptable. There are some interesting puzzles, but not enough to make the game attractive.\n\nThen here comes the cheapskate strategy of reduce, recycle and reuse. Ubisoft used this strategy on heroes VI, I still bear with it. However, what is this?  The monster appearance, NPCs, music and every other thing you see basically comes from dark messiah and heroesVI. Being of the same world Ashan, I guess some repetition is fine. But this games has gone too far. The worst part is these two games are of totally different age and types. Forcing elements of these two games into one feels like a big modded rpg from some random players community like WOG. Not to mention the texture and graphic is horrible. Some people say it doesn't work with 32bit OS, but my win8 64bit seems to have the same problem as well. In one word: they shouldn't charge 25USD just for a recycled product.\n\nIn conclusion, I am not against turn-based strategy games or rpg. But this game is nowhere on par with any decent modern day rpg. It is good for nostalgia. But if you are a real old school MMM fan you won't be bothered to read this review anyway. So I won't recommend to any general rpg players.","January 24, 2014","false","482.5"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"

But combat rather feels like Wizardry 8 since it is fully turn based so no moving/strafing around and wild clicking like in LoG.\nWhat is really different and could be seen as flaw is that it doesn't use any group formation. I really had to get used to this as I clearly expected to be able to place my weak characters in the back so that they won't get hit but in fact the whole group (and also a certain amount of enemies can) share 1 tile. But the game uses other features to circumvent this "flaw". Every character can easily (1 skill point) learn a skill that if he uses it for attacking lets the enemy counterattack this character the next round. So you have to use this special attack for your fighter/high defense/hitpoints characters to draw the attacks of enemies away from your mages/rangers. The problem with this is that you often face more than 1 (or 2) enemies at a time, some enemies are simply immune to that kind of taunt and strong enemies also often use group attacks that harm every member so even when using that skill the weak characters die/fall unconscious more often than your "front" warriors which really can be annoying. Falling unconscious only means losing the experience points from any enemies that are killed during that state while dead characters can only be revived with high level skills or in town. The fighting in general can be very tough. You often stumble over enemies that easily wipe your party. But this also is one of the best parts of that game - at least for me. It is highly motivating to encounter enemies you can't defeat yet but knowing that you will defeat them when you come back later. I love RPGs that handle it this way. Another thing I like is that enemies don't respawn. When you clear an area it stays cleared.\nAlthough I think that the fights are tougher than e.g. in LoG, the game is quite forgiving since you can easily quicksave/reload (not during fight though). Also it is much more convenient to play thanks to the excellent automap. The story of the game is mediocre I think and also there are no great characters that kept me engaged. But what keeps me motivated is the constant feel of reward because you level up quite often and always get attribute and skill points to distribute. Once you reach a new skill level (novice, expert, master, grand master) you need to find the correct trainer so that you can finally unlock the benefit of that skill rank. So the game always keeps you going (something e.g. Wasteland 2 lacks of). What greatly adds to the motivation is an item system comparable with diablo. So there are tons of items to find that always are a little better than the one you already own. There are green items with 1 magic attribute, blue with 2 and yellow (relics) that get up to 4 attributes but need to gain experience first. Those also don't need to be repaired - correct, items get worn over time and need to be repaired to restore their full potential. But this happens quite slowly and most of the time you found better gear already before you have to repair the old one.\n\nYou can argue about if fights are rewarding enough though. You gain much more experience by completing quests and also the loot of the standard fights consists of standard (random?) items like potions or mostly useless gear. So only boss fights drop something special but most stuff can be found in chests (which are often hidden though).\nSecrets are also discussworthy. You don't have to search every wall for that special mark you have to click like in LoG but instead you either need to cast a spell that wears off after 50+ turns (depends on magic skill) and marks secrets or you need the correct companion to find secrets. Companions are also a neat idea. You can have up to 2 join and they give some special bonus to the party like better prices at the merchant or a healing now and then. Most of them need to be paid though and some quests let you have join one. There is one annoying problem with the companions. There are some that join for quests and you can't remove them from your party until the quest is solved. Also there is a horse as companion that doubles your inventory which is very important - at least for hoarders like me. To be honest you don't need it and will have enough gold to buy anything by the mid of the game anyway... But I ended up having the horse and a quest guy that needed to go to a special place I could not yet reach and the result was that I was blocked in the main quest until I got rid of lots of stuff and my horse to be able to continue.\nSo back to the secrets: Once you found a secret you still have to decide which character of your group wants to try to "use" it. Different secrets make different checks for might, magic or perception (I think). You can either learn the different signs or just reload if it didn't work (the char will fall unconscious if he fails). The same can be sad about the barrels that can be found everywhere. They contain a liquid with different colors and every colour stands for a stat that increases permanently when drinking the liquid. So it is the basic functionality of permanent +1 to some stat that you know from other modern RPGs where you have to collect flowers or similar stuff and this also adds some motivation.\n\nI didn't mention the biggest flaw in my eyes yet: You will stumble across certain quest items/characters/locations that won't do anything because they are only available for certain characters and you can't have all of them in your party. That is some really bad design here because you end up confused and don't know if you are missing something or if it is just not possible to do something. I ended up checking forums whenever I was uncertain if I am blind...\nAlso I should mention that large parts of the map are blocked as long as you didn't get certain "skills" that let you pass through. I think that mechanic is ok, it only causes much backtracking to locations you couldn't visit earlier. It is only really annoying when such a block is deep within a dungeon. You can mark such spots on the worldmap so at least they are easy to find later (the map can become clustered with notes though).\n\nSo in the end I had a mixed experience. Most hours were great fun and I couldn't stop. Some were quite annoying and in the end I didn't finish the game because it was too easy and I already got most of the rewards/unlocks/max skills I was playing for.","December 31, 2014","true","57.3"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/juliettestray/recommended/238750/","juliettestray","Juliette Stray","http://steamcommunity.com/id/juliettestray/","461 products in account","I'm going to slog through this game anyway out of dedication to the series, but honestly... it's pretty bad. If you've ever played any of the original Might & Magic games and were excited to play the much-hyped revamp... well, that's too bad, because there isn't really anything they have in common with them aside from some loose superficiality.\n\n\nCharacter creation:\nThere really isn't any. This may seem surprising at the outset -- after all, hasn't this kind of always been a hallmark of the entire series? Tweak your character and your party (because, hey, who wants the default party, right?) and test your theories to see if it's survivable. Sometimes you may not even find out until halfway through the game. Balance your party with early, mid, and late-game classes, and grind your way up to success, right?\n\nWell.. no. There are four races, and each race has three classes (a 'might' class, a 'magic' class, and a hybrid class). Each one gets one or two special abilities once they're promoted (like MM6), and also like MM6, you have to receive 'training' to go from novice to expert to master to grandmaster in your skills. Like MM6, these trainers are also spread all throughout the world, and you have to learn where they are (or read a spoiler). Your class choice feels almost entirely flavourless, and pretty much only determines what skills you can raise to what caps (and at times, what skills you can even learn at all). Also, you only get four party members.\n\n\nControl and feel:\nThe game is on a grid, like Xeen-style era of Might & Magic, and things only move when you do. Monsters don't patrol, however, and unless they 'see' you, they won't go anywhere. When they do see you, the 'danger' light turns hostile, and they will proceed to chase you... forever. You cannot outrun monsters or get them to some kind of 'tether' range, so if you step into the wrong area, your only option is to reload the game. There is no fleeing.\n\nNPCs are also like the Xeen era of M&M, in the sense that they appear to only be found in towns (or in map objects on the main map), and do not move. They CAN be found standing around in the game world in towns, but do not actually move. The ones that you can't talk to (which is most of them) do, however, tend to say one of possibly four or five quipped lines, which will replay, endlessly, every time you are standing near them. This is also true of 'environment' sound effects like mumbling, people shuffling things, hammers on anvils, etc. It is generally one sound that loops forever until you step away.\n\n\nUI:\nThe UI is pretty minimal, which is OK. There is an 'action bar', akin to the one on most MMOs, with 10 slots that you can set for each of your 4 party members. Frequently, however (particularly on a mage), you will have to go to your skill book and manually cast from there, as it's simply not feasable to have everything you need on the bar. Not a big deal; it's split up intelligently.\n\nThere is a minimap, which autorecords your progress on a gridded map. Unfortunately, however, you can not scroll this map even when you make it larger, so if you're looking for somewhere that's off the side of the enlarged map, too bad.\n\n\nGameplay:\nThere aren't terribly many spells per spell 'level' per school, but there are a lot of schools, which means there's still a hefty amount of spells. Unlike previous games in the series, there are not 'master' or 'grandmaster' schools of each element, there are simply libraries in each town that have all the spells and you pick from there.\n\nWeapons and armour can break (this appears to be random chance -- I had a new item I just picked up break in a second combat, and a weapon I used the entire game until then -- 17 hours in -- never break), which degrades their stats until you go to town to repair it. There is no 'mobile repair' that I've encountered yet, though perhaps there is a spell for it that I'm unaware of.\n\nLike previous Might and Magic games, you can have two 'hirelings' (sometimes one or both may be a mandatory 'quest' hireling), but these hirelings do not participate in combat as they did in the later versions -- they are back to simply providing an auxiliary benefit for a small percentage cut of your gold and a hiring fee.\n\nThere is no grinding, not because grinding is not necessary, but because monsters do not respawn. Ever. If you have killed a monster, it is permanently gone. This means that there is a *fixed* finite level of gold and loot in the game, and even things like the "well, it'll respawn in a few months" option in previous iterations of the series is gone.\n\nThere is no party formation -- each spot in the party lineup is equal, and it doesn't matter if you get flanked or attacked from behind. Everything does the same damage with the same random odds of it hitting someone as anything else.\n\nLike some later M&M games, you get food (called 'supplies' in this one) to camp, and can only camp so many times before having to resupply. Camping cannot be interrupted.\n\nAreas are 'gated' by progress -- did you put points into 'shield' to get it to expert level (the first tier past the starting one) so you can have that extra edge on the boss you're fighting in the beginning? Well, too bad, because that's in the second town, and you can't get there no matter what because some NPC is standing around saying the bridge is off limits, or the gates are shut, or what-have-you. Everything is limited in this fashion -- you may be given a region to explore in that's open (and consequently, may have monsters too hard for you -- which, again, you can't run from, you simply have to reload), but anything outside of that region is always gated. Don't know what trainers are available in the area and don't want to read spoilers? Sucks to be you, because if you opted to put things into your skills and got to a skill tier that's in the next 'zone', you don't get to use it.\n\nYou have one single inventory, and it's on a grid that does not get larger. Later you will find yourself needing to stop your dungeon delve to go back to town to sell everything, which is mildly obnoxious. I don't yet know if the Lloyd's Beacon spells have made it into this game, however, because...\n\n\nFaithfulness to source material:\nNone. This isn't Might & Magic, this is Heroes of Might and Magic: the RPG, which is a *distinctly different game*. The original Might & Magic games were a kind of silly but fun hybrid of extreme sci-fi with high fantasy. There were spaceships and computers and people and races from other planets, and later your samurai would be dodging ray guns from robots. There is and will be none of that here (one early NPC, in fact, says he was exiled because he thought that stars might be other planets), because this is all set in Ashan, the world from the Heroes of Might and Magic games. This is actually *incredibly irritating*, much moreso than I thought it would be or than it sounds on the surface, but I think it has something to do with the fact that this was touted as a long-awaited return of a game for the fans, and then (presumably Ubisoft) proceeded to crap all over everything that would've actually done that.\n\n\nConclusion:\nThe game basically feels like Grimrock, except there aren't any secrets you can spy (you just cast the detect secrets spell, and if you don't have it up, the secrets don't show up, period) and the plot is less interesting. Yes, the plot is *less interesting* than "yo we put you doods in a hole gl hf." I've dutifully been reading everything that I've come across, including all the lore books, and I really just don't care at all about it. It's extremely low-tier regional politics (that will, I'm sure, eventually involve demons or angels or both), and I'm 20 hours in (the amount of time sunk being telling, given that everything is gated and linear).\n\nI'm really not happy with it. The entire game plays like a demo game that's a lead-in for user content. Sad.","April 17, 2014","false","20.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

As if to add insult to injury, UbiSoft gives us the extremely good MM6 as a part of the deal as if to tell you - here, this is what Might and Magic 6 represented - tons of spells, water walking, flight, exploration, the ability to look under every nook and cranny and actually be rewarded for it. Might and Magic 6-8 were the golden years of the franchise, and every game brought the lineage to new hights. Then came MM9 which pretty much destroyed all the exploration, but added new 3D engine and interesting locales with roughly as much freedom as its forefathers.\n\nAnd now, as a slap in the face comes MMX Legacy with its MM6 bonus. Let's compare the two:\n1. Movement.\n1.1. MM6 has free movement, turning, water walking, flight, strategic positioning even while entering combat AND during combat.\n1.2. MMX is rigid as hell. You are forced into a square grid which not only makes the whole movement experince choppy and unpleasant, but also forces you to turn around just as choppily just to see if you haven't missed anything. Why were can't I enter water squares without having a certain god's blessing? Did people simply forget what a Water Walk spell is?\n2. Combat.\n2.1. MM6 has the best of both systems - turn based combat and real time combat. Turn based combat works like MMX, while in real time you could fly, play to the enemies' disadvantages (like use Water Walk and escpe on water while range attacking the enemies). It was liberating as hell and actually encouraged strategic thinking.\n2.2. MMX combat is rigid and there is little need for strategy. Battles are best won if you can put yourself in a corner or a corridor so that only a few enemies at a time have the opportunity to attack you, while you pick them off easily as the others simply wait dumbly for their turns to enter your killzone. And people said that flying and water walking in MM6-8 was exploiting the system...\n3. Exploration.\n3.1. MM6 encouraged exploration on any level and at any time and actually rewarded you for it. And to prove that, the devs actually put a flight scroll in your starting city, so that you can go and explore. Opening every inch of a map in MM6 is exciting and rewards you with secret islands off the coast that have money or chests lying around, craters in mountains with obelisks, chests, and other rewards. I even found extremely rare items like artifacts and relics in such chests! Even if you encounter difficullt enemies (like even dragons or titans), you have a chance to fly or teleport away to escape and come back later.\n3.2. MMX offers little in terms of exploration, mainly because everything is a corridor - and even if you get adventurous and press on, you get punished by it, because you encounter very difficult enemies and have little or no chance against them, which results in death. Artifacts and Relics are found in specific location, and up until now with 2 running play-throughs with 2 different groups, I found the same artifacts in the very same spots in the very sam dungeons. YAY!\n4. Equipment.\n4.1. MM6 has tons of gear diversity. You would just bite your nails before opening a chest or looting a body, looking at that hotbar right above your characters. Ding... You find 24 gold and an item (Axe)! - hell yeah, my guy needs a new one, is it better? Ding... You found 1096 gold and an item (Relic)! OH YEAH!!! What does it do? Can I even identify it? Can any of guys use it? OH it's a ring, all of my guys can use rings, but I don't know what it does! Screw that, I am porting to town to find out! This nailbiting, mouthwatering experience is very much gone in MMX.\n4.2. MMX has a very rigid gear system. 90% of the time I have been finding better stuff in shops than in chests or the bodies of slain enemies. If you want to make a specific character build, you have to rely on the shops in the various cities. And yeah, just go to that same dungeon to get your artifact at the end. YAY...\n5. Characters and classes.\nMMX does have more diversity in Race/Class creation than MM6 (12 vs 9), but one can't escape the feeling that many of those race/class combos play and feel the same. They also reuse the MM6 system of making specialized fighters & casters, and then add hybrids of both classes. So in essense, you have 4 warrior classes, 4 Hybrid classes and 4 Caster classes. One nukes more, another heals more. One gets an extra attack, the other is better protected. Hybrids can really accomplish a lot and supplement your party well. A touch and go system, really...\nIn MM6 you had limitations - you Cleric was a poor fighter, but could heal and learn Light/Dark Magic and become an even better healer, buffer, or nuker. Your Knight could wear the best armor and hit like a ten ton truck, and get more attacks per turn. Your Paladin (the Knight/Cleric combo) could hit and heal, but had no access to the best healing & buffing spells from the light tree.\nHere, you get a Crusader with Lay on Hands for max heals at any given time at the cost of all your mana who can learn Grandmaster Light Magic (cool heals/buffs), Grandmaster Sword (good fighter), Grandmaster Heavy (well protected), Grandmaster Arcane (Lots of magic resistance). Why not have a few of those in your party, then? IMO, Crusaders very much break the game.\n\n6. To conclude: please don't get me started on the UDONTPLAY 3rd party DRM...\n\nEDIT: As I put it in the comment: That being said, I am a completionist and I will still finish the game. I, however, cannot shake the feeling that it is inferior to all others though. It is like returning to the dark times before your golden age just for the sake of nostalgia.\n\nIn short, I would recommend that you buy an MM6-8 bundle and immerse yourself in the 3D-ish world of those games. Explore, fly, walk on water, steal stuff and have fun. Don't be swayed by this Grimrock-style Might and Magic game just because of the Might and Magic in it like I was...","February 21, 2015","false","42.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","3"

It was horrible.  I was very hopeful that M&M10 could restore the legacy and for the most part, it was a good step forward.  The tile-by-tile movement took awhile to get used to since everyone seems to use a "free-look" movement these days.  The very simplistic mapping system could use some help.  The graphics should have been much better given the amount of time that's passed since it's predecessor.  Combat could have been much less frustrating if the mobs had levels or some indication of how tough they were.  As it is, you don't know until the fight begins and your party is dead in two swings.  A lot of the quests were very vague, to the point where i had to Google about a dozen to figure out what I should be doing.  Lastly, I think the gameplay could be balanced a little better.  While I didn't play every possible party configuration, I think upwards of 60% of possible class combinations are doomed to fail.  The game should encourage you to mix it up rather than conform to the healer-warrior-ranged-magic combination and after three game restarts, that's how it felt to me.","January 13, 2015","false","80.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

To conclude: please don't get me started on the UDONTPLAY 3rd party DRM...\n\nEDIT: As I put it in the comment: That being said, I am a completionist and I will still finish the game. I, however, cannot shake the feeling that it is inferior to all others though. It is like returning to the dark times before your golden age just for the sake of nostalgia.\n\nIn short, I would recommend that you buy an MM6-8 bundle and immerse yourself in the 3D-ish world of those games. Explore, fly, walk on water, steal stuff and have fun. Don't be swayed by this Grimrock-style Might and Magic game just because of the Might and Magic in it like I was...","February 21, 2015","false","42.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","3"

I killed as many spiders as I could stomach, and I was ready to stab my myself in the eye with my Magic Mouse.\n\nI was hoping it would be in the vein of Dragons Age, but I was sadly mistaken.

I bought it on a whim when I saw that it was on sale, and, for a title that promised to be one of the few new turn-based RPG's released in a very long time (an underrated - and popularly unpopular in the sense that everybody wants to play them but no developer wants to make them - genre if there ever was one), and it turns out that Uplay is preventing me from playing this game. I try to create an account with them, but this is apparently impossible due to there being no Ubisoft server available.\n\nSo, it may have been only $24 dollars for this (brand-new) game (in addition to others), but it matters diddly and squat when I can't even play the game. I later found out that Ubisoft have pulled the plug on this game...how sad. Hadn't even been released for a year, and I likewise read on the forums that this game is full of bugs and other defects. But, since I am barred from even registering the title that I paid my own hard-earned money to acquire, I have been unable to experience it firsthand.\n\nThis is unprofessional to say the least.\n\nSince there is little hope of the issues involving this game being addressed, I can only hope that somebody who was considering buying the game reads this review and decides against it. If I have achieved that, I will consider this a success.\n\nNOTE: if, at some point in the future, I am able to access this title, this review may change. However, I am close to giving up on this.\n\nPOST EDIT: I managed to figure out how to create my Uplay account and played the game for a grand total of "this game is boring, don't even bother."

Uplay DRM sucks. Ubisoft. Go ♥♥♥♥ yourselves.\n\nHistory:\nMy first Might and Magic game was Might and Magic 3, on DOS.\nI bought this due to Nostalgia.\n\nUPLAY's DRM:\nWhat's the difference between a virus and Uplay? A virus works.\nSeriously. It's more like UPRAY the damn thing works.\nNow I know why their logo looks like a sphincter, because I got ♥♥♥♥ed in the ♥♥♥.\nThey changed my ubi.com account to a uplay because '♥♥♥♥ you' that's why. But, then there was a password breach.\nNow. I can't log into my other account. 'Forget Password' is a button that does nothing.   ...NOTHING!\nWhen creating another account in-game it says Ubisoft's servers are down.\nUbisoft servers seem to go down more often than a two dollar hooker.\nYet, I was able to create an account on their webpage.\nWhy does it work on the website but not in-game? Because '♥♥♥♥ you', that's why.\nSeriously ♥♥♥♥ YOU Ubisoft. I only bought this POS for nostalgia (and regretted it 20 minutes later). If you're an Ubisoft executive, you should go castrate yourself. You're too stupid to breed.\n\nDISCLAIMER:\nThe 40 minutes of trying to bypass the UPLAY DRM just to play the damn game somewhat tarnished my feelings towards the rest of the game.\n\nTHE STORY:\nOh for ♥♥♥♥ sake. This is a perfect example of how NOT to do an intro.\nYou get this amazing rambling piece of ♥♥♥♥, while this wonderfully rendered woman reads a book.  Exciting? No. It's like Grandpa Simpson...tons of references, and naming of locations I have no clue about.\nImagine the fantasy version of this:\n\n"We can't bust heads like we used to, but we have our ways. One trick is to tell 'em stories that don't go anywhere - like the time I caught the ferry over to Shelbyville. I needed a new heel for my shoe, so, I decided to go to Morganville, which is what they called Shelbyville in those days. So I tied an onion to my belt, which was the style at the time. Now, to take the ferry cost a nickel, and in those days, nickels had pictures of bumblebees on 'em. Give me five bees for a quarter, you'd say.\n\nNow where were we? Oh yeah: the important thing was I had an onion on my belt, which was the style at the time. They didn't have white onions because of the war. The only thing you could get was those big yellow ones..."\n\nThat's our intro. The 2D art in the book was nice. It would have been better if these 'Raiders' matched my character.\n\nOnce in the game, It looked like Unreal Tournament or Quake 3. I had the graphics maxed out. I am rolling with a Titan here. It has to be a bug. But this was my play experience.\n\nI found it funny there's a retro option to make the graphics suck more.\n\nVOICES: Oh great voices! Oh wait. They give you a line, and you have to read the rest. The character's mouths don't move.\n\nIt's like I got a game from the late 1990s.  Well, steam offers old games... what is the release date? RELEASE DATE 2014?!?!\nOh ♥♥♥♥ you.  Legend of Grimrock was made by an indie studio with almost no budget and looks so much better. This game wishes it was Legend of Grimrock II.\n\nAt this point, I gave up. This is an indie title made by a big publisher. Poor Developers, they probably would have better luck if they ditched Ubisoft and started a Kickstarter project to fund the game. Ubisoft makes you their ♥♥♥♥♥es and you have to see your work covered in a piece of ♥♥♥♥ like UPlay. I have no interest in playing anymore of your game.\n\nOVERALL: If you REALLY want to play this... I'd recommend pirating this game than buying it. Ubisoft will blame their ineptitude on piracy anyways. The executives are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Buy LoG I and II.\n","December 22, 2014","false","0.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I think that is something they should address in a patch asap as it makes the game insanely annoying.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RyuMarksmen/recommended/238750/","RyuMarksmen","Ryu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RyuMarksmen/","155 products in account","TL:DR - This is not a faithful recreation at all. The clostest thing you get is the freedom to make your own party of characters and even this is very limited. Besides that, you are moving along with a grid-based world, permentally stuck in turn-based combat. In a world that punishes exploration.\n\n===Combat===\nCombat is all turn-based. If you and an enemy are right next to each other, you cannot move. This means that once you engage in combat, You're stuck. No leaving. No retreating. And this becomes a serious problem when you start to explore. You will go to areas that you are not prepared for. And You will get into combat with things you cannot fight. And You can't run. You will die... For exploring... In an open world RPG that encourages you to explore. The previous might and magic games have made it possible. But the problem is the addition of this grid based combat/exploration. In previous games, you could go to an impossible difficulty area, and the first attack kills a party member. You turn, and run away. Maybe lose another party member to a stray shot. But you can still run away and escape. Nothing bound you, like a grid does here. If an enemy engages you in melee combat, you're stuck exchanging blows. No smart manuvering or tactical fighting like in previous games or in legend of grimmock.... No, make your attacks, take your blows, repeat until you or the enemy is dead.\n\n===Exploration===\nAs mentioned previously, you are punished for exploring if you happen to end up in an area you cannot fight in. You have to use that quick save... Alot. Its not even fun to explore. Everything is grid based. So you will find boundaries, and areas that look like you can go through but you can't because the grid says you can't go here. It's a massive step down from the previous games where you could scale mountions, fly above and look at the whole world, or jump into the water and risk drowning to discover cool treasures. Heck, it was rewarding to go exploring in areas, that your party wasn't prepared for, to grab some of the loot there. None of that in this game.","July 6, 2015","false","11.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

This may not be everyone's cup of tea but if you like a good old-fashioned dungeon crawl, no other modern titles can touch this.\n\nGraphics: The graphics are good but the performance is a bit spotty. Still, if you ever wanted to try an old school dungeon crawler but were put off by the graphics, this will help you get into them.\n\nSound: The sound is wonderful. The music, the voices, the effects, etc all work well.\n\nStory: These are not the kinds of games you play for story purposes. Still, if you bother to read all the text, there is a decent story there. There are even texts you can find to figure out the back story of the world or characters.\n\nGameplay: This is where the game scores the highest marks. There are 4 races with 3 classes per race. You assemble a team of 4 from those choices. This makes the game immensely replayable. I have just finished the second act and am already planning my Hard mode playthrough.\n\nAlso, the game has many nice touches. It has mechanics to limit rest abuse. Potion overuse is limited by hefty potion costs. Over-levelling is slightly limited by the lack of respawns.\n\nOverally, I love this game.

Wrong.  Honestly, I love and hate this game.  I've played every M&M game before this, (6 being my absolute fave) and am a devoted fan of the series.  But people, this game is EXCEPTIONALLY buggy.  I'm a pretty patient person.  I overlook a lot.  But I have had to start over *3* times because of various bugs.  Once there was supposed to be a rusty key dropped by a couple of guards.  NO key, NO progress.  I killed the guards, the guards did not drop it.  No way to move forward.  Start over.  Once the game "lost" my saves.  Star over.  Once the game decided not to let me back into a castle I needed to get into.  Start over.  Then I decided to write this review.  This game will be super fun after a few patches.  It needs work on almost everything. Textures are awful, pop ups appear and disappear, NPCs and followers do not behave as they are supposed to, save games disappear and if you save and reload you may lose things from your inventory, IMPORTANT things  Go read the Ubisoft forums before you pay 25 bucks for this game.  Wait 6 months for the next 3 or 4 patches to go online.  I feel cheated and it's not fun.  If they fix this stuff, I would recommend it wholeheartedly.  If you have the time and patience to restart 3 or 4 times in the HOPES that you might be able to complete, go for it.  But don't say I didn't warn you.","February 5, 2014","false","97.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","3"

It's a testament to how good the game itself is that one can put up with the horrid technical implementation of this game.  I mean, it's a turn based RPG with decent for the style graphics, and there's no execuse for how crappy the game performs when you're out and about in the world, or the insanely long loading times.  You would almost have to intentionally code something intentionally poorly to reach these lows and the fact that zero attempt was ever made to patch in optimization is pretty sad.\n\n","December 21, 2014","true","24.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

No customization, which is ok here, but they only give you four portraits to choose from for each race, and that includes male and female, so it's really just the dark haired male/female, or the light haired male/female.  Interestingly you can choose all four of your party members with the same race/class/skills/portrait if you choose and have a quadruplet party.  But this is a solid RPG at its core.

You basically go to any area possible, get killed by the first mob or barely survive, then have to find the next area where you might possibly be able to advance.\nDifficulty spikes evenly at moments, for example you get a few solitary mobs for a while and then a pack of 2 and an elite with them which makes the fight annoyingly hard early on.\nBoss fights are also unbalanced. You might be able to complete their dungeon without pain, and still have to keep away from them,  go somewhere else leveling and getting better equipment, then come back for a hard fight.\nThe mix of multiple mob levels in a single dungeon is also a pain as you are always saving before taking a step in another direction (level 10 in a area and level 15+ not far from it depending on another quest).\n\nI don't like the map designs, with at times just annoying path blockers, put there for no apparent reason, and towns are too big (while it makes for a real town for a grid based game it makes it a labor to travel the streets).\nOverall design quality isn't really good and game is unoptimized. Running into the forest and jungle kills FPS to a stop.\n\nStory wise you get a common story which is neither good nor bad per se.\nClasses are limited and some are apparently almost useless, like the defender which sacrifices damage for a shield but can't use his tanking skills on any boss and a number of mobs\nBug wise I only had a inconvenience with sound, after 8 hours of game time the combat music wouldn't stop but would be piled upon the last one after each new fight. Reloading or changing map restores the usual sound until the next fight (which isn't hard as you always reload anyway).","October 9, 2015","false","11.2"," 7 of 16 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","7","16","0","0"

Some of the worst aspects are combat related, such as being locked into combat and no monsters are in the local area, a bug that STILL has not been fixed, this particular bug occurs because of the ridiculously decision to make the combat turn based, where as the previous games was all psedo-turn based meaning you could move your party/pause the game and attack.   MMx locks you into a fight to the death once monsters reach a certain distance from your character, unfortunately I've had this bug out far too many times forcing a reload to a previous point to fix - not to mention this particular type of combat also punishes the players rather harshly against ranged monsters, because you sometimes can't move into melee range!! Absurd but true!!  Honestly - the person who thought up this mechanic should be fired because its one of the serious gamebreaking issues MMx has.\n\nIf your a veteran of the MM series, you'll know that skill points are valuable but in previous games you had somewhat leeway into making some mistakes with your builds, MMx forces you into very specific builds and characters classes otherwise you could literally become stuck in game without the ability to progress either because of bosses being too difficult or some encounters completely overpowering your characters, so creating your party requires very careful planning and even more careful skill point allocation.\n\nAnother major problem MMx is balance, or lack off it.  The balance problems are so bad that I don't think the game was ever playtested properly.   Overall game difficulty is another issue as it wildly increases/decreases, for instance you don't know the level of any monsters and since they cut corners with monsters design (they just re-color) the difference in color of a monster could mean that you have your entire party one-shotted or you one-shot the monster.  But for the most part, you'll die ALOT when exploring, so save literally before every encounter.  Because a typical scenerio when exploring is...kill basic monsters...no problems...oh new monster!! Game Over...reload, avoid area until higher level, it happens far too often which makes me wonder if this development team ever played any of the original might and magic games...\n\nI could write on and on about all the complaints and issues I have with this game, but this is one of those games you're either going to love it, or hate it.  I just don't recommend this game to anyone who easily gets frustrated.  It is also especially time consuming because MMx also suffers from excessive loading, with entering buildings/inns...loading...enter/leaving areas...more loading...entering dungeons/new floors...more loading.\n\nBasically, This game needs to have the movement lock removed as that would solve many of the issues.","January 8, 2015","false","9.9"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

I find that the "open world" that was advertised in the store page to be deceitful. Infact, the game is quite linear. There isn't much room for customization of the party because if you do not have a star squad, boss fights are impossible and you will have to restart the whole game with a better party configuration. Because the game has a linear progression you cannot prepare your party to mitigate the boss fights.\n\nThe difficulty wasn't what was most appalling, it was the bugs. I would have to restart or reload saves killing a good hour or two of progress to fix a bug. The most annoying of the bugs that occurs the most is the combat music overriding all other sounds.

The grid based movement is reminiscent of the previous M&M games of yesteryear, but that is where it pretty much ends.\n\nThere is very little content.. what is there is generally boring. There is not a large skillset and the story is rather bland.\n\nThe textures and gameworld look like they were from the MM 3-4 era, which was intentional by the developers. However, that seems like a bad decision. The gameplay elements of the older games was great, the graphics not so much.. updating the graphics and providing some rich looking worlds would have went a long way to improve the overall immersion in the game.\n\nThere are three towns and only 20 dungeons - that's a very small area to explore and overall, the content is around 20-30 hours of gameplay. That seems weak for any game in the M&M series.\n\nModding support for the game is almost non-existent unless you are an indie developer with a Unity3D Pro license ($1500 - if you want one..) So, don't expect alot of community mods.\n\nThe only good side is that it has a reduced price tag.. But even at $25, its still over priced for what you get. You are better of picking up a dos box and one of the older games in the series - atleast they have less bugs and a solid story.","January 26, 2014","false","15.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Keep that in mind when reading the rest of the review.\n\nMight and Magic X is basically a turn-based hack-and-slash game, and it's strength lies in providing a slightly more cerebral version of the Diablo-like experience: kill waves of monsters with sword and spell, loot the corpses (considerately done automatically in this case), level up and get new powers with which to kill monsters, rinse, repeat. There are people who give you quests, but they're not especially memorable in terms of personality or backstory. Your own characters are flat generic PCs. There a main plot involving insurrection and hidden puppetmasters, and as best I can discern it doesn't have any gaping holes, but it doesn't reach the level of the Dragon Age franchise, much less something like Fallout or Bloodlines. It does, however, provide plenty of turn-and-grid-based combats against enemies with somewhat varied abilities, plus plenty of PCs to customize and difficult, meaningful choices about how to allocate skill points (the source of many of my own considerable play hours.)\n\nIn general, MM X delivers the turn-based tactical-RPG goods. In particular, however, there are a number of annoyances that detract from the experience:\n\n-OCD is mandatory. you need spells of Clairvoyance, Light, Whispering Shadows, a way to repair damaged gear (difficult when in the middle of the wilderness), antidotes and/or Cure Poison, one character with Might primary, one with Magic, one with Perception, etcetera, etcetera. Neglecting any particular little thing will at the very least cost you some opportunities and at most court a Total Party Kill\n\n-Hard fights aren't smart fights. Especially hard fights don't require that much tactical sophistication- once you've got a schtick your party can reliably resort to, for instance focusing fire on one enemy while Dark Magic users neutralize the other ones with Sleep, you just have to go through the motions. That means doing the same thing turn after turn, occasionally guzzling potions (of which you will need many). Most of the thinking goes into allocating your characters' skill points when leveling them up, before combat begins.\n\n-Take a wrong turn and die. Non-linear game worlds with difficult areas available early can be good things. The problems here are that a) there's relatively little indication of what you're getting yourself into, and b) you can't retreat from a fight (barring, maybe, one or two high-level spells that let you), which means saving and reloading. Think Skyrim, if you didn't have the option of running away from the big ugly like your pants were on fire and instead had to stand next to him trading blows until you drop, or just reload.\n\nThe game has somewhat more good points than bad, enough to hope that the studio will correct these faults to produce a more enjoyable Might and Magic XI","January 31, 2015","true","137.2"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

My issue is more that they got all the small details wrong:\n- Hit animations and sounds play *before* the attack dice have been rolled, so basically you see characters die, explosion happen, ...BEFORE the main attack animation has even started. That makes the combat frustrating to say the least.\n- The characters are talking, which is nice, except it was done very badly: When my warrior is stunned, when my magician is dead, I don't want to hear them complain about whatever happen next or point out that they are tired and that we should sleep.\n- The design involves a lot of instant death, so basically you have to quick save a lot because your next step may just be the last one, and there was no way to know that. People who call that "oldskool" don't know what they are talking about. The olsdkool variant is as deadly, but in general designers left you some hints that you were going to have your ♥♥♥ handed to you :p\n- The loot distribution is abysmal, there's no link between the difficulty of a fight, the fact that the objects are well hidden in a super remote place,... it may still be a pointless non magic item.\n- The whole RPG system is broken. Skills almost don't matter, all that matters is that you can resist whatever is thrown into your face, which means magic shields and armors, resistance buffs, and protections against stunning, weakness, sleep, etc... the rest does not really matter.\n- Linking the progression of skills with the story events is so unfair... if you picked up some classes or weapons, you will not be able to level them up until way later in the game because you can't access the trainer you need for the skill.\n- The inventory system is bad (no auto sorting, no auto selling of the trash loot, you can't throw away stuff if you are looting (you have to close the chest, open the inventory, throw away whatever you wanted, then go back to the chest and finish looting)\n\nIn conclusion I would say that it was a good attempt tech wise, but that the game design was bad, even the story was just generic fantasy with M&M typical characters while totally missing on the less traditional canon (that involves robots and spaceships.)\n\nTry at your own risk.","February 22","false","77.8"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

The difficulty spikes in odd places to unplayable levels then lowers to easy for no apparent reason. The loading times are insane for a game of limited quality. The mini map is very poor and there is no way to back out of combat without reloading. If a game needs a narator for more than the opening sequence more though needs to be put into the story. Lastly the character portraits should change as you upgrade your equipment.

Sound effects are simple and repetitive.\n\nPlayability: ★★★★☆\nEasy controls and interface like its predecessors.\n\nEntertainment: ★★★☆☆\nIf your familiar with games of the past like the Wizardry series or the Might & Magic games, you will love this title as it takes you down memory lane but for those who are new to these type of games may get bored as the gameplay may get repetitive.\n\nReplay Value: ★★★★☆\nI feel the game has a High replay value especially since your party consists of 4 members and there are a total of 12 possible Classes to mix and match with the 4 races.\n\nOverall Rating: ★★★½☆☆\n\n\n\nMY PERSONAL REVIEW\n\n\nThe Game takes place a few years after the events of Might & Magic: Heroes VI. Might & Magic X - Legacy takes place on the Agyn Peninsula. It's a throwback to the hack-and-slash RPGs of old and no knowledge of the past series is required to play it. You can create a Four person party consisting of 4 Races and 12 Classes to select from. While the party size is locked at four, players can pick up additional hirelings to fill specialized needs that give certain buffs or the pack horse that adds a considerable amount of inventory space which I found a must. The classes offer lots of skills and spells to choose from. The individual skills can be ranked up starting at novice and going up to Grandmaster. Some of the spells you get at Grandmaster are devastating but the road to get there is a long one. If you liked the Diablo style loot drops than you’ll like this game as there is a ton of different types of loot. The game adds some puzzle and riddle solving to take away from the constant combat grind.  Players can roam towns to find various power ups, coins, and quests that send them out into the wilderness. The game offers about 60+ Hours of play time if you explore every nook and cranny and take the time to read all the Lore it offers. This game is nothing like the Heroes of might & Magic series but if you liked games of the past like the Wizardry or Eye of the Beholder series or even the new Legend of Grimrock than this is the game for you.\n\n\n\n","January 31, 2014","true","80.9"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I love this series because of VI. I don't know why M&M X come back to I~V. It seems that the production team just lacks money.  M&M X, as the sequel of one of the greatest RPGs in Europe and America, could have been an epic game. Blame UBISOFT. Why can't they invest more money in this series? I remember the time when I was addicted to playing M&M VI for two whole weeks. Afterall, it's just an early edition. I'm still looking forward to some improvement.\n=====================================================================\nNow the official edition has released. I find this game is just okay after I have played for several hours. There are two points that should be improved. The first one is the inventory. Weapons shouldn't only be icons like M&M IX. It is very disappointing when we defeat boss and get loots whose apperance we can only see from pictures. The second one is about our characters' heads at the bottom. More expressions and actions should be added in order to increase sense of indentification. These two points are also the essence of M&M.\nOverall, its not too bad. It would be a great game if it was made for smart phone.\n6/10","December 29, 2013","false","30.7"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","4","11","0","0"

The graphics are extremely dated, and not in a charming way (this game came out in 2014? srsly? Oblivion came out in 2006 and its graphics blow this away!). I have seen indy titles with better graphics and effects, I expect more from an AAA studio. The interface is clunky, wtf is up with the weird "tile based" movement system? You are stuck on a grid?!? What is this? Might and Magic II? MM6, 7, 8 and 9 had no problem letting the party freely move and look around, you toggled "turn based mode" on and off when needed. This game locks it on runs the world every time you step into the next grid tile (you know the way the old DOS 1-Xeen Might and Magic games did...). The character races, classes and skills are pretty basic and lack the options and depth of the games predicessors. It's like they decided to try to capture the look and feel of old titles but managed to capture all the negative things about them with none of the positive.\n\nI haven't played much but I already noticed several assets are recycled from previous games... Mostly sound effects that are from MM6, 7, 8. Several of the jingles, the sound of the quest log opening and closing, the sound of drinking potions are all from the old games. It is laughable and only makes me wish I was replaying one of the old titles.\n\nI mean... Might and Magic VIII Day of the Destroyer, a game that came out in the year 2000 had 7 base classes, plus 7 promotion classes, plus the dragons. MMX basically has 3... a "warrior" a "hybrid" or a "caster" and the class is a bit different depending on race. VIII had 35 unique skills, X has 25 and they aren't very creative. Your wizard can't even grand master all of the magic spells. VIII had very distinct magic skills, the 4 elemental magics were for wizards, the three "self" magics were for healers and the light\dark were shared (there was also class specific magic...) This game, I am not sure exactly how to distinguish between a healer and a caster, you don't seem to start with any healing spells. The previous few games were cool because you could explore the world freely in real time and then press "enter" to go into turn based mode when needed; you didn't feel like you were locked to a rigid grid.\n\nAlso, dare I say, the graphics are almost better in 6\7\8. I mean sure they are low res pixelated sprite based images mostly but at least the characters wander around in real time, with a walk cycle. Your characters move their lips when they talk (yeah, no one moves their lips at all in X... it is sometimes hard to tell who is talking). It was a bit primative but at least it was easy on the eyes. Even MM3 through Xeen looked good, in a cartoony oldschool DOS way (and in Xeen the characters moved their lips when they spoke.) MM1 and MM2 had crap graphics, grid based game play and you had to draw your own maps (sort of) but they came on 5 1\4 floppies so they get a pass.\n\nPlus, no game since 6\7\8 has had the awesome inventory and equipment equip screens that 6\7\8 had. You could actually see what the thing in your inventory looked like and when you put it on your character they actually looked like they were wearing or using that item. MM9 and X went back to the oldschool "list of items" method and little squares to put the items in to equip them.\n\n6\7\8 had a few animated cutscenes, and they were animated well for their time. This game has an extremely long intro, plus another 10 minutes of naration as soon as the game starts and it is all told with still images and voice overs with characters that can't move their lips.\n\nThe only thing that X seems to have taken from 6\7\8 is some ripped off audio assets.\n\nAdd to all of this the "wonderful" experience of having to use UPlay... F-ck UPlay. It took quite an effort just to get this game to launch on my PC (among other things I had to sign up for a 3rd UPlay account because for some reason they can't find my old credentials) and - it wasn't worth it.\n\nThe Might and Magic series peaked with 6, 7 and 8. 9 was OK. X is pretty bad.\n\nGo back to remaking "Heroes" clones Ubisoft! If this was an Indy title I would cut it some slack but... come on, this is Ubisoft, the guys who brought us Assasins Creed and Far Cry. Ubisoft and Limbic Entertainment are way above "Indy" level developers. I haven't been this disapointed with a game with the title Might and Magic since Dark Messiah. These guys are making me start to consider MM9 as one of the "good" Might and Magic games... (and I used to hate that game! Well, hate is a strong word. Strongly dislike is more like it.) I miss 3DO and New World Computing. They would have never let this happen.\n\nDamn, writing this review has made me want to go back and replay the good Might and Magic games.","August 20, 2015","false","0.4"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","20","1","5","0","0"

The Xeen series is clearly the main inspiration for this title and the various RPG systems in the game interact effectively to create a compelling and addictive experience.\n\nExploring the world and discovering new locales is really enjoyable although the graphics are relatively cut-rate compared to similar titles.  Some locations look more impressive than others.  The dungeons in particular are quite well-designed, but the overworld and towns lack visual cohesion and suffer from occasional performance hiccups.\n\nThe combat is the meat of the game and  is purely tactical.  Enemies have a variety of abilities to keep you on your toes.  Don't settle into any one tactic or rely on key-spamming, you constantly have to adapt your abilities to the foes at hand.\n\nThe lore and world building gets the job done, although exposition is occasionally heavy-handed and long-winded.\n\nThe grid movement system may feel constrained at first, but if you think of the game more like a series of large chess-like game boards, it makes more sense.  Simplifying the spacialization of enemies and move options to a grid forces you to make specific choices over what you can do spatially in combat - a good thing for a game of relatively modest scope.\n\nThe main point I want to get about this game is that, as much as the game wants you to, you don't have to look at it through a nostalgia lens.  The RPG systems and tactical combat that hold this game together transcend both the weight of history that hangs over the series and expectations from fans of the genre.\n\nCome in with the right amount of expectations and you'll find that the developers acheived what they set out to do: bring the essense of what made the old Might games such a joy to play and put it in a modern context.

Nothing near the greatness of MM6-8, not even match the 9. It's more like older games in this series but with far more primitive roleplay system with very limited class variation. You can only turn in 90 degrees. No movement during the combat. Very cheap looking graphics and animation, sound recycled from earlier games... yeah and guess what? no MM6 in deluxe version.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Whiteswart/recommended/238750/","Whiteswart","Whiteswart","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Whiteswart/","1424 products in account","Yeah, I’ve played this game for 100+ hours, finished it 5 times, get almost all achievements… Yet I disregard it. Why?\n\nWell, all blame goes to Ubisoft, and two major points for I don’t recommend that game are:\n-	a wrong key feature policy (bad plan), and\n-	Insultingly high price, considering how low-tech, and limited in capacity that volume is.\n\nWhat is wrong key feature policy, you may ask? Well, that game proposes itself as HardCore and Oldschool. That’s the point for that I want to crush skulls and jaws. You see, using the old mechanic is not making the game oldschool. Forfeiting base common tricks, like adjustable map or in-game notepad, does not making it hardcore.\n\nThe main reason for what people love old games is not about any type of mechanics. It is about passion! Guys who made those old games on their knees, in the dusty garages, but with full care a parent can give to its child – where every piece in every place is literally hand-made – that’s for people getting old-school. When Finnish Almost Human studio hit the shelves in the 2012 with the Legend of Grimrock, their game was praised not for using sluggish square-based movement. No, please! It was all about good combination of long-known tricks with the creativity and that famous “from gamers to gamers” drive.\n\nMight and Magic X Legacy in fact is just a tribute to old 3DO hits, snatchingly made by a small amateur game studio Limbic for a paycheck, and then sold as a full-scale hit by Ubisoft.\n\nNow, I don’t think that subsidiarity is a bad idea. It is one of the basic principles of the European Union, for example. But sometimes subsidiarity is not a good option. So rich is the fan-base of the old Might & Magic series! It is certainly have no less admirers than Deus Ex. Were Might and Magic X Legacy a stand-alone project, with some different name (Legend of Eryn, why not?) – I’d only recommend it. But as an inheritor of the whole serial… it is not even a basttard, it is an impostor.  When I’m hearing its name, it sounds to me like, “Leo Romanoff, the right heir to the Russian throne”.\n\nThat’s all about two major aspects, for which I’m turning it down. Now, the base routine: normal review for a game without such big name.\n\nWhat we have is a first-person view RPG with tile-based movement (like in the M&M 1-5 or the Legend of Grimrock). There go some fans of M&M 6-8… I know some of them, and they don’t happy about that turn. What I didn’t like about that style of movement is that I constantly losing the track. Especially if the background is not flat, like in the Crag town. When you climbing up there, it is cool. But when you have to descend… you can’t look down! So you move, but don’t see where, because you don’t see ground! Un-natural, that concept is.\n\nThe battle system is turn-based, of course: you have four of your characters, you make a move for every of them, then comes enemies, and so on, one for one. While challenge in those turn-based combats is quite high sometimes, the bad thing is that it is very clumsy in any case where you not strong enough just to click enemy to death with single attack. It goes about applying your characters skills via game interface. Yeah, you have 10 buttons, 5 already binded (1-melee, 2-shot, 3-block, and 2 buttons for red and blue potions). Another 5 buttons are yours to bind, but boy, that’s so far from enough!\n\nAfter you get about 10-15 level, you’ll be constantly using sub-subdirectories to make every move for every character. I always thought that western PC RPG stands above JRPG like Final Fantasy, when we speaking about normalcy, convenience of combat performing. Alas, the turn-based fight in the M&M X is worse than in your normal JRPG. In the most of the battles it feels like romp in the mud.\n\nThe story? Nothing spectacular. Go from A to B, then to C, return to A, to B, another round with new mail quest, and another. Wait! Twist! (bonfires) And go for another 3 rounds between A, B and C!\n\nThere are too little place for decent amount of adventuring. Some locations are blowing my mind, but in the bad way. You go through a tomb full of ghouls and ghosts, managing through some part of it, and then – whoa! – you’re meet humans. Not necromancers. You think, well, I finished the tomb part; there is a Rubicon, now it is a human dungeon. You reconfiguring your skills to fit the fencing with humans, then hop! Another ghost attack! No logical explanation, what people and undead doing jointly, but they’re performing some cohabitation. Why? Well, not because it is a great plan of some kind. There are simply not enough place for two dungeons and variety of enemies for every maze you’ll have to see on your way through.\n\nGame falls low shortly after start. It is unnatural, bleak, and the only good point in it is the retro battle system, which gives you some trial to see if you’re fit to old standards. Oh, wait, I’ve already said that that system is clumsy and broken there! So – generally – there are no point to start it, at all!\n\nIf only to cherish your curiosity… Save your time, don’t bother. My mark is 6/10.\n\nPS: I've almost forgot, but this is important piece: the sound in the game is its worst part. After about two hours of playing I was urged to shut down the voices, then, after I've got to Seahaven, I switched off the ambient, and it was not long until I totally mute the game and played only with my own soundtrack on background. What's so bad? Buzzing sounds. That's a total disaster, believe me. Limbic should shot their sound engineer, or at least, stop feeding him.","October 15, 2015","false","146.1"," 27 of 60 people (45%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","45","27","60","0","5"

Despite the appearance of an open world the game is strictly linear and poorly designed.  The encounters are of the type where the NPC's frequently get to break the rules in one way or another and the game is not using cheap tricks like having enemies magically appear in areas you just cleared when you enter combat.  If this sort of game interests you I strongly recommend against purchasing this title and suggest you look elsewhere for your entertainment.","April 14, 2014","false","5.3"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

That was one half-finished game, even more so than M&MX. That didn't stop it from being very good, though.\n\nPlay M&MX if:\n\n1) You want an open-world, turn-based and grid-based dungeon crawler.\n\n2) You are fine with thinking about class and party builds ahead of playing the game. M&MX on warrior difficulty is hard, some would say even brutal - even a very strong, metagamey party will get consistently challenged. You can't max out every skill (at most you'll max 3 skills out of 10+ available for each class) so you have to pick and choose carefully as well as making sure that your classes work well together.\n\n3) You can appreciate the fact that it's actually very open. Recently we've been fed fake open-world games like Divinity OS and Xulima where you're actually meant to do things in a very specific order. M&MX handles this aspect very well so that going into a hard area, barely managing it through encounters and coming back some epic loot feels nice and rewarding.\n\nDon't play it if:\n\n1) You want a casual game.\n\n2) You want a faithful clone of Xeen or another M&M6. This is different - though it does borrow a lot of things from the older M&M's, at least style-wise.\n\n2) You hate turn-based, grid-based gameplay.\n\n3) Can't handle bugs, glitches and lack of polish.\n\nHave fun!\n","December 9, 2014","true","50.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This feels more like a Wizardry game than anything, only it does not have random encounters.\n\nIf you're looking for an updated version of M&M 6: The Mandate of Heaven, you're going to notice immediately that combat is turn based instead of action based and that you're not able to cheese the ranged attacks quite the same way you did in the last few titles. This forces the element of difficulty into the game that used to come from having to strategize about when and where to cast spells and run from enemies. Once engaged in melee combat, you can't back away or use exits, and very often you're arbitrarily ambushed and beaten down from behind. This leaves little to no strategy available to the player to decide when and where to engage the enemy. Worse still, every skill you need to progress is gated by leveling up multiple times and collecting money, which there is a limited amount of in the game.\n\nThis entire game feels like it was designed by people who did not play the original series and do not fully understand the mystique and challenge of M&M adventure games. The elements are there but different. Most of the difficulty in this game comes from needing to block or chug potions at the right time. And you can't even equip the best shields available to you in the first town. You have to complete several incredibly difficult dungeons and make it to the second town before you're even allowed to purchase the training to equip them. This makes the fights with tougher enemies frustrating if not outright unfair. Those who would focus on defense to secure the best outcome are punished while people who choose whatever deals the most damage are rewarded; All in all, this is par for the course for turn based games but not balanced the way M&M 1-6 were. Moreover, entire methods of playing the game, such as going with heavy armor and shields, goes completely unrewarded, so there's no point to that portion of the content. You do not have a front-line and a back-line since enemies can reach any of your party members to attack them at any time, so there isn't even signficant incentive to have defensive members balancing against softer damage dealers until halfway into the game when you actually get usable healing spells. By then, you'd have been better off going full barbarian or mage across the board.\n\nThe only genuinely positive part of this experience is that the dungeons and quests all string together nicely like an mmo and it's easy to figure out where to go next just from exploring and poking around on the mini map, talking to people, etc. That and, somehow acknolwedging the limitations of non-respawning chests and enemies, the game apparently dumps loot on you when you find it, so that's nice.\n\nI haven't played a full team of mages like I mentioned earlier yet but I suspect they work much better than the classes I was trying before; And if that is the case, then this is the only great similarity between the original games and this one. Overall, I don't want to take the time to play it anymore after having gotten my butt kicked repeatedly. I'm already too frustrated after a few hours of trudging around in the Lighthouse. The difficulty curve is ridiculous and fights go from being winnable to being totally hopeless, from room to room even. Moreover, there's almost nothing to indicate to you when going in a room or across a bridge will be life threatening so you can never learn from your mistakes. There are even several places you're clearly meant to return to when you're stronger, but how much stronger is somewhere between vaguely incomprehensible and utterly unfathomable. It feels like a big slap in the face when you as a player go in a door that was open to you and can't even escape certain demise because you weren't genuinely going to be allowed an opportunity to succeed at what lay behind it. This kind of high stakes trial-and-error is very unrewarding and disappointing.\n\nUpdate: I have now played with a full team of mages and it's as I suspected. I was able to get this team to the place of progress it had taken hours to get to before within about 30 minutes. Of course once you run into the one thing that's immune to the school of magic you've been focusing on or up the difficulty from normal to hard, you can expect to be back in the boat of unplayable content and frustration. Overall, the game seems to want to force you to have to bring a specific party to accomplish the goals it sets before you. Some doors can't even be found and some passage ways can't even be opened unless a person with a high score in a specific stat is able to locate and/or open them for your team, which means teams lacking that stat may not even be able to progress in certain dungeons at all. This is very detrimental as, 1) it's impossible to know what the recommended (or required) team composition is upfront and 2) playing with any other party composition is apparently almost futile.\n\nTLDR; This is a competent and somewhat fun to play turn-based RPG but has little to nothing to offer those who are fans of M&M6. I'd still like to recommend this one because it's challenging and a classic first person dungeon crawler like Wizardry, but I can't while it's at any price over 10 dollars. The fact that Wizardry 6 is the same kind of game and was slightly better than this despite having come out 24 years ago prevents me from doing so. If you were hoping to have some fun with this one, buy Wizardry Renaissance and play it all the way through first. Then maybe pick this one up and play it out of boredom when it falls below 10 dollars standard price.","December 23, 2014","false","10.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I submitted a helpdesk ticket to ubisoft (I'm on mac, but they apparently don't admit to have a mac version, so I submitted it to the windows help desk) and got a useless response. They basically had me install every OS X update and some flash installers, none of which really helped. I felt like I had just called comcast and the script the "helpful" individual on the other end had them read the same thing, even if it was totally innappropriate.\n\nHowever, I changed my recommendation after following the directions in one of the steam forums. Apparently, this is a 32 bit game and, for mac users, you must find the actual program and mark it as such in order to get decent playability. Once you do, it is fine (though, not a stellar experience). I'm pretty sure Macs have been 64 bit for over 10 years now. But, maybe the code they are using is still 32 bit and they can't afford to have someone actually update it? Even the PC version isn't 10 years old...\n\nThe game plays more or less like the old M&M games that came before it, but with better graphics. Having grown up with games like this, I prefer the turn based combat. There are some real problems, such as situations where the enemy you are fighting doesn't actually appear on your screen. However, you can still blow them away with fireballs, even if you have no clue where they are. I've seen pirates walk through walls to fight you, and combat turns for the opponent can take several minutes as the animations dig through to find you.\n\nAll in all, this is a decent remake of those old school dungeon grinders that were king back in the 90s but modernized for semi modern hardware. If they put some work tuning the engine itself, it would probably be a great iPad or android game.

As a MM fan having played all MM games, this game actually succeeds in capturing the MM charme and spirit! It is nice to level up, train with trainers, and get to Expert, Master and GM status. The game is well balanced, quite difficult at the beginning, so that you will need to come back later for some bosses, and even in late game, remains challenging. The size of the game is nice, also that there are some riddles and puzzles in the dungeons.\nNegative: Graphics outdated, bad decisions in the beginning (many experts, Masters are not accessible until later acts, as they are located in cities you cant access!), a lot of walking around due to lack of decent teleport system; weak presentation of the "story". Last, UPLAY does not work properly if game is bought through Steam... you need to contact Support to be able to get UPlay points and unlock Rewards (worked with al other UPlay gmaes I have).\n\nAll in all, a nice and addicting RPG similar to older MM titles, which could have been grand with a higher budget and a better engine, but delivers on what it tries to be. Too bad it was no success, and likely there will be no future games like this.","January 31, 2015","true","70.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I will definitely play it again in the near future and I await further DLC because one (with a bit hard level of difficulty) is just not enough.

Once computers entered the gaming world a few people wrote games in text only format to entertain the infant market. I even wrote a Star Trek game on the Commodore 64 that was stored on a floppy disk! M&M X is a new game which captures a little of the older, but not as old as that old C64 game I wrote. And thank heaven for that! Greatly improved graphics over past iterations of the M&M world, smoother play, old style movement and enough creatures, bad guys, and other diversions to keep the most stout-hearted adventurer in the game for many hours. This game uses an older type of interface that the younger generation might find "clunky" but this is only because they have no basis for comparison. Humor is always required in an adventure game as are challenges which increase in difficulty level as progress is made make gaming as time consuming blast! The first dragon encountered is very much a challenge worthy of the best warrior party - for this dragon is beautiful but deadly. Cyclops are always a challenge and M&M X gets it right by inserting a cave with a cyclops standing inside the entrance and it carries a club. Your party is in grave danger and there is no leaving the cave until the danger is past...er...dead. Get a horse early and let it carry the extra armor and weapons you collect along the way, leaving your arms free to hold a sword and shiled. Keep gold in your pockets though, horses can't be trusted!\nEasy to play, addictive style that will captivate the most jaded players due to the strangely adaptive A.I., and graphics that are old-school and yet pleasing to the eye -- Might & Magic X: Legacy is a great game! Oh, yeah, and it comes with M&M VI, a definite blast-from-the-past title that will keep you journeying and adventuring for hours on end.","August 9, 2014","true","18.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Reduction of Ressources, Conversion of towns, lack of map dwellings, obvious map patterns and the free skilltree gave me the impression of a very monotonous game, where good improvements like the bosses, an interesting story or the big maps couldn't completly save it for me.\n\nBut what about Might & Magic X now?\nI have to admit, when I first saw the screenshots, I was scared off. Partly because of the bad impressions of HoMM mentioned earlier, partly because I saw the reused Models. It made me worry about a cheaply produced game with repitative ressources.\nHowever. I was wrong!\n\nRight now Im halfway through the game, and it really manages to bring back that positive Dungeon-Crawler-Feeling the past series excelled at. The reused models dont annoy me as much, as I like to watch the fine details on the animations up close, whereas in the far away top-down perspective of HoMM one might have missed a lot. I realize how being able to reuse so much, the developers could focus more on the other aspects of the game, like the gameworld, dungeons and such.\n(Besides reused ressources actualy being a very sustainable way of game development)\n\nThe Difficulty "Warrior" gives me, a very well challenged game, with a precisly adjusted curve of improving enemy stacks, as well as the obligatory "come back when you feel ready" challenges on the way.\nThe skills and abilities are well thought through, and invite you to change your tactics accordingly when fighting different constellations of enemies.\n\nOf course, it is less story/decision-driven as The Witcher or Dragon Age and more focused on battles group VS group, but thats just the good old Might&Magic Series for you. And from my point of view, it is a nice addition to the current array of RPGs.\n\nOne last thing: I do not know about the stability on other systems, but it tends to crash for me. A lot. It started when I entered Act II and since then I crashed ~7 Times with one "freeze of death".\nLuckily a thing you can avoid if you just Quicksave often, and also many crashes seem to happen right after changing a map, after the Autosave is done. Still you gotta have the nerves for it. ;)\n\nThis is a definite recommendation from me. Buy it, and experience the well done newest installment of a series, which I daresay influenced the path of many a RPG gamer.","August 6, 2014","true","62.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So won't get too much into detail, but will cover the basics.\nIt is a overall quite neat game. Taking the classic dungeoncrawl approach and spicing it up a little. While the graphic are notably ripped from heroes 6, I don't mind at all. After all, why waste assets when they have them? And they work well within the world so.\n\nThat said, the game has some MASSIVE flaws, and some small annoyances.\nCan start with the small ones: For starters, there are too few lines of spoken dialog in this. Even with a diverse group, basically 70 % of all lines are identitcal between characters. Not that many, but heck, it's not far from it. They seriously cheaped out on that. The dialog that exist is pretty well done. But yeah, it incredibly fast gets repetitive  the 482'th time. Sometimes you can hear the same line 12+ times per minute. Depending on the situation.\nSecondly it's that, while more of a "read up on it, scrub" thing, your "talent tree" is something you heavily need to invest in, and plan ahead. You're not allowed to just pick it as you go, it became clear to me a bit in that I would have needed to plan my build from the start. As some skills are just far too vital not to have. Like how you literally can't complete certain dungeons without having certain spells and/or immunities.\n\nAnd while mostly a aestetic thing. It feels a bit dumb how you start as this "kinda pro adventuring party" with basically 0 equipment or skills. I get that you have to build your way up, but it's kinda derp how you're these supposedly bad-♥♥♥ "Raiders", and you have some rusty, duct taped gear and barely know how to slap someone xP Not to mention: The game ocassionally forgets your UI, and resests some buttons to the "default" potion combination. Not a big annoyance, but can be a nuisance. Atop that, it seems some of the DLC content is bugged. I cashed in a reward for the deluxe edition package, but the item for it was never delivered, yet it claimed it had been cashed in.\n\n\nNow, for the massive flaws of this game in no particular order: (I was debating a bit wheter or not I would recommend this game, but in the end, it is a nice game. Yes, it will frustrate you a lot. But it has enough enjoyable moments to mostly weigh it up)\n1: The loading times are far too long.  It's not to bad in the start. But later in the game, these become a massive bother. ESPECIALLY as the game refuse to load if you are tabbed out. So you can't enter a dungeon or the like, then tab out, check a few things and tab back in during the up to 30+ second long loadingscreens. This becomes ESPECIALLY annoying due to the next in this list, which will force you to repeatedly re-load over and over and over and over and over. It's just a really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ way to pad on extra hours of gameplay.\n\n2: The RNG creep. I could be that I had a bad party combo. But some enemies just get plain stupid with this. Most of the undead are a great example of this. With one lucky hit, and many enemies seem to have 20-40 % crit chance, they can, and will 1-shot any non-tank party member. Just like that. Poof. And there's nothing you can do about it aside from spam protective spells. Which, makes you unable to attack. While they normally hit for like, 41 damage, when they crit, it can be anywhere from 180-260 damage if they feel like it. And when a ex: magic hero at that level has around 100 hp, they're just toast. So at many places, you just have to save, enter combat, hope RNG doesn't screw you over, if so, load and rinse and repeat. You're not being challanged the least, your patience is just being tested.\n\n3: Broken skills and events. Some abilities don't work on enemies, or are outright broken. Like how if you stun an enemy, they can still retaliate, block and all that. While you aren't allowed to do so if stunned as a character. And there's dozens of design flaws like that around. And some events break when you save at a particular palce or time. Like, one event in a crow temple, an entire encouter crashes and vanishes if you save after you talk to a spirit. Which mind you, is a place with the issue in 2 mentioned. So you have to save before you talk to them. Talk to them, enter fight and hope each turn you don't have the ~5-10 % chance of getting instantly killed and be force to load, while you try to take down 6 enemies  at both sides of you with like, 1500 hp each. Each one of these capable to 1 shot your non-tanks. Currently at that fight as I am writing this, and have been for around 2 hours, 1 of which has just been pure loading time.\n\nFor a game so heavily reliant on QS and QL, this type of droll padding just isn't acceptable. I'd at most expet 5-10 second loading time, at most. Many parts of this game is pure trial and error via RNG. Atop that, you only get experience for enemies if a hero is alive, and without and negative condition on them. Like what? My mage didn't learn anything at all from figthing a dragon, just becuase she got backhanded by said dragon and stunned, and her magical boots managed to kill the dragon? She had to be fully aware and witness as the dragon died, or else the entire fight was just some dull pasttime she couldn't learn anything from?\n\n4: No ability to flee. For a game that places it's level 20 monsters next to it's level 1 obligatory giant rats. This is such a huge design flaw I don't even know what to say... It's like removing/not including a dodge or block manouver in a fighting game... like, the actual murloc? This ties heavily in with the save/load issue. As, every time you find something new or a new area, you are forced to save to know if you even are allowed to be there, before you head on in. Your entire party got 1-shotted by a magically farting spider? Welp, you better load then, possinly after being forced through a game over screen, to then be made to wait a total of 1 minute before you are allowed back in. It's just not acceptable as said with the massive amounts of lazy padding this game has. It's like... it's a great game in here, why was so much bad descisions stuffed into it? Despite this being a late, patched version of the game. I really fear how terrible it must have been at launch.  There's seriusly a good game in here. It's just brutally hampered by multiple poor choices and design errors.\n\nI think this wraps up most of it... but yeah. I'd perhaps give a 6.5 out of ten? Nice game, but far too often just plain frustrating. Just knowing that "Oh, I see my tactic and team was irrelevant here, I just wans't lucky enough with the dice rolls to progress... better spend a mintute reloading the... not saying RNG is always bad. But when it becomes a major part of the game itself... it's just frustarting. Adding numbers or making the AI cheat just to upp the difficulty is just poor design. Yes, I know it's sort of "needed"sometimes, but it's very tacky regardless. There's just far too many areas where you're simply not allowed to do anything to affect the outcome of things. Or would have had to play the game prior to know which things to bring where.","November 6, 2015","true","82.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I am a huge Might & Magic fan and I always go back to mm6, mm7 and mm8.\nThe game kinda stays in the same category and it can be a pleasant experience.\n\nThere are a few things which put me off :\n\n1. Grid based movement. I mean 3DO build a world where you could move freely and so many years later Ubisoft can't do the same ? Really bad.\n\n2. The game is very small and the story lacking compared to any previous game.\n\n3. No flying !\n\n4. The biggest turn off for me was the complete lack of gear display. In any M&M game you could see the appearance of your character changing with every piece of gear equipped. You could what an armour looks like, on your character. This is actually very important for an RPG game. M&M X - no, sorry, w can't allow you to see that.\n\n5. skill advancement is blocked so you can't invest points as you could before. Once you hit the max level in a skill that's it, rogression stopped.\n\nAll these things aside, the game is fun and worth playing. It can be challenging especially on warrior difficulty.

So, let's discuss it's progency, for a moment.\n\nThe game owes it's existence to the joyful Legend of Grimrock, which did a great job updating the games of my youth.  MMX is an even more direct throwback to the original Bard's Tale in 1985.  The Bard's Tale took Wizardry and added outdoor areas.  Sure, they weren't that different -- they were basically dungeons with sky blue tiles as opposed to underground grey and brown tiles, but the effect worked on me.\n\nIf you have some nostalgia for the early days of RPG gaming, this will likely hit a home run.  It reminds me of playing games on my Apple II, even including watching the graphics render.  What I really enjoyed most was developing my characters and watching them become increasingly powerful.  I wanted them well prepared for the final battle, and there are many opportunities to improve their skills and their loot.\n\nPros:\n- RPG nostalgia\n- Good skills and character development options\n- Good magic system\n- The individual quests and dungeon were mostly fun\n- Combat is well done\n- To me, at least, the game is almost perfectly balanced (with the stock party).  Only toward the end did I begin to feel overpowered.  Most of the game, the battles were close and tense, but rarely did my entire party die.\n- Great opportunities for exploration -- there is always something new to find\n- No monster respawns!!  Once you clear an area, it stays clear.  I like that.\n\nCons:\n- Graphics look good, but take a long time to render.  At one point, the landscape renders well before the castle sitting on the landscape renders.  That's just weird.\n- Members have your party have comments about everything going on around them.  I love that.  Except that they repeat the same things over and over and over again.  We get it... human cities are as dangerous as the jungle.  Let's move on.  When characters finish a major battle, they cheer an entirely disingenuous "Yay!"  It sounds exactly like a bunch of poorly paid actors sitting around their home microphones trying to appear enthusiastic.\n-  With some exceptions, most of the battles use pretty much the same tactics.  I had the same criticism of Dragon Age.  So this game is not unique, in this regard.\n\nI've invested about 55 hours into this game.  And I had a lot of fun doing it.  If you have  a soft spot in your heart for the RPG dungeon-crawling heyday of the 80s, I think you'll really enjoy this.  I sure did.\n\n","July 19, 2015","true","69.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game has a few frustrating elements put there by the developers. Poison will kill you, and quite quickly, and you get no warning that you need to get earth magic's cure poison or buy antidotes before you get poisoned the first time, although hopefully you will have picked up enough antifotes to be okay. Secondly, while both the team and monsters are locked in space when they enter a melee fight (which is fine), there is one boss that doesn't, and who is going to push the team to their death if the I guess random number generator wills it. Lastly, a couple of things are very difficult to find, and there's no abundance of hints to where to go and the voice acting isn't that great.\n\nApart from that, Might and magic X is a truly brilliant game. You start off choosing a team of four characters whose skills will complement each other on their Quest through the Agyn peninsula. From there on, everything is grid and turn based. You will move square by square through an astonishing world with a lot, really a lot, of cool secrets you may have to go out of your way to find. The game is really well made for people who like to explore places, as the world is big, and the only thing keeping you from going places are monsters. You will need to save often, as you may be ambushed by too difficult monsters in the early game, but even really difficult monsters can often be overcome if you employ the right strategy. Mages are given powerful but costly control options, and there are lots of different strategies to employ to get past the bad guys. Being turn based, you can even change your equipment during your turn in combat, yielding very interesting options if you stack up on cool equipment. This results in a lot of digressions from the tasks at hand; the party will find a new nook or cave they want to explore while on their way to the next location. Except for interdependent quests, you can mosttimes do any quest you have in any order you'd like.\n\nWhile difficult monsters can often be overcome with the right tactics (or a couple of levels, there are always other things you want to do in the mean time), easy monsters can often kill the party if you don't pay attention. The simplest monsters give 5 xp, the toughest give you around 50, so you will never feel that you are too strong for an area, you simply spend less turns during each combat.\n\nOne of the aspects that really got me in this game was all the puzzles. All the way through the land they have put mysterious crypts, where you need to solve a puzzle to get to the treasure, with no dangerous monsters to distract you. There are a lot of chests which requires you to answer a riddle correctly, and they are very fun to ponder about, especially if you're playing together with someone. I already said there are a lot of treasure in this game, and it is sometimes hidden due to the movement in the game. If there's a chest to your side, you won't notice it unless you face that direction, and as you can't face every wall all the time, you need to keep looking for small boxes or camuflaged chests you need to face.\n\nFor the level system, I think it's good. every level gives you 4 attribute points, to be spread over strength, perception, destiny, magic, etc. with very clear effects. This makes sure your character gets better at what he/she does at every level. The character also gets 3 skill points, which can be spent on increasing skills. All the skills a character chan choose between, he/she can master to different degrees, expert (at 7 skill points), master (at 15) and grand master (at 25). At these scores, advancement needs to be bought from a skill specific trainer, which will give an extra boost and let the character advance further. There are 12 classes to choose between, and each has a different set of skill mastery possibilities, but each class needs to get promoted through a special quest to access gm training (range -> warden can gm bow, barbarian -> warmonger can gm two handed), so the game really makes you work to become better. I already mentioned that mages have interesting battle control options; the fighters also do. There's a skill called warfare, which grants spell like abilities (two more at each new level of mastery) like reducing armor or taunting enemies to attack that particular character. This makes any kind of team viable, and gives the game a lot of replay value. When I say any kind of team is viable, I mean it, character creation is not something you need to ponder a lot on, there will be ways to destroy every enemy with what you want to play. Also, at gm level, you will be insanely good, and your party will feel like living gods. This feels great.\n\nI had a lot of fun all the way through this game. They have managed to scare me through sending enemies on me that I didn't think I could handle, they have given me riddles and puzzles I didn't feel like I could handle, but I did, and it was great. If anything is too hard or obscure, you can always google it, you will still enjoy the world of asha. Turn based and grid based games aren't for everyone, and it's difficult to do it well. I hated legend of grimlock, as the movement was annoying, and you could kick difficult bosses asses by figuring out their movement patterns. What they did badly, MMX has done in a very smooth way. Id you liked the stroy part of Heroes VI, then you'll love this game, as they expand upon it with great pieces of lore scattered around (and a story that follows in the footstep of Heroes VI). If you played the old games, you will definitely love this one, as they have included lord Kilburn and Crag Hack, as well as lore about "Lord Caneghem".","April 28, 2014","true","34.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I believe Might & Magic X is a great game (considering also its low budget), and a worthy successor to the older ones of the series. The gameplay still remains very addictive, true to its roots and personally, I find the graphics pretty good considering that high - end visual results is not something you are looking for in a game like this. If you are a fan of the Might & Magic universe (or the good old turn-based RPGs) you really have to try this one. If not... this is your chance people! This game is really worth it! ;)\n\nP.S. I really enjoyed Legend of Grimrock, but I think its not fair to compare it to Might and Magic X having in mind that the combat system in LoG is actually real-time. I believe LoG and M&M X are two very different games, both really great and worth playing!","February 13, 2014","true","43.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For me, it was a great part of the fun of MMX - for other players this might be a turn-off.\n\n+ Thoughtful management of your character's attributes and new skill points is a must - but it's also very rewarding when you reach a new weapon proficiency or finally master a new, powerful spell.\n\n+ Decent variety of enemies, though there are only about two to three different types per dungeon / overworld area. Each type of enemy has different resistances and skills - you have to adapt your attacks / buffs / debuffs accordingly.\n\n+/- Loads and loads of loot, but too often enemies drop only useless stuff (weak weapons and armour for the most part). On the other hand, a decent number of powerful "relics" (weapons, armour) can be found in the most remote and dangerous areas of the game. These relics make a real difference in battle, especially as you can level them up (4 levels each) by simply having them equipped in battle. Levelled up to max, these relics are the most powerful items in the game.\n\n+/- You will often run into enemies who are simply too strong for your characters, requiring you to level up and get some better gear before you return. A classic feature, yes, but this can be annoying if you haven't yes found an area / dungeon where your characters can level up without the constant threat of getting killed by strong mobs.\n\n- Story is okay, delivered mostly by NPC "talking heads" (text only, speech in very rare cases) and books containing background information about the world and its history. Almost no dialogue choices for your characters. All in all, the story of main quest and side quests is serviceable, but not very engaging.\n\n- Quality of character models and textures ranges from "serviceable" to "eyesore".\n\n- No crafting. Would have been nice because too many of the weapons in shops or dropped by enemies are useless.\n\n- As of mid February 2014, annoying bugs still remain (parts of the environment turn invisible, quest rewards not given etc). Your mileage may vary; I did not encounter any quest-breaking bugs.\n\n\nAll in all, I wholeheartedly recommend this games to all fans of classic, turn-based RPGs. It's not perfect and still needs some patching - but there are simply tons of fun to be had while fighting and exploring.","February 13, 2014","true","106.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But the main - the feel of M&M is there, and it's gorgeous. I wouldn't try to compare it to Legend of Grimrock (though the comparisons really jumps to mind), because essentially the things that are great about this game are non-existent in LoG (Lore, colorful world, variety of characters, skills and systems) and vise a versa the things that made LoG great are a bit on the sidelines here (secrets are a plainer system, puzzles are not that convoluted, combat system not dynamic at all (it's actually Turn-based here), I would even say the graphics were a bit more spot on in LoG.\n\nNevertheless, If you have waited for this game: buy it now, you will not regret it.\nIf you haven't waited for this game: check out the videos to see if it's something that you might enjoy and probably give MM 6/8 a whirl first before picking this up, because that's an immortal cllassic.

It even gives the synopsis of the plots for each previous game in in-game lore books while maintaining the new lore and world.\n\nThough character creation is limited to four races with three classes for each race, it's still not as bad as Might Magic XIII's character creation (IDK about you guys but that game had the worst race/class choices in the series). Combat can be a bit buggy at times, the latest patch seems to have fixed a lot of the release issues, so I can now give this game my full approval.","May 3, 2014","true","55.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I loved Might & Magic v1 The Mandate of Heaven it was a real challenge to play, the battles were tough and  you always had great feeling when you fought the battle's and won .... Might & Magic X-Legacy is extreamly frustrating to get used with the controls at the begining but something clicks as you peservere and you get used to the controls and it becomes a really good challenging game, I love the modern graphics which really improve the experience of the game it brings Might & Magic to life ..... Such an improvement I'm really loving playing this game, Its downside is the slightly long loading screens but you can get used to this, and where is the don't touch the mercendise! gone, or when you leave the chapel Bless you!  Me I miss that from Might & Magic v1, but other than that its really only the awkward get used to the controls bit!.... I recomend this to anyone who played the early M&M games,  this has a great retro feel and  the modern graphics are absolutely brilliant......

After a quite nice start ( just a bit annoying expert/master/grandmaster-skillsystem ) the waiting on loads more and more angered me (takes 20s-1min per load).\n\nlater on you will find out that it really sucks to come to an area which might be relevant for quests without picking those quests before. On some game-important occasions like promotion missions you will end up with an open quest unable to complete it, if you've been to the quest-relevant area before. other bugs will add up, you will have problems to become grandmaster on some skills before it stops to matter if you are, and so on and on. Some things can be fixed when using boards to understand the game scripts, but honestly: this shouldnt be a player's deal at all.\n\nEspecially annoying are the relics. Of about 30 relics in the game about 2-5 might be of good use for your team, the rest is weaker than equipment that you can buy (granted you have the time to rest and reload often enough to reset shops), or you simply cannot use it with the party you chose.\n\non late stages (about level 25-30), depending on your chosen skills and equipment, you either wont have any mentionable enemies (i killed the last boss of the main quest with 3 hits once), or you'll have quite some problems to win it. For example: there is equipment adding +6 of a certain skill. depending on the skill you can achieve 25 (grandmaster) + 48 (2x6 foki, 3x6 jewelry, and 3x6 other equipment) for magic skills, which is damn much OP. you also could try to become invulnurable, wich is no hard task with some of the characters (about 100 defense, about 100 resistences).\n\nbut besides all that, at the end of the game you'll have to flee from a prison, having no equipment at start, being able to do lots of mistakes while fleeing. combined with the waiting time for reload, that was too much of frustration for me.\n\neven though i played that game quite some time, i cannot recommend it.\n\n","May 7, 2014","false","315.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Indeed, in many ways this is almost MMIV/V with 3D graphics, and more text.\n\nThat said, while MMX is definitely fun, it lacks the sense of humour and scale of its predecessors. MMIV/V had you exploring an entire planet, while Legacy keeps you on a single archapeligo. Despite the fact that there's still lots to explore, this does make everything feel oddly cramped. While the cities in X are about as far apart as those in IV and V, they feel much closer (and there's fewer of 'em). It's a minor issue, really, but it kinda sums up the game: The same as what came before, but somehow cramped.\n\nAs for the style: The old Might and Magic games didn't take themselves at all seriously. Well over 3/4 of the people you talk to were jokes. X is much more serious. It certainly has jokes, but there are fewer of them, replaced with lots of text. Usually I love lots of text in games, but here there are so many characters and factions to keep track of (and it definitely helps to have played Heroes VI by the same devs and set in the same world) that it becomes hard to really care about them, which is a shame, because the actual plot has loads of potential.\n\nAll-in-all, it's a buy if you like games such as Legend of Grimrock (though that's real time to MMX's turn based), Etrian Odyssey, or the old Might and Magic titles, then it's well worth a buy. If the idea of slowly working your way through a dungeon where one bad decision or unlucky chance can doom you, then this ain't for you.","January 27, 2014","true","39.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Be sure you know what you are buying even if it is only $25.\nThis is not just retro, it’s a trip back to the computer seventies. Movement is a square at a time. You are limited to the checkerboard regardless of what the picture looks like. Want your team to run off in a diagonal direction? Then get ready for a steady stream of left turn, forward, right turn, forward, left turn, forward, right turn, forward, etc.\nThe enviroment is simply a desktop background. You can interact with very little that you see. There are no in-game physics. I don’t find this an immersive game play experience.\nThere is some voice but mostly you will be reading lines. Team comments are limited, my team said “I think they smelled us, who hasn’t taken a bath?” at least 8 times in the 5 hours I've played. I’m not sure how much more of that I can take.\nOnce an enemy is in sight you are most likely to become “engaged in combat.”   When you are in combat you cannot move, except to spin in place; and you cannot run away, a tactic that would be handy to use when you bump into an enemy too far advanced to handle early in the game.\nNot a deal breaker but another irritating thing about the new release is that you can't position your characters where you want in a formation. You can move them in the lineup but there is no overhead view or choice of formation. As far as I can tell, they are standing in a line.\nI loved the M&M series and looked forward to playing this with friends but I soon realized this is not the way I remember M&M.  With games like Skyrim, FarCry 3, Dead Island Riptide, M&MX is just too ancient to enjoy. I would have much preferred to see an M & M updated to accommodate free movement, an interactive environment and game physics like Skyrim et al.

If the idea of slowly working your way through a dungeon where one bad decision or unlucky chance can doom you, then this ain't for you.","January 27, 2014","true","39.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Just don't expect a cutscene-heavy, "cinematic" RPG, MMX is pure gameplay with a very basic story, but a nice balance between open-world exploration and turn-based combat, tons of dungeons, creatures and powerful items to find.\n\nThis is one of those games that gets the character progression just right - you feel really helpless in the beginning, struggling to kill a bunch of wolves without someone dying, and the game stays difficult until the end (on warrior difficulty), but in the end, once your characters have earned their promotions and have got grandmaster ranks, they finally begin to feel powerful, annihilating hordes of monsters with a few spells, which feels really satisfying.\n\nOne thing that I didn't like about the combat mechanics was that once you enter melee range there is no way to move around, and no way whatsoever to escape from a bad encounter. Because there is a lot of exploration involved, and because even the starting area contains some creatures that are unbeatable until much later, this results in frequent save/load abuse. Scripted "trapped" chests or doors that cause enemies to spawn behind your back are also quite lame for the same reason, thankfully there are not too many of those.","February 8, 2014","true","52.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I love it to pieces, 24 hours in I am nowhere near final stages of the game it seems. If you liked Classic M&M - you will like this most likely. It does stray from some of the canons of 6-8, sometimes back to the roots, sometimes just keeping in tune with current-gen design practices. But the main - the feel of M&M is there, and it's gorgeous. I wouldn't try to compare it to Legend of Grimrock (though the comparisons really jumps to mind), because essentially the things that are great about this game are non-existent in LoG (Lore, colorful world, variety of characters, skills and systems) and vise a versa the things that made LoG great are a bit on the sidelines here (secrets are a plainer system, puzzles are not that convoluted, combat system not dynamic at all (it's actually Turn-based here), I would even say the graphics were a bit more spot on in LoG.\n\nNevertheless, If you have waited for this game: buy it now, you will not regret it.\nIf you haven't waited for this game: check out the videos to see if it's something that you might enjoy and probably give MM 6/8 a whirl first before picking this up, because that's an immortal cllassic.

You have exactly one direction you can go through the first town, you can't even leave town without finishing a railroad quest, unless I missed something.  And even after leaving your world is made up of "you can go to X different dungeons, but X-1 of them will kill you instantly" so you really just have the illusion of choice.  Maybe it opens up past the first region, but if you have to get that far in to a game for it to be open world, it isn't.\n\nThis railroading leads to the biggest issue I have compared to the old games, party composition.  I'm sure some dedicated players will be able to prove me wrong but I honestly don't feel like most party combinations will be viable in this game because of the mission you have to do before leaving town.  In the old games you could run a full ranged party and soften things up enough before they get to you if you were willing to accept that sometimes you don't soften them up enough and you get stomped.  This game doesn't seem to make that an option since there is no way to skip the first dungeon and it railroads you in to melees without the chance for an opening volley.  And that's not even considering the spells you have to run if you want to be able to explore everything.  Don't have a good coverage of the spell schools?  Prepare to miss a lot or use a guide.\n\nEven with these issues aside the mechanics just don't feel like they're there.  Outside of your weapons skills skill increases just don't seem to do much. For instance, armor skills reduce your penalty to wear armor, so if you've already negated the penalty it's just a waste of a point to put them there until you find the trainer or better armor. Unlike the old games you can't increase skills past a certain point without finding a trainer, so you end up maxing out your barbarian's mace and two-hander skills and then just throwing points into other things at random, or saving them until you can find the trainers, making your progression slam in to a wall.  Battles are just slug fests with both sides having what feels like high chances to block or dodge, which makes poison especially irritating since there's no, apparent, way to resist it and you can go three turns without anybody hitting someone if you're unlucky.  Any sort of incapacitation keeps that character from gaining XP, yes, even stun, so you find yourself stalling a battle so your tank will wake up and gain XP from the kill, only for the mage to get stunned and you to have to wait again.\n\nOverall there are just too many little issues that build up to make this game not fun, and there are too many games out there to waste time on one that's frustrating and not fun.  I feel bad for Limbic but hopefully this game got enough attention that Ubisoft will get someone that knows what they're doing, and has at least played a Might and Magic game before, for another attempt, because this could have been good.","January 30, 2014","false","14.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It can't hold a candle to might and magic 6 - 8, but its better than it could have been. Now on to the details...\n\nLikes: I like unique classes for each race.  In older might and magic games I often found my self falling into a pattern of bringin THE caster class, THE fighter, and so on. M&M 10 allows me to try different types of each character arctype and find a party style that works for me.  I like the characters and environment. The party characters FEEL like M&M party members have always felt, right down to the sarcastic comments and cheesy one-liners.  I love the sound sampling from older M&M games (the coin pickup and quest complete sounds come to mind).  The environments are fairly typical fantasy fare, but I enjoy fantasy games, so no problems there.\n\nDislikes: Slimmed down skill/class system.  There is no dissarm trap skill. No alchemy. None of the old support skills from older M&M games.  I feel that those kind of non-combat (or at least non-weapon/spell) skills were an important part of building a party of living characters.  You didn't just take a party of all Knights and Sorcerers because you needed someone to open the chests and sell the loot.  By taking away those support skills you limit the kind of play experience a player can have.   M&M 10 therefore leans more on its combat with minor exporation elements.\n\nFinal Verdict: 7 out of 10.

First off, don't think the screenshots on the store page are how it actually looks - I went in thinking it would be a gorgeous dungeon crawler and was severely let down. The game is actually quite hideous, and often looks about ten years too old. Inexplicably, it's also already a frontrunner for the worst optimized game of 2014. It doesn't matter how good your computer is - it will sound like it's about to blast off into space, and the game will chug and chop as you play. It's a shame too, because past all that the game offers quite an enjoyable old-school romp. Gone are the days of free roaming. This is a turn-based first-person RPG on a grid. The story is Fantasy 101, and hardcore fans of the Might and Magic series will probably get more out of it than everyone else. If you're like me, you'll skip the awful NPC dialogue and bash your head against your desk the 100th time your mercenary says, "Looks like they smelled us - who forgot to take a bath?" Still, there's some definite satisfaction out of exploring the map, finding legendary artifacts, and encountering enemies that will kill you in one hit (only to come back and faceroll them later on). The game will run around 40 - 60 hours if you want to do all the sidequests. Grab when it's $5 if you're looking for a blast of dungeon-crawling nostalgia - just don't expect it to be a polished or particularly original experience.","February 1, 2014","true","61.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'm a long time Might and Magic fan (yes, that includes the ones before VI!) and from a gameplay standpoint it most certainly delivers.  Here's a quick rundown of the good and bad.\n\nBAD\n-The game is saddled with the dreaded UPlay.  The servers are all over the place (not quite Origin levels) which can be a pain or can be painless depending on which way the wind blows.  That also means the game has some unlockables and achievements and the like, but all accessed through the UPlay client.\n-The game is buggy as hell.  After several months of 'early access' I expected it to be a little more polished.  It never reaches HOMM6 levels of ridiculousness, and I never had any game-breaking bugs, but there are a lot of graphical glitches and other interesting things that will be seen from even the most powerful machines.\n-There seems to be some content either missing and/or unfinished in the final product.  I won't spoil anything here but a look at the UPlay achievements indicates a lot of inaccessible material.\n-Enemies do not respawn and there is no 'respec' option, so it is not completely out of the realm of possibility to paint yourself into a corner.\n\nGOOD\n-Extremely solid and (mostly) fair turn-based combat.  There are a few too many battles that are initiated with enemies spawning on all sides of you, but once you learn to expect it you can get in to most fights fully buffed.\n-Varied party options and a great deal of spells and skills to take advantage of.  As with all RPGs some are *far* more useful than others but once you nail down a balanced team you can start blasting through monsters with gusto.\n-Fantastic voice acting and dialogue.  Story sequences are sparse but enjoyable.  The music is also great but sometimes will 'disappear' for long stretches (possibly a bug).\n-Lengthy quest and a lot of side material.  Doing all the available quests for a party of 4 different classes and exploring the entire world took around 40+ hours for me.\n-Several callbacks to earlier Might and Magic (as well as Heroes of Might and Magic) installments that will make you miss New World Computing.\n\nOverall I very much enjoyed my time with M&MX-Legacy.  Any fans of the early series (1-3 and especially Xeen) will find a lot to like here.  For the rest of you with a passing interest I would advise waiting until either some bug fixes hit or a steam sale to take the plunge.","February 2, 2014","true","43.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not the most well optimized game -- it doesn't look extremely good, but it will *bury* a GTX 580 -- when entering shops, my GPU fan shoots to 100% and the card temp goes to 90-95C.  Fairly widespread issue but no acknowledgement from the vendor on their forums.\n\nIn any case, the game is good -- the story is mindless and may as well be non-existant, unfortunately, but the gameplay is pretty much classic MM.  The smaller party size makes things slightly more strategic as your margin of error has decreased notably, which also helps to contribute to an overall greater difficulty level than the previous.\n\nI hope they fix the optimization problems, it's silly that a game that looks like this can load my GPU in ways that Crysis 3 and Far Cry 3 don't, but even if they don't, if you liked the grid / turn based Might and Magic games, this is an easy $25 to spend.","February 2, 2014","true","57.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

After the second city the game opens up leaving you to choose which side quest to tackle or which way to go.\n-Battles-\nLike previous MMs high level enemies may lurk just around a corner and slaughter you so you save/reload a lot while exploring. Even the "normal" fights are challenging so if you want to play a cakewalk game this is not for you.\nEvery battle turn you decide whether your PCs cast healing or an elemental shield or weaken the enemy armor, whether to attack or drink a potion. Also the tiles you stand on play a tactical role as you discover by dying to the second boss (yes you will die). Moving into a position where you get flanked can spell your doom and the harder battles have you flanked from all sides.\n-Other Gameplay-\nA lot of randomized loot to choose from. No hand-holding like respecing skills or warning if you enter a difficult area beside the "dangerous caves". No big spoilers on the automap or arrows pointing at your quest target.\nBunch of secret loot caches to find, hidden treasure rooms and powerful relics just like in the past.\nAlso riddle questions, switch, stepping and teleport puzzles and traps. Not always fun but mostly.\nAlong the way you find elemental shards to place on a corresponding altar to trigger a boss fight. This gives you a useful ability like forestwalk, waterwalk or enemy awareness.\n\nPC-wise there are 4 races each with 3 exclusive classes (might/magic/hybrid) = 12 classes and seven schools of magic. You only have 2 male and 2 female portraits per race which is rather lazy. You choose 4 dudes for your party. Depending on class you can either not learn a skill at all or expert/master/grandmaster it like the berserker can master "axe skill" and grand-master "spear skill" but can not learn "sword" or "dagger" or "heavy armor".\n\n-Legacy-\nMMX plays unlike the previous MMs, mostly feels like Wizardry8 meets Worlds of Xeen. It features a lot of easter eggs like a girl who wants to go to the circus like that Nicolai(?) from MM6 or a poem about the destroyer from MM9. Also characters reappear and the shrines to visit on a certain day. Sadly no insta-death fountains anymore.\nI feel it's a worthy entry to the M&M-franchise which appeared all but finished after the ill-received MM9 and frankly I'm glad they're back.\n\nI can recommend this game for fans of complex party-turn-based RPG-games as of old or any RPG-fan who likes a challenge as the game is really entertaining and there is a lot to do and to explore.","February 2, 2014","true","44.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

What this game lacks can be described in one word and that word is grandness. Start with music department. It is relatively weak and as I am writing this, I can't remember any of its melody. Whereas if I am asked to play music from M&M 6 on a piano now. I can do it in a heartbeat and it was more than 16 years ago since I first played M&M 6. Next thing is items. In Legacy, items are represented by small icons inside inventory window. How lame is that. A two-handed axe has the same dimension and takes up the same amount of spaces as an one-handed dagger. It just feels cheap and low quality. Another thing M&M 6 outshines Legacy is  critters. Where are titans, medusas and dragons? You even get to kill angels in previous games. In Legacy, minotaurs are pretty much the only epic monster left. And it is introduced early in the game (Act 2). By the time you reache the end, most of the monsters you are fighting are human like. If I want to kill human, I might as well be playing Battlefield 4.\nHowever, this game has shown some improvements. Improvements like spells. In Legacy, they have removed many useless spells. But dark school magic is still a waste of time once you reach expert level. Battles are not as grand but require more tactic. Map and towns are not huge, if you like sightseeing you may get disapointed. But the good part is that you don't waste too much time travelling around.\nOverall, this is a good game. If you are looking for an old school RPG. This is it. If you are a M&M fan looking for something that would blow every M&M game out of water. You may get disappointed. But Legacy is certainly worth a try.\n\n","March 4, 2014","true","75.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a trip back to when games were simple, but that doesn't mean they were easy.\n\nAlthough you can get a bit lost if you skip dialogs or don't read things throughly, the game do not urge you into action. You have all the time you want to do what you must do (if you stand still haha). You move over squares, take actions upon things in front of you, engage battles, have your way into dungeons.\n\nThe game has a good music and also a voice casting and environment sounds which does give life where you go, and also they points out some of the feelings in your crew (like when they get tired and hope for some rest).\n\nEnemies may be easy or tough depending on your approach or care. You might want to have some spells cast in prevention to any enemy engaging you at melee combat, which sadly don't allow your to run away, so you may run while you're engaging enemies in a ranged combat, however you may also get hit if they are in the same line as your are, and, sometimes, you may encounter tough enemies that you might not survive the tale. And that's something I enjoyed. I felt menace with the unknown, fearing a trap anytime soon that could end my history. That way, you don't play carelessly, but you are forced to be cautious and wary, force you to explore everywhere you can reach, before going to more dangerous areas.\n\nI used to play MM VII, which has a very different gameplay, however I liked X also. They are different, but enjoyable all the same. I must say that killing a red dragon at the first map area, in VII, was very entertaining. I still cannot see a way to beat a too strong foe in X with a novice team, given that you are bound to turn-based events. In VII, you could only beat that red dragon in Emeral Island not by using turn-based battle, because then, you could run and dodge his attacks freely, rather than hoping it would miss, which he rarely did.\n\nPeople might not like much a turn-based first person rpg, but I say you can try it. You'll have your time to adjust yourself to the task, and some rewards are very interesting, you start really enjoying the whole thing and you want to get to the bottom of the problems. Ah, remember to save your potions, right?\n\nI'm still far from the ending, I believe, but I'm not in a rush.

I submitted a helpdesk ticket to ubisoft (I'm on mac, but they apparently don't admit to have a mac version, so I submitted it to the windows help desk) and got a useless response. They basically had me install every OS X update and some flash installers, none of which really helped. I felt like I had just called comcast and the script the "helpful" individual on the other end had them read the same thing, even if it was totally innappropriate.\n\nHowever, I changed my recommendation after following the directions in one of the steam forums. Apparently, this is a 32 bit game and, for mac users, you must find the actual program and mark it as such in order to get decent playability. Once you do, it is fine (though, not a stellar experience). I'm pretty sure Macs have been 64 bit for over 10 years now. But, maybe the code they are using is still 32 bit and they can't afford to have someone actually update it? Even the PC version isn't 10 years old...\n\nThe game plays more or less like the old M&M games that came before it, but with better graphics. Having grown up with games like this, I prefer the turn based combat. There are some real problems, such as situations where the enemy you are fighting doesn't actually appear on your screen. However, you can still blow them away with fireballs, even if you have no clue where they are. I've seen pirates walk through walls to fight you, and combat turns for the opponent can take several minutes as the animations dig through to find you.\n\nAll in all, this is a decent remake of those old school dungeon grinders that were king back in the 90s but modernized for semi modern hardware. If they put some work tuning the engine itself, it would probably be a great iPad or android game. Hopefully, it will get some attention and they'll fix some of the more annoying bugs (and maybe bring it into the 21rst centry of 64 bit hardware?). But, even now, it's a fun game that can be enjoyed for hours.","April 18, 2014","true","56.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","3"

I killed the final boss with a lucky hit just before the final doo-dad quest was completed so I hope that didn't make amazing changes.

Replayability is adequate since you can only do four classes at a time.   But the game does not change much other than that.

It's a trip back to when games were simple, but that doesn't mean they were easy.\n\nAlthough you can get a bit lost if you skip dialogs or don't read things throughly, the game do not urge you into action. You have all the time you want to do what you must do (if you stand still haha). You move over squares, take actions upon things in front of you, engage battles, have your way into dungeons.\n\nThe game has a good music and also a voice casting and environment sounds which does give life where you go, and also they points out some of the feelings in your crew (like when they get tired and hope for some rest).\n\nEnemies may be easy or tough depending on your approach or care. You might want to have some spells cast in prevention to any enemy engaging you at melee combat, which sadly don't allow your to run away, so you may run while you're engaging enemies in a ranged combat, however you may also get hit if they are in the same line as your are, and, sometimes, you may encounter tough enemies that you might not survive the tale. And that's something I enjoyed. I felt menace with the unknown, fearing a trap anytime soon that could end my history. That way, you don't play carelessly, but you are forced to be cautious and wary, force you to explore everywhere you can reach, before going to more dangerous areas.\n\nI used to play MM VII, which has a very different gameplay, however I liked X also. They are different, but enjoyable all the same. I must say that killing a red dragon at the first map area, in VII, was very entertaining. I still cannot see a way to beat a too strong foe in X with a novice team, given that you are bound to turn-based events. In VII, you could only beat that red dragon in Emeral Island not by using turn-based battle, because then, you could run and dodge his attacks freely, rather than hoping it would miss, which he rarely did.\n\nPeople might not like much a turn-based first person rpg, but I say you can try it. You'll have your time to adjust yourself to the task, and some rewards are very interesting, you start really enjoying the whole thing and you want to get to the bottom of the problems. Ah, remember to save your potions, right?\n\nI'm still far from the ending, I believe, but I'm not in a rush. I want to experience it slowly and steady.","April 9, 2014","true","75.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While a person has a choice, the static encounters (no respawn) do largely require certain levels/gear. The 'choice' to go where a person wants to go is false and numerous notes must be made to navigate where to go at later points. The game also doesn't display encounter level, making notes taken just reflect 'too hard at level 7' and the such. Being an older gamer I thought I'd enjoy the challenge of a turn-based RPG, but the game is much weaker than Might and Magic games released 10+ years ago. As an added negative, the game should run/load incredibly fast as it does not have fluid movement from AI programmed nasties like a majority of games nowadays; yet the programmers failed miserably and the game loads/lags well beyond what it should (a rough guess would be it runs at 5% of what it should comparing it to other graphically intense newly released games played on the same system with similiar settings.

Not having played original M&M games I'd hoped there would be lots of lore to pick from and create a huge, immersive and rich environment. Sadly, the lore and opportunity may have been there, but the implementation went someplace else.\n\nScale-wise it certainly is no Skyrim - a dozen of locations or so. To call it an "open world" is almost laughable with all the progression-based obstacles you coincidentally encounter at every turn - ranging from guards blocking a bridge and impassable terrain to hopeless fights. Talking about rich environment - there's not much role playing, aside from listening to gossips from NPCs with sporadic voice-overs, sifting through loot to find something that suits your party and wondering about the way you were supposed to distribute your skill points to not get brutalized all over the map after act one.\n\nIn short: the dungeons are there, the quests are there, the loot is there, but it still feels like a farm sim - and not the best one.\n","January 29, 2014","false","71.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As a MM fan having played all MM games, this game actually succeeds in capturing the MM charme and spirit! It is nice to level up, train with trainers, and get to Expert, Master and GM status. The game is well balanced, quite difficult at the beginning, so that you will need to come back later for some bosses, and even in late game, remains challenging. The size of the game is nice, also that there are some riddles and puzzles in the dungeons.\nNegative: Graphics outdated, bad decisions in the beginning (many experts, Masters are not accessible until later acts, as they are located in cities you cant access!), a lot of walking around due to lack of decent teleport system; weak presentation of the "story". Last, UPLAY does not work properly if game is bought through Steam... you need to contact Support to be able to get UPlay points and unlock Rewards (worked with al other UPlay gmaes I have).\n\nAll in all, a nice and addicting RPG similar to older MM titles, which could have been grand with a higher budget and a better engine, but delivers on what it tries to be. Too bad it was no success, and likely there will be no future games like this.","January 31, 2015","true","70.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198000698735/recommended/238750/","76561198000698735","Last Knight Down","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198000698735/","337 products in account","I'm not entirely sure this is a fitting homage to the series, let alone a worthy sequel to the original Might and Magic first person adventure games. This feels more like a Wizardry game than anything, only it does not have random encounters.\n\nIf you're looking for an updated version of M&M 6: The Mandate of Heaven, you're going to notice immediately that combat is turn based instead of action based and that you're not able to cheese the ranged attacks quite the same way you did in the last few titles. This forces the element of difficulty into the game that used to come from having to strategize about when and where to cast spells and run from enemies. Once engaged in melee combat, you can't back away or use exits, and very often you're arbitrarily ambushed and beaten down from behind. This leaves little to no strategy available to the player to decide when and where to engage the enemy. Worse still, every skill you need to progress is gated by leveling up multiple times and collecting money, which there is a limited amount of in the game.\n\nThis entire game feels like it was designed by people who did not play the original series and do not fully understand the mystique and challenge of M&M adventure games. The elements are there but different. Most of the difficulty in this game comes from needing to block or chug potions at the right time. And you can't even equip the best shields available to you in the first town. You have to complete several incredibly difficult dungeons and make it to the second town before you're even allowed to purchase the training to equip them. This makes the fights with tougher enemies frustrating if not outright unfair. Those who would focus on defense to secure the best outcome are punished while people who choose whatever deals the most damage are rewarded; All in all, this is par for the course for turn based games but not balanced the way M&M 1-6 were. Moreover, entire methods of playing the game, such as going with heavy armor and shields, goes completely unrewarded, so there's no point to that portion of the content. You do not have a front-line and a back-line since enemies can reach any of your party members to attack them at any time, so there isn't even signficant incentive to have defensive members balancing against softer damage dealers until halfway into the game when you actually get usable healing spells. By then, you'd have been better off going full barbarian or mage across the board.\n\nThe only genuinely positive part of this experience is that the dungeons and quests all string together nicely like an mmo and it's easy to figure out where to go next just from exploring and poking around on the mini map, talking to people, etc. That and, somehow acknolwedging the limitations of non-respawning chests and enemies, the game apparently dumps loot on you when you find it, so that's nice.\n\nI haven't played a full team of mages like I mentioned earlier yet but I suspect they work much better than the classes I was trying before; And if that is the case, then this is the only great similarity between the original games and this one. Overall, I don't want to take the time to play it anymore after having gotten my butt kicked repeatedly. I'm already too frustrated after a few hours of trudging around in the Lighthouse. The difficulty curve is ridiculous and fights go from being winnable to being totally hopeless, from room to room even. Moreover, there's almost nothing to indicate to you when going in a room or across a bridge will be life threatening so you can never learn from your mistakes. There are even several places you're clearly meant to return to when you're stronger, but how much stronger is somewhere between vaguely incomprehensible and utterly unfathomable. It feels like a big slap in the face when you as a player go in a door that was open to you and can't even escape certain demise because you weren't genuinely going to be allowed an opportunity to succeed at what lay behind it. This kind of high stakes trial-and-error is very unrewarding and disappointing.\n\nUpdate: I have now played with a full team of mages and it's as I suspected. I was able to get this team to the place of progress it had taken hours to get to before within about 30 minutes. Of course once you run into the one thing that's immune to the school of magic you've been focusing on or up the difficulty from normal to hard, you can expect to be back in the boat of unplayable content and frustration. Overall, the game seems to want to force you to have to bring a specific party to accomplish the goals it sets before you. Some doors can't even be found and some passage ways can't even be opened unless a person with a high score in a specific stat is able to locate and/or open them for your team, which means teams lacking that stat may not even be able to progress in certain dungeons at all. This is very detrimental as, 1) it's impossible to know what the recommended (or required) team composition is upfront and 2) playing with any other party composition is apparently almost futile.\n\nTLDR; This is a competent and somewhat fun to play turn-based RPG but has little to nothing to offer those who are fans of M&M6. I'd still like to recommend this one because it's challenging and a classic first person dungeon crawler like Wizardry, but I can't while it's at any price over 10 dollars. The fact that Wizardry 6 is the same kind of game and was slightly better than this despite having come out 24 years ago prevents me from doing so. If you were hoping to have some fun with this one, buy Wizardry Renaissance and play it all the way through first. Then maybe pick this one up and play it out of boredom when it falls below 10 dollars standard price.","December 23, 2014","false","10.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It somehow made me feel like playing Dioblo II. However, its turn-based strategy and gameplay(battle for the most) and the way player explore the map are very interesting. I admit the graphics are bad for a game made in 2013, but the gameplay experience overwhelmed the graphics problem anyway.","February 27","true","46.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

After playing this I just HAD to play the rest of the M&M series, and I played from 3 to 9 and loved every second of it. This is how RPGs are supposed to be!\n\nPros:\n- awesomely fun RPG game in pretty much every way.\n\nCons:\n- support was unfortunately pulled by Ubisoft before a host of audio problems could be patched out, so we're stuck with them forever now. Battle music gets stuck on all the time, sounds constantly don't play or have wrong volumes. With a long enough play session you can end up with 3+ battle songs all playing at the same time all out of synch, which is pretty irritating to hear. these problems are extremely disappointing since the game itself is otherwise so amazing. exiting and running the game again does fix it though (temporarily).\n\n- After having played the rest of the series, there are a few things in comparison that I miss, but these are not strictly good or bad:\n\n- most M&M games have an accelerating levelling scale. progression is slow in the beginning, but by the end you're gaining like 10 levels per trainer visit. in this one, progression does start slow, and does accelerate at first, but at the end it slows to a crawl, and you end up basically frozen and will never be good at everything you could have been good at. this is pretty strongly different than the other M&Ms where you could master everything about your class and still have tons of points left over. depending on your point of view this could be a good or bad thing.\n\n- this game actually has *better* tactical combat than any of the other M&M games, and depending on which classes you choose, you can still become very powerful. though the classes are actually very imbalanced as well, some being extremely powerful and some being very weak. again, this may or may not be a bad thing.","January 2","true","111.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you like the old might & magic games, you'll love this one. It is buggy and I couldn't play it with the highest graphics because some effects will crash the game. I set all to medium or low and I enjoyed the game nontheless.\n\nSome cool riddles, cool but simple puzzles. great intense battles, cool unique items that level up. Really loved this game.\n\nI think that, if they step away from Unity and get an engine that doesn't make your life a living hell, and do more of  the cool things they made for this game, M&M XI should be a return to the old days when M&M was the best turn-based rpg out there.\n\nWould recommend? To a M&M fan sure, buy it now! To a regular rpg gamer, I'd say buy it on sale or look for something else.","October 8, 2015","true","84.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But dammit I'm alright with that. This is a good game. Good graphics, good maps, good environments, good voice acting, it's just good.\n\nIs it great per se? No, not really, but it's still a good game. For 30 dollars you could do way worse, but maybe just slightly better.\n\nI had fun with this game, and my tech problems from before were from unrelated reasons from this game, it was just a coincidence... I hope.","May 14, 2014","true","15.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"
