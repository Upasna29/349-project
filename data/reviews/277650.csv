I would go so far as to say that it is one of the games that made me fall in love with the RPG genre as a whole.\n\nAbout the Game In Kult, you are born into a land who's diety was killed by a man wielding the Godslayer sword in centuries past, and subsequently has unleashed an Inquisition to wipe out the last remnants of any and all religions of the land. You play as a young woman named Alita, a young inquisitor (No, you AREN'T the inquisitor from Dragon Age), and a woman marked with great power. The inquisition has sent you to find an ancient relic that they consider to be a threat to their cause, and are drawn into a war between mages seeking great power and a religious cult trying to ressurect their dead god. There are six different endings to the game, all based on the actions and choices you make throughout the game.\n\nPros - Character customization, that while is limited, offers the player some freedom of how they envision Alita.\n- Flexible combat system which allows you to switch from melee, to ranged, to magic.\n- Attunement system is a nice concept. The more you use a weapon, the better it gets.\n- Real and Dreamworld states, in which your character can "step" between for a time. This is useful for evading enemies that are in the real world, or evading enemies that are in the dream state. There are also entities which can switch between both worldstates like you, which adds variety to the game.\n- Decent storyline, that while isn't strong or well written in some areas, offers a lot for immersion and roleplay factors.\n- An interesting take on an inquisition. Normally inquisitions are created to rid lands of "heathen" religions, not to cleanse the lands of religions entirely.\n\nCons - Low resolution on the screen. However, the game is still playable.\n- Hit detection can be sluggish at times\n- Outdated graphics which look even more outdated due to the low resolution of the screen.\n- Combat system, while flexible, requires little thought in the ways of strategy and tactics. In a game where combat is a key role for your inquisitor, one would think that the combat system would have been ahead of its time.\n\n\nThis game to me, is pure nostalgia, and playing through it again has made me realize what an underrated gem it is today. While some would call it a Diablo clone, I would strongly argue against it. The game has interesting mechanics, gives you a feel of choice and consequences, and offers many witty lines throughout the story. I would actually consider Kult: Heretic Kingdoms more of an unpolished cousin to the Baldurs Gate games which were shining strong around the same time this game came out.. and without the hamsters.\n\nDo not be afraid to try this game. The story holds up well and will let you relive the age of games where strong storylines beat top notch graphics.","October 1, 2015","true","6.0"," 22 of 27 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","22","27","0","7"

It's an ARPG that reminds me superficially of Divine Divinity. I must admit it didn't immediately grab me, the first ten minutes are not exactly awe-inspiring, and the difficulty of getting to grips with the combat and the Dreamworld make it easy to bounce off it. But I tried again the next day and I was hooked.\n\nThe Dreamworld mechanic is interesting, slip freely between one reality and the next, but I felt more could have been done with the concept (I think the sequel to this game addresses that), but it still made for an interesting take on combat. I played a mage, which I reckon is more interesting than a pure melee character; melee combat isn't particularly satisfying, but throwing around fireballs and ice storms? Yes please! Having to unlock different attunements that provide a number of useful "spells" (and having to decide which ones to use out of your limited slots) is the most interesting aspect of the combat system, and towards the end of the game you become satisfyingly very powerful. There are certainly flaws to the game, pathfinding can be annoying at times, combat (as a fluffy mage) can turn into a chase around the nearest rock, and you can tell it's a product of its time.\n\nWhat kept me going was the exploration (the different locations have that addictive "what's around the next corner / what loot is in that chest?" allure), the storyline (delivered with aplomb by Tom Baker, who could make the phone book interesting frankly) and the enjoyable combat. Overall one of those games that turns out to be a pleasant surprise. I think it took me about 25 hours to finish (I mostly played offline, so the Steam time is inaccurate).","February 25","true","3.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The story is pretty good and not as trite as many other fantasy rpgs.\n\nThe graphics do look very dated now, so I won't be playing it again (got it for free with the new Heretic KIngdoms game), but if you have never played it, it's worth a look.","September 8, 2015","true","0.2"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

The background/world has a permanently blurred appearance.  The controls are crude and don't follow the usual convetions for games of this type.  I readily admit I didn't get very far or give it much of a chance beyond the first 5 minutes.  There was simply nothing about it which compelled me to go any further.","October 20, 2015","false","1.1"," 1 of 11 people (9%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","9","1","11","0","1"
