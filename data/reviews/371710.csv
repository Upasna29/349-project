(Just get to level 100)\nYou have no need to use Builders. (The game will build your castle just fine from random events and leveling)\nYou have no need to use soldiers, you have no need to ever fight, just run its better for you, even if you win.\nYou level by gaining population so that is really all you need to do, fighting loses you population so it’s a bad idea.\nNo level of difficulty it’s all just super easy.\n\nComments:\nWhen I got to level 38 I was able to jump to 51 the next turn, then to 89 then 100, game over I win (no need to concur any other provinces). This game is in need of play testing and re-balancing.","May 16, 2015","false","3.2"," 46 of 51 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","46","51","2","0"

Only reason why I got this game is I wanted to get one of the most craziest and dumb game possible for my 69th game. The trailer was pretty crazy and the game was pretty dumb lol.\n\nI really wanted to give this game a thumbs up but as it is right now I just can't nor can I recommend this for anyone to get.","July 31, 2015","false","3.0"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","11","16","0","0"

It is cleanly done but it is one of the least interesting game on offer for PC.\n\nGaemplay:\n- adjust slider between Ressources, Builders, Warriors and Population increase (no reason to change every turn)\n- press enter\n\noccassionaly you get a battle either click autofight or retreat, based on the prediction.\nonce in a while you get enough gold to purchase an upgrade, but gold come very slowly.\n\nThat's all,\n","February 13","false","1.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

No real strategy required, brute forcing the game by spamming days is even enough to win.\n\nI still get some mild enjoyment and satisfaction out of the game but it is quite hollow due to the little effort and how short the game is.\n\nGame takes no more than an hour to complete so definately a long way from the £3.99 price tag, may recommend if it were -90%","September 17, 2015","false","4.3"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"
