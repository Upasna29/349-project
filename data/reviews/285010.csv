If you like doing puzzle games and are also a fan of zombies,  I would recommend this game. The puzzles get progressivly challenging- with the hardest having 350 pieces. The pieces float around in a river which makes for a little challenge of grabbing the ones you need. I got a little frustrated clicking over and over and picking up the piece that was either overlapping or under the piece I wanted. Many pieces got away from me, but I eventually caught them. The puzzles are nicely drawn and one thing I really liked was that each puzzle had different shaped pieces. One had different suits as on each side- spades, hearts, clubs, and diamonds. Another puzzle with a rapper zombie had words like SWAG as the edges of the pieces which made it interesting.\n\nThe zombie shooter aspect of the game is fun, but I didn't find it as challenging as I expected it to be. The zombies come out one by one until the Z timer runs out. Then multiple zombies run out, but at a rather slower than desired pace. I was able to pick most of them off before they even reached my barricade. Most run in a straight line or at a slight slope.\n\nIt would be nice to be able to change the difficulty level to up the zombie factor, either with more zombies, special zombies (currently, all zombies take 3 shots to kill), or zombies that run in zigzagging directions making them harder targets. I know the game is fairly new, so I'm looking forward to seeing what will be added to it. I'd also be interested in purchasing DLC puzzles. Lastly, Steam achievements would be the icing on the cake for this game.","June 11, 2014","true","8.9"," 27 of 30 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","27","30","0","0"

It's basically what you see- you're completing a jigsaw, but to change things up a bit you also occasionally get attacked by zombies at the bottom right, so you have to think about your ammo and barricades etc. So that you don't die. It's fairly challenging, actually.\n\nThe puzzles are nice and it doesn't have the problem of everything being a similar colour in the jigsaw, the art is pretty good, and it makes a nice change in the pace of the game when you suddenly get attacked by a horde of zombies.\n\nThere's also an option when you start each jigsaw to turn off the zombies, in case you really don't want them.\n\nAlso, the jigsaw pieces are shaped differently to the usual looking jigsaw pieces, which is an interesting idea and you have to think differently to how the pieces go together.\n\nIt's an interesting idea, and I feel it works well.\n\nThere also seem to be enough jigsaw puzzles to keep you busy and justify the price, and the devs are adding more for free.\nReccomended :D","June 11, 2014","true","33.5"," 23 of 26 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","23","26","0","0"

It is also somewhat easier than the Japan version due to using drawings instead of photographs.\n\nThere's a tacked on "survival mode" with a shooting game going on in the lower part of the screen, as a kind of hard mode. A nice idea, but mediocre in execution.\n\nImages vary from good with funny motifs to half amateurish, which is a shame. There's fifteen puzzles in total, if they had gone with their better illustrator for all of them it would have uplifted the whole game.\n\nWhat finally prompted me to go for a negative rating (instead of saying it's mediocre and still giving it a thumbs up) has to be that one last achievement though. Completionists, stay away from this unless you are prepared to suffer!\nThere's a menu mini game, which has several achievements tied to it. Some of them are for killing a certain amount of menu zombies. The first ones stack, the last one apparently doesn't. So essentially I'd have to start all over again for that last one, because I was tricked into believing I could give my eyes a rest after over an hour of the most boring(!) achievement hunt period.\nDoing hard achievements is one thing (and welcome), but this was simply a sadistic and dirty move from the devs on behalf of hunters. So, to return that "favor": here you go, Decaying Logic, while being overall not very much disappointed by the game, I choose to make that one, tiny last bit under my review a big thumbs down.

I'm not too familiar with the genre so I don't know where this title stands in the great pantheon, but it's a solid way to kill a few hours.\n\nThis game is basically divided into three modes. There's the jigsaw puzzles, there's survival jigsaw, and menu zombies. Survival Jigsaw adds an element of danger. While you're trying to put together the puzzle, you also have to fight off the occasional zombie. There's a clock and when time is up a minor horde will attack. You earn cash via completing pieces of the puzzle, which can be spent on defenses, or to view the full picture. You also control some guy who can shoot or throw grenades at the zombies. It's a cute idea I suppose, but I'd rather focus on the puzzle itself.\n\nMenu Zombies is an overhead shooter, that takes place on the main menu. It's basically a gimmick-mode, since you can best it simply by standing still and throwing infinite grenades at everything. There are achievements for killing 5,000 menu-zombies and staying alive for an hour. I spent 15 minutes in this mode, which is still far far far too much time.\n\nLike I said, I don't own any other videogame puzzle...games(?) so I can't judge the overall quality of this title compared to others. I do however love me some jigsaw puzzles, and the convenience of not cluttering up a coffee or dining room table is a nice bonus.\n\nFor a "throwaway" indie bundle title, this ain't bad.","October 29, 2014","true","4.2"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","16","17","0","1"

This is a really clever concept, tying an action defense game in to a jigsaw puzzle mechanic, and I REALLY admire the concept - but its in total contrast to the other game in terms of tension, panic and ultimately frustration. I'll still play it, because of the novelty of it, and sometimes I like a buzz.\n\nIf you like being under pressure, and you have a quick keen eye for puzzle pieces you might like this incarnation. If you're a dawdler and a person who does jigsaws for relaxation I'd say this probably isnt the right title - go and play the Pixel Puzzles Japan game instead.","June 19, 2014","true","0.7"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","16","18","0","0"

A military truck carrying numerous chemical agents speeds down main street.  The truck hits the pot hole Ms. McGreagor has been trying to get fixed for the last five years.  The truck's front right tire crashes into the pot hole then back up.  Causing the containers of waste to smash against each other.  Using quick thinking the driver of the truck manages to maintain control.. He mutters profanities to himself as he continues his trip into forest Cliche.  As he steers the truck over the unpaved roadways the veteran driver picks up a pack of the cheap cigarettes, the kind a man smokes when he dares cancer to infect his lungs.  Shaking the pack gently he flicks his wrist and a single cigarette appears.  putting the pack to his mouth he wraps his lips around the smoke.\n\nThe man tosses the pack of cigarettes on the seat next to him and pop's out the truck's lighter.  Reaching down he yanks out the lighter and proceeds to light his smoke.  He takes notice of a large puddle ahead of him.  He speeds up like any driver does when they see a large puddle.  What he didn't realize was the puddle has loosened the dirt and as the three thousand pound truck cruises into the water, the dirt lets loose causing the truck to fall down the side of a rather steep hill.  The hill isn't really much of an issue, but the town's drinking water down below is.  The truck flips and the barrels of various chemicals crack open and pour directly into the drinking water.\n\nI think we all know what's about to happen.. that's right ZOMBIES...\n\nPixel Puzzles Undeadz is a very niche title, it'll appeal to people who like puzzles, well extreme puzzles..  The game has a total of 13 puzzles, each of them being a rather ghoulish looking photo, with some type of undead or zombie.  In all honesty I wouldn't mind having a few of them as my screen savers or back ground pictures..\n\nThe pro's  -\n\nNice challenge to putting together puzzles, the pieces float around, and it can make finding and grabbing pieces rather difficult.  Combined together with a ticker which counts down untill a stream of zombies charge out and you'll be forced to switch your attention to killing them with your soldier..\n\nInteresting art work,\n\nA main menu minigame.\n\nEasy but grindy achievements\n\nThe con's\n\nThe pool pieces have a knack for picking up the wrong piece. (You'll always pick up the next left most piece in the puzzle.)  Which makes getting your corners together quite bothersome, even grabbing a single piece can be troublesome especially on the puzzles with the smaller pieces..\n\nThe main menu minigame is repetitive and necessary if you want to complete the achievements (will take at bare minimum an hour and a half to get just the 6 associated with the main menus game)\n\nI wouldn't recommend this title to everyone, while I had a lot of fun with it, I can imagine other people may not find the fun in putting together puzzles, even the added benefit of the zombies crashing through the barricade and eating your soldier may not be enough excitement for some.  I'd suggest watching some videos and doing some research before you actually plunker down your money.  This way you'll be fully informed on whether or not you want to make the purchase or not.","February 26","true","16.7"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","13","13","3","0"

The result is a mixture of half-baked ideas that could have been so much better.\n\nMixing an action minigame with the patience-driven puzzle game just doesn't work. It doesn't help that the Tower Defense-esque portion is mediocre at best. You have a single straight lane were a few Zombies at a time come out and you can either place barricades to slow them down, mines to kill them or shoot/throw grenades to kill them. One problem here is, that you get the money to buy this stuff not from killed zombies but at random for correctly places puzzle pieces another, that as soon as a timer runs out, more and more Zombies come down the lane and you don't have much time to concentrate on the actual puzzle anymore.\nOn the bright side, you don't have to play in this mode and can enjoy the puzzles taking all the time you want.\nThat would be nice, if the actual puzzle game would be good.\n\nFirst the mechanics are totally off - it only checks the position of the tile against its right spot on the canvas and there's no possibility to connect tiles and move them around. Either you find the right spot and it gets locked or not. That's acceptable for minigames in larger games, but not for a standalone jigsaw game.\nFinding the right tiles is made ridiculously hard with all of them floating and moving around the edge all overlapping each other and not respecting screen borders. The tiles are a fraction of their actual size and the elaborated shapes are barely visible. If you finally spot a piece you want, the game does its very best to make it as hard as humanly possible for you to actually grab it. Even if the cursor is right over it and it's not overlapped itself or overlapping you will most likely grab another, presumably warped in from the other side of the screen.\nApart from that the actual puzzles are too easy. The last one only has 350 pieces, the tiles can't be rotated and like mentioned before will just snap on get locked if they're in the right spot.\n\nIf you're on the brink of frustation due to chasing a tile for literally a minute, you will start to notice something else. The badly looped, too short single piece of background music, the clunky controls of the action mini game and the uninspired pictures themselves.\n\nAnd then there is a third game within the game. The main menu is kind of a twin stick shooter zombies ... for whatever reason. But this comes with its own problems, like imbalances, weird hitboxes and a delay between triggering an action and the actual action, leading to you firing shots in whatever direction you're facing while it's performed and not the one where it it's supposed to go.\nOddly enough the developer honours that gimmick with a good portion of the achievements, one for surving 60min and one for killing 5000 zombies - in one life, in one sitting, without pause - which takes around 100min. The actual distinguishing feature of the game - the tower defense - meanwhile only gets a total of 3 achievements, one of them for failing. The elephant in the room: is this reflectory of their priorities for this game?\n\nAnywho, if you enjoy jigsaw puzzles it might still be worth it for you. I spent around 6h on the 20 puzzles and did get some enjoyment out of it.","January 2, 2015","false","9.2"," 17 of 22 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","17","22","0","2"

What if I said you don't need to choose? It's either incredibly stupid, or incredibly clever. Either way, it's incredible!\n\nWhat's it all about? It's basically jigsaw puzzles with an undead theme to the pictures you have to assemble. To make things more interesting, it's also a zombie survival game. I can see the eyes popping out of your head in disbelief. It actually works surprisingly well. While you try to put together your jigsaw puzzle, you also have to keep an eye on the path at the bottom of the screen, ensuring the little man down there survives the zombie attacks. If he dies you have to restart the puzzle. He's only armed with a few bullets and grenades, but if you can assemble some pieces you'll be able to buy some more ammo soon enough.\n\nFreaky, huh?\n\nIf that wasn't enough to lift your eyebrows clear off your face, there's a 'horde' timer as well. If you're fast enough with earlier puzzles you can avoid these, but later, bigger puzzles will see you defending against numerous zombie hordes. They can be easy, but distracting; yet it helps mix up the gameplay elements and stops you from falling asleep. Often you can get by letting the horde build up at a barricade, then set a tripwire bomb on all of them at once. Some might prefer the simple pleasure of a jigsaw puzzle without the additional complications - if this is you, you might want to steer clear of this game.\n\nThe puzzles themselves are a mixed bag. Some are easy, others are made needlessly hard by having too much of the image one colour or texture. They're passable, but none of the images really jumps out at me as a favourite. The accompanying background music wasn't bad though, it has a good survival feel to it.\n\nSpeaking of survival, it even has a minigame on the menu screen, where you must survive from a top-down perspective on a small patch of earth against zombies that continue to appear and attack from all sides. This game caps out at about 65 'menu zoms' on the screen at a time though, so it's kind of fun.\n\nNothing like the threat of a zombie horde to make you jigsaw hard and fast!

The theme for this one being a zombie apocalypse.\nThey managed to incorporate the theme into the jigsaws by creating a tower-defense mini-game of sorts at the bottom of the puzzle. The aim is that you have to complete the jigsaw, but also keep your little character alive. You buy ammo and defenses with money you accumulate by placing pieces of the puzzle in the right places. If you fail to keep your character alive, you lose.\n\nThis makes for an interesting twist on an otherwise quite relaxing genre of game. You need to manage your resources properly and make sure you are solving the puzzle fast enough for you to keep a steady amount of money in the bank for defenses. That added pressure can actually make the game more intense. Especially when you start getting to the later puzzles.\n\nThere are 19 puzzles in total, ranging from 5 different levels of difficulty. Anyone who has played any of the others in the series will already know what the structure is like. The more difficult the level of puzzle is, the less of them there are in that level. For example, You will start with 6 easier puzzles to complete, then 5 slightly harder ones, then 4 harder ones again, then 3 then a big final one to complete.\n\nI quite enjoyed the uniqueness to this one, as from what i can see, the others in the series are pretty standard. With that said, this whole theme may be a little tedious for those who just want to relax and solve the puzzle in their own time.\n\nThe art in this game is interesting, and a few of them actually made me think. There are certain scenarios that aren't really highlighted in zombie apocalypse stories and some of the art pieces in this, while a tad questionable, actually made me wonder (or just straight up say "oh, that's messed up").\n\nIn terms of achievements, this one has a few that are quite tedious. Along with the puzzles, there is a main menu mini-game that involves you playing as your little character. Zombies home in from all angles and your aim is to just survive as long as you can.\nThe tediousness in the completion of this game lays here. You have to 1) survive 60 minutes in that main menu mini-game and 2) kill an overall of 5,000 zombies in the main menu mini-game. Which, alas. Is mind numbing.\nI would go into details for tips and tricks for these achievements, but honestly, as there is not many guides on this game i am actually  tempted to just create one. So check for a guide if you need help, if not feel free to ask.\n\nAll in all it was fun! It stressed me out a little and i would be lying if i said i wasn't looking forward to starting another one in the series that is less stressful.\nBut still, it was an interesting one in the series and i would recommend it to anyone that wants a classic jigsaw game with a bit of a twist.\n\nTL;DR : A fun jigsaw puzzle game with a bit of a twist, definitely too try if you want something a little more unique that will put a bit of pressure on. But if you'd prefer to relax and solve the puzzles in your own time, maybe try another in the same series.","January 17","true","9.8"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

And I just can't recommend it.\n\nFirst the good things: I like the graphic style. The pictures used for the jigsaw puzzles were nice and had enough characteristics to solve within 15-60 minutes each. The game includes 19 of those puzzles with 60-350 pieces.\n\nBut... there are a couple of things I just didn't like and which made me not to recommend the game.\nThere is the same big bug in the game as it is in Pixel Puzzles: Japan. You just can't select a floating piece properly. Whenever there is more than one piece below your cursor, the one with the lowest internal id is selected (i guess) and this is not the puzzle piece that is the most on top, but is visually the piece down below.\nAll the piece ids are sorted from top left to bottom right. So picking the upper row is ok, but when you want to complete the border first, you have to be very patient until you have all the pieces on the board.\n\nSecond thing I didn't like is the minigame. In Zombiemode you have to defeat zombies while you solve the puzzles. Let's be honest, most people solve jigsaws because they want a calm experience, not a time challenge?\nOk, you can deactivate the zombies, but I am not sure how that character leveling to unlock new puzzles works without zombies.\n\nAs a completionist be warned. You have to play the minigame in the main menu for about 90 to 120 minutes straight. This gets really annoying.\n\nFrom my opinion: I don't want to buy a jigsaw puzzle just to play a top down zombie shooter instead.","March 25","false","11.0"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","2"

It's really challenging, fun and the puzzles are graphically stunning. However, I can't recommend it and here is why.\n\nPros:\n\n♦ Great Graphics (The Graphic design for each Puzzle is stunning)\n♦ Challenging yet fun Gameplay (Having to juggle between completing a Jigsaw Puzzle, Killing Zombies and Staying alive is really nice)\n♦ Nice number of weapon upgrades or completing x amount of the Puzzle (This is a nice reward based concept)\n♦ Great number of Puzzles (Not too many and not too few, about the right number)\n♦ Menu Zombie Kill Minigame is an awesome touch to the main menu (Though it's really hard and doesn't scale properly, by the time you kill 15 Zombies, it's really hard to stay alive no matter what you do)\n♦ Decent Number of relatively easy achievements (This is great as you don't really have to do anything special to get the achievements, the only problem is the main menu minigame achievements)\n♦ Graphically Stunning Steam Trading Cards (This is always a good addition to any Steam Game)\n♦ Decent Price (For the effort that goes into the graphic design of the Puzzles it is worth the price and the Zombie addition gives nice Gameplay)\n\nCons:\n\n♦ No Cloud Save (This is terrible, if a game is on Steam and doesn't make use of this feature... then it shouldn't be on Steam for obvious reasons)\n♦ The Kill 5000 Menu Zombies Achievement is almost impossible (You have to kill all 5000 in one go, which sucks as I found killing 15 to be inbalanced enough)\n\nOverall, for a Jigsaw Puzzle Zombie Killing game, it mixes the two modes together nicely and has way more Pros then Cons. However, for the sole purpose of not having Cloud Storage, I recommend you do not buy this. This is because nowhere does it tell you it doesn't sync to cloud storage and for me, I beat 9 Puzzles and Re-installed Steam for whatever reason and none of my Saves for this game were there. Thus, for a game that takes a lot of time and effort to beat a Puzzle I don't really want to have to redo all 9 Puzzles that I had already completed. Therefore, even though it is a decent game, to save you the hassel of having to start over like I did, I wouldn't recommend it as it doesn't use Cloud Storage.","November 19, 2015","false","2.7"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","9","14","0","0"

But this one has a twist that I think sets it apart.\n\nA TIMER *gasps surround the room in a cacophonous roar that affronts your ears and causes them twitch with fright searching for its source.\n\n(Note: This can be turned off should you just want a normal puzzle solving experience.) The timer counts down to a zombie horde that will attack your base. In between waves, stray zombies will show up to keep you on your toes. What makes this more than just a timer is that must actually shoot the zombies yourself. There is only one lane so its not super demanding but you must WASD around and firing a rifle and throwing grenades allowing yourself enough time to solve the puzzle.\n\nThis makes the puzzle more engaging and frantic as in true survival games resources are scarce. You'll run out of bullets and be forced to solve more of the puzzle in order to get more money to buy more ammo at the shop. There are also mines among other explosives at your disposal that effectively rise in price as the more effective they are at exacting death the more expensive they will be.\n\nIt may not be the most original idea but it is an interesting and novel idea to say the least.","November 14, 2015","true","0.0"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Its easy and somewhat casual fun, not like a serious shooter or puzzle game. Each zombie takes three shots to pop, the waves are easy to take out, the weapons don't upgrade or change.\nOnce I got down to the last four puzzles, it did seem to get a bit harder, but then the technical issues that were minor became impossible to surpass. For one, I couldn't manage to pick up the piece I was clicking on ever floating in the ether along the edges. The pieces that picked up when I clicked directly on one would be seemingly random. The edges of each piece somewhat appear as though they fit together, but often I was just throwing pieces at each other to see what stuck because some patterns were awkward.\nOverall though, I'd recomend it. The begining of it was a blast.

Basically, you solve a puzzle while shooting zombies, and trying to finish the puzzle before the zombies can get to you. Money to buy ammo/traps/barricades is earned by putting pieces of the puzzle together.\n\nOne of the first things I noticed, which may just be a personal bug, was that everytime I closed the game and reopened, it would reset my audio and video settings. Luckily, they are very easy to change, so it isnt a huge deal.\n\nThe puzzles themselves are pretty nice. The art styles differ slightly in between puzzles, as well as the general tone of the puzzles themselves from silly to creepy. The puzzle pieces themselves also differ from puzzle to puzzle in shape. The pieces float around the edge which adds a little challenge when trying to put together the harder puzzles. Grabbing the piece you want gets difficult if there is a piece on top of it or under it, as it seems to guess which piece in the pile you were grabbing rather than tracking which one was clicked on. Not a huge deal as you can just pile the unwanted pieces somewhere on the board until you have room to toss them back in the water, or place them in the puzzle.\n\nThe zombie shooting part isnt my favorite. It adds something of a timer to it since if you dont solve quickly, you run out of money to buy ammo, and when you run out of ammo you die eventually. That said, even on the hard puzzles, the zombies are no harder to kill than they are on the easy puzzles, so its more of a slight distraction while you puzzle solve. Its different at least.\n\nOverall, its a pretty good game. The puzzles are enjoyable, and while the shooting part isnt my favorite, it does grow on you after awhile (or did for me at least). The one bug Ive found isnt a major draw back, and doesnt really effect gameplay, so even with its faults, I still highly recommend it.","September 29, 2015","true","18.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Instead of explaining what the heck a jigsaw puzzle is, I'm going to say what you need to know if you intend to play it right.\n\nPlay it with a big screen, and with a little more brightness than you find necessary.  If your screen is smaller than 19", you're going to have a hard time with the size of the puzzle pieces in the later puzzles.  Also, a lot of puzzles are dark, which becomes a pain in the butt when you are matching various colors of darkness.\n\nYou can turn off the distracting zombies when solving puzzles.  The button to do so is to the right of the "Go" button.\n\nThe menu mini game gives you infinite grenades, and can be thrown with the RMB.  This is how you get those pain in the butt survival achievements.\n\nTo use power ups, such as the extra wall or the trip mine, you need to click and drag with the LMB to place them.  If you don't place them, you still pay for them, even though they don't get used.\n\nExpect each puzzle to take a long time (30min to +120min), and there is no 'save and quit' function to pause in the middle of a puzzle.  You can pause the game with the ESC key, but make sure to plan your games in advance.\n\nI do recommend it to those diehard puzzle game fans (like myself), but this game definitely isn't for everyone.  If the game could be paused and saved for later, I would say it would be a casual game.

Me, being a lover of all things puzzle and zombies thought it's a winning combination.\n\nTurns out, nah.\n\nPixel Puzzles: UndeadZ has two modes: first one can be labeled as survival, second one as peaceful mode. Survival mode lets you control soldier in a topdown perspective shooting aproaching zombies that shamble from left to right, while at the same time you're putting the pieces together. This mode let you buy additional equipment by earning Zombucks (zombie money) everytime you put the piece at the right place. In a way, it makes jigsaw puzzle game a bit tense, which is exactly the opposite of what I want and need when I do puzzles, but if you're into something competitive, there you go.\n\nPeaceful mode makes you put pieces together and unlock additional puzzles (think classic). You start at level 1 with your puzzles consisting of 60 pieces. As you progress, you get more and bigger puzzle sets.\n\nThere are several severe problems with this game. Problem No. 1 lies in the complete lack of customization of puzzles: pictures are 'glued' to number of bits, so if you like a certain motif, you'll only be able to play with it in its default cutout - you can't play 60 bits puzzle in 112 bits mode.\n\nAlso, there's no rotation, puzzle shapes are odd and if you're into something more traditional, you will not appreciate this contemporary approach. Puzzle pictures unfortunately look amateurish and lack the interesting motifs that make you comeback for some more.\n\nAdditional drawbacks for me are 'floating pieces' (check the trailer) and pretty ugly UI and menu solutions.\n\nWould I reccomend it? If you can grab Tabletop Simulator, do it - they have new jigsaw mode that lets you pick your own pictures and number of pieces. If you decide to get this one, wait for a heavy discount. I certainly can't recommend this game at its current price.\n\nP.S.

Namely the fact that all the pieces are floating in a pool, and if two or more pieces are floating around, the game seems to choose from a specific order which one you pick up.  If your like me and you prefer to do the border of the puzzle first, this may help with the top border, but the lower half becomes a hassle due to this mechanic.\n\nOn top of this issue, they added zombies to make this game even more annoying.  You can thankfully do puzzles without the zombies, but there is another issue.  Some of these puzzles are just graphic, including one of what seems to be a female zombie giving birth to a baby zombie.\n\nI can not recommend this game to anybody but a hardcore zombie fan, and somebody who likes doing puzzles as well.\n\nAnd yes, I am fully aware that I've only done maybe 25 minutes of this game.

It's a puzzle, with zombies, how could you go wrong? Unless you don't like puzzles. Or zombies. Then, well, you could go very wrong.\nIn all seriousness, besides being a puzzle game, there is a fun little extra to it. As you piece your puzzle together, you have a simple top-down shooting game happening at the same time. ( It can be turned off if it becomes too distracting.) Mind you, the shooting aspect is rather simple... An occasional zombie shows up, use your keyboard to line him up and shoot him before he breaks down your barricade. At regular timed intervals, a large group of zombies will show up in waves... There's a small sense of depth there, and things can go wrong. As you put the puzzle together, you'll randomly earn cash to stock up on bullets and grenades, even the ability to add more sections of barricades. The shooting part is really very simple, but I'll hand it to the developers- it's a small thing like this that can add quite a bit of fun to the game. It's really only towards the end of the game, (as you complete tiers of the puzzles, the puzzles become broken down into more pieces,) that the shooting game can lead to death. (game over if your soldier dies.) Even then, your soldier dying is usually more based on a combination of bad luck, (not getting pieces laid down that earn you money to restock,) and bad timing. Again though, if the shooting aspect of the game isn't your cup of tea, it can be turned off. Kudos again to the developers for not turning off achievements if a player does so... You'll still earn an achievement for finishing the puzzle regardless of whether you choose to participate in playing the shooting game aspect.\nBefore selecting the puzzle, you can also enjoy a game of shooting zombies, as well... Even achievements for playing this part of the game.\nPerhaps the only major negative I've found is grabbing pieces from the floating current of water that surrounds the top and sides of the board can occasionally be finnicky... It's not HORRIBLE, but I've certainly had my share of trying to grab a piece (usually in the higher piece count boards,) only to have to keep grabbing several times before landing the one i was trying to get... It's rarely been anything more than a slight annoyance.\nOverall, this quickly became my favorite time-waster/ "I only have 15 minutes to play something," game for quite some time. The shooting part was a pleasant surprise, but I've been known to turn it off to just enjoy putting together the puzzle without the distraction.\nIt should be noted that while very cartoony in its art style, a couple puzzles may not be entirely appropriate for the "young'uns," depending on just what your level of tolerance is in regards to what you allow your kids to view.\nFor a jigsaw puzzle game, it's a ton of fun. I enjoy the zombie apocalypse stuff as much as the next guy, so when I found this little gem, combining zombies and puzzles, I couldn't have been happier.\nCurrently on sale for $2.37... At that price, you should be jumping on it!","October 17, 2014","true","6.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's hard to strongly recommend the game as many times the selection of puzzle pieces was very frustrating.  It sometimes seems like the game is determined to give you every piece near the mouse pointer EXCEPT the one you are trying to click on.  You would think that the top piece under the tip of the mouse pointer would be selected, but this isn't the case.  Often a piece under the piece you are targeting will be selected, other times, a piece adjacent to the piece you are targeting gets selected.  Very frustrating.\n\nI like the concept of fighting off a zombie attack while putting together a puzzle and it was fun for the first few puzzles.  After the trouble selecting pieces started, I abandoned the zombie defense and switched to plain puzzle assembly to get through to the end.\n\nTL,DR; Wait for a sale then pick it up cheap.

For the most part the basic premise for the two games is the same. Just replace all the Japanese references with zombie related stuff and you're pretty much covered as far as the fundamentals go. Read that and you'll be up to speed with the rest of where this review is going. Go on, it's cool, I can wait...\n\nOK, so you've read it and now you know what the deal is with that game, right?...\n\nYou haven't read it, have you? Well screw you, buddy. I'm just gonna carry on like you have anyway, so there!\n\nSo while the core concept and gameplay from the previous game is in tact, as well as giving the game a new zombie themed facelift, they've also added a new element into the mix - zombie defense. The jigsaw board and floating puzzle pieces are still there doing their thing, but now there's a second game being played out at the bottom of the screen as well.\n\nA little shotgun-wielding dude stands in a small barricaded area at the bottom right corner of the screen and can be moved around his tiny hidey-hole with WASD, while zombies appear from the left corner and shamble their way toward our hero. Using the Space bar to shoot or Q to toss grenades, you must fend off the threat and survive long enough to complete each puzzle. Ammo and grenades are limited, but can be restocked using currency collected from correctly setting pieces into the board. This currency can also be used to briefly reveal the finished picture within the puzzle board or to purchase additional barricades or claymores which can be placed in pre-set locations along the zombie track at the bottom of the screen to give yourself some additional breathing room. Which you'll need, because a timer is also counting down to a hoard rush that will need all your attention to fend off. So it's a jigsaw puzzle game mixed with some management elements and a little zombie-shooting action.\n\nI love that they didn't just rest on their laurels, but instead really made the effort to add something fresh to the series. But what I love even more is that it's optional and you can turn off the zombie defence stuff at any point if you're not in the mood for it and just want to put a picture together. To be honest, that's what I ended up doing after a few rounds. Don't get me wrong, it's a really nice, competent extra, and I appreciate it being there, but it just wasn't what I was looking for. I came for the basics, so I was happy enough with that.\n\nOtherwise, this is almost exactly the same game as PP: Japan, both good and bad. The pieces can still be a pain to rummage out from the pile, but at least they're now going towards some far more interesting pictures this time. Though, that said, they don't hold back, and even though they're only cartoony illustrations, I could easily see how people who get a little squeamish around gore would feel a bit touchy about this. But other than that, this is a nicely put together, fun little time killer that's as laid back or demanding as you want it to be, and I can't wait to play the rest in the series.\n\n...
