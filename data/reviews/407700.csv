I am not going to go in details but thus far (around 14 hours) I enjoyed every moment in the game and everyone is so friendly, even the developer. As I said, even the developer is active in the game time to time and we went hunting together, he is really friendly and considers every idea/suggestion/critique that you may have for Lonath Online. I also met other players in-game and everyone seemed to be friendly and ready to help with anything. It is a really fun game, which gives you the feeling of a classic isometric-view MMORPG but at the same time with modern features. Even though, I found a few small bugs (none of them affected the gameplay), it is still on its early stage and it really has potential! I will keep you guys updated of how it goes next.","October 18, 2015","true","20.5"," 5 of 13 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","5","13","0","0"

unique cosmetic skins comming soon\n1 Star for Spells any class can cast spells and gain any skill basically you can become a hybrid\n1 Star for character customization basic but yet still cool to look different\n1 Star for the Indie Developer being so friendly kinded and well mannered he obviously cares about his community and how to make his game better\n1 Star for reading my suggestions and actually thinking about implementing some of my ideas/suggestions\n1 Stars for crafting comming in game words from the developer woot\n2 Stars for Archery comming in game words from the developer :D!\n1 star for polymorphing ability from scrolls that drop from mobs allows you to turn into a certain type of monster depending on where you obtained your scroll.\n2 Stars for being able to tame monsters\n1 star for being able to trade others in game\n\nOh yea after 5 hours of playing i finally found myself a treasure map gonna go find the loot soon.Wish me luck :D\n\n\nOveral this game has little to no known bug's and its initial gameplay is fun and exciting you actually have to put effort into fighting there is a skill bar with various spells you can cast all classes can cast any spell depending on there magic level or gear there wearing, certain gears give better bonuses not all gear is the same\n\n5/5 stars for my first time ingame experience :D","October 16, 2015","true","23.1"," 10 of 25 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","10","25","0","2"
