Which is a fantastic game because there so few of these kind of games that actually exist. Solstice is my favorite game of all time, so this hits right at home. Gameplay is so smooth with many options for your control scheme. The music is great, lots of hidden secrets, some challenging puzzles as well. I wish the Story was more flushed out but that doesn't really matter in the end. I can't wait to play this game through to the end. Fantastic buy and would highly recommend to anyone who enjoys puzzles, platforming, or if they are just looking for something a bit different. 9/10!","May 24","true","0.8"," 19 of 22 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","19","22","0","0"

Coupling a insane amount of secrets and puzzles in it's diverse levels.\n\nFull review:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350gUsUdgts\n\nText:\nAs always, watch the video for the best possible impression of the game.\n\nWhile clearly aimed at a younger audience, the game tries to bridge this by adding a ton of secrets and "of the beaten track" methods of playing the game, which it very much succeeds in.\nThe levels are spanning, and while simple on the surface (and mechanically not that hard) the game allows for those younger to enjoy a fun and interesting game... while also stuffing the game to the brim with references and nostalgic throwbacks for those older gamers.\n\nThis brings a duality forth, where younger players might have an interesting game, and those older gamers who find the mechanics to simple to be challenging, can still get a ton of challenge trying to find all the MANY secrets and collectibles.\n\nThere is one major issue i have with the game though: it's controls are VERY sub-par with mouse and keyboard. I found the game a total letdown until i hooked up my steam controller with it. The controls still aren't great, but compared to KB&M they are a world of difference.\n\nAnother issue is that I encountered quite a few graphical glitches. None of them broke the gameplay or puzzles, but they were definitely immersion breaking... which is what the game does rely on quite a bit for it's many references and atmospheric storytelling.\n\nOveral, if you have a younger child or you enjoy collecting / exploring secrets - this game will scratch both those itches.. but if you just enjoy getting to the end of a game, you will most likely find the title way to simple mechanicly.","May 24","true","13.3"," 22 of 33 people (67%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","67","22","33","6","1"

The style is simple and charming. The character is well made, and smoothly animated and moved. There's just enough clutter to make each room interesting without making them overwhelmingly messy, which is a good balance.\n\nAudio: Beautiful music and the sound effects blend well with the rest of the game.\n\nGameplay: it's very classic isometric platforming, with puzzles to solve and loads of little secrets and collectibles. There's very little hand-holding, you simply figure things out for yourself, which is very well done - the progression is steady. It starts out easy and gets quite challenging. It's very charming and fun!\n\nThe control scheme is nicely configurable and can easily be changed on the fly, which is great.\n\nThere's several game modes: "Adventure" and "OldSchool". Adventure gives you unlimited time and lives, whereas Old School limits time you get in each room and lives you have to spend, with no saves or maps. I've been playing Adventure, since I'm not insane. I'll give Old School a try later.\n\nIf you miss the old Spectrum / Amiga isometric puzzlers, or you have no idea what I'm talking about, try this out - it's a fun, charming puzzle game.","May 24","true","7.4"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","11","13","0","0"

It's exploratory genius and I won't be putting this down until completion and that includes me swearing at the monitor due to my countless deaths in trying to collect the ducks.  I've seen a number of "debates" to what constitutes as an isometric game... I don't care. This game delivers on nostalgia with a modern twist.  If this style of isometric look can be called a genre, then I think it's a credible genre of game.  For too many years RPG's used similar perspectives to much love.  I prefer a great little platform game and to see a style like this resurrected makes me grin and run home to play like I were back in school.  Yes folks, and UK citizens of my age will understand the emotion of me referring it to Beano day.  Yep, metaphorically, Gareth Noyce is the paperboy and delivered me a Beano of a game.

It has such a georgeous look and feel, coupled with the chilled ambient electronica atmosphere; it\'s a really lovely looking experience. The gameplay is perhaps not always so relaxing - it being a throw back to 8-bit isometric games such as Knightlore on the BBC Micro, where, for those not old enough to remember, each room is a self contained challenge to get through, and where the perspective is fixed in one corner. That means some interesting puzzling, some navigation through large maze-like levels, and a lot of primarily dexterity-based platform challenges with jumping, rope swinging, avoiding enemies type play. These can be very challenging. The game pushes you, and some rooms might seem impossible at first. It will test you, but that surge of satisfaction when you complete a tough room is unbeatable. I have shouted at my screen in both triumph and despair with Lumo, but when you perfect a room, or when a puzzle just clicks, it leaves you smiling. I\'m not usually a paltformer type of gamer, and I\'m only partway through, but sure, I can wholly recommend this.","June 1","true","6.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The thing is: you'll take a breather, and you'll want to come back to master those jumps, or collect that darn rubber duck, or whatever other secrets there are.\n\nIf you happened to grow up influenced by the UK side of gaming, you'll squeel (well, I did anyway) at delight with the various little cameos out there.\n\nAs far as I'm concerned, it's really the type of game which is charming, challenging, but really solid fun. I'm nowhere near done with it right now, but I find myself going in for a few sessions a day - broken up by the aforementioned getting stuck and wanting to throw a controller around.\n\nSo, pure oldschool bliss then.\n","May 29","true","1.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

While much of the challenge derives from the isometry, which makes judging movement and platform locations tricky, there are tons of skill-based sections later on that require you to make jumps with reactive precision timing. There is quite a bit of replay value due to the many hidden secrets and the "Old-School" speedrun mode, which has limited lives. You have to be a savage platforming god to beat the Old-School mode, and I'm plenty willing to take on that challenge.

It feels like a love song.\nI loved everything. The art style, the music, the puzzles, the physics in the ice levels which I usually hate in every game but just felt so correct here.\nThe difficulty curve is perfectly executed, I know that playing it through for the second time; rooms I thought were tricky first time are now a breeze after having dealt with some of the later offerings. I initially thought it was overkill to have an autosave in every room, but I really do thank the Developers for that having seen some of those trials.\n\nIf I had any critiscisms, they'd be that I was kind of disappointed that I didn't get a total number of deaths when I finished the normal mode, I would have liked a stats screen like you get in the Old School Mode & that it seems if you're holding down 2 directional keys when you leave a room, when the next room loads it will only recognize 1 directional input so you have to remember to lift your fingers when you load a new room.\nThose are very minor critiques.\n\nI thought the price might be too high, I thought the game might be too short, I was wrong; this is worth the money.\nMy first playthrough was 8 hours (I got stuck about 4 times wasting an hour), I didn't collect most of the collectibles; I failed at every mini-game in the Warp Zone.

The game tries to deliver a modern take on the classic formula, but some older ideas do get in the way of making this an amazing trip down memory lane.\n\nOld-School Fun:\n\nThe story of Lumo has the player being trapped in a broken arcade machine and forced to figure out how to escape. While it's not the most in-depth story, it does set the stage for room after room of puzzles. As with the theme of old-school games, the rooms of Lumo are filled with puzzles of varying shape, size and lethality.\n\nThe basic way through the game is to get through each area to ultimately find your way home, but Lumo presents a number of optional objectives, hidden areas and more. Keeping with the old school theme, the game does little to explain its rules and gameplay; forcing the player to dig to figure out what's going on.\n\nThe game features modern and old-school modes, where old-school gives you a limit of lives to solve puzzles. While the basic gameplay doesn't change from start to end, there is a wide variety of obstacles to deal with that help to keep the game fresh, along with video game references and those as-mentioned hidden areas.\n\nLumo is a great example of a game where you can tell that everything was hand-crafted, with each room and zone offering different challenges to test the player.\n\nUnfortunately, what hurts Lumo for me is trying to combine modern and old-school design and not properly meshing well in my opinion.\n\nAwareness Issues:\n\nFirst off, I highly suggest you play Lumo with a gamepad and set the control scheme to modern isometric, where "Up" moves the player up and not diagonally up.\n\nLumo features an isometric camera that gives you a 3/4th view of the proceedings, just like classic games of the genre. Those games worked, because the game space for each room was kept to a cube shape; keeping the player always in the middle of the space.\n\nThe problem with Lumo and trying to grow the game is how the camera and room designs conflict with each other and make the game frustrating to play. When the game makes rooms bigger or alters their shape, the camera itself doesn't compensate or move to help the player. Instead, it stays relatively in the same place and view, and what ends up happening is the player's character is no longer in the center of the screen or the platforms that they need to jump on.\n\nYou can slightly adjust the camera, but nowhere near the point that you need it to be to get the jumping and spatial distances right. For a point of reference, long rooms, rectangle rooms and massive areas were the big offenders with the camera.\n\nYou'll have to make jumps and avoid traps without being able to properly gauge the player's position in relation to them.\n\nThis continues to escalate in difficulty and frustration as you get into the latter half of the game. I eventually reached the point of frustration and decided to quit when the camera and difficulty got too annoying to deal with.\n\nRealizing that, there was no way I was going to play the game on old-school difficulty and have to worry about having a limit on the number of deaths.\n\nBesides making the camera a bit more reactive, a top-down isometric view point would also be good to allow the player to easily gauge distance relationships between the player and what's going on in the room.\n\nAlso compounding frustration is that the game has you repeat environmental challenges when you move back and forth between rooms; forcing the player to repeat the same thing, but backwards. For players who are just going through for the story, this isn't a problem, but it makes it hard to motivate yourself to go after the game's many secrets and collectibles.\n\nA Forgotten Classic:\n\nI really wanted to like Lumo more than I did, but the camera just got in the way too many times to make me want to keep playing or go back for more secrets. If you can put up with it, Lumo is a great take on growing old-school design for a modern audience, but it could do with more elements on the modern side.\n\nFor more on Lumo, you can watch my spotlight video if it on the Game-Wisdom YouTube channel.\n\nCheck out Game-Wisdom[game-wisdom.com], where I examine the art and science of games.","May 25","false","3.9"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","9","16","0","0"

Lumo is an isometric platformer based heavily on ‘Solstice’ for the NES. You’ll play as a really odd individual who’s sucked into a video game. From there, you’ll have to platform your way through over 400 different rooms, solve challenging puzzles, complete mini games, all along your quest to find all the missing rubber ducks!\n\nGameplay wise, it actually plays far more like early pre-analog stick Sony PlayStation 3D platformers. More specifically, it reminds us of Croc Legend Of The Gobbos and Spyro The Dragon. You’ll start off with nothing more than the ability to move, and you’ll eventually gain more powers and more abilities on your way just like the games mentioned. You’ll also eventually come across the equivalency of hub worlds, which allow you to play different sections of the game in any order you chose. Rather than being hub worlds specifically however, it’s more like a room with multiple doors that all follow a cohesive theme. For example at the end of the game, you’ll need to unlock the final piece the game wants you to find in order to win. In that section, you’re given a choice of 4 different doors. Once each puzzle through the door has been completed, the door will lock.\n\nThere’s over 400 isometric-styled rooms to explore, most of which contain a puzzle of some sort. These puzzles can range from a Pac-Man style game where you have to catch ghosts, to balancing on a ball while avoiding falling into the water. The puzzles mostly have a nice rampart in terms of difficulty. Some seem to ramp up as you play too quickly, but they scale fairly well from our time with the game. Every now and again you’ll come across either a rubber ducky or a cassette tape. These are the ‘secrets’ or collectibles for the game. Similar to Spyro, you’ll find a few different types of collectibles that are marked in your pause menu. You’ll also come across different pieces of a map that may help you traverse a level. These were interesting, but it was slightly difficult to really tell what we were looking at and where we were through the map.\n\nBesides the puzzles and secrets, there’s also the platforming to mention. The platforming was frustrating towards the end, but worked well for the most part and (again) went up in terms of difficulty quite well. The game is just filled with a lot of self-awareness and while overdone can be just annoying, it’s played out well in Lumo, with many nods to the developer's inspirations while working on it. While the camera angle is slightly difficult to see certain things, there’s a tilt feature which allows you to tilt the camera slightly left and slightly right. This doesn’t sound helpful, but trust us when we say it’s really helpful for more difficult platforming sections if you plan on collecting all the rubber duckies. There were areas where the tilt didn’t help, but they were few and far between. What did bother us is how the tilt feature was arbitrarily turned off for certain rooms without any indication. Either give us the feature or don’t, but don’t just turn it on or off without somehow informing the player. Despite the minor gripe, the platforming was fun enough. Both it and the puzzles used a lot of gimmicks seen in Spyro, Croc and Solstice. In fact, one puzzle involving moving a cannon to shoot at a certain target above a door to open said door was not so sneakily borrowed from another game.\n\n*Stares at Spyro 3: Year Of The Dragon*\n\nAlong the way, you’ll also discover mini-game sections (similar to the flight sections of Spyro) which include games like space shooters or timed puzzles similar in play style to Marble Madness. It’s interesting to see it played out, but we wish the mini game sections were easier to find. Unlike in those Spyro mini games, it’s not made clear what you’re supposed to do in the Lumo mini games. Because of this, you’ll often sit there wondering where to go or what you’re exactly doing, so a prompt at the beginning of the mini games telling you how to play and the basic rules (similar to how Spyro handled it with the skateboarding sections) would have been helpful.\n\nThe gameplay itself works well enough for us to suggest Lumo to fans of older 3D platformers. It’s a little meh in certain spots, but it works well enough to get by. The platforming does play more like a mix between Croc with Solstice style movements, but that’s just our two cents.\n\nVisually, the game both runs well (we rarely dipped under 200fps with Vsync off) and looks fairly well designed. The snippets we took don’t do the game justice in terms of visual quality. Design wise, levels and characters are designed well enough to be distinct, but not enough to be memorable. In example, while the wizard is well designed, he’s not a memorable enough character to be a mascot for example.\n\nAudio wise, the music was good but again, not really enough to me memorable. We also had the problem of the fact that we couldn’t change the volume for the game, thus making streaming the game almost impossible since we’d have to edit the audio on the fly.\n\nFor the controls, get a controller. The controls are fairly poor for the keyboard and mouse, and one really needs analog stick style movement in order to play the game in the most accurate manner. You can use a keyboard and mouse, as well as the game giving you a few different control schemes to choose from, but the game doesn’t give you full rebindable keys. The only problem we had was that Lumo didn’t detect the buttons on the Xbox One controller as start and select, so it wouldn’t let us see our map or pause the game through the controller. Because of this, we had to switch to one of our Xbox 360 controllers. The settings for visuals are actually quite diverse and was a nice change of pace from the majority of indie games we’ve played recently. With that out of the way, there’s no way at all to edit audio settings for the game itself other than turning the volume down in the volume mixer on Windows, and it would be helpful to change the audio.\n\nThis then comes down to entertainment and conclusion. Was the game fun? Yes, absolutely. However, we should add that we grew up with games like Solstice, and enjoy a lot of 3D platformers. The game is slightly shorter at 5ish hours, but it also encourages playing 2 or 3 times thanks to its replay factor. There’s a few things that fall into ‘meh’ like the music and level design, but it also introduces characters with personality without any dialogue, but doesn’t move that idea forward to the level design, leaving certain areas feeling bland and slightly uninspired. So to conclude, do we suggest this game? Yes. The nitpicks we have with the game don’t stop the game from still being fun if 3D platformers are your thing. We’ll leave the reader to decide if it’s worthy of discount status or not, but we had fun with Lumo, and we think it’s at the very least worthy of playing and feels sequel worthy to us.\n\n\nPROS\nEnjoyable platforming\nNice ramp up of puzzle and level difficulty through progression\nControls for the controller (minus the issue we had) were spot on\nNice selection of references to inspiration for the game\nLooks nice visually\n\nMEH\nMusic and characters are well done, but slightly forgettable\nThe minor controller issue with the Xbox One controller we had.\nMore/any outdoor areas would be a nice thing to see\n\nCONS\nNeeds a larger variety of puzzles\nSettings for audio adjustments.\n\n\nIf you'd like to see the version on our website (it's the same thing but with pictures) click here: http://yourwolfsdengaming.com/2016/05/26/lumo-review-yourwolfsdengaming/","May 26","true","5.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game's camera angle provides much of the challenge, as well as offering unique gameplay that is rarely seen in games today. There are two difficulty modes in Lumo: adventure, and old-school. Adventure mode offers unlimited lives and allows the player to make as many mistakes as needed, only resetting them to the beginning of the room when they die. Old-school mode, on the other hand, offers a limited amount of lives and forces the player to be much more cautious in their playing if they want to make it through the whole game. Lumo offers a lot of variety in gameplay, with each area in the game having its own unique set of mechanics, keeping the gameplay fresh the whole way through. There is also a large amount of hidden content and challenges scattered throughout the game, providing an incentive for multiple playthroughs. You will die, you will get frustrated, you will curse the camera, and you will have a ton of fun in the process. Overall, Lumo is a great game and I highly recommend it.","May 26","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
