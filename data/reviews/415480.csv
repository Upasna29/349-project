"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pepsimanvsjoe/recommended/415480/","pepsimanvsjoe","pepsimanvsjoe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pepsimanvsjoe/","1281 products in account","Now you've been following Gamindustri for quite awhile, but have you ever heard of Gamarket? If you're a long-time fan of the Neptunia franchise, then you're aware that there are many dimensions. In Gamarket, Noire rules. Thanks to the help of her 18 generals, she has defeated the other CPUs, and is well on her way to achieving total domination...well... was anyway. It seems that she has had a temporary setback, and it's up to you, the player, to get her back on her feet. With your help, Noire just might be able to unite Gamarket. Hey, you might even get the opportunity to win over the Goddess of Lonely Hearts. I wish I was joking about that last part.\n\nWhen designing a spin-off, it's important to consider the intended audience. While it makes sense that fans of the Neptunia RPGs can also enjoy other genres, there has to the right balance of depth and fun-factor, or else the developer risks pushing those fans away. In this regard, Hyperdevotion Noire: Goddess Black Heart is a success. It delivers a thoroughly competent S-RPG, without drowning players in stats and a multitude of convoluted sub-systems. The "nendoroid" art-direction suits the game-play portions really well. The visuals help set the game apart from other entries in the franchise.\n\nThe GameTypically, your battle strategy is going to revolve around something I like to call the "PECK" system. Whenever a heroine performs an ability while next to an ally, she gets a little kiss on the cheek. This reduces the cost of the move, boosts its damage, and awards meter for performing special attacks. Naturally, you'll want to group up as often as possible, but this will make the party more susceptible to AOE spells and the like. It's a trade-off you'll learn to respect, as your foes will take every opportunity, to do a lot of damage all at once. Keep in mind also that almost every heroine has one or two buff abilities. There will be times when your allies make a move, and there aren't any nearby enemies to attack. The game is subtly telling you to prepare for the next round. Although, I can't say that I appreciate that lily-ranks are tied to PECK. You'd better be looking forward to a ginormous amount of smooching, if you want to get all of the achievements.\n\nEarly on you'll decide the elemental-affinity of the CPUs and Generals you recruit. Almost all monsters are strong or weak to certain elements. Outside of a few exceptions, your party will always consist of at least four members. Since there are four elements, it's only logical to use the entire spectrum. Hammering this point home is the fact that most treasure-chests are locked, and only the right elementally-aligned character can open them. As with other Neptunia games, most of the treasures are materials used to craft weapons and armor.\n\nThe battles themselves tend to have different objectives beyond "kill all of the monsters". The maps can have trapped floors, varying heights, and a host of other aspects to account for. The heroines can even lift and throw objects, just in case they need to reach higher-ground. Thankfully, traversing the map never becomes something akin to a puzzle game.  You're not going to spend several minutes messing around with geo-panels, geo-blocks, or all of those other geo-whatsits. A lot of battles in HD Noire have gimmicks, but for the most part, they're clever and offer a nice touch of variety.\n\nThe difficulty of this game is fairly open-ended. While you're free to choose a level of difficulty, at the beginning, you'll have better luck making things more challenging by avoiding the optional quests. The story battles award enough experience to keep everyone at a reasonable level anyway. You can also use weaker party-members, or avoid certain equips and abilities. All told, HD Noire is kind-of simplistic, but it's really entertaining. Although, enemies not being affected by traps can take a little while to get used to.\n\nThe StoryWhen it comes to the Neptunia franchise, its greatest strengths tend to lie in its storyline and characters, or at least I think so. While the Candidates don't make an appearance in HD Noire, the four Goddesses are joined by the aforementioned 18 generals. Each chapter usually involves putting a stop to whatever the generals are planning, and then recruiting them to your party. It's a predictable setup, but it has some amusing moments. However, there are times where the story feels rushed, or certain events happen just to draw everyone into a fight. I don't mind, since it's nice to have boss-fights that are unique and interesting.\n\nThe biggest problem with the story is you, the player, aka the secretary. While you never take an active role in battle, you're present in nearly every story scene. There's also a "Sim-Noire" mode where you purchase furniture, and answer questions that best align with Noire's personality. I have no why this game needed such a blatant player-insert character. Essentially all you do is kiss Noire's behind, until the game decides that you should do or say something inspirational.\n\nAwhile back I played through another game by Sting Entertainment called Dungeon Travelers 2*. The fan-service levels in this D-RPG are off the charts. Even the monsters look like scantily-clad women. Anyway, you play the role of a young man who forms a battle-party, to hunt and research these monsters. Despite being the only male character in the game, and getting involved in enough harem incidents to blot out the sun, you're still a well-designed player-insert. You also show a high-level of aptitude when it comes to adventuring. It's nice that you handle the many, many lewd situations, in a intelligent and respectful manner as well. By comparison, your role in HD Noire is a liability.\n\nI don't like to draw comparisons, but with DT2, I had every expectation that my eyes would roll out of my head and then around the world. As it turns out, I was pleasantly surprised by how well-done the character-writing was. HD Noire is too basic and predictable. The 18 Generals are mostly fodder for sight gags and quirky speech patterns. Noire aside, the CPUs don't recieve any development, and Neptune is more grating than ever. The player-insert is flat and uninteresting, but everyone thinks he's handsome and agreeable, so I guess it's supposed to work out? The relationship between you and Noire is a mess, and does nothing but induce vomiting. This is one of the rare benefits of having an extended multiverse. What happens in Gamarket, stays in Gamarket, and thank goodness for that.\n\nThe ConclusionStoryline aside, Hyperdevotion Noire: Goddess Black Heart is a fun experience. It encapsulates all of the elements that make up a quality S-RPG. Granted, it doesn't have the depth and customization that will appeal to the most hardened of veterans. In a way this can also be considered a positive, but maybe it's just me. My most-played S-RPG is Shining Force 2, partly because it's so easy to just pick up and play. In short, this game has most of everything one could ask for in a spin-off. Just don't be afraid to press the start button to skip cut-scenes, especially whenever the subject of conversation is you.\n\n*It's honestly one of the better dungeon-crawlers that I've played.\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","April 26","true","32.1"," 157 of 195 people (81%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","81","157","195","8","14"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rankmenotplz/recommended/415480/","rankmenotplz","ReadingLies","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rankmenotplz/","2045 products in account","Good news to Noire fans as our Goddess finally gets her time to shine! This turn-based TRPG spin-off from the Neptunia series deliver in both cuteness and comedy in style.\nGame Overview\nHyperdevotion Noire - Goddess Black Heart is set in the world of "Gamarket" and is divided into four regions namely Planeptune, Lastation, Lowee, and Leanbox which are overseen by their respective Goddesses (to whom they refer as CPUs).\n\nThe setting is pretty much the same with Hyperdimension Neptunia Series' "Gamindustri", however instead of the people representing game companies, Gamarket's populace is represented with popular games in different kinds of genre (some of them even takes the name of the game itself as character name).\n\nThe gameplay focuses on a standard turn-based, tactical rope-playing game (TRPG) melded with the mechanics and features of a Hyperdimension Neptunia series standard. Another similarity to its other games is that the story progression is divided into chapters and can be triggered by clearing the main missions, which will also lead into more character choices for you to choose from.\n\nNot only that, the game also features a dating-simulation mode with the game's main heroine, Lady Noire, in which you as the player becomes a part of the story by taking in the role of a secretary. Progressing this mode isn't that much crucial to the story, but it will yield you more "extra scenes" with the goddess that is a fitting reward by itself.\n\n\nThe Pros\nQuality Art Design - The same quality content and art design that IdeaFactory and Compile Heart presents with each of their games are still present in this one. Most of our main heroines' character designs have also been altered to make it more noticeable that it is a spin-off from the original series as well as the game promoting a more cute-ish approach with their chibi styles, which is pretty much a plus as it wouldn't hurt to have more flavors, wouldn't it?\n\nGreat Audio - Impressive voice overs that is upheld in quality and are both available in English and Japanese versions are still present in the game (which is a big plus for me since I am a big fan of the Japanese Voice overs). The soundtracks and the effects perfectly fits the game's theme and rhythm which is pleasant to the ears. And as always, these tracks are all available for listening in the game's audio menu (which can be found in the CPU Hotel).\n\nBalanced Game Difficulty - The game has a pretty good curve in terms of difficulty (as long as you don't use stuff from the DLCs which will make the game lesser of an effort to clear, and is clearly aimed for collectors and it's aesthetics) and has toned each of those in their respective aspects. The game might seem simple even on hard mode on the first chapter, but it'll pick up an increasing spike as you progress further into the game.\n\nTons of Content - Another aspect that comes back to this spin-off is the quantity of content which contributes to the game's longevity as a whole. You can grind on the side-quests which could help you go unlock items to be "developed" or if you're not much into that, you can focus on the "dating simulator" part of the game with Lady Noire (talking furniture included).\n\nThe Cons\nRepetitive Gameplay - While there are many other things that you can do besides the classic grinding, progressing through battle mode (missions) is the one that you can't help but repeat many times since the dating simulator mode requires you to at least finish a mission before proceeding with new content, and the same with collecting items and recipes to unlock certain goods. And even if they spice it up with some additions, the goal to reach the end is mostly the same for each mission.\n\nCapped Frame Rate - Most of the time, the reason to why gamers prefer buying the PC version of games is because it mainly offers superior graphics and/or smoother gameplay that is delivered by having the game perform at 60 FPS (Frames per second), however this game has it capped at 30 FPS which is the same thing that the consoles have, which could've been at least tweaked for the PC port release.\n\nGame Bugs - Me and my friend who recently bought the game had some troubles with the game's fullscreen mode when alt-tabbing/escaping (though it might not be that much of a deal since the game works perfectly and most of the time, the preferred mode is borderless, this is just to cover all bases). My issue is that the game crashes when I do the alt-tabs and my friend reported me that it makes the game revert to a windowed screen mode after alt-tabbing. UPDATE: So far, most likely due to nature of a PS Vita Port, the quick save can only be used ONCE and cannot be overwritten nor deleted.\n\nThe Verdict\nFor long time fans, I think I don't even need to say it for them to get the game.\nAnd for those who are new to the franchise, I can pretty much guarantee that this game is worth the value (especially with that 40% cut right off the bat!).\n\nIf you like to see more recommended games that is worth the value you are paying, please visit my other reviews, or follow our curator group at Good Games Giveaways & Reviews.","April 26","true","41.6"," 79 of 95 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","79","95","0","2"

I'm done with the Neptunia series. I love anime, and I like your art style, but the quality is just not there. You guys aren't even trying anymore. The jokes are stale and character development is non-existent. The dialogue runs in circles of anime cliches to nowhere, directing a plot that could've been dreamed up by a bored horny 6th grader in history class learning about the American revoluton for the 500th time, which, incidentally, is not a bad analogue for how it feels to play these games now.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zurarara/recommended/415480/","zurarara","Aruz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zurarara/","308 products in account","I'll start with the cons, as they're pretty short and minor.\n\nCons:\n- NO NEPGEAR (Or any of the other CPU Candidates)\n- 30 FPS Lock (Not that big a deal since it's a strategy game, but still a slight negative for me)\n- Sound issues; the music does not loop well so it'll just restart abruptly in the middle of basically anything\n- Due to its chibi-style, in-game graphics are rather weak. Charming, but could've been a lot better. And like all other Neptunia games, assets are recycled hard.\n- Not sure if it's just me, but for some reason I don't get achievement notifications until I exited out of the game and got a bunch at once.\n- Slighty annoying controls; they're pretty standard, but some things are just a little annoying and I'll detail them a little more below.\n\nProblems I have with control scheme (using an xbox 360 controller, I don't know about keyboard controls):\nDuring the battle setup, you can only go through enemy units based on a list. Can't freely move around and check stuff yourself.\nBuff/debuff information not readily available; need to press B on a character to see it\nThe left analog stick is used to control the camera (as are the LB and RB buttons for 90 degree intervals), and the right stick is used to control the zoom. This would've been much nicer having LB/RB control zoom, and right stick control camera.\nWhile the game will tell you, this is nice to know earlier: You can slightly affect the path your unit takes by changing its orientation before moving (X on gamepad)\nThat's all I find wrong with the game.\n\nPros:\n+ Gameplay is fun (like a weaker fire emblem, sorry that's the only other grid-based strategy game I've played so it's the only comparison I can make). Mechanics are all explained when necessary and are not difficult to understand and remember.\n+ Incentive to buy stuff from the shop with the "Noire's Room" simulation thing. Since the game is Noire focused, the global "EVENT!" things from the previous games are all focused around Noire now.\n+ The characters so far are fun and cute. The CPUs have the same personality as their other games so no surprises there.\n+ They have replayable missions with rewards that change from the first time you beat them, giving you a reason to do it again (and a way to grind up any characters who may have lagged behind)\n+ Same charm and humor as the other games.\n\nI would recommend the game. It's a lot better than the other spin off on steam, Hyperdimension Neptunia U: Action Unleashed. That said, do remember that this is a strategy game. It may not be to your liking. If that's the case, remember you can refund it within a week if your playtime is under 2 hours.\n\nAnd since some of you might be confused by the DLC, it's all pretty much just OP items, not necessary at all.\nThe only exceptions are: "Ultimate Event Full Unlock", which unlocks all gallery items (I'm like 80% sure you can unlock them all in-game anyway, this is just a shortcut), and the four bonus characters: Tiara from Fairy Fencer, IF and Compa from the main games, and Sting, who is just a DLC-original character for this game (I looked it up to verify). I would consider those 4 characters to be the only DLC worth getting, don't bother with any of the gear packs.","April 26","true","18.7"," 35 of 44 people (80%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","80","35","44","5","3"

O_O","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JessyWessyPuddingInPie/","189 products in account","Idea Factory has yet released another installment for the Neptunia franchise on Steam for PC players to enjoy!\nThis time around, it's another spinoff surrounding by our CPU of Lastation, Noire! (Or... Black Heart if you prefer that)\n\nBeing a spinoff from the main Re;birth games. This time around we are leaving the world of RPG to a SRPG styled gameplay with our beloved and soon to be beloved characters chibi-fied! That's right, all those chibi artworks you may have seen floating around the net as pictures or merch created by Tsunako-san shall now come to life and ready for action.\nAlso to note, this takes in the world of Gamarket (See what they did there, so punny! (....*walks away* I know, that was lame... xD))\n\nIn regards to gameplay, it's slower than your usual battles from the main game. When your characters move they have  a specific range in which you can select to move to. Items and activating HDD is same as ever. There are no maps. Like, Neptunia U. The story proceeds through doing quests! But not to worry, our hidden boxes and items are stillin the game but in battle as treasure chests... :3\nLily Ranks are now triggered using SP Skills and Moves if characters are adjacent to each other. I find that a nice touch because this means you can rank up more than 1 time in battle.\n\nSome additional info, this is the first time I've encountered a Neptunia crash when opening the game (I was quite surprised since I own all the games and never experienced it). For those who are having trouble, I'd like to share how I resolved this. Set the game as an Administrator and run Windows 8 Compatibility Mode. It works for me and I have Windows 8.1 (Yes, I haven't upgraded lol). So yeah!

At least I was able to finish Re;Birth 2. The reason for this is a personal preference, at for other people this might be no problem, so unless you share the feeling you might actually like this game.\n\nBasically, it's the "Player" thing. One thing is having to play as a protagonist character with a defined personality and behavior. You might agree more or less with the character, but it's someone else, in the end. But not in here. Noire is kind of the protagonist, sure, but "your character" is there. A faceless, voiceless character names "Player", who is male, and represents you. And whenever he talks it means he's putting words in your mouth. And I don't like the words he puts in my mouth.\n\nThe Hyperdimension Neptunia franchise's cast is composed by 99% female characters. Buuuuut you get to be represented as a male one. Why? Obviously for the simDate effect. Forced to have a generic male simDate character as your avatar in the game to appeal to the target audience of the game, I guess.\n\nIn my opinion, to make it more like a Neptunia game and not just a Nep-themed simDate, I'd have placed another female character who drops videogame references like everyone else. It'd make one feel more inmersed withing the setting if one's character is simmilar to the rest.\n\nAnyway, as I said first, this is a personal preference, and other players might not be bothered at all by this, but it does bother me a lot. I guess this will be the only Nep game I won't finish.","April 29","false","0.6"," 32 of 47 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","32","47","0","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/arborday/recommended/415480/","arborday","arbor day","http://steamcommunity.com/id/arborday/","595 products in account","Much like Hyperdimension Neptunia U: Action Unleashed, this is another spin-off of the Hyperdimension Neptunia series. This time, they went full on SRPG, grid and all.\n\nIf you've played the main entries in the series (if not, I'll sum it up at the bottom), a lot of the staples are here. There's item plans to craft, discs to burn, and a bunch of processor equipment you won't ever bother using. Oh, there's also still a ton of anime boobs, so if that's your thing, no need to worry about that being left out.\n\nGameplay is pretty similar to other SRPGs you might have played, such as Final Fantasy Tactics or Disgaea. As mentioned before, the playing field is on a grid. Turns are divided into a player phase and an enemy phase, instead of rotating through all active combatants based on speed. You can activate HDD mode on the characters to give them boosts. This can only be used once per character per fight, lasts 3 turns, and makes a huge difference if used correctly. Some characters, like Noire, get extra bonuses in this form as well. She can act twice per turn in HDD form, for instance.\n\nThe world map is very similar to the main games, where you just pick different icons on a map (or a list, if you want) for things like the shop, making plans, and the like. There's an option for the missions as well, so don't think you're going to wander around a map and get in fights like in Final Fantasy Tactics. It's much similar to Disgaea in this regard. There are story missions as well as side missions, and you can replay the story missions in a simulation mode. This allows you to use any characters you'd like for the missions instead of who was required in the story, and gives you different rewards for completion of the mission as well.\n\nExperience is awarded per action instead of per kill, similar to most SRPGs. You will usually get a tiny bit more for a kill, but any valid action other than moving will earn you something. This makes it worth your while to spam super weak healing items each turn if you don't have a real action you want to take.\n\nThe story cutscenes are the same as the main series. You'll see a lot of the same backgrounds and characters you did in those games, as well as a lot of the same enemies because everyone knows they love recycling assets at Idea Factory. I'm just saying what we're all thinking.\n\nThe lily system is here as well, but it is a bit different. Standing next to one or more characters when you use a skill will cause the nearby characters to (ugh) kiss you on the cheek, lowering the SP cost of the skill and raising your LP (Lily Points?) and possibly your lily rank. LP is reset after each battle, is one total for the whole party, and ranges from 0 to 100, raising by 20 per kiss. If you get kissed by more than one character at a time, each kiss will give less than the full 20 points, however. Still, it's not a big downside; getting kissed twice at the same time gives 30, which is fine. You can spend all 100 for a strong attack, and you need 30 to activate HDD mode.\n\nThe challenge system from Hyperdimension Neptunia 3 is back. If you're not familiar with this, it's a list of various things that when completed give some bonus to the character. Each challenge has various ranks, with the required number of the action and the bonus increasing as the rank goes up. For instance, moving a total of 25 spaces as a character will complete rank 1 of their movement challenge and award them +2 agility, if I'm not remembering incorrectly. It might not sound like much, but a lot of these are basically free stats, as you will complete a lot of these without even trying. The stat increases for the higher ranks get better as well, and they stack. Sadly, the required number of actions for the higher ranks will climb to ridiculous levels right along side the stats. You probably *will* have to try to complete the higher ranks of most challenges.\n\nThere's a new system where you earn sim points as you buy things from the shop. These points can be spent in a Noire sim mode, which is basically buying her things for her bedroom and upgrading the actual room itself. You also get requests from citizens in this mode, which function a lot like the quests in the main series, except without the actual quest. You just pick a choice from a menu to solve their request, and bingo. It's done. Picking the "correct" response can lead to getting some extra stuff, like events in the sim mode.\n\nGood luck picking the correct responses without a guide, though. You're given a couple options for what action to take on the request, and most choices are just two words long. This doesn't really give you enough information to know what the choice is actually going to mean in the context of the request. Often times you'll get a request that is something like "I want to do a thing!" and you have a response that is "do thing." Does this mean you are telling them to do the thing? Does this mean YOU are doing the thing? Is it considered a correct reply? Who knows! Pick it and find out! Or, get a guide.\n\nOne neat thing I have to point out is that this game has an option to skip battle animations and things, or to play them at double speed. You can turn this on in the options menu, or you can leave it off and just mash the A button to skip animations at will. This is a great feature, and I'm glad to see it return in this entry in the series.\n\nThe series also brought along one of the negatives that all other entries have had, and that is a lack of video options. I know these games are ports, but I really don't like seeing PC games that don't really offer options to tweak the video. You can change the resolution, and turn off detailed shadows, but that's about it. Don't expect any options like texture quality or SSAO. On the otherhand, the game doesn't demand a beastly computer to run fine, so this most likely won't have an impact on your ability to play the game. It still makes me sad, though.\n\nIf for some reason you are totally unfamiliar with this series, just think Final Fantasy Tactics or Disgaea with more moe fan service and a meta narrative that thinks it is being super clever about the video game industry. That's basically what you get with these games.\n\nThat all being said, they are pretty damn solid rpgs with some interesting mechanics. If you aren't totally put off by the over the top moe anime stuff and like the genre, I highly recommend them.\n\n[If I didn't cover something you think I should have, let me know and I'll update this review.]","April 29","true","20.5"," 17 of 21 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","17","21","0","14"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Avensol/recommended/415480/","Avensol","Avensol","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Avensol/","34 products in account","I had a small amount of trouble setting this game up at first. While the game itself is rather good, the shoddy porting and over-pricedness is quite off-putting.\n\nNegatives:\n\nUnlike IF's previous PSVita port (Hyperdimension Neptunia U: Action Unleashed) there are no issues with fuzzy screen resolution, the only fixes for which were to either utilize NVIDIA DSR, or to use some software called GeDoSaTo to render the game in 4k and then downscale it to 1080p (Both of these methods would break the Steam overlay in different ways as sacrifice for having real 1080p). However with this not being an issue in Hyperdevotion Noire, there are even more problems than last time. When the game is set to fullscreen, minimising it causes it to crash. The framerate is locked at 30fps regardless of your video settings (The refresh rates are even listed next to the chosen screen resolution, making it even more irritating). This gets very annoying as all the previous HDN PC games had smooth-as-silk lovely 60fps. What's more, it made me realise how choppy 30fps actually is. Hopefully someone will eventually write a patch in the form of an executable file where you can just open it once, click 'patch' and then you're done with it, forever. While you can remap the controls on your keyboard (but let's be honest, HDN games aren't supposed to be played on a keyboard), you cannot remap the controls on your gamepad. I see no acceptable reason for this, whether it is a bug or is intentional. There are always going to be people who have custom button maps for different games, so if your game allows for the use of a gamepad then the ability to remap it should be there, no question. The BGM does not loop properly, it reaches the loop point, goes slightly beyond that and then jumps back to the beginning. While this may not annoy most people, it most definitely annoys an Audiophile like myself. This next gripe isn't a bug, but is definitely the product of some lazy programming. The monster drop loot isn't 100% random. What I mean by this is that for example, if I were in a mission full of multiples of the same monster that has the potential to drop a plethera of different items, each one of those monsters is locked to a specific selection of the drops it is supposed to yield. Basically, if there is a specific item you are after from that monster, you have to attack a specific one of those monsters, even though they are all the same monster. I would also have liked to see a feature where you can speed through the enemy's turn, because it does feel a bit sluggish at times.\n\nPositives:\n\nI rejoiced when I noticed that IF had finally come out of the Dark Ages of PC gaming, and there was an option for anti-aliasing in the video settings. The actual gameplay itself is quite enjoyable, and I feel that this style of Strategy RPG fits the Neptunia genre quite nicely. The gratuitous 4th wall breaking dialogue never ceases to amuse me. While I am aware that other people think that the missions are boring, it is called a strategy game for a reason. You do have to plan stuff out and use your head to be good at it, so if that doesn't tickle your fancy then you shouldn't have bought the game in the first place in full knowledge of the fact that it's a strategy based RPG, only to complain about it. Some people are put off by the fact that Noire meets a guy that she fancies and has a minor love rivalry with Saori. To be honest, I don't understand these complaints either. It's an HDN game with Noire as the main character this time, and with her lonely nature, it actually seems quite fitting to have this little addition in the story. Nor do I understand why people hate the lily boost system. It's in the game because it fits the style of combat layed out for the dungeons. Deal with it. If you're really one of those people who enjoys fanservice, you definitely shouldn't be complaining.\n\nVerdict:\n\nGood story, good gameplay, shoddy porting, laced with pesky bugs. Buy it if you're a tolerant and patient person, and you like Hyperdimension Neptunia. If you don't fulfill both of those criteria, save your money so that you in turn don't clog up the forums. Two birds with one stone.\n\n7.5/10 or A- or however you grade games these days I dunno any more...","May 3","true","77.8"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Psygineer/recommended/415480/","Psygineer","Psygineer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Psygineer/","1509 products in account","Indroduction\nHyperdevotion Noire: Goddess Black Heart takes the series familiar CPUs in a new direction once again, this time taking the series into the turn-based, tactical role-playing strategy realm.\n\nGameplay\nHyperdevotion Noire: Goddess Black Heart sets itself apart from the previous Hyperdimention Neptunia games available on Steam in several ways. The number one way is the game is now more about tactics and strategy than it previously had been. Using the terrain to your advantage is one of the strategy elements. Each weapon type in the game has its own hit box. For example, spears can hit two squares away but can’t hit a higher or lower elevation. On the other hand, swords are limited to one square away but can hit one level above or below.  A hit from the side or the back will do more damage than hitting a character from the front and also reduces their chance to counter attack. You need to plan your moves out carefully as all characters have a limited amount of mobility. For instance, you cannot walk through an enemy or go over a wall with a higher level than your jump score will allow you to scale. This means you can easily get yourself trapped in a corner if you don’t plan your route carefully. In addition to having to figure out where you want to end up once you make your single move for that turn, you need to pay attention to the route your character plans to take to get there. Your characters are a bit like Lemmings that will blindly fling themselves over ledges or walk into traps if you tell them to. Changing the direction your character is facing allows you to adjust their route to help avoid those situations. Just because you dodged a trap doesn’t mean it won’t get you though. If you stop next to a trap, an enemy will often use its knockback attack to try to push you into the trap setting it off.  As you can see, there is a lot of planning, strategy and tactics involved in this game but there is even more than that to consider.\n\nEach character in the game has its own abilities. Using these abilities, regardless of the intended target, will cause any characters that are one square away from the user to boost that ability’s effect. This means that if you cluster five of your characters in a plus shape and have the one in the middle cast a buff or long range attack, the other four characters will “peck” the caster enhancing the effect and boosting their Lily Ranks in the process. The higher the Lily Rank, the more effective the boost will be. You may be thinking that a good strategy would be to cluster your units and let the enemy come to you. There is a drawback to that plan though; some abilities can hit multiple targets. Instead of hitting just one of your characters with their strong attack, it’s possible they could hit multiple or all of them. Now you can see the tactics in this game are quite complex and not to be taken lightly. There is one more thing to cover on the tactics side though.\n\nElements are introduced as a way to play a pseudo rock, paper, scissors game. One element is stronger against another element but in turn is weaker to yet another element. Some chests found in the levels can only be opened using an elementally infused normal attack (skills and abilities usually have no effect on objects). Having characters with each of the elements available will aid you in looting each of the levels effectively assuming the characters have the ability (jump score, etc.) to reach the chest before the rest of your crew either kills off the enemies, or the enemy you were saving alive dies to a counter attack.  There are still more tactical elements to this game, but I will leave those to you to discover.\n\nHyperdevotion Noire: Goddess Black Heart features a crafting system. As you kill various monsters and complete missions you will aquire drops. These drops allow you to fabricate various things you will need to survive. Better weapons and items can all be crafted. This is where the strategy comes into play. Each piece of equipment has different effects. Sometimes you must make a trade off. To increase your movement range, you may have to reduce your defense a smidge. For the most part, you only need to craft a new item once for it to then appear in the store. This means you don’t have to worry too much about tracking down something you don’t currently have enough of to make another of the same. Buying from the store has its advantages too. Whenever you make a purchase you get Sim Points. Consider them like customer loyalty points of sorts. You will use these points to upgrade Noire’s house. The various things you buy will be added to her home and you can talk to them to get tips or fun conversations. You can also craft and name your own games within the game. Games are an upgrade that allows you to pick and choose what perks you want based on the elements that went into making the game.\n\nHyperdevotion Noire: Goddess Black Heart isn’t set in Gameindustri like the Hyperdimention Neptunia series, it is set in Gamarket. The four CPU Goddesses are all vying for total control of Gamarket. The series, if you are completely unfamiliar with it, is a satire of the current game market. Each of the CPUs represents one of the major console brands. Noire of Laststation, who as the title suggests is the star of the game much to Neptune’s displeasure, tries to end the fighting by listening to a strangers suggestion. This leads all of the Shares (think of them as likes/upvotes/retweets) in the land to disappear leaving the CPUs powerless and Gamarket in a political power vacuum.  I won’t spoil the story by going further, but it is quite in-depth. Much like previous games in the series, the gameplay is bookended by long expositional scenes. These are often cute, humours and quite enjoyable. It can also be quite fun trying to figure out who the next General pays homage to. For example, one of them named Lid, is a Solid Snake reference. She likes hiding in cardboard boxes and using air ducts to move around.\n\nThe art style in this game might be a little off-putting to some at first, but eventually it grows on you even if you had doubts going in. The Anime style characters are now Chibi during game play and resume their usual Anime form when talking to each other between missions. Chibi means they have oversized heads and tiny bodies. The style actually suits the way the battlefield works, and I think that having normal characters would have likely looked a bit weird there. Being Chibi lets you see their face clearly so you know who it is you are controlling just by looking at them. If you are being off put by the Chibi art style and plan on skipping it for solely that reason, you are doing yourself a great disservice.\n\nOverall, Hyperdevotion Noire: Goddess Black Heart is a great turn-based, tactical role-playing strategy game. It is reminiscent of Final Fantasy Tactics so if you enjoyed that take on the Final Fantasy series, you will more than likely enjoy this take on the Hyperdimention Neptunia series. Current fans will not be disappointed either!\n\nPros:The game looks good. Even though my system barely meets the requirements it looks great\nTactical elements work really well\nCrafting system makes having to redo levels to grind Lily Ranks more enjoyable\nSim Noire gives you are reason to spend your money rather than horde it\nMultiple difficulty settings\n\nCons:\n\nThere is a ton of DLC at launch","April 26","true","53.3"," 29 of 49 people (59%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","59","29","49","5","7"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zorder/recommended/415480/","zorder","Zorder","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zorder/","2002 products in account","First of all, I have to say that this is the first time I play a game of the Neptunia series. I always heard great many things about this franchise, not only because of the half naked females of course, but also for its rather interesting setting that tends to appeal to gamers and the huge amount of customization and turn-based combat that these games tend to provide and so, because of that, I decided I’d give this one a chance. So far, for someone who had never played a game of this series before, I must say that I’m really enjoying the universe so far and I plan to play the other games as well.\n\nStory:\n\nHyperdevotion Noire: Goddess Black Heart takes place in the world of Gamarket, a place where games are released at an unrelenting pace, which is also divided into four different nations, each with its own rulling goddess, or CPU - Console Patron Unit. These nations are constantly at war with each other, seeking to expand their control and convert the faith of the citizens into power in the form of shares.\n\nThanks to the evil plot of a certain mysterious character, a chain of unfortunate events starts to unfold, which results in the breakdown of the Sharicite, the physical representation of the peoples shares and the CPUs power. This forces the four goddesses to unite themselves in order to save the world of Gamarket. While I assume that this will feel like a very generic storyline to some people, I like it and find it rather interesting and each of the characters is unique and has its own personality.\n\nGameplay:\n\nI think I wouldn’t be mistaken if I said that the game is split 50/50 by two very different genres. It is a mixture of a visual novel with tactical/strategy RPG elements, such as party turn-based combat.\n\nThe visual novel part of the game is pretty much just dialogue, which is voice acted for the most part. You’ll spend a lot of time interacting with the main protagonist, Noire, the CPU who presides over Lastation, one of the regions of Gamarket. Visually I really like the art design, but I understand some people will find it abhorrent, but those people will most likely not even read this, so yeah. That said, some of the characters are pretty much half naked, and even though I have no problem with that, I’m sure some people won’t find it appealing. The conversations are also full of suggestive themes, puns and sexual jokes.\n\nOnce you unlock the Lastation city screen, you’ll be able to do tons of stuff here including, selling, buying and crafting items, you can also talk to various different characters, take on missions or go and talk to Noire on her room. On Noire’s room, there is also some sort of dating/visual novel aspect in the form of customizing her room and answering to requests of the citizens with her, which will eventually unlock some extra scenes. Still, if you don’t want any of that you can completely ignore it. If you go to your Mission HQ, you can play new missions and simulations. Simulations consist on replaying old missions to get more rewards. You can also choose if you want to go straight for the main story missions or take on some side missions which, despite not providing any sort of story, they still give you some nice rewards.\n\nAs for the RPG side of the game, it comes in different ways such as customizing your characters with many different weapons and pieces of equipment and loot that you get either by killing enemies or completing missions. The combat is presented in a chibi art style, which contrasts with the visual design of the rest of the game and I find it be rather lovely. Combat itself is turn-based, which means that in each turn your characters can move and attack once, and movement is grid based. Still, you can move before or after performing an offensive action. When choosing an enemy to attack, you’ll be able to see how much damage you’ll do and its accuracy, as well as the enemy’s counter rate and expected damage. By killing enemies you’ll get loot and experience points which will allow you to level up your characters. Combat also rewards you for placing units next to each other when using special abilities, by improving the relationship between the two characters and granting you points to use more powerful skills.\n\nInitially you’ll only control one character, the main protagonist - Noire (Black Heart), but soon enough more will join your cause. Even though I enjoy a lot games with turn-based combat, I do think that this is one of the weakest points of the game, albeit still a good one. Combat can get somewhat repetitive, especially if you plan on playing every single mission and simulation more than once. Some of the levels in which you fight offer some variety such as traps like electrified fences and floor plates, or the addition of height/verticality.\n\nFinal Verdict:Tons of customization\nLovely visual design\nCatchy soundtrack - even though I don’t understand the lyrics\nRobust turn-based combat system\nStoryline is a mixed bag - it might feel generic to some but I like it and find it rather interesting\nFunny dialogue, albeit somewhat cringe at times\nFramerate capped at 28Hyperdevotion Noire lets you experience a visually appealing, charming and funny story that takes place in a ”gamer friendly world”. It has a pretty solid combat system that offers some replay value with different combinations and because of that, I recommend this game to both fans of visual novels and SRPGs. Needless to say that it this is must check for fans of the Neptunia series.","April 26","true","9.5"," 26 of 46 people (57%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","57","26","46","3","0"

Wait for patches, this is too unstable.\n\nSystem: Windows 7 pro 64 bit.\n\nAdditionally with DLC hell. They decided to sell us all DLC extra this time. But it seems, that this are mostly "hats".\n\nLocked to 30 fps. But this isn't really an issue, because it's a tactical JRPG. So it doesn't matter much. This is one of the games, that does not need more than 30 fps.\n\nThe player character idea is just terrible, Like the "strategist" in fire emblem, who is never visible on the battlefield. And I don't like the conversations around him very much. It feels forced.\n\nI'll change my review, if they fix the crashes.\n\nOtherwise this is a game with Noire as main character. What is not to like about that. ;) I am not able to say more about the game, after the short time I played so far. but I will insert the positive aspects here, too, after a time.\n\n\n----------------------\n\nAs  said before, my main issue are the CTD. That is unforgiving. With the other aspects I am able to live.\n\nI week has gone by, no message from the developers. I will ask for a refund, buying the game later, if fixed, for 5 Euro in a sale.","April 29","false","1.8"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","1"

It's a turn based HDN game and you get what you pay for. Take it now while it's on sale (till May 3rd) or regret it until the summer sale and then forget about it until the day after the summer sale.

Thus forcing the question of if buying this game really gives that many shares to Lady Black Heart at all? I mean Iffy and Compa are clearly citizens of Planeptune....\n\nNow, I'm sure Proper worshippers of Lady Black Heart have already played this game through more than once on their Unis, but some people probably haven't. Let's take a look at what we got going on here.\n\nWelcome to Gamarket, another dimension in the Vast expanses of the Neptunia Multiverse. Here, Noire is pretty much in charge and controls most of the shares. However, Noire is still Noire and a certain Eggplant looking person made her fall into a trap, that not even Neptune would fall for. All hell has broken loose and the Shares in the world are in shambles, after a little bit of bickering Lady Black Heart takes charge of the other CPUs and sets to regain the shares of the world from her former 12 generals.\n\nJoining the lovely CPUs is Noire's new Secretary. It's apparently a male, but since Males don't get faces in Neptunia we don't actually see him and it seems much of the adventure takes place from his point of view, and he may or may not get closer to his boss as the game goes on.\n\nPros\n+An unpresidented look at Lady Noire as a character, especially for Steam Audiences.\n+ Grid based Tactical battles require a little bit of thought and do make you have to different types of objectives\n+ 3 difficulty modes\n+ Panstu everywhere!\n+ Noire's Generals are all new and represent different game franchises like Metal Gear, Street Fighter, Dragon Quest, ect and are exclusive to this game\n+ The girls kiss to power each other up! The Lilly system is in OVERDRIVE\n\nCons\n-The port is horrendus with a lot of lag spikes for apparently no reason. Those will probably get fixed if I know Iffy though.\n- The CPUs are obviously different then the ones we know, and can be out of character. For example, Noire looking for informality in her employees, or Neptune genuinely getting offended when someone calls her out on her laziness.\n- The Secretary (you) have some lines like "I'll lead the way...

The Self-insert certainly doesn't help. The girls will be spending an almost equal amount of time making love as opposed to making war in battles because the Lilly system is ridiciously OP here. It even allows the use of our favorite EXE Drives! So, if you like the thought of that, then you should have bought this game already. The battle system is fine, nothing groundbreaking, but you'll be disappointed if you expect the greatest gameplay from Lady Neptune.\n\nI notice how much I'm cringing as i'm going through the game, but I'm also laughing too.

LEGION!\nLEGION from CnC: Updating Review Stand by...\n\nYeah! It's everybody favorite Lonely Heart Noire finally became the lead character.\n\nGameplay It fun but can be repetitive somehow, this time is turn-based tactical RPG. If you play Final Fantasy Tactics or XCOM you will feel like at home plus the Noire Simulator minigame. the problem is 30 FPS lock.\n\nStory You start as The Player/Noire's Secretary. Your main mission is to clean up her mess(no spoiler here). Meet Noire's Generals, beat'em up and unite them and say "who the boss now!" then defeat Afroire uhh... Arfoire(again) and save the day(still no spoiler that hag like in all games 3 times already) with fun, 4th breaking, referencing storyline.\n\nGraphic Come on who cares! most of it is VN(with battle). It even has Tsunako art in it if you know Fairy Fencer F and Date A Live Series.\n\nSound After Re;birth Trilogy, still have the same music. Catchy no comment\n\nOverall Noire finally have a friend. (so proud!)\n\n3/5 Because of Gameplay and mostly Story, NO\n4/5 Because of Gameplay and Story + beautiful Tsunako art","April 28","true","7.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","0"

I do like that the Noire dating sim aspect does focus on one girl and your relationship with her, and it's not a harem. In fact, the leader of the harem is Noire, not you. She's the lion, and you are one of the lionesses\nStory is decent. Seriously. Don't play these games for the story, maybe except Rebirth 2 and getting the conquest ending\nNew assets... mostly\nHistoire's mission briefings. I end up really liking them\nI actually have warmed up to the interactions between Player and Noire.\n\n\nThe bad:\n\nReuse: The visual novel areas are reused\nReused music. They really need to compose more. It's not like the Final Fantasy main theme, or the battle victory theme. They overdo it\nNoire doesn't seem to be the protagonist. You are. In the other games, you felt more like you were Neptune or Nepgear. In this game, you are an observer. In fact, you seem to play Player\nKind-of mixed on the Noire dating sim.\nStory is cookie-cutter.\nNo Candidates :( . Even though the Candidates are often minor characters, I do like what they add to the story.\n\nIf you like the other games, you'll probably like this one. I listed more cons than pros, but it's overall a solid game if you aren't encountering bugs","April 27","true","61.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Can't ask for more\n+ Some refreshing Table Turn Based RPG in Neptunia franchise\n+ Quite Challenging if you play with Hard difficulty and without ultimate gear\n+ Some new Refreshing RPG-ish BGMs and RPG-ish places\n+ A lot of characters (that means a lot of grinding)\nCons :\n- 30 fps (honestly It didn't bother me that much)\n- Music not looping properly. Now this is bother me so much\n- Achievement not popping in game (It will popped out after you quit the game)\n- Auto Dialog system  just skip to next dialog if there's no voice. I always play with Auto so this bother me too.\n- Oh yeah, I forgot about the faceless secretary guy. Ugh I don't like him, typical guy\n\nWell, I can't say this is a Great game, but I can say this is a good game (especially when there's Noire in the title).\nIf you enjoy Neptunia franchise and love Noire and don't mind a bit of bug here and there, I recommend this game for you.\nBut if you butthurt about everything wrong with this game, well just do what you want.","May 4","true","45.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The CPU transformations are a unique addition, and I like they added characters based on game franchises instead of companies and consoles.\n\nThe Bad:  The trap floor tiles are really annoying, and don't seem to affect the enemies.

Love main series a lot! Love even slice and dice one. But this one... no. Just no.\n\nMechanically mostly it's fine. It has neat combat, good scenarios for that combat. But weird thing #1 in here is that in order to activate hdd u need to perform skills while standing near other character. That char kisses you and it adds some points into lily. Activating HDD cost 30 and it lasts only 3 turns... this in my opinion is very weird alteration. I'm also replaying Nep-Nep game with my favourite character - Plutia. And considering that activating hdd in there does not sorta... forces you to rush and you can just enjoy your anime-power-up - this change to good 'ol formula in Noire game seems very weird to me.\n\nHowever this is not the main reason why I dropped the game and do not recomment it to Nep-Nep fans. The main reason is how Noire is in the game and what she's doing. This could be somewhat spoilery, but I'll try to cover only her motivation and formulaic approach to stuff. Basically Noire wants to conquer everything. Yeah... Noire is now despot and wants to conquer all and is ready to beat and destroy everything which stands in her way. Formula to events - we see some characters who are powerful and could be good addition to Noire army. Noire just... beats them, adds to her roster, captures country/city and move to next one.\n\nThis... no. Just no. I play in Nep-Nep to enjoy humour, parody, references, colorful cast. And character who was established in like 4 games or so, suddenly wants to conquer everything and acts like a male baby making organ... no. Most of battles I'm seriously cheering for me to fail the combat.","May 4","false","17.9"," 7 of 16 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","7","16","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jesuiscontent/recommended/415480/","jesuiscontent","Jesuiscontent","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jesuiscontent/","233 products in account","The gameplay is just awful.\n-Maps and AI are ♥♥♥♥. No interesting objectives or enemy setups, and getting the few chests isolated in a corner is just needlessly tedious, as you don't have any pressure from anything, the enemies just nicely wait for you to get in their range before they do anything, there's no time limit, no reinforcments, absolutely nothing. You're just wasting you're time going from one part of the map to another with no repercussions to gather the chests. You don't even get any reward or incentive to finish missions faster or by minimizing damage taken or anything.\n-Due to the aforementioned garbage AI, combat is always "bait one enemy by sitting at his max range then gang him up". They do nothing by themselves, and even if you "aggro" one of them their buddies just don't care and they'll wait for you to come to them to act. That is reallty mindboggling coming from Sting. How can you do this sort of ♥♥♥♥ after making Yggdra Union is beyond me.\n-No interesting options. A simple weapon triangle would've been the bare minimum instead of "normal attack, weak skill, strong skill" where you only have to watch for your SP gauge. It really feels like I'm playing a regular RPG, with all the slowness and shortcomings of a TRPG and none of the benefits.\n\nI beat Rebirth 1 and sort of enjoyed it in a mindless, button-mashing and completionism kind of way, and I wouldn't say I recommend it, but this game doesn't even have that aspect and is just way worse.\n\nAnd that's not even touching on the usual rock-bottom production value, but I didn't really have any expectations regarding that after playing Rebirth 1.\n\nI got hard baited into buying this because I saw this was a TRPG made by Sting, but it turns out this is nothing more than a quick cash-grab with none of the parties involved giving a ♥♥♥♥ about this game. Only buy if you like nepshit","May 5","false","4.0"," 2 of 15 people (13%) found this review helpful","13","2","15","0","0"
