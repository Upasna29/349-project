The endless mode is where you keep flying up rescuing people without crashing into static buildings and mountains and moving objects likes rockets, aeroplanes and wind turbines. Oh and make sure you're quick too or the ever encroaching tidal wave will catch up with you.\n\nYou earn cash by rescuing people successfully and get to spend it on new helicopters with different handling characteristics; speed, acceleration and deceleration.\n\nIt is a perfect game to pick up for 10 minutes on a lunch break, and certainly has that one more go addictive nature.","April 3","true","6.3"," 30 of 31 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","30","31","0","5"

Pro-tip: in fact, it's more like a classic River Raid than UGH! or Space Taxi. Pure retro. Totally recommended.\n\nP.S.The competitive vs BOT mode is not that bad actually. I kinda liked it as it kept the game going pretty well and the bot acts silly sometimes so it can even make you laugh - almost like with a real human player. I don't care whether this is as intended or not but far too many developers forget to emulate such behaviour when writing an AIs. Oh, and the BOT crashes himself with shame when you are ahead of him, rescuing the folks faster than he can ^^.","February 27","true","7.7"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","12","14","0","3"

I don't like the fast pace of the game nor the fact that the game put you against a human opponent without even asking. The only way to stop the match is by shutting down the game. Nor was I able to modify the controls or change the difficulty level. When you see the opponent selection screen, again you need to choose fast or you get a human opponent against you. You're also able to get stars and upgrade your helicopter.\n\nThe fun part of the game is rescuing people while maneuvering between mountains and obstacles. But you have to maneuver your helicopter very fast from left to right our you'll crash directly into it. Has a very incremental increase of difficulty level.\n\nA key was kindly provided here:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/fegames#announcements/detail/914598992237397543","February 22","false","3.6"," 20 of 36 people (56%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","56","20","36","2","0"

The controls are simple, but nothing innovative to  them like they claim. Overall there is very little content, 50 levels of which you must do with bots or online/with friends, so the only real single player is the endless mode. The levels themselves are easy enough to 3 star, makiing the achievements relatively easy to get, except for one, which baffles me, you get about 20-30 gold per level complete with 3 stars, I'm not sure the exact scaling for it, but you need about 26000 gold for all the different choppers, which is absurd, I am currently grinidng endless mode to try to get this last acchievement jsut because I would feel weird leaving it unfinished, but the amount of time it's taking for the amount of content in the actual game is ludicrous to say the least. Luckily it's a cheap game, so you won't lose much if you play it outside of some time spent elsewhere. Overall it's a short simple waste of time if you have nothiing better to do, but there is nothing new or innovative here.","March 26","false","6.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

For example, the game goes nuts as soon as I connect my Xbox One controller, so I am forced to use my keyboard to play. Besides, you either play against the computer or another player. So, no proper single player (like the mobile version) and the multiplayer is always competitive: no real co-op; I mean, you cannot co-operate with a friend to pick up the people together, but to do it before the other player does.\n\nI am going to ask for a refund until the game is more polished and a real co-op is added.","February 21","false","0.1"," 23 of 46 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","23","46","2","9"

If you move left/right you gain altitude, if you don't move, you drop altitude. It's a race against the opponent to collect the most tourists and come back to landing zone, played on the split screen – it is slightly annoying that on my half of the screen I can see a shadow of the bot, it uses always the same chopper as the player so sometimes it gets confusing. Over 20 choppers with different stats and 50 maps are available.\n\nIt can offer 2-3 hours of fun.

Takes about an hour to play 50 simple levels.  Then you can just try to get 3-stars on each level, and grind to purchase other helicopters (the default one is fine).  A few problems: (1) The controls are awkward.  You only have right & left which make you go up-right or up-left and it automatically descends in the last direction when not going up & right/left.  You might be able to use down to decelerate down-left/right faster, but is unecessary.  (2) Your star rating seems based in time, which includes your partner, not how many guys you rescued more than the bot, but you still have to rescue more than the bot to proceed, and if the bot takes a while your rating is hurt.  Still, I ended up with 1-3 stars per level on first try, better if the bot crashed because it stops the time immediately if waiting for him.  It is partly cooperative, pertly competitive which is odd.  (3) I don't see any point to buying other helicopters.  It is so wonky as it is that I can't imagine controlling it if it were faster.  It was really ackward at first, but rather OK later.  I was happy to reach level 50 and be done, but wasn't bad by then.\n\nI was hoping it would be similar to Space Taxi (C64), but it plays nothing like it.  I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, but it is tolerable if you really wanted it.","April 3","false","1.7"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"
