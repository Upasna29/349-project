It will self destruct when you are done listening to it. This game is worth your money. Has your good old fashioned 60's style destroy things for the fact that you can villian. Good pun humor, and if you've played any of this companies games in the past before, a warm fuzzy feeling of joy that you can not get from any of the best street drugs money can buy. Do I recommend? I go beyond and demand you get this. Also you should just turn off the tape before it ends....TOO LATE *BOOM*","May 24, 2014","true","3.7"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","11","11","0","0"

There were hundreds of jokes, comic scenarios and conversations which made it (to me at least) one of the most charming games in existence. However, the puns, one-liners and charm of 'Dry Cereal' have been compromised in 'Operation Ozone', instead leaving our titular character awkwardly didactic and explanatory in situations that he would otherwise be comedic and interesting.\n\n"But why the positive review?"\n\nRegardless, this game is exactly the way I remember it in my childhood, and at least in terms of gameplay, it's still an absolute treat to play. The novel gadgets and quirky scenarios are there in abundance (greater so than the first). And playing a second time will reward with with an alternate story, a testament to the care placed into making this game. The art style and music are cohesive and the game world truly is filled with interesting and funny characters; but its always going to be overshadowed by the first game, a comparison which becomes more stark with age.\n\n7/10","June 15, 2014","true","1.8"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

But seriously, the game has great voice acting, amazing animations and graphics, dramatic background music and effect noises to entice all ages and make the scenes better, and enough gameplay (dialogue and games included within) to keep a person occupied for about 3 hours long.\n\nConsidering this is a children's game and over 10 years old, it is more than worth the few pounds on Steam. However, to be fair as a reviewer, although this game in the Spy Fox series is the longest one made, it is likely that you will remember how to solve most of the puzzles after one playthrough. Nonetheless, the major puzzles (i.e. codes on blocks, hairdo's, etc) change with every playthrough, keeping the game interesting once you've completed it once.\n\nOverall, I would highly recommend this game. It'll keep a child interested, mainly through Spy Fox's laughable humour and the interesting puzzling solving, whilst it's dramatic sound effects and plot are detailed enough to keep an adult intrigued as well. Besides, who wouldn't enjoy seeing a humorous fox in a dandy suit ;)","June 19, 2014","true","2.1"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Maybe the sound quality is not very good and the pixelation is pretty awefull (Considering it's age it is okay but I am looking at a standpoint of today compared of games today) but besides that you get some very nice adventures with allot of gags you will still laugh about as long as you like Cartoons and everything. Kids will love this. I also love that it is made for childs the secrets are much easer to puzzle out.\n\nSo all I can say, if you love adventure games you cann still pick it up but let's be honest how many point and click adventures aren't timeless.^^ They all are and this no exception.\n\nAlso best are the quick playtroughs of 2 hours which makes this perfect for people with less time!.","February 16, 2015","true","4.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

This time the game's really easy in comparison, the game lets you visit four locales but each is relatively contained to its own area for the most part, and the four smaller areas feels less interesting than one big area. The humor's still there, the puzzles are still fine and all, and it's still enjoyable, but it feels like there's something missing from this one, I don't know. It doesn't seem to toy with spy tropes as much either, they're just kind of there. They play up how kind of incompetent Spy Fox is more here than the other games, it feels like, I guess. I like this game but I certainly wouldn't take it over the first two, but all three are pretty decent adventure games for kids and I'm a little sad I never played them until now!","July 15, 2015","true","2.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Although it was a point and click adventure game targeted to children, it's still really fun to play as an adult. Even today, the gameplay never ceases to entertain me. The humor is always charming, the puzzles are reasonably challenging to a kid, and the sound design and interaction really polish up the game. Overall this game is definitely suited for everyone as its both fun and educational.

Still a masterpiece.\n\nPros:\n1.Puzzles. The Puzzles for this one can actually get pretty difficult. My favorite one was probably the Chicle Puzzle or the X-Y Donut Ingredients Puzzle. <You'll know what that means if you play it. Puzzles are fun as always. Not too easy not too hard.\n2.Gameplay Mechanics. We still have the ability to interrogate people about things as well as several interesting but absurd gadgets. Overall gameplay plays just as well as the previous two games.\n3.Paths And Endings. As with the two previous installments of the Spy Fox series there are two paths leading to the same ending and a hidden ending. I'll be after that hidden ending soon.\n4.Humor. Although not as good in jokes and puns as the previous installment this game definitly still hits the humor mark just fine. Some of the humor is a bit edgy; like a joke about cops and donuts as well as this psychopath who talks to her sock puppets. I applaud them for their minor risks.\n5.Pocket System. The Pocket System has improved just a smidge. In the previous installment you had the gadgets pocket, the interrogation pocket, and one pocket for each individual item. In Operation Ozone all the items are instead in one singular pocket together.\n6.Spy Car System. This was something I really enjoyed that they added to the game. In previous installments the Spy Car was only used for puzzles but now it is used as an actual vehicle for getting from place to place. It can be used to travel between The Street, The Jungle, The Desert, and The Lake. I thought this was a very nice touch.\n\nCons:\n1.The 5 or 6 minute intro is kind of ♥♥♥♥. I'm not gonna lie, i did not enjoy the short beggining. Too hard to follow and just extremely abnormal. Maybe a bit too abnormal.\n\nStory:\nSo this time we're up against a poodle who dresses and wears makeup like some sort of rich ♥♥♥♥. Her plan is to use the APD to destroy the ozone layer. This will of course cause immediate threat of genocide, so people will have to line up to by her sunscreen; SPF 2001. Of course buisness goes as usual in Spy Corp and we must stop this crazy ♥♥♥♥♥. Through a world of Indiana Jones references, James Bond references, absurd gadgets, strange characters, beauty, and cosmetics we must stop Poodles Galore. Yes that is her name... Poodles Galore.","February 13","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"
