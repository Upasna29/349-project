You choose from 8 levels of difficulty in the form of different coloured belts then dive into as many 30-second levels as you wish. Adventure mode is a last-as-long-as-you-can romp. First off, the game throws you into a very tight arena-type room with little space for manoeuvre and challenges you to clear it in thirty seconds. You get an ominous siren after 20 seconds to signal that an indestructible nasty will soon arrive. The actual challenge from room to room rises well. One death ends the level (in Tally mode) making that 15 seconds delay to get back into the game seem VERY long.\n\n--PRESENTATION & DESIGN--\nProgress is displayed by showing which of the 89 rooms have been cleared and with which coloured belt. The game takes you to this screen every time you finish a room which is a great, at-a-glance progress system. The sound is ambient and tunnel-like. When entering a room you get that echoey industrial sound which adds a suitable edge to the game's atmosphere. Explosions and the deaths of enemies is satisfying especially those that require a number of hits to be dispatched. Rooms are lit with a Tron inspired neon-lighting theme.\n\n--CONCLUSION--\nLike most twin-stick shooters this is not a game you'd normally play for long stretches. However, for a fifteen or twenty minute blast it's a great pick-up-and-play game. There is a bit of back and forth screen hopping when changing difficulty but no biggie.\n\n5/5","November 26, 2013","true","15.4"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","14","14","0","0"

It was a genuine and very real inspiration for me thinking "one day, I want to do something like that" and well, I do now.\n\nIt wasn't just the game, it was that there was this really small team making arcade games at a point where it's generally accepted that the arcade is dead. Well, that's fairly good right?\n\nAnd sure, looks wise even despite a couple of makeovers it looks sort of less inspirational now than it did in the early 2000's and we're in a post Geometry Wars world where everything subscribes to a similar sort of neon-particle explosion sort of thing and I like that, I really really like that but Mutant Storm looks like Mutant Storm and nothing else. It's clearly got Minter-spirations but it's very very "looks like a Pompom game" and that's the kind of thing we can all aspire to. Not necessarily looking like Pompom but making a game that's ours and unmistakably ours too.\n\nThe gameplay seems, now, rather tame considering. It's not easy but there's a rigidity to the waves and patterns that compared to a lot of what we see now is very much more considered. And that's fine, absolutely fine because it still remains a very good little game of shooting things. And what's a game like this if not about shooting things, right? Right.\n\nSo yeah, Mutant Storm. A classic and an inspiration to me. Still, after all these years. An essential, no doubt.","September 24, 2014","true","1.3"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

I've racked up over one hundred hours on the Xbox 360 version of this and it never crashed in any way ever.\n\nThe nature of this game and it's design mean any significant instability is thoroughly ruinous, the score multiplier system and belt progression rely heavily on not dying at all. Perfect play really is key in this game, as such even if the crash was not permanent(until a shutdown and restart) it would still be game breaking...\n\nThis was and always will be one of my favourite twin stick games of all time but not in this broken state. I'm absolutely gutted! Refund request pending....\n\nMy System(for ref) : Win 7 64 Home Premium, i7-4790k 4GHz, MSI NVidia GTX970, 16GB RAM","February 3","false","0.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Featuring 89 levels and two modes; Adventure and Tally.  There's plenty of content and challenge that makes MSR a bargain for the introductory price and a must own for fans of a games like Robotron and Geometry Wars.","March 23, 2012","true","13.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Unfortuantely Pom Pom no longer seems to sell the orignal version except for some iPad remake. In anycase I'd recommend the orignal "Mutant Storm" if you can find it, but would avoid this "Reloaded" version.","February 23, 2014","false","0.1"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/110630/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","Playing Mutant Storm Reloaded is like falling into a nightmare or audio visualizers and 80s sitcom transitions. The abundance of hideous and unnecessary visual effects almost seems intentional to try to hide the uninspired mediocrity of a twin stick shooter hiding underneath. Blurry textures, a nauseous camera, laughable transitional effects between levels, and an overwhelming feeling that the developer lacked any real vision when creating their game make it unpleasant to play just a few levels, let alone "complete" the game by grinding through the seemingly endless supply.\n\nA few ideas, like dynamically raising the difficulty based on your performance, are novel enough, but the implementation is so unclear and arbitrary that none of them can salvage an experience that was doomed from the start. I could forgive the numerous poor choices made with the presentation if the gameplay was at least moderately decent, but unsatisfying shooting, awkward level designs, and frustrating (and boring) enemies did absolutely nothing but remind me of how many other games I could be playing.\n\nTwin stick wave based shooters are a dime a dozen, and Mutant Storm Reloaded ranks among the most prosaic and unquestionably substandard I've played to date.","July 12, 2014","false","0.8"," 9 of 22 people (41%) found this review helpful","41","9","22","0","0"

The graphics are adequate and the music is pretty unremarkable, but it does feature a power up system that keeps the gameplay somewhat interesting.  The game does however seem to have a fairly mundane level design, and lacks the same sort of frenetic arena that Scoregasm offers.  Although the game does have widescreen and Steam Overlay support, the co-op mode is unfortunately local only.  In short, Mutant Storm Reloaded is an average entry into the genre, one that is worth grabbing if you catch it on sale, but otherwise there are better titles in the genre.","March 22, 2012","true","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
