"http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/recommended/316660/","markdj","dj.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/","2975 products in account","I could write the shortest review ever for Toast Time but that wouldn’t do it justice. Not entirely, at least. Because it looks simple doesn’t mean that it is simple. Toast Time is a port of the original iOS/Google Play game and it’s actually very fun (and frustrating) to play, even if you can clearly see its mobile roots.\n\nThe goal in this game is simple: protect the clock from ringing by fending off tons of enemies with your character (who is a slice of toast). You can do this by shooting bread at them and it’s done with the press of a mouse button. Simple. But, there’s something else you have to take into account. By shooting bread you will also thrust yourself into the opposite direction. Call it recoil, call it crazy physics, call it anything you want, but one thing’s for sure: it makes the game damn hard, especially halfway through the game when the levels are designed in a way that you can’t navigate through them properly without carefully planning your shots. It makes for some stressful situations as more and more enemies approach the clock and by missing just one shot you can risk losing the game entirely. Fortunately for us the levels are short and can be finished within several seconds to several minutes, max. Restarting them takes only a few seconds and after that you’re on your way again. ‘Just one more time’ is what you’ll be saying time and time again, because of the way the game (re)loads levels so quickly. Well played, Toast Time. Well played.\nThe clock functions as some sort of base, by the way, and if only one enemy bumps into it you will fail the level. It’s absolutely necessary to protect it. A difficult task, but made easier with your (unlockable) weapons, which brings me to the following point:\nCollecting boxes during your playthrough allows you to unlock a new random weapon (of the collection that you already own) that might make your objective easier. For every x amount of boxes you collect you’ll unlock a new weapon. Some of them are useful, others are, erm, less useful, depending on the situation of course. There are also cosmetic items to unlock like a monocle or a tophat. Funny stuff, but not really needed for a single-player game except to give the character more personality.\n\nGraphically Toast Time uses a retro look. Its graphics reminded me a bit of Meat Boy, or any other game designed by Edward McMillen. The older generation I mean. It’s flashy and there are a lot of things happening at the same time and it’s easy to lose sight of where your character is located because your character, the projectiles, the enemies and even the environmental objects are all white and therefore blend in with each other. It’s very easy to make mistakes because of this and I think it would’ve been a good idea if it differentiated certain things.\nSince the game was originally made with mobile phones in mind the game is also shown as a full screen rectangle (i.e. like the screen of a mobile phone) with borders on the sides that show off a bit of the environment. It works fine and it isn’t annoying or distracting.\nSound wise the game is basic. The music is cheery and up tempo and the sound effects like shooting projectiles or smashing into the ground are satisfying. I don’t think the sound effects could’ve been any better to be honest, even if they are so basic. They just fit the style and nature of the game.\n\nI think that finishing Toast Time will take at least several hours, I’m not sure yet, as I haven’t been able to complete all the levels yet. Some of them are just so frustratingly hard, and a few of them also require a bit of luck. But like I said, it’s fun for short sessions. Don’t play this non-stop. You’ll most likely get bored before you ever even finish the game. Short sessions are the best and I personally think they do the game more justice.\nToast Time is an excellent shoot ‘em up/tower defense/action game with a couple of flaws, but these can be easily overlooked. I, for one, had a very good time with it and I would absolutely recommend it to people who enjoy any or all of the previously mentioned genres.\n\n[Rating: 71/100]","August 26, 2014","true","5.2"," 31 of 36 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","31","36","0","0"

It's obvious its primary platform is mobile phones, since you play in an upright aspect ratio.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dkyde/recommended/316660/","dkyde","[404] Dkyde | The Scatman","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dkyde/","667 products in account","Enter the high-paced, overcaffeinated and nonsensical world of Toast Time as the toast Terry (short for Toast Ejecting Recoil and Reload sYstem) with one, clear mission to complete: Secure your alarm clock and prevent the theft of your breakfast-time from unidentifiable ground- and air enemies by using various bread products such as baguettes, bread pudding or croutons as firearms. Terry shoots plain white toast-slices, but once a box is picked up, his weapon (or, rather, bread product) changes temporarily allowing for a more tactical approach as every weapon is unique and has a unique effect. Alternatively, the player may shoot Terry into the air and slam him to the ground – performing an amazing belly flop. This mechanism is together with the ton of hats and customisations yet another indication that Toast Time indeed is a game made with humour.\n\nThough, the player quickly finds that Terry, as any other toast, is bound by gravity and is essentially unable to move on his own. The player must thus use the energy provided by the projectiles to control Terry as he moves in the opposite direction of the projectiles. This ultimately means that not only does the player need to take out all enemies before they reach the alarm clock, but they also have to aim carefully to ensure Terry remains the correct places to defend from the next group of enemies – something which furthermore drastically increases the game speed due to the increased amount of clicking. Aiming carefully while keeping momentum is moreover crucial in order to rack up a high combo and thus increase your final score and rating.\n\nThe special physics and controls also means that some maps require quite some coordination in order to defend them most efficiently. The player will also find that certain locations combined with specific weapons on several maps are significantly better than others – i.e. sliding on the ground back and forth or staying in a top corner. The aforementioned baguette, for instance, may be shot into the ground and effectively create a temporarily barrier. The various maps are furthermore decently varied with an increasing difficulty level, which means the player will find themselves redoing several of the levels to secure three stars on each.\n\nToast Time does not hide the fact that it’s a ported game – as clearly seen in the screenshots and trailer. And while certain elements in the game (especially the interface) are heavily influenced by this, then the game remains attractive to PC-players as well due to the challenging and unique gameplay throughout more than 50 levels.\n\nWe have seen a large and exponentially growing amount of iOS- and Android-games being ported to other platforms such as Steam throughout the past few years – many with mixed to negative results. The process of re-creating a game to another platform is troublesome as many elements – all from interfaces to controls – needs to be re-evaluated and checked accordingly. Most importantly, and regardless of the ported platform, the game needs to provide entertainment and challenges for longer than the average smartphone app-session of around 13 minutes to both justify the new platform and often increased price. Fortunately this is not impossible, and Toast Time is a brilliant example of how humour, challenging and fast-paced gameplay combined with neat monochromatic graphics can make a successful ported game.\n\nIt is important to stress, however, that the game may be completed in a few hours, but obtaining three stars in all levels and completing the ironman challenge (finish all levels without dying once) takes significantly longer. It appears as if the developer expects players to be done with everything in around six hours based on the achievement unlocked after roughly six hours gameplay. Players looking for a fun and at times hectic game with challenging gameplay and interesting physics will likely enjoy Toast Time.\n\nRead my full review here: http://212fahrenheit.reviews/?p=222","August 27, 2014","true","10.0"," 16 of 20 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","16","20","0","0"

The game itself is really weird. It's based around shooting pieces of bread, and something with coffee (no idea). The central mechanic is the fact that you shoot around as you shoot, altough this only serves to amplify my biggest issue with the game, the fact that is is stupidly frustrating. You accidentally shoot yourself 2 cm the wrong way, and while you're stuck the enemy kills you off because the controls are dodgy. This probably has to do with the fact that all the graphics are 2 colors, white and another color (red, blue, green etc.) this is thematically quite pleasing, but bloody annoying, because your mouse pointer IS ALSO WHITE. So what happens is that you have no idea what you are aiming at because your pointer is invisibru. That is probably explained by the fact that this is a pc port for a mobile game, down to the slider for music being strangely like what you would see on perhaps android.\n\nSo I have harped on about the game enough, is there anything good about it? Well some of the little jokes you get when you die that encourage you to try again made me grin a couple of times. But what is a plus I will defend until the end of time, is the music. Not a direct callback to the "olden days" but a nice retro jam that will keep you amused.\n\nLike playing super crate box on acid, To play with popcorn in your hand on a lazy afternoon, plough through it in a couple of hours, and never think about it again, and you can hold popcorn while playing, you only need a mouse. More enjoyable than Harakiri\n6/10","August 28, 2014","true","1.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

You are a little toaster that must defend a clock from some... lemons? garlic? (i don't know) until the clock discharges its power.\n\nSomething tells me this game is focused to use with a touch pad, but anyway, i did'nt find it very annoying to use with the mose.\n\nThe "8-bit" like music is catchy and changes very often in the game.\n\nFor me, is not worth $5 dolars, but for a $1.25 is worthy to try something diferent. At least 20 minutes of enjoyment.","February 7","true","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The idea is innovative, and very fun to play. This is a game you can play while watching TV or a movie, and not worry about losing, as it doesn't take much of a mind to play.\n\nJust pick it up, and play.\n\n7/10","June 7, 2015","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It looks quite hectic as player invulnerable player character is bouncing around the screen.\n\nBouncing around actually is big part of the challenge. Obiously shooting is means to kill enemies, but it's also is only way to move. So while shooting, it's also important to pay attention where player character is actually going. In later levels it's usually some place that's hard to get out from and somewhere that's doesn't have access to clock that needs to be defended.\n\nLevels have different twists, which keeps gameplay varied. Also there's unlockable guns (or bread, it's Toast Time after all).\n\nBut all in all, Toast Time has best of the retro game qualities, frustrating, but still very addictive. Give it a try.","December 26, 2015","true","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/johnwh/recommended/316660/","johnwh","johnwh","http://steamcommunity.com/id/johnwh/","377 products in account","A greatly underrated little game with amazingly energetic music.\n\nBasically a shooter, you use the mouse to aim at silly little smiling monsters who are trying to break your alarm clock.  Your guy Terry isn't hurt by monsters himself, but wherever he fires, he's flung in the opposite direction.  At first this isn't much of an issue, but it isn't too far in where you're having to choose your shots carefully to stop your heroic slice of toast from getting hurled behind barriers and unable to hit his grinning foes.  Additionally crates fall from the sky; shooting one gives Terry a random powerup from all those unlocked.  Some of these require quite a bit of skill to use, but others fill the screen in a gratifying spray of breakfast ordinance.\n\nAdditionally, each level rates you on the now-traditional three star scale.  Getting that third star in later levels can become a heroic undertaking.  Sometimes it feels as if the third star, on certain levels, requires getting a specific powerup, which is a bit tiring.  Still though, it is a fun little game that's worth a few dollars at least, and has been nearly invisible in terms of promotion.  It's worth a look!","December 27, 2015","true","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
