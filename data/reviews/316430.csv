They've cut the legs off the game to sell to us as DLC. It's analagous to selling someone a car, and then selling them a season pass that includes the rear-view mirror, the trunk door, and the two rear wheels.\n\nOtherwise, the game fails to in any way captre the brutality of the first world war. This is do in part to the failing of the Gem engine to be able to accurately portray this, but nonetheless I expect more to that end from a project of this scale. Trench Warfare was frequently brutal hand to hand combat, but all this seems to depict is lazy potshots at one another from across no mans land. Artillery is frequently so weak it's virtually useless, failing to do any significant damage before the enemy has a chance to bandage themselves. The addition of horses was interesting at a glance, but the soldiers can't do anything from horseback, so attempting to make cavalry charges just results in a lot of dead horses. Hardly spectacular. Gas is rarely used in the campaign, and it's always a cutscene, watching a trenchful of your men just die without any kind of reaction. Nobody puts on the gasmasks that are clearly in their inventory, no body attemtps to run or seek shelther from it. It's like gassing mannequins.\n\nAll in all, a very poor depiction of World War One. Look elsewhere.\n\n","July 21, 2015","false","40.5"," 549 of 599 people (92%) found this review helpful 32 people found this review funny","92","549","599","32","25"

Are you insane? Should not be DLC, I played this game before it was fully released and we had tanks, not to mention, any modder could make some tank missions. Also, selling campaigns for seperate? I'm sorry, but the people who made this game are MUCH smaller than they think they are to be charging such prices for such things, they're not EA or some big company where their cashgrabs often seem not to matter, this can kill small games. The actual game is decent, but it is like a mod for Men of War: Assault Squad. Trouble is, this WAS a mod, however it seems the biggest change they've made is putting much of their content behind paywalls. Shame on the developers of this game. Their game is not worth 20 dollars, plus 7 dollars, plus 10 plus 10. They are stacking DLCs that should be included in a game not worth 30 dollars trying to make it worth 60 or 70.","July 25, 2015","false","26.3"," 375 of 415 people (90%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","90","375","415","10","33"

Well, my eagerness has not been dulled since purchasing and playing this early access ww1 game.\n\nThe gameplay is the typical MoW style, with objectives to be completed in order to progress. The  models and overall graphics are well suited to the era - and should look quite amazing with the rtm version. No performance issues running on a Windows 8.1 laptop (..mine has 4GBRAM /500GB HDD/Intel HD &Radeon 3670m 2GB (Hybrid) graphics with the settings all maxxed out).\n\nThere are many types of units and equipment included in the "ea" release. So far I've played with the Infantry, Artillery, Mounted rifles, a British tank (and yes, they make excellent target practice for the Germans), support troops (ran a telephone line! ...and threw smoke to call in arty). All seems to be well represented and functional.\n\nMissions and factions are limited right now, but more content will be added over time.\n\nThere is a passable tutorial, which is good enough to get you started - and a fairly challenging but enjoyable first mission. There are 8 missions, I think, in the current campaign.\n\nThe ambient sounds are good, although the gun fire does sound a bit "wrong". The voice overs are definately wrong - but funny at the same time. I feel I'm in command of a rag tag company :P\n\nThere are ingame options to select, although I could not get the music to go lower than the tutorial captains voice - so he was hard to hear.\n\nOverall, straight off the digital shelf - this is an awesome effort by the developers  in bringing a ww1 rts to life. It's definately worth adding to the list.. and if you are wondering, it's similar to the CoH mod: The Great War 1918, and of course if you own CoH and/or the Men of War series you know what to expect gameplay and graphics wise.\nNo crashes or glitches have been encountered - after 1.4 hours of gameplay.\n\nReview Update 3.5 hrs playtime: Having played around 3.5 hours now - I have had one crash, after playing a MP match and was in the lobby chatting away. ALT+TAB'd out and when I went to ALT+TAB back in, the game threw an exception. Not a show stopper tho. Just relaunched the game.\n\nReview Update 6.4 hrs playtime: Had a few 2v1/2v2/3v3 multiplayer matches - and all I can say is "wow" . The mp is epic! And very true to the murderous "advance with rifle" ww1, strategies.\n\nIt has to be played to be experienced...\n\nReview Update 13.4 hrs playtime: Having alot of fun in the single player campaign - I have progressed to the 3rd mission (Night before the offensive). It's a stealth mission which brings in quite an interesting element to the game. I've been playing mostly multiplayer - and really enjoying it. I do struggle with the limited squad selection ability, but it does mean a bit more micromanagement - hopefully this gets improved and greater troop numbers are made available to the player. 3v3 is still epic tho!\n\n\n"The tides may turn, only after many souls have fallen."\n\n\n\nEarly Access Score: 8.5/10","December 10, 2014","true","146.2"," 184 of 205 people (90%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","90","184","205","10","10"

As it looks now, no. Unless you want to support the developers, which may or may not help them fix the issues I've encountered below. Don't count on it.\n\nThis is going to be my first serious review ever made, because it is needed.\n\nFirst off, let me explain my experience with the Men of War franchise.\nI was an ex-modder for Men of War, Men of War Vietnam and Men of War Assault Squad as well as the head of the Men of War Fanclub on moddb.com You may know me as craftan99. This is important to note so that you will know how much knowledge I have of how the game engine works and how it's assets is used. I have safely over 1000+ hours on Men of War offline back when It was a retail version. Now, on to the game.\n\nThe developers of this game, "The Great War Team", have claimed that the single player is finished. However, this is not the case. There are several localization issues where items and weapons miss names. The writing of the dialogues are awful and usually the voice acting and subtitles don't match to what they're saying and some dialogue is recorded with a very poor microphone. Also, little is explained as how to accomplish certain objectives without much direction as to what is required to do certain objectives. Some times you need certain items and it's a pain if you've somehow don't have that item because you dropped it somewhere. The game is also very lacking in Sound Assets, or maybe lacking isn't the word to use. I'd say that it has poor quality. Some guns sound very off when it comes to some kind of noise feedback that is in the background. Horses galopping is also a great example at terrible sound. This series is known to have bad voice acting as Men of War's developers had the same issue. However, I don't know if "The Great War Team" was even responsible for the voice acting or if they asked for support from the main developers of the franchise. In any case, it needs to be redone completely. There are tons of people who would volounteer without payment. Websites like behindthevoiceactors.com let's people try out for voice roles. Why they didn't do this, beats me.\n\nThe mission designs aren't the best either, they aren't very consistent and stealth is usually a hard task, but it is possible. However, stealth missions are rather tedious. Speaking of difficulty and missions, I always found the defense missions in the French and Russian campaigns to be extremely easy to complete. I think it's because the waves of enemies where so small that they were easily fended off.\n\nWhen it comes to balancing, the artillery reload speed need to be longer and the infantry sprint endurance bar needs to be longer. Either that or faster recharges on the bar. Artillery HE rounds could also use some balancing to maybe lower the AoE just a bit, I always found the artillery redicioulously overpowered. Even with realism, balancing is needed to make the experience more fun and engaging. Artillery spam is hardly fun. Tanks are perfectly balanced in my opinion and I don't see much needed in the ways of improving that.\n\nThis wasn't much of a review as it is explaining what this game needs to fix. Even if this is in Early Access, these are things that have been overlooked and should be completely redone.\n\nBasically:\n* The Campaign is not finished, even if the developers claim it is.\n* Awful writing.\n* Awfully easy defense missions where the waves are too small.\n* Poor sound assets with bad voiceacting.\n* Some icons have bad artwork.\n* Localization issues.\n* Tedious Stealth Missions.\n* Balancing Issues.\n\nSuggestions:\n* Add realistic color to the mustard gas, yellow.\n* Add more types of gas and apply equally realistic color. (White Cross, Green Cross and Blue Cross.)\n* Add more unit types to Multiplayer. (Bavarian Infantry, French Chasseurs, Canadian Royal Rifles, White Russian Guard)\n* Add Cavalry and the ability to attack with horses.\n* Add better and fresher animations for the infantry.\n\n\n\nAll in all, I've enjoyed the hell out of the game, but I would enjoy it even more if these issues were fixed. I would be so happy if it was.\n\nThank you for your time.","April 10, 2015","false","28.4"," 310 of 384 people (81%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","81","310","384","19","6"

Not after practically reskining a free mod you can download right now for Men of War Assualt Squad, not after being a little of what i think is slavic bias and putting waaay more tone into the Russian Empire Campaign, not getting accents on the ball for a fitting atmosphere, and certianly not after cheating out many buyers for the base game in its pre-release stage under the premise that they would get it in full when its done... just no.\n\nSave your money, and leave these theiving scumbags to know what happens when you turn your back on early stage supporters and to steal their money practically in a gamble for what you hope is a decent campaign with no clear details on its features or just how long and satisfying its going to be... Just stay away from this heap of crap...","October 1, 2015","false","73.9"," 89 of 123 people (72%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","72","89","123","4","6"

The editor is crazy broken, with 25% of the models crashing the game and causing you to loose all progress you made on your map/mission, furthermore they are milking the game for all it's worth, forcing you to pay extra for all campaigns when the game only comes with one short campaign. The 3 campaigns ( 2 of which have a high chance to randomly crash ) are only available when purchased for a total of $26.97, meaning this buggy mess of a MOD (and yes that's all it is) is $46.96. Let's look at other Men of War in comparison.  Men of War Assault Squad 2 is $34.99 for the deluxe edition and includes 5 campaigns, Men of War Assault Squad 1 is $15 for the "Game of the Year Edition" and includes 5 campaigns with and extra 2 missions for each campaign (comes with the DLC) and an extra bonus mission. All of these games are cheaper than this game and a lot better made. Battle of Empires is a mod and expecting there to be better quality when a $47 price tag on it is insane.\n\nSo short answer, no don't buy this game buy one of it's many cheaper cousins.","August 3, 2015","false","46.6"," 47 of 60 people (78%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","78","47","60","3","9"

In fact, it originally started out as a mod for MoE but has quickly shifted to become its own entity. So fanboys can stop reading, add to cart, and start enjoying - you're already sold because gameplay will be very similar and, in fact uses the same game engine. There will be a few slight differences which can be considered improvements although some nostalgic MoE players may disagree.\n\nAs for the rest of you, think World War I combat strategy on a somewhat grand scale. During gameplay players will have a variety of units to command: infantry, artillery, tanks, etc and each have their own individual inventories to allow total customization based on your combat needs. The combat is real-time and the maps are fully interactive. This means that obstacles can be destroyed, used for cover, and manipulated over the course of the battle as well as reflecting the changing landscape of the battlefield due to artillery shells, bombing runs, or even from building make-shift sandbag barricades to be used as cover. The amount of detail put into the units to reflect the time period is admirable and the effort does not go un-noticed. BoE truly feels like a WWI timepiece.\n\nThe game is extremely vanilla in its current Early Access state but still very playable. The developers have 5 different campaigns planned for inclusion into the full release version of the game along with additional bonus missions (possibly DLC?). Currently only the French campaign is included but the Russian campaign is almost completed and the others are currently "in progress." There is already an editor included for the purpose of modding so one can expect a lot of extra community content to be added as well.\n\nThe game also features both co-op and multiplayer as well and both are already working in basic form but I believe more features will be added before completion. For an Early Access game there is a lot of content and playability available and I experienced no bugs or crashes so there is no need to wait.\n\nThere are a few things that I hope to see improved before the final release. The sound and voiceovers are mediocre at best and still leave a lot to be desired. Another issue is with the limitations on squads. While the game consists of large scale combat, it becomes a hindrance moving troops all around the map when you can only control a specific handful at a time. The user interface feels cluttered and unorganized. It gets the job done but overall it just doesn't feel very efficient.\n\nBoE includes a tutorial along with a skirmish mission before actually beginning the campaign in order to familiarize players with the various controls and such. However, at times this tutorial is vague and can be confusing, even more so for a player not familiar with this type of game and a lot of information is stuffed into this small sampling so it can quickly become overwhelming. Hopefully these elements all get ironed out before the game is released as a final product.\n\nThe Good:\n========+  Authentic WWI atmosphere\n+  Challenging strategic gameplay\n+  Large variety of units and customization\n+  Quality graphics\n+  Low CPU usage\n+  Game speed options\n+  Multiplayer and co-op features\n+  Mod friendly w/editting tool included\n+  Rotating camera functions smoothly\n+  Steam Achievements\n+  High replay value\n+  Active development team\n\n\nThe Bad:\n======-  Average sound and sub-par voiceovers\n-  User interface is clunky and needs improvement\n-  Confusing tutorial/steep learning curve\n-  Squad limitations on mouseover\n\nFinal Thoughts:\n===========While Battle of Empires : 1914-1918 is still an "Early Access" game and the price may seem a bit lofty, there is already a lot of quality gaming content included with a lot more already in development. Plus it has an early stage multiplayer feature and comes with an editor for modding. I recommend RTS fans to grab this game now because the price could easily go up once all of the content is added. The gameplay is solid, the content is of good quality, and this game is just as fun and challenging as Men of War.\n\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","March 14, 2015","true","19.8"," 37 of 53 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","37","53","0","0"

Nothing like it I always wished that when I played men of war that there would be a game mode like campaign missions but mutiplayer and both sides have to ability to call in reinforcements its like playing a campaign mission but with inteligent enemys. The premis is simple you either start with attacking or defending while the defender has to prepair defences the attacker has to prepair his attack force then the game starts and you have to invade or defend. The map is massive also and therefore the defenders have an abundance of defences to fall back apon.

In short, I like playing the parts of the game that work. The reason I don't recommend the game is that it still need A LOT of work and the bar seems to be set way too low for parts that are "Completed". A few examples:\n\nHorrible voice acting: There are one or two guys doing all the voices in very bad english. This gives the whole game a feeling of "unprofessionalism" and this element is simply no good.\nBad cut-scenes: In addition to the poor voice acting are bad cut scenes that interupt your fight at the worst possible times. Often, the meaning of these cut scenes are not very clear and they give me the impression that the campaigns are done by an amateur modder and not a professional team.\nUnfinished campaign: The Russian campaign is still pretty seriously bugged, despite the developers statement that:  Originally posted by author:‚ÄúWe have completed the development of the first two campaigns (France and the Russian Empire), and actively test the third."This is a really annoying fact that can ruin the trust you put in a game developer. Realising that the game is still in early access, parts still have to be properly tested before moving on. When it is not, I worry about how well the rest of the game will be developed.\nA step backwards: Compared to "Men of War", this game seems to be a step back. The quality is just not as good, especially with regards to voices & cut scenes, plus the many bugs and lack of finish.\n\nI really hope these things will be fixed and the game will come out on top. If not, it will be yet another terrible display of shoddy game making.","April 12, 2015","false","41.7"," 24 of 33 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","24","33","2","0"

The AI doesn't seem as annoying as in other games based on this engine, but it's still... not stellar.\n- For some, the graphics might not be enough, though they are more than sufficient for me.\n- You can't give commands to more than 8 infantry units at a time. This problem exists with all of the MoW games, but this is the only one in which you give orders to huge masses of infantry on daily basis. And so, it might be a slight problem at times.\n- Minor bugs that will surely be fixed once it's out of Early Access.\n\nIf you've been waiting for a WW1 RTS for a long time, as I did, this is a game for you. It's not a polished AAA gem, but it's a good game nevertheless. Especially when you take into consideration that it is the first commercial project of a small studio. If you're somehow new to the genre(and, given that you're reading this, I doubt that), I would  rather recommend chosing one of the more popular, well-acclaimed games in this genre.","December 25, 2014","true","21.2"," 22 of 32 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","22","32","0","1"

Actual use of trenches?! (Unheard of in most WW1 games, besides Verdun also check that out too!) TANKS?\nSo far this game has everything that a WW1 RTS needs. Besides the community, which is steadily growing since release, (say 12 full games last evening), glad to also see the devs responding on discussions and also having a planned roadmap (unlike most early access reviews).\n\nPros:\nTraditional Men of War gamestyle, "If it aint broke dont fix it" is applied very well here. The engine is well built so no major bugs or game breaking glitches found since the engine has been out for a while.\nWell detail maps and models, From the rivets on the tanks to the boards in the trenches the game is very well detailed to keep you immersed in the WW1 world. Though I can tell there will be graphical updates in the future.\nStill tactical multiplayer, Most of WW1 was mass-infantry charges right after artillery barrages. Which isnt much of a tactic. But with the Men of War engine you have to probe your enemies trenches for weakspots, find out where their arty is before yours (arty is god in WW1), Then when you actually get men into the trenches you have to worry about moving your soldiers through them without getting shot (as much). But still hold true to the WW1 mechanics (still see those glorious infantry charges, and artillery barrages, without losing most of your forces)\n\n\nCons:\nLag, still tends to "come up" with a player who tends to have a computer that says "no", first two games were dropped since the client was lost. But that only happened with people 2000+ miles from me (-5 GMT)\nFirst mission is a bloodbath, almost instantly your men get off the train theres a hailfire of artillery and gunfire coming towards your men, prepare your ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•.\nEditor would be nice! (I can see its coming though so no rush there)\nMore maps! Maybe add steam workshop support? Community Maps? Potential is great here.\n\n\nOther than that the game is great and I reccomend any WW1/RTS buff and all friends to get this!\n8/10","December 12, 2014","true","28.6"," 23 of 35 people (66%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","66","23","35","2","0"

I've been waiting for this game since the day I saw the concept trailer. Essentially I have been waiting for a game like this since I was just a little historian. In the midst of the chaos and carnage of the game I actually found myself pausing or exiting the session because I was so jaw-dropped at how horrific war is; feeling morally uncomfortable with a game (unless naturally we're speaking of "This War of Mine") is a first for me.\n\n\nGraphics are some of the best in the business in my opinion. Contends with, if not better then Men of War. Think Jagged Alliance: Crossfire but extensively smoother then any Jagged Alliance game. When the artillery hits the enemy you're almost always compelled to give a long straught exhale to the poor lads on the recieving end of the shell.\n\nI'm really hoping for a add-on of Canadian troops within British/Commonwealth forces (I see a Russian flag in the game logo as well, I think that speaks for itself). Looking forward to seeing if this game reaches the potential it has.\n\n10/10 recommended to all stratagy wiz's and those wishing to know a little more about the horrific catastrophe known as World War One.\n\nExpect my hours of playing to exceed 200-300 if the developer's keep doing what they're doing.","December 27, 2014","true","11.2"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","13","17","0","0"

The graphics looked nice, the gameplay looked interesting... but when I actually started to play it, I found it was a nightmare.  The game lacks so much in polishing that it feels more like a mod that some new programmer made as his first mod.  The voice acting is atrocious, so bad that it distracts from the game.  Every voice actor has a THICK Russian accent- even the British and French.  They also say things like "FOR THE MOTHERLAND!!" as they storm the enemy trenches.  The objectives are so poorly stated and vague, you can have your men wandering around the entire map for hours until you just happen to walk to a certain spot, or explode something in just the right way for the game to trigger a "cinematic" to move the game along.  If they had polished this game by getting professional voice actors who can free themselves from their native language's accent, actually put the time in to make quality missions with clear objectives, and rid the game of debilitating bugs, then this game would have been worth the buy.

This game is amazing and woth every penny to spend to it! I follow the mod since the early beginning 4 years ago, so I really wanted to get it! So about bugs and glitches:\ncampaign: The only bug I encountered is a sound bug: there is a conversation in the mission in fort waux which says "there must be another route to exit the fort" or such. Well this d√≠alogue somehow bugged and repeated several times not only in that mission, but in the followings also (when I zoomed I could heared it)\neditor: Most of my playtime I spent with the editor and there are several bugs there. First of all about the instantly crash things: all 3 armenian soldiers, the opel tented truck, the grey austro-hungarian helmet and some other items causes the game immediately crash, not even spoke of the things left from men of war, which also causes crash, like helmets, weapons, skins etc.\nso far about bugs.\nsome advice: as a hungarian, I inspected the Austro-Hungarian army to give you some infos about what to change. First of all, the skins are beautiful, but there are some minor problems: austro-hungarian soldiers at that time wore mustaches, so most appropriate would be to do same faces as kaiserj√§gers. It would be nice to add more sounds for them, not only german, but hungarian and a slavic one also. I read that you are planning to add AH to multiplayer, which is a good decision. If I can suggest something, if u think about an elite squad, there should be bosnian troops (like highlander in britain)\nSome other requests: As many others, I would like to have all the campaign and multiplayer maps in editor, I thinks this is not a big deal. I would like to ask about the mustard gas shells, I see there is a damage, called mustard gas, but it did not work, just it is same as a normal explosion. It would be nice to add mustard gas shells to cannons also and explain how it works in editor. I also dont understand, why you removed BAR from the game, it saw minor battles in 1918 so it should be in editor at least. I miss the famous Gotha bomber from german side, If it is not in the singleplayer you should add is to the editor\n\nIf you have any questions about austro-hungarian army or need some help, you can count on me!! ;)\nWish all the bests from Hungary!!

I own every MoW game, including those I wish I hadnt bought like Vietnam and Condemned Heroes.\n\nBattle of Empires 1914-1918 started as a mod and now has gone commercial.\nI think WW1 is a difficult period to tackle with RTS and there are very few for that reason. The MoW engine is perfectly suited to it though and the features of this game such as horses to tow artillery are well implemented. Graphically it is dated but I always find MoW is strong on gameplay and tactics. This game is no exception and I think this is also down to really enjoyable SP campaign.\n\nI have honestly missed the SP campaigns from MOW since Assault Squad focusses on more linear skirmish. It is also enjoyable played Co Op.\n\nHighly recommended even in early access. If you can forgive the voice acting and graphically outdated engine, then this is a top RTS set in WW1 that oozes atmosphere and tactics.\n\n","January 11, 2015","true","5.3"," 14 of 21 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","14","21","2","3"

Really can't wait to see how this game will shape up.  Would be great to see the Ottomans as an added faction and the new Russian campaign.  My major gripe with the game so far is that its difficult for me to detect what's useful in the campaign levels and what's just scenary and cover.  Sometimes there are boxes with ammunition for your troops, and sometimes those boxes are just cover.  You really have to survey all your surroundings to make the most out of your strategy and I wish that the UI made this a little more user friendly.  It'd be great to just press and hold a key to light up all available boxes that you can use so you don't miss anything.\n\nI also really got a kick out of artillery in this game so far but found it perhaps a bit too accurate and too fast with the amount of shots you can keep pumping out.  Awesome how you can link it up to a horse and race it to another section of the fight though, great stuff!\n\nOverall to me this feels like a Total War WWI game that we'll probably never see from SEGA so don't pass it up.","March 18, 2015","true","66.3"," 15 of 23 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","15","23","0","0"

If you want to know the evolution of my thoughts on this game, read my edits, which have been placed at the top, since they are probably more relevant.  If you want a summary: the game is solid but the marketing is atrocious.\n\nEDIT: 10/24/2015\nWhile I continue to stand by my original rating of the game, as it has solid gameplay and is all around excellent missions, I have to edit my statement on the DLC policy of the developers.  When I had talked of the DLC problem in August, the total cost of the game with all DLC put together was about $40.  Today, the total cost of DLC is over $70.  Although you can still get the whole game by dropping $30 on the Complete Single Player campaign and add the DLC Season Pass for another $15, for a cost of $45 total.  That being said, I would not be surprised if coming down the pipe is another set of DLC that will cost another $15 for a limited set of content.  I am incerasingly worried that the developers are following the Payday 2 development model.  Despite their best efforts to market the game as poorly and arogantly as possible, they have built a rather nice game which I hope survives their best efforts to destroy it.\n\nEDIT: 8/5/2015\nAs many of you noticed, the company is trying to milk all that is worth out of this game by excessive DLC.  While this is clearly an attempt to rip you off, it is not nearly as bad as you think.  The DLC is only single player campaigns and does not affect multiplayer.  Given that the purpose should not be the single player, you can get away with purchasing the base game and enjoy the multiplayer.  All you lose out on are some glitchy single player missions.  (To be fair, I thought the voice acting and mission scripting was much better than original MoW and I am very much annoyed that as an Alpha buyer I was not given my money's worth for having dropped $15 on the game. That being said, I stand behind my original review of this game.  Terrible sales techniques do not change the solid gameplay.)\n\nOriginal Review:  From Early Access stage\n\nSure it is basically Men of War set in the First World War, but it is so much better.  It is asthetically improved and the voice acting is comparatively excellent.  Gameplay is a mix of small unit tactics and massive frontal charges where everyone dies, so you don't have to constantly be bothered by traditional MoW micro management.  Historically accurate references abound throughout the missions and the attention to detail makes this a must for anyone who appreciates the history of the war.  The journal entries give meaning to the campaign missions, so you can enjoy the cast of characters that appear through the missions.  The complexity of the missions really gives the player a sense of how much effort the dev team put into the game.  The player is also made aware of how much this dev team cares about their game.\n\nSo in short, its like Men of War but a heck of a lot better because it has a story, it has a dedicated dev team who cares about the quality of the product, and its the First World War.\n\nYou want to talk about multiplayer? Stop asking questions and just charge the machine guns already!\n\n10/10","December 14, 2014","true","23.0"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

Well this game was a eye opener to me. I never heard of a "men of war" before and when i played this i bought the original game just months later. I really love this game. First off this game is SOOOOO detailed its kinda scary. Example: If an artillery shell goes off near a truck and a small peice of shrapnel hits the gas tank, the truck will explode, flip on its side and your men can use the blazed truck as cover. Thats how detailed this game is. It is also very historically accurate and fun to play. Playing the french campaign was a blast. The only bad things with this game is level design for some french mission. For instance i cant pass the fort vaux mission because the AI is too damned advanced to beat. The english voice over is a bit awkward but its definitly understandable since the devs are french and i think russian. So overall i highly recommend giving this a try.

For the moment, only the French campaign has been released though others will follow such as with the German and Russian Empires.\n\nIn Multiplayer you can choose several nations to play with and this in several mod ( such as Control where you have to hold flags to win points, Combat where you simply have to destroy the enemy without perticular objective,...Etc ).\n\nI bought this game day one and must congratulate the devs for a quite smooth release ( at least for me ). There has not been any major bug that ruined my game or broke it.

There are plenty of several units for each nation. Tanks, artillery, machine-guns, colonial troops,...Etc\n-Detailed maps in the campaign.

While the campaign can be a little discerining (IE. Some levels with to many tanks, Stealth mission an simple seek an destroy) Hey, Most people bought the game expexcting Big WW1 battles, Not small skirmishes. Aside from that What makes this game appealing is that many online players are still active, an the game is not to demanding on your PC. Im playing a factory made (Non-gameing PC I got at Staples) an I Promsie this game runs very fine with high graphic setting enabled. I never had a freeze or glitch due to my low grade PC (Even with huge battles). The best part is that when you play online you can have these big battles with others because it doesn't require to much from your pc. All in all I love this game (Even though the chart is confusing as hell with all the "Options" to purchase your game with. I would have to give this game a ...6.5/10...  An for more in depth players The editor is the same as all MOW games an call to arms. So if you are expeirienced with those editors, I HIGHLY RECCOMEND this editor as you can have massive battles Like we all desire (maybe some of you) a downfall to the editor is that you have to make your own maps. Which is a real bummer. But many mission mods will let you play these maps on the editor, Including "SOME" Campaign maps. I'll give the editor an entirley different score.... well not really....   7/10...","May 30","true","12.3"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

They shredded the barded wire I had put up and murdered my machine gunners. My only hope was my last remaining cannon, but it promptly glitched, shot up in the air, landed upside down and killed both the gunners. 10/10\n\nHonestly though, this is the best WW1 game I have ever played. It really feels grindy and slow as trench warfare would feel. It took me 10 minutes to capture my enemys front lines while taking huge casualties in the process, and it was fantastic. The are great and the map destruction is phenomenal. MP is pretty active and works fine. The only gripe I have is the small amount of content at the moment with only 8 (10 counting the tutorial levels) missions. That being said, all the missions are varied and fun. I honestly think this is my favorite game ever. There is an editor so you can make your own levels, and even though it is in early access I havent had any game breaking bugs. The only bad thing about the game is the voiceovers, but in my opinion that is a MoW tradition.

Some pure entertainment in every battle win or lose.

Besides, WWI is a bit more symbolic for Russia/Europe than it is for America, perfectly fitting we cater to an honor of theirs for a change.\n\nI would suggest France campaign first. seems to be a much smoother campaign overall, good mix of maps, challenges.\n\nDoing Russia second, and I found some of the narration timing/lengths frustrating, the story line jumps all over, and there are some quirks (pathing ect) that overall made gameplay illogical in some parts, so save often.

Before that I played mostly CoH and the Great 1918 mod for it. I also played a few of Condemned Heroes not long ago. When I bought the two games I was expecting to play more of Battle of Empires, which I did at first, but I instead enjoy Assault Squad 2 more. It may not be fair to compare the two, but in some cases I will.\n\nFirst of, it is nice to see a world war 1 game. There are not many games that do this theme. I think the French singleplayer does a good job of portraying the war. The missions I played I liked better than Condemned Heroes. However I feel that the multiplayer has a identity problem. It seems without direction. I do not know if it is geared towards competive play or authenticity. Assault Squad 2 strives for competive play, and so we see units of various time periods and even experimental units in the case of Japan. I personally do not like this, but do understand it.\n\nI feel that Battle of Empires fells short on competive play. It seems more casual with the focus on frontlines - assault zones have been added however. Thus I would expect more focus on authenticity. This is personal, but I am not so keen on the mixing around of time periods. Experimental vehicles can especially ruin any authenticity. The Great War 1918 mod did a far better job, it combines historical accuracy and gameplay much better. Compared to Men of War however, Company of Heroes gameplay is something I rather not go back to. When it comes to more realistic gameplay, and so more authentic gameplay, Men of War is much better.\n\nTo who do I recommend this? If you would like to play World War One singleplayer, this game is a good choice. It now has a French campaign, but additional campaigns - British, German and Russian - will be added. It is also a good choice if you want to play online in a World War One setting. For competive play I wouldn't recommend this. If you are looking for an (more) authentic Great War mod you might be a bit dissapointed. The Great War 1918 mod does a much better job at that. In Battle of Empires defense, it is more difficult to portray the whole war than a period of it. And Battle of Empires has Russians, will have Italians in some way and of course picklehaube - which the Great War 1918 mod does not have.\n\nWe must consider however that Battle of Empires is still in development. Overall it is a decent game. I did enjoy the multiplayer games that I played and I did not experience any bugs.\n\nKeep it up Battle of Empires team!","January 2, 2015","true","13.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","1"

For those who doesn't want to read a bit here's the short version: you should buy it IF you like previous Men of war games or similar, only this is of course based in the first world war.\n\nNOW, let's get on with it. As one who is a major fan of the Men of war games and such, this is no exception. i love playing around with the missions, the mission variety is solid enough for me to do so, which is a very good thing considering the format can be tedious sometimes.\n\nLet's get all the negative ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• out of the way:\n\nvoice acting! And general Audio. its not very good. as a musician this hurts more than perhaps it would for others, but here's the thing: most voices for the game sounds like its been recorded in someones basement and not by very competent actors either. most gun sounds are inconsistent, some are fine, others are seriously low, and a few are earbreakingly high, however, the gun sounds in itself are not actually that bad in terms of quality, just a bit of tweaking on the volume would be nice. The music in the game is good, for the most part. there can be parts where it can be very repetative, but i haven't found myself to be particurarly annoyed by it so far.\n\nAnother drawback for the game, is that it uses a bit of old tech (its made of the original men of war back in 2009) which compared to the later games make the graphics and the feel and reaction of the mechanics feel a bit outdated. this is not a huge complaint, but i thought i'd put that out there, in case someone actually reads this.\n\n\ngame content so far, you get a tutorial that is actually not that bad, but it bugged out on me the first time, tried it again and it worked fine. tells you about all the buttons and how the game works in a healthy amount of time. you also get two campaigns (as of the release of this review) you can play as the russians or the french. if the plans to make it five campaigns in the end as it was planned in the mod, then you get a lot of bang for buck! so far i cannot say that the two campaigns alone really make up for the price of the game. they are good, don't get me wrong, but when i tried to imagine myself as a non-biased consumer buying this, sitting down with this and at the end thinking this was worth it? a hard question that i couldn't answer, BUT, that's where the multiplayer comes in! i cannot say a lot about the multiplayer really (since i haven't played a lot of it) but it gives it that extra little to provide you with a couple, if not 10 or 20 hours of fun player vs. player or several ofcourse.\n\ni will probably edit this as i find out i didn't add all i wanted into the review of this, but what i can say and again sorry for people who have not previously played any men of war, but its great, i feel its worth it for the money, the campaigns are again not a huge amount, but they provide for some thinking and not just mindless throwing 1k soldiers in somewhere and hope it turns out alright.\n\ni had a lot of fun with this game and i hope if you are basing your purchase of this review that you too will!\n\nBattle of empires: 1914-1918 gets a final score of mustard gas/10\n","May 3, 2015","true","33.3"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","9","14","0","0"

When i visited the store page I saw a lot of negative reviews I had second thoughts about even getting this game and decided to do some outside research and stuff (cause sometimes the reviews are old or something else). So after watching many videos on youtube and finding out about the little graph showing what you get with what you pay (I guess most of the nega reviews were just from the early stages of this game) and also the last sale I decided to take the risk and buy it mainly because I enjoy games like these.\n\nSo far its been maybe less than a week and I have yet to regret that decision. The single player is a bit challenging Ill admit and sometimes it gets to the point of frustration but I dont really mind. With so many games nowadays basically "spoonfeeding" players, its kind of refreshing to play a game that really challenges you and doesnt quite let you steamroll through it (even on rookie setting it can be a bit hard when you dont take the time to think and strategize) even though there are times I wanted to punch my laptop. As for the multiplayer, Ive only been able to play one game (because im a mac user, please dont judge *sad face*) it was an enjoyable experience for me (mainly because my team mate, who mind you was a fellow noob, cooperated with me and helped out as much as he could) until i ended up crashing out, maybe due to the performance setting on my game but nontheless it was fun and I want to do more of it. There is a bit of a learning curve however but once you get the proper feel of the game and its flow (which im still trying to do) then you yourself can be a badass general of an empire.\n\nA few things annoy me however, such as the Ai of your troops sometimes not acting the way you want them to act, the vague mission descriptions for some missions of single player and the long pauses at times during the cutscenes but these are minor things and dont really ruin the experience of the game. It would be nice though that they would patch out some of these issues but it could be me.\n\nall in all, if youre into strategy games then by all means, do buy this game and the deluxe package as it contains everything from the single player missions to the multiplayer. It is an enjoyable experience and granted the voice acting could be better but then it sort of adds a bit of appeal to the game and its environment.\n\nHopefully they can add cross platform (?)  multiplayer because I would definitely love to play with more people. Its so damn fun and frustrating at the same time.\n\nand if youre a mac user with copy add me up and lets play. Hopefully I wont crash out again haha.","March 23","true","175.9"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","0"

Having played a lot of MoW, AS1 and AS2 over the past 2 years or so I can say quite honestly that if you've enjoyed any of these games you can be quite certain that this game is worth the investment.\n\nSome things which I hope developers will spend time in improving however:\n\n\n- The game could be improved substantially in mirroring AS2's interface. It may seem a trivial point but icons above the heads of vehicles, weapons teams, squads and individual soldiers is invaluable in locating and directing them. In several games while defending in Frontline precious seconds have been lost spent trying to find my howitzer/trench gun/machinegun because they are not as well marked or clearly visible as in AS2. I expect this problem will be rectified soon enough as such icons are intuitively lacking to players of past MoW games.\n\n- The camera moves far too quickly. I expect this can be solved in fiddling with the settings but it's far too jerky and sensitive in default. Micromanaging units can be tricky enough without having the screen dart about owing to one's cursor inadvertently coming into close proximity to the edges of the screen.\n\n- I do not understand why the select and move button are both the left mouse key, as was the case in MoW1. It's wrong. I really, really do not like it. The left button should be for selecting and the right for moving.\n\n- The multiplayer maps need more cover and undulating terrain. They feel rather sparse at the moment, lacking even shell holes or craters to aid the advance of men. Quite often infantry are utterly at the mercy of artillery owing to a distinct lack of cover to shelter behind or hide in. I find myself having to spam infantry in the hopes that only a few will survive long enough to acheive what I wish of them. I do however appreciate the developers are trying to reflect the reality of combat in no man's land, I just wish however it could be done a little more sympathetically to those trying to preserve the lives of their men!\n\nThat's all I can think of at the moment.","January 4, 2015","true","8.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Ill be honest when I first saw the WW1 mods for MOW I was excited thought could they pull this off??? what much else can you do with a bunch of guys with rifles?? with previous expericen int he other games rifles could be the last weapon of choice as they are flimsy in the aim and even worse in direct control, also is there a danger that this could get boring??? But the result from the get go, I was pleasently suprised! Instead of being boring confrontations that drag out there is a level of intesity that keeps you on your toes from the moment the opening camera shot begins to the end of the mission. This games mission design appears in my opinion better than the Assult sqaud style of gameplay. Which was good but lacked suffcient storyline and character. However with Battle of empires, there is a sense of value in the units (that i didnt get with MOWAS 1&2) and a story that builds for great gameplay. This game takes you back to the rpg strategy and it pays homage to the original MOW and red tide series which (ok sketching ai at times) had very well produced missions models and stories with clever twists that made you play on. I get that with 1914-1918 I just feel that same structure. It creates intensity that reflects that First World War in a respectful and original fashion. Why is the game so good?? Your units are vital and if you dont act quickly YOU LOSE ;). Example the fact that Constantly at any point your whole squad can be wiped out by a single artillery shell or the new shrapnal bursts. And those are enough to make even the most seasoned MOW vets tremble in their boots ;) It makes for a truly emersive ww1 experince true to history chronologically and details from the weapons to the hopeless endever of trench warfare. Sure the game is dodgy on some ai and skin colours but with improvement your looking at a rival to the original MOW and FOW.\nMy advice\nIf your a fan of MOW, FACES OF WAR OR RED TIDE?\nYOU NEED TO ADD THIS TO YOUR COLLECTION ;)\nStep into the trenches and feel the shrapnal burst above your head I dare you ;)","January 7, 2015","true","36.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Battle Of Empires is difficult and makes you think. You can not just spam tanks or infantry, you have to use a combination of them wisely. Tanks are powerful, but slow and easily get wiped out by artilery, while infantry easily gets cut down, but if used correcly can take out artillery positions. I played the whole French Campaign and i must give it a 9/10, because it is in alpha and there are still a few bugs and glitches. There was a glitch where a German machine gun kept mowing down my infatry. even though there were no soldiers manning it. Sometimes Mortar crews have a hard time moving the mortar to a new position. Lastly, on some missions some scripted parts wont happen. On the mission Miracle Of the Marne, on my second playthrough of the mission, the taxis did not come with the reinforcements. These problems can easily be fixed, and i look foward to the future campaigns. I feel the problem with MoW is that tanks are used so much, and i often feel i am playing a tank game. However the Great War setting fixes that.\nSide Note: it comes with an Edit mode, which is a reason to buy the game on its own. It allows you to create your own maps, missions, and battles.","February 2, 2015","true","42.4"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

This has been a key feature in Strategy games since the 1979. And on top of that the campaign hasno replayability. And to tell me to buy the "whole" game is ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•. since in total the "whole" cost of the game is around 80 freaking dollars.

I think the Great War is a section of history that has been passed up quite a bit, and an RTS looked like the perfect way to do this.\n\nThis game doesn't do a very good job.\n\nNot counting the fact that literally half of the game is DLC, Battle of Empires does not present a good portrayal of the Great War.  It feels too clean, and nothing feels like it has any impact.  Artillery is weak, compared to the absolutely devastating thing it actually was.  Machine guns have trouble cutting down the swaths of soldiers that come at them.  It doesn't feel like the First World War.  And gameplay wise, it's pretty boring.  It's pretty much exactly Men of War, just in WWI.\n\nAlso the voice acting is absolutely horrendous.  You couldn't find anyone to give a half-decent impression of a Russian soldier?\n\nI guess I'll have to wait for another WWI RTS to show up and see if it piques my interest without disappointing me like this one.","December 23, 2015","false","0.7"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","64","7","11","2","0"

The current French and Russian campaigns are very detailed and interesting, spanning the early weeks of 1914 all the way to the final offensives of the war. The mission variety is very good, with the classic Men of War stealth missions, defense missions in all kinds of terrain where you have to frantically patch holes in you lines after devestating artillery, large scale offensives involving hundres of men on the map at a single time, and even unique missions where you forrage for food and supplies while dodging germans to guiding french airmen in their escape from a German prison fortress.\n\nAs you play the game you will find yourself naturally evolving to WW1 tactics just as the officers of the time did. Initially you will see yourself using your 16 man squads to fulfill objectives in mass attacks that wreak horrendous casualties (2000 men died in one mission, and only one corner of a building in a town remained standing) but later slowly adapt to infiltration tactics by smaller units.\n\nThe game adds a lot of flavor in addition to the obvious unit design changes (which are fantastic and historically accurate). You can tell the developers truly love this era in time, as each mission is fleshed out with neat things like horse drawn artillery and sleds, units that change appearance as the war progresses (pickelhaubes to stalhelms, etc)\n\nMy hours don't reflect my true playtime since I have launched it outside of steam more often than I have from the steam client. Over my entire playtime I can honestly say that the only negative points I can honestly point out would be due to the limitations the Men of War engine (sometimes the UI is tough to use in massive battles on the highest difficulty) and some still evolving issues with multiplayer. Fortunately the devs are very attentive and care deeply about their game so I am sure these issues will be fixed. Multiplayer also suffers from a moderately low player count from the US/Europe.\n\nAnother flaw is the campaigns are pretty much all purchased separately, which is a tad ridiculous but you can always make your own I suppose.\n\nOverall 7/10, pretty good but could be improved.","April 14, 2015","true","17.3"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

So far I've done the basic training and the first couple of missions in the Russian Campaign. I think I've only just scratched the surface of what the game has to offer.\n\nI've seen a bunch of people complaining about the DLC which is a shame because the Devs have split the game up nicely for those who only want the Multiplayer part of it which I think is pretty neat. The base game is more than enough to say it's money well spent so for me DLC just means more hours of fun so when the next campaign is released I'll be getting the season pass for sure.\n\nI'd really like to see more games set in WWI and Battle of Empires shows that if it's done right it can work really well.","July 24, 2015","true","16.8"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","0"

(you can control everybody-a single trooper, yes you can play as him, move around and shoo with him, reload his weapon crouch,lay down throw grenade, attack with melee weapons) (you can also control tanks, artillery, trucks, cars...)\n-realistic maps (perfectly made positions, hills, towns and rivers\n-long and hard campaign\n-useful tutorials\n-EDITOR-(amazing editor, with it you can create your own missions or remake historical battles of your country or anything else)\n-a lot of different opions(like for a soldier, you can command to:throw a grenade,reload his weapon,see inventory,lay down,crouch, stand up,swich to another weapon, swich to melee weapon,take cover,return/no fire/fire at will and many many many others)\n-fast motion/slow motion which is perfect not to waste time when bombarding a place or moving tanks which are really slow\nBad things\n-3,5/10 voice acting\n-stupid AI (many times in missions you have an allied army which supports you and it's strategy is always frontal rush without any strategy and if you task is to help them and they have to survive, it makes it almost impossible)\n-a few very stupid missions (one of these missions is to play as a capruted pilot in a german prison, take your friend and escape. This sounds extremly cool, but when the game is reallistic it's not, your men die 1 shot 1 kill and i have like 100 tries on that missions. I really raged then, and after you survive the prison you spawn in the middle of a battlefield with 2 men, facing the entire german army in trenches and bunkers which are fighting your guys kilometers away and your task is to get there without being killed whic is absolutely impossible.)\nThese bad things are nothing when we talk about the good and amazing things I found in that amazing game that I would call the best and the most realistic strategy game ever!","January 2","true","87.0"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","8","14","0","0"

The early stage of mobile warfare is also well simulated with the other modes (capture points, free fight etc.) where outmaneuvering your opponent is essential to win the battle.\n\nAll the four factions (French, Russian, British and German Empires) are well balanced and plays different.

Anyway, got the game and started playing. Now well go over the nit picks and the BAD:--- (Mind you i know this game is a work in progress so hopfully most of the things will be addressed, im hoping for updating and work on the game, its amazing.) So nitpicking quick, voice acting, boo but not a big deal, little bit buggy sometimes, caracters getting stuck or glitching, and there is NO SKRIMISH MODE, i must say i demand a skrimsh mode, the only multiplayer game i have been able to get into, was a trench domination battle, i got my ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• handed to me, but it was the funnest rts i have played in a long time. Getting off subject, but thats pretty much it.\nI could go on and on about the GOOD---- the depth of the stratagy aspect is amazing, realistic down to every damn character you controll having and invintory, a bit overwhelming at first i will admit, but god this is what i have been looking for in a rts and this game, in my opinion, is setting the way, i demand more work on the developers part on this game and i want to see this game kick off, willing to donate even.

What I thought would be an interesting RTS turned out to be little more than an expensive mod for AS2. I have three main problems with this game:\n\n1) The campaign, which is 95% of the reason I bought this game since multiplayer is terrible and there isnt a 'fight against AI' option is terrible for the amount you pay. The levels are poorly done and very often what should be interesting and exciting campaigns become repetitive and dull. Some battles, like the Marne in the French campaign are great, but seriously who wants to spend two missions helping a handful of Russian officers evade small patrols of Germans and *spoiler alert* spend a mission hiding a flag? Where is the Battle of Tannenberg? Stalluponen? The Battles of the Masurian Lakes? A lot of missions are poorly scripted too, voices don't kick in when they're supposed to or cutscenes activate when they shouldn't- a good example of this was in the Ivangorod mission where in the middle of a fierce firefight the game loaded a cutscene out of the blue. This cutscene involved several soldiers being attacked and shot down by germans whilst they continued to have a calm conversation about what they'll do when the war ends.\n\n2) The voice acting is terrible. And I mean terrible. When I bought this game the French soldiers had a strong Eastern European accent, which I could forgive because it was early days and they'd obviously patch it later.  Which they did, to my horror. When I next loaded the game, their accents had been replaced by British ones- trust me when you hear soldiers using french slang in thick london accents you can't help but laugh. The voices are as awful as the unit animations. The Russian accents are pretty good, but thats all the praise I have.\n\n3) The DLC is getting out of control. I payed for the early-access with the promise of German and British campaigns, as well as the ones that came with it. And once again I got shafted. Do they seriously expect me to pay a tenner to get what they offered me when I payed for this game? Ten pounds for two more campaigns of bad accents, dull missions and more inevitable soul-crushing frustration at what I've become by buying their ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• DLC. Seriously this has to stop- it's like paying for a sandwich to be told that the fillings will cost you the same price again. If they hadn't demanded more money via DLC, I could have even forgiven some of the other faults.\n\ntl;dr Poor scripting, bad cutscenes, doesn't bring anything new, poor animations, overpriced DLC, don't waste your money","December 19, 2015","false","48.0"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","57","4","7","3","0"

The reviews however made me second guess buying anymore than the multiplayer.  However, the sale price was really good so I sprang for the $15 bucks or whatever it was for the deluxe package.  Honestly, when the game does have the big battles (and when they actually trigger and work) it is quite fun.  However, many of the missions are stealth based requiring a good deal of time taking your time.  So you spend 20-30 minutes completing the mission only to realize that the ending (or any other trigger point) is glitched and you can't actually finish...So you can't reload the same mission because it's glitched.  So you start that campaign section over again.  Oh BUT you were on the second of three parts and you can ONLY start back at the first section...I haven't been able to complete about a third of the Russian campaigns due to this.\n\nThe voice acting is ABYSMAL and the conversations and cut scenes are so infuriatingly slow, I'm talking 10 second delays between responses.  The multiplayer is fun, when you can actually get a game going.  Usually a decent amount of people in the lobby but they are never joining games or are playing some mods (usually modern war mods...)  Oh but don't even think of attempting co-op missions with someone as they are even more glitched than the single player versions and I'm pretty sure a bunch of the sections of the missions are cut out...\n\nHonestly, just buy the multiplayer and mess around with it for a while.  It's pretty fun just launching waves at your friends, but it's certainly not worth the $40 asking price for a deluxe version.  It's not even close to being as polished as a $40 game should be.","January 8","false","53.3"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","57","4","7","2","1"

I honestly don't know what to say, or where to start.\n\nThis game was doomed from the start. Really. You pulled an EA, and made us pay for a mod, yes, a mod. Cheers to you all for competing with the mods from AS:2 (Which are basicly this but for free, if you have AS:2) but slapping a big 'ol "PAY US YOUR MONEY" for the game. Alright, thats understandable. You need money to pay it, so we bought it.\n\nSo I bought your game. Turns out, the game actually was not mine, in fact I did not buy a game. What I did was basicly buy a broken car that had it's engine ripped out and tires replaced with cubes, and the frame smashed by a 40 ton tank. Then the dealer tells you that you need to give him MORE money for him to fix it, but once you do that he wants to tax you for extra, and then rips out half of that car for himself, and you need to buy THAT part now. Needs a lot of work on it doesnt it?\n\nThats basicly this game. You buy a half finished game, the developers pull out CORE parts of it. Campaign? Nope, pay us money. If you don't buy the season pass (35 bucks I think) you end up paying EIGHT DOLLARS FOR EACH Campaign. That doesnt sound bad, but what about the multiplayer? HAHAHHA- No. In fact, recently they TOOK OUT TANKS (Which were previously FREE) and now you have to pay for THEM TO (Which I am pretty sure has to break a steam rule somewhere)\n\nSo all in all, why do I not reccomend this game? The Developers have gotten EXTREMELY greedy, to the point where they pull out CORE parts of the game and make you pay yet MORE money to get what SHOULD HAVE BEEN IN THE GAME to start with. I would not be suprised if they eventually made us pay money to play as factions in multiplayer, or use special units. Basicly, they pulled an EA.\n\nAnd don't get me started with the content you do get for all of that money (Sadly I learned the hard way) You basicly can expect bland combat with linear missions. The multiplayer is HILLARIOUSLY unbalanced and buggy. Gas is almost never used, artillery is laughably useless and expensive, and infantry are aparently as blind as a bat without ears (They cant shoot 5 feet in front of them) which end up being one shotted by a tank across the map, which you can ONLY counter by other tanks (Which is a basicly a big "‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• YOU" to the russian faction")","December 18, 2015","false","10.4"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","56","5","9","2","1"

You will be familiar with the interface and the control system it is almost exactly the same. The units and vehicles, in my opinion need a little bit of work as do the maps.\n\nHowever that aside it is still perfectly playable and superbly stable in MP (no OOS errors). I have only played 4 of the campaign with mates so far and we had a blast. Some of the maps really seemed to tax my system (large infantry charges etc so I think the game needs a bit of optimisation as I wasn't running it with all the shiny bits on full. Although my rig is coming up to 4 years old the components are of a high end quality and I can still play a lot of premium titles with high to ultra settings (mainly textures etc) with decent steady frames.\n\nI got a little bored of this quite quickly though and I think that is down to the final polish of the game. Plus I do jump from game to game and have a flavour of the week then jump back to games. There are errors within the game which where quite obvious. But not game breaking. The devs are very responsive to the discussions forum and are keen to respond to your queries and suggestions.\n\nI would recommend this game as it really is refreshing to see a WWI title as opposed to the very obvious WWII stuff. I'm not 100% how historically accurate the game is, it depends if that is your bag or not. I would recommend it if you are in the market for a fun RTS with a different slot in history.","September 9, 2015","true","8.1"," 14 of 27 people (52%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","52","14","27","2","0"

I think even a sort of "Wave Attack" game mode on the trenches vs A.I would be wonderful. The campaign is in short, awful.. alot of people are going to be annoyed by me saying that but it's simply the truth.

As of the time of writing this, only the French campaign is there with the tank and russian ones in the works. Has multiplayer but no skirmish, which stinks because multiplayer is the only real way to use the units you want.  The campaign feels like you are learning new things the whole time so you never get the feeling of really being able to use everything, but other than that the campaign is rather fun.\n\n+Fun campaign (The last mission is the best in my opinion - it has a field combat and ccity combat with a large variety of units and different situations)\n+Cool units\n+NIce looking graphics\n+Comes with two more campaigns being released in future\n+Possibility for Skirmish\n+Nice playing a WW1 game\n+Pretty accurate uniforms\n+Fair price\n+Some tanks that I never really knew about (The french ones that look like boxes)\n+I like how tactics played a big part in the game (The last mission near the end was the best example of this - timing was everythings)\n\n-No Skirmish\n-Bugs (But it is early release)\n-Campaign is a litte short\n-No skirmish\n-German campaign is a pay for one; I would much rather have German than Russian campaign\n-No skirmish\n-Terrible voice acting\n-No skirmish\n-The units have some wierd pathfinding (The french tanks tried to cross the river, not the big bridge right infront of them. Guess its their Frenchness)\n-Please add skirmish eventually.\n\nOverall: 7.5 to 8 out of 10. I dont regret buying it and look forward to the new campaigns (Both the free Russian and Tank ones and the german pay-for one).\n\n- No trading cards but thats not really important, like I rather them work on the game (Skirmish for God's sake)","December 25, 2014","true","31.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Its fun but has a few bugs. One that is really anoying is when a shell comes in an hits near your men they drop there rifles and don't pick them up atomaticly. most of them do but sum you need to tell them to pick up there guns. sometimes there unable to pick there guns up and you have guys who are useless. Controls could be better. I wish mouse controls were like men of war 2. The campaign is fun, im on mission 4 of the french one. Its has stealth, defence and attack missions. The missions donot feel like the same thing. Online is fun when you get into a game. More people need to get this game its fun. A 6/10 at the moment.

For the first 10 hours, I overlooked the atorocious voice acting and the incredibly monotonous music which lacked emotion, out of the sheer excitement this game brought me. Not many First World War games out there, especially which let you experience the Galician campaigns of 1914/1915 and the early war engagements when the conflict still had impetus.\nAfter the excitement wore off I started questioning for what good reason I paid ¬£18.99 for this game. I got two campaigns from the side of the entente, while I'm ardently waiting to lead the KuK forces against the Russians, and also hopefully the German armed forces into single player missions, the editor makes this possible. I hope the community to save me on this one.\nI understand this is still in its infancy stage, but the general artistic decisions are very dissapointing. The music should completent the atmposhere. It should exacerbate the horrors of mechanised warfare. Yet what I received is something unequivocally not suited to the game. I would easily forgive the bad voice acting, and those god awful stealth segments, if the time period was treated with more respect. I currently see too much focus on tank warfare. For something which came in late war, I would prefer to see more focus on infantry warfare. More fluidity when it comes to trench warfare and to inspire more dynamic engagement would make this game stand out for me.\nI came back to MOWAS recently just to see how much did it change compared to BoE and its generally a far more fluid and enjoyment filled experience.\nEven if I absolutely adore the period, and the remarkable battles which this video game brings to life, I simply cannot reccomend this in its current state.","June 13, 2015","false","17.8"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

Not to mention that any melee attack while driving a car disguised as a horse is not possible in Assault Squad engine.\n- They did only Russian and French campaigns and British and German campaign will be paid DLC.\n- Script and voice acting is terrible.

It plays very similar to Men at War, so if you have played it before, you should be able to slid right into the gameplay.\n\nThe controls aren't the most intuitive, so there is a steeper learning curve with the button control. But once you get comfortable with them, you are able to enjoy the richness of the game.","February 23, 2015","true","2.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I am an early access supporter, where the hell is my DLC? in fact why dont we check the store page on the DLC to make sure that this is not some sort of mistake.\n\nNope, not a mistake, want to know what makes this worse? apparently my loyalty, and anyones who bought it prior to April 22nd is only worth a 15% discount. AKA: 75p.\n\nFor the love of all that be holy do not support these devs. I am sick of being positive and giving them chances to impress me and make me think they were worth my support. DO NOT BUY THIS.\n\nEdit #5 or something, i have stopped caring. I originally had concerns the developers would be incompetant, or otherwise untrustworthy. As much as i hate being right, i appear to be right.\n\nEdit #6 or whatever: the devs have censored my criticism. Need any other reasons not to give them your money?\n\nEdit who gives a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•: i have been banned from the forums for no good reason, i offered crticism and simply told someone not to buy the game if their ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing ludicrous DLC plan makes them uncomfortable. Was this bad? probably. Does this excuse them? not really, considering that they didnt even give a reason.\n\nI am utterly disgusted with these "developers" and i urge everyone who reads this to NOT SUPPORT THEM.\n\nEdit whatever again: They have been incredibly unhelpful in my refund requests, i strongly advise and encourage everyone to get a refund and to not support this game any longer, it is NOT worth the time or effort.\n\nAdditional edit: the devs are just plain rude towards ANYONE who does not "understand" their plan. To be clear, their plan is to cut the game up to what amounts to basically ribbons, and then sell you each ribbon for pretty much twice its actual value. Does that sound fair? No? Dont buy it.","January 29, 2015","false","8.3"," 14 of 30 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","14","30","0","17"

I live again!","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CucklandUberAll/","149 products in account","This is my review of Battle of Empires : 1914-1918. The team who made it is composed of ukrainian-russian developers, and i have no clue on how they are not killing or annexing each others office spaces. Now i will go into the elements of the game.\n\nAbout the game: The game is about World War One where you can command armies of the great powers that fought in it. The game is heavily focused on realism and authencity to the great war, thus you can find many information on the theme. The developers have worked hard on it, thus i would give them my thanks for their hard work.\n\nGraphics: The graphics are more of on the level of CoH 1. They are well done and the models are well-designed. and executed done. During the game i experience no problems with stuttering or FPS drops. (I run GTX 770).\n\nVoice-acting: The voice-acting is very horrible and the french accents sounds like an WW2 American Soldier from Call of Duty: World at War. The Voice-acter have problems pronouncing even basic words like Europe (err-rope). The voices also sound very bland as the voice-acter did not put very much effort into it. I am hoping for a new update to remake the voices with more quality.\n\nSettings: The Graphics settings are very lackluster, it contains basics like texture details, antisotropic filtering, shadows and effects and some other effect options which can go from low to high, or just check the box whenever you want them enable or not. However you can still configure the settings to what you want without probably needing more options. The game supports 1024:768 and up to 1920:1080 resolution which i find good.\n\nThe audio settings were more complicated for me, and i did not alter them to much. For me they had a speaker configuration and the more unknown to me, something called mixing rate. I don't know what that is so i refrained from changing it.\n\nThe rest are controls, game and something called packages which has the game campaigns and assets so i would advise to not hamper with them if you want to run the game.\n\nCurrently the game contains 3 campaigns, Tutorial, Russian Empire and France. The objectives are often not explained to much and the killing voice-acting makes it hard to understand. The Missions are presented first by a cutscene that rotates the camera into an angle you find yourself unconfortable with (IT DOSEN'T REVERT BACK UNLESS YOU FIND THE CONTROLS NOT EXPLAINED IN THE TUTORIAL). *SPOILER ALERT* I am still stuck on the first level of the Russian Empire because of the lack of explaination other than to avoid enemy patrols and to cut a barbed wire. Did i forget to mention you are outnumbered and outgunned?\n\nThe subtitles and voice are very different and may have two different sentences, but they often mean the same.\n\nLanguage support: It support Ukrainian and russian, both are well done because of the teams nationality. French and english.\n\nOverrall the game still lacks in singleplayer and voice-acting and some other places, and probably needs better tutorial. It has potential to be something big.\n\nI rate it 4.2/6","April 28, 2015","false","6.5"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","40","4","10","5","1"

So here goes. I'll start with the good things first, then moving on to the bad.\n\n-The voice acting is absolutely superb. From what I understand they used actors who were actually members of the nationalities they were speaking as. Each mission introduction gives deep insight onto what you're supposed to be doing and you can very easily find yourself getting sucked in by the authenticity of the mission briefing.\n-There are always multiplayer games available. I've never had to wait an hour in the lobby without finding a game.\n-The graphics are absolutely amazing. I'm running it through a GTX 770 and it can make my computer choke like a dog on the max settings.\n\nNow for the bad.\n-The game has no strategy to it. The factions are totally unbalanced and some weapons are way too overpowered. You can basically just spam infantry because machine guns won't cut them down.\n-The historical accuracy is way off. The weapons aren't correct for the period and you don't get any kind of historical background on why or how they were used.\n-The campaign sucks. The missions are boring and repetitive. No variety really.\n-The developers have basicaly abandoned the game, they haven't supported it at all since launch.\n\nP.S. Since some of you will be reading this not on opposite day, just swap the meanings of all my points. If you're into strategy games and/or WWI weapons and tactis, this game is worth picking up.","June 16, 2015","true","43.6"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","36","4","11","7","0"

But if you are looking for smaller micromanagement style missions that Soldiers: Heroes of WW2 has, this is not it.\n\nDev comment: "game should be about big dirty and bloody battles, not about stealth."\n\n<original review>:\n\nPricing of this game is not the issue. To get everything you pay 32 euros, check the "Read me before you buy".\n\nThe problem for me with this game is that there are no individual soldiers. Even if there is, you have no time for them. You simply have too many men to control to have time for your soldiers. Soldiers: Heroes of WW2 was based on managing and caring of individual soldiers, not more than 5 or six at a time. With that amount in RTS you can still care for their well being, health, ammunition and actually about placing them in good positions.\n\nAlso in this game (maybe more realistic but not very playable) your soldiers die immediately from one hit. Before you had health that allowed even some sort of "dash to safety". This might change with difficulty level but again SHoWW2 level of difficulty is very had even with health / bandages / revive.\n\nHow Battle of Empires does good or better if compared to old skool Soldiers: Heroes of WW2? Graphics is nicer, some enhancements in inventory system. The controls are a step up from SHoWW2 as well as Direct Control with WASD now.\n\nHowever all the around 12 missions we tried, most of them started with maybe 4-30 units in command and map full of other allies. The mission? "Defend against a large enemy" or "attack the enemy trenches". This proves difficult and not much fun when your framerates start to drop and you start to lose focus of individual soldiers. Now I get the idea developers were after: WW1 was much like this, big groups running towards each other. But surely there were some more covert fights also where you could have only smaller number of troops? There could be missions with focus on smaller units but I couldn't find any.\n\nI understand they want the big fights but this engine is not the right one for this. Already with Men of War the focus started to widen too much from the individual soldier:\n\nWell, like their name says:\nSoldiers: Heroes of WW2 (about individual soldiers, heroes)\n- The best game with this engine!\nMen of War\n- Already men, not man. Good game, not so much stealth missions. Already started to have too large fights\nBattle of Empires\n- Like the name says big battle between empires, no focus on individual soldier\n\nMy advice to developers is:\nwith GEM engine, please create games more focused on individual soldiers.","January 19","false","0.8"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","2"

I wanted this to be a good game but after all iv seen it really seems like the developers are taking after EA which is the worst thing to do. When i bought the game and waited for it to develope i got pretty angered when i found out the German campaign was a DLC, then with even more like multi-player and player VS AI (well known as skermish). the only reason i wanted the game was it would be extremely replayable with a skermish mode plus the German and French campaign, though Early access supporters get french and russian. -_- what? Ok, French im fine with, but Russian? Most people when they think of a First world war game is the battle of the marne and the battle of Verdun, the most well known battles. I really wanted to be able to see both sides and how they made the battles in game, but to see the German side you must go past a pay wall. Honestly, Russian and British should have been the main 2 DLC's. I can see if im correct most or at least a good portion are from Russia, i can see how they would want to add their nation's side into it but to me and more, we are mostely interested in the battles that could have ended the war. To be fair, don;t buy the DLC's at full price, wait until their on sale since their idea is to sell most of the game as DLC, the game on its own is 20 USD, for this, thats pretty reasonable but for a game heading out of Early access and already has 10 DLC, this not good it my eyes.","March 16","false","2.9"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","20","1","5","0","0"

When I first started the game i thought: "oh good, this is men of war in ww1". unfortunatly, they emulated the absolute worst part of the MOW games.... The friggin stealth missions.... I only played this about an hour, but after trying several different missions, I could see this was what most of the game would be.... Really guys? WW1 was not about stealth. I really don't know why the devs thought trying to emulate the worst parts of the MOW campains was a good idea, but they pretty much ruined what looked like the first awsome WW1 RTS.\nMaybe the multi player is better. I don't know, didn't try it and I don't really care. There are other obvous issues, such as awful voice acting and writing(errors all over the place), lack of any history or narrative, or the chaos and brutality of the war not being conveyed.\n\nTLDR:\nAwful single player, awful writing, lack of detail completly ruins it.

Then after i told them to get back up they did but also decided to run backwards then stop turn around and start shooting randomly until they just sort of died. I cannot stress enough how bad of a game this is. And i loveeeeeeeeee strategy games, i would love this game if it wasnt so stupid with its impossible to change camera angles, horrible controls that make me lose the battle i have spent 20 minutes fighting to win. or very vague instructions like hey take the hill... when there are no hills or like 5, defend the field, which one? there are fields everywhere?? You will also want to kill someone because you will spend 10 minutes trying to give an artillery unit the ammo it needs while your being shot at because some weird voodoo witch magic wont let you without some PHD in applied ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•t. Not worth 20 bucks, not even worth 5 bucks. save your money and go buy porn you will get far more hours of enjoyment out of it than with this game.","April 24, 2015","false","2.0"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/krootkinshaper/recommended/316430/","krootkinshaper","Remarkably Cavalier","http://steamcommunity.com/id/krootkinshaper/","315 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nOverall a very bad game.\n\nI have played Heroes of WW2, Men of War, Men of War Assault Squad, and Men of War Assault Squad 2. I think I have a good grasp of the games, with MOW: AS being my favorite (Over 400 hours in that game).\n\nSomeone said, this game looks good, and naturally because I've played for so long, I gave it a shot. I was sorely disapointed.\n\nMen of War: Assault Squad (MOW:AS) completely changed the game. It was the first of the series that introduced the squad system, first of the games that introduced heroic units, streamlined the game play and made it fast paced. The selection of units were great, with different weapons for different nations, on top of tanks and other distinct advantages. It only got better from there with MOW: AS2. Better graphics, steam matchmaking, rankings, and a good amount of updates.\n\nSo with things getting better and better, I expected this to be in line. New concepts, new heroes, new abilities, different tactics. Right? Nope. At the moment, you are presented with a reskined MOW: AS.\n\nSo let's talk about the game on it's own merit. Arty has imensely high lethality. Some might say this is a good thing, and I respect that, but for me all it does is increase the reliance on arty instead of managing the men up front. The heavy arty does come later in the game, with tanks making appearences before the heavy guns. With such lethality, you care less about your men. Tanks? Clumsy, and while it may represent the historical setting, the fact of the matter is there. You have a small unit pool. The interace is garbage. Any improvement on the interface? NOPE.\n\nArmour penetration chances? I have yet to see it. Messages about damaged parts on a vehicles? Yet to see it.\n\nThe game focuses a lot on infantry, and emplacement/light guns to get people out of areas. A different type of shell (Shrapnel) that explodes over the area is a simple grenade type ability to stop people from camping, or to counter MG's. It's my line vs yours, as I'll position my arty and blast whatever I see. Snorefest.\n\nThere really isn't anything else to talk about. The Campaign is pretty bland, it's tough to form an attachment with terrible voice overs that can die in seconds. Some people might like the campaign, I persoanlly didn't like shooting a bunch of men trying to attack a line. For now, DON'T BUY THIS GAME. It brings nothing new to the table, aside from a horse unit, and a shrapnel shot that arty unit's can use.","February 22, 2015","false","1.5"," 5 of 28 people (18%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","18","5","28","0","1"

Having said that it in no way compramises the game play so although it would be nice to have French soldiers with French accents, diddo for other nations, it is not a must.\n> Difficault to comand large numbers of troops.  Can be confusing trying to find the right troops in the right part the battlefield at the right time, but then again that could be considered to enhance its realism so its not so bad.\n\nOverall this game is a great accomplishment and I look forward to seeing it develop further.\n","February 1, 2015","true","6.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I should give the gun a new direction to stop fire?! Should this be normal? When the comand stands on "stop fire", it should gife only one shot, when i give the (one) fire-comand. When i give a shot to the wooden bridge, i reach ma gole with the first shot, but the gun fires shot by shot till it's empty.

Note this is not really like Assault Squad, more like the original Men of War.\n\nPros\n- An RTS that focuses on WWI, something thats rare in and of itself.\n- Crazy in depth unit management, each unit, and vehicle has its own inventory.\n- Everything can be used or captured by you. See an enemy using a machine gun? Kill him and take it, running low on ammo? Search a dead body and scavenge some. See an artilery gun you want? Kill the crew and use it against the enemy.\n- Physics are kickass as always, fully destructible buildings and vehicles.\n\nCons\n- Doesn't look as good as Men of War, something about the uniforms just looks off with the lighting.","December 20, 2014","false","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Having said that it in no way compramises the game play so although it would be nice to have French soldiers with French accents, diddo for other nations, it is not a must.\n> Difficault to comand large numbers of troops.  Can be confusing trying to find the right troops in the right part the battlefield at the right time, but then again that could be considered to enhance its realism so its not so bad.\n\nOverall this game is a great accomplishment and I look forward to seeing it develop further.\n","February 1, 2015","true","6.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Combat varies depending on which mission, but there are generally 2 themes. First off, there's the mobile, tactic focused battles. These are very enjoyable, and quite a challenge. The other is a battle of attrition. The game makes resource management of individual soldiers a priority, and so you must adapt to where the enemy are assaulting, which units have the most ammo, and watching out constantly for gas and artillery.\n\nThat's another thing the game does well: the horrors of war are shown brilliantly. The game may be simple in design, but there is an odd feeling to watching row upon row of these soldiers get slaughtered by new weaponary. Get attached to Olivier? Bam, he just killed by a mortar. Henri? He just got shot. You get the idea\n\nOnly downsides are graphics and voice acting. Animations aren't actually that bad. Another downside is the DLC thing, but in a way this makes it easy for you to pick and choose what parts you actually want to do. However, while I get the intention, I don't like it.\n\nOverall, good game, could do with improvements. 7.75/10","December 30, 2015","true","5.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I had read the reviews and I heard heard how the game was overpriced. I was willing to look over that because if the game was really that fun then I wouldn't mind. So I got it and everytime I launched it or played a mission i was greeted with a frozen screen. Then the game would crash. Im sad to say I cannot even play this game to tell if it was really worth the $35 because it is unpayable at its broken state. I dont reccomend wasting your money on a game that wont even work. I will update this review if it starts working or gets a good update.","May 17","false","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"
