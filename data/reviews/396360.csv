I think that if it came out 20 years ago it would be an arcadey cult classic, but in this stage of video game development it's not there at all.\n\nIf you want to buy a derpy game for your child to play while you go do something, or if you want a funny game to show your friends, go for it. But it's not worth any more than its price tag.\n\n","December 9, 2015","true","1.6"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","9","13","0","0"

It's more of a joke than an actual game.\n\nNormally I'd say that if they fix the glitches the game would be a lot better but I just dont think theres a foundation here for a great game.","December 9, 2015","false","0.8"," 13 of 22 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","13","22","0","2"

I mean this game doesnt really tell you all the controlls... I kinda wouldn't kinda do I kinda like this game but on the other side Not really.. For people who like very stressful games.. I MEAN SERIOUSLY I JUST GOT THIS AND I CANT EVEN CHANGE TO MY GOALIE NOR MY OTHER PLAYERS I MEAN REALLY DID U ADD THOSE IN FOR MORE STRESS BECUASE THE NPC'S CAN USE THE GOALIE THATS BULL****\n\n**EDIT** Just fix that and tell us how to switch to our goalie and our other teammates because i swear\nits Stressful.\n\n***EDIT*** So im here again I read the disc bellow and it said how to change the group and its numpad (Why Numpad? i never use it). The NPC's are very fishy like they are cheating they seem to always want the ball out of bounds when its on their side the Controlls are okay, The gameplay is not very good but its a start I bought this game when it came out so its pretty buggy the NPC's or even me the Ball gets stuck in between our feet like we are a robot rolling around as a wheel for a soccer ball which is silly but you need to fix it and more people will like this game (P.S. This game is like the Impossible game to win)\n\n****EDIT**** I am getting better and better and the spinning mechanic helps me. This is a short edit because i haven't found much more glitches.\n\n*****EDIT***** Okay this is not like a impossible to win game when you get the hang of it. When you do good you get more effectiveness the more you lose the less effective this game is a great time waster to do when your bored! I will highly suggest this game now! He finally updated it and we get to see trading cards. Any stuff like that anybody who see this review, you know I love this game now!\n\n******EDIT****** I love the Customization in this game its silly it brings out such memes Like Spoderman and Bobo Punk. He added Bobo Punk 2 now and I love it. Still You should really get this.\nPlay it for a while get used to it. It'll be fun I betcha. If your reading this all, Appreciate it if you do, You will understand what I like and love about this game and I might make more edits throughout. I'm the longest comment and I just love this game. So peace out until the next edit guys!","December 10, 2015","true","25.9"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","6","9","0","3"
