It's definitely not the worse game I've ever played but I don't know if I would recommend purchasing unless it was discounted, even if it's already cheap to begin with.\n\nThere are definitely positives with this game, don't get me wrong. For several of the quests you're given the option to solve them without having to fight which is a nice change from most games in this genre. So if you find the turn-based fights getting a little repetitive and boring like I did, you have the option to skip some of them by solving your problems non-violently. And the side quests are actually pretty entertaining. Most of them tie in well with the main quests and you usually only have to go out of your way to solve them if you forgot to get them in the first place.\n\nThe character designer is pretty awesome. You get to shade your character the way you like and pick from a few specific features and then fine tune them which I liked. I also liked the way you leveled up and aquired different designs and body modifications for your character (though I wish you could have picked the way they looked a little more).\n\nSome of the NPCs you interact with are just gorgeously designed. Oberon is a pretty amazing looking character and your companions are all very fleshed out and look amazing. At the same time it's clear that they copied and pasted a lot of the character designs and that can get a little confusing. In the last mirror world it gets a little confusing to remember which little bearded man is which and on The Flying Dutchman all the Korrigans pretty much look the same. They're still nice to look at though.\n\nMy biggest problem with the game though were the two middle levels, the Tree World and The Flying Dutchman. The environment is just not player friendly. In the Tree World you're trying to find stuff amongst the branches and the leaves constantly block the camera so you keep having to go back and forth, round and round to find a character or a nest in order to complete a quest. It's frustrating and I had to keep turning the game off to keep myself from hitting the screen. The Flying Dutchman level does it with darkness and the holds of the ship. It's almost impossible to see where you're going and you have to hunt down three monsters on sound alone.\n\nThere is no voice acting which is fine, better no voice-acting than bad voice-acting. But there are weird parts where characters are "talking" and pointing to things and you literally have no idea what's going on. "Over there" amounts to nothing when you don't show what "over there" means.\n\nOf course there's no real ending. Apparently there was supposed to be a sequel that never got made and it's a little bit frustrating that you don't really get a reward or even just a feeling of sastifaction from all that you did.\n\nAnd a little pet peeve of mine is with the dialogue. You're allowed to choose the gender of the character but there are quite a few times where it's clear that the game was made with a male main character in mind because the pronouns get confused. I don't mind playing a male character, heck half the time I choose to do so when given the option, but if you're going to let me pick a female character make an effort to get it right.","June 19, 2014","false","9.9"," 332 of 385 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","332","385","0","0"

I just completed about 1/3 of it, and wanted to post my thoughts:\n\n1) The artwork is spectacular, and the character creation is extremely customizable. Sure a few models get re-used, but what the heck, they're fey folk!\n\n2) The story so far is very engaging. You can delve into characters and world backgrounds by talking to various inhabitants in the various worlds you visit. I'm quite impressed also with the customization of your character as it levels up.\n\n3) for under $8 this game is already a winner for me, as I usually rate my games by how much it cost me per hour to play, and I'm still playing and still enjoying.\n\nIf you like somewhat casual RPG's (I also enjoyed Lauren the Amazon princess), this game will enchant and delight you. I find the default difficulty to be just right for a casual gamer like myself, but you can increase or decrease the difficulty as you like during play.\n\nAll in all, a beautiful 3D RPG with classic fairy tale elements drawn from numerous mythologies. (British, Norse, Arabic to name the ones I've encountered so far). You will NOT be disappointed for $7.49 or even the regular $9.99 price.","June 16, 2014","true","16.8"," 123 of 148 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","123","148","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Syntax-Error/recommended/303790/","Syntax-Error","Syntax Error","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Syntax-Error/","1197 products in account","Faery is an RPG that had some real potential and it showed in some places but ultimately doesn't follow through.  It's not a terrible game and I wish I had better than a Yes/No option to rate it but, out of the two, I can't recommend it.\n\nThe plot of the game is fairly simple.  You are a fairy and have been awoken from stasis where you slept for centuries only to find that the land of the fae has shrunk and changed for the worse.  The effects of man, various fairy creatures moving away to new realms and more threaten the lands.  So the fairy king sets you off on a mission to explore the remaining accessible fairy worlds and find out what's up.  You run a few quests to gain a couple companions and you're off.\n\nFor the most part game play is very simple.  Each world map is extremely small and so being asked to retrieve an object (90% of the missions are fetch quests) just has you cruising the small map looking for the sparkling object you need.  There are few non-essential opponents on the map so once you clear them -- and they guard chests so you'll want to clear them -- there's little barrier between you and your objectives.  Some quests may be solved in multiple ways such as a horn that you can either gain as a reward for doing a deed or else steal by creating a distraction.  But ultimately all your choices lead you to the same place.\n\nCombat is turn based and uses an action point system.  More powerful attacks use more points and, as well, more powerful are of effect style attacks (and your heals) have timers so they can't be used until the second or third turn of combat.  In general I found the combat to be extremely simple.  Playing on the default setting (I don't remember if there's harder settings) I never once wiped and rarely had even a single companion go unconscious.  Supposedly, if you wipe, you all respawn at the mirrors, your entrance from zone to zone, to try again.\n\nAs you level up, you gain new abilities and this was one of the sticking points for me: new abilities are tied to physical changes to your character.  So a poison strike attack requires you to have a scorpion tail and a power buff requires goat horns.  Either you stick with a few abilities and just level those up or else you become a patchwork menagerie of animal parts and tattoos.  I opted for the former.  As well, you can gain equipment to enhance your elemental powers.\n\nAside from all this, there's a collection of companions you'll gain along the way which are fairly inventive and each has their own strengths.  One companion is a pistol firing pirate, another summons a raccoon to fight for him and another is a young dragon among others.  There is something of an approval system for your companions although I never had anyone refuse to travel with me.  I did have one fellow pledge his love to me but that didn't seem to go anywhere past the declaration of our affections.  Bioware quality companions this was not but perhaps they'd have been fleshed out in the sequels that aren't meant to be.\n\nUltimately the game just felt shallow and unresolved even allowing for the fact that it was intended to be the first chapter of a trilogy.  The worlds are inventive but small and the quests are linear and obvious.  The characters are interesting but the approval system feels pointless.  Combat was different from today's norm but was also extremely easy and the character customization issues could leave you feeling handicapped.  Because the game is fairly brief (even my 12 hour playtime includes a few lengthy breaks from the keyboard) I was able to complete but I only felt just invested enough to keep going but not enough to really care.  If you have this in a bundle it may be worth playing just to see if you like it but I can't recommend it as a purchase.","May 17, 2015","false","12.5"," 80 of 91 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","80","91","3","0"

It's a short (I beat it in 10 hours) and sweet little RPG with combat in the turn-based form many of the classics of the 90s were in.  There is nothing groundbreaking about this game, but it does what it does properly.  The game is short, but not in a bad way... sometimes RPGs are way too long.  There are only 4 areas to explore and the content is limited, but it all flows well and once you're about to get bored something else piques your interest. So, if you are looking for a quick and new world to explore combined with a turn-based RPG experience that may make you nostalgic for the RPGs you grew up on, I think you will like this.\n\nThe graphics and sound are decent, but nothing special.  And the game worked just fine for me; I experienced no glitches or crashes.  The customization and new party members are limited, but it is enough to keep the combat fresh until the end.  There is no voice acting, but no voice acting > bad voice acting... and it adds to the potential nostalgic enjoyment. So Faery - Legends of Avalon doesn’t have the most elaborate feature list; but what it does have is perfectly adequate.\n\nThe story is OK, full of predictable tropes, but it was entertaining enough... and it ends right when you may start getting bored.  A lot of people complain that this game ends on a cliffhanger, and it does.  Also, the developers have said they won't finish the story.  It's akin to a TV show being canceled.  But if you just accept that the "to be continued" at the end of the game should be read as "the end" it winds up playing as a self-contained story with an open ending.  Many stories use open endings on purpose that are worse than this game's ending.  Anyway, you will have to decide for yourself how you feel about it.\n\nLastly, the game is very easy, even on hard.  It's a simple game, so there are no advanced strategies needed.  The depth of strategy boils down to basic elemental strengths/weaknesses and remembering to heal.  Also, much of what would be excessive combat can be avoided by completing quests diplomatically.\n\nI can say all-in-all I enjoyed playing through this game, so I give it a thumbs up, but I can see how others with different taste may not enjoy the game.\n\nFollow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!","October 20, 2014","true","10.2"," 57 of 63 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","57","63","0","4"

The story is told like a beautiful fairy-tale and makes you curious how it continues. I don’t want to tell you too much about the story, because I don’t want to spoil the game adventure. But what I can tell you:\n\nYou play a „Faery“ and as such you fly through the game! Really a great feeling (especailly the fast fly with 'Shift'). You will visit different worlds, you have a main mission and you can do lots of small quests. The battles are turn based and with every win you will get experience points to raise your level. With a higher level you get skill points and you have to decide which ability you want to learn or to improve. Some skills also change the characters look (for example the „better avoiding“ skill looks like a cattail). In the different worlds you can also find treasure chests (for some of them you will have to fight) but it’s worth it because you can get health items and also equipment for your character (e. g. new armor with also different looks and elements).\n\nStory: Absorbing! 10/10\nGameplay: Lot‘s of options and alternation in this game which keep your attention. 10/10\nControls: The controls are easy to handle (okay the flying is not always that easy). 8/10\nGraphic: It’s not the best graphic but still enough to be comfortable in the fantasy world. 7/10\nSound: No special music. The sounds are okay but far away from stunning. 3/10\n\nPrice: 9,99 € - in my eyes a fair price for this game.\nMore: Achievements, Steam trading cards, playable with keyboard / mouse OR controller.\n\nI recomment this game for rolegameplayers who are not only searching violence and action, but also peaceful fairy-tale adventures.","August 6, 2014","true","1.8"," 42 of 42 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","42","42","0","6"

Fantasy RPGs are right up my alley, so I gave this one a shot.  I'll cut to the chase:\n\nPros:\n(+) Pleasant graphics and graphical style.\n(+) Reasonable system requirements-- you can probably run this game.\n(+) Flying around is fun!\n(+) Richly customizable avatars (almost MMO quality); can choose male (elf) or female (faery);\n(+) Skill selection manifests itself on your avatar as a "metamorphosis."\n(+) Three difficulty levels.\n(+) I didn't find any bugs or glitches.\n(+) Trading cards and achievements-- easy enough to 100% if you do all of the side quests and explore a bit.  To my knowledge, you can't get locked out of an achievement unless you end the game, in which case you can restore a previous save.\n\nMeh:\n(~) Story is a little generic, but better than nothing.\n(~) Combat is "classic turn-based," but also a bit generic.\n(~) Quests are-- wait for it-- a bit generic.\n\nCons:\n(-) No voice acting.\n(~) Controller support is a bit lacking-- it's not obvious what buttons to click to navigate parts of the UI, and sometimes the mouse pointer appears in the middle of the screen and you can't get rid of it unless you move it away with a mouse.  I was able to muddle through it though.\n(-) The game seems to set itself up for a sequel, but from what I understand, this is unlikely to happen.  The story of this game is wrapped up, but the larger plot may feel unresolved.\n\nOverall, it's a decent fantasy turn-based RPG, but maybe better suited for a younger audience as it's a bit generic and doesn't have a great deal of depth.  Note that some of the visuals and characters could be a bit scary for small children (see the promo video)-- up to you how you want to handle that.\n\nAll in all, a really nice game!

Was suprised to see it released today and for that price said what the hell.  Upon starting it I saw the spiders (the developer's logo) and instantly knew it was the right decision.  After playing Mars War Logs last year, Bound by Flame, and then Of Orcs and Men (Co-developed by them I belive) I have come to the realization that they are probably my favourite RPG developer of the last couple of years.\n\nSo this game has a great atmosphere, and art style.  The music hasn't blown me away, whereas some of there other games have some great, sometimes, stuff.  No voice acting at all in this game FYI though that's ok.  The writing is not quite as smooth as some of their latest effforts but still humourous and charming.  All the NPCs have been entertaining so far, and the turn based combat is enjoyable.\n\nTwo of its strong points are the flying as a fairy which is a blast ziping across the map, hovering etc, all done very effortlessly by a couple of different ways either with the keys or mouse.  Also the character customization is unique and meaningful which really I believe is where Spiders are at the top of their game in all these RPGs.  The skill points you allocate are slotted at different body parts which both affect the way your fairy looks, male or female, and different skills like fire spells or lighting etc.  these then will branch and allow for other exclusive powers and then you can increase the level of each of these.\n\nSo yeah great spiders RPG character customization, engaging turn based combat, full flying exploration of the different levels, and a charming story about faerys and the dying of magic which lots of recognizable lore like Pan, mermaids, and the tree of the world.","June 16, 2014","true","1.9"," 78 of 101 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","78","101","0","0"

You creat the initial character, then the skills and traits you choose as you level up will alter things, like what sort of wings you have and other cosmetic alterations. All armor pieces have a unique look as well. The fairy tale style story telling is not for everyone but I liked it. Lastly, voice acting would be very welcome. A lot of characters have very distinct personalities that could be greatly enhanced with good voice actors.","March 25, 2015","false","6.4"," 46 of 53 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","46","53","0","3"

Just giving it a thumbs up or down doesn't seem fair. It's a very simple RPG and not the most fun game ever, but there are some things the studio got right.\n\nTo give you some basis of my review... I purchased the game while I was sick with a cold and looking for something cheap and fast I could play casually while I was stuck in bed.  I finished about half of the game, recovered from sickiness, then forgot I even had it on my computer until I was upgrading the system. I guess the fact I forgot Faery was there is a telling sign that this game isn't very exciting.\n\nYou start off in Legends of Avalon as a male or female fairy/elf, customised to your liking, and with the usual bout of gameplay amnesia. Apparently your character decided to become comatose for some amount of years because the lands of Avalon were getting too weird. Long story short, your job is to go around different aspects of the faery plane and figure out why the magic is supposedly all janky and the inhabitants are acting crazy/aloof/lazy. Let the fetch quests begin!\n\nHere is what the game does right...\n\n1. Flying around is superbly easy and actually fun. You will spend 100% of your time flying in this game. Controls are simple with mouse and keyboard or a controller. A good portion of my logged hours probably come from me just zooming around and testing the borders of each level's space. The scaling of your character and its environment is also nice. You really do feel small when you're flying around or talking to the bigger more humanoid characters.\n\n2. Upgrading your character actually changes its physical appearance. This ranges from changes in armour to actual body modifications like horns, wings, tails, tattoos, etc... Each addition adds perks or changes your fighting style and/or element. It's really great seeing how your character changes through the game.\n\n3. Traditional faery lore. You can see that there was some thought put into how the game world would be constructed and it definitely borrows from the older legends of fae.\n\n4. How you respond to other characters changes the game dynamics. Not terribly, you won't be locked out of any quests or not be able to finish the main mission. The game is still very linear and definitely nothing at Mass Effect level moral decisions, but your actions do affect the style of your gameplay. For example, if you say something which conflicts with one of your followers, they'll begin to dislike you. If you're awesome to them, they'll give you gifts of armour or weapons. Fetch quests often give you the ability to choose between combative solutions and conversation based solutions. Sometimes you can get out of going through a horde of tedious turn-based battles if you opt to assemble a tool or talk to a certain character the right way.\n\n5. Battles are turn-based, so you might like or hate that. However, you can avoid many battles simply by flying over them. Most of the time, unless it's a boss or necessity to get to a new area, you choose when you want to fight. Of course, if you ignore too many battles, your level will be too low to take on a boss. Most of the battles are pretty simple and require only a minimum amount of strategy. This might be good if you have no experience at this type of gameplay. There's no blood or gore (enemies either fade away or slump over when defeated), quite low on the violence level, so this might be good if you're looking for something more kid friendly.\n\nHere is where the game has problems...\n\n1. The level design is quite boring. The textures are good and everything is well modelled, blah blah blah... But it's all just rather dull looking. If it wasn't for the characters, you could pluck the bulk of the landscapes out of any other game. With the exception of maybe the scarab level, it's just not very "magical" feeling. Even though the levels appear huge because you're a small fairy, the levels are tiny and there are tons of invisible walls. I imagine it's akin to the feeling a mouse would have being locked in a living room. If you're looking for an open word type game, this is definitely not it! The game world starts feeling small very quickly.\n\n2. Fetch quests! Not necessarily a bad thing. Everyone goes into an RPG game knowing that they're about to do fetch quests. But these quests just feel kinda empty most of the time. You can't interact with objects in the environment and there are practically no FMVs. Collecting a special item (and by collecting I mean flying over to it then seeing it disappear) and returning it to the correct NPC just makes your screen fade to black then open up to you in another dialog screen. It's very unfulfilling. At one point... !!!SPOILER!!! ... You're tasked with helping a baby dragon hatch, but you never see the process at all. The dragon just appears next to you as a follower.\n\n3. On the note of NPC's, get ready to see a lot of the same models over and over again with just different clothing. Even their mannerisms are the same. Dialog is done through text only, there is no voice acting. If you're an old school gamer, you won't so much mind the lack of voices, There are plenty of games which do just fine without having that element of sound. But it is very awkward watching the characters mouth every word of the subtitles. Faery feels more like a game meant to have voice acting, but the studio might have run out of money to finish that part.\n\n4. This is the first and last game of the series. You get the four small levels that come with Legends of Avalon and that's it. The story was left open because of the intention of this being a series of Xbox Live titles. Very anti-climatic. Faery was produced by a small studio and it didn't make them enough money to continue the series. You can tell that the team has talent because of the awesome looking concept art during loading screens and the attention to lore. It would be nice to see this game redone by a larger studio with more funds and time. Seems like lost potential for a game world which could have been much more immersive and interesting.\n\nWould I recommend this game? Yes and no. If it's only £5/$5, then yes. It did entertain me briefly so I don't feel like I lost money. I got a stable, playable game for the same amount of money as a sandwich and chips. Do you need to go out of your way to play this game? No.  You won't be missing anything important.","October 27, 2015","false","7.5"," 36 of 41 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","36","41","0","1"

The graphics work well for the quirky, fey, slightly childish feel of the game. I love the way you customise the main character as you level up, your physical appearance drastically changes. The equipment sets look distinctive as well. Flying freely through levels and finding hidden items is also a lot of fun. I enjoy the story of being a Fey going through various realms based on different folk tales, the world initially feels a little childish but there are some slightly dark elements to the plot. I like turn-based RPGs and enjoy the idea of seeing a game that mixes my favourite console RPG and computer RPG styles.\n\nThis game is often accused of being unfinished. It is a finished, if very short, game, but it is blatantly the first in a series of games. Unfortunately the rest of the games don't actually exist. I wish this game was longer but I don't think it feels unfinished.\n\nMy only other criticisms of the game are that initial character creation is a little limited (it is fun to be able to colour your hair and skin any colour you want though), you can barely customise other party members, and that I've had the occasional issue running it, nothing I couldn'teasily fix.\n\n","July 2, 2015","true","11.9"," 23 of 24 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","23","24","0","0"

It's not terrible, but it's definitely not worth the 'Very Positive' reviews status it currently boasts, and if it had shown a more realistic "Mixed Reviews" as it deserves, I probably would not have gotten it.  But it's not awful enough to deserve a "Would not recommend" all on its own, either. Maybe 5/10.\n\nI picked this game up because I was craving an old-school turn-based RPG, and on that, it delivers.  It also has nods to folklore of several different cultures, not just typical Celtic lore, which was unexpected but very appreciated.  Its premise had the potential of being quite cool, and its combat and spell system also had potential.  The problem is, it has the -potential- for a lot of really nice things, but on most of them, it doesn't follow through.\n\nThe story itself has an intriguing concept and that was what initially made me buy the game.  But it's never developed in the game itself and has no real resolution.  What story there is is made significantly more flat by the fact that there is no voice acting.  You're basically watching permutations of the same three character designs pantomime surprise or happiness at you while the same song plays on repeat for the entire ~9hrs of gameplay.  The game itself ends right before what seems like it should be a final boss fight.  It's probably supposed to feel like a cliffhanger but really just feels more like the game was never finished--it literally even asks you to save right after the dialogue announcing your intention to fight and then rolls credits on you instead.\n\nMy other biggest gripes is with the gameplay.  Your character's appearance is dictated by what spells you want to have, and visa versa.  You can be a moderately beautiful bird-winged faery who gets exactly two very marginal spells, or you can be a mishmosh monster faery with ant antennae, goat horns, a scorpion tail, and have six much more efficient spells with multiple variation options for their effects.  Every spell is tied to a physical appendage being added to your character, which basically renders any time you spent on your character's appearance moot, and frankly, their rule of thumb seems like the more effective the spell, the uglier the addition to your appearance.  The most gameplay-altering choices of your appearance also come very early on in the game (like level 3) and there is no going back from them, so by the time you realize you've locked yourself out of the best abilities, you basically have to redo the entire game to change your choice.\n\nOverall, the game wasn't -bad-, persay.  It's okay for what it is, which is a time-waster turn-based RPG with some interesting concepts but not much depth.  I would recommend it to someone looking to waste a few hours, but I wouldn't recommend it without a whole lot of caveats attached.","December 21, 2014","false","9.2"," 28 of 35 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","28","35","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/smerlus/recommended/303790/","smerlus","smerlus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/smerlus/","363 products in account","It stinks that Steam only offers two ratings, "Recommended" and "Not Recommended" as Faery had me thinking a lot about how to classify it. On one hand there's a charming game with a pretty good art design, quick movement and an interesting world while on the other hand the story isn't finished, (and never will be) the game is too easy and the quests are pretty much fetch quests.\n\nThe fetch quests aren't too bad as the world's that I traveled were pretty compact, usually beautiful and the characters travel pretty damn quickly. It's not like I'm hiking 5-10 minutes just to get back to a person that I just fetched a mushroom for. The combat isn't horrible either, in fact it does have some depth to it but on the default difficulty setting I only had one character knocked out once simply because I knew the enemies weren't going to win so I decided not to waste time using a healing spell.\n\nIn the 7 or so hours I played the game I gathered a party of some interesting looking characters. I say "looking" because the game never really delves into their personalities. There was a scholarly Troll, a mad hatter looking character with a habit of keeping animals as friends to summon in battle, an efrit, and a little dragon just to name a few. The all handle pretty similarly in battle with maybe just a few tweaks here and there.\n\nThe game uses mirrors to teleport that characters to the different world's and I saw The Flying Dutchman, Yggdrasil and a town on the back of a giant Scarab amongst the gathering of mirrors but most of the teleport stations remained inactive which I'll discuss later on in my biggest complaint about the game.\n\nThen the game wraps it all together with turn based combat that is pretty easy and an equipment screen where different sets up armor and weapon changes the look of the main Faery and the look depends if you picked a male or female protagonist.\n\nOne of the more interesting aspects of the game was the leveling system. Here's were the character is upgraded a point at a time and the points are invested in areas that change the appearance of the Faery. Dragonfly style wings enable the character to cast fire spells, bird wings would enable wind spells and I had to choose because you're not allowed to have both. The game further defines the character with tattoos, auras, tails, horns etc... My final Faery was a female with dragonfly wings, a scorpion's tail, ant like antennae, some tattoos and a wisp that hovered around her. It was a pretty interesting feature and I enjoyed cycling through the options and weighing the looks and benefits of the spells/abilities that the choices gave me.\n\nThe main downside is that the game doesn't feel finished. Now there are right ways to do a trilogy or set a story up for a sequel and there are wrong ways. I feel the correct way is to have a conflict, then a resolution within a single game but it doesn't have to be the resolution to the main conflict. Faery: Legends of Avalon ends right when the story is reaching a climax and I thought I was about to fight the first major battle in the game only to be greated with some text and the credits. There were plenty of mirrors left to travel to but they all remained inactive due to the cliffhanging ending of the game.\n\nThere's also a strange lack of sound coming from the majority of characters while traveling the world which lends an empty feeling to the environments despite the music being good. There are also some spelling errors in the text.\n\nDon't get me wrong, there's a lot to like about this game and I think it's probably near the top of Spiders' best works yet and this is where I don't think Steam's way of catogorizing games really does F:LoA justice. I would recommend this game with some reservations because, like me, some of these complaints are deal breakers.","October 21, 2014","true","7.4"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","17","18","0","0"

They are one of the few game makers that try to break free of the 'norm' when it comes to fantasy RPG's and occasionally try things that are little bit different than the "Tolkien tropes" of other games.\n\nUnfortunately, they also always seem to lose interest in FINISHING any of the ideas they come up with, leaving each game half baked and not quite finished (it was the same with Mars War Logs as well).\n\nThis game is no exception. There are some GREAT ideas in this game (the fae setting is a really brilliant idea and the way you develop and upgrade your character and have it physically affect your appearance is very interesting) but again - everything feels unpolished and not quite thought through completely. It's short, ends at a cliffhanger that will probably never be resolved and with a not particularly interesting main story.\n\nThat said, there's enough there to make it entertaining for a few hours. Providing you grab it at a discount during a steam sale then I don't think you'd be TOO disappointed. It might actually work quite well as an entry-level RPG for a younger gamer if you drop the difficulty level down to easy. It also lacks the casual mysogyny of their newer stuff like Bound By Flame.\n\nIf Spiders took what they learned from this game and put it into a sequel or another game in the same world I think they could come up with something really fun...but as with their other games, instead of building on and fleshing out the game systems they create, they seem to just get bored and move on to ANOTHER short RPG with fancier graphics, a completely different setting and a whole NEW set of half-baked mechanics and they end up right back at square one again.

You can fly around like a fairy and help (or fight) other creatures. The graphics are good, and they fit with the atmosphere in the game. The story line is okay, it is an interesting and a fairyesque(is that a word?) story, but also a bit linear and also very short. You can mostly choose between a violent or non violent option to solve the quest. When you talk to an NPC you can also choose between the good (blue texts), neutral (white texts) and evil options (red texts). So with that you can also make a NPC let you like you more, or less. And with that you can solve quests or problems as well.\n\nThe character customization is good, you can make a cute looking fairy, but if you want to make an evil one, go ahead. When you level up you can give your fairy special skills and equipment. You can also find several companions to help you in your adventures.\nSo now the combat: it is turnbased, and some skills/spells work better on your enemy than others. It is a bit of balancing who you take with you, so you can do max damage. But you can find a companion who heals you and your allies as well, or do it yourself.\n\nThere are only a few things that bug me a bit. I don't like the black lines around characters and objects (I know it is a small thing, sorry).\nAnd I miss a bit of voiceacting. You see the animations in the conversations, see them talking, but you can't hear them. Which is a bit awkward in my opinion.\n\nBut overall I enjoy the game. I like the story, and the combat. I would recommend it to buy it in the sale. If you think that the combat is too easy, you can change the difficulty in options by the way.\nI hope they make a new game, which you would expect because of the open ending. But no one heard about a upcoming sequel.\n\nMy rating for the game: 7/10","October 12, 2014","true","8.7"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

On harder difficulties combat is nice and rewarding, and on easier difficulties the game becomes a breeze to get through.\n\nThe worlds are filled with unique characters and quests that are well thought out and fit in the world, and you encounter many different races on your journey.\n\nSadly, this game feels unpolished in many other aspects. All the dialogue is unvoiced and delivered through subtitles, and the music, while fitting, sounds like a repetitive rip-off of the Harry Potter movie soundtrack.\n\nIt also has very limited controller support: while you can control your character in the world with it, for menus and combat you're forced to use a mouse and keyboard combo. At least with my setup. The game is marked as both Partial and Full Controller support, which I guess means just that.\n\nAnd sadly, as of right now (October 2014) the game is broken. The executable will not work, so you'll have to track down a patch from another site as well as copy the PhysX DLL to the game folder to get it to work at all.\n\nAs I'm writing this review, the game costs €2,50, and for that price, I think it's definitely worth it. I suspect it will give me easily 10 hours of playtime or more to get through, and I do want to continue. So it gets a thumbs up, with warnings.","October 10, 2014","true","1.7"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","1"

My son, who just turned 11, is having fun learning the game.   I have been playing RPG's for over 32 years.  I love games where the main character can be a faery.  You get to fly almost anywhere.  With each leveling up, you can to choose what you want to add or upgrade.  The game IS NOT all about slah and hack.  I love that feature.\n\nCONS: You have to live with the upgrades and attribute choices made.  Once you select, you cannot do a take back.  That is only a minor setback though.  I decided to just not make some choices, the next time I play.  The largest setback is tat just when you are really getting into the story, it ends.  You are left with a "to be continued" feeling.\n\nOverall:  The first playing it, took not too long.  It ended too quick.  Had a lot of fun playing it.  My son played it for over an hour before I bumped him.  (Not many games grab his attention for that long.)  For mere fun and entertainment purposes, I feel satisified with the purchase.

And it works, from combat simple enough for a child to understand (I suspect there might be reasons to that), to a really nice levelling system that doesn't seem to be possible to break.\n\nIf you're an RPG fan looking for something a little "lighter" than normal, pick this up.

However, while it didn't disappoint me, having beaten it after barely 10 hours of play, I would say that it never managed to climb out of mediocre status.  As many of the other comments have indicated, the game feels incomplete.  It stops after you've saved three worlds when you make a very important decision which I won't discuss here for risk of spoilers.  The developers clearly introduced several new models in the third world to make additional worlds viable ... but nothing.  In fact, a major plot point is dropped on you right before the end that was completely unexplored nor foreshadowed in earlier gameplay and yet not unexpected when the revelation is made.  All in all, I wish the game had been completed or had been released chapter style like Wolf Among Us, etc.  Still, not bad for a simple RPG.

However here I finished the whole game with all the achievements in 7 hours before I could get tired of it and felt satisfied that I had explored everything of interest in the game.\n\nThe good parts of the game include the varied caricatured character design, the customisation of your character and the 3D flying exploration.

The story can evolve very differently, the characters are well made and have very distinct personas and the art is gorgeus. The mechanics are very simple and easy to learn and the combat resembles the Final Fantasy series alot. Flying is done by looking in the direction you are going and pressing a button (as I used WASD it was W, but you can also use your mouse for this).\n\nThe character creation is simple, but gives a lot of possibilities for your characters look. The leveling system and skill gaining (called metamorphosis) also impacts on what your character looks like. As an example: Focusing on fire magic means that your character has dragonfly wings that grow and gain a pattern later on. Tattoos in the face, around your leg and arm signify certain skills as does differet wings, tails, horns, auras and trails. Absolutely loved this.\n\nThe story is also good, but is cut short as this is the first part of a non-finished trilogy which I am very sad about. This story had A LOT of potential and could have been amazing when finished. Considering the price it is still worth the money though since the game has a lot of re-playability due to the fact that your actions change the story as you go along and you can play around with skills as well.\n\nThe art of the game is also gorgeus. A lot thoughts has gone into the visual aspects and all of the areas are thought through from which faery creatures appear there to the general feel of the area through background music.","February 7","true","9.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There are a lot of really good idea here, and it's a little disappointing that they don't seem to have been fully implemented. Still, it's fun to play and it harkens back to good, old-fashioned turn-based combat and questing from the Final Fantasy VII era without the tediousness of frequent random battles and mind-numbing level grinding.

I beat it in 7 hours, and that's with alot of time spent going back and forth, back and forth, talking to the same people over and over. All of the gameplay elements are actually competently executed, but, with such a short game, are really shallow and simplistic. The story is somewhat interesting but, again, too short and shallow to really get into, and it just ends, boom, with no resolution (or final boss!). The exploration/RPG aspects are NOT well done; oftentimes, you know what to do, but can't until you find the ONE guy to set you on the path (the path to speak to the OTHER guy, and you already knew you had to speak to that guy, but no, while you could just ask guy A what to do, you can't ask guy B unless directed). Even worse, however, is that the opposite will happen; you'll be told you need a MacGuffin, and suddenly you will get dialogue options to ask people about the owne of the MacGuffin, despite no one having told you his name. Several questlines were cut short via this short-cut, quite accidentally. Also, amusingly, the journal that tracks everyone you meet will sometimes tell you who characters are (relevative to the story) or what to do before the story actually gets that far. And don't expect character development; everyone is one note, period.\n\nSo, sure, it's got a decent art design, acceptable sound and music, not a terrible system, and the story is midlly interesting, but between poor coding and simply being far too short and too shallow, there just isn't much to recommend about this game. As for replay value, barely; yeah, you can level your character differently and use different team members, but this isn't Baldur's Gate--these changes are very small, and the game is so easy anyway (I never once, not ONCE, used a healing item of any sort), that it's not a "different experience" to play like this. As for "choices" in the game, sure, there are; mostly, you can either complete fetch quests or just muscle your way through bad guys--that's it, that's your choice system. It's all the same in the end. You can also be an insufferable jerk if you like, but again, it doesn't matter. There is just no meat to this; it's too short, too simple, too basic, to warrant any real attention, except as a fun way to pass maybe a single day, or as an introductory RPG for a small kid.","May 10, 2015","false","7.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Unfortunately, despite this nice bit of control the game is let down by its combat which takes you away from the flying, go-anywhere feel, and puts you into a dull turn-based combat system.\n\nAll that having been said, the game does have its good points. The characters in the game look really original and are distinctly different from each other almost to the point of being caricatures. As you level up in the game you can unlock new spells and when choosing which one to obtain you affect the appearance of your character by changing parts of them; this system makes you much more invested in your character.\n\nOverall I feel like this could have been a great game if only all of the lovely monsters and their animations had been an open part of the game rather than being put into a turn-based combat system that rips you from any immersion. I would also have appreciated a nicer UI and, as many other have mentioned, some voice acting.\n\nI will eventually play through the game some more if only to see some of the things in the screenshots that look so imperssive and will change my review if it gets better.","January 5","false","0.9"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

Played through the whole thing in 8 hrs with all achievements. Remember that amazingly illustrated Faeries book from the 70s (80s?)? This is like playing that book.\n\n\nPros:\n\nFor me one of the best things about this game is getting to FLY. This might make me sound like a 10-year-old little girl but it is seriously way too much fun to be a faery and swoop around through the air. Not enough fantasy RPGs include the ability to fly, in my opinion.\n\nOMG the art design. Wow. Just wow.\n\nSolid gameplay, character customization, and story.\n\n\nCons:\n\nObviously needs a sequel. There's no resolution to the story.\n\nSome aspects of gameplay could be expanded upon - like getting more rewards for talking to your companions, more types of equipment, etc. Also, I wish you could custom level up your companions.\n\nBattles are really easy. I never lost a single battle. Healing potions were totally useless because I never needed them.\n\nAs other reviewers have noted, it is sometimes hard to see where you are going because the environments and other characters get in the way... I sometimes ended up with a headache flying around looking for my objective.\n\n\nOverall a beautiful and very worthwhile game.","October 12, 2014","true","9.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Exclusivly. Which would be fine in small doses. The problem is that the fetch quests take you all over the same island multiple times to the point it gets tedious. A lot of the objectives werent important to the story in any way (such as the fetch quests to add a party member to your group). Then when you think you're making progress you hit another obstacle that seems to be there just to stretch out the time the quest would take. Find a missing page, search the entire island after you just did it the first time to find your first companion. You get the page, oh wait theres a bird there, go to the other side of an island to get a fish to give to the bird to get the page to give to the NPC so he can join you.\n\nThe game itself is beautiful and the character customization really adds motivation to the otherwise bland turn based combat, each level you gain you can pick a new fairy ability that gives your character a physical change, be it wings, or horns, or tatoos which tie into the combat, but the entire experience just feels so padded, like they werent happy with the total length of the game deep into development and didnt have the time/money to add more content.\n\nIf  its ever on sale and you dont mind a slow, and I mean really slow start I would reccomend this game, but if you paid more than 5$ for this I wouldnt say you are getting your money's worth. Obviously with only an hour played at time of writing I cant call this review anything more than a first impressions, but if they felt the need to stretch out the game so much from the very first level im not too interested what later stages hold.\n","October 13, 2014","false","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It centers around the main character that you create solving the problems in a given world before advancing forward in the next one. Faery, however, is an incomplete game. All the mechanics are there, the gameplay, the story, even the combat system. All these things just need more work put into them before it is complete. This game has a beautiful artsyle and is executed well graphically. I found myself drawn to this game in the first place because of the graphics. But graphics DON'T make a game. The story is pretty generic. It had its moments but all in all it is very predictable. Go to place y, fix thing x, solve problem z, return to me for your reward type of deal. This playstyle is amazing for games like Skyrim and Mass Effect and generally RPG games as a whole. However those games give you a sense of adventure, fullfillment and endless possibilities. They have substance to back it up. Faery seems to desperatly want to provide that to the player but just falls short. This is a shame cause I think the game could have actually been something. I found myself wanting to like this game so much as I played but I was ultimately dissapointed. If Faery was put back into development and polished up, given a more wholesome stroy and a better dialog, I would have no problem giving it a 9/10.

The flitting around like a flying fey on speed was quite enjoyable. Much of it's appeal come from that and also the realization that your character is really tiny as seen when you encouter the seagul in the 1st chapter.\n\nThe turnbased combat was a bit of a let down, it reminded me too much of many JRPG style combats. I am not a fan of that style of combat.  This game would of been better as a first person shooter style RPG.\n\nThe dialog and discussion choices were not bad for an RPG, in no way the worst. The plot and story was interesting. As were the quests you had to do. Also the style of leveling up with the choosing new physical features that upgraded your powers was a good idea.\n\nOne f the big issues is it is over way too quick.

You play as a fairy reawakened from statis inside a crystal to take on the quest of saving the magic in the world.\n\nWhat makes the environments so solidly interesting is that they truly make you feel the size of a fairy. A tree is the size of a skyscraper! A seagull is a monstrosity that could swallow you whole! The story is steeped in the mythology of various cultures - Norse, Greek, and Middle Eastern in particular. True, it's not graphically on par with games released this year, but that didn't detract from my enjoyment of it.\n\nWhat did that was the incomplete story line. Be warned, all who may consider buying and enjoying this game, that it was created to be part one of a series and the studio currently has no plans to begin work on part two, citing that the game did not sell well enough to merit it. I knew upon buying it that the game is relatively short, but the sudden cliffhanger at the end was jarring for me. I enjoyed the game enough that I immediately searched to discover a release date for a sequel, only to find that disheartening news. So if you're already dying inside waiting for Half-Life 3, don't torture yourself any further by adding something else to your waiting list. If you're okay with (at least for now) having to imagine for yourself what happens to the world of Avalon after your final discussion with Oberon, buy away. But I would advise looking to catch this title on at least 50% off.\n\nTL;DR: Solid game if you're into faeries and turn-based RPGs, but the ending is a cliffhanger for a sequel that will probably never come. Buy it on sale if you're okay with that.","January 1, 2015","false","16.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I do sometimes, and this game has captured something of the feel of the weightlessness and mobility of that dream. I could play for at least a few hours enjoying the twisting and turning of being a leaf on the wind.\n\nIt also has a pirate ship sequence that can't help but make me feel like I'm Tinkerbell in a Peter Pan play. And that is simply fun.\n\nI also think the music is soothing, just the kind of thing I want to listen to when I'm flying around.\n\nThe leveling system is unique. You gain various faery attributes as you level up, choosing between different sets of wings or tattoos that give you different abilities. It was entertaining.\n\nNow to the middling qualities of the game:\n\nIn terms of RPG plotting, this is pretty much baby's first adventure. If you're looking for something to get younger children into gaming, this might do it. There's not anything really scarey, no one is permanently killed even when they're defeated in battle, and the game usually offers two solutions: one that is peaceful and one that is a straight up battle. It also provides a scenario in which there are no good options. You will either need to fight or lie to get what you want. So I give it some credit for a level of moral complexity.\n\nIt was not a difficult game. I think I used a light healing potion 5 times total. There's no way to adjust the difficulty.\n\nIt uses a combat system very similar to JRPGs.\n\nThe bad:\n\nIt was unvoiced.\n\nIt required a lot of wandering around talking to people asking if they had heard of any of the parts of the solution to the puzzles. If it were a walking game, I'd call it a walking simulator. Fortunately, the flying improves this situation.\n\nIt's short. Though I give them credit that the $9.99 price is fair for what you get, and if you wait for a Steam Sale you can usually get a bargain at under $3.00.\n\nIn the end, I'm glad I bought it. It was enjoyable, and I'll probably play it again some time because of the flying and the leveling system.

I recommend it because I enjoyed playing it mostly, it is cheap and quiet unique.\n\nDetails: 100% playthrough in around 6 hours. All achievements can be easily gotten off the game.\nYou're playing a flying fairy and get around four worlds where you do some item-hunting quests, find companions, solve problems and plunder treasure chests. There are some turn-based battles encountered.\nSome Problems might be solved by either battle or item-hunting. Most quests require you to fly around and talk to the right person. Thankfully you are a fast flyer and traverse the small worlds in seconds.\n\nThe worlds and ideas are fairly original and worth exploring and that's the game's strong point. Flying around in games is good as are unique settings.\nBad points: some tedious quests, story ends on a cliffhanger and it is implied that the rest was cut so there'll never be a resolution to the story. (notice the number of standing mirror portals) Fighting is somewhat boring but multiple companions to choose from and few battles in total counter that.\n\nSome monsters might be too scary for young kids to play.

It's somewhat basic for the approved age range (12+) and would really be suited to under 10s, as a "my first video game" offering, but as nit contains killing, they can't get away with a lower age approval.  Tough!  The charming graphics would make it ideal as a starter game.  It's a bit clumsy at first until you learn how to zip through the dialogue, which is all text and needs to be read, and isn't in a large, clear font, so some straining is inevitable.  It has elements of RPG in that you interect and have some minor choices of action and dialogue and you get to level up and select attack styles, but the combat is turn-based, like Might and Magic, so it really just a game of hit-point-numbers when you get right down to it.  The music becomes infuriating after a short while so playing in silence is advised.  Like many games, you need to play a while and get into the storyline before it has a chance to draw you in...I'm, still waiting for that to happen.\n\nAdditional: now played for a while, and although it seems pleasant enough for young players, it's not truly drawing me in, as a seasoned player.  Seems to be fiddly and hair splitting where some of the fetch-and-carry quests are concerned.  I'll still leave the recommendation as I'm sure a lot of players out there don't have my depth of experience with games like this and might find it more of a draw.","September 24, 2015","true","5.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Unfortunately I am unable to do so because it does not work after the first load :(\n\nI purchased it on the 23rd Dec and played for about 90mins without issue. But when I attempted to play again the next day, it would not load. A quick Google search reveals several people have also had this issue in the past and suggest a problem with the driver. Re-installing this however caused registry errors which prevented my computar from restarting and had to be restored to factory settings (as the system restore would not work and nor would the laptop boot in safe mode).\n\nOn the plus side this means all software issues are gone and everything should be fine, right?

I reinstalled and again, it appeared fine and I played for about half an hour maximum before stopping but whe I attempted to play the game again (ninety minutes later max) it would not load.\n\nNo way am I touching any files again after losing three years of memories and I can hardly be expected to re-download every time I wish to play.

The flying mechanic is smooth and the combact isn't too challenging, whilst the customisation when levelling up adds a personal feel to the game that I like.

I do sometimes, and this game has captured something of the feel of the weightlessness and mobility of that dream. I could play for at least a few hours enjoying the twisting and turning of being a leaf on the wind.\n\nIt also has a pirate ship sequence that can't help but make me feel like I'm Tinkerbell in a Peter Pan play. And that is simply fun.\n\nI also think the music is soothing, just the kind of thing I want to listen to when I'm flying around.\n\nThe leveling system is unique. You gain various faery attributes as you level up, choosing between different sets of wings or tattoos that give you different abilities. It was entertaining.\n\nNow to the middling qualities of the game:\n\nIn terms of RPG plotting, this is pretty much baby's first adventure. If you're looking for something to get younger children into gaming, this might do it. There's not anything really scarey, no one is permanently killed even when they're defeated in battle, and the game usually offers two solutions: one that is peaceful and one that is a straight up battle. It also provides a scenario in which there are no good options. You will either need to fight or lie to get what you want. So I give it some credit for a level of moral complexity.\n\nIt was not a difficult game. I think I used a light healing potion 5 times total. There's no way to adjust the difficulty.\n\nIt uses a combat system very similar to JRPGs.\n\nThe bad:\n\nIt was unvoiced.\n\nIt required a lot of wandering around talking to people asking if they had heard of any of the parts of the solution to the puzzles. If it were a walking game, I'd call it a walking simulator. Fortunately, the flying improves this situation.\n\nIt's short. Though I give them credit that the $9.99 price is fair for what you get, and if you wait for a Steam Sale you can usually get a bargain at under $3.00.\n\nIn the end, I'm glad I bought it. It was enjoyable, and I'll probably play it again some time because of the flying and the leveling system. But if you're looking for something serious or challenging, look elsewhere.","September 16, 2015","true","12.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However it does have some unique features that made me really enjoy it and lament that there will never be a continuation of the story:\n\n-Unique concept.\n-You can FLY! Really fast too. Never seen this in an rpg before.\n-When you level up you give your character new abilities and upgrade them by changing their appearance. For example, if you give them butterfly wings you get a lightning spell, a scorpion tail and you get a poison attack, etc.","September 10, 2015","true","12.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

The combat isn't difficult and the art and music is very nice.  A relaxing, casual RPG and the "upgrade your faerie character" is pretty neat.  Story is good, especially if you have some interest in / familiarity with myths and legends.  The puzzles are fine and the characters are well done.  Would have been better with voice acting - didn't realize how much I would miss that.\n\nI recommend this for when you need a break from the length and scope of Skyrim, Witcher etc.  Maybe not worth full price, since the concluding chapters were never finished, but an enjoyable way to spend a few hours.\n\nI must agree with the comments that there is a lot of potential but not enough depth to the game - everything has a feel of being almost but not quite finished.  I still say it's a "recommend" though, because what was there was well done.","June 15, 2015","true","21.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Characters, even if the interaction was limited, they still felt great and were properly developed. Combat was fast, yet simple, increasing your stats via leveling up, was interesting, I liked the idea of visual upgrades. In the end, it is a good game, worth playing, though a shame the other two games, it was meant to be a trilogy, haven’t come out yet, and I can only hope they will eventually be released.","August 6, 2015","true","9.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Unfortunately I am unable to do so because it does not work after the first load :(\n\nI purchased it on the 23rd Dec and played for about 90mins without issue. But when I attempted to play again the next day, it would not load. A quick Google search reveals several people have also had this issue in the past and suggest a problem with the driver. Re-installing this however caused registry errors which prevented my computar from restarting and had to be restored to factory settings (as the system restore would not work and nor would the laptop boot in safe mode).\n\nOn the plus side this means all software issues are gone and everything should be fine, right? Sadly not. I reinstalled and again, it appeared fine and I played for about half an hour maximum before stopping but whe I attempted to play the game again (ninety minutes later max) it would not load.\n\nNo way am I touching any files again after losing three years of memories and I can hardly be expected to re-download every time I wish to play. My gf has contacted the publisher today but obviously am awaiting a response.\n\nFrom what I was able to play of the game, as I said, it seems really fun. The flying mechanic is smooth and the combact isn't too challenging, whilst the customisation when levelling up adds a personal feel to the game that I like. My gf wants it on PS3 so if that version has no issues then perhaps I can enjoy this after all. But for now, I'd suggest people be cautious of the Steam version in case you have the same issue as I (and if you don't then I am very jealous).","December 25, 2015","false","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
