The idea is that it's an open world crime game like GTA, but it's set in video game land filled with parodies of almost any video game character you can imagine. It's a brilliant idea, and fortunately the game mostly lives up to this great concept even if it falls short in some areas.\n\nThe game plays as you'd expect out of an open world crime game. However, the game tries to have a much better variety of mission styles. It doesn't try to be only standard A to B shooting. The game tries to mix it up by including missions that are arcade-like or based on old NES games. Thanks to this the variety is incredible and every other mission mixes up the gameplay in some way, so you'll rarely get bored. The quality of the missions do vary however. A good amount of the missions are fun and challenging, but others tend to be a little shallow and funnled, not leaving a lot of room for experimentation. On the whole though, the biggest problem with the missions in this game is that they're all a bit short.\n\nThe pacing of the whole game is crazy fast, so it's a very quick experience and missions end quite fast sometimes. Unfortunately this leads to my biggest problem with the game; the main campaign is not very long. You can try to take it slow and try not to rush through, but the game is so fun you won't want to stop. It isn't criminally short though, it can last to about 6-7 hours. Just don't expect a 15-20 hour long campaign. The game offers a challenge and it gets really brutal at times. Don't get me wrong the game is not unbeatable, it's just some of the levels do not hold back on challenge, so there is a good amount of authentic NES-style difficulty. Expect to get a bit frustrated at times if you're not used to that kind of thing.\n\nThe game has a pacing problem narrative-wise as well. It seems like the game was supposed to have a somewhat deep storyline and characters but that aspect seems to have been scrapped before the game's release. So as a result, if you were looking for an engaging story, you'll be disappointed. It's extremely fast paced, and has a lot of unrelated events and characters you see once or twice then never again, there's just no focus. That doesn't mean it's horrible though, since it manages to be entertain and the humor is mostly well done. The characters are also interesting and there's always something new and amusing around the corner.\n\nThe parody aspect is extremely well done. Basically, the whole world of RCR is one big parody. The characters in it are cleverly de-branded counterparts of famous characters, and basically everything else is a reference to something from the 80's, the 90's, or sometimes the 2000's. The whole city you explore is chock full of parodies and pop-culture references, it's pretty fun to explore. However it's a little 'look but don't touch'. The city is just kind of....there. It's fun to look at, but it's not very interactive and you can't go into most of the buildings. The city is also a bit small as well which is a little disappointing, but understandable if there was not much dev time to spare or it couldn't be bigger due to the NES limitations, possibly both (yes, the game's engine has limitations very similar to the NES). The sprites are small as well which is kind of jarring in contrast with all the amazing pixel art in the game. They're not very detailed, but there is a zoom mode if you want them to be bigger. Just keep in mind that it doesn't make the sprites more detailed, it just makes them larger.\n\nThe music in this game is composed by 3 different guys including the legendary "virt" (Jake Kaufman), and they each have their own style. The soundtrack in this game is very, very good. It sounds extremely authentic, so it's almost as if they were ripped out of an actual old NES game. The only problem I have with the music is that during cutscenes, it switches between songs in a weird way. Like one shot shows something and there's a song in the background,  then when it changes to a different shot showing something else, it switches to a entirely different song that's completely unrelated to the previous song that was playing, so the cutscenes sound a bit weird at times. Also I know an in-game radio like in GTA is probably hard to code, but in this game you don't get a feeling that it's playing songs on other stations without you. So sometimes, it sounds like it starts playing the same song every time you switch to a certain station.\n\nOverall though, RCR is a very fun and unique game combining all the pop culture from the 80's and 90's into one game, so the nostalgia due to the sheer amount of references gets pretty intense. Also, the game has a lot of variety and and some genuinely good humor, so you'll rarely get bored during the short but sweet campaign. The game may have not truly lived up to it's great concept, but it was pretty damn close. I think there is a lot of potential for this concept, with just a few tweaks, a sequel to this game could possibly be one of the best indie games ever.\n\nEDIT: After some rethinking, I've decided to recommend this game. You have to keep in mind that I waited quite a while for this game, and it didn't live up to the extreme expectations I had, so I set myself up for disappointment. So at first it was more of a personal review instead of an objective one. So I changed it to be more objective and recommended the game. The game still has some hefty flaws, but it's still a fun romp no doubt.","December 3, 2013","true","31.9"," 245 of 323 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","245","323","0","0"

There are a few internet meme's strewn throughout and it's all very welcome in my books.\n\nThe retro game references are just superb though, with an entire section dedicated to the original TMNT NES cartridge among others, it's a blast to just experience the game as a whole.\n\nThe game had a lot of love put in to it, the music is incredible and I had to download the soundtrack afterwards and I still listen to it every once in a while.\n\nDefinitely worth a sale price purchase in the 10 to 15 dollar range.\n\nI can't say much about the controls as it basically plays like a slightly better version of the original top view GTA games (1 & 2) mixed with an 8-bit NES style. The map can get a bit convoluted and collectables are a bit annoying to find even with a guide because of the shoddy graphics but it's still do-able with some focus.\n\nThe thing is you'll either love it or hate it... and if the references can't save you because you're too young to understand it, then you should probably stay away because it's all about the references, not so much about the gameplay.","November 11, 2014","true","7.5"," 49 of 53 people (92%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","92","49","53","4","3"

Retro City Rampage is the incarnation of the 80s and 90s. Also the sound effects and music make you totally feel the 80s. This game is a MUST-HAVE for all those who grew up with such games and want to relive the old times. Through, if you’re one of the new age-kids where graphics are everything, you might want to pass.\n\nOnce you made it through the handful of training missions, the game opens up substantially, and you can keep both: the comedy and the action rolling at your own pace. Some of the comic moments are so thick that it can at first feel oppressive. Nobody will laugh at everything, BUT everybody will laugh at SOMETHING in this game!\n\nOf course you can keep attention to all missions but the most of your fun will consist of freeroaming the city and just raising hell! It’s easy to spend hours with it because the game always offers enough to keep you busy. For example whenever you start to kill people (with driving, shooting, punching or otherwise) the police will follow you and you get the feeling of a gangster on escape.\n\nI highly recommend this game. ♥","April 22, 2014","true","7.6"," 45 of 50 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","45","50","0","6"

Expect references to 80's movies, games, pop culture, and much more.  The gameplay itself is like a 2D, 8-bit version of the 3D Grand Theft Auto games, split between on foot combat, and vehicle segements.  There are 62 story missions, 23 weapons, and tons of vehicles.  The game has a pretty good difficulty curve starting very easy and building up to extremely difficult for the final sequence of story missions. The game is very generous with checkpoints so dying is almost never that big of a deal.  Aside from the main story there are 14 "sprees" and 23 "second rate sprees".  The sprees involve trying to get a high score while under various effects such as drunkeness, invulnerablity, explosive sweat, normal stuff.  There is one second rate spree for each weapon and they just involve killing as many people with that weapon as possible.   There are also 70 collectibles hidden around the game world (similar to the packages, magnets, oysters, etc. from the GTA games) along with plenty of other hidden easter-eggs giving plenty of reason to explore the game's overworld.  Overall the game was very fun, very funny, and highly recommended by me.","January 11, 2015","true","20.4"," 34 of 36 people (94%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","94","34","36","4","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/recommended/204630/","rockstarcro","RockstarCRO","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/","252 products in account","This game is a NES nostalgic dream. It isn't however, an NES game (just to make that clear)! It is a spoof of every game possible and it does a good job of synthesizing it together. Just get ready for both good and bad (lame) jokes.\n\nThe storyline follows a person named "The Player" in which he is essentially a thug for hire. A bank heist goes wrong and The Player ends up stealing a time machine which flings him years forward. Doc Choc (another spinoff of a well known persona) comes in to help The Player recover pieces of the machine to get him back to where he belongs.The gameplay is like the first version of GTA. You are able to move in 9 directions and shoot relatively to your position. Weapons are in abundance and in variety from golf clubs to shotguns to the bionic commando arm. Why is there? Why not... why not. There will be situations where you will need specific weapons to accomplish certain tasks. I prefer to use the shotgun over automatics when it comes to being overwhelmed by a lot of characters. The player can choose to free-roam the city or do main missions or side-quests. The game is really over-the-top with everything it does and isn't scared to loosely knock off and ridicule other games.\n\nAny car (or bicycle or motorcycle) can be stolen. Some cars can be modified to be given a jet engine at the back or some kind of armaments. The more you progress in the game, more modifiers become available. If you do happen to break the law, cops will chase you if you break but it isn't as tedious as the GTA series. To get the police off your back, the player needs to find a special police token that will rid them of their wanted level. This token appears randomly in areas or can be dropped by eliminating a certain amount of police forces. In addition to modding cars, the player may mod themselves as they please. Again, progressing through the story will unlock more styles. There isn't much the player can change but hair is definitely one of them as cut-scenes will show "The Players" face. Throughout the game, there are power-ups that can be picked up to give the Player some neat abilities. These abilities can come in the form of speed or in some obscene form such as a Super Mario cape allowing your character to fly.\n\nThe graphics are quite basic and provide basic 8-bit fun. If graphics are imperative to you, this might bug you. Although the graphics are simplistic, it seems that the smallest of details were paid attention to. Sure, it is a simple color with a simple outline but the thought of including as much as one can is appreciated. The sounds follow a NES scheme. The music station can be changed (there are about 10 stations to choose from) and the sounds are appropriate for the setting. Don't expect to hear triple A explosions but you'll definitely hear everything going on in the game.\n\nI like this game. I personally bought it on it's lowest sale price and do find the price slightly steep. If you do like this though it might be worth the purchase for you. It's good, it entertains, but doesn't try to attempt to break away from traditional gaming. I would have loved to see the game take a bit more risks with it's gameplay.\n\n\n\nRATING : 7.25/10.\n\n\n\nGameplay	B	Story / Campaign	B+	Visuals / User Interface	B-	Sounds / Music	B-	Replay-ability	C+	Overall 	B-\n\nScreenShots :\nThe bosses or enemies look vaguely familiar....\n\nCasually strolling through the streets with a rocket launcher... feels like GTA 1\n\nAn example of in-game humor.

I love this game. I can’t even write from an objective standpoint here to make an honest and fair review with this one. I’ve spent over 20 hours with this game here on steam, gotten every achievement- and even then- I didn’t quit. I took the time to Gold Medal all the optional missions too. I seriously can’t get enough. I tried for hours to put my name up on the leaderboards. I’m in the top 20 for lots of the missions and I’m quite proud of that. But enough about me.\n\nSince I can’t really come at this from an unbiased angle I’ll just try to explain what’s it like. It's a retro-inspired Grand Theft Auto-esque homage to everything that was popular before I was born- and I can definitely respect that. I grew up watching movies and playing the games of the 80s- even though I was born in '95- just because of the way my parents were. It’s a top down shooter in some ways- a bit like Smash T.V. (a game which is actually referenced in a rather obvious level) The game is indeed open world- and has the very same mission based structure you’d come to expect from an open world experience. The cars in it drive in a couple different ways. One is akin to an RC car (a bit like R.C. Pro-A.M) and the other is one of those “Drive in the direction you press” things. Oddly- I usually prefer the latter- but mostly because I find it more precise. The story is goofy and out there- but fitting for the game. And there’s even a few cameos of a few other popular indie games.\n\nThis is the kind of game that you might be skeptical of when you see it in action- but when you actually play it you’ll see what makes it appealing- surely. Whether or not you’ll like it is entirely subjective in this case- but if you have an interest in retro games or games that resemble the kind of gameplay you find in Grand Theft Auto- you’ll at the very least get a kick out of it. If you grew up in the 80’s with the games and movies of that decade- I’d almost universally recommend it.\n\nI can’t imagine a situation where someone will buy this game and feel entirely disappointed. I’d imagine you’d want to pick it up during a sale- as with most things on steam- but I feel the game is entirely worth the full price. Especially if you want to support the developer- who’s a pretty awesome guy by the way.\n\nI can’t wait to see what Brian Provinciano has up his sleeves for the future.","January 4, 2015","true","28.3"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","16","18","2","3"

There are even arcade machines you can play within the game as fun little minigames. Also included, are tons of skins for the game.

The cameos are pretty cool, but it's just not enough to spike your interest for too long.\n\nI won't say I don't recommend it though. It's a cheap game that'll kill an hour or two when you're bored.

Lots of vibrant colors and detailed areas to enjoy.  And the cutscenes are well drawn and fit the feel of the game.  Nothing much to complain about here.\n\nSound:\n8-bit sounds all the way!  From the sirens and gunsfire to the music, it's all 8-bit bliss.  Much of the music is also nice to listen to, but you have the option to shut it off it it's not your thing.  The game also has options for different filters and boarders to make it feel like you're playing it on an old tv back in the day, scanlines and all.  Some of the colors filters, while nice options, can hurt the eyes after a bit.\n\nControl:\nYou can use keyboard/mouse or controller, but controller is HIGHLY reccomended.  Controls are a bit of an issue, as the default keybinds feel weird and rebinding them is dificult.  Once you get past that though, the game plays fine and control is responsive.\n\nGameplay:\nThis games, despite the cartoony look, retro graphics, and hilarious story, is still a GTA clone at heart.   You can mug people on the strees, collect weapons and carjack people.  There are paint shops and pickups to lose the heat, and shops to buy skins and weapons.  But you also get a few tricks that GTA doesn't, like speed boots, the ability to jump on enemies, add weapons to your cars, and even a time machine!  The wackiness really sets this game apart from GTA!  The story is also a full on omage to old retro games!  The game's missions doubly so!  You even have to go visit an imfamous dam from a certain turtles game!  The only issue I have is that some of the missions are QUITE long and due to random difficulty spikes, will often take more than an hour to complete, and repsawns during the mission are unforgiving.  I have ragequitted a few times because of this.  Still, this fact does not limit the overall fun factor of the game.\n\nI recommend this game to anyone who has or had enjoyed a GTA game, but want something more light-hearted and crazy!","January 14, 2015","true","11.1"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","11","14","0","2"

I really, really do. But it just has massive glaring flaws, that keep it from actually being fun to play.\n\nWhen the game starts, it's funny. The intro manages to both parody AND lampshade the Megaman 2 intro, and pretty much 90% of the intro level is a parody of the beginning of The Dark Knight Rises, and a well done one at that. Then you step into the gameplay, and it's actually fun. Yeah, it can be tedious at times, but it IS fun. Then, after about the third mission, the problems start.\n\nThe first one is honestly one of the bigger problems: The game doesn't understand when there's been ENOUGH refrences. You can't go two seconds without a reference, and while it's fine at first, by the end of it, it's gotten EXTREMELY annoying.\n\nThe second one is more of a deterrent to the experience: The random gameplay changes are not implemented well. Why is the final battle a chase with crappy hit detection? Why do you have to run over people in a car that might as well be made of paper? Why do you have to stealth with stealth mechanics that DON'T WORK?!?!?\n\nAnd finally, the game seems to expect you to be perfect in the later stages. Narrow hallways with enemies with rocket launchers that can kill you in one hit if you don't have a full lifebar? Check. Throwing 15+ of said enemies at you in one room? Check. Massive Zerg Rushes of Enemies with guns when all you've been given is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ melee weapon?\n\nMASSIVE ♥♥♥♥ING CHECK.\n\nAll in all, this is one of those games that, while i'm glad i bought it, if only to learn about it, i honestly would've been ♥♥♥♥♥♥ if i had bought it at full price.

The gameplay is simple and addictive, with high replay value.\nThe game is nearly 100% a reference/parody of the 80's (including Back to the Future, Ghostbusters and TMNT) or popular NES games at any time (including Mario, Mega Man, and Rad Racer). It's very charming and doesn't take itself too seriously.\nOne of the coolest features is the graphical options. You can change your "television" to several different sets, including an arcade cabinet or a Gameboy. You can also change the color settings to look like an NES, Super NES, Sega Genesis, Atari 2600, Gameboy, and many more. You can even turn on scan-lines for an authentic 80's CRT TV experience.\nMy only gripes with this game are particular levels. The underwater levels are overly difficult and frustrating.\nAnother level pits you against several rocket launcher-wielding goons with little to fight back with; defeating them is pure dumb luck.\nThe final boss fight is initially interesting and stylish, but quickly becomes overly difficult and unfair.\nOther than these few issues, the game is incredibly fun and I would reccomend it to anyone.\n8/10","June 27, 2014","true","5.9"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Good.)\nRetro City Rampage is a pretty straight forward title. It's retro, takes place in a city, and you rampage. This is the game, a majority of the game. Visually, the game hits the mark spot on, colors and and sound design truly do evoke the right feeling. The missions aren't particularly fun, mainly consisting of "A to B while C, then return to A", or "Fill Quota of X" missions. It's an open world, and you can drive. The primary issue with this game is it relies almost entirely on trying to tickle the nostalgia part of your brain and reference things from the 80's. Do you like that? If you do, you might like this game. And in fact, some of the jokes and pokes are humorous, but it feels oversaturated. There's nothing wrong with being an 8-bit style game. But in Retro City Rampage, when you strip away the cheesy reference humor and the old school aesthetic, I feel that you'll find that there's not much worthwhile beyond that.","June 2, 2015","false","2.1"," 32 of 57 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","32","57","0","3"

I had so much fun with it, that I thought I would buy it again when it went on sale for Steam(and all of the udpates that are included)\nThis game is a throwback to the "good ol days" of NES. From the creator of the NES rom homebrew "Rom City Rampage"\n\nHe took the idea for the Rom Homebrew "Rom City Rampage" and built on it ten fold...The result is a HUGE sandbox retro styled 8 bit GTA type game. The gameplay is solid and the ENTIRE game is filled with all sorts of great 80's and 90's pop culture references/parodies. Movies, TV, Video games. You name it. Heck, in the opening gameplay/tutorial there are at least 10 great video game references that most gamers will recognize right away. They come fast, so keep your eyes peeled!\n\nThis game has COUNTLESS HOURS of great gameplay. There are plenty of side missions, minigames, and badge/high score runs that you will never get bored. That doesn't even include the storyline missions that are required to "beat" the game. Tons of vehicles, enemies and "outfits" for you to mess around with.\n\nI am impressed with how perfectly the developer made the game play and feel like an 8 bit game, yet made sure that the game plays flawlessly.\n\nIf you are a fan of GTA, retro games or just fun 80's and 90's pop culture I HIGHLY recommend you purchasing this game. There's NO excuse no to. It's worth every penny.","February 13, 2014","true","8.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","3"

I'm impressed that something like this is able to have a lot of variety and not end up really collapsing in on itself. The mechanics themselves are not perfect but okay, doing that thing where misguided nostalgia brings back terrible gameplay elements and mechanics instead of doing the right thing and leaving them in the attic.\n\nThe references ground my gears more than the gameplay. The combined weight of all the references and cameos is like Neil Cicierega having a stroke and turning the Ultimate Showdown of Ultimate Destiny from a five minute song into a ten hour long old-style Greek epic. And when that isn't irritating enough, it brings out the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ self-parodies of other games!\n\nThe real recommendation here is the developer. Brian Proviciano is a Carmack level magician who fiddles around with ancient hardware and creates 100%-hardware accurate ports of this game in Assembly. The game itself accomodates to every level and flavor of nostalgia. You can even play the game in EGA or on a simulated Game Boy screen, for crying out loud! You can even play the aformentioned NES port of this game inside the actual game! That's bonkers as hell. Brian needs his John Romero to make the most of his talents and create something truly amazing.","August 25, 2013","true","7.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/frazr_lzer/recommended/204630/","frazr_lzer","viad","http://steamcommunity.com/id/frazr_lzer/","164 products in account","Retro City Rampage is what you get when you combine a modern open world game with retro 8 bit gameplay and style. Oh, and with loads of pop culture and video game references. This combination of different gameplay and style works well, playing out like an 8 bit version of GTA and similar games with plenty of humor and parodies going on.\n\nThe story revolves around Player, the main character of the game, who is a henchman. After stealing a time traveling phone booth that takes him into the year 20XX, Player must work with Doc Choc to fix the time machine and also interact with other characters in Theftopolis to get the needed parts. In the game, the story is driven through missions and cutscenes. Along with the main missions for the story are optional side missions that provide extra narrative based on the main plot.\nThe game uses a lot of parodies and references throughout as seen with the characters and scenery, to name a few. With the sheer amount of references going left and right, it’s easy to be overwhelmed, but the parodies are a good laugh with a focus on video games and 80s and 90s pop culture. The references range from mainstream to obscure and subtle to blunt, and it’s a great experience keeping with the game’s theme and setting. The majority of the references lie in Story Mode, which really drives not just the parodies but also the overall style of the game.\n\nRetro City Rampage plays much like a cross between open world games like Grand Theft Auto with some gameplay style from NES games. Like in most open world games, there is a big city to explore and missions pointing you to certain locations. The majority of missions focus on getting to a certain spot on the map and doing a certain task. There’s a great variety of different tasks to do, making the Story Mode missions interesting with different gameplay goals to complete. In addition to the structured missions that show each objective to be done, there are also arcade style missions with the goal being to get a high score. These arcade missions are quite fun in their own right, focusing instead on pure mayhem and causing as much destruction in the city.\nAs the gameplay borrows from GTA, there are some common elements in Retro City Rampage. Cars can be stolen, pedestrians can be attacked, police will attack upon seeing a crime, and there are a variety of weapons to use.  The game does deviate from typical open world games by bringing its own twist based on games from the 8 bit era. Jumping is performed like in platforming games with the intent to jump over obstacles and to jump on people’s heads. This jump attack can kill people and is a powerful unarmed attack. Objects and people can be picked up and thrown in a manner similar to beat em up games, where any object is carried over the head and thrown forward. Powerups can bestow different effects. These powerups must be bought unless a mission gives one that must be used, and they give a huge amount of power in a limited time.\nIn addition, the game is quite fair when it comes to trying to complete missions. After dying in a mission a few times, the game will offer some useful tips pertaining to that mission. If the game feels that the mission is quite tough for the person playing based on the many deaths that occurred, the game may change things around by giving a handicap to help complete the mission. This function of making the missions a tad bit easier is not in every mission, so some particularly tough missions must be completed at the default difficulty. Anyhow, it’s clear to see the inspiration from open world games, but there’s also a great combination with gameplay from NES games that works well as a game that is fun to play.\n\nThis game employs an 8 bit pixel style, with a very sincere approach in imitating the style of actual games from that era. The graphics are quite blocky and low resolution in the overworld, as if the game were on the NES. Character portraits are also similar in style, along with capturing the original character or person’s features from the parody. Only a few modern graphical liberties are used, one of which is the wavy screen distortion effect. In addition to its 8 bit style, there are various screen borders that slightly affect the presentation of the game, either by placing high resolution graphical borders that fit the game’s theme to even changing the colors of the game. With the 8 bit NES art style, the game treats the graphics quite well. It’s the same way that the parodies are treated with respect toward the original material, and the game goes great lengths into accurately portraying visuals as if it were an actual NES game with great results.\n\nThe music in the soundtrack is chiptune like the style of the game. There are some nice tunes played throughout, with the soundtrack being done by various video game musicians. Each of the songs work very well with the tone and style of the game, with a few parodies too based on some popular NES tunes. Overall, the soundtrack is quite catchy and stays true to the general theme quite well.\nOf note is the sound design, which is done like the sounds of the NES. All the sounds are not realistic and instead go for the beepy electronic noises that were a mainstay of games in the 80s. This design choice perfectly matches what the game was going for, with almost every aspect of the game being lifted from an NES game from its original time. There are only a few unique things seen in modern games that this game uses, but Retro City Rampage does so well in staying true to the original retro video game style.\n\nRetro City Rampage is in essence, an 8 bit version of open world games like GTA with lots of parodies here and there. The story is quite straightforward with the majority of parodies going there for a good laugh. The gameplay draws from GTA the most but throws in some gameplay style from NES games too. To top it off, both the art and music stay close to the style of the NES and holds its origins in high regard. Retro City Rampage is a fun game to play and oozes with respect for retro video games.","May 3","true","8.5"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","1"

And now that it's been released I'm actually disappointed. Not because I enjoyed it so much, but because of the difficulty spikes that took away a lot of my enjoyment.\n\nThe graphics look sweet , there's a lot of passion in it. It's visible from the start. I also enjoyed the references to 80's games, shows and movies. All great stuff.\nSame goes for the music and sounds, nothing to complain here.\n\nThe missions, however, are a different story. Like any other game it starts off easy. Then suddenly missions become more difficult and even frustrating. And after that they somehow become eas(y)(ier) again. Wait, what ? There's no consistency here.\n\nI finished the game in 8 hours (which should've been 6-7), but if you want to buy and play everything I think you can add a few hours to that number.\n\nA decent game, nothing more, nothing less.

There are so many 80's elements in this game and while the game pays homage to those 80's franchises, its done in a parody like way.  The TMNT parody stuff is highly amusing, and then the A-Tem show up, and you'll come across the Burton verison of Batman which at the same time pays homage to the old campy tv series, and there are even some 90's elements like the moments where the game mocks Saved by the Bell.  As for the main bad guy, the developer seemed to base him off the corrupt boss in Warrant's old music videos from their Dirty Rotten era.  But like I said, there are a lot of 80's elements and Back to the Future is one o fthe big ones.\n\nIn short, this game has retro NES graphics, and plays like one of the original GTA games but is chock full of 80's and some 90's satire and tht makes it totally worth getting if one is an 80's/90's junkie.  Th elead character, despite being an 8 bit character, is also pretty amusing.\n\nIn short, I highly recommend this game to my fellow gen x'ers who grew up watching all of those 80's films and are into violent games that are violent in an amusing way.\n\n","May 16","true","11.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

With heavy influence from the Destructoid crew (back when Jim Sterling was involved), this game features an abundance of weapon types, game and player modifications, and humorous themes. Apart from the content I would like to feature in the exposition of this review, a very noteworthy act by the creators of Retro City Rampage was the free update involving the Director’s Cut (DX) edition, which was supplemented to each other platform as well as Steam.\nHere are just a few reasons to give this game a try:\n\nOpen World - Similar to the first two Grand Theft Auto titles, Retro City Rampage DX utilizes a top-down open-world approach, which permits the exploration of the vast overworld on foot or with one of the game’s many unique vehicles. Within this sandbox are varying side missions, shops, secrets (featured later), a primary story arch, and non-player characters which stride throughout the area with their own agendas. Seeing as though the Player can wreak havoc in many different ways with both a large inventory of weapons and objects as well as utilizing vehicle collisions, police pursue the same principles as they would in early Grand Theft Auto titles: kill the Player. Apart from this perspective, the actual missions within the world are quite enjoyable; the primary quest-line advances the story and side quests typically give the Player access to unique equipment, vehicles, and services.\n\nFree Roaming Mode - When the Player wishes to experience the sandbox action to Retro City Rampage DX without having to focus on missions appearing on the mini-map and the loss of money as a death penalty, Free Roaming mode is always available from the Main Menu. Though some of the features are not accessible as they would be through the main game-such as completing various missions-, Free Roam spawns the Player with nearly every weapon available and practically pats you on the head while saying, “Go have fun!” There is absolutely not penalty for death-with a life tracker humorously tracing the Player’s deaths in the negatives-but the same overworld ‘police chase you if you do something bad’ theme still applies.\n\nHumor - Retro City Rampage DX features references mostly from 1980s popular culture such as Yoshi from the Super Mario Brothers and pop icon Michael Jackson, and presents these fairly bluntly throughout the territory. One instance would be a useable Warp Pipe-originally seen in the Super Mario Brothers franchise-which takes the Player to a run-down sewer system that presents themes from other titles such as Pitfall. Somewhat subtle remark placements, however, can be viewed in the game, though it does help to know or have heard of at least some icons from the 1980s to understand these.\n\nSecrets - I prefer to allow Players to delve into this item on their own terms, but Retro City Rampage DX retains its 1980s gaming feel by packing secrets all over the map, with both simple and complex means in which to attain and discover them. There is an array of enjoyable hidden content within this game, from unlockable Player skins to special objects. Keep an eye out! My word of advice: write down those codes; you will know what I mean.\n\nTL:DR - Though simple, Retro City Rampage DX is a highly enjoyable title that melds traditional themes with a ton of awesome gameplay mechanics. I do apologize for not writing much about this game in comparison to other titles, but I must admit that this one is one of my favorites regardless. I highly recommend giving this game a try; this is not a high-budget AA title, but its charm alone is what makes this game so engaging, with gameplay that entices the Player to continue the trek.

Even if it does use "8-bit" as its chief aesthetic, since that's apparently "the big thing" amongst indie devs.\n\nThe difficulty works too. Its difficult but not flatout "f*** you" hard like most. There's a nice amount of customization options too including screen borders homaging old Arcade bezels and the Game Boy's old ♥♥♥ sepia screen.\n\nPlus its a near-recoloured Claude from GTA3 and a hilarious ripoff of Doc Brown trying to stop a Potara fusion Doctor Robotnik/Wily from takin gover the world.

Mullets and spread guns run rampant in Theftropolis. There's even a car that runs on running over pedestrians. Pretty neat. It all comes in an appealing 8-bit art style.\nAfter the original insanity subsides, you will find plenty of fun missions, almost all of which are based on classic NES games. A great buy for anyone who played Zelda, Contra, Bionic Commando or Mario and wanted it to be overhead and open-world. For those new to gaming or that have only played recent releases, there are recognizable unlockable characters like Meat Boy, CommanderVideo, and even Steve from Minecraft.

So what is this game exactly? Well it's exactly what it says it is. A 8-bit open world with a nostalgia feel to it, it really has a nice feel to the game. If Grand Theft Auto where made into a 8-bit graphic, with top down perspective, and some inapropriate humour then this is what you would expect from this game.\n\nGame PlayI really wasn't expecting this game to be as fun as it was. Although I have a few faults with the game play sid eof this game, overall it's rather impressive. As you would expect in any open world game there are quite a few missions to get through, and then there are side missions that may help you in  the actual missions later on. Some of the side missions are rather quite difficult, and the way that some of them are set out aren't really all that fun to play. After doing a few side missions I kind of just went on with the main story and left them out. They might've helped me in the main missions but I don't really think it would of all that much. As for the main missions, some of them where brutally difficult for me. The final boss wasn't really all what I thought it would be, moving from side to side and dodging whatevere that guy was shooting at you. I did rage a few times but beat it in the end. On a positive note, some of the missions where quite funny and simply just what  guy would do to waste time, for example there was a mission to waste time. So you get a hover suit and just bash people on the head instead of waiting. The characters where a little dull and boring, and the story really isn't ll that much, I basically knew what was going on almost all the time without the game telling me what to do. Get a sevral items for the Time Machine and then get back. Not really all that fun but kept me entertained with the decent missions to keep me playing. The game took me about 9 hours to complete, I still sometimes go on it just to run people over in a car and mess around.\nScore (Out Of 10): 7 - Some difficult missions and a dull story, but some really fun missions to play, general fun messing about in the overworld and some funny humour.\n\nGraphics/art styleThe game (if you haven't already noticed) has a 8-bit styled graphic to it which really works well with everything that happens in the game. Everything looks like you would be able to play it in a old school arcade machine. Although some of the animations are a little lazy, for example the cars don't really have any wheel animation on the ground. This can sometimes make it look like everything is just moving across the road with the wheels not running across the road. I'm not really sure what you could've done to solve that but it was kind of annoying  to see that sometimes for me. Other than that nothing else to complain about the game graphics wise.\nScore (Out Of 10): 9 - Really nice 8-bit graphics, but some lazy animations here and there.\n\nMusic & SoundThe music and sound for this game where both really good. The sounds for certain things weren't at all generic and really fit well with the 8-bit style of the game, the music also fits well with certain scenarios in the game. Whether you're killing a bunch of robots in a tower or just chilling along the road smashing everything in your path! The game really sets the music well.\nScore (Out Of 10): 10 - Some really fitting music and no generic sound effects throughout the game\n\nConclusionThis is probably one of my favourite 8-bit games on steam. With it's decent overworld map to mess about in, the music and sounds along with the awesome 8-bit graphics make it all feel like a pretty solid game. Do be prepaired though for some difficult missions that you might come across in the game that might leave you playing it for more than you want to. But some great humour and game play implemented into this game.\n\n\nFor more reviews on a wide range of games, go and follow Lot's O Giveaway's curator group here.","March 5","true","12.4"," 12 of 22 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","12","22","0","0"

It was originally an attempt to remake GTA3 for the NES console, and became it`s own project that was ported to the PC. The influences from that game are very clear, as are the other games the author sought to parody.\n\nThe game from intro screen to gameplay is pure NES. It replicates many of the problems that programmers had creating for that system, and in a lot of ways moves past them. The gameplay is modern, it runs at a very nice framerate and in general reminds me a lot of GTA2 in some odd way.\n\nIt is also riddled with references, it shoots them out almost as much as a bodily function.

It was originally an attempt to remake GTA3 for the NES console, and became it`s own project that was ported to the PC. The influences from that game are very clear, as are the other games the author sought to parody.\n\nThe game from intro screen to gameplay is pure NES. It replicates many of the problems that programmers had creating for that system, and in a lot of ways moves past them. The gameplay is modern, it runs at a very nice framerate and in general reminds me a lot of GTA2 in some odd way.\n\nIt is also riddled with references, it shoots them out almost as much as a bodily function. So if you like loaded action packed indie games that don`t take themselves seriously, I can`t recommend this game any more.","October 15, 2012","true","5.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's packed with references to other games and even game development.  The story is basically Back to the Future (and I'm sure it recognizes that) and a big scavenger hunt.  You do all of these missions for the Doc to help repair the time machine.  The first half of the game is just running around having fun.  Once you get to the second half though, it's no more fun and games.  The difficulty curve shoots up and the levels will take you a few tries (or a lot).  It became a trial and error type game, kind of like Hotline Miami.\n\nThe game is definitely worth a buy!  8/10","June 28, 2014","true","7.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In fact the whole game is full of references everywhere , some obvious , some more obscure which will only make sence if you have knowledge or even better experienced the shows or games they are making fun of.\n\nThe graphics are over the top retro 8'bits and many gameplay mechanics reminds me of the games of that era, packed in a GTA aspirated but of course over the top game-frame. The creator of this game used a lot of time to give you the feeling of playing those antiquated systems .\n\nThere are also many funny commentaries of the state of gaming both practical and moral which can even apply today. At one point the hero of the game regret one of his past transgressions, the other character listening to the "player" (yes the player's name in the game is "player", another pun) comments ironically that he should maybe stop routinely running over and killing innocent bystander while he is at it.\n\nThis is a funny comment on heroes in games (and medias generally) sometimes committing large scale genocide in order to "save the day".\n\nThe gameplay is actually ok and refreshingly diverse, but it's obvious the creator prioritized putting references and puns in almost every frames of the game. As a result, the game itself might feel too short and small, the city especially could have been a tad larger,  and I can understand the criticism. I still would recommend the game for the well done retro feeling , funny puns , especially but not only if you grew up in the 80's and 90's.\n\nIt's not very expensive to begin with but if you get a discount at some sales, it's really worth it as long as you have some interest in game culture and ready for a game that doesn't take itself very seriously.\n\n","December 23, 2014","true","20.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It also tries to do this while clumsily weilding about what they will assert is a very retro playstyle. The thing is, this ends up being a worst of both worlds scenario, strung with boring and repetitive combat scenarios spread across a pretty uninteresting city, with little motivating you to follow through with the dozens of side missions that show up on your radar. When I did try to do them, they felt like they were repeating the worst parts of the main campaign, which itself was largely juvenile in tone and design. They throw a million expendable cops, thugs, and soldiers your way, with a hundred invisible checkpoints and an infinite supply of lives so that you die a million times (97 by the end in my case) without losing a lot of progress. And I can't help but feel like that blind jab at "difficulty" is what they believed would make their game justifiable as "Nintendo Hard". RCR is less a game and more a hamfisted, halfhearted, and mostly unfunny collection of cheap references and gags.","March 15","false","5.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The missions all seemed very hard to complete and I gave up on it. However this new version seems to be a lot easier to play and to enjoy. Also the resolution on the sprites look a lot better. Before they were very hard to see. Its also got a lot of 80's references inside the game that I really enjoy. A fun and so far easy game to enjoy.\n\nOk so I got to the very end boss... The few levels before meeting the head boss were not up to the level of play I had expected thru the entire game sadly. Most are one hit kill=deaths. Their is an underwater where if you touch a gear you insta killed. Not to be out done on this insta kill. Also just a side note. I am tired of indie developers including insta kills in their games. TIRED OF THIS TREND.\n\nTheir is a mini boss fight inside of a building with gears and some chicks who have rockets that will push you into being insta killed. Then you have the mini boss who can also insta kill you. Sigh.\n\nI did manage to beat the mini boss. So then we come to the last boss. Ugh. Sigh. Head pounding on desk at this point. Your a car with machine guns. This is fine. Why do I have to get carpal tunnel syndrome hitting the fire button for every single shot??????? Thats right no continous fire button you have to press it for each and every shot. Ugh again and of course its not just and the boss on a road. Oh no its you and the boss and other cars and exploding canisters just for more fun. You get 5 chances however pressing the button each and every time to fire( the boss has a life bar that is almost as long as my arm) will cause your to develop carpal syndrome.\n\nI will say I enjoyed the game till the very end levels that still have me scratching my head over these insta kill levels. So their you have it. Is it worth your time? I would say it depends on how much it costs. I would say for the $10 dollars asking price. NO. Its way to expensive for the game price. On sale for under $5 dollars then yes.","July 7, 2015","true","7.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

In Retro City Rampage you play as the Player. He is a criminal that is trying to make it big in the city of Theftopolis, But when an accident happens player is sent back in time and must get back to the present. So hows the game ? Its pretty much an 8 bit GTA and its great. The game has many awesome things that will make you chuckle or will make you want to break youre Pc into Bits. The game is presented in a top down persective and is played in a sandbox style of gameplay. The game will let you explore the colourfull city of Theftopolis and its a big city with lots of stuff to do. Many missions are parodies of classic games like Metal Gear Solid, Paperboy and many more. Many missions have you to pick up some itmes for people and in the other missions you just shoot youre way through dozens of enemies. Now overall there are some problems that haunt thsi game. One of those problems the game is incredibly difficult and some missions are unforgiveble. Sometimes youre charecter can get stuck in the buildings and this game has a cover system that barely works. This game also has an amazing soundtrack to match the style of the game. Overall a really fun game and has many great moments and for the price its going for its one of the games you must own right now i give Retro City Rampage a 9/10","February 8, 2014","true","6.3"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Controls are extremely awkward even playing on a PS2 controller, gameplay is dull. One thing it has though is varied gameplay - there are many missions that reference other games. Unfortunately that's where it also fails, the game is a massive parody, everything is a parody of a parody. After the first few "heh"s it becomes over used. Then it tries to have some original content and you get explosive sweat man. Suffice to say, I didn't "get it". I grew up in the 80s on Paper Boy, TMNT, Skate or Die, Battletoads, Sonic, Mario.. I get the references, but I don't get why anyone would think this is fun.\n\nRetro City Rampage is like someone on a diet who remembers how awesome fast food was, then rolled out some dough, topped it with chocolate sauce, covered it with fried chicken, ice-cream, hotdog buns, skittles and Big Mac sauce and expect you to eat it - but don't worry guys, if it tastes bad it's just a parody of a pizza.\n\nCan think of many better things to spend $1 on.","May 11, 2014","false","15.2"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","0"

This is the perfect game for anyone that has ever played an 8bit game in their life to the newer generations that get to see how graphics do not mean sh*t when it comes to great content.

The positives:\n\n80’s and 90’s references are amusing.\nFree roam gameplay is really fun.\nChallenges and sprees are also great (although, getting gold in some of these is too hard).\nI absolutely love the retro style.\n\nHowever, there are many issues that really drag this game down:\n\nThe final boss, I gave up. I’m not going back. The last few levels were horribly designed, and were simply not fun.\nTMNT sewer levels were bad then, and RCR’s reiteration is also bad.\nWith regard to the story, don’t ask why, it’s not supposed to make sense. Why should I care about what’s going on, if the game is constantly telling me not to care.\n\nPerformance: no issues playing on PC or through the steam link. Throughout my gameplay I used an XB1 controller, and I did not encounter any issues.\n\nOverall, this game is a 2 out 5.

Retro City Rampage DX is a GTA-styled game (but with the old school topdown-view), plus all kinds of references from the eighties thrown in to it that you can renember. I'm just 13 years old, but there are quite a lot of refernces that even I know. For example, Bundy's Wedding Chapel is clearly a reference to Al Bundy from Married with Children. Doc Choc and that time traveling-phonebooth are just references to Doc Brown from Back to the Future and Bill & Ted's Phonebooth.  I like the retro graphics, and the fact that you can change the graphics to old monitor settings, like CGA, Monochrome, and EGA. It's not the best game ever, but the game is pretty cool. And, it's just fricking GTA without the violent blood splatters. And I love blood splatters and unnecessary violence! *sarcasm* I would recommend buying the game, though not through Steam itself. If you go to the official website [retrocityrampage.com] you can get the game for 10 bucks, the same price on Steam, but included with (of course!) the Steam-key for Retro City Rampage DX, an DRM-free version of Retro City Rampage DX, plus all of the soundtracks! But, if the game is 75% off, then why bother and just buy it from Steam. 8/10","March 21","true","11.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It takes a turn for the worst when you have to get coffee to "not fall asleep" which jolts the game speed to INSANE for every cup you buy during the chase. Then, SUDDENLY you get a prompt for "Get a car" with pointers blinking so fast it'll make your head spin, and by this time the game goes so fast it's the final stages of Life Force all over again - impossible to control. And with no Konami code to save you this time.\n\nThat's a recipe for some truly disastrous game design: Completely unable to handle the car you either crash into the car you're supposed to have some distance to, or alert the driver by crashing into other cars, or fall too far behind. In any case, you need to start the stage ALL OVER AGAIN, and I really can't see this being a fun challenge to overcome at all.\n\nSo, game started out well, but halts your progress indefintely by having mandatory impossible missions like mentioned above, and I can not recommend that kind of boring work to anyone who wants to have FUN with a game.","November 22, 2015","false","6.4"," 27 of 55 people (49%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","49","27","55","4","5"

However, if RCR is a must play for you i would HIGHLY recommend playing on console.\n\nRCR feels out of place on PC as it is constantly reminding you of its tedious and confusing key mapping; and even when you map the keys yourself, it still feels wrong. Different game mechanics, like the mario jump attack, do not work on keyboard, and as a PC gamer it pains me to see they did not put much time into thinking it through properly.\n\nIt is hard to give this game a 'no' recommendation. RCR is a game filled with lots of things to do, from playing retro arcade games, to playing a brutal version of Paperboy, and it constantly tells funny jokes hinting at other retro titles. But it just does not work on PC as it feels like too much of a console port.\n\nAlthough this game does have full controller support, i would recommend players play it on its true platform; that being the PlayStation 3. If a PS3 is not available then buy yourself a controller for PC and save yourself the tedious controls and clunky gameplay with a keyboard.","April 1, 2014","false","10.1"," 20 of 41 people (49%) found this review helpful","49","20","41","0","3"

Jumping is also difficult to aim correctly. It's probably better with a controller; haven't tried that myself.\n\nThe graphics are meh, although I understand that's the point. The arcade-like borders around the game come off as pointless to me, thankfully they can be disabled in the options menu easily.\n\nThe story is an excuse plot; acceptable for this sort of sandbox game, and of course allows you to run around a variety of enviroments parodying games of the era. However, again, if you weren't part of the era, most of the references will sail over your head.\n\nThe gameplay: run, jump, shoot, evade police, etc. The story missions may screw with that a bit, but only temporarily.\n\nFor the third time, don't bother unless you really, really know the era well.

With nods to practically every game and movie out there it seemed flowing with jokes, the colorful city reminded my of the original GTA.\n\nBut one I got down to actually playing I was sorely dissapointed.  The combat is basically win or die, with no health upgrades or body armor in the game you basically can only take a few hits before you die, and you will die a LOT!  Your character can't even swim!\n\nThe aiming system with the guns...confuses me to say the least, I really don't get the lock-on system.  The game features like, 10 melee weapons...all of which do as much damage as your first does, with the exception of the sword, and except for dying you can't get rid of a weapon you don't want.\n\nAs for the wanted system, it more or less works like GTA, and for a game that is supposed to be about rampaging it fills fast enough.  But it also sometimes fills for no reason at all, I was literally just sitting outside my house cycling through my melee weapons and the wanted system went to full red, a glitch I would assume...if it didn't happen again and again.\n\nI could go on and on, but basically they tried to make a nice little shoot-em up game with nods to every "oldie" game and movie, which by itself is a nice concept, but as an actual game this one blows...hard.","June 23, 2014","false","4.1"," 13 of 27 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","13","27","0","0"

This is not an in-depth review at all, but simply the thoughts I have about it at this point.\n\nI just can't seem to get into this game. The introduction to the game is hard to follow. It's like everything's on speed, and they tried to add as many retro references they could into as short a time as possible. The graphics are reminiscent of games of old, but the picture is so incredibly busy, it's hard to register what you're actually seeing. It doesn't help with all the achievement and unlock popup messages that seemingly constantly pop up on the already busy screen. Controls feel really awkward, and what you're supposed to do exactly isn't always clear.\n\nThe biggest issue for me though, is that it's not really any fun.

The fundamental game is really well built and is fun to play, but over time it just doesn't feel enjoyable.\n\nThis is strange since Retro City Rampage is full of unique content, and the game always keeps you doing different things.  The story mode is just an excuse to string you along from one referential set piece to the next, but what's interesting is that many references take the form of one-off gameplay homages rather than merely verbal shout-outs; I think that's rather novel—interacting with references to interactive things where the reference is the kind of interacting you do.  I don't think I've seen that before, and here is an entire game made out of it.  Also, it's rather remarkable to note how flexible the basic mechanics are as they reproduce the mechanics of other games without actually changing.\n\nSo this is a hugely impressive game in one regard, but I don't very much like playing it.

Most of the game is 30 second snippets of better games from the 80's.  Until you get to the end of the game when the levels go on FAR too long.  The difficulty balance is off too.  Again, most of the game is a cakewalk, you can ease through it with no effort.  Then you get to the last 10 levels or so (out of 64) and the game just becomes a bull ♥♥♥♥ sandwich.  The dam level of TMNT, for example, is considered one of the worst of the NES era.  So of course this game makes you do it twice.  Road Blaster is one of my favorite games of all time, but the end of the game forces you to do it 6 times, wrapping up with a boss that you can only beat with luck.  He has a specific pattern, but he "cheats" in that sometimes his missles go where you are going to be, not were you were when he fired them.  Sometimes, but not always.  It's a violation of the boss pattern and had me throwing my controller and screaming profanities by the end of the night.  The graphics are cute for about 5 minutes, then you realize you can't really tell what the hell is going on most of the time.

In reality, it's a parody that, like many other parodies, is only funny for a little bit.   It's a romp through nerd culture from the 1960's to present, primarily in the realm of video games and television.   This leaves a vast source of material to cover, and unfortunately, it makes the novice mistake of trying to hit on way too much at once.\n\nGameplay-wise, the game is so-so.  It plays like GTA 1 (the old one) but the best vehicle, from what I've seen, is the super-speed boots that let you run over people with the force of a speeding train.   There are early and wonderful nods to Doctor Who, Back To The Future, old-school Metal Gear, and many other games, movies and shows.   Unfortunately, they are wrapped in a plot that seems like Beavis and Butthead wrote it from a cartoon rehab center somewhere.   The parodies either drag on or are barely touched and then abandoned.  Eventually, you will lose interest in the plot and just tool around trying to make money (which is far too easy), and try to find new things to do.\n\nOne of my biggest gripes about this game really had to be the implementation of player-earned penalities.   It makes sense if you become a raging alcoholic, you turn into a fatass and nobody likes you (see the Fable series).   That's not how this works.  Instead, you wander into a "noodle shop" and buy mushrooms....and half of them hurt you.  One, especially at low levels, can kill you dead.   You can't tell by the names; it all seems like a good time.    Nintendo-hard choices of how to get digitally stoned make no sense, especially when you can die.  Even in the 80's, "Winners dont' use drugs" was about as far as any game took it before handing you a hero that pops painkillers and drinks liquor to heal themselves.\n\nI do like one little easter egg; your "home base" allows  you to play an old console video game.  That game is an alpha build of Retro City Rampage.   I'd love it if more games did this (how badass would GTA V be if you coudl play GTA 1 in the arcades?).   Try it, though.   When you feel how unpolished the alpha build was....and how the game feels pretty much exactly like that version....you'll want your money back.\n\nNot recommended unless it's free or 99c and you want some pixel games to go with your booze.","March 28, 2014","false","3.5"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

If you want to use a mouse like a normal person, then you still shoot fews seconds after releasing the buttons also if you are moving, you will be still moving in the same direction you started to move while shooting. Dunno how they screwed up like this.\n- Cops who always try to run over you are going to get on your nerves really quickly. It's possible to evade them, but still very annoying,\n- Challenges... Oh god... Some are really fun and interesting but there is this stupid thing when devs without thinking or trying themselves give a challenge with idiotic goals. For example sweat bomber challenge. It is a very fun challenge where you are just an exploding person who can propel himself with exploding and travel quickly. Goal for a golden medal - destroy 50 cars in 60s. You have to destroy 1 car every 1.2s. Sounds logical? Especially when cars appear based on rng? Really? 47 cars is my cap. Always at the last 5s cars disappear. It is not hard to destroy those cars, there are not enough cars even when you are flying non-stop.\n- Last mission... I was going to give this game a 6-7 out of 10 score but after that mission I am sticking with 4/10. Not going to spoil what stupidity went on there but Jesus... Now every time I remember this game, I want to puke. Yay.\n\nConclusion:\nDon't buy this game. Watch a let's play or walkthrough but don't waste any money on it. After finishing it, you will feel that you wasted ~10h of life for nothing. You will appreciate this game more if you won't be the one playing it.","August 28, 2015","false","10.5"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

A bit more perhaps?) but I hardly think I will play it again for long, if ever: the graphic is very nice, the music does it's job (until now it has been ok, not superb) but the game has some *very* serious issues with rithm and humor.\n\nHumor-wise, it looks like it has been written by a 9 years old, or a bunch of drunken nerds: citations, memes and other stuff *everywhere*, and without style. The authors tried the hardest to stack tons and tons of innuendo, winking at this brand, that superhero, etc, but they did it so just throwing stuff around wihout thought or respite.\n\nThere is no single line of text that's not a reference to something (a videogames trope, TV, other titles: you name it) and in the end, the result is just a confusing, boring mess. It's like hearing Jon Stewart in fast forward, without pauses between the jokes to enjoy them. And if you think it's cool, think again.\n\nSame problem goes with sory and rithm: the missions are rushed and everything seems to go way to fast. After the first 10 minutes you already start skiping dialogues (it's the usual bunch of so-so puns, random objectives, etc, so why care?) and after half an hour you find yourself in a grand theft auto city, but wihout much interest in exploring or doing much.\n\nThe story jumps from one place to the other without a logic, and the settings are good looking, but logically inconsistent: city -> military base (so far so good) -> underground hi-tech complex (ehm...) -> obstacles run in the same base (wtf?) ).\n\nMight be funny for nostalgic of for the kind of people that get all excited at *counting* references (loook! The ninja turtles!!! Look! It's robocop! Look! That's the car of the A-Team...).

Developed by one man, which is cool admittedly, it's basically a Parody of both GTA and other games released throughout the years, which is its only saving grace. The parodies are funny! Everything from Duke Nukem to TMNT to Back To The Future to even Jean-Claude Van Damne are parodied and each one managed to get either a chuckle or a nice laugh from me at times. But that's the games only saving grace\n\nThe rest of the game is clunky, monotonous, and down right boring. It's main issue is that it plays its trap card too early with it's tutorial mission. After that, the game just copies itself to the point where even the jokes are boring. What hampers the game even more are the controls. Now I hate saying that the controls can ruin any game (I'm able to look past bad controls if the game is fun), but WOW! These controls are both bad and clunky! Not only is it a pain to move and aim, but the driving is what REALLY kills the game. I get the point that it's supposed to be emulating the NES in terms of gameplay, but come on! Even the driving games on NES had better controls then this clunker! When it comes to the shooting, it's even worse. There is supposed to be a lock on mechanic, but it's one of the worst ones I dealt with. Whenever you are shooting, you lock on to any near by targets and all your shots go there. The issue is that you STAY locked on when you are shooting and you can't freely aim at other targets without ceasing your fire and then firing again. This is a major hindrance when you are in gun fights when are you want to do is aim at another target but you keep targeting other stuff that AREN'T YOUR TARGETS!\n\nSadly, I can not recommend this game what so ever. Not only does it fail in trying to be a good GTA clone, but it sadly fails in being a parody at times. It does make me mad though...when I first got this game, I loved it. But now, the more I play it, the less I love it and the more I get frustrated with it. Save your cash and skip this game.\n\nFINAL RATING: SKIP","March 2","false","4.4"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

I have mix feelings about this game. While I did enjoy some of the references it's somewhat distracting. Don't get me wrong, I like the reference to "Smash TV" as much as the next gamer, but if I want to play "Smash TV" I'll play "Smash TV".  In fact there are a lot of moments like that. Everytime they bring up those games it just made me wish I were playing the real thing instead. Without the attetion to detail or the at times humorous dialogue the game would be nothing more than your standard GTA clone (except not nearly as fun).

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/draculamarth/recommended/204630/","draculamarth","Suicide Squad is Awful","http://steamcommunity.com/id/draculamarth/","987 products in account","NOTE: Though my time on this game says 0.1. hours, I played this game on the 3DS to completion. This may affect some of the comments on controls, but everything else is accurate to pretty much any version\n\nRetro City Rampage ostensibly is an 80s homage/NES recreation of Grand Theft Auto. However, getting into the game, one will quickly realize that it's a dumping ground for pop culture references, with a game that cannot decide what the hell it wants to be.\n\n\nGraphics/Art\nUsually, faux-retro graphics is a kiss of death for indie games. Far too many developers use 8-bit homage as an excuse to make lazy pixel art. I am willing to excuse it in this instance considering that RCR was originally supposed to be an actual NES conversion of Grand Theft Auto. The character portraits are about what you'd expect from a higher-budget NES game, with the in-game art being fairly small\n\nSound Design\nThe music is good, but that's to be expected from Jake Kaufman. That said, he's done far better work for far better games (Check Shovel Knight, one of the few truly great retro throwbacks.) Not that you'd be able to hear the music unless you muted the sound effects, which is a very smart move because Retro City Rampage has some of the most ear-grating sound effects I've ever heard in a game. Every few seconds, there's digitized screeching, what's supposed to be sirens and constant white noise that is supposed to be gunshots.\n\nStory/Character-World Building/Dialogue\nOnce upon a time in the 2000s, there were two directors named Aaron Seltzer and Jason Friedberg. After being part of the staff for the popular Scary Movie series, they set out to make their own comedies, such as Epic Movie, Meet the Spartans and Disaster Movie. Everyone hated these movies, and deservedly so, because in lieu of making jokes about pop-culture, they would just reference the fact that it exists. Seltzer and Friedberg are now pariahs in Hollywood, because everyone hates them.\n\nWhat does this have to do with Retro City Rampage, you ask? Because I'm convinced that this game's writers' only comedic reference were Selzter and Friedberg movies. The game does not tell jokes. The game tells references. Technically, the whole plot of the game is an *ahem* "parody" of Back to the Future. The tone of the game is set right at the beginning, where within the span of about six minutes, the game references Mega Man 2, Duck Hunt, The Dark Knight, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, The A-Team, Contra, Mario Bros, Frogger, and Bill and Ted (or maybe it's Doctor Who.) See, the joke is that you probably recognize these things and they are there. The villain is literally Dr. Robotnik from Sonic the Hedgehog, except his name is Buttnick. There's a level where you go to a factory. The joke is that the robot is the Destructoid robot.  H I L A R I O U S.\n\nGameplay\nThe story mode will showcase several problems with the game\n1. There are several missions where you are faced with a ton of enemies, which showcases how bad the lock-on aiming is. It's inconsistent with when it wants to actually lock on.\n2. The game has knockback when you are damaged, which will frequently kill you in later stages\n3. The game will force you into random diversions, usually to show off another "parody." Want to ride a slow bike that can barely turn? No? Too bad! The developer remembered that Paperboy existed. Want to throw barrels at a wall and have to constantly douse yourself when you catch fire? It's a good thing that Tapper was a thing the developer knew about. How about having an automatic runner stage featuring a guy who can propel himself with his sweat? Don't know what the homage it, but you get it anyways! Then comes the last two stages. Now, in most video games, you would need to use all the skills you've learned in the game so far to the test but- hold the phone. The developer decided that for the final stages, the player should throw all their skills away and play freaking Outrun. I could excuse the arcade minigames because those were optional, but here, you are forced to play Outrun, while Dr. Robotnik fires missiles at you that are timed to hit you right when it's impossible to avoid them.\n\n\n\nGrade: D","May 14","false","0.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","1"

The plot is completely neglectable, as it simply doesn't make sense. It's repetitive and so are the missions and dialogues, that try to be really clever with the most teen and buttdick humour ever. I was enjoying the sillines of it all until I realised that the dialogues were skippable and not funny, and that everywhere I went it was a hassle because the police was, well, hassling you everywhere. Not only that, but towards mission 40, the combat spikes up so much that it's frustratingly difficult and unfair - particularly for such a basic and not-thought-through system. It's simply not funny or engaging, and too frustrating. As a whole, yes, it's a mildly clever statement "videogame plots never make sense and are over-the-top self-aggrandising rampages!!!". But you can do exactly that with a much cleverer writing, humour and mechanics. Also, this game should have lasted two hours top, and it goes on and on and on and on unnecesarily.

Well... no. The game isn't meant to be serious, that much is certain, but I think it takes it's self too unseriously. Everything happens without rhyme or reason and a bunch of references to older video games, movies, comics, you name it, are just tossed into things randomly. Much of the time too much stuff goes on at once and it's hard to wrap your head around everything. And a lot of the mechanics in the game such as cover shooting and driving are just plain bad. It's an average game so its fun to play in short bursts... but other than that I don't know.","December 13, 2012","true","0.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It is only 22 mb large on my system, available for practically all operating systems (I am playing on linux) and all consoles, the dev made even a DOS port. That it is dedication and I think the programming of this game is really really well done.\n\nI finally bought the game because of a discount on steam and found out that the gameplay is also really fun, most things just feel right. There is not as much to do in the open world as in the "real" GTA games. I have rushed through the story missions, which I just finished, so there are still a lot of "challenges" for me to try. The story is fun, does not take itself too serious, but it is not deep, moving or particularly smart. The game is a satire and lives from its parodies of  old school games like Mario, Zelda and such, so it is definetly an advantage if you know those, but if you don't, it is still fun.  Some missions are definitly not easy, but usually doable, at least after a couple of tries, especially because the DX version features in-game tips (thank you dev). However, I would really recommend to play this game with a gamepad, I have not tried the keyboard control yet but I cannot imagine that it would feel as good as a gamepad.\n\nSo if you like retro games, cool 8-bit graphics and music and running around an open world shooting everything and if you don't fear an occasional challenge, I am sure you will enjoy this game for about 10 hours at least. I have played it only for 7, but there are still many things I want to do.\n\nHowever, it is not a game that I will love in the same way as I love for example "Zelda: A Link to The Past" or "Cave Story". The world is not small, but it is also not deep, believable or full of charming characters, same as the flat main characters. A game can be a retro satire AND have a moving story with deep characters, as UNDERTALE proved. If you are looking retro game with a moving story, that might be more for you. However, the gameplay was definetly more fun in RCR, imo. I enjoyed it and will recommend it.","April 6","true","9.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zenksren/recommended/204630/","zenksren","Zenks Renway","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zenksren/","585 products in account","The game's too short and easy and the whole game after the 1st mission is just a bunch of random events revolving around copycat characters you couldn't care less about. 99% of the plot just rides the Back to the Future train and occasionally mocks soccermoms, the NES/80's references are all either used as a (weak) basis for story missions or appear in passing mention, like the devs were just ticking down a checklist of things to reference whilst they made this.\n\nThe BTTF ♥♥♥♥ in of itself is wasted anyway because nothing in the game world (if you bother exploring it before the 1st mission) actually changes even though you've supposedly time-travelled a number of years into the future/past(the game never makes it clear on which one it is which goes to show how little thought they put into it). Yup, they made the whole game a time-travel plot just to wax nostalgia over one freaking film that not everyone is going to have that sort of attachment to.\n\nMost of the side-content such as the challenges and mini-games are a joke and take almost no effort to get gold on. Most of the weapons are identical other than how much damage they do and apart from the speed shoes, the power-ups all feel like an after-thought the developers force you to use in certain missions in an attempt to get you to care about their existence.\n\nThe graphics, whilst I get are supposed to match the look of a NES game, are lazy- most of the game world looks the exact same despite being so small, the actual character sprites are ♥♥♥♥in microscopic and have almost no detail so everyone's basically a pallete-swap of each-other with the only distinguishing features being hair/hat. I understand this was originally supposed to be a homebrew NES game (EDIT: proto of said NES game is playable in the DX version, it's cute to look at... for about 5 seconds), but they really shot themselves in the foot in the graphics department by trying to make it "authentic", especially when I can think of God-knows how many actual NES games with better graphics than this.\n\nThe soundtrack is HUGE and there's a decent amount of variety but you barely get to hear any of the good tracks in the actual game unless you fiddle about with the radio stations cos they all play in the story missions which only last around 4-5 minutes at most cos, as I said, this game is too easy. Otherwise get used to listening to the same 3-4 songs throughout the game that get annoying really fast.\n\nFor a game that took 7 years to make and kept me waiting for almost 2 years after I first heard about this game before it came out, I was pretty damn disappointed. Buy it when it's on sale and you have about 6 hours to kill, otherwise if you want a good NES/80's parody game, play Abobo's Big Adventure for free on Newgrounds and stay the hell way from this.","April 26, 2014","false","6.7"," 10 of 22 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","10","22","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bondtravolta/recommended/204630/","bondtravolta","Bond of Travolta","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bondtravolta/","50 products in account","This game is a good example of why it's important to also check the negative reviews on a game that have a lot of positive reviews.\n\nAs many others have expressed, this game shoves parodies & references down your throat every single moment and that seems like all the game is good for and even then, it does get annoying especially if you're familiar with all those since it's like- where the hell is the new, fresh content we haven't seen & experienced before?\n\nThe dev can make an excuse saying it's meant to be a homage to retro games but I think that's cheap if it doesn't have much of it's own content & flair to back that up. I know it's a parody, but at this level it's just plain cheap reuse of existing  ideas & scenarios from other games put randomly in it. That said, it tries hard to be funny but you'd just get a few chuckle here & there. That said, newer gamers who hadn't played the games it's parodying would not get most of the joke and to me, that's bad since like a bad parody (either games, films, cartoons, etc.), it fails to make the joke happen for those unfamiliar with the source material.\n\nMoving on, even with the story, parodies & jokes aside, this game is still ♥♥♥♥. It's just like the most of those pseudo-retro games with retro graphics but in terms of gameplay, it's anything but. Broken stealth system, you can't run at full speed right away after moving from standing still (seriously, not even newer games do this anymore), the game auto aims for you & the Mario-stepping-on-enemies are clunky as hell. I also haven't found a reason to do this when you have other alternatives to kill the enemies. There's also the boring take cover & shoot when the enemy is not shooting & standing there like an idiot waiting to get shot. It happens too often & takes too much time.\n\nThat said, control is rigid. For a game focusing on rampage, this is totally the opposite experience I'm looking for. If you want a pseudo-retro game that excels in gameplay & still have a touch of their own (as in not being cheap copies of existing games & makes it a 'homage to retro games' as an excuse), get Hotline Miami or Binding of Isaac: Rebirth instead. Those are heaps & bounds better.\n\nIf I could refund the hell out of this game, I would. Luckily I bought it at discounted price.\n\n\n","August 8, 2015","false","0.6"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

This game doesn't really bring anything new to the table. RCR had pixel graphics and 8-bit music which is nothing new. The gameplay is basically just a top-down shooter and nothing more. The entire story is based around fixing a time machine for a scientist who time travels in a delorean, which is great because we didn't have enough references. Some of the missions are an outright pain in the ♥♥♥. For example: There's a mission where you play as BiffMan (YAY MORE REFERENCES) and you have to swing back and forth over and over again to hit a button that drops henchmen. You have to time it right and grab the henchmen and then time it right to drop them in the tank of crocodiles. You have to do this multiple times all while on a timer. There are many more annoying missions but I guess if you're hardcore and want to power through it, you can. Also, some of the mechanics such as the police are irritating. If you run over a couple people or crash into people while using the game's mediocre driving mechanics, you get a wanted level. The only way to lose said cops is by collecting cloaking device coin things which are placed throughout the city or starting a mission. This makes doing things extremely annoying because let's say you want to explore the map but accidentally run over someone in front of a cop. Well now you have to drop what you're doing and go around town looking for one of the coins or carry on while being swarmed with police officers. The game also gets very boring after a while. Unless you're doing missions nothing much changes. It's just the same old thing for the most part. The missions are kind of interesting but usually have the same goal and continue to drown you in references. In the end I would say $10 is too much for this game. If you find it on sale for $5 or less like I did then maybe give it a shot. You might have some fun with it but you'll probably get irritated with the same crap I did and give up on it.","February 14, 2015","false","4.7"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

I'd tried a demo before and it seemed like it would be funny and a lot of fun. However, it is most definitely not funny, and it's only moderately fun.\n\nThe game doesn't know how to tell a joke. Saying "hey look, it's Solid Snake! It's Doc Brown! It's the TARDIS!" is not a joke. It's the same problem that Duke Nukem Forever had with its humor. I love a good reference, but references alone do not make a game. The gameplay itself is average, and certainly nothing to write home about, but the humor was clearly supposed to carry it, and the humor just doesn't have any effort behind it. It just tries to throw thirty references at you a minute and hope that it overwhelms you with nostalgia enough that you don't notice that there's nothing else going for it.\n\nIt might not have been so disappointing for me, had Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon not already come out before I tried it, since it did the 80's reference/parody game a lot better.","January 22, 2014","false","6.9"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

Retro-graphics with chip-tunes, all pixeled out. Its a fun idea and the references are all great. It is chalk full of homages to all the greats (and not so greats ;)). There is obviously alot of love put into this game with constant updates, since I have owned it anyways. If you are into it, there is also several game modes that will get you plenty of hours.\n\nOne problem for me, and why I ultimately do not recommend it, is the controls. I mainly play with an X360 Wireless. Driving is obnoxious - its the style where 'up' on the controller = 'straight' regardless of your current orientation. It also forces you to map your own controller instead of recommending a default config. I mean the devs should find a tried-and-true setup and just recommend that (they surely can recommend something from all the time they spend playing it).\n\nSecond problem is the core gameplay. After you strip away all the clever references, you are left with some really bare-bones game mechanics that requires little skill or learning, and is mostly short little epidsodes that you plow through with little grace. They certainly try to have a strategy angle, but I don't think it matters too much. Maybe it does if you are trying to get top scores or something, I cannot speak for that.\n\nWhen it comes to indie love, this game has it all, but falls short with core gameplay and controls.","January 11, 2015","false","1.5"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","25","2","8","2","2"

But the reference parodys quickly lose their novelty as your constantly bombarded with them. Controls are extremely akward and most of the time it is difficult to perform what you want to( from stomping on guys to driving).\n\nBleh! The difficulty ramps up towards the end making it vastly more frustrating then challenging. Being crammed into small coriders where you get pummeled by 1 hit kill rockets or thrown into rooms with out a weapon and guys having guns could result in many many level restarts. The final boss is also a frustrating expierience with the need for pixel perfect  percision(which the akward controls makes difficult) and timing.\n\n\nThe Lowdown: I really wanted to like this game but just couldn't, the controls are akward in almost all aspects and this is with trying a controller and keyboard. The game starts off great but quickly loses its flavor of fun. The references come out like they are being forced(should of cutdown on them and fleshed out some more of the more popular ones). The difficulty changes midway to a point where it becomes frustrating  when you after to do the same level forty times due to you missing a set of triple jumps by a few pixels to you being stuck in a 2 block hallway where 6 guys shoot bazookas at you killing you in 1 shot before you can get your own shot off. Its a joke and a waste of time that you could be playing other games that actually make difficulty fair.Beating a gmae should feel like an acomplishment, but this one i was just glad that I was able to remove it from the backlog and off the HDD.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/syrsly/recommended/204630/","syrsly","Syrsly","http://steamcommunity.com/id/syrsly/","745 products in account","TL;DR: Good comedy multi-genre game with horrible controls.\n\nRest of review:\n\nRetro City Rampage is hilarious.  It has so many pop references around every corner that I can't help but laugh at the cameos from Paperboy, Sonic, Mario, Ninja Turtles, Bill And Ted, Back To The Future and so on.  It also makes light of the game development process by giving the player a "ROM City Rampage" prototype version of itself inside the player character's room.  The game relies on its humor and does a good job of keeping me entertained.\n\nThe controls are a different matter all together.  For starters, you're not given controller support, even though the game's store page and the game itself both say you should be able to use a controller.  I was tempted to map the controls with XPadder, but I didn't feel like going through the trouble of that.  Regardless, the default keyboard control scheme is not very comfortable, and I found the mouse useless.  Aiming at enemies without stepping into bullets was difficult because I could not control where I was looking while I was moving.  The auto-aim system doesn't work well, and I can't auto-aim at everything.  Overall, the game is frustrating to play because of the control scheme.\n\nIf you don't mind a little frustration and are looking for a funny 2D RPG shooter, Retro City Rampage should be your first choice.","January 1, 2015","true","4.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game gives you a lot of content if you compare it to most games nowadays that cost 10 bucks. You'll be hooked with this game and the amount of variety in it is impressive. More importantly, if you're here because you think it's just like GTA, this game most likely isn't for you. This game is for people who are fans of arcade and NES games, and people who are soft enough to wanna have a good laugh. Every mission is different in it's own way, and there's always a reference or parody that gets you to laugh. As you progress through the game, it obviously gets harder. This game isn't impossible, but it gets difficult, that's for sure. At first you just kill dudes with pistols, but then you're gonna run into dudes with bazookas.\n\nThe story is obviously not supposed to make sense, I mean this game is a parody, just look at the title. Despite how senseless it may be, it surely is entertaining. It was fun for me to walk down the street and randomly run into some batman parody, and then having to impersonate him. At least the game actually had a story, and it's been a while since I've enjoyed one this hilarious.\n\nI do recommend this game, and trust me, it is worth the 10 bucks.","June 2, 2014","true","17.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story isn't exactly anything to write home about, but that's easily forgiven with how "mature" this game is. From potshots at gaming companies, cameos out the whazoo from game devs and gaming icons alike, lookalike and soundalike references from games of the past and mixed in with a lot of tongue-in-cheek wisecracks that are designed to get you to bust a gut out laughing, there is absolutely no reason as to why this title should not be in your collection.","May 15, 2014","true","22.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You start as The Player, running around committing crimes just like you always do in your standard GTA. The over the top view is great, and more exciting than that (to me at least) is that for all this game you have an install of less than 40MB! Movie references will abound. The combat system is fun and the game is simple enough. I would definetly recommend this game if you are looking for a cheap time waster that's actually decently made.

The story isn't exactly anything to write home about, but that's easily forgiven with how "mature" this game is. From potshots at gaming companies, cameos out the whazoo from game devs and gaming icons alike, lookalike and soundalike references from games of the past and mixed in with a lot of tongue-in-cheek wisecracks that are designed to get you to bust a gut out laughing, there is absolutely no reason as to why this title should not be in your collection.","May 15, 2014","true","22.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game gives you a lot of content if you compare it to most games nowadays that cost 10 bucks. You'll be hooked with this game and the amount of variety in it is impressive. More importantly, if you're here because you think it's just like GTA, this game most likely isn't for you. This game is for people who are fans of arcade and NES games, and people who are soft enough to wanna have a good laugh. Every mission is different in it's own way, and there's always a reference or parody that gets you to laugh. As you progress through the game, it obviously gets harder. This game isn't impossible, but it gets difficult, that's for sure. At first you just kill dudes with pistols, but then you're gonna run into dudes with bazookas.\n\nThe story is obviously not supposed to make sense, I mean this game is a parody, just look at the title. Despite how senseless it may be, it surely is entertaining. It was fun for me to walk down the street and randomly run into some batman parody, and then having to impersonate him. At least the game actually had a story, and it's been a while since I've enjoyed one this hilarious.\n\nI do recommend this game, and trust me, it is worth the 10 bucks.","June 2, 2014","true","17.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Retro City Rampage features a fairly expansive open world with the car-theiving fun of GTA and the tongue-in-cheek humor of Nintendo games of the past. It revels in fact that it is a parody and makes every effort to remind you of it. There are enough 80's and 90's references to fill a hundred parodies, so don't even bother trying to figure out all of the source material.\n\nI was surprised by how many unlockables there are in this game and finding all of them proves to be quite the challenge. You can also customize your character with hats and hairstyles. For me, this really put RCR as more than just a parody. It's a love letter to two very different eras of gaming that go surprisingly well together. Some of the challenges are pretty frustrating, but even that difficulty harkens back to a time gone by of gaming.

Brian Provinciano (I think that's his name) did it. And did it well.\nRetro City Rampage is hilarious, action packed, and above all, fun to play. I haven't played too many sandbox games other than Minecraft, but I easily jumped into this game with few problems. It's everything the first two GTA games were, and plenty more. Decent sized map, full of secrets and multiple characters to play as in free-roam mode, including Super Meat Boy and Commander Video. Even though I've heard people say that the game lacks it's own ideas, and that is sort of true. The game is a massive parody of tons of stuff from the 80s and 90s. Featuring Back to the Future, Metal Gear Solid, Contra, Duck Hunt, and many, MANY more.\nThe stroy is very confusing at first, which is a down side, but once you get into it... at the least hilarious and kinda creative. The levels themselves are usually fair and difficult. However, that being said, due to the awkward controls (believe me, you'll know what I mean if you buy the game or already own it) and the level design itself can be downright ridiculous, the levels aren't always fun.\nOverall, the game is fun, hilarious, and at some points creative. 8/10","February 8, 2014","true","7.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's essentially a random assortment of old school video game jokes and internet memes that are somehow woven into a narrative that is better than most storylines coming from games these days.  You'll be laughing the whole way through this game.\n\nThe gameplay is very simple, top down old school GTA style with more of an 8 bit feel and a combination of driving, shooting and platforming.  It's very easy at first but the difficulty ramps up later in the game and definitely when trying to 100% the game.  Very reminiscent of a challenging NES game.\n\nWhat can I say about the art design?  It's 8 bit, it's awesome, exactly what it should be.\n\nThe sound is incredible.  Most of the music sounds very familiar to old favourite NES classics.  Certain tracks made me feel pumped as I raced to the next mission.\n\nAchievements are mixed bag of story progression, jokes and completion.  To get all achievements will be a challenge but to those true completionists getting all the achievements and 100%ing the game will be a rewarding pain in your ♥♥♥.\n\nIf you are all about modern games and can't look back then this game isn't for you.

This game will remind you how great of a console it was. As well as remind you what a piece of ♥♥♥♥ing dog ♥♥♥♥ some of the games were.

But beyond that, this game doesn't have too much substance post references and cameos (John Romero is in this game, and he gives you the Konami Code). Controls are pretty good and the game-play is solid, also the music is really nice, just this game will more than likely make you angry at one point or another. Just like the ♥♥♥♥ing NES.\n\nProtip 1: Borrow a bus, run into every pedestrian you can (They need help sleeping, the town has an insomnia epidemic), then get the threat meter to red. Then steal every tank and park them in the Pay 4 Spray.\n\nProtip 2: Enable blood with this "innocent" cheat (it doesn't disable achievements or saving); A B A Y A B B / X O X Tri X O O (360/PS controller) or just Jump Grab Jump Use Jump Grab Grab","April 23, 2014","true","10.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Retro city rampage is a spoof of several games and movies and will throw you for a thrill ride. The easiest comparison to this game is 8-bit grandtheft auto/saints row chaos. You will classicly only have your 3 hearts as lives inwhich you'll need to find more throughout your world as you do whatever the hell you want.\n\nThis game is packed with random missions and mini-games for the player to do alongside the random main storyline of the player. Long story short, you're in a pixel world and your a ganster... GOOMBA STOMP. yes, they allow you to goomba stomp. Ontop of goomba stomping you have a large arsinal of weapons at your disposal that you will pick up between smg's pistols, cricket bats, baseball bats, crowbars and stealing peoples cars to run over masses of people.\n\nOverview:\nPros: The randomness and silly chaos of this game is exciting and never gets boring along with the dozens of chaos filled mini-games scattered about such as USE THIS TANK AND BLOW UP THINGS TO GET POINTS or use a smg to shoot as many things to get points ect. Its a relatively silly game and has spoofs that people will instantly know when they come up such as back to the future and mario's goomba stomp.\n\nCons: The only cons about this game that may bother someone is if you do not save frequently - this is a retro game you will lose all your things even if you have hearts remaining. This may frustrate some people as they lose their mass arsinal of weaons.\n\nFinal thoughts: when this game is on sale for a few bucks I would highly reccomend picking it up if you're into 8-bit chaos. The graphics reminds me a little of terraria and its alot of fun to casually play every so often. All and all, it was worth the $4 I spent on it and even possibly its full price.","March 28, 2013","true","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A game that used to be planned to just be a fan GTA3 demake (named Grand Theftendo) but after it was shelved it revived as this game. The combat is pretty fun and funny at times (with mario style jump stomps) and the vehicles are pretty sweet too (from a yoshi motorcycle to kip from knight rider). Also some of the options in this game give you so much joy as some video filters can change the game to looking as if you're playing it in a Virtual Boy and even borders to look like different TVs (with one being an arcade cabinet with cool stickers of instructions). If you are an old school gamer that loves the times of 8-bit, chiptunes, and nostalgia then you definately need to pick this game up. so, are you a bad enough dude to play Retro City Rampage?

The last portion of the game is great fun, and it's a shame the rest of the game is quite different from it. The approach to design seems to be to insert as much content as possible with no sense of an overall idea or quality, meaning the game shines when it gets a level or concept right, but feels boring and repetitive when it misses the mark. The usual "indie game" circlejerking with cameos from Phil Fish, Minecraft, Super Meat Boy, Destructoid and others also irks me, just because I really don't like the culture that has sprung up around indie games. Overall, though, it's still got a lot of bang for your buck, with plenty of extra game modes and challenges to take on once you've done the rather short story mode, and all kinds of collectables and customisation.","July 8, 2013","true","10.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

That's what this game will do to your mind. At least if you're an 80s-90s gamer of any age. The sheer amount of nostalgia will make your head explode, recompile, then explode again. Every mission is an adventure through time to the age of hardcore gameplay, simple (yet stylized) graphics, and amazing chiptune music.\n\nI'd try to list all the references, but I think my fingers would ignite from the effort. If you know what NES-era gaming was like, and have fond memories (even of the awful bits, like the Ninja Turtles game, especially the dam level), you will absolutely f**kin' LOVE this game. Period.\n\nThe general gameplay recipe is this: take a decent dose of GTA, mix in some Saints Row shenanigans, add a hefty plethora of NES-era stuff (both references and gameplay... and graphics and sounds and...), as well as a generous portion of modernization in terms of controls and smoothness, and bam... you've got Retro City Rampage. Every single part of it is immensely enjoyable and relatable, while still being fresh enough to keep even the most ADHD-riddled brains occupied.\n\nTo top it all of the developer even added a truly 8-bit version (playable *within* the game itself)... so much so that the extracted version will work just fine on an NES emulator!!! Just take a moment to think: this (or at least a *version* of this) was possible back in the 80s. This kind of gameplay and variety and just general awesomeness... it was all possible. My god... what have we been missing?!\n\nLook, this game is amazing. Hands down, flat out... amazing. From start to finish you won't be bored and, if anything, you'll just be craving finding the rest of the secrets and references. Get it NOW if you grew up playing NES-era games, and if not? Well... you'll enjoy it just the same (though I can't say you'll get the same sense of nostalgia that the rest of us will).\n\nThe dev is basically a one-man show (who I have spoken with personally and is a truly kickass dude), has supported practically every platform out there (and for the rest is working diligently on it), and is ABSOLUTELY someone you should follow for future releases. Zero complaints, nothing but praise... not much more to say!","October 11, 2013","true","17.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

The last portion of the game is great fun, and it's a shame the rest of the game is quite different from it. The approach to design seems to be to insert as much content as possible with no sense of an overall idea or quality, meaning the game shines when it gets a level or concept right, but feels boring and repetitive when it misses the mark. The usual "indie game" circlejerking with cameos from Phil Fish, Minecraft, Super Meat Boy, Destructoid and others also irks me, just because I really don't like the culture that has sprung up around indie games. Overall, though, it's still got a lot of bang for your buck, with plenty of extra game modes and challenges to take on once you've done the rather short story mode, and all kinds of collectables and customisation.","July 8, 2013","true","10.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

Controls are pretty good and the game-play is solid, also the music is really nice, just this game will more than likely make you angry at one point or another. Just like the ♥♥♥♥ing NES.\n\nProtip 1: Borrow a bus, run into every pedestrian you can (They need help sleeping, the town has an insomnia epidemic), then get the threat meter to red. Then steal every tank and park them in the Pay 4 Spray.\n\nProtip 2: Enable blood with this "innocent" cheat (it doesn't disable achievements or saving); A B A Y A B B / X O X Tri X O O (360/PS controller) or just Jump Grab Jump Use Jump Grab Grab","April 23, 2014","true","10.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Brian Provinciano (I think that's his name) did it. And did it well.\nRetro City Rampage is hilarious, action packed, and above all, fun to play. I haven't played too many sandbox games other than Minecraft, but I easily jumped into this game with few problems. It's everything the first two GTA games were, and plenty more. Decent sized map, full of secrets and multiple characters to play as in free-roam mode, including Super Meat Boy and Commander Video. Even though I've heard people say that the game lacks it's own ideas, and that is sort of true. The game is a massive parody of tons of stuff from the 80s and 90s. Featuring Back to the Future, Metal Gear Solid, Contra, Duck Hunt, and many, MANY more.\nThe stroy is very confusing at first, which is a down side, but once you get into it... at the least hilarious and kinda creative. The levels themselves are usually fair and difficult. However, that being said, due to the awkward controls (believe me, you'll know what I mean if you buy the game or already own it) and the level design itself can be downright ridiculous, the levels aren't always fun.\nOverall, the game is fun, hilarious, and at some points creative. 8/10","February 8, 2014","true","7.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There is only about 30 or 20 missions and 5 side missions and they said 60+ story missions! But because that is not important what IS important is the fact that this is a great game all together. Honestly this game is about 40 or 20 hours of gamplay. (Depending on your skill level) And about 30 or 10 of those hours are actually worth it. Like really! Half of the enemys and levels are tedious and boring. (SPOILERS AHEAD) Like, one of the enemys is immune to every single weapon you have and oneshots you. You have to make sure you pick up one of the strongest blast weapons to ensure you can defeat him. And then at the end of the game they put 120 (and respawning) of those enemys. Lucky I wasn't using a controller.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGood things about Retro City Rampage: The game serves hours of replay value and has way too many secrets. But FINDING those secrets is amazing.

But RCR isn't only that but it's also a game that WAS meant for old school fans of video games. It was originally meant to be a remake of GTA III under the title Grand Theftendo but was later changed into a original game in 2007 with the title being changed to Retro City Rampage.\n\nStory focuses on a guy simply named player who was working on a bank heist with the Jester until he time travels to the year 20XX where a young scientist names Doc Choc finds him and helps him get back to his year, 1985, by finding pieces of the time machine which breaks down when you travel\n\nGameplay does have a GTA feel to it in 8-Bit but also throws in many video game references within the first 4-5 minutes of the game. Theirs also references to classic shows and movies from the 80's. You can also do side jobs in order to make lots of money. And you can even play as famous characters from indie games such as, Super Meat Boy, Steve from Minecraft and Commander Video from the Bit.Trip series.\n\nI say get this game if your a hugh fan of classic games or if you love the GTA series as well. You will be hooked in.","April 21, 2014","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Outside of that, it's a fun walk-around/drive-around game like the original GTA, with plenty of missions, side-missions, hidden bits and roaming to keep you happy.\n\n\n\nAnd even in free-roaming mode, it's a good five-minute blast while you're waiting for other things.","October 10, 2012","true","16.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's essentially a random assortment of old school video game jokes and internet memes that are somehow woven into a narrative that is better than most storylines coming from games these days.  You'll be laughing the whole way through this game.\n\nThe gameplay is very simple, top down old school GTA style with more of an 8 bit feel and a combination of driving, shooting and platforming.  It's very easy at first but the difficulty ramps up later in the game and definitely when trying to 100% the game.  Very reminiscent of a challenging NES game.\n\nWhat can I say about the art design?  It's 8 bit, it's awesome, exactly what it should be.\n\nThe sound is incredible.  Most of the music sounds very familiar to old favourite NES classics.  Certain tracks made me feel pumped as I raced to the next mission.\n\nAchievements are mixed bag of story progression, jokes and completion.  To get all achievements will be a challenge but to those true completionists getting all the achievements and 100%ing the game will be a rewarding pain in your ♥♥♥.\n\nIf you are all about modern games and can't look back then this game isn't for you.  But if you grew up or even played and enjoyed your share of 8 bit era games then this is a must play!!","March 30, 2014","true","13.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
