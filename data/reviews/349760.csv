Simple objective, direct him toward to exit while collecting hidden coins and puzzle pieces.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmi4jWrzbc\nControls are all mouse driven, click on platforms to move them, buttons to use them while directing Bob backward and forward dodging hazards. Screen resolutions of 4k were supported, toggles not sliders for sound. Three worlds were available with a fourth coming in December. Each contained 25 levels and collecting all puzzle pieces rewards an extra 5. Coins collected could be spent on a range of costumes, most drawing reference to gaming and pop culture (Half Life 3!). Collectables were often quite well hidden, which plays like a HoG side-quest.\n\nMore aimed at the younger generation it's still enjoyable for older gamers, just quite short lived for the price. If in column B perhaps wait out a sale or coupon and you shouldn't leave disappointed.

Plenty of Jean, Julien, Andre and Paolo (yes, Paolo is a well-known name in the snail community) - but Bob. . .  that is surely the first one I have ever met!\n\nSnail Bob 2 is a casual puzzle game for parents to play with their kids, but also enjoyable for all ages. At first, you will meet Bob and go through a small tutorial which will show you how make Bob turn around, move and stop, as well as what you will have to look for within the level, such as buttons to press, levers to activate and other things to look for in the level.\n\nBob will have 3 stories to play in this game and each of them has 30 levels to complete. Basically, you will have to get Pao.., sorry Bob to the door with the exist sign in one piece. In each level, you will have to collect three Stars which are very well hidden or blend in within the artwork. Some levels will have a puzzle piece to collect; in total you will have to gather twelves pieces to achieve the entire puzzle. Each time you collect a certain number of stars, you will be given a new outfit in your wardrobe. Bob could become a pirate, a plumber, a Viking snail and much more!\n\nThe path to the exit door is not difficult but you will have several obstacles to navigate in each level. Time of play is approximately thirty-five minutes per story.\n\nPositives:\n~~~~~~~\n\n-	Cute artwork\n-	90 levels to complete\n-	Great to play with kids\n-	Trading Cards & Achievements\n\nNegatives:\n~~~~~~~~\n\n-	Short game\n-	Repetitive\n\nSnail Bob 2 is a casual game for parents and kids to play together.\n\n6.5/10\n\nKey provided by developer/publisher for review purposes.

Get Snail Bob to the exit, safely.\nHe will constantly move through the level, so you need to interact with the environment by shifting platform positions, scaring enemies away, etc. You can also click on him to make him stay in one spot, which is useful if you need time to set up something, or keep him on a moving platform. Your second ability is to turn him around.\n\nWith those simple mechanics, you're ready to play the entire game. Although it's very simple, the game can still make for some decently challenging and fun puzzles. It never gets insanely difficult, as it's meant to stay a decently casual and relaxing experience. You can collect hidden stars throughout the game, and use them to unlock costumes for Bob. Some levels also have a hidden puzzle piece, that once all have been collected in a chapter, will unlock a few bonus levels.\n\nThe game is very simple, yet entertaining. It's got a few pop culture references and jokes every now and again, and the cutscenes are cute, and will make you laugh.\n\nOverall, a charming and fun game!","September 25, 2015","true","3.7"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","69","11","16","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Zagan/recommended/349760/","Zagan","Zagan lit as fucko","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Zagan/","442 products in account","As the Spanish translator of the game, today I decided to try it out and then review it.\n\nPlot and LevelsThe game contains various stories which don't have much plot: they just have an introduction to introduce yourself in the new area, and an ending in which Bob leaves it.\nEvery area consists of 25 levels, and each one has 3 stars to collect, while some of them have "puzzle pieces" to collect aswell. Getting a specific number of stars unlocks new costumes, and when you get enough pieces to complete the puzzle, you unlock 5 extra levels related to the area you're playing at.\nThe game has some cool mechanics (which I didn't expect) and even 2 boss battles.\n\nDifficultyThe game is focused to be played by kids so it's not difficult at all. You may fail some times because of stupid actions but you don't really have to think much to complete the game. Boss battles are easy, too.\nThe thing that resulted me a bit harder was to find every star. I'm not sure if it's because colors distract me more than they do to other people, but there are hidden stars in the background and I couldn't find them easily because of their color. The same with some puzzle pieces.\n\nMusicThere is a specific tune for each area. Although they're looped, they aren't annoying due to their "softness" and "harmony" (I don't know how to explain it).\nThe music is as simple as the game so it fits great.\n\nCultural ReferencesIt's the aspect I liked the most of the game. There are backgrounds, clickable items, themes, costumes... which refer to shows and movies (LOST, Star Wars, Spongebob...), videogames (Half Life, Fallout, Metal Gear Solid, Super Mario, Mortal Kombat...) and books (Robin Hood?).\n\nRatingI think that the game is a 7'5/10 even being focused to children, cause it can result fun and entertaining for everyone, and these cultural references improve the even more. I just dislike that some mechanics become a bit repetitive, and that the game's length is too short: I completed (100%'d) the game in just 2 hours. I would love to play more levels!","November 23, 2015","true","2.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/briancarnell/recommended/349760/","briancarnell","briancarnell","http://steamcommunity.com/id/briancarnell/","865 products in account","Cute little Lemmings-like game. The art/music/sound were very well done, and there was a lot of humor in some of the levels/situations that was amusing.\n\nThe levels are extremely easy to solve -- the difficulty level would be appropriate for a 10 or 11 year old though (my 12yo isn't into these kinds of games, but was happy to sit next to me and offer possible solutions).\n\nThe one thing I did not like about the game was the star/puzzle piece mechanic. On each level are 3 stars and occasionally a puzzle piece hidden somewhere that the player has to find (technically, you could ignore this, but you need the stars to unlock outfits and the puzzle pieces to, well, solve the puzzle).\n\nThe problem is that for almost all of the levels, the stars/puzzle pieces are designed so that they blend into the background so this part of the game becomes "methodically search in a vertical pattern for anomalous objects."\n\nOn a few of the levels, the puzzle pieces/stars are hidden behind objects that you have to activate, which made a lot more sense and felt like it was actually part of the game. The "find the hidden object" portion felt divorced from the rest of the gameplay.\n\nAll-in-all, though, totally worth it for $5 if you like these kind of games and don't mind the low difficulty level.","September 26, 2015","true","5.7"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","4","7","0","0"

The comparisons to Lemmings are fairly spot on, though you simply have more direct control over a single 'lemming', aka the titular Snail Bob.\n\nEach level tasks you with guiding Bob to the goal with numerous types of mini-puzzle objectives along the way to create a safe path.  All levels are single-screen, but can become fairly complex as you progress through the game.  I haven't found the game to become particularly difficult, but some stages require extra thought.  It fits in a niche of being engaging enough for adults but accessible enough for younger children.\n\nIn addition to the goal of guiding Bob, each level has 3 hidden stars as well as occasional puzzle pieces.  Collecting enough of these unlocks costumes for Bob or additional levels (in the case of the puzzle pieces).  Progress is never gated by them however, so there's no pressure to fully scour every level if you don't want to.  Since you can tell Bob to stop at any time, you can easily 'pause' him in a safe place while you hunt for hidden objects, giving a more relaxing feel to the searching.\n\nThe game currently consists of 90 levels with more slated to be added at a later date.  There's certainly a 'mobile game' feel to the structure and aesthetic, but the game plays perfectly well on PC.  It won't win any awards for technical achievement, but it succeeds in the goal of being a family friendly puzzle game for all ages.","October 1, 2015","true","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
