This is an adventure game,  and it indulges in some of the worst elements of the genre; i.e. the puzzles tend to involve combing over every single screen and interacting with everything in every possible way until something actually happens. It's also obscure enough that there are no walkthroughs online yet, so have fun getting all the achievements! (I managed it with some help from the Steam forums). The game also features multiple ways to progress at points, which can be a little confusing when you're trying to figure out what to do with the items in your inventory, since they're not all actually necessary. (Using different items can lead you to different endings for each of the two "acts" in episode 1; bizarrely, the standard ending of act two is far more counter-intuitive than the "hard" ending).\n\n2. This is episode 1 of a longer story; as such, the ending is pretty abrupt. Actually, the plot in generally is pretty incoherent. I didn't actually have a problem with that, as I'll explain below, but if you go into this one expecting a clear story, you'll likely be disappointed.\n\nSo, why did I like this strange, flawed little game so much? Well, the atmosphere is truly fantastic. I'm a big cyberpunk fan, and the visuals and and music here do an incredible job of conveying that classic dark cyberpunk atmosphere (seriously, the soundtrack is AMAZING). The writing sometimes feels like it's trying too hard to be edgy, and sometimes feels like it's been badly translated, but there are also wonderful moments of humor too, and the overall effect is wonderfully hypnotic. It's one of those games that makes you feel like you've really stepped into another world, one where you barely have any idea what's going on, and that fits perfectly with the main character's hazy detachment from reality. I loved existing in this world; I loved playing as Fyn, who is one of those cyberpunk protagonists who's always starving and strung out and lurking around in grimy clubs and working dead-end jobs just to get by. If you're a fan of the genre, Void and Meddler is definitely worth checking out; just be aware of its flaws before you buy.","December 5, 2015","true","3.7"," 54 of 56 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","54","56","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thekillerbits/recommended/377970/","thekillerbits","thekillerbits","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thekillerbits/","784 products in account","So I was actually really excited to give Void & Meddler a go as it does look incredibly cool. The pixel art aesthetic does a great job of melding that slightly retro, 80's vision of the future (with its grim streets bathed in a neon glow) with the weird, Naked Lunch story and characters. But... pretty art can only carry a game so far.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lE2nC3_Ak0\n\nYou play Fyn, a young woman who has lost her memories and is setting out find out who she really is.\n\nThe game plays out like a traditional point-and-click set in this weird dsytopian, cyberpunk world where robot bartenders are serving alcoholic soda, you can buy memories at the corner store and your free to date a frog if you want. And as colorful as that sounds (and the art is) this game is pretty dull.\n\nThe writing is quite messy. Yes, you are free explore in a non-linear way but there is nothing really driving the story onwards. The characters all fairly one dimensional and forgettable [no pun intended]. And the main character, Fyn, kind of reminded me of Lisbeth Salander from the Millenium Trilogy of books ...just without her winning personality. Fyn is obviously meant to be quite obnoxious and a hard person to like but there is nothing about her you can even vaguely empathise with. (And honestly after 30 minutes or so I didn't really care if she got her memories back or not.)\n\nThis coupled with the fact that the puzzles are relatively straight forward and well signposted and that the full game is being stretched out over several months (in three episodic releases) is leading me to give it the thumbs down.\n\nIf you enjoy cyberpunk & neo-noir stories it might be worth checking out. But if you are after a fun point-and-click or an engaging episodic adventure I'd maybe give this one a miss (or at least wait until all 3 parts are out next year).","October 28, 2015","false","5.1"," 61 of 88 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","61","88","0","1"

Although it's ambitious and stylistic in its noirish, eurocomic-esque cynical poetry, It feels teenaged and strained, often not really achieving what it's going for or making much impact beyond the surface.\n\nIt would be easier to swallow if it didn't fall prey to the classic problem(s) of classic-style point-and-click adventure games. The solutions feel arbitrary and come down to clicking every option on every thing, with the game's sullen attitude to the player and its world just becoming irksome as it chides you with every attempt you make to progress,\n\nHaving said that some of the game's wry responses and the over-the-top degeneracy of the protagonist and world did get a few chuckles out of me. I think there's potential for this to be built upon in later episodes which makes me not want to give up on it yet. And just to emphasize again, the art and music really are fantastic and worth seeing!","November 9, 2015","true","0.3"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","14","15","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/breezeark/recommended/377970/","breezeark","Vertigo Chorus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/breezeark/","95 products in account","Well, I got a game on steam, it was a cyberpunk adventure game with a female protagonist that had a premise about messing with memories, by this point I felt like I'd heard this one before. Twenty minutes later, I'd bullied a nerd, flirted with a robot, romanced Ewan McGregor and made a guy shoot himself like twelve times, which never stops being funny.\n\nI love Cyberpunk, colourful, asian-american-cross, all sorts of interesting characters and a moderate, sensible quantity of sex and drugs and stuff.\n\nThis game follows Fynn, your run of the mill Cyberpunk punk who also happens to be a complete ♥♥♥♥♥, good, too many characters are supposed to be nice and relateable, I personally love playing as jerks. I have enough being nice in my normal life, in video games, I want to be a total jerk to everyone.\n\nAs well as relatively engaging (if somewhat unchallenging) puzzles, and a main character that's incredibly well written (to the point where I would click every option on every interactible to hear what she had to say), the game can also be a bit unsettling. The post-sex conversation with this weird woman (or whatever it is for you), all your options are weird symbols, I liked that. The bullying of the nerd was so longlasting that it just makes you feel uncomfortable without feeling too forced. The repeated suicide was super creepy the first few times.\n\nI feel like I'd love to keep talking, but this game needs to be first-hand.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/NiandraLades/recommended/377970/","NiandraLades","Niandra Lades","http://steamcommunity.com/id/NiandraLades/","353 products in account","Void and Meddler contains a lot of things that I love - Cyberpunk, adventure and queer/trans elements, but sadly that doesn't stop the game from falling into a few pitfalls of bad Point and Click adventures, as well as few of its own problems.\n\nCredit where it's due, the art in this game is lovely, especially the backgrounds which have a gorgeous colour palette that create fantastic atmosphere. The characters themselves are pixel art and while it's an artstyle you've seen before many times in indie games, it still looks nice. As well as being visually pleasing, the soundtrack too is very good and suitable for a Cyberpunk adventure. It's similar to Hotline Miami's in some places, which is wonderful.\n\nA lot of bad Point and Click games share the same flaws - the objective isn't inherent, which means you'll spend a lot of time just clicking things or go look up a walkthrough and that can happen here. Another is that while a puzzle or item combination may make sense in the head of the game designer, to a player it's completely unobvious.\n\nSome spoilers but let's go through one I just did; there's a guy at the arcade who will exchange drugs for an item that belonged to a famous person. At the beginning, you can get a rubber duck from your bathroom and outside a nightclub, there's a bottle of smelly liquid in a hobo's corner. Combine the two to get a dirty duck and you give it to the guy, lying about what the item is. Maybe I missed some things in game, but I'd gone to every location and looked around properly before reading the Steam Discussions forum for this but I honestly have no idea how you would link the two items together on your own. I'm not finished with this game and if similar puzzles later on in the game are like this, I probably won't do so.\n\nThe game mentions itself being non-linear in the Steam description and I honestly do not think that's a good thing for Point and Click games. Now hear me out, I'm not saying it shouldn't be done - having multiple solutions to a puzzle or way to progress the story is a really good idea that adds replay value and suits different play styles but if you're going to be open, then please make it more obvious what you have to do or how to progress, because otherwise it only means I have to click more random ♥♥♥♥ in hopes of moving forward.\n\nThe main character is not likeable in the slightest and just constantly acts incredibly ♥♥♥♥♥♥ without even a drop of remorse. Once again, spoilers, but you want to distract a person who works at the arcade. There's a guy plugged into a machine, dancing. You fry his brain by insulting him and saying it's his fault his girlfriend left. The writing overall is okay but as others have mentioned, comes across as trying too hard to be edgy which explains Fyn's attitude.\n\nI'm going to continue playing Void and Meddler, because I feel like I should give it more of a chance. It has the potential to be an amazing game and I hope it gets there.","November 8, 2015","false","2.0"," 19 of 27 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","19","27","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/deadpanash/recommended/377970/","deadpanash","DeadPanAsh","http://steamcommunity.com/id/deadpanash/","145 products in account","Coming from a fan of point & click adventures, this game has quickly gone up on my list. Needless to say, the art style and color pallette fits in beautifully with the cyberpunk aesthetic. That alone was enough to draw me into the gameplay. With 2 acts and 3 alternate endings for each, the puzzle path you choose to proceed with is pretty straightforward but still difficult enough to leave you clueless.\n\nAlthough enjoyable to play, the story dialogue could easily be improved. The main characters attitude felt a little forced, which made it a little difficult to hold a liking to her. She clearly is meant to potray this "Screw the world" attitude but it feels like the need to express that was taken a little too far. The writers could have had a different approach and still gotten the desired effect. The story line itself in relation to the dialogue also seems a bit disconnected. Everyone seems to speak in this sort of code that doesn't seem to do anything for the plot. This could be beneficial in a way if the intentions are for you as the player to feel as though you too have lost important elements of your memory causing a major disconnect.\n\nAll in all, I am very intrigued with this game and look forward to playing the future episodes. It's not perfect but definetely left a good impression for me to feel the need to speak highly of it and encourage others to experience it as well.","November 8, 2015","true","4.9"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

It relies heavily on its writing, and yet that writing has not been edited and polished. It’s hard to go ten minutes through this game without coming across a jarring grammar error or a typo. This is of course something which can be fixed, and would raise the overall rating of the game a good 5% on its own.\n\nThe writing is also “purple prose”--as in, it’s ornately written, all the time, with little clean text in between to make metaphors stand out. This is clearly meant to be a tool to create dreamlike atmosphere. The problem is, even dreams have solid parts which lure you to think that they are real. I think that the writing could use more solid parts to achieve that effect.\n\nOf course, the main draw of the game is its atmosphere. The artwork and music take every opportunity to exude atmosphere. “Blade Runner” (the movie, not the game) with dirtier undertones, essentially. If that attracts your attention, then it’s probably worth getting. That’s only atmosphere, though, not story.\n\nIf you’re looking for a story arc and good puzzles, this is probably not the point and click to pick up. It doesn’t strive for a story arc, and the puzzles are barely puzzles at all.\n","October 29, 2015","false","4.3"," 18 of 28 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","18","28","0","0"

There is a big Bladerunner heart pumping all over! Therefore, I highly enjoyed it! The graphics are pure sweet burning eye candy, creating goose bumps in combination with the music. So make sure you get the soundtrack, as well!\n\nThough be aware that the game isn't that long. I'm about 100 minutes into the game and the episode already ended. But!!! You have three different paths you can choose – unfortunately that wasn't really visible to me. I only recognized the possibility after I checked the achievements and did some research. They should at least give you a hint about that, after you finished the game.\n\nSadly, the same goes for the puzzles: They didn't feel neither fun nor new. I mostly hated them, solving them by trial and error. I also did a lot of unnecessary walking. There are not much puzzles, though, but I got stuck several times and walking made it really hard to keep patient.\n\nFor me the game felt good enough to wait for the next episode, because it has a really amazing, tight atmosphere. Nonetheless, I hope the next episode might have more to offer, like more interesting characters (that actually talk to me) or that the story is more focused. The character can sometimes feel a bit too 'Whatever', which makes it a bit hard to really feel for her and not dump her and explore the city on your own ;)\n\nBut fans of adventure games and cyber punk will find a friend in the game, come what may!","March 22","true","1.8"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Вокруг нее как будто ожил «Больной безумный мир» — город заполнен зверо-людьми, наркоманами, бомжами и гомосексуалистами. Дождевой блум причудливо изменяет формы неоновых вывесок, поток машин напоминает бесконечную оранжевую реку, вся музыка превратилась в нойз, все новости депрессивны, но никому нет до этого дела. Цинизм — единственное спасение от окружающего, и Фин овладела им в совершенстве.\n\nМногие сравнивают Void & Meddler с «Голым завтраком» Берроуза. Сравнение более чем уместное, учитывая всю шизофреничность, расщепленность мира игры. Сцены разваливаются на отдельные детали, детали распадаются на пиксели, и не удивительно, что между локациями мы перемещаемся на метро: здесь подземка — что-то вроде символа перемещения в какую-то новую реальность, а не городской транспорт, слишком каждое новое место непохоже на предыдущие.  Город – словно набор этих разношерстных локаций, скрепленных веткой метро.\n\nПомимо Берроуза у Void & Meddler есть, конечно, и другие источники вдохновения. К примеру «Вирт» Джеффа Нуна, в котором мир сновидений сливается с реальным. Все это также сильно похоже на роман «Нет» Линор Горалик и Сергея Кузнецова — паноптикум с людьми, превращающимися в детей и зверей, и порнографией-как-искусством.\n\nЕдинственный недостаток Void & Meddler заключается в том, что это не вполне игра, скорее пособие по пиксельхантингу, которое не очень заботится о том, чтобы быть интересным для игрока. Как и Shadowrun: Hong Kong, Void & Meddler скорее интересна читателям.\n\n\n","March 10","true","1.9"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

Unlike this review.\nThe story and the world hit me personally. It doesnt explain how things work, and thats how it should be. Things just ARE how they are. For Fyn, certain objects are just normal everyday stuff. It doesnt give history lessons when whole-synthetic food became something people pick from stores casually. You just pick it up. Thats how it deals with genders and some "species" melted with humans. Like man with bird head. It doesnt go on waving acceptance-flag if you are afraid of such things.\n\nThe art is really something I personally enjoy. It might be pixelated, but its mix of that and smoother backgrounds.

This isn't the point click adventure I had hoped for. For one, there is no voice dialogue, it’s boring and bland, uninteresting. The cyberpunk feel is seemingly there, but it isn't. It's more like a hipster view on how cyberpunk should be or is.\n\nThe lead character I found remotely interesting, but again, the lack of voice dialogue really spoiled it for me. Honestly, who the hell wants to read on their monitor after a hard days work, I mean really? I also felt like the story wasn't interesting, I didn't care about any of it and I like Point Click Adventures.\n\nI don't know, it wasn't for me. I don't overly like this game, I felt like there were much nicer titles out there, Gemini Rue, Broken Age, Broken Sword 5, Primordia, Technobabylon, Shardlight.\n\nMy rating 2/5 - Lacking voice dialogue, uninteresting side charectars, lacking immersion, lacking interest.

Void & Meddler is a gorgeous game, in both its visuals and music. The game was developed by musicians and it shows - the music is grungey and punk and perfect for the atmosphere. Every song is extremely high quality, music that you could actually listen to outside of the game.\n\nVisually the game is also a delight, the environments are colorful and flashy, it reminds me a lot of Bladerunner. Needless to say, the game is a visual delight for any fan of the cyberpunk genre. I also fell in love with the character sprites - they had a lot of detail and were each unique. I found myself wishing I could zoom in further in the big crowd scenes (especially La Jette) just to take in all the unique designs.\n\nAnother amazing aspect of Void & Meddler are the little details. I really enjoyed how the rain fell on the screen when Fyn was walking outside, or how the screen would pixelate and distort after Fyn had alcohol. There are quite a few small things like that which help to make the world feel more vibrant.\n\nAs far as weaknesses, however, the game has a few. The first is its puzzles. Some of the puzzles just didn't make sense, and you'd have to click around randomly combining items of examining things until you got the right combination. There are a number of times where you're told to do something but you get no hints as to where to go next. For instance, there's a part where the dialogue basically says "Find this guy" but you're forced to wander around until you find him in another random location. The good news is, there are multiple ways to solve puzzles, so you do have a fair number of options if you can't figure something out.\n\nThe other major weakness is the plot. It suffers from a major issue with "telling" instead of "showing." We're told, in the exposition, that Fyn has had a crappy situation to deal with for the past two years, but all we're shown is a surly girl who goes around being rude to people, including the player, and causes trouble. Even though I understand why she wants a change in her life, the way she's going about it is confusing (why does she think the grey punk can fix her memories? What was the point of going to Moore?). The story is hard to follow because of these issues, and it also makes Fyn a difficult to relate to character, which is crucial if we're going to be following her around for two more episodes.\n\nFyn herself is a hard character to get behind. A lot of her dialogue is very angsty and it can get grating as the game progresses. She has a number of monolgues which go into how nasty of a person she is, talking about how she pretends to like people so she can manipulate them into protecting her, and another one about how she thinks she is smarter than everyone else. She even tells the player a certain character has a crush on her, but when we meet this character, he tells her "I feel uncomfortable with you being here, please leave." I don't mind jerk characters in fiction, but this is the protagonist, the person we're supposed to root for and relate to. With Fyn, there's not a whole lot to redeem her, which makes her an incredibly difficult character to play. If I'm supposed to care about Fyn by the end of this series, then she needs to knock down the ego and the angst, big time.\n\nHowever, I think there are also some good moments. There are some legitimately funny dialogs in the game, and Fyn does have some interesting things to say from time to time. I just wish it was more frequent and more consistent. The world Mi-Clos has built is freaking awesome - I love the concept of the mixing of animal DNA and gender fluidity as commonplace, but they need to let it shine a little more.\n\nIn conclusion, Void & Meddler is a beautiful game packed with ambiance and cyberpunk charm. It has its problems story-wise and puzzle-wise, but I don't regret my purchase in the slightest.","January 6","true","2.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

These things were fairly consistent throughout the game. There were a few points it grew to the point where it gave the effect that my vision was blurry as well as generally irritating my eyes or head one way or another. Which is why I was even more disappointed when I found out that there was no solid run function. You can run in a few areas, but never as fast as you might want to or as consistently as you might want to. I understand that they want you to take certain aspects of the surroundings in, relax with the music, but when it gets to the point you have to go through the same place several times because you missed something you didn't know was even there? Or you have to go back and forth between places since in reality there is barely anywhere to go even though it shows you lots of options? You can't help but want to go a little faster. I believe however that the inability to go at your own pace was set into the game strictly to make it seem longer overall, when in fact it is really very short. As short if not shorter than a free flash game online. Perhaps this is why there are meant to be more episodes to come? I myself am unconvinced that purchasing any further aspects of this game would be worth my time or money. The story did intrigue me at first, but the character's attitude towards everyone and everything does not vary no matter what 'path' you choose. She cares so little about everyone and everything, that I just can't feel any desire to care about her or her story. She shows no passion in her 'kindness' or in her killing. She just feels insanely apathetic, as if she's a monotone motivational speaker. She's trying so hard, but she really isn't getting anything through to me. I wanted to skip through the dialogue half the time for how repetitive it was but I forced my way through in hopes that there would be something worthwhile. The game was no where as 'deep' or profound as it was trying to be. I also had gotten my hopes up that it would talk more on transgender people or sexuality in a positive way for how it was advertised to have genders and species melt into each other? The most it seemed to say though was in one instance where the main character said she wasn't going to describe everyone because it didn't matter what they looked like? A statement that gave me mixed feelings. On one side I was happy she didn't care what they looked like but at the same time it felt like just another heartless statement from her rather than her feeling love had no bounds? It's really.

I look forward to the future for this game. It's got such a unique art style, interesting music and locations...and LOVE the dialogue. This game does take me back to old school point and click games where you won't always know what to do, but with a little observation and creativity, the puzzles aren't too hard. The answers to some are actually even kinda funny. All in all, please check this out if you're like me- looking for an off beat treasure in the massive sea of Steam lol","December 18, 2015","true","6.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If it wasn't for the art and soundtrack this game would not hold up at all. I see great potential in this series and hope that episode 2 and 3 learn from 1 and fix its mistakes. Also I bought the season pass which probably shouldn't exist. I have not heard anything about episode 2 so I am not sure what is happening with it but only time can tell.\n\nAverage","February 24","true","5.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A perfect balance of neon and grunge.\n+ The game does a good job of subverting the reality of its own setting.  As the amnesiac Fyn wanders the city, odd little events and visual effects play up the dubious nature of her reality.\n+ Alternate paths and solutions for major plot points.  There are different ways to handle things, depending on where you've gone and what you've done.\n\n= Short, particularly for the price.  It's only the first part in a series, so the ending is, well, not really an ending, and once you've gone through once, you can plow through the alternate paths in like half an hour.\n= Like many adventure games, the puzzles are a mixed bag.  A lot of them are intuitive, but some are just random.  I got through 90% of the game (or at least, the path I went down first) just fine, then got stuck because I just needed to ask a random guy in a random place to give me a random object.\n\n- Fyn is not exactly compelling.  She's a narcissistic sociopath, which is kind of essential for the story to work, but there's not much else to her.  Sometimes it works, particularly when she's sassing the player, but sometimes you really wonder why you're spending your time with this awful human being.\n- The rest of the characters are barely there.  They get a handful of lines a peice, and no one has any real charm of personality--which is surprising, since they're all funky transhumans and cyborgs and whatnot.\n- The writing is kind of a mess.  There's lots of pseudo-poetry, but even the most mundane lines can be baffling.\n\nAll in all, it's not GREAT, but it is INTERESTING.  If you're into adventure games, cyberpunk, or unreliable narratives, give it a shot.\n\nIf it's on sale.","February 12","true","4.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story is good, but it is a bit confusing sometimes and not everything has made sense (I'm guessing it will be explained). I did have to consult a walkthrough several times; it's hard, but maybe I just suck at Point and Clicks.\nThe best thing is the setting. The game has a powerful atmosphere that really sets the scene, and it's somehow completely alien but so believable. And it looks good!\nOne thing I think would improve this game is a clearer goal. Like, obviously finding the memories, but the game seems to want you to wander around clicking everything and using everything with everything until something happens. Which frustrates me, especially with how long it takes to travel anywhere. Then again, maybe that's just PaCs in general.\nBut I think it has promise, and I'm going to continue playing.","February 23","true","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
