I loved it on the PS2 when I was 15, and I love it now. That said, if you cannot stomach bad voice acting, this might not be for you. It ping pongs back and forth between being quite good and laughably awful, but when given a chance it has some very tense moments, and the port is, in my opinion, a very good one all things considered. There is the issue that the game is not in widescreen, but it also wasn't on my PS2 so I am not terribly concerned with it. More important to me was the controller support, which thank god was added. There are also some token achievements for those who like that sort of thing, so overall, I am impressed. Overall, if you like cheap horror or old school survival horror, download this little cheap game and have a few hours of fun with it.","April 14, 2014","true","16.1"," 59 of 63 people (94%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","94","59","63","3","0"

Well, oddly enough, a mostly enjoyable and worthwhile gaming experience...but ONLY if you've already played several dozen other post-Resident Evil third-person "survival horror" games, and are so addicted to such curiosities that you'll endure almost any level of punishment in search of that next elusive "fix".\n\nI recently played and wrote a review of the first Obscure in which I declared it a "pleasant surprise", or words to roughly that effect.  Given that I had slightly higher expectations of this one in the wake of its more-than-serviceable predecessor, I wouldn't say that I'm "disappointed" so much as a little bewildered at just how nutty and, well, frankly "incompetent" this one so often is.\n\nDon't get me wrong: There's a lot of REALLY GOOD IDEAS here.  One improvement it arguably makes over the original are the very distinct "special abilities" which each character has, all of which you will at some point REQUIRE to make progress through the game (as opposed to the "vaguely-useful-but-mostly-inessential" abilities evidenced by most of the characters in Obscure 1).  To this effect, most of the puzzle-solving in this game is actually quite clever (though asking the player to pick a tricky lock puzzle in the midst of the climactic boss fight while a monster clobbers you from the side was perhaps pushing the friendship a little)!  And the learning curve applied to these virtual "mini-game-within-a-game"s is mostly realistic and achievable, even for a certifiable doofus such as I.  The scenery is also frequently interesting and varied...perhaps a little TOO varied for realistic geography purposes, but never mind (just think of it like one of those epic sword-and-sorcery fantasy worlds where a blazingly hot desert and an icy wasteland are just a hop, skip and a jump away from each other...apparently suburban high schools and spooky, near-desolate islands inhabited by in-bred Texas Chainsaw rejects do much the same thing).  It's also a game with lots of "personality", not least of all within the characters themselves...plenty of entertaining banter and carry-on whilst the gameplay continues unabated, giving it a convincingly "cinematic" feel and making you actually "care" a little more for the fate of said characters than your average paper cut-out video game personas (off the top of my head, the Walking Dead and Left 4 Dead games are about the only other horror titles so earnestly devoted to giving their protagonists more than two dimensions).\n\nLook, it's pretty clear by now that I have a certain fondness for these games, even if this one in particular infuriated me almost to the point of electronic pulpification.  Mostly I'm just relieved that there was never an Obscure 3, 'cause you know that I'd feel obliged to play it, and judging by the quality arc this series has evidenced thus far, it would probably be almost intolerably "bad".  ALMOST.  In the tradition of the best "trashy" horror films, let's just chalk this one up as a "guilty pleasure"...even if the "pleasure" parts only seem to come in spurts...\n\nVerdict: 8/10.","July 9, 2014","true","14.8"," 49 of 56 people (88%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","88","49","56","6","0"

But I'll start by saying that Obscure: The Aftermath was one hell of a good game and deserves a lot more than the 59 rating it received on Metacritic. This is truly a unique game that has never really been done before. A mix of Resident Evil and Silent Hill with a combat system that isn't ♥♥♥. (Not saying RE and SH's combat systems are ♥♥♥ but it's not fluid and it's just tricky mostly, coming from a huge fan of both series.). Obscure gives you a mix of a good combat system that's fluid and like a classic survival horror having to stop to reload or swing your melee weapon and pretty good co-op gameplay, one of the only true survival horror games that has co-op and it was indeed creepy, co-op doesn't make a game less scary.\n\nPros:+Good looking for it's age, not super dated.\n+Great co-op and gameplay mechanics/puzzles, not too hard, not too simple.\n+Intriguing story that you'll want to know more about and hope for a third game, likable characters although they are pretty cliche. Stoner, techie, vixen, jock, comedian and goth.\n+Nice control scheme, X360 controller support with button prompts and vibration.\n+Practical Achievements.\n+Mostly bug free and stable.\n+Creature designs.\n+Fun boss fights.\n+Just the perfect difficulty.\n\nCons:-Voice acting is hit and miss.\n-Pre-rendered cutscenes are pretty badly lip synced at times or are in general not very good looking and often times in-game cutscenes are better.\n-No widescreen support at all, resolution options are there but the game is letterboxed at 4:3 with side borders.\n-Camera can sometimes be weird, though in co-op each player can focus the camera on themselves hitting the right trigger in case they get stuck on a creature or need to have each player in a different location.\n-Some bosses can continuously hit you if you get smacked into the perfect position and some boss fights have un-dodgeable moves, no warm-up animations or signs they'll be using their OP move that can't be dodged but most boss fights aren't super difficult.\n\nOther Thoughts:Now I know you must be thinking: "Wow, that's a lot of cons...sounds like a pain in the ♥♥♥..." well the positives outweigh the cons by a huge margin and honestly the camera isn't that bad and the lip-syncing/hit and miss VA work is understandable for a French indie developer title that released on multiple platforms in 2007, honestly the most annoying aspect of this game is the lack of widescreen support that was available on the PSP version which I had but didn't get the chance to play.\n\nI'd highly recommend this game, specially for someone who just wants a creepy game in general with a good story or someone looking for GOOD scary co-op fun. That game is pretty short but felt almost perfect in length for me and you may need to play it twice to unlock all achievements, I missed one small key so I'll probably blow back through it again.\n\nI did not play the original one all the way through, only the very beginning, but I will definitely pick it up when I feel like.","March 25, 2015","true","8.2"," 26 of 30 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","26","30","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lintire/recommended/254480/","Lintire","Lintire","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lintire/","194 products in account","Obscure 2 is an extremely stupid game.\n\nThis 2007 horror game by Hydravision Entertainment (now Mighty Rocket Studio) is a direct sequel to the 2004 survival game of the same name. Obscure 2 is not a love-letter to b-list horror titles, it is a b-list horror title.\n\nImportant to note that Obscure 2 is compatible with both Xbox and Dualshock. Like the previous game, I'd strongly recommend using one.\n\nSequels are a tricky affair in any situation. For all the cries of innovation, a certain degree of iteration is expected of any game with the same name slapped on it - a lesson Mighty Rocket Studio learned when they attempted to reboot Obscure and ended up pressured into renaming it "Final Exam". Obscure 2 is so heavily intertwined with the original that it's impossible to review it without heavy comparison.\n\nThere's heavy improvements - most notably, from the getgo, melee is not only tolerable but almost fun. Devil May Cry isn't in danger of being displaced from the top of the food chain, but hitting enemies with the weapons the game throws at you is no longer a nightmare in itself. The characters swinging the bats have received similar improvement.\n\nAt the cost of the "anyone can die" gimmick, characters now have variety, depth, story arcs, and dialogue, and aren't just completely interchangeable and forgettable. I almost got attached to some of the new and returning characters during the calmer moments where duos would banter. Calmer moments that are also heavily improved - the puzzles, from the minigames to the environmental work - is leagues ahead of Obscure's, despite the new action focus.\n\nOn top of all this, it looks better - character models are respectable and environments much more detailed and interactive (with an insane amount of flavour text in select areas). None of which disguises the hilariously bad plot.\n\nObscure 2's plot is full of holes, contrivances, retcons, arbitrary character shifts and terrifying CGs nestled comfortably in the pit of the Uncanny Valley. Even if not compared to the first game's flimsy pretext, Obscure 2's plot goes to insane and hilarious over-the-top places, while remaining completely straight-faced, even retroactively turning Obscure's plot into a land of stupidity. And you know none of it is ironic, because the developers are French. It is a joy on every level.\n\nBut this came at a heavy cost.\n\nThe beautiful level design  that intertwined with pleasing complexity is axed in favour of a completely linear game to almost corridor levels. The slowly filled-in maps are gone, along with maps altogether. The haunting camera angles are gone. The suspense-laden pacing is gone. The flashlight mechanics are gone. The atmosphere is completely brutalized and thrown out the window in favour of an action game with action pacing.\n\nThat's without mentioning that co-op is now mandatory - and while the AI is no longer borderline useless, you now get to watch them walk over and over into enemy's reaches while handling ranged weapons and sucking up your extremely scarce resources, and then refusing to get out of the way while attempting to explore.\n\nAs many failed attempts at escort missions and multiplayer games have proved - it's not fun to babysit the braindead.\n\nEven with the action horror and better controls, Obscure 2 sacrifices so much of what made the first one special that it feels completely underwhelming as a result. It's no longer surprising that Hydravision went on to make one of the worst-received Alone in the Dark titles. Play it for the camp plot, but if you're looking for more of the well-designed brilliance that was on par with the great Survival Horrors, you're going to be disappointed.\n\nI still recommend Obscure 2 - but it's a lukewarm recommendation.","September 4, 2015","true","7.0"," 25 of 35 people (71%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","71","25","35","5","0"

I loved every minute of it and wish it didn't end, it was a very good, B horror flick type of horror game. So then I went on to this one. This one has made definite improvements to the combat however this can be seen as a detriment as well. While the combat was improved the layout of the game is hindered and much more linear which to me is a bad thing. Story is actually worse than the first, but still in the B horror movie flick sort of way. Given how I was so used to the first obscures controls, camera angle, and combat, this game was difficult for me to get into. All that being said, I am still a fan of this series and I do believe the bundle in particular is worth the price for these games.","July 28, 2014","true","1.1"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","11","13","0","0"

The horror is back and it gets worse too! Just like Obscure, Obscure 2 (The Aftermath) is another classic gem/nostalgia game if you ever played this game on the PS2. I like the new environments and the new characters on this game but some of the characters from Obscure come back to Obscure 2 world and face the horrific nightmare again! Except this time your characters are College students. I love the plot of the game, the music of the game, and I absolutely love the atmosphere! I also love the music at the main menu of Obscure 2! But there's one thing that I didn't like about Obscure 2 which is its Camera angles/movements. If you move around or turn around a alot with a weapon out, the camera will go bonkers!

Now Obscure 2 made these two so f'ing bad, that I can't bear to play this game anymore.\n\nThe controls were reworked to some TPS/classical survival horror controls hybrid and it's awful. Just in the first five minutes my character wasn't visible on the screen while I was controlling it. The camera angles are changing by themselves and you can control them too, it's just something I think don't work well together, especially when the execution is so terrible. I have no idea why they implemented this TPS type of feel to the game, the combat is more hectic and chaotic from it, you autolock on stuff and you press left click hoping that they will die before your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ AI partner does. Sure, you can play co-op, but I don't know anybody in a 10 mile area who wants to play Obscure 2, ♥♥♥♥ me I guess. Also the enemies are faster, which makes the left clicking and AI not keeping distance even more exciting.\n\nAnd the storytelling, there are too many dialogues. This sounds ridiculous, but hear me out. When you have annoying teens as your characters who are also underdeveloped and dumb as ♥♥♥♥ you probably want to use them simply as moving flesh to hack. But no, Obscure 2 had to make them talk every 2 minutes, using cringe-worthy and overacted lines. You probably saw it coming, but the voice acting is obviously terrible, so that doesn't help the case.\n\nThe only positive thing is that they toned down the loud and unfitting music from the first game, they do this rarely now. The atmosphere also stayed the same as in the first game (not considering the constant hair pulling from the things read above), which is great.\n\nIf you liked the first one maybe, but only if you feel like you can handle the more trashy nature of this game than that one.","May 3","false","1.4"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

The game also laggs like hell for me on my high end system while Obscure I has better "widescreen support" and runs smoothly while Obscure 2 laggs, ♥♥♥♥ING LEGIT\nIt would be fine if I could just play with my controller but apprently the game only supports Xbox 360 controllers\nGOOD ♥♥♥♥ING WORK ITS NOT LIKE THE GAME CAME OUT FOR PS2 AND SO ON AND DOING SUPPORT FOR THOSE CONTROLLERS IS NOT HARD AT ALL. Also I readed online that they announced widescreen feature, well, TOO BAD ITS NOT ♥♥♥♥ING WIDESCREEN...got black bars on the side, Im seeing my mouse ingame, the controllers dont get supported, just WHAT THE ♥♥♥♥? I feel extremely betrayed for my money, I mean this is just plain stupid, its not that hard to polish the game a little up. I mean the game itself is great and incredible, especially in coop but with all these "problems" I rather download the game per torrent now cause there I dont have this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. As long as they at least did not implement widescreen support, DO NOT BUY. If they did you might have some fun while always seeing your mouse ingame..or maybe you got a Xbox 360 controller after all but im not a fan of that.\nTo summarize that: Unplayable -> strong lag on high end system/obscure I runs fine and stuff like Metro2033 too, no widescreen, seeing my mouse ingame, no proper controller support\n\n3/9/2015\nSTILL NO WIDESCREEN SUPPORT\nYou can choose 1920x1080 but black bars -.- Still continueing with the Retail version...","October 26, 2014","false","1.8"," 9 of 47 people (19%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","19","9","47","2","13"

The gameplay mechanics are quite unique though a bit wonky and it has a nice blend of Silent Hill, Amnesia and Resident Evil altogether. The game has a very good soundtrack. The voice acting might be a bit off but hey, the game's story is quite gripping for me.

The local co-op enhances the fun where another player can join with a controller. But, once again, the funky camera can be a damper on things. As far as the story goes, there is much better out there, and as a solo game, I don't believe Obscure II is all that special by itself. However, playing the sequel after pplaying the original, that opened up the story much more for me personally, as it may for you if you played both.\n\nTo anyone it may concern, the M rating for the game is well deserved as almost the entirety of the game's story revolves around sexual assault by a demonic plant created monster spawn.\n\n6/10 would recommend.","March 30","true","7.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Each with their own strength and you can cycle through them. You are only allowed to play 2 characters at once. You have to solve puzzles, beat enemies and deal with alot of wonkiness. Enemies are not that scary and the game is not really that horrorish. The game has no jumpscare which is already a plus. You are able to destroy vending machines to get a energy drink. Energy drinks will restore health. The combat is very wonky and you can't defend yourself beside hitting the enemy. The game has a story but i don't really get it.\n\nControls could be sometimes wonky.\nCombat is Wonky.\nCamera could be sometimes wonky.\nAI team mate are stupid and blocks you all the time.\nSoundtrack sometimes stop instantly or it comes up for no reason.\nCutscene animation is weird.\nGraphical animation is weird.\nYou can only play this game Local Co-op or single player.\n\nOther things.\nThose black things on the wall are save points. They aren't dangerous.\nAlot of wonkiness.\nAI team mate likes to block you.\n\n-------------------\n\nI Give this game a 6/10","April 20","true","5.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
