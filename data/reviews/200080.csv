The music is very fitting with a Japanese poppy kind of sound.  The game has TONS of stuff to do from puzzles to playing pachinko and making Bento.  This game has ALOT of content, it can be as short or as long as you want.  There are all kinds of puzzles like Nanograms, where you make a picture out of boxes, to Renograms, and Soduku.  There are 10 of each of those puzzles, but fear not there is only a few soduku things that need solving, having never done soduku before, I thought it was fun but not impossible.  Some of the puzzles made no sense, like one where your underwater and cut some ropes, the pattern for cutting them is just strange.\n\nThis game makes you feel more like your in Japan oddly than Go Go Nippon! With its pachinko parlors, and making bento, to the importance of phone charms this game has alot going on for any mystery solver.\nIf you get stuck check here, never give up:\nhttp://www.gameboomers.com/wtcheats/pcNn/ND23/ND23saw.htm\n\nRating:  10/10  Value:  $9.99","July 20, 2014","true","24.4"," 21 of 26 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","21","26","0","0"

I managed to get the game working. I will update this recomendation, once I have played through it.\n\n**Warning for Mac users.**\nThere issue with this game and other Nancy Drew games through Steam theat give an error and deem the game useless for Mac. There are many forum threds that talk about the error "Application Load Error 5:0000065435", many of which state that they have been intouch with steam, but all that Steam support asked them to do was reinstall the game or delet some files in an attempt to get the game running.\n\nThere are also reports that this game works with an older Steam client, this is true, but unsuitable as you can only get the current version. Also as this is true, it would seem that all that is needed is a new Steam update so that the Nancy Drew games will run agaiin on Mac.","December 6, 2013","false","17.0"," 21 of 27 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","21","27","0","4"

I've read the ND books as a kid but am new to the games.\nPersonally I consider some stuff that could've made my playthrough a little more comfortable missing - like a journal for a example, or at least a conversation log. It was quite hard to keep track of things without any sort of logging device, so I would recommend to keep a notepad nearby. It applies especially if you don't intend to inhale the whole game at once.\nThumbs up for puzzles, and silly at times, but still refreshingly good voice acting.","February 25","true","18.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

In some games, I feel like I really learn things and walk away with a better knowledge of history, culture, etc. In this game, they tried to put really big things into small tutorials, like origami, the Japanese tea ceremony, and the Japanese alphabet. Sorry, but I'm not gonna learn any Japanese in flipping through a book for 2 seconds... So I think they should have focused on more realistic educaitonal goals for the game, but it still was worth the sale price.","December 21, 2013","true","9.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

In this title in particular, those triggers were a little harder to find.

I never use the walkthrough with any game.  This one, I needed the walkthrough.   I played on the Junior level so I can only imagine how impossible the Senior level is.  The puzzles are so challenging.  I had to watch a youtube video on how to do the bento boxes because the instructions were confusing.  The other puzzles consist of Sudoku and nonograms.  If you have never had to do a nonogram, look it up before you buy this game.  You have to do a humongous one at the end.  With that being said, if you think all of the Nancy Drew games are way too easy then this is definitely the game for you!","May 7","true","12.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
