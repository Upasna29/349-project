Unfortunately this isn't nearly ambitious or inspired enough, and they cut corners everywhere from recolored monsters, barely remixed public domain classical music, shared AI, and minimal Bomberman and Super Bomberman mechanics. However, it's still a fun and it's competent at what it does copy and the bosses are challenging if not cheaty at times. Online is also, naturally, dead if you don't have a friend/s ready to play with you.\n\nIt's just a shame they didn't put real effort into the game to make it truly great.  Still, it'll do in the meantime if you want more of a classic NES bomberman that only shares a few things from Super Bomberman like spiked bombs and trigger bombs instead of interesting levels and rideable creatures.","October 31, 2015","true","2.5"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","16","17","0","0"

Lets get the big thing out of the way. This game blatantly copies the Bomberman series. Like REALLY blatantly. Even the icon designs look like they were taken directly from the titles. As such, you'll be seeing a lot of comparisons between this game and that series in this review.\n\nThe game is rather challenging and will be quick to ramp up the challenge from level to level, even early on. Unlike some games which will give you a small taste of a new trap or enemy before throwing them at you in full force, this game takes a trial by fire mentality. Those looking for a challenge will probably like what this game has to offer, just be prepared to adapt quick. Sadly, stages also tend to lack much variety from one another so the single player mode does get repetitive.\n\nAesthetically the game doesn't quite have the charm of the series that inspired it. The music is all taken from public domain and mostly seems rather understated. One problem that arises from the aesthetics is the playable character's design. Due to his bulkiness, it becomes difficult to tell if he is safely hidden from an explosion or still in the line of fire. Multiple self destructs have resulted from me trying to determine the character's hitbox.\n\nOf course, given the inspiration, the game has a multiplayer battle mode. and if you liked it in Bomberman than you're in luck because it's literally an exact copy of everything from those games, from the level designs, to the power-ups to the stage gimmicks.\n\nOverall it's a decent game. Not as good as the series it's clearly trying to be, but given the state of the Bomberman franchise ever since Konami bought it, this is probably the closest to a sequel we're getting for a long while.","April 20","true","0.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","2"

It definitely shines in the multiplayer department, but the solo play is decent as well, albeit pretty hard and sometimes frustrating.\nThe game reminds me a lot of the good old bomberman, that I used to play good 20 years ago. You drop bombs left and right, and try to demolish all other creatures on screen, while trying not to blow yourself up - easier said than done! You place the bomb exactly where you stand, so it's pretty easy to trap yourself. The bombs don't really indicate, when they are gonna explode, so you have to rely on your inner timer about that. I think in the original bomberman the bombs were changing colors or blinking to help you see, when things are gonna go boom - this could definitely be a positive change for Bombing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.\nThe game has quite a few upgrades for your character, or for your bombs - some are mutually exclusive - for example you can't have piercing bombs and bombs with a timer at the same time. Once you start getting a lot of upgrades, downgrades will start to appear to make stuff more interesting. I have not seen an upgrade time out on the screen, but they do get destroyed by bombs or creatures walking over them. The upgrade drop is random and can be somewhat frustrating, if you keep getting not the ones you "need"/ want, in order to achieve 3 stars for the level.\nThe controls are ok, it would be a plus if I get to rebind them. You can use either a keyboard, keyboard + mouse or a gamepad. My universal gamepad was working just fine, so I used that.\nThere are quite a few different enemies to blow up and the bosses in adventure mode are pretty challenging as well. The music is solid and I even found it pretty good at times - it's electronic spinoff of classical pieces. The voice acting is pretty witty and well done.\nI would like to praise the multiplayer connection options - you can pick from LAN / WAN and even direct IP - always nice to see! Since I think multiplayer is the game's strong suit, I would love to see a 2- and / or 4-pack bundles available for purchase.\nTL:DR you can watch me blow stuff up, myself included, in my overview video here :\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=351498863\n\n","December 5, 2014","true","2.0"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","9","16","0","0"

I would had liked that to be also in multiplayer.\n\nHowever, after you play a little you start to see behind it. It is just a badly made clone of the bomberman game. I would had prefered the squares graphics from bomberman than this new graphics which is quite clumsy. There are often situations where you don't realize if you are correctly placed, you might be 1px to the right and that's the end of it. Game effects that happen on the map and covers the screen (character, bombs, enemies) and the actual difficulty for bosses is mostly just being so OP.\n\nIt's a nice game, I highly recommend to try it as a demo with the steam feature and if you like it go ahead and buy it. It iwll keep you busy some time. I don't recommend buying it for multiplayer at all.","April 6","false","15.1"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

Very well done, I am having alot of fun with this game.  Only problem I found was the first player is controlled using the keyboard which is less than ideal... but I found a workaround to fix the problem so you can play the 1 player mode with a controller...  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73xwBYZ7L7M","December 8, 2014","true","0.6"," 5 of 15 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","5","15","0","0"
