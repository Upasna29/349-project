"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MrDesu/recommended/446390/","MrDesu","ｄｅｓｔ.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MrDesu/","629 products in account","EDIT: I've actually beat the game now, so I can give a little more on it to hopefully help you figure out if it's the buy for you or not.\n\nI bought this game as a joke and to support Japanese developers pushing their games in English and to Steam. Turns out, the people who have been buying these games from the start may have been on to something.\n\nI AINT GOT TIME TO READ ALL OF THIS\nCool, scroll towards the bottom. I got you.\n\nOverall\nBy no means is this game fantastic, or even one of the best on the market for an action game. BUT, looking at the cover and then reflecting on the experience I had with my playthrough, I'm pleasantly surprised at how much fun I did have with it. The safest way of explaining the type of game it is would be to say it's like Dynasty Warriors but with an available DMC style combo system. At a single time you can control one of four characters and can at times call in the cast of four characters you go through the story with as AI to help you take out bosses/larger groups.\n\nRegarding the cast, and ths story in general, it's nothing spectacular, but there certainly have been worse in the past. Zombies are invading Earth and it's up to you in bikinis (well, two of the four in bikinis UNLESS you change their outfits) to put a stop to it. There are fifteen different levels that you'll fight through in order to accomplish this goal, and from what I've seen, three different difficulties for you to tackle to do these levels. It took me almost exactly five hours to clear the story, but I think I'll be coming back to it to explore the previously mentioned combo system and to try and top the implemented leaderboards.\n\nHOLD UP. THIS IS A PORT\nIt sure is a port. And it's a pretty good one to boot. The game won't run above 60FPS without making the game play at 2x speed, etc. etc. Lock it at 60 and you should be good. There aren't any graphics options outside of resolution and brightness, however it's not a fantastic looking game so for most this shouldn't be an issue.\n\nFor reference, I'm running:\nCPU Intel i7 4790k @ 4.4GHz\nGPU EVGA GTX 970 SC Edition\nRAM16GB of DDR3 @1866MHz\nIn regards to storage, I played this off of a HDD, rather than one of my SSDs. Load times were never over around 10 seconds, though.\n\nAlright, soooo what's good about it?I don't like making lists to convey what's good, but it'll do. I'm lazy.\n\n-The combat. It's not the best thing on the planet, but with the character animations, the combo system and the ability to switch between the four characters to use different weapon types it feels pretty damn good. Clearing waves of enemies out isn't the best feeling thing on the planet, but again, it's better than I was expecting.\n-The art style. Yes, it's full of T&A, however I'm a fan of the character design as a whole. The creatures could have used some work but the playable characters and bosses looked cool. Take note that I didn't keep the bikinis on. I made the squad look like a TRUE SQUAD Imgur link showin off SQUAD[i.imgur.com]\n-There's really no reason for the music in this game to be as good as it is. It's honestly going to get a spot on my phone for my workouts. It's honestly pretty great outside of a couple of tracks. CHECK IT\n-This is kind of an iffy thing for some people, but replay value. It's short enough, has enough upgrades and combos to keep some people coming back and play it on a harder difficulty. I'm sure to come back and play it again at least once, not to mention it's just fun to look at in motion.\n\n\nAlright, soooo what's bad about it?Gonna just make a small list again.\n\n-OK, I'm an idiot and didn't realize I could toggle lock on in the settings, but even after I figured that out the camera was a bit poor in some areas and ruined the flow of combat/made it hard to dodge some enemies.\n-No real graphics options.\n-The levels look like poo. They look like total garbage and some of them had some confusing/bland layouts. Fix this and the game would be a much easier sell.\n\nI AINT GOT TIME TO READ OR "A CONCLUSION"If you've been waiting for an Onechanbara game on Steam, this is worth picking up. If you're a fan of action games such as Dynasty Warriors and DMC and have been waiitng for a diversion/alternative then it's worth picking up while it's on sale. Don't set your expectations too high, and plan to play through it twice to get the value out of it. The campaign only lasts about five hours. Solid combat, sweet music and some cute girls, but some poor map design bog it down a bit. $20 is the sweet spot for most passerby. But if you know you want it, go $30 to full price.\n\nYO, GIMME A NUMBERStop wanting numbers off of reviews. Read some stuff on it, take a look at some videos. It got poor reviews but if it looks interesting to you, it's probably pretty good.\n\nDisclosureI bought this game with my own cash, played it on my own time and no one held a gun to my head to write this review.\n\nIF ANY OF Y'ALL HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR SOMETHING, LEMME KNOW. I CHECK THE COMMENTS ON MY REVIEWS AND WILL GLADLY ANSWER THINGS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. MMMK THANKS FOR READIN\n\nEDIT: HEY, MY GAME RUNS REAL QUICK WHAT DO\nTurn on Vsync??? My monitor runs at 120. Turned on Vsync in game and had no issue.","June 3","true","6.7"," 111 of 126 people (88%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","88","111","126","13","13"

I love the combat, the fast character swapping combos, the music, the girls wearing only the most needed clothing items for combat, and all of it! HOWEVER, there are a few issues you need to know before purchasing this game! First, there are NO graphics options at all. So if you do not think your rig is a great gaming rig, I would reccomend buying the game to see how it runs for you, then returning it if it is unplayable. Also, there is a very strange issue with the audio in this game. It chops up often and VERY badly! Not to the point of it ruining the game, but it can get annoying at times. I am playing with a gamepad and there are no complaints from me on the controls. They are fast and feel responsive (no idea how this game is on keyboard and mouse).

Not disappointed, however, not proud either. As I've encountered some issues with the pc port of this game (listing below):\n\n- No detailed graphic options other than resolution and fullscreen/window.\n- When playing fullscreen, your screen ratio will be 16:9 (borderles) regardless of resolution.\n- When tab+shift, steam overlay will be sometimes stuck.\n- Uneven volume; so uneven it may blast your ears at some point if youre using headphones.\n- If the game is running on the speed of sanic, cap your fps to 60 + turn on vsync\n\nBut hey, the performance is great for me since Ive never crashed once. The gameplay is very fun, combat system is fast and fluid you can literally switch character without missing a beat.\n\nDo buy if:\n- you like hack and slash with versatile combat system\n- youre a fan of this series\n- 'plot', real plot is non existent tho. I know you weebs would buy anything with anime tiddies anyway\n\nDo not buy if:\n- youre a radical feminist\n- you dont like repetitive gameplay / grinding","June 4","true","18.3"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","88","15","17","4","0"

Altho not perfect, its not a terrible port or glitchy. Pretty fast and frantic action, if anything, the hits are a little off, not even facing the enemy but still pummelling them to death. its got a tag team element to it, as your other player sits it out, they gain health. So if getting down in health just cycle your players, its a pretty good concept. The story seems quite interesting. Feels a lot like a PS3 title thats 1080P and runs at 60fps. Doesnt seem to require much hardware to run either. I'm honestly surprised how well it ran considering some are having issues. It may just be just a button masher, but the variety of gouls is pretty good. Each fighter has their own style but that makes it interesting, even to the fact that different enemies are weaker against different fighters. This one may not be as polished as Dynasty Warriors/One Peice Pirate Warriors 4, but its just as fun to me. Its a must have for any beat em up fan.","June 4","true","7.9"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","78","14","18","4","4"

If you like the off-center games that SUDA51 produces, you will likely enjoy this as well.\n\nPros: Good models for the characters, Satisfying combat, Music was well done, overall good time killer\nCons: No real story / you need to know previous game lore to understand some things, environments old and simple, you can get stun-locked pretty easy if you miss a dodge or strike, AI is pretty dumb.Is better on controller because of camera movement.\n\nI would give it 7.5/10","June 2","true","1.0"," 26 of 42 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","26","42","0","1"

Great special effects; the initial battle doesn't really give you useful information on whether you're "doing it rite" or not, but once the game-game kicks in, it's pretty fun.  Flashy, fun combos to string together, both with main and alt characters.  Nice and smooth when it's doing well.\n\nUnfortunately this game's got a few too many issues to recommend at the moment.  For no reason whatsoever, if you're not doing something on the controller, the game just slows down to half-speed on me and the audio goes to crap.  The audio goes to crap often, in fact; over-sampled music will crackle on your speakers regularly.  Same with pop-up descriptions and menu.  If you're playing with a keyboard and mouse, good luck.  It sounds like several controls, including quicktime events, remain bound to default controls on KB/Mouse regardless of what you've changed controls to, so that can get confusing.  This was designed for a PS4 controller so some things just don't transfer to KB, or even regular gamepads to be honest.  They'll make mention of the touch pad and you're just staring at your wired 360 controller like "wat"...\n\nVery messy launch for me.  I may pick it up at a discount after they fix it up, but at the moment it's a no-go.  Needs more time to bake.  Looks like it might be fun if they fix it up.\n\nRig:\nWindows 10\n16GB DDR, 500GB SSD\nGeForce 970 GTX\nAMD FX 8350","June 5","false","0.6"," 16 of 28 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","16","28","0","0"

The Movements are very flashy, it controls well, and has plenty of eye candy.  This is pretty much what Randy Pitchford would refer to as a "greasy cheesburger."  Not exactly fine dining, but you might enjoy it anyway.\n\nAs for the downsides this is a rather rough port.  There aren't any graphics options to scale for lower-end systems (like my laptop, I have to play this game on my PC).  Also the game seems to not do fullscreen very well as there is a black border around the picture.  On the gameplay end, combat is fun, but the level designs are amatuerish at best.  A series of rooms that have you fight one horde of enemies after the next without anything to break up the monotony.  This game is definitely an improvement, but still has a lot to learn from games like DMC, Bayonetta, or even Ninja Gaiden.\n\nOverall, I recommend the game, but only if you are looking for a bit of fun from what is a budget title.

But the visualy are nice and the gameplay is hillarious with tons of weapons, combos, costumes and equipment. Just don't play this with any females around you to avoid discussions about how low the standarts in video games have fallen regarding gender representation.","June 3","true","0.3"," 13 of 25 people (52%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","52","13","25","5","2"

Graphics look really good, like something I would expect from an arcade, which is also what this game feels like: an arcade game. There wasn't anything I had to change for my PS4 controller, though I find it odd that in order for me to navigate a menu I need to use both keyboard and controller, and I found out that the game doesn't recognize my dualshock's D-pad, which is okay since the arrow buttons on a kb are right there.\n\nOh and the customization, lets just say I was able to put a pair of glasses over some nipples.","June 3","true","4.9"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

Fast, exciting, stupid, cheeseball, B-movie action accompanied by joyously junky pop rock tunes.\n\nIn a way, it feels like the sort of game you'd play in the arcade, or like something from the Dreamcast days. Imagine if House of The Dead was an action brawler and had more bikinis. It just has that sort of fun-focused, campy feel to it.\n\nCombat is flashy without being braindead, and surprisingly deep without being too convoluted. Controls are responsive, and don't get in the way of letting you master the various combos, weapon switches, and character swaps. There's also a bit of an upgrade system, and you get to play dressup with all four characters.\n\nThe port itself is... let's say, acceptable. Graphics options are limited to resolution (with a max of 1920x1080), but it is at least stable and runs at a good clip. Graphics outside of character models and animations are pretty garbo, but that almost ends up being part of the charm.\n\nI'm totally new to the series and am glad I took a chance. Maybe you should do the same?","June 4","true","2.2"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","3","6","2","0"

With in mintues I've gotten used to the camera. It's not that bad considering all you need to do is hit something, and there's plenty of creepy ghoulish things to hit. I'm not getting any slow downs, or any bugs yet. Combact is fast and furious. Yes, it's pretty much a button masher with cute animated females. I'm all down for that. The game is flashy, and cheesy at best.
