This is not about touching storyline and about milions of missions. Here , you are suposed to choose your character and do the best score u able to do. Many cool modes of game from defending of your position, runing laps or just find exit from map in limited time, while waves of enemies comming and trying to kill you. Game is about repeating same level until you are PRO. If you do not like this type of game dont buy it, but dont say its not good, becouse this game is awesome and unique.","December 24, 2013","true","4.8"," 67 of 76 people (88%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","88","67","76","4","0"

Plus its a great game to play if you dont know what to do and just wana pass the time i often find myself coming back to this game when i get bored and it always cheers me up, (usually i play it on xbox though) the character selection is good SEAGER is awesome and NEMO is a crazy guy.\n\ni rate this game 10/10 some may think why and not take my opinion seriously but i give it this score because iv had nuthing but fun from it iv had zero issues with GFWL either","March 25, 2015","true","23.5"," 22 of 26 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","22","26","0","0"

One of the few 'high score'-based games that I actually enjoyed playing. It was really addictive with lots of characters, all with their own weaknesses and strenghts. Creating combos and keeping them as long as possible kept this game fresh. The idea was to walk through a level killing one enemy after another as quick as you can while maintaining a combo. But not just run-and-gun mind you (well, a bit); you had to kill them with style (headshots, explosive barrels, you name it). A combo meter would then build up and you could score massive points, which was ultimately the goal of the game.\nAh... good times :D\n\n[Rating: 83/100]","November 11, 2012","true","0.4"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","15","19","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nejco/recommended/10460/","Nejco","Nejc <3 SaSHA | GG Boyz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nejco/","223 products in account","What's better than shooting people? Running and shooting them at the same time! Welcome to the Club!\n\nThe Club is 3rd person action packed shooter focusing heavily on run and gun gameplay. I have never seen game that would focus on run and gun as much as this game in single player mode. Whole game is designed around combo system. If you kill a guy, you get x points (depends on where you hit him, and which type of enemy you kill, as well as distance from which kill is scored). If you kill another one before your combo ends, you get 2x more points, and then 3x. The higher combo, the faster "downtime" (time before combo ends). So yeah, if you don't like to kill fast and move a lot, this game is probably not for you.\n\nOtherwise game is well optimized from performance point of view. However menus are very sad, they are designed for gamepads, and if you have one you should really use them in menus instead of mouse and keyboard. Also there's no way as far as I'm aware, to change FOV, which is not very high (I think it's around 60).\n\nAnother sad thing is, that they designed split screen, but removed it in PC version. There's online multiplayer, but not active anymore. But you can still play it if you get a couple friends in the game, it's a lot of fun in my option.\n\nGame is using Games for Windows Live. Yes dat DRM. 98% of people play this game only for single player, and that's why I think you shouldn't worry about GFWL as you can:\na) create offline account and just play without MS account\nb) install xlive which removes GFWL, and lets you enjoy the game without DRM\n\nThere's no coop, but there's gunplay. Gunplay is gamemode designed to be played against friends. You basicily select maps, and weapon you want to use in that level, and try to get as many points as possible. Then your friend plays, and his goal is to score more points than you. This mode can be played with up to 4 players, and it's fully compatible with X360 gamepads, so if you have 2 or more, you can each play with your own gamepad.","February 28, 2014","true","17.5"," 16 of 25 people (64%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","64","16","25","2","0"

It's a third-person shooter where the point is to run from point A to point B as fast as possible while staying alive and killing as many enemies as skillfully as possible along the way.\n\nIt's not big on depth, doesn't have a lot of multiplayer features, and you might get some mixed replay value out of it...but it's currently on sale for $2.99 and shouldn't be missed at that price.  It's strangely unique, and if you're a twitch gamer it'll push your skills to the limit.","October 29, 2012","true","0.1"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","0"

That is pretty much the whole point to the game. You run and gun to keep up your combo and to get the max score on the leaderboards. The gameplay is fun and keeps you moving the entire time. The thing that makes this interesting is the many gamemodes it has like survival  laps, and race to the finish. On each map you get the same set of gamemodes for each map. The only difference is the location you are put on each map and the different location and everything with each gamemode you play. It can feel repetitive and annoying to do the same thing over and over again on each map. You run and kill everything in site. The game is very easy to beat and is not very long. The reward in the end is you get a nice ending and all the unlocked characters to continue playing if you so desire. Online play is totally dead but I could imagine it would be very fun with friends. I would suggest to get this game when its on sale,","November 3, 2012","true","5.3"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","7","12","0","2"

Not even partially looked at its released, this is a hidden gem. Anyone who's played Tony Hawk Pro Skater will enjoy the living ♥♥♥♥ out of this game. Reason why?

Every single round played is around 2, 3, to 5 minutes long, so it feels like an arcade game right inside your home.

It's a unique combination  put together extremely well. Totally give this game a look. If the $15 price tag is to much for you, check it out on Amazon.

The story may seem tacked on as a way to bind the action together, but you're seeing The Club from the character's perspectives - they don't know much about the organisation either, only that it's kill or be killed and the odds are against them. Multiplayer is great fun with a variety of gamemodes ranging from your standard Kill Match all the way to Team Fox Hunt. And yes, online on the PC version DOES IN FACT WORK. Why are so many people saying GFWL died when any sensible GFWL user knows that Microsoft have said they intend to keep it running?\n\nFor those having difficulty getting online to work due to the 'update failed' error, CHECK THIS STEAM FORUM LINK.
