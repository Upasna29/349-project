And for those referencing the game to the 'free' one on Desura, while good, it doesn't even compare to the polish and content this game offers compared to the student project demo on desura.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tundrapuppy/recommended/252550/","tundrapuppy","Tundra Puppy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tundrapuppy/","737 products in account","Once a 4-level mod made as a puzzle platformer, Qbeh-1: The Atlas Cube has gained a dash, a colon, and even a tagline.  The remarkable thing about this mod-to-game is how polished and professional the entire package looks.  Inspired by games like Portal and Minecraft, this game has carves itself a niche that makes it both familiar enough for players to try out, yet unique enough to keep players intrigued and interested.\n\nOne of the strongest things Qbeh-1 has going for it is the simplistic gameplay.  It's very obviously inspired by early games, and eschews many of the trappings of modern gaming's superfluous complexities.  Because of this streamlined gameplay loop - find block, place block, move on - it allows the puzzle design to shine.  Rather than throw a substantial number of complicated puzzle mechanics at you, this game instead chooses to give you four basic concepts - building, powering, jumping, and traveling - and by combining them in various ways, can deliver challenges as simple as building a basic set of stairs to a complicated maze with no floor that must be travelled using synchronized floating paths, complete with a white-knuckled jump at the end after placing a power block near the end of the path.  Puzzles start as being simple - its a tutorial that doesn't feel like a tutorial at all, which is commendable - but build and combine in ways where you end up scaling a tower with only a handful of blocks and a deep sense of satisfaction when you reach the top.\n\nThe art design is commendable.  One of the most interesting art projects I ever had was to draw a still life using a single color - brown, and two shades, one light brown, and one dark brown.  The point of the exercise was to force you to make your choices more meaningful, rather than rely on an explosion of various colors.  In a way, Qbeh-1 replicates this exercise.  Rather than rely on flashy explosions, the latest and greatest shader effects, models with tens of thousands of polygons, and other graphical gimmicks, it focuses on a narrow band of artistic effects, and then pulls it off with great success.  The colors - stark whites and greys accented with bursts of vibrant colors - not only are visually appeasing next to each other, but also contrast nicely with the amazing skies; some of the best I've yet seen in games.  I got distinct feelings of Mirror's Edge and how they used color to guide the player through the levels.  The color palette here is similar, and I think Qbeh-1 pulls it off better due to how uncluttered the worlds appear compared to Mirror's Edge.\n\nThe sound and music design for Qbeh-1 is amazing, as it's simplicity not only fits the thematic elements perfectly, but because of the simplicity, it manages to achieve depth.  Rather than attempt to wow you with orchestral suites or generic dub-step wub-wubs, the music is airy, dreamy, and light.  It fits in perfectly not only with the levels - large buildings floating high in the atmosphere - but it also hits a sweet spot that so much of game music misses; it's unique enough to be noticed, but not catchy enough to become so immediately recognizable (much of World of Warcraft's music suffers from this) that it becomes quickly tedious.  It serves its purpose precisely - as ambient background sound to draw you in, but never to distract you.  It's almost childlike sound and instrument choices help to draw you into the exploration motif, and even still, some tracks have almost a dark feel to them, suggesting there may be more under the surface than what first seems to be the case.\n\nAs someone who does level design, the design of the levels was something that impressed me immensely.  Visually, the levels were stunning - floating monolithic structures that combined the comforting feeling of symmetry along with enough asymmetry to still remain visually interesting.  Each world has its own theme, and the themes blend perfectly into the levels - icicles hang overhead in the winter levels, empty calcareous shells of molluscs lay in pools in the water levels, dead leaves lay in corners in the wind levels.  Because everything was uniformly scaled (and the borders on the cubes helped reinforce this), there was never a feeling of having to make ridiculous trick-jumps.  You immediately got the sense of what was possible and what was not, based on distance and the world's physics.  Rather than try to cheat the puzzles using tricky jumps or falls, the solutions felt fair, and ultimately felt rewarding by using your brain rather than trying to exploit the physics, jumping, or collision.\n\nThe story and theme is something that I specifically wanted to touch on, as I had seen some posts about there not being a story or anything resembling it.  I'm not entirely sure that's the case, as there definitely feels like there's something going on below the surface.  I think it might be safer to say that rather than a storyline, I felt like there was some overarching theme to the game.\n\nQbeh-1 feels like a dead world, in a lot of ways.  There is beauty here, but also sadness.  Presumably it was inhabited once - something or someone had to create those owl and elephant statues - but whoever it was is now gone.  The player feels like, as he is exploring, he is inadvertently bringing this world back to life through his actions, either by literally building with red cubes, or by powering up devices with blue cubes.  The notion of power - or the importance of it at least - is reinforced with the windmills and fans in Chapter 4.\n\nSomething else that is striking is the feeling and sense of an entropic world.  An extremely basic (flawed, but works here) definition for entropy is the lack of order or structure - that in a closed system, energy flows out of organized and structured systems to leave them in a disordered and chaotic state.  Qbeh-1 really has an entropic feeling to it - the idea that the world is gradually falling into an entropic state of disarray.  Rooms are missing walls, floors, and ceilings, where blocks literally fall into the atmosphere.  Even in areas where walls and floors are straight, the occasional cube will be out of place - sticking out a few cm, or perhaps tilted just a few degrees; clearly done on purpose by the designer for effect.  Floors crumble beneath you as you walk on them.  Perhaps the fans and windmills were an effort to make sure energy remaining in the system, holding it together as best as it could.  And perhaps by our actions, and how we (in a way) organized the system, there is hope for this world after all.\n\nQbeh-1, overall, is an amazing example of a non-typical game that easily surpasses much of what would be considered more mainstream games, by virtue of the fact that everything is does, it does really, really well.  Rather than be a jack-of-all-trades to attempt to appeal to everything while exceeding at nothing, Qbeh-1 excels at the simplistic gameplay that leads to complicated puzzles, stunning artistic theme, amazing music and sounds, and incredible level design that pulls all these elements together into a cohesive unit.  It's a peaceful game that alternates some degree of timing puzzles with the slow and methodical exploration that allows you to play at your own pace.  For those who enjoy exploration, each level also contains a golden pyramid pickup which are usually hidden in fiendishly clever places.\n\nDeveloped using the Unity game engine, this is a game which is highly recommended, but I fear that it will slide under the radar for most gamers which I think is a tragedy.  It's a great example of the ability to marry the puzzle genre with a more  traditional first person genre, and still be successful without resorting to violence, being spoon fed a storyline, or the overly scripted gameplay which creates the illusion of cerebral choice, but actually offers none at all.  Rather this game celebrates choice, exploration, and emergent problem solving in an environment which nutures it.","June 15, 2014","true","24.0"," 21 of 21 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","21","21","0","0"

It seems to be their one and only game at the moment.\n\nI liken the experience of this game to going for a walk along the beach. Everytime i do i have to climb along all the rocks. Don't ask me why. I just do. It's not like i'm exploring new territory, or achieving parkor greatness, even though in my imagination I am. Eventually we play that game where you try and get your feet as close as possible to the waves of the sea without getting wet. Silly games, but they make the walk along the beach enjoyable.\n\nQbeh-1 (pronounced cube negative one) is exactly like that, but in heaven. Why heaven has portal puzzles I'm not exactly sure? I guess it sure beats just playing the harp for eternity. Anyway as you go out and explore Minecraft heaven your imagination will start to tell you that you are achieving parkor greatness and thanks to the various magical cubes scattered around the place you probably are. On top of this you will eventually notice a game that the developers want you to play and that is don't touch the water (more about that later), but as you can see it's clearly the beach. Jump around the rocks and don't get your feet wet.\n\nStory? None. Zip. Completely void of story. Let me see. There are windmills and fans, and trees and fountains, and carpet and native american owl totems. We have no idea who you are other than the fact that you suddenly appear through a entry portal and your objective is to find the exit portal. Your journey is aided by various cubes which help you build, defy gravity, activate devices or simply tranport you. The game is divided up into 6 worlds, the 6th you will only unlock when you have found all the golden pyramids. There is 1 golden pyramid hidden in each level in which to find them you will basically need a phd in puzzle mechanics or at least a youtube walk through. Each world has 6 levels and the 6th level contains a unique portal cube which will transport you to the next world. Each world has a unique theme from summer, winter, autumn etc and sort of feels like its in homage to the old mario games. If you find all the pyramids including those in world 6, the secret ending hints that there are many more worlds to come. This could be true as the developers have been promising a level editor feature to the game, but alas they have been promising that for a while and since the developers hardly respond to any comments in the Steam forum anymore it stands to reason why many have become somewhat disheartened.\n\nGraphics are superb and the art and level design really makes this game for what it is. While the game doesn't ever reach levels of sheer brilliance, it does have the workings of becoming that if the developers really wanted it to. Personally I had some graphical issues with the trees in the game flickering black lines and there were a few places I found where I could trap myself in a block here and there or even make blocks disappear, but with these lingering teething issues aside, the graphics and game play in general was inspiring.\n\nThe Music and Sound has its moments. All the tracks are fitting in some way, but some seemed slightly grating at times or not as relaxing as others did. There was one track in the game which was truly magical to listen to and would entice you to want to explore the place. The track i'm referencing is found in world 1 level 6 and interestingly is the same one they use in their preview for the game.\n\nWhile the ending feels somewhat lackluster and there is no story to be absorbed in here, and the level editor is somewhere in limbo, there is enough in interesting graphics and game play to give this a solid thumbs up. Various gamers have furthered amused themselves by entering a speedrun competition which you can only complete in if you download various speedrun mods. Again unfortunately another oversight of the developers not to include a timer in their game. Lastly it deserves a mention this 'don't get your feet wet achievement'. It seems to be only possible to achieve this if you complete the whole game in 1 sitting without touching the water, which basically requires you to never make a mistake. Needless to say with my two left feet and my absent minded ways coupled with my nervous twitching fingers, it's one I probably won't be getting in this lifetime.\n\nIf your ever in need of a good jump around the rocks session. This is a good game to get.","July 1, 2015","true","59.6"," 19 of 19 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","19","19","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/yellowlab/recommended/252550/","yellowlab","YellowLab","http://steamcommunity.com/id/yellowlab/","566 products in account","In this first person puzzle game, you find cubes that do different things to help you navigate the floating worlds. There are four different colors of cubes: red (structure - build structures), blue (energy - power doors and platforms), purple (gravity - decrease gravity), green (growth? - moving platforms). The cubes can only be attached to certain areas of the world (yellow anchor points).\n\nThe gameplay isn't difficult, at least not initially. The first four worlds (there are six levels in each world) go by fairly quickly. The fifth world is a little more interesting as you have access to all the cubes and the designers mix up the puzzles appropriately. The sixth world, which feels like a bonus since it is accessed after the credits roll, is much more complex, yet still not difficult (in my opinon)\n\nHowever, the joy is spent trying to find the secrets. Every level has one, and finding where they are hidden is what (in my opinion) is the fun in the game. It can be frustrating to get a vantage point in a level and see the yellow pyramid way back in the level. You also learn to "look" at the architecture to determine where the "best" hiding places may be. In the initial levels the roof isn't very accessible, but the later levels - particularly world six - that accessibility restraint is still true but there may be one (maybe two ways) to get up there using the blocks you have or gathering some and backtracking.\n\nAs I said, the game play isn't very difficult. It is a "zen-like" experience especially with the background music. The world is a lonely place, occupied by you alone. It does seem long for what it is and slightly underwhelming in retrospect.\n\nDifficult to recommend as there are other games that are more "fun" to play.","May 3, 2015","false","18.7"," 27 of 39 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","27","39","0","0"

Even though it really is just that.\n\nThe world is formed around blocky architecture with "natural" assets added to give it a more friendly and inviting environment. There's no story, dialogue, or text except for the main menu/chapter titles. Everything is presented in a manner that teaches the player what to do, instead of holding their hand/letting them walk around blindly.\n\nThe best aspect about this game is the... everything. As I said, it has no story, but with what it has (instead of what it's missing); the level design, the atmosphere, the music, the sound design, the HUD, the graphics, it hits the right note on every one of these.\n\nI found myself smiling and feeling a sense of wonder and calmness throughout the levels, but it knows how to be a tad more serious/somewhat challenging at times as well.\n\nAs I mentioned, the game is missing something that's keeping it from being even more. I could probably say that a story would improve the experience for me, but if it weren't done correctly, it may ruin the already wonderful experience it gives.\n\nFor such a short game, I'm probably writing too much or more than such a simple game warrants, but I think everyone should consider playing this for its atmosphere and sound design. The water sounds really wet, the wind sounds really windy, and the cubes sound really cubey. Just play it for the experience, not for challenge or story.\n\nIt made me happy.","August 28, 2015","true","141.4"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","0"

A good comparison game would be Q.U.B.E., both Qbeh-1 and Q.U.B.E. feature a very atmospheric world where the story is without narrative and open to interpretation. One of the most notable differences is that, unlike in QUBE which had some color puzzles and other such puzzles, Qbeh-1's puzzle mechanics, although varying, focus around different ways to move your character around a level. In this sense I found the game captured something of older platforming collect-a-thons, the levels themselves get rather large and many times you find yourself scaling a large tower...and add in the secret golden pyramid on each level and it really homes in on that collect-a-thon feel. This game also does a good job in encouraging you to explore, don't expect every piece of the puzzle to be out in the open for you to get your hands on, sometimes you need to look around and check the nooks and crannies to find what you need, something I wish other puzzle platformers did just a bit more.\n\nI really don't think there is much else to say, the gameplay is superb and the aesthetics really set a nice mood (the music is stellar!) I'm glad I bought this when I did and I'm glad I played it. I found the six hours playthrough to be satisfying, and despite having a huge backlog to get through, I am looking forward to continuing by finding the remaining golden pyramids and unlocking the bonus world. Highly recommend to puzzle platformer fans!","April 29, 2015","true","7.1"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","91","10","11","2","0"

Basically most puzzle games focus on thinking part, but this game heavily focus on execution, I don't think it should be called a PUZZLE game at all, its thinking part is too easy to be any challenge, while execution part is very tricky and may be frustrating. I seldom take more than 5 seconds to find out the solution, but when executing I get my hand all sweat, it requires you to jump, walking, act, PRECISELY. For example, jump across gaps, there are mass situation you need to jump just before falling to reach other side, or stand on a small cube, try to move 1mm to adjust position and avoid falling. And when you fall, you have to retry again entire section from checkpoint. Dull, tiresome, sometime annoying is my game experience.\n\nI love puzzle games that give me brainstorm experience, enjoy the process of thinking around, I thought this one will provide that kind experience too, unfortunately I'm wrong. I familiar with first-person games so in fact this game doesn't trouble me a lot, I'm just not really into EXECUTION game like this.\n\nBut don't misunderstand me, it's not really a bad game. It has unique artwork and beautifully soft music, these two are strong point of this game, many player enjoy this game, but if you are seeking a game make you ponder a lot, think over and over, then this game will not meet your expectation, if you sucks in first-person movement, then you will definitely hate this game.","April 23","false","15.7"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","12","15","0","0"

The visuals are stunning and the puzzles are easy enough to keep most people interested but not so easy that you feel cheated. Of course the puzzles do get progressively more difficult but theres something satisfying about finally finding the solution.\n\nThere doesn't really seem to be any kind of storyline or supporting characters so if thats what your seeking look elsewhere. However, with the tranquille almost trancelike quality of the sound track, you'll quickly forget about storylines.\n\nNOTE: I have not completed the game yet so if there is a storyline I appologise in advance to the devs and anyone reading this review.\n\nIf you like first person puzzle games and don't mind a slower pace or lack of supporting characters/storyline then this is a great buy for you.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cyrilpanda/recommended/252550/","cyrilpanda","Cyril","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cyrilpanda/","596 products in account","I'm only two worlds into the game but, well, there's already a laundry list of problems.\n\nFirst off, the game is barely a puzzle game. It tries to act like one, but a lot of the game is jumping, and a lot of the jumps are kind of terrifying, since you can barely make them, and a good number of them are over death pits where falling means back to the last checkpoint.\n\nThat's the thing, what's up with the checkpointing? Why are there so few per level, why are they so far apart? It really makes no sense. You end up having to redo a lot of stuff if you die between checkpoints, and it's just... really tedious. Really unfun.\n\nThe game also seems to want to make you explore to find secrets, but also punishes you for exploring by killing you a lot if you try to explore? It doesn't work out.\n\nThe puzzle design itself feels really clunky; I'm rarely sure whether or not what I did was the intended solution or not because it feels so janky and off. Sometimes I feel like I'm breaking a puzzle and I actually am, other times I do a similar type of puzzle-breaking that turns out to be the right solution? It's so confusing.\n\nThe game also has a major oversight where it tries to make you lose cubes by having indentations where you have to put a cube in, but a lot of the time you can stand on the ledge above it, go just far enough out, and grab the cube from inside the indentation, thus generally giving you an extra cube to work with. And I doubt this was intended, but, hey, it works.\n\nThere was one puzzle where the solution was literally just a hidden passage that let you skip a door that would otherwise require a blue key block to open. So that's... something.\n\nAlso, there's fall damage for some arbitrary reason. Another one of those anti-exploring things as it's never been relevant in a puzzle yet.\n\nThe basic mechanic of this game, even, is just... kind of dumb. There's an arbitrary limit on how far away you can grab stuff, where it's too far to be "realistic" but too close to be "useful". It feels like an arbitrary limitation that only exists to make puzzles more tedious.\n\nAnother arbitrary mechanic. It's really picky about where you can put blocks. You can't stack blocks down, at all, unless you have a deep enough angle under the blocks. Not just "a bit below" but "standing under". So sometimes you'll end up needing to stop what you're doing, go back down and put a block under another block, then come back up to continue onward, because of this completely pointless limitation.\n\nYou also can't place blocks in a bridge in front of you, so yep, go back down, walk to the other side, stretch the bridge out... doesn't this sound tedious as heck? Believe me, it is.\n\nAnd even then... the game runs out of interesting things to do with its basic block building mechanic about one world in. Yet still continues to reuse the same slow building puzzles over and over, for... some reason or other, I really don't know.\n\nThis is just two worlds' worth of experience and I highly doubt it's going to get better but I'm inevitably going to end up playing more so I'll update this later... I just, already had a lot I wanted to say and definitely wouldn't recommend this game based off what I've played. There's starting out on the wrong foot, and then there's not having a right foot to start with, period, and this game... seems to be the latter.\n\nWorld 3 update: The game introduces a low-gravity hi jump mechanic... that's horribly inconsistent and I can't figure out why jump height varies so much. Getting stuck on ledges also becomes a thing. The rest of the game is pretty much the same tedious schlock. I'm not sure I can keep playing much further, honestly, this game is just a special kind of unpleasant.","May 5","false","5.7"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","9","10","0","0"

Qbeh-1 is certainly a puzzle game, but you are certainly not forced into a linear approach. There are often multiple approaches to resolve challenges. You can utilize hidden paths, strategic jumps, and a variety of cubes with different functions to tackle each task. And, particularly later in the game, you can be tempted into making decisions that could force you into a trap. But it's all part of the fun to learn what to do and what to avoid! The tougher challenges bring greater satisfaction when you eventually solve them.\nThere are also secret tokens each level to find, although they are optional. Since I enjoy these secrets, I find that these extras force me to take each world with a holistic approach (figure out where a secret might be by considering the whole map), as well as an analytical one.\nThe visuals, sounds, and music bring a fresh and even soothing atmosphere to the game. Yet there is also danger: Looking below you and seeing nothing but sky can tease more than a little vertigo. You must always watch your step! The controls are very simple and avoid complexity that can interfere with immersion into the game. And you build upon your acquired knowledge as you go. You learn solutions to common puzzles, and sometimes you gain inspiration to improve those solutions. And you truly feel you're learning when you are able to combine those solutions into an even greater one.\nI truly recommend this game to anyone. Even if puzzle games aren't normally your cup of tea, the relaxed pace, beautiful setting, and multiple approaches may just attract both the hardcore and casual gamers alike.","June 7, 2014","true","88.2"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

There are 6 different worlds with different atmospheres and coloring to diversify the game.\n\nThe way you get though the each level is by using the cubes you are given to pass by many obstacles. There are quite a few different types of cubes too; gravity, power, basic, etc.\n\nWhat really sells this game on me though is the beauty of each level. To be concise, each level looks like minecraft with shaders, without all the lag.\n\nI'd definately recommend this game, although be sure to watch the videos and take a look at the screenshots to see for yourself.\n\n(I bought this at 90% off btw)\n\nThe ending on 5-6 is amazing","August 18, 2015","true","15.6"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","7","7","0","0"

Liquid Flower has done an exceptional job, the level design is fluent and flows with the colour scheme of each world.\n\nAs I had faintly remembered my experience playing the demo Qbeh I was pleased to see the ending was very similar in that we were dragged into the "Atlas Cube". The puzzles were logical and easy to understand making this game simple and quick to get through. The levels were long which was great because it helped break the playtime into sections however although the loading time was designed to be long (like I was waking up through every level), I found it rather annoying when I wanted to check what level I was on and I had to wait to exit to the menu and wait to go back into the level. Maybe including the name/level number on the pause/exit menu would've been nice. Also I did occasionally find the Z-fighting on a few cubes here and there but not enough for it to affect the game at all in any negative way.\n\nI felt a connection with each level, it felt really inviting and warm as they each had their own characteristic. I couldn't help but admire the beauty of some of the levels with the water, especially the interior/dark levels with the lights emmitting and illuminating the water.\n\nPlaying through the game I noticed Liquid Flower took very attentive care to small details upon the levels, balancing it out so the levels weren't scattered with small pieces however they didn't seem dull and blank at all.\n\nAs I went through each level I played it very wisely, being as conservative as possible and saving as many of my cubes. I was only able to find a few triangle gems, so it would've been nice if it had a record system which you can set a high score for how many cubes you save finishing the level so that way I'm not wasting all that time going back into the chamber and picking up the cubes which I can save\nSo thanks Liquid Flower for making such an amazing game.

I went back to level 1 to start finding the other 5 in the first world, and I have to say, they are really tricky to get to. They are usually in a hidden room that you won't normally see. Now those made the game for me!\n\nThe game is good at leading you in the right direction, except for the pyramids, those are a lot harder to find. But to simply get to the exit, you can usually just follow the paths and do the jump puzzles.\n\nBasically, you pick up these red blocks and use them to get to places. You can climb them, walk across them, create stairs, whatever you need, as long as you have enough. There are climbing puzzles where there is a huge wall, and you have to somehow climb up to the edge.\n\nI love the graphics, I love the music, I love the atmosphere, I love the Portal like world.

The atmosphere is created through level and audio design combined with a good colour palette, resulting in a solid foundation for a game.\n\nIt's serene and calm in the strange world of Qbeh. The slow and relaxed melodies combined with desolate but beautiful visuals gives a nice, pacifying feeling to the player. Playing this game relieves stress, well, personally speaking anyway, and I find that to a really nice and rare quality.\n\nI highly recommend it.

So let's get started!\n\nA quick intro\n\nQbeh-1 is a prequel to game Qbeh (which you can download via Desura). Qbeh was a student project, practically a demo containing 6 levels. This '-1' (minus one) standing next to Qbeh tells that this is a prequel. So, getting back to Qbeh-1: This is a  first person perspective non-violent exploration puzzle platformer game.  You will meet several game genres here.\n\nWhat you can expect\nThe game contains 5 (or maybe 6? I won't spoil it) worlds, each with 6 levels.\nIt's an exploration game, so you will not be told practically anything except key bindings (in options).\n\na) Your goal\n\nYour goal is simple: find the portal to the next level. Simple but difficult.\n\nb) Environment\n\nAs you probably saw in the trailers, Qbeh-1 is inspired by Minecraft -  almost everything is made of cubes.  In every level, you will be placed in... well, locations floating somewhere high in the sky. The sky is above you and below you. On your way, you will encounter several kinds of cubes you can pick up, each one with a unique ability.\n\nc) No violence\n\nFor some it's an advantage, for some it's a disadvantage. The only dangers you face is falling, being crushed by a door and touching poison.\n\nd) Soundtrack\n\nSoundtrack of Qbeh-1 is what makes the game incredible. It's ambient, atmospheric, soothing, relaxing... Each level has different soundtrack, and every song creates a different climate. You will definetly like it.\n\ne) Pace\nThe game is rather slow-paced, but if you don't like it, in one of the worlds you will encounter fans, transporting you at high speeds.\n\nf) Gameplay\n\nI forgot to mention about this at the beginning of my review, sorry ;)\nAs I said before, you can pick up special cubes (several kinds) you can then place on special surfaces or other cubes. The game gives you the freedom of building, so there are always several ways to solve each puzzle. On each level, you can also find a Secret Token, and if you collect them all, you will unlock something special.\n\nOverall\nQbeh-1: The Atlas Cube is a relaxing game, you can have a break from reality. You will have to jump, think, explore and have good eyesight.\nIt's now on sale, so I fully recommend you to buy it.  Buy, and you will not regret.\n\n\n\nThank you for reading :)","June 21, 2014","true","25.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

There are a total of 36 levels spread out around 6 'worlds', each with their own theme such as spring, winter, fall, summer, etc. Each level has a secret, which is a golden triangle, and if you manage to find all of them in worlds 1-5, world 6 will then unlock. In addition, there are a few extra secrets for achievements as well.\nThe gameplay is typical of puzzlers, starting out easy and getting progressively harder. However, it is also VERY fun, with four (technically five, but the fifth is a portal key to unlock the next world only found in the last level for each world) block types. The red cube, which is a structure block. The blue cube, which is a power block. The purple cube, which is a cube that reduces gravity in a certain range. And the green cube, which is a motor device that deteriorates after a certain distance. Typically, each world introduces a new block type, making the levels and designs more and more complex and challenging. Expect to fall out of the world to your death many times, this can be a very challenging puzzler.\nThe sounds and music are also superb. Each level has its own special music track, each as equally entrancing as the last. The musical score for this game is honestly amazing, and they also have the soundtrack available for purchase, which I will provide the link to (https://launchablesocks.bandcamp.com/album/qbeh-1-ost).\nI can't leave out the graphics. For as simple as this game is, the visuals are honestly breathtaking. Lighting and shadowing are definitely the biggest strong points of this game graphically, and they never disappoint. Everything from the soft lighting on the blocks, the varying skyboxes, the flowing trees, and the glistening water all look the very best. If you're a sucker for that kind of thing, you might find yourself like I was, anticipating the next levels to see what lighting and graphics tricks they would apply next.\nThe only thing that's really any kind of drawback is the lack of a story whatsoever. There isn't necessarily an obvious point to the puzzling madness, but imo it's nothing major. It isn't what the selling point is anyway in any case.\nAmazing game, definitely a must-buy for puzzle fans, particularly if it's ever on sale, and I'm very excited to play and build community levels.","September 17, 2015","true","33.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Still, it has a pleasant aesthetic and smooth frame rate, the gameplay is functional enough that the first-person platforming doesn't become too frustrating, and the mechanics are interesting even if they outstay their welcome sometimes.\n\nIMPORTANT: Turn vsync on.

It does the impossible: marrying relaxation with puzzles, without making those puzzles childishly simple.\n\nThough the game relies on a relatively small pallet of environmental and graphical elements, it introduces them gradually enough that it continuously warrants (and rewards) those who like to explore, and especially those whose curiosity takes them outside the boundaries of the "normal" level path. Qbeh-1's difficulty ramps up considerably should you choose to search for its secrets. Though they're not essential, they do unlock extra levels, and the complex puzzles you must solve in order to find these secrets make them a reward in and of themselves. With or without the secrets, however, the difficulty level will increase as you reach the middle and end of the game; you are eased gently into this world, without feeling as though you're drudging through a tutorial. Once you learn the basics and begin craving more exploration, new elements (like gravity-defying jumps!) make your progress worthwhile and your journey fulfilling.\n\nAs in Antichamber, Perspective, The Bridge, and other great puzzle titles, the narrative is merely implied, and never treated to full exposition. I happen to love ambiguous stories, and if you feel the same way you'll find it very rewarding to piece the game's limited number of clues together.\n\nQbeh-1 is beautiful, therapeutic, and fun.\n\n4.5/5","June 10, 2014","true","34.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

As such, the game is to some extent comparable to Antichamber and Portal, both of which I have been playing in recent months. There is even a reference to Portal hidden in one of the Qbeh-1 levels.\n\nDespite Portal and Antichamber having more innovative game principles, of the three I enjoyed Qbeh-1 most.\n\nAs I see it, the beauty of Qbeh-1 stems from the level design, the atmosphere and ambience. It has the feel of discovering abandoned places of ancient cultures, with some left-over machinery such as doors to be opened with switch mechanisms, cube elevators and fans (ventilators). The background music perfectly enhances the visual impressions and the "exploration" feeling. It will change at some points within levels, for example upon entering impressive, awe-inspiring halls.\n\nQbeh-1 is linear in the sense that there is one level after another, each a place of its own, with its own theme, and separate from other levels.\n\nWhat may seem odd at first, but really adds a lot to the atmosphere, is the fact that each individual level is located mid-air, sort of "in the clouds". You will often find yourself balancing on the brink of "abyss", and falling down is the main danger to be faced in many levels of the game. Due to cleverly placed checkpoints the game never feels frustrating. Many of the places feel like ruins, some of them crumbling under your feet.\n\nDiscovery is one of the main joys in the game: There are several surprises to be found within the levels, and finding special items hidden within the levels is part of what's needed to beat the game. So looking around closely to find non-obvious paths to progress on is essential in Qbeh-1. Often you'll find yourself "outdoors", or peeking outside hallways and halls, getting the tease of seeing parts of levels you want to progress to, and not knowing yet how to get there.\n\nYour basic interaction with the world around you consists of running around and jumping, similar to most first person 3D games. Most other interactions are done by collecting cubes - there are different types scattered in the levels - and applying them in certain locations within the levels, sometimes to activate switches, sometimes to build bridges or to provide other means of getting to some place that would be unreachable without cubes. These "cube application puzzles" will rarely be intellectual challenges to spend hours on. However, there are often different ways of applying the cubes - it is a creative task with non-obvious solutions and surprising new paths.\n\nUsually you have all the time in the world within the levels. There are only a few locations and challenges within the levels, such as elevator cubes and fans, where accurately timed jumps and cube placings are essential.\n\nIt feels really rewarding to reach parts of levels previously unreachable, often seeing levels from completely new angles, and often climbing incredible heights - face your vertigo!","September 9, 2014","true","45.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Basics are easy to pick up, mastering them might be a bit harder, but anyway the cdifficulty curve is pretty smooth.\nFinishing the levels are more about puzzles and platform skills, but in each level there is an extra to find and to reach (reaching it can sometimes be pretty easy, but finding it can be difficult, even frustrating sometime). Well, that's the exploration part, and is is optional, so it's fine.\n\nSome levels can be pretty long, but they all have a few checkpoints (despite that, in some levels, death can be quite the punishment).\n\nAll in all, that's a great game that I recommend.

I had great fun in one world where one level was about solving different sections by connecting rooms together and using floating platforms, the next was the simple fun of jumping from level to level around the outside of a tower and the next involved conserving cubes and placing them in just the right order.\n\nHighlights\nThings that stand out about Qbeh-1 include the stellar serenity of the levels. The lighting in particular is well designed, and has clearly had more time spent on it than most games. The backdrops to worlds are beautiful and little floating trees, fountains and foliage mesh with the clouds and light to make it nice just to look around. When combined with a calm and mildly uplifting soundtrack, the worlds become very relaxing and sombre from the outside.\n\nAs already stated, the other important stand out factor of Qbeh-1 is the varying approach to levels, and most worlds introduce a new mechanic or two, a new cube or a new approach to gameplay. It keeps you thinking in different ways and makes it a better experience overall.\n\n* The secret items are placed pretty well and most require you to think outside the box. They're a fun optional extra.\n\nMistakes & Annoyances\nThere are some small annoyances on this title, but absolutely nothing that takes away from the gameplay or stands out. Things I came across are listed here purely for the sake of complete review.\n\n* Placing cubes around edges is slow, fiddly and frustrating. Due to the nature of gameplay a "hold" button (like in Minecraft) wouldn't have worked, but some effort towards making placement around edges easier would've been simple and made these far less fidgety.\n* The title screen is somewhat lacking and mediocre. The World Selection menu in particular is simply frustrating and forces you to spin overly responsive cubes to find the world you want each time.\n* The game will actively remove your cubes if it doesn't correspond to the amount it thinks you should have for a section if you die or reload a checkpoint, which is very annoying.\n\nRecommendations\nQbeh-1 is priced at £6.99/8.99€/$9.99 at the time of review, and with 6 slow-paced levels on each of 6 worlds for a total of 36 realms, play time clocks in at a minimum of  7 hours, and completionists and collectors can expect more trying to find all the Pyramids. Overall Qbeh is fairly priced and has reached as low as -90% in sales, which is an absolute steal for what is quite clearly an underrated puzzle game.\n\n* The blissful soundtrack is by Launching Socks and you can listen to a number of their tracks free on their Soundcloud[soundcloud.com]\n*Qbeh-1 is actually the pre-sequel to the original title Qbeh, which is still available to play for free on Desura[www.desura.com] and offers 30 minutes+ of very similar gameplay\n* An impressive set of Minecraft maps with a similar theme is being created, called Qbeh-1 A Crafters Cube[www.minecraftforum.net]","August 6, 2015","true","10.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wizcreations/recommended/252550/","wizcreations","wizcreations","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wizcreations/","74 products in account","Think 3D puzzle maze and you've got a fairly decent description of this game, but you'd be missing on a few key aspects\n\nQbeh-1 is a first person puzzle platformer that places the player on a structure floating in the upper atmosphere with only one goal: reach the doorway at the end of the area.  In order to get there, you'll use various cubes to open doors, reduce the effects of gravity, or raise yourself to new heights.  There is no narrative to this game so you'll not find any purpose to your level progression and puzzles really aren't that complicated, but the levels themselves are extraordinarily fun to explore.\n\nEach world is set over a gorgeous sky scape that changes from level to level.  Some levels show bright blue of mid-day, others the darkness of night, and still more the orange hues of sunrise and sunset.  The lighting within each level is built to reflect the setting outside, so you really feel like you're immersed in the level.  It all combines to make a very peaceful game-playing experience.\n\n\nPuzzle design:\nI felt every level could have been more difficult.  The game practically throws cubes at you, so you never actually have to worry about using your cubes judiciously and picking them up when you're done.  I'd say the puzzle aspect of this game could have been much improved if the game actually made you think about how to build a stairway with 4 cubes, rather than giving you 10 cubes to make your way up.  One or two levels early on actually did make you build stairs with only 3 cubes, and that proved to be a fun and challenging puzzle.\n\nThe first world starts you off with only one type of cube that you will use to add to the structure of the world, enabling you to progress to the exit.  Subsequent worlds slowly introduce new cubes and you're ability to affect your surroundings slowly begins to expand.  The difficulty ramps up smoothly as you progress, but never reaches a point that casual players would find frustrating.\n\n\nLevel design:\nI would say that I had more fun exploring the levels than I did actually solving their puzzles.  This game gives you a lot to explore, and it rewards exploration with secrets that you can find in every level.  I was constantly looking for gaps in the wall that were at least 3 cubes tall (that's the size you can fit through) or for ways to jump to higher levels.  I often found myself standing on the wall of a level looking down on where I previously trekked just to see if I somehow missed the hidden pyramid.\n\nOf the secret pyramids I found, my favorite was probably the one that had a switch underneath the floor right before the exit.  There was a small crack in the ground that was barely noticeable, but if you put a cube on the switch, a platform would lower and you could get the pyramid.  However, you couldn't get back up to the exit unless you saved all your cubes earlier in the level, so I felt doubly rewarded for being observant and for being stingy on my cubes!\n\nThe checkpoint feature in each level is a bit too unforgiving.  Rather than remember the farthest you've reached, the checkpoints reset to the most recent one you pass, so a small slip off a platform could force you to restart a level if you land near a checkpoint but left all your cubes above you. (This happened to me more than once!)\n\nOne caution I would say about exploration is that the game not often but occasionally punishes you for exploring.  A few times I ended up on a platform that I couldn't jump out of simply because all the walls were 2 cubes high (you can only jump up 1 cube height).\n\n\nCommunity workshop:\nQbeh-1 features a level creator in case you want to try your own hand at creating some levels, or if you want to try what others have designed.  I tried a handful of community-made levels, but didn't like any of them.  Seems like people just want to make levels ridiculously complicated or are just trying to create the minimum amount necessary to get the Steam achievement.  I don't know if I'll ever come back and make my own, but I probably won't play any more anytime soon.\n\n\nMinor grievances:\nThe level selection map has probably the poorest design I've ever seen in a game.  Each world is represented as a cube, and you have to rotate the cube until you find the side that corresponds with the level you want to play, but the cube faces aren't numbered.\n\nThere is also a glitch that allows you to use the effect of the purple low gravity cube without actually attaching it to a wall.  I stumbled across this early on but played through the game without it because let's be honest, cheating your way through a game on the first play really isn't all that fun.\n\nThe later levels have a lot of empty hallways that serve no purpose to the level other than to increase the time you spend walking in circles.  I like to explore, but a boring circular hallway isn't what I'm looking for.\n\n\nFinal thoughts: 8/10\nThis game is entirely about discovery, and the developers put a lot of creativity together to present you with a fantastic world to explore.  This game was definitely created with casual players in mind, but I'd say anyone who wants to play a relaxing game with beautiful atmosphere and puzzles nearly reminiscent of Zelda would enjoy Qbeh-1 immensely!","January 27","true","9.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

In all seriousness, while I've only gotten to level 4-1, I must say I'm really quite impressed with the atmosphere. One level in particular stood out for me: 2-3, Monolith. The fog combined with the music gave me chills the entire time.\nI should note, though, that the level design hasn't been playtested thoroughly. So far in every level except 2-3 (and to some extent 3-6) I have managed to somehow get myself outside the area that the player is intended to play within, all using only the mechanics provided to me. Backtracking once I have more cubes often allows me to climb out the top of the "expressive" area that I am meant to play in, and out into the areas with flat, featureless exteriors. On 2-2, you can even see pieces of models sticking up out of the roof you're standing on, icicles and snow hanging in midair because the rest of it is being used as interior decoration. That said, this is still a really good game, possibly BECAUSE it gives you the freedom to do such things.\nIn short, I love this game despite its quirks, because those quirks just expand what the player can accomplish.","June 20, 2014","true","16.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

I may edit my review once I have completed the game but wanted to get a review of encouragement out there for those of you who may be contemplating buying it.\n\nTo give you a benchmark, there are a couple of similar games that come to mind:  Portal (which I did not like) and Talos Principle (that I loved, though it had a rather complex story line to go with it).\n\nI wasn't sure I was going to like it because a number of the (mostly negative) reviews talked about the platforming aspect.  I like some platforming games but admit I've quit a couple because I got too frustrated with constantly falling and/or dying.  Not so with this game.  For me, it's been easier using the mouse and keyboard than the game controller.

It is very similar with those mentioned titles but it maintains its own personality too.\n\nMainly, it is an exploration game that is taking place in four distinct worlds, all of them created by cubes. Each world contains six stages: you have to navigate into tricky mazes and thus finding the final door that leads to the next stage. The primary game mechanic has to do with obtaining and managing the special cubes that lay sparsely on the map. There 3 or 4 types of different colored cubes : the most common type is the orange one, which is used like footstool for creating platforms and steps that help you move into other areas. The blue one serves like a switch and is used for opening doors or operating elevators and there is a purple one that alters gravity in the surrounding area.\n\nEach stage contains a hidden rotating pyramid that waits patiently for you. In order to locate it you have to use your wits and find alternative routes that will often send you in seemingly inaccessible locations on the map. What is it for you if you find all the pyramids you ask? Well, nothing really except for the sheer joy of doing it!\n\nQBeh-1 excels in gameplay but it also looks surprisingly pleasing to the eye: the graphics are lacking in detail but they have a unique art design inspired loosely by Minecraft. Combined with the excellent ambient soundtrack, they create a very soothing, relaxing experience that you will definitely keep you occupied for a long time.\n\nIn a nutshell, I highly recommend QBeh-1 to everyone who looks for a good and challenging puzzle game.","February 10, 2015","true","4.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

I love Portal and The Swapper and tons of other puzzle games, but ultimately this game failed me because the platforming elements vastly overwhelmed the puzzle elements.  I would say that this game is 90+% dexterity, which is way too high for an ostensible puzzle game.  Much of the dexterity consists of precise jumps, which, if you fail, mean you have to restart at the previous checkpoint.  You can't save the game just before a jump; the checkpoints are fixed, and very far between, so missing a jump means redoing a big chunk of the game, which gets really boring really fast.  Also, when you have made a structure out of blocks and are standing on it, very often you have to add a block right next to the block you are standing on, which requires extremely precise control or you will fall off the structure, requiring you to start over, which is just bad game design.  The puzzles (such as they are) are usually pretty trivial; most of the time if you can't solve one it's because you didn't see some place where a cube could go.  Finally, the game is just plain monotonous, and finishing a level feels like a chore.  The graphics are gorgeous and the music is nice and serene (though I ended up turning it off anyway), but the flaws in this game make it not worth your time.  This isn't a Zen-like game at all; it just looks like one.  It's actually aggravating and frustrating.  Perhaps if you consider walking on a tightrope over a canyon to be Zen-like, you will like this game.

If you're used to playing on lower (~30) framerates you probably don't notice it, but for me it was very noticable.\n\nAnother major issue is the jumping, you seem to be falling down really fast after reaching the highest point in your jump, because the game features quite a few of fairly harsh jumps this can be really annoying.\n\nThe fact that I can't save when I want can be a valid design choice, but not being able to re-save again after a checkpoint can be really frustrating. If you fail a section multiple times and need to keep grabbing the same cubes it just gets frustrating. I don't understand why we can't save again after say a cooldown period of ~5 seconds.\n\n==============\n\nOriginal Review: June 2014\nDo I recommend this game?\nAt the moment no, but if the developers fix some things I think I will:\n\n1) perfomance issues.\nwithout vsync I had some horrible screentear.\nwith vsync I had some horrible fps\n\n2) Save points\nSome of the save points are often a pain. They can be really unforgiving and walking past them again doesn't save again. This can lead to doing things over and over again.\n\n3) Lack of personal saves\nI think this is a design choice but I'd liked to have a quicksave option before trying some crazy moves. Combine this with the sometimes terrible save points and it can be really frustrating to play sometimes.\n\n\nSome personal problems I had:\n- the music got on my nerves quite a bit\n- slow pacing, specially the first 2 worlds are very easy.\n\nThe game has some good things too though:\n- the mechanics from the third and fourth cubes cube are really fun.\n- the visual style is really cool and works pretty well.\n- the gameplay itself is  done well, the mechanics work well.\n- it feels like minecraft combined with portal!","June 21, 2014","false","8.0"," 28 of 58 people (48%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","48","28","58","0","3"

(And in a somewhat poor choice, a single misstep often means you have to replay an entire, fairly large portion of the level all over again.)\n\nAs for the VR support, I haven't even been able to get it to work, but a game with this much stop-and-start jumping seems like a poor choice for VR anyway.","March 19, 2015","false","0.7"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

You are able to place them in top of each other or on the Dark yellow blocks. You do need to take those blocks with you in order to complete the level. There are some checkpoints, so if you do die by falling off you are able to respawn here. However the checkpoint will only safe the progress that u have done already, Not after the checkpoint. What i do not understand is that you can't place those blocks below you. There has to be one cube connected to the Dark yellow block in order to make a Passage and you can't cut this away or else all blocks will transfer back into your pocket.\n\n\nYou are able to kill yourself by pressing a button and then hold that button.\nYou can't crouch but you can jump. Game REQUIRES alot of Jumping.\nPuzzles are not too easy.\nThere is no Music in this game but there is a nice calming background soundtrack.\nThe game is very Athmospheric and it looks very good.\nGraphics are good.\nYou are able to change your controls on the keyboard and xbox controller.\n\n\nOther things.\nThere are Collectables, but they are not really fun to collect. The level on level selection will show Yellow, Once you have found them all in the level.\n\nRunning doesn't feel like Running.\nThe puzzles requires some thinking and if you can't do that, then im afraid the game isn't for you.\n\nBest way to hear those collectables is turning off the music. The collectables are making some noise when you are near them.\n\nYou will lose the collectable if you have died and didnt found a checkpoint. So in order to keep it, you need to find a checkpoint so you can save that current progress.\n\n-------------------\n\nI Give this game a 7/10","May 6","true","4.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The level designs make the secenery something players should take a second to admire and differing enough per level and "world" so as to not get repetative. The level difficulty is at a point so that they are not something that you will breeze through (except for speedrunners...yes there are speedrunners in this game) because they will require thought. Add on to that the fact that there is the story levels and player designed levels. I recommend this game.","April 22","true","7.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You are able to place them in top of each other or on the Dark yellow blocks. You do need to take those blocks with you in order to complete the level. There are some checkpoints, so if you do die by falling off you are able to respawn here. However the checkpoint will only safe the progress that u have done already, Not after the checkpoint. What i do not understand is that you can't place those blocks below you. There has to be one cube connected to the Dark yellow block in order to make a Passage and you can't cut this away or else all blocks will transfer back into your pocket.\n\n\nYou are able to kill yourself by pressing a button and then hold that button.\nYou can't crouch but you can jump. Game REQUIRES alot of Jumping.\nPuzzles are not too easy.\nThere is no Music in this game but there is a nice calming background soundtrack.\nThe game is very Athmospheric and it looks very good.\nGraphics are good.\nYou are able to change your controls on the keyboard and xbox controller.\n\n\nOther things.\nThere are Collectables, but they are not really fun to collect. The level on level selection will show Yellow, Once you have found them all in the level.\n\nRunning doesn't feel like Running.\nThe puzzles requires some thinking and if you can't do that, then im afraid the game isn't for you.\n\nBest way to hear those collectables is turning off the music. The collectables are making some noise when you are near them.\n\nYou will lose the collectable if you have died and didnt found a checkpoint. So in order to keep it, you need to find a checkpoint so you can save that current progress.\n\n-------------------\n\nI Give this game a 7/10","May 6","true","4.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Unlike DOOM (1993), in which you had to fight enemies while activating switches and getting colored keys to open like-colored doors to access more of the level until you reached the end of the not-really-3D levels, Qbeh-1: The Atlas Cube levels exist in a fully-3D world in which you must use cubes to construct platforms to reach other areas, approach bird-like structures which unfurl their "wings" (I'm unsure about the function of these bird-like or spaceship-on-the-ground-like structures at this point), and, eventually find your way to the shining white exit region.\n\nInstead of baddies, your primary enemy (other than the puzzles themselves) in this game is gravity; the levels (at least in the first world, the last level of which I'm close to finishing) are constructed of stone cubes and other structures suspended in a void of some kind. The lighting and shadows are really beautiful, but falling through a gap or off a ledge will restart the level or load the last save point.\n\nI recommend this game to anyone who enjoys first-person games, and especially to those who enjoy solving puzzles.","May 31","true","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

First of all, there are no broken or unintended mechanics involved with grabbing cubes at weird angles, that's all part of the game. In fact, the game is remarkably free of such things. With hundreds of hours of game time, the only glitches I’m aware of all involve a specific series of steps that has to be taken to enable the glitch, none of which have ever happened to me accidentally during gameplay. The game is stable, extremely well thought-out, and the only complaint that rings remotely true is the one about the checkpoint/save system, which is indeed sometimes frustrating, but not nearly as much as what I’ve encountered in other games - this is a minor nuisance we’re talking about, not a deal-breaker.\n\nQbeh-1 is one of my all-time favorite games, continually teasing you onward with gorgeous vistas and mysterious ruins and strange enigmatic machines... It‘s a pleasing blend of puzzle-solving and exploration, that introduces new gameplay elements at a perfect pace. There are new kinds of cubes to be found in each of 5 worlds, each containing many levels, and then, when you think you’ve finally mastered the game and reached the end, you’re given a highly motivating reason to go back and do it all over again, this time with an emphasis more on exploration. And when the final world’s final secret is unlocked and the game truly completed, there are now many new Workshop community levels that can be played, greatly enhancing re-playability.\n\nI admit I do like FP puzzle games quite a bit, but that doesn’t quite explain why I love this game so much. It’s really a hard question to answer, but I think it comes down to two things that make Qbeh-1 a standout even amongst similar games: immersive-ness and aesthetics. The first is a bit inexplicable, since the game has no real story to speak of, nonetheless you are totally THERE, completely immersed, in the moment, eager to explore the world and get to the next magnificent vista... Which brings us to the second thing, the aesthetics: the visuals are just spectacular. I can’t think of another game in which I spent so much time just staring at the sheer beauty of my surroundings. I found myself constantly stopping to take screenshots, in the manner of a tourist in an exotic land who stops to take photos - I couldn’t help myself. There’s such a strong sense of atmosphere to many of the locations, such ethereal beauty, enhanced by a haunting, often plaintive soundtrack that creates a perfect musical ambience that’s barely noticed because it fits in so well, but which will haunt you once it’s gone.\n\nThe game gets all this stuff right, in fact I have referred to it as a playable work of art, which it unquestionably is. If that doesn’t sound appealing to you, then maybe the game isn’t meant for you. But for those who live their lives always needing to find out what’s at the end of that lonely path through the wilderness, who can’t help but explore an ancient ruin, this is for you. I’m guessing this is as close as a game can get to pure poetry, and I’m actually not one for poetry, usually. If you like the awesome, the mysterious, the unknown, try this. It’s not expensive at all, and you may be surprised at how much you will like it and return to it. And don’t get me wrong, the puzzle aspect is strong, there are some real challenges here for those who just like puzzles.\n\nI really can’t say enough about this game, it’s a genuine hidden gem. At the price, I can almost guarantee you’ll find it money well spent, and if it‘s on sale, why the heck wouldn’t you? Highly recommended, for those who are in the intended audience for this kind of thing, and even for those who aren't. Check it out.","June 5","true","157.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Firstly, the "puzzles" in a "puzzle game" arn't really puzzles at all. From playing lots of Portal 2 and almost all the mods out there for it, i can say that it's not very puzzling at all. There was one part in the 1st or 2nd level (can't quite remember) that you were meant to place cubes to get to another cube to place down, but i accidently did a very easy parkour to get the cube instead, skipping the puzzle. That leads me on to my next complaint, no narative. Look, i do like atmospheric games, but one with 0 infomation given. What the name of the protagonist? Where is it held besides ruins? What am i? Even in levels, i get confused on where to go, from the previously mention exploit to being stuck in levels for  ages just trying to find the blocks and exits. Besides those nitpicks, i do really like the game. I just wish that the game was better made. I know that the company may be a indie developer, but this game feels like a fan-made level in Portal 2","June 5","false","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
