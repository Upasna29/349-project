There are a few things that I missed on my first playthrough. 1 There is a settings menu, which is great! unfortuatly messing around with the resolution a bit broke the game, my second screen, and my steam, Some how it inverted the colors and filled the screen with dots. Even then the menu screens still were in the wrong resolution and had big black bars at the top and bottom of the screen, In game it fit the screen fine. The second problem I ran into was to do with the physics, I had alot of very bad clipping problems with a few of them resulting in my loader or what ever I was picking up flying into the wall. The third problem was that nothing had any weight or feel to it, it felt as if I was driving a hover loader picking up things with a anti gravity device or something, because they all just slid around on the floor. The fourth thing was the default music was way too loud. While looking in the settings tab I found you could import your own music *HOLY ♥♥♥♥* More games need to do that! I can see they were aiming for a realistic feel to the game but it was a bit off. When you are in the first person view you can't see very much so I use the free cam, the only problem with the free cam is most of the sounds are missing when you go into free cam *Engine sounds, Debris hitting the floor ect* The physics just freeze sometimes, the game is still running *rain falling and such* but the loader doesnt move at all. The game runs pretty choppy with fps drops about every 50 seconds. I will list my full pc specs aswell *16GB of RipJaw Z series ddr3 ram, Msi 970A G46, Amd fx 8350 Black Edition running at 4.0Ghz, Radeon 7870 Ghz Editio (Yes I know its bottlenecking right now I am saving up for another one but money is tight right now) and a 750W power suply* There we go I hope this review is less Bias :)","March 28, 2014","false","0.5"," 240 of 305 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","240","305","2","31"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ramsickle/recommended/252050/","Ramsickle","Ramsickle","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ramsickle/","949 products in account","Well I have played 4 hours of it upon writing this review. I am not quite sure where the complaints are coming from but here is my personal experience. Brace yourself it is not exactly short. This will more be a review for people who want a bit more detail of the game instead of just a "it sucks" type of review.\n\nCamera:\nPress C and get into outside view, use left mouse button and can move camera any angle you like.\nI could post the suggestion to maybe in the future put more camera control in all the views.\n\n\nGraphics:\nI have not seen an issue there either, when launching game it gives you options to change settings and so far am getting basically what I see in the trailer. If you experience lag, just lower your settings. It has its bumps and jolts here and there but nothing to make it unplayable for me.\n\n(Will also add I am not sure how peoples CPUs and GPUs are overheating, Mine are all within normal temperature while running this game)\n\nGameplay:\nChallenging at times. But I enjoy a challenge. The game will require you to take your time and go slow at times, you are not a racecar driver. But if you do you can complete your challenges, I have been able to complete all them first try so far.\n\nYou can flip your vehicles over so be careful. To me this just gets you to be careful while playing and adds to the challenge.\n\nYes some things will bounce around, but I only seemed to have that problem if I went at it like a bat out of hell. It just convinced me to take my time doing it which honestly allowed me to enjoy the game more.\n\nI find it to be a decent simulation, you are doing just as it describes. If the game made it too easy on you and were able to rush whole thing would not be any playablitity.\n\nThis game I think is suitable for people into this genre of games, you must be willing to accept this genre before enjoying it. It will not be for everyone.\n\nTips\nAs for anyone having crashes or not starting here is some things I personally found that helped if I ever get an error.\n1) Do windows updates\n2)Restart computer\n3) Launch settings instead of game, click save and play. I have had this fix errors even if I didn't change the settings, is this gamebreaking? Not really as it is a 2 second solution. (If this is your problem. Not saying it will solve everyones but solved mine.)\n\nConclusion:\nIs the game perfect? No, I am not saying it is, it has its flaws but what game doesn't?\nThe developer has also been quite active with the community to take in feedback which is a plus. Just give him your feedback if you see something, at least this game has an active one.\n\nAs for the price range, it is only $15, it is not like it is a $40-$60 AAA simulator game. I think the price range for this and how the game plays out is quite worth it for that range for people interested in the genre.\n\nIf I encouter any game breaking problems I will post it as well but so far my game is still running fine with the exception of the couple things I mentioned, all minor to me.","March 29, 2014","true","11.1"," 62 of 90 people (69%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","69","62","90","5","81"

The only settings available to change from the UI are sound, graphical quality, vsync and soft-shadows.  It hard locks the resolution @ 640x480 which on a 1080p monitor looks horrible.  In addition the vehicles are way to touchy and no where near realistic.\n\nA bit on the vehicles, they move too fast.  When trying to do something that requires percision, that is not an ability.  Most controls are centered to the left side of the keyboard.  WSAD for movement, RF,TG for bucket controls,  It just feels un-natural.  You should be able to select your speed when operating the machine.  In addition to the machines running way to fast, they bounce all over the place.  Or when you pick up an item in your bucket it bounces right out of said bucket.  It makes it hard to finish any of the missions.\n\nI'd rate it a 2 out of 10.  And that is only for the concept of the game.  If it was better implemented it would be a better game overall.  I would recommend passing on this game.","April 16, 2014","false","0.2"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","73","11","15","3","0"

The controls are poor at best, they have not even used common controls. The camera angles that you operate from are far from anything decent so the number of times I have had to remote camera just to see how close to an object is rediculous. Having a camera anglethat can be chase view with the ability to pan and tilt etc would have made it better. The game is really buggy and it feels unfinished or unpolished so to speak, but I would have to say vehicle control, camera views and gameplay really needs some work.","March 30, 2014","false","1.5"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Right now I don't know if I can recommend Advanced Warfare because of how buggy it can be. Sometimes it will connect to a match and either take longer than usual and the match has already started (even though I join before the lobby has connected) or it'll freeze whilst "synchronising settings" and then quit due to connection failure or something. When playing online, I cannot tell you how ANNOYING it is to be mauled by some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ weilding a laser. Oh, and it's not just the odd one, I mean I faced an ENTIRE TEAM full of them at one point lol. They take no skill because you can literally use it like a bloody lightsaber!\n\nThe singleplayer is... typical COD. No innovation. I mean, Black Ops II had a branching storyline for God's sake. I skipped Ghosts altogether due to the rather rubbish reviews for the PC version. But, seems like Sledgehammer Games are afraid of being risky and adventurous with a story. My brother, who hardly plays games full stop, decided to give this new COD a crack, and casually breezed through it in a few nights.\n\nOn top of all of this, the game likes to quit completely and recommend "Safe Mode" due to DirectX errors. I have like every version of DirectX that I need (and the game will go ahead and install the ones it needs anyway...). My PC is good enoguh to run this, but even on "Optimal" it still has errors. I'm talking 8 GB of RAM, Core i5 4690K, GTX 660. However, this isn't the first game as good ol' Need for Speed: Rivals does it too. I'm not the only one. But, what can I do?\n\nAlso, if I crank up the settings up to maximum and play the story, the textures are aweful! Flat and no visual substance whatsoever. Plus, it runs like poop. Oh, but do "Optimal Settings" and things are fine. I don't get it.\n\nI've had fun with this title, when the connection is good and stable. But I can't quite recommend this in the condition it is in. Activision need to promote the idea of "bug checking" and "ensuring EVERY verison of our game is up to scratch" and not, yet again, leave us PC players feeling left behind.\n\n11/10 would construct again","November 8, 2014","true","0.2"," 3 of 23 people (13%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","13","3","23","3","2"

I've gotta say I should have listened to the reviews. I love the premise of the game: you're a construction business owner and you have to perform "contracts" (in which each contract is a small task like moving rocks or picking up bricks) to earn more money, buy new machines to have fun with and ultimately expand your business. The prospect of the new tasks are fun, but once it comes time to actually do them it just leaves you disappointed and actually frusturated.\n\nThe controls are very sensitive yet completely unresponsive at the same time. For example, if you're attemting to gently manuever the front end loader around a rock so you don't hit it, just tapping the turning keys lightly doesn't turn the vehicle at all. However if you hold the key in for a slight second longer it turns the vehicle almost all of the way. One would believe performing pinpoint manuevers is a necessity in a cluttered construction yard but this game won't allow for it. Oh, it's worth mentioning if you actually DO run over the rock or obstacles you were trying to avoid, the physics are so bad that the whole truck behaves like a stiff piece wood with no shock absorbers at all and it just looks pathetic rigidly shaking around over what you just hit. The engines sound like a lawn tractor and they don't change noises based on your engine RPM's or activity, it just sounds like it's a constant idle. The music is so bad and repetitive I actually just shut it off completely and listened to the constantly-idling engine which then became annoying in itself. The graphics on the "high" setting also resemble that of a bad Nintendo 64 game but the camera angles are so frusturating to deal with so you barely get to see any of the poor graphics anyway!\n\nAll in all it was a supurb idea that was poorly delivered in every way shape or form. I give it a 2 out of 5 for the excellent concept but totally poor construction (pun intended.)

I've gotta say I should have listened to the reviews. I love the premise of the game: you're a construction business owner and you have to perform "contracts" (in which each contract is a small task like moving rocks or picking up bricks) to earn more money, buy new machines to have fun with and ultimately expand your business. The prospect of the new tasks are fun, but once it comes time to actually do them it just leaves you disappointed and actually frusturated.\n\nThe controls are very sensitive yet completely unresponsive at the same time. For example, if you're attemting to gently manuever the front end loader around a rock so you don't hit it, just tapping the turning keys lightly doesn't turn the vehicle at all. However if you hold the key in for a slight second longer it turns the vehicle almost all of the way. One would believe performing pinpoint manuevers is a necessity in a cluttered construction yard but this game won't allow for it. Oh, it's worth mentioning if you actually DO run over the rock or obstacles you were trying to avoid, the physics are so bad that the whole truck behaves like a stiff piece wood with no shock absorbers at all and it just looks pathetic rigidly shaking around over what you just hit. The engines sound like a lawn tractor and they don't change noises based on your engine RPM's or activity, it just sounds like it's a constant idle. The music is so bad and repetitive I actually just shut it off completely and listened to the constantly-idling engine which then became annoying in itself. The graphics on the "high" setting also resemble that of a bad Nintendo 64 game but the camera angles are so frusturating to deal with so you barely get to see any of the poor graphics anyway!\n\nAll in all it was a supurb idea that was poorly delivered in every way shape or form. I give it a 2 out of 5 for the excellent concept but totally poor construction (pun intended.)
