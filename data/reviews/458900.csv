Got it for 2 bucks shortly after launch, but well worth 5-10 if you are into contraption building and roguelike shooting.\n\nSo this is like a post apocalyptic cybertron planet thing, and you are flying in a space truck cabin, that you can upgrade by picking up modules (green wrench), and pressing space to enter the builder menu (keys are not rebindable atm, which is a shame, probably only playable with KB&M). You start with a basic set of cabin, gun, side armor and engines, and go from there. You only lose when the cabin is destroyed, but once without engines, you move very slowly, so unless you got replacement engines handy you are as good as dead, especially at the core of the planet.\n\nThe level. Yes there is only one level, but it's never ending procedurally generated. You have the surface, with the run of the mill enemies, then when you enter the tunnels to go undeground, you start finding the tougher stuff, and when you get into the core, unless you are heavily upgraded, you are going to die within seconds.\n\n+ Very cool upgrade/building system\n+ Smooth performance\n+ Can reach very fast speeds with upgrades\n+ Ridiculous weapons\n+ Big and difficult world\n\n- It's Unity with cheap assets\n- Needs an extra pan camera view on the builder\n- Very expensive for what it is, unless on sale.","April 22","true","3.6"," 31 of 38 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","31","38","0","0"

There's little to be said about money-grabbing, and for this cost I feel like that's what this is. For the most part, its borrowed assets thrown together in Unity's free version to create a contextless, visually noisy arcade flight shooter.\n\nThere is no opening scenes, no voice-acted introduction - you hit start and go. It's an understated approach to design that we a game can have no story or context. For the purposes of this game, its just fine. Hit play, blow ♥♥♥♥ up. Works for me. I wish Just Cause 3 was like that. The problem arises from the design of the map and enemy placement.\n\nThere's no order to it. It's - presumably - a randomly generated landscape of infinite length and width, covered with entirely random enemy placement. For the short time I played, there was only 2 enemies - small flying buggers that were really great at remaining behind you, and stationary turrets. Combat is a combination of on-rails shooter and an actual flight game, and its nice to not have to rely on keeping my nose pointed directly at enemies to be able to hit them.\n\nWhile it is possible to mod your ship, understand that along with no context, no tutorials are present. The player will spend some time figuring out exactly how to build a ship and what the various parts do. These parts can be collected by flying into some of the many hovering icons throughout the map.\n\nSound design is a puzzling combination of music I couldn't hear, and the obnoxious laser fire that was drowning it out.\n\nOverall, there's something playable here, more or less. It isn't broken, per se. It's a beginner's first time out, as far as I can tell. I don't believe this is a scam, but the astronomical price would suggest it. Some people are going to see it that way.\n\nFrom me to the dev: people expect certain things from a game that costs 20 bucks. Even other, more original, more complete games have been harpooned just for costing more than they're worth. If you're going to continue designing games, please take that into consideration. Thanks for taking the time to make it though, and please keep going. Hopefully next time you put a game out, I'll be delighted enough to hit the Yes button rather than the no.\n\nEdit: Ah! That reminds me. The reticle is a touch hard to see, since the game's predominate color pallette is warm colors and a lot of yellows. Also, maybe switch the roll buttons to Q and E rather than R and F? That might make it easier to fly without thinking about it.","April 12","false","0.1"," 56 of 89 people (63%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","63","56","89","2","0"

So what you can do there? You find yourself at one technogenic planet in your own ship, your goal is a destroy other fighters, drills , turrets etc and with this earn even bigger high score. Also when you fly you can pick up a different upgrade parts for your ship or health filler. All parts you picked up you can put on your ship, also here you can modify your ship in that way how you like. Also all changes on you ship affects to functionality. In this game you no have any limitation in flying, you can fly wherever you want. The controls in a game are enough simple, this will not be a trouble for you.The graphic and sounds are enough good.\n\nSo my verdict\n\n+ various enemies\n+ you can fly wherever you want\n+ all changes at ship affects its functionality\n\n- lack of content\n- a base price is a bit high\n- no steam achievements and neither trading cards\n\nWell this game have a enough good potential, but at this moment sadly not have to much content. The best things in game a freedom and a ship modification. But you will find here just one game mode and because this this game can change to you enough fast boring to you. I hope in future updates this game will get more content, because this have enough interesting and good conception.","April 23","true","5.0"," 19 of 30 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","19","30","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/superemp/recommended/458900/","superemp","EmP","http://steamcommunity.com/id/superemp/","360 products in account","It would be wrong of me to describe Julai as bare bones. It would need a fair bit more content before it could justify such a lofty title. There’s very little going on within any aspect of this game; it’s built on the Unity free engine and is heavily comprised of modified assets. There’s no plot, only one stage and no controller support. There’s no tutorial, no game modes, no explanation on what you’re supposed to be doing. No achievements, no card drops, no kind of progression. Julai asks you to fly through a singular unchanging, unending environment, randomly spawning one of the two enemy types the game boasts with no ultimate objective in sight. At time of writing, it asks you to pay £15 for this.\n\nThat’s the same price range as Strike Suit Zero, a tenuously similar game in only the broadest genre terms possible. Both are 3D space shooters, but Strike Suit Zero drowns you in options and beautiful deep-space environments. In turn, Julai’s only slightly cheaper than Elite Dangerous which boasts 400 billion star systems. Which is a little bigger than Julai’s one cityscape from the awfully-named Technogenic Planet. Strike Suit Zero and Elite are not flawless games, but they’re polished and professional efforts, each promising hours of evolving gameplay. Why is this relevant? Because that’s the direct competition that Julai has chosen for itself by indulging in such a ridiculously inflated price bracket. It openly invites this comparison through its own choices and gets stomped flat by it. It’s silly to pretend otherwise.\n\nFull Review // http://www.honestgamers.com/12951/pc/julai/review.html","April 17","false","6.2"," 34 of 62 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","34","62","0","0"

I emphasise this. Genesis.\nJulai has potential. It does. There's a nice concept in here, fly around, blow things up, collect parts for a constantly evolving ship, rebuild your ship, make it more powerful, blow more powerful things up, do this over a wide open world that has a MASSIVE scale to it. Lots of scope for tactics and ship types depending on what you pick up. There's a lot of possibility here.\n\nBUT...\n\nThat's all there is. An idea. This is a tech demo, dressed up as a full game. Everything that's needed to make the game an actual -game- is missing. Rebindable controls, settings, objectives, the construction area being anything more than a perfunctory, horrible mess, understanding how the modules interact with each other, the fact that roll and speed controls are bound to some REALLY strange places.\n\nWhat a shame, this does have a germ of an idea, but there's no way this should have been released as a full thing.\nIf this had been released to early access at say ... £4, and had been on the basis that there was about a year of work to do to make this a fully realised game, this could have been something brilliant.\n\nAs it is?\n\nNo. Absolutely not.
