Game runs with no problems maxed out.\n+ Voice acting is fine, sound effects are also great, you will often wonder if that sound is a monster creeping up on you or just a piece of metal rolling around.\n+ Gameplay wise the combat is more satisfying than in the original and melee is also done better.  There are some new weapon additions , but the plasma cutter and pulse rifle are still your best bet just as they were in the first game.\n+ Nice idea with the space suit, that implements interesting gameplay elements.\n+ Some clever puzzles, although not that challenging.\n+ Hard Core mode is unlocked after you finish the game at least once and in addition to tougher enemies and fewer supplies, you can save your progress only 3 times.\n\n- Game is faster paced than the original, maybe faster than what a horror game should be.\n- After a while enemies become predictable, both the way they appear and the way they fight.\n- Multiplayer is nothing special.\n\nA classic action/horror game , a beautiful single player experience, even though it's a linear and after a while a predictable one, a game i recommend to everyone who is looking for a solid single player and intense experience.","November 25, 2013","true","17.3"," 198 of 215 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","198","215","0","4"

It takes everything the original put into the series, and enhances it. The controls are more precise, smooth and convenient (with the addition of a single button health and stasis refill system), the visuals are even more detailed and gritty, the sound is as creepy as ever, and the story remains intriguing and intense. You must work to unravel the truth behind the Sprawl (the game's setting), Unitology and Necromorphs, as well as battling (literally) horrific hallucinations and delusions from an alien form of dementia. If you are a fan of the first, then you will definitely enjoy this.\n\nWhile the base game mechanics are not terribly different from many over-the-shoulder style third person shooters, several aspects are worth mentioning. One of the hallmarks of Dead Space 2 is that it forces players to use weapons to defeat enemies in a different way. In a time when headshots are the gold standard for 99% of games, Dead Space 2 requires players to sever limbs in order to defeat enemies--well-placed head shots will get you nowhere. This is a refreshing change of pace, as the dismemberment strategy will change based on enemy type (there are several), and thus every battle becomes much more tactical. There are also a wide variety of unique weapons to choose from, and each weapon will serve a different purpose in your arsenal, depending on how you want to fine tune your Necromorph killing strategy. Puzzles are frequent enough to serve as welcome breaks from the tense action, but not too frequent to become annoying.\n\nAtmosphere was my main draw to DS1 and now DS2. Visceral Games has managed to create this incredibly immersive environment that manages to literally keep me trying to be prepared for what they may throw at me next. In my opinion, the number one contributor to creating such an unrivaled level of atmosphere is the sound design. Anyone who plays this game owes it to themselves to have it on a good home theater system or at least some good quality headphones. The surround sound not only adds to the spookiness of the game, but delivers vital information of approaching creatures. Even in areas with no baddies to kill, the sounds of metallic creaks, cracks and scrapes in the Sprawl's ventilation system let you know you're never safe. Indeed DS2 has some cheap scares, but they're so well timed and not always predictable that I have a hard time believing someone who says they never jumped during a play through.\n\nThe music is well composed, and only adds to the atmosphere. The music is also well timed and sometimes gives you the impression that something large is coming. Sometimes it never happens, while other times it does. It manages to build levels of tension and keep you on your toes, never taking for granted the next dark hallway, for a necro is commonly waiting in unseen corners.\n\nOverall, I thoroughly enjoyed Dead Space 2. One does not have to be familiar with the first to enjoy this, as there is a "Previous on Dead Space" menu option available to bring newcomers up to par; however, to get the most from the story, I would highly recommend it.","December 22, 2013","true","10.7"," 168 of 191 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","168","191","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/47780/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2819 products in account","Dead Space 2 is the follow on from the original Dead Space, a survival horror action game.  The game was released in 2011.  The plot is set three years after the events of Dead Space 1, and we are playing again as Isaac Clarke. This time we get to hear his voice though!\n\nLike the original, you play in a third-person perspective looking just over the right hand shoulder. Pretty much everything gameplay wise is identical to the original too. The only change I did come across is that all of the weapons and suite upgrades are all unlocked from the start which I thought was a little odd, I just stuck with a trusty pulse rifle rather than gungho with a flamethrower... The hacking system is again done very well here, slightly different to #1 but still just as compelling and simple enough to complete.\n\nThe graphics are also slightly better here; this game is made using the Visceral Engine (unlike the first), which some may be familiar with if they have played the Battlefield series of games. This game does look phenomenal though; even now at four years old.\n\nStory wise follows on from the first game, I would say you need to play the original if you want to understand what is happening as I think it would leave you with lots of unanswered questions if you don't. I'm not sure what else they can do with the story; however I will surely find out when I play the third in the series soon. That being said; I finished the game in two sittings which for me that is quite an achievement and means the story had me immersed straight away.\n\nAs Dead Space 1 had, Dead Space 2 has amazing audio too; jump scares, screams, music changes, all of it adds up to make this a horror experience you won't forget in a long time. If you don't find jump scares frightening, you probably won't find any other aspect of the game scary though.\n\nWe have a couple of difficulty settings; I would not recommend Easy mode unless you are purely playing for the story as you will not die when playing. Once you complete the game you also unlock an even harder mode to playthrough.\n\nAll of the levels are well designed and include lots of corridors swarming with activity in for you to explore for extra pickups and ammo. Some of the areas are the same ones as in the first, but this is very minimal and only used for story reasons.\n\nA full playthrough of Dead Space 2 took me about thirteen hours, which is a similar time to the first. I am perfectly happy with the amount of content the game has to offer, it is a linear story mode so I wouldn't expect any more time wise. There is a hint of replay-ability with new game+ modes, but realistically I don't see there being another reason to play it more than once.\n\nNo massive technical problems while playing; the only issue I had was the game plays at 30 fps. However this can be changed using nVidia or AMD card options,a link to this how to guide here:\n\nhttp://solidlystated.com/software/dead-space-2-30-fps-limit-bypass/\n\nI would also note that the Steam store for this game says it uses a 3rd party DRM called Tages, however I do not think it is used anymore, I have no software installed, nor do I get any prompts for it in game. I think it is safe to ignore that warning now.\n\nIn conclusion, Dead Space 2 is an absolutely stunning sequel in the Dead Space series; I loved this game just as much as the first. I really recommend people give this game ago if they haven't already.\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Only recommended when on sale\n3) Recommended\n4) Highly recommended\n5) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nbx3k/recommended/47780/","Nbx3k","Sanji","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nbx3k/","307 products in account","After playing this game a few times through, I found that it is one of the most realistic and most terrifying horror experiences ever created, I'm here to review it.\n\nOverview:\nDead Space™ 2 is an extremely realistic horror experience that is, in my opinion, the best in the series. This is because of its outstandingly realistic visuals, sounds and jump-scares that will keep you on the edge of your seat all of the way through your experience. It has an amazing storyline (that you really need to play the first game to understand) and I would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of horror, and I'm here to tell you why.\n\nPresentation:\nDead Space™ 2 has some of the most outstanding visuals in any horror game I've ever seen. Horror games aren't even meant to look realistic! They usually just scare you with jump-scares and extremely scary sounds. This game does a lot more than that, and that's why it's my favourite in the series. It has amazing detail, from hovering around space to stomping on necromorph corpses, or even seeing a man getting possessed from behind by some huge-claw wielding monster. Even changing into a different suit looks amazing! If you're one of those people who is usually fussy with bad graphics and you want something more realistic-looking, this is definitely one of the games for you. But these graphics aren't the only amazing thing about this game, there is much, much more that makes this my favourite horror game to date.\n\nGameplay:\nNow here is where Dead Space™ 2 never fails to impress, the gameplay. From quick-time events that require you to press/mash a certain key to save your skin - to shooting off a necromorph's legs with a Plasma Cutter. This games' gameplay aspect definitely didn't fail to impress me. Well, running around in a straight-jacket away from man-eating monsters is always fun, especially when you jump right into it. This game jumps right into action, this is what I really love! When you really don't expect it, you could be mauled by a huge boss from nowhere, or even just a gunship commanded by people who want you dead. This game also has a great inventory system, (requiring you to be away from necromorphs to actually open it safely) which helps you keep track of your weapons, ammo and highly-profitable conductors. These can all be sold at stores for credits, which can be used to buy other weapons, suits and nodes. (to upgrade your RIG) Your RIG helps you to stay alive, you can upgrade it using power nodes. This is one thing that is more in-depth than it was in the original Dead Space™, (along with a much wider variety of suits/armour) you can upgrade weapons and your RIG with these power nodes that you can either buy or scavenge from around the Dead Space™ world. The best part of this game in my opinion is stomping on necromorphs after they're down to collect their loot, now who wouldn't say that's fun? I'm guessing people who aren't utterly crazy, and if you've already played this game; you must be!\n\nVerdict/Summary:\nDead Space™ 2 is the most realistic and terrifying experiences to date, (in my opinion of course) I'm sure a lot of the people who have already played and completed this game many times would agree with that statement. This game proves that you don't need an open-world to have an amazing game! If you want jump-scares, action and realistic gameplay with an amazing plot/storyline; this is definitely the game for you.\n\n9.5/10: Amazing!\n\nPros:\nAmazingly realistic visuals\nLots of action\nGreat story\nFlawless gameplay\n\nCons:\nLinear Storyline\n\nI recommend this to anyone who enjoys horror!","January 22, 2014","true","19.3"," 162 of 196 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","162","196","0","13"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/deathbomb1/recommended/47780/","deathbomb1","Dirk Dickbutt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/deathbomb1/","389 products in account","Dead Space 2 is pretty cool, I guess.\n\nSet a few months after the events of Dad Space, a reverse horror game where an irate Space Engineer violently hunts and exterminates Space Zombies aboard a Space Ship orbiting a Space Planet with about as much efficiency and brutality as you would expect from someone who never has a chance to use his degree outside of murder.\n\nYou once again play as Isaac Clarke, the galaxy's most notorious mass murderer born from two dads. Isaac is less than sane after the events of the first game and is put into a holding cell aboard a space station city while constrained with a  straitjacket in hopes of containing his endless blood lust.\n\nIt didn't.\n\nAbout two minutes into the game, Isaac is awoken by a crazy man who wishes to release the eternal man slayer from his confines. Unfortunately, Issac's devout follower is attacked by an infector (That's what the wiki calls them, don't hold me to it.) and turns him into a horrible space monster. A space monster that Isaac promptly headbutts in the face and knocks flat on it's ♥♥♥. Honestly, they could have just kept Isaac from being able to use his arms through the entire game just to make it fair.\n\nNow, I played Dad Space and Dads Space back to back over the course of a few days now. And I immediately noticed a difference between the two. For one, I personally preferred using a controller during Dad Space because the aiming felt sluggish with a mouse. This is gone in Dads Space, now that Isaac apparently remembered he's the only competent person in the galaxy and quick shoots like a master. It's almost like he's been shooting at these things for two games now or something.\n\nThe second game was developed by Visceral games as opposed to Redwood. They must have taken criticisms from the first game to heart because, not only can Isaac still punch a zombies head clean off it's body, but he's also stronger, faster, and a better shot than he was in the first game. If the Earth government was smart they would stop trying to clone the marker  and instead Clone Isaac Clarke, effectively making an unstoppable super soldier army that also knows how a ship engine works.\n\nBut honestly, at this point, I'm 100% sure that either someone at EA or their developer teams have no idea how a horror game should work. The Ishimura wasn't really all that spooky, sure, but it was fun to explore. There was this almost classic Resident Evil vibe to going from room to room and robbing dead people while going through their personal diaries.\n\nBut Titan Station is just too linear for it's own good. It feels like you're being led down a long hallway with a few branches now and then rather than exploring a space station. It keeps the plot moving forward, sure, but they could have padded it out better with more audio logs to discover and maybe even some survivors every now and then. In the original Dad Space, Isaac would sometimes run into a survivor on the Ishimura, sure they usually died or were way past the point of return, but it made the Ishimura feel like a place people actually lived and worked on for months at a time.\n\nAfter a few chapters in the beginning of the game, Titan Station just kind of empties out, something I can't believe considering big the space city is supposed to be. Unless there was free chipotle being handed out earlier and everyone just had to go to the bathroom all at once, I don't get how so many people would have been evacuated or killed so quickly.\n\nOh, and Isaac talks now. I mean, he had a single line in the first game, but now he can speak full sentences that aren't just grunting and yelling loudly. Also, he no longer runs like a girl, good on you, Isaac.\n\nBut should you play Dads Space?\n\nThat depends, how much do you like shooting stuff? Dad Space isn't really a frightening series, I mean, it isn't to me. Dads Space itself is a solid game with some questionable design choices. I mean, near the end of the game there's an on rail shooting segment. Come on, guys.\n\nSome disturbing imagery stands out, like the crying baby behind an apartment door which implies the parents either abandoned it or were killed before hand. Or the guy in the beginning of the game that wiped his own dooky on the floor. No, I'm serious, I even took a screenshot, here it is. http://i.imgur.com/2ZrRKga.jpg\nThat's crazy, is that how you want to be remembered? The guy who died wiping his poo poo on the walls? Who's idea was that? Was it you, Steve Papoutsis: lead producer of Dead space 2? Are you the doo doo guy?\n\nIf you like the series, then why are you even reading this? But if you want to get into the series and liked the first one? You'll probably like Dads Space's gameplay more than Dad Spaces but probably not the setting and atmosphere.\n\nDad's Space gets 5 Engineers cussing while stomping boxes out of 6.\n\nAnd now I move on to Dad3 Space while we wait for Dad Resurrection Space.\n\nThe curator, I assure you I spend a lot less time talking about poop walls here: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Dickbuttexperience#curation","November 3, 2015","true","8.0"," 101 of 121 people (83%) found this review helpful 98 people found this review funny","83","101","121","98","14"

Launch Trailer - YouTube\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=776fi2I8e6U\n\nRight as allways down to the brass tac's of the game and first of the most important aspect for this game the story.Now i for one was wondering how they would carry on the story and for the second part of what has so far been a trilogy they have hit the nail on the head.\nIs the story in this game told as well as in the first?????,yes and no is the answer and i will explain why on both points.\nWhen i say yes it makes me happy to say that,as this was one game i didnt want them to mess up on and i am happy to say they didnt and the story flow's and take's you on a journey that (if your a fan of the original) you wont forget.Now let me explain why i said no,i really enjoyed the first game and the story but i dont remember Isaac being (for use of a better term) "a potty mouth".Now im not a prude (far from it) but i find the change in Isaac not one that i appriciated or liked but i must say i didnt find that it put me of at all (but it was there in the back of my mind whilst playing).\nNow to say more about what goes on than i allready have will not only spoil all the surprise's the game has in store for you but also all the terror and sheer shock's you will get from discovering it on your own (and you would'ent want those spolit now would you????).\nNow the sound in game (just like in the first game) really does a fantastic job of building tension and really does help to move the game along and without it,it just wouldent be the same game and experience that it is,and it will also creep into your psyche as you play to the point where you dont notice its there and it meld's into the background.\n\n"Dead Space 2", full HQ Original Videogame Score (OST) + ...\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4k485wbOBR4\n\nThe graphic's in this game really do a superb job of putting you in Isaac's shoes (well space-boots) in a situation so dire with creature's that can only be described as coming from your nightmare's being brought to life as they not only look horrific but there are different type's and each one has their own animation and attack style's to make each encounter memorable.\nThe animation during Isaac's death scene's are at one all different enough (when you die at the hand's of different enemies that is) that you wont tire of them but at the same time you wont want to see them as some are (not to put to finer point on it) horrific!!!!!!!\nThe art design for the sprawl has also been thought out well and to be honest it doesnt feel like a space station but more like one huge gigantic haunted house with you as a very unhappy and terrified customer.As you wander around you will find yourself looking at the design of the space station and wondering if at any moment it will also actually come to life and try to claim your soul and your sanity.\nNow the gameplay does feel familiar but the game does actually seem more combat based than the first and allthough this has upset some for me i found it not to be a problem.It doesnt effect the story in any way and if anything when facing of against larger numbers of Necropmorph's it actually seem's to bump up the tension rather than diminish it.\nUnlike its predecessor,Dead Space 2 has a multiplayer mode,pitting human character's against Necromorph's across the Sprawl and this offer's more needed replayability for the game as you choose whether to fend of the dreaded creature's or try to infect the hapless humans,and this game mode play's out really well and yet it just hasent been thought out and implemented as well as it could have been (might just be me),but Dead Space in my eyes is meant to be a solo experience and one to be enjoyed scared to death on your own.\nNow the one thing that i remember most about the first game was the ending and this game does try to play a little trick on you at the end and............................will we make it "What" (WELL NOT SAYING).\n\nSPOILER ALERT*****IF YOU WANT TO DISCOVER THE ENDING FOR YOURSELF DONT WATCH*****SPOILER ALERT\n\nDead Space 2 Final Boss Fight, Ending, And Bonus Ending ...\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wQVjgYyB-c\n\nOk so as allways in closing will you want to play this game or even revisit it if you've allready finished it,well answer the following question's and you decide -\n\n1 - Did you enjoy the first game and want more of the same?????\n2 - Do you want to play a well thought out game and one that throw's scare's both of the jump variety and otherwise at you?????\nAnd 3 - Are you looking for one of the best action horror games that this genre can throw your way?????\nIf you answer'ed yes to the question's above then what are you waiting for let the "MARKER" claim your soul again if not then just remember allways and i mean allways check the corner of your eye as this game may just creep up on you yet.\n\n(I DO NOT OWN ANY OF THE CLIPS OF VIDEOS PUT UP IN THIS REVIEW AND THEY BELONG TO THEIR RESPECTIVE OWNERS AND ARE THEIRS BY COPYRIGHT)","November 29, 2014","true","11.8"," 94 of 120 people (78%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","78","94","120","5","4"

I must say that I liked this one a little better in some parts, although most of the horror from the first game is gone (some jumpscares here and there but overall the fear element is removed, which is good because nothing can surprise us now after the first time).\n\nThe Steam version has all the DLC bundled, and has all the goodies unlocked, so you'll just grab one or two suits along the game and that's it, you won't be too tempted with the schematics. You can disable this though, or just ignore the suits, if you want to have a bigger challenge.\n\nThe story is superb and the gameplay is really good.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lunar_Industries/recommended/47780/","Lunar_Industries","GERTY","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lunar_Industries/","643 products in account","Dead Space 2 takes place in 2511 on Titan Station, also known as The Sprawl orbiting Saturn's largest moon. It's been three years since the events of the first Dead Space game. CEC Engineer: Isaac Clarke awakens in a hospital, suffering from hallucinations of his troubled past. During his awakening, the civilian space station is subsequently plagued with a deadly alien outbreak little to be known as the Necromorph infestation. The living, breathing, nightmare encountered previously has made a return for the worst. It's up for Isaac, as well as a small band of survivors to put a stop to this, once again.\n\nAlong the way Clarke battles his inner demons caused by widespread dementia. The effects caused by a man-made artifact with alien origin, known as the Red Marker. Dead Space 2 has an incredible atmosphere. Although the storyline within the sequel isn't as deep or intriguing as the first installment, this by anymeans does not halt the experience. The length of the campaign is reasonable, most will find themselves spending a fair share of hours collecting data and enjoying all 15 chapters, slowly piecing the story together.\n\nThis series in particular is primarily a thirdperson shooter. Dead Space 2 features a HUD that quite frankly, stands out from most others. The R.I.G. and Kinesis Module can be found on the back of Clarke's suit, while the ammunition meter is shown on the side of your tool or weapon. 360° camera movements are available, so you can watch your guard throughout every dark corner of The Sprawl. This feature is also great for taking professional looking screenshots. The game includes a limited amount of cutscenes, so you're never dragged too far away from the excitement.\n\nThe visuals are beautifully done, making the game a real treat to explore. The combat system is pretty basic, although dismembering your enemies can be extremely satisfying. There are no loading screens in-game unless you happen to die, so you are fighting for your survival none stop. The game also includes more character interaction and lengthier dialog than in the previous title. There's also  just as many environments containing puzzles throughout DS2, as there was in DS1 to put Isaac Clarke's Engineering skills to the test.\n\nJason Graves composed an outstanding soundtrack, the sound design makes the experience so much more effective. If you listen carefully enough while idling you will hear unearthly screeches and survivors whispering; sooner or later this will increase the tension. Zero-G areas in-game have been vastly improved compared to in DS1. There are also a wider variety of unlockables throughout the game. Upgrading your weapons at the bench, or purchasing items from the store is always fun and interesting. If you happen to lose track of where you are going not to worry, the Locator will help guide you through any situation.\n\nDead Space 2 includes a variety of difficulty modes, both appealing to casual and hardcore gamers alike. These modes include: Casual, Normal, Survivalist, Zealot and Hardcore. Adding more replay value to the game, the developers created an unlockable weapon known as the Hand Cannon. This is available to anyone who completes DS2 on hardcore difficulty.\n\nIn DS1 Isaac never spoke, which was tolerable to some extent. However he has now been granted a voice. Clarke reacts more often to scares than he previously did in DS1; this makes a great addition. Gunner Wright does a fantastic job portraying Isaac. Some scenes in DS2 can be fairly emotional, really hitting you at the right times; the player will care about the protagonist, pitying Clarke more so than in the previous game. The supporting cast of characters also do a great effort throughout. As we progress further into the story we learn more about them. Unfortunately for Isaac you can never trust everyone, he learns this the hard way.\n\nRemember folks there's always Peng!\n\n\nIf you're searching for an exciting sci-fi horror experience I suggest you look no further.","October 18, 2013","true","199.7"," 53 of 66 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","53","66","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/8799644/recommended/47780/","8799644","Vegetarian Atheist","http://steamcommunity.com/id/8799644/","508 products in account","The title says "Dead Space 2", however, the game places as if it was "Dead Space 1.5" - and don't get me wrong, that is not a bad thing. The first game was nearly flawless in a sense of re-launched the survivor horror genre. The second game succeeds in reigniting the experience of the first game and adding new useful elements.\n\nI remember playing Cold Fear. It's a great game with insanely crappy controls on par with Resident Evil and the constantly changing camera view. While playing Cold Fear, I recall that the only real effective way to stay alive and progress in the game quickly was by walking and aiming at the same time. That way, you would actually prevent the constant camera changing views as well as cumbersome controls. As sad as that may be, I found myself doing a lot of that in Dead Space 2, but then again, in Cold Fear you were not in constant danger of being jumped by a monster from behind the corner. The controls become much more smoother and responsive when you walk and aim at the same time, and I think that is a crappy control design, both for PC players and probably the console players.\n\nI feel sorry for left-handed people here since this game only has the right over-the-shoulder view. I mean, how hard is it to give the option of switching the view?\n\nIt is very welcome to be able to hear Isaac's voice this time. Playing as a mute in video games is a slight immersion killer, at least in my case.\n\nAlso, in the first game, Isaac would start walking on the diagonal line, wherever you were trying to walk diagonally by pressing W and S or W and A. When you try to do that in the second game, the angle at which Isaac starts walking is barely noticeable, it still feels as if he is walking straight up instead of making a slight left or right - you'll know what I am talking about.\nNow in order for you to turn anywhere effectively, you'd have to use your mouse, and to be honest, I don't remember too many games doing that, with the exception of Cold Fear, Resident Evil 4 and 5.\n\nBut back to the positive things:\nI know this is cliche but the graphics are exceptionally well done and extremely detailed - you will see for yourself. The shadows, the lightening are flawless to say the least.\n\nThe game is scary, but you knew that already. I think the first game was many times scarier than the last two Resident Evil games. The second game will definitely put some small temporary dents in your psyche. I found myself jumping and cursing repeatedly.\n\nThe physics work like they would in the actual world, and the telekinesis ability would probably solve most of your problems.\n\nThe music in this game is a must. When I play this game for the second time, I'll probly play without the music, since it always kills the immersion for me, but on the other hand, a large portion of the scares in the game are contingent upon the "music" if you can call it that. The downside is that the constant screeching music can be a give away, since it subsides when you kill enemies in your immediate area, just like in the first game.\n\nThe sound is one of the pillars of this game, and it's probably where the heart of this game is. You constantly hear the distant growls as well as scratching in the ventilation shafts. The voice acting is passable.\n\nThere is more open space now and this open space still feels like, well, the open dead space, with or without the monsters.\n\nThe battles are still as satisfying as ever, but they can get frustrating at times. The good old retreat-them-and-shoot-them formula doesn't always work here, because you WILL find yourself surrounded. The game can get pretty hard on the Zealot mode, but I hate the fact that they give you an option to change difficulty in mid game, what a cop out! Plus I don't like the option challenging my commitment and resolve to beating almost any game I play on the maximum difficulty\n\nThere are plenty of weapons, but my favorite still remains the good old plasma rifle. I mean come on, all that engineering and mining equipment is interesting and all but we still want to see some automatic fire.\n\nThe game plays great in 3D vision and there are no FPS spikes.\n\nThe environments are more varied. You can actually get plenty of solid glimpses of the pre-necromorph normal civilian life\n\nThe new monsters are really well implemented, but I couldn't help but feel that some of them were already used in Left4Dead. I guess at some point you will start running out of ideas and start recycling the old ones. Nevertheless, the AI stays strong.\n\nAs with the first game, the save stations are enough to give you the incentive to be cautious and not rush, die and re-load constantly.\n\nThe good old weapon and skill upgrades are still here.\n\nI should also point out the great pacing of the game. They really did a good job of making you semi-relaxed and then unleashing hell on you and vice versa. I think I should also mention something that is taken for granted. With the exception of save stations, this game is continuous. That is, you will never see a loading screen, and your screen will never go dark for a few seconds; This game is like a continuous narration of a nightmare and you are the protagonist with emotions and aspirations. Consider other games and think of how many loading screens you will go through that interrupt the game play and mar the immersion.\n\nWord of advice, count your shots and memorize how many shots it takes to kill a necromorph, there is a good chance you really didn't kill one.\n\nThe multiplayer is not bad.  If you play as humans, you will have a few minutes to complete an objective, and that gameplay does feel like a co-op experience. If you play as the necromorph, you will have to stall and prevent the humans from completing their objective by spawning in strategic areas and working as a team. It's fun, but I doubt many will play the multiplayer in a few months.\n\nPlay it for the awesome singleplayer and its highest punishing difficulty.","November 27, 2013","true","33.0"," 85 of 119 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","85","119","0","0"

Its not better or worse he's more of a vanilla flavor now instead of being just a mystery like the first game. One quick downside is that you'll need an Origin account. Yep, feel free to hate the game because you need to log in even if you don't actually need Origin on your PC, just an account. Now that's out of the way the people who aren't outraged into throwing bloody feces can read on.\n\nFor those that didn't play the first game, you have an optional video recap of the first game and its events that happened. When the game opens, the space station you're on board has already been taken over by alien necromorphs that use dead bodies to mutate them into a variety of creatures.  The game has always boasted strategic dismemberment, so you'll need to shoot an enemy in the legs where it will then crawl after you. Shoot its head and it will blindly swing at you. Its a nice dynamic that really boils down to your aim.\n\nSince the space station is being overrun with creatures, you'll see NPCs fighting for their lives in scripted sequences, but it doesn't break the flow of the game with straight up cut scenes. It feels like you'll always have movement or the game will always be moving forward. It adds to the immersion process. Even if you are not alone, you're the only person that can do anything. The game is beautiful with all of its horrific glory, lighting effects and sheer beauty of space. You get a scale and a scope with this game. You'll look over space apartments, see shuttles leaving and others crashing. You'll walk through a church, and a brightly lit, yet super creepy kindergarten school. It feels like the station is alive where the original Dead Space 1 felt very controlled circumstances, like nothing was happening without you being there in the room.\n\nIs it scary? The game has gone through great lengths to make this game legitimately scary and more tense than the first game. Its not just scary monsters chasing you oh how scary. Its being haunted by your dead girlfriend. The game also manages to put you in a lot of helpless moments such as being in a straight jacket with enemies around or hanging upside down and forced to murder enemies before they reach you (some might call it a turret section with a twist). There are some memorable scenes. Other than that, the game keeps a dark atmosphere with amazing lighting. You still get a flashlight that only works when you aim. Thankfully the developers have really done a lot to clean up the ragdoll problem that had the dead enemies get stuck in the player's feet for laughs.\n\nThe controls have improved from the first game, thankfully there are now hot buttons for health, reload and other minor tweaks that feel so much better. For those that haven't played, left stick controls movement, right stick or mouse controls the camera, you have 4 weapon slots to change in the D-pad, an aim button, shoot button, which is also the melee button when not aiming, telekinesis button to pull objects, stasis button to slow objects down while you run by, run button, health button and so on. There's even a stomp button for destroying boxes and when you think enemies are dead, but they haven't dropped any items, so you go over and stomp them for valuable prizes like health and ammo. Thankfully the game's map and inventory have been replaced, with easy to use 'follow the line on the floor' when you push a button and the inventory only appears when you're at a store. The line on the floor disappears, so its not a blunt cheat so much as a brief hint if you need it.\n\nDead Space 2 takes you through extra steps that Dead Space 1 didn't really touch on to teach and inform you extra ways to use your powers. Such as using telekinesis to pick up and throw items at enemies that seems to damage them more than your guns can.\n\nThe station has stores that allow you to sell your items, buy more weapons, ammo, health and suits to wear. Each suit now has a special buff, which feels good and it give you more choice and our hero Issac will have more style! Buffs like weapon X does more damage, more health when you use health packs, more air and so on. You can still find health and ammo in a lot of places. Dead Space 1 and 2 both reward you for looking around, but for the most part if it has a light, there's something in it.\n\nYou'll also get energy nodes that you go to upgrade benches and upgrade your weapons, suits, stasis powers and so on with simple to follow upgrade paths. One node per point on the upgrade path and it might take you 3 points to upgrade what you want. Its a nice system. At some point you'll earn the right to resort your nodes so if you've put everything into stasis and air, you won't be screwed in later parts of the game.\n\nThe original game was good, but this adds a lot more to the gameplay, such as now in zero gravity areas, you don't just leap from point A to point B in a straight line, now you can jet around.  You can also climb through air ducts in realistic third person fashion and there are also hacking mini games that boil down to, circle the left thumbstick until you find what you're looking for. These might not be ground breaking, but they feel like a good diversion from the norm.\n\nDead Space 2 offers a lot of new enemies and situations. New enemies that vomit at you, new raptor like humanoids that will flank you and call to each other before charging straight at you, new children, new exploding babies and much more. You'll find new bosses that offer more variety than the original game's bosses. All of the enemies are back from Dead Space 1, but this time the developers have gone through, reskinned old enemies and offered more variety in every creature. It won't just be the same mutated man in a labcoat, it will be a variety of people and genders. It feels good and fresh in what could have easily been just a same old rehash. Speaking of a rehash, while you're in space, you're no longer on a space ship, now you're on a space station that has a lot of different areas, slums, apartments, med labs, and so on. Its all about diversity here.\n\nThe game has improved little details such as the arm extension into walls. It just feels fresh while feeling very familiar. There is also tacked on multi-player that requires you to have an Origin account that features 4 players as engineers vs 4 players as enemies. So that's good I guess, but the single player experience is the real star here.\n\nFor anyone that truly wants the game it has been on sale for $5 pretty frequently. Give it some time. Otherwise, I'd say the game is worth $20 and I'm cheap.","August 7, 2014","true","14.9"," 31 of 37 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","31","37","0","0"

While not as atmospheric as the first, this game is still very fun and intriguing, and you will want to know even more about this universe that visceral has created. 7.5/10","June 8, 2013","true","9.6"," 25 of 30 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","25","30","0","0"

It takes all the aspects that were great in Dead Space and improved upon them without changing the game mechanics that worked well.\n\nIf you want a nice challenge to make it feel less action filled, play it on zealot difficulty until you can unlock "hardcore" mode.  However, if you are looking for a laid back playthrough, survivalist should feel right at home.\n\nIn this revival of the classic and critically acclaimed Dead Space, Isaac Clarke battles horrors and psychological barriers.  A nice improvement over the mundane, fetch-it systems engineer that we once knew. Isaac has more of a voice and you get a look into his mind as he traverses through the nightmarish space station.\n\nThe Dead Space universe has a warm place in my heart.  Visceral Games, without Electronic Arts' restrictions, are great developers who are extremely passionate about their intellectual property.  It is nice to know that the Dead Space series may be revisited in the future, and talks about Dead Space 4 is not quite dead.\n\nRating:  9.0 out of 10\n\nHighly recommended.","April 7, 2015","true","0.7"," 22 of 27 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","22","27","2","12"

Does however include active animations for the characters, along with a bit more expansion to the necromorphs. Compared to the first one, the first one is alot better as it does emphasize that panicking can make things harder when surviving. This Game is more shooter then survival as you can easily aquire strong equipment due to the dlcs being on it early, but even then soon as you get the pulse rifle or other equipment your just good with it can turn relative easy(especially with the new alt fire for pulse rilfe...upgrade that bad boy easy to clear some situations).(SPOILER SENTENCE) The game does get back at you though at then end of the chapter depending on how much time you deal with the ubermorphs and necros, lets say its a run through to the marker that you don't want to be low on if playing on harder game modes. Its straight forward, storyline is pretty good and the start is one that sets you on your guard for the rest of the game.This game still introducing something alot more fun and even throws in a badd ♥♥♥ moments which makes you feel like hots stuff, and small form of comedy if you get through the wall.","October 20, 2014","true","11.0"," 17 of 21 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","17","21","0","0"

Jumping right back into the action seat, Dead Space 2 picks up literally with the heart pounding, fast paced action of the original, leaving us to wonder, will Isaac be able to cheat death a second time?\n\nDead Space 2 looks as good if not slightly better than the original.

Dead Space 2 has a feature to allow new players to the franchise access to a video recap, complete with narration, of the events of the original Dead Space on the USG Ishimura.

Isaac Clarke needs to destroy the Marker (the seed of evil), therefore he has to explore a massive space station, work with various characters and kill a lot of Necromorphs. While the plot is similar, the storytelling technique has changed for the better, Isaac can now speak and the voice performances of him are excellent.\nAdding to the overall tension of Dead Space 2 is one of its central plot lines: Isaac seems to be insane this time around. This plays an important role in the story as delusions begin tormenting him early on including a terrifying ghost version of his dead lover Nicole.\nZero gravity mechanics have been overhauled and Isaac is now afforded a full six degrees of motion and able to fly in any direction with his thrusters. One other addition is the ability to hack certain circuit panels, an activity that initiates a quick mini-game.\nThe mutliplayer mode features a familiar experience system, slowly unlocking new goodies as players level up. Necromorphs acquire upgrades to their abilities, while humans can unlock new weapons and armor configurations.\nDead Space 2 does not stray far from its roots, but it still manages to provide one of the best action horror experiences available.

It's Western horror, which often has relied on attempts to startle the player and turn their stomach with disturbing images and gore.  However, I couldn't stop playing, due to the fact that your very squishy foes are very fun to blow apart with an array of unique weaponry and tactics.

I might like this one too... if I actually got to play the game as it was meant to be played. For some insane reason, in this steam version, EA puts all the pay-to-win items for free in the store! So have fun getting to the first store in Chapter 1 and having every weapon and armor suit for free. Now you might be saying "just ignore them". Well, i can with the guns, but i have no idea which suit im supposed to have... Plus, it just totally destorys imersion (critical to this game) and fun of collecting/upgrading throughout the game. Not only that, but apparently it also causes the drops to be different and makes the game overall easier.\n\nOnce I realized what EA had done, I started looking for ways to disable this pay-to-win crap, and in looking i lost desire to continue playing. What a drag. Maybe Ill come back to it. But I certainly cant recommend such nonsense.\n\nA simple toggle of you "do you want the pay-to-win... errr... dlc bonus items in your game?" would have fixed this.

I first played through the game back in 2011 just after it released.\nThe game scared the crap out of me! Seriously. It was the most horrifying game i had ever played.\nHowever the character development, dark atmosphere and gameplay left a very positive feeling to me so i wanted to revisit the game.\n\nFast forward to January 2016. 4 years after i first played through the game. Graphics still feel nice. Nothing special. It's not on par with the Witcher 2, Battlefield 3, Deus Ex: HR or Crysis 2 (Every single one of these games released in 2011) but it's still a good looking game.\nIt looks damn good for a dark horror game. The lightning and adventuring in the darkness is done perfectly. The armosphere is still there. The sound effects still sound so very good and the gameplay...Ahhh the gameplay is simply a masterpiece!\nHowever it doesn't feel like a horror game anymore. At no point was i scared in my second playthrough in 2016. Felt like an ordinary third-person shooter without a cover mechanism.\nIt gave me a few adrenaline rushes when the enemies were coming from different directions and were overwhelming but it didn't actually scare me.\nMaybe because i had already played through the game or maybe because im now 4 years older. Tho i'm sure that A LOT of people would still find this scary. After all some people think that F.E.A.R games are scary and i strongly disagree with them.\n\nThe game is great tho. The voice acting is very well done. The few characters in this game actually have CHARACTER and the game constantly keeps you in your seat wondering what's going to happen next.\nThe gameplay is wonderful. You can wield 4 guns at the same time. You can have a pistol, a plasma rifle (an assault rifle) a flamethrower and a line gun (basically a space shotgun) all at once. You can shoot the legs off your enemies to slow them down. They lose their legs but keep crawling towards you and are still quite deadly. The point is that you can dismember your enemies!\nThere are 10 different guns in Dead Space 2 and each gun has a primary and secondary fire option so when it comes to killing aliens there's a lot of variety.\nYou can also pick up pretty much everything from the ground and use that as a weapon. You can kill an alien, pick up its blown off arm and shoot it at another alien.\nYou can also freeze rushing aliens to give yourself more time running away, reloading or dealing with other threats.\nYou can also upgrade your weapons and suits (yeap, you can buy different armors aka space suits) to give you more damage, faster reload speed, more capacity or more health when it comes to armor.\n\nDead Space 2, while being a very scary game, is very fast paced to keep you on your toes at all times and that makes this singleplayer experience one of the best in 2011.\nBack in 2011 i beat the game using a keyboard and a mouse. Now in 2016 i beat the game using a 360 controller and i gotta say the gameplay is perfectly enjoyable with both of them so feel free to play the game however you want to.\nThere's also a new game+ mode and a hardcore mode which only allowes 3 saves and whenever you die it ports you back to the last save (That's right! No checkpoints!) but you won't get to try that before beating the game first.\n\nDead Space 2 is a masterpiece and totally worth its current full prize!\n\nGAME ON!","January 14","true","8.6"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Most of all I appreciated the new Zero Gravity controls, in which you had full freedom to move and levitate in open space, whereas in the first one you could only jump from one surface to another.\nOf course, new weapons and suits were also added, which was nice, though I ended up mostly sticking with the weapons I had gotten accustomed with in the first game... and I wore a suit that was a lot reminiscent of the first one's also. Old habits die hard, I guess.\n\nThe enemies were, too, a lot similar to the original Dead Space's, but some new ones made an appearance as well, most notably a big necromorph called The Tormentor, which chases you for a good part of the game.\n\nThe story is good,  set 3 years after the events of the original game and manages to bring the atmosphere to life in a very similar tone as the latter. The game, as a true sequel would demand, is also 3 chapters longer than its predecessor and, while at times it felt a bid dragged, does what it does very well.\n\nWhat maybe could be described as my only complaint would be the fact that it sacrificed the first's scary and tense atmosphere for more flashy effects and action sequences, filling it with plenty QTE-like battles, probably influenced from the trend created by modern action games, such as the God of War or Assassin's Creed series, which, in itself, isn't necessarily a bad thing, if it wasn't for the horror factor that suffered a bit from this.\n\nIn a few words the game became, as I wrote in the first sentence, "louder" than the previous one, as most sequels tend to be.\n\nHowever, that said, the game still remains a lot scary and is a worthy successor of the Dead Space name, needless to say that there is even a level in which you enter the "playground" of the first, the planet-cracker spaceship Ishimura and re-visit some areas you explored the first time around and see how it changed over the years.\n\nLast but not least, I remember one of the hardest and most stressing parts of the first game was fighting off a miniboss-like necromorph, called the Hunter, which had infinite regeneration and, as such, could not be killed by normal means and you had to run for your life, while fighting other necromorphs as well... as you might have guessed, this pricky son of a gun makes an appearance in the final levels of the second game as well, this time called the Ubermorph, lowering a lot your survival rate!\n\nSuch a pity that the third game doesn't exist on Steam and that, as such, this is my final review here for the franchise, but, for what it's worth, Dead Space 2 was really a blast and a good horror ride, recommended for all of you, fans of chills and thrills!","February 24","true","44.2"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","7","8","2","2"

Takes the first game > Adds a load of content to it > Continues the story from the last game > Adds in Multiplayer.\n\nIn-depth Review:\n\nIn the world of Third Person Survival Shooters, this game comes out on top for being both challenging and fun. However, much like the first game, I didn't find it to be all that scary like most people do. Sure, it had it's moments and my heart rate did occasionally jump up drastically in some situations, but overall I think the scare factor for this game, and the previous one is pretty low, but that's nothing I would take off points for.\n\nThe story line is pretty much what I expected (Oh noes, they made another marker and became obsessed with the crap because the alien signal told them to. Now Isaac has to go on another journey to destroy it. Sound Familiar?) but even with that said, they added in a few major plot twists and mysteries which made it about 100% more unique.\n\nRe-playability also seems to be better, since there are 2 new difficulty levels, one of which only lets you save 3 times throughout the playthrough, and on top of that resets everything you worked for in the last playthrough, such as weapon and suit upgrades.\n\nGraphics/Visuals haven't improved, but honestly, they didn't need to. I mean, I would have liked them to increase the texture quality on the characters and the various suits that Isaac wears, but It's no big deal.\n\nMultiplayer in this game is also very unique and I would totally play it more, but unfortunately it's quite dead, it's almost impossible to get a full game going unless you have 7 friends to play with.\n\n\n","June 28, 2014","true","13.6"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

The RPG elements mixed in with the TPS storytelling mesh perfectly with one another to bring an unforgettable sequel akin to its equally great predecessor. That being said, the two games are both good but in different ways: The first Dead Space was more of a creepy horror game with action being its sidekick, while Dead Space 2 is more of a sci-fi shooter with some creepy aspects to it; there was an inverse, but nothing was inherently lost from the overall gameplay. However, your own opinion may vary depending upon your susceptibility to being scared, and this game certainly does not disappoint in that department--The game puts you straight into the shocking, fast-paced, frightening action right from the beginning.\n\nDead Space 2 also polishes up a few facets from the last game such as a better zero-g flight system and controls, more weapons, and more enemies in order to bring a more expansive, smooth gameplay to the player. Of course, there are still a few funny glitches such as the physics and movements of the many cadavers scattered throughout each chapter; it is almost like gmod decided to visit space in a sense. Also, gameplay is very similar to the first game (as you should expect): smash and dismember everything in your path or be dismembered and eviscerated yourself. Simple survival rules to say the least by Darwinian Standards.\n\nI definitely recommend picking up this game if you liked the first Dead Space. I do not even have to go through the five stages of grief after finishing this game to come to the conclusion that Dead Space 2 easily deserves a 9/10. So keep your "eye out" for when it goes on sale in the Steam Store. The only thing I have a problem with is the fact that Dead Space 3 has yet to be released on Steam...so pick it up on console or get yourself an Origin Account in the meanwhile until that fateful day comes if you cannot wait after finishing Dead Space 2.","April 14, 2014","true","13.1"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","8","11","0","0"

After all, Improvements are the Main things you want to hear after you hear the Word-Sequel. So without Further ado, heres the Good and Bad, simplified..\n\nPros:+the Story is Short, for casual gamers this is Good News! (Approx 10-12 hours on Normal)\n+Simplified Mechanics means that Tutorials take less time! yay.\nGraphics feel smoother than DS1 and much more mellow colours/themes in levels.\n+The Battle isnt just on the sprawl, it also spans a unique conflict in Isaac's Mind, His Mental Health is Greatly affected from the events of the previous game (No Spoilers here) and any chance of "recovery" is......Absolutely Obliterated.\n+Plot (although short) is interesting and keeps you interested in the developments and futures for many of the characters.\n+So many Upgrades to Choose from (Suits, health, air, armour, ammo and the tough but rewarding "pearl" that is the Work-Bench.\n+So many Weapon Variations too! There are 11 Main guns in the Game but each have about 3 different variations for elemental effects or special features that belong with a special suit. Lots of work clearly done here.\n+So many New Enemies! yay, there are specific enemies for dark areas, zero-G, Open Halls and even Plastered on Walls! (Euurgh.)\n+Voice Acting is Slightly above average, giving Isaac a voice was a risky decision but EA pulled it off alright in the end i think.\n+The Atmosphere and Environments! of Course, many new areas are seen in the Story that were only mentioned in the first game. Obviosly the biggest one being a massive Church of Unitology! this really gives a deep insight into the Culture of the Cult members and even some instances of segregation because of it! This kind of detail is rare for a game, especially for a Horror!\n+Speaking of Environments, you can now fly/jet around in space in some parts. the controls took me a while to learn however.\n+While this might not be a true down to the roots-horror game, its definietely a Gory Ride. Once again Dead Space lives up to its R18 Rating. One Scene Worth Mentioning is the MANUAL Laser eye surgery segment...DONT Screw up!, 'Nuff Said\n+Im a Sucker for Hard Difficulties in Horror games, and luckily Dead Space 2 didnt dissappoint: The Impossible Mode from Dead Space 1 has grown into a real man now! Hard-core Gamers can now experience the (Wisely named) Hard-Core mode! The Main feature of this mode is that you now only have 3 Saves to use throughout th whole story, this combined with regular things like OP enemies, low Health and Little to NO Supplies make it a very challenging experience, almost...a Horror Game.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=577904853\nCons:-Its Too Bloody Short! its a breeze on easy and normal. only on hard or above do you really see the kind of experience it intended! Gathering Supplies Really makes the Game a lot more challenging and takes away from the Constant action\n-Cutscenes are very Linear and suddenly turn int QTE's when you least expect! (Timing is everything!)\n-Some Lag/Frame Rate drops that i experienced. (around 2 per playthrough, not too bad)\n-Theres hardly any Boss Battles in the game! and when there is, they are nowhere close to the unique battles that DS1 had!\n-Because its a very short game, the time to understand Isaac's "persona" and motivations is drastically reduced. Action>"Mind Battle" with Nicole>Action>Plot>Cutscene>Boss>Action>Repeat. Thats basically a cycle of events really.\n-An Abundance of Ammo is great! but DS2 has the opposite.. (in the harder modes this is changed obviously.) This doesnt help the Horror Name of DS2 and really changes it into an Action-Packed one instead. Which is True! For Some people this is good, for others its bad. But the Atmosphere overall doesnt Compare with the Confines of the Ishimura or Tight Spaces in Zero-G from the First Game. Instead, it seems like a Rushed Plot which has good directions for the story but is cut short after the Final Boss (Great Boss though) and isnt explained Clearly. Which is exactly what the Third game is for, wow!! Bloody EA...\n\nFinal Thoughts:I think this game makes many improvments in common areas, but NOT Atmosphere and the Mysteriousness and Scariness that it held deep inside the Ishimura! Story is standard really, which sets itself up for a third game very well. Not as much Backstory as the First game. Which is strange because there is a 3 Year Gap inbetween 1 and 2! BUT Since im such a fan, here is the Order of the DS Series! (To Read, Play and watch!):\nMartyr (Book)\nDead Space (Graphic Novel)\nDownfall (Animated Film)\nExtraction (Wii Game)\nFirst Game\nSalvage (Graphic Novel)\nAftermath (Graphic Novel)\nDead Space (Mobile Game)\nIgnition (Xbox Minigame)\nSecond Game\nThird/Final Game + the DLC\nHope that was Helpful.\nAnyway I rate this game a 7.5/10!\nAn interesting sequel with a heavy Focus on Isaac's Mind and Unitology! as well as many minor improvements..\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=582353606\nHope you liked this Review for the last Dead Space game on steam! ;( Leave a Comment with any questions below, as usual :D\n\n-Kyle","April 21","true","41.2"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","10","15","0","2"

There isn't anything really new gameplay wise, which isn't a bad thing. Basically suit and weapon upgrades, moving from point A to point B, and shooting anything that pops out at you.\n\nThe story events take place several years later after the original game and makes a lot of references back to that story so if you haven't played the first one, you're going to be missing out on what happened before.\n\nThe line cutter was my favorite weapon in the first game and it still ended up being my favorite in this one, although it was pretty satisfying to stick an enemy to the wall with a javelin.\n\nAnother great third-person, horror, sci-fi, action shooter.","January 5","true","13.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/febel/recommended/47780/","febel","Febel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/febel/","571 products in account","Short version: An improvement on the original in almost every way, tight and adrenaline fueled combat, one of the only video game gun upgrade systems that seems both justified and interesting and generally pretty fun to play. Just don't expect to be scared or to give a single ♥♥♥♥ about any of the characters. 8/10. If you can get it on sale for $10 or less I'd say it's a must buy.\n\nI bought this on sale for $5 and generally speaking I'd say I would've payed more. The gameplay is loads of fun and combat can be very, very hectic, in a good way. The zero gravity sections from the first game have been massively improved and are now actually fun to do and what I would generously call "puzzles" are few and far between which is good in a game like this. The graphics are very good and most of the settings you play through look gorgeous. On a related note the Dead Space series' one innovation, the completely menu diagetic interface, returns and is as neat a novelty as ever. There are quite a few action setpieces that, while maybe not memorable, are certainly very impressive and a blast to play through, especially since many of them will take a new player completely by surprise. The only downside to the game is it's pretentions to scaryness. The original Dead Space could almost manage to be scary with its constant dark hallways and feelings of isolation but Dead Space 2 just seems to be trying far, far too hard. The soundtrack loses it's damn mind everytime an enemy spawns, ruining any kind of surprise, and refuses to die down until the very last enemy dies, instantly alerting the player to the fact that there's nothing more to worry about. The game relies almost entirely on jump scares, the vast majority of which will be spotted long beforehand by even the most remotely savvy of players and the few that aren't at all telegraphed will probably have more players laughing than jumping (An alarm clock jumpscare, really?). The game also tries desperately to up the ante of the first game's monsters with, get this, child enemies and even BABY enemies both of which come across as more humerous than terrifying. The first 3-4 hours of gameplay also has an almost pathological tendency to introduce characters only to see them murdered horibbly within a matter of minutes (or in several cases, seconds) which means that most players will never start to care about the actually important characters because they'll be assuming a quick-but-painful death in their near future. So while the game is great fun and certainly worth it's price, don't expect a truly scary experience unless you're a twitchy coward. Oh and there's multiplayer too but I never tried it because honestly who gives a ♥♥♥♥.\n\n-Also, it's important to note that this steam release apparently comes with all the various weapon and armor packs free of charge, all of which can be purchased in-game at the very first store you come across at an unbelievable price of 0 dollars. I recommend against using any of them on your first playthrough because they break game balance over their knee and ruin what little tension the game managed.","September 27, 2013","true","17.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","2"

Coming form Dead space 1 to this the stroy flows through really nicely. Its a great story and like number 1 you find a lot of backstory about whats happening throughout.\n\nThe horror. Well In the begining its fantastic. A few nicely put jump scare moments and some really scary mecromorhps get your heart going and you find yourself scouring and survivng the best you can. As a con however near the end the horror looses its edge as it become more action non stop style. But its the end and its expected. The anticipation for the end of the story covers it nicely however and you dont really miss the horror at the end.\n\nThe comabt mechanics are spot on. All i can recommend is try using different weapons as much as possible. A lot of people say you will only use the pulse rifle and plasma cutter. But if you buy the other weapons you can have much more fun & they are more effective. Such as the javelin gun (A personal favorite).\n\nOverall Its a 9.5/10 for me.\n\nHighly Recommened.","February 21, 2014","true","15.9"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

Hell yes.\nLet me start by saying this is one of the most beautiful games I have ever played. I could spend a half hour just looking out the windows onto the city. But Dead Space 2 can take you from awe to terror in just a few seconds. The necromorphs are grotesquely designed, and the action is perfectly choreographed. Sure, there are plenty of jump out of the closet scares, but I would NOT call this a survival horror game, simply because you're a walking gun cabinet. Necromorphs end up falling apart after a few credits are spent on upgrades. But for the most part, watching your enemies being torn to shreds compensates for those false claims. The hardest thing for me is to identify any faults. If I had to complain about anything, it would be the multiplayer. Although it looks good on paper, I found it to be very dry and uninteresting, as if Visceral missed a few key elements in designing it.","December 26, 2015","true","7.5"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","75","6","8","5","0"

Kompleks Cerita dimulai dari Dead Space pertama yang sukses mendongkrak pamor dari game ini .  Dead Space 2 menceritakan 3 tahun setelah tragedi Dead Space yang pertama.  Isaac Clarke  (tokoh utama) berhasil lolos dari insiden USG Ishimura yang mana dia bertahan dan melawan makhluk alien yang bernama Nechromorphs.\n\nIsaac Clarke di Dead Space 2 ini memang menjadi tumpuan musibah . Bayangkan, baru saja game ini di mulai, kita akan di suguhkan cuplikan adegan mengerikan dari kebrutalan Necromorphs. Tidak cukup disitu saja, di pembukaan game ini kita pun harus survive dari kejaran Necromorphs dalam keadaan tangan terikat. Belum lagi game ini disuguhkan dengan Kualitas grafik , detail karakter dan lingkungan , atmosfer , dan soundtrack yang membuat anda lebih baik diam di tempat daripada melanjut kan misi >_<\n\nNecromorphs berbeda dengan zombie menurut saya, biasanya di game game yang lain anda cukup menembak kepala saja. Berbeda dengan Necromorphs, menembak kepala saja tidak cukup, anda harus memotong dan menghancurkan tubuh dari Necromorphs itu sendiri XD .\n\nNecromorphs di Dead Space 2 ini juga bervariasi, ada yang lambat dan memiliki damage besar, ada yang memiliki kecepatan yang bahkan membuat anda kewalahan mengahadapi nya, ada yang berbentuk mekanisme seperti bom dan ranjau, dan  ada yang mampu menembak kan zat asam.\n\nDi Dead Space 2 ini anda masih bisa membeli beberapa ammo, armor, health pack dan  senjata dalam melanjutkan petualangan selanjutnya. Anda cukup mengumpulkan coin dari hasil membunuh Necromorphs atau mendapatkannya dari menjelajah ruangan. Tidak cukup sampai disitu, Dead Space 2 juga ada sistem Upgrade, seperti Upgrade senjata, health dan lain lain. Anda cukup mengumpulkan power node yang berada random di ruangan atau membeli di Shop .\n\nArmor di game ini layak nya seperti di game RPG, karena setiap armor memiliki efek dan fungsi masing masing. Ada yang menambahkan efek ke Health, ke Weapon atau ke Armor itu sendiri.\nWeapon di Dead Space 2 ini pun juga bermacam ragam, ada Plasma Cutter, Heavy Duty Detonator, Agility Rivet Gun, Forged Line Gun dan masih banyak lagi.\nOh iya, dalam menggunakan Weapon ini juga ada beberapa mode, mode normal hanya menembakkan seperti biasa, dan mode Space. Ketika anda menggunakan weapon, cukup tekan tombol Space, dan mode dari weapon akan berubah dengan sendiri nya, seperti contoh Forged Line Gun dalam mode normal akan menembakkan listrik , dan ketika mode Space, akan menembak kan ranjau listrik yang akan meledak dalam beberapa detik.\n\nUntung nya di game ini di lengkapi dengan Locator yang dapat menunjukkan posisi Save , Bench (Upgrade), Shop dan Objektif selanjutnya . |Setiap arah dari Locator ini dibedakan dari beberapa  warna  seperti warna biru menunjukkan Objective, kuning menunjukkan Shop, Ungu menunjukan posisi Bench, warna hijau menunjukkan posisi Save Station\nPercayalah , Fitur ini amat sangat membantu kita dalam menamatkan petualangan Isaac Clark.\n\nSelain itu masih ada fitur yang menjadi tambahan dalam game ini. Yakni Gadget Kinesis. Fungsi dari fitur ini adalah dapat mengangkat benda benda, tubuh  dan objek lain nya ke udara, juga dapat melemparkan ke arah yang kita mau. Nah, inilah yang menjadi Weapon cadangan. Jika anda kekurangan Ammo, anda tidak perlu cemas. Cukup cari berbagai benda, seperti besi tajam dan angkat menggunakan Gadget Kinesis dan lemparkan ke Necromorphs.\nJuga ada mode modul Statis. Fungsinya apa? Fungsi mode ini dapat memperlambat gerak suatu objek. Misal pintu Lift, cukup anda tembakkan , dan otomatis Pintu Lift tadi menjadi lambat pergerakanya. Mode ini juga berguna sekali dalam misi, misal anda juga kekurangan Ammo, cukup anda tembakkan modul statis ke objek itu, maka Necromorphs akan bergerak lambat. Disinilah action Punch dan Injakan dapat membunuh Necromorphs.\nPuzzle juga ada di game ini, gunakan mode Gadget Kinesis dan modul Statis agar mempermudah anda menyelesaikan puzzle tersebut.\n\nVisual efek yang menjijikan, Soundtrack yang membuat ngilu kaki untuk melangkah, mekanisme gameplay yang cepat, Panorama Luar Angkasa dan Futuristik yang menjadi nilai tambah game ini, Rentetan Story yang ciamik. Game ini sangat WORTH untuk dimainkan bagi anda pecinta horror game yang ingin memiliki pengalaman berbeda.\n\nNilai dari saya 9/10\nInfo :  Pertengahan game sempat membuat membuat saya Pusing dan Mual. wkwkwkwkwk XD","March 25, 2015","true","38.7"," 14 of 24 people (58%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","58","14","24","6","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/raiseohitsu/recommended/47780/","raiseohitsu","Raiseo Hitsu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/raiseohitsu/","641 products in account","Dead Space 2 is a great survival horror experience that I feel like I should recommend to my gamer friends, but why do I say so?\n\nFirst of all, it's a survival horror, which is quite a rare genre these days, but that doesn't influence my recommendation, I am merely stating this fact for you to keep in mind if you were searching something like this.\n\nI finished the game in roughly 14 hours or so, with a good pace, exploring everything and playing at the survivalist difficulty, which is one grade higher than normal, as I saw in the forums, it is the best difficulty for someone wanting a challenge, instead of the highest which is zealot and is recommended for new game+.\n\nThe challenge was good, I was tense most of the time, never mind the jump scares, the ammo was pretty scarce and the enemies needed only two or three hits to take you down, and all this considering careful ammo and inventory management.\nI did end up with a surplus of health kits that I saved in my safe and sold all the stasis packs, but the ammo, I had to buy some of those.\nThe gameplay is smoother from the first Dead Space, the character controls well and behaves like he should, which means you're not agile but you're not clunky either, it is a fine balance, although sometimes I wish I could roll out of the way I admit (which is not possible for the record).\nThe horror part and the environment were pretty well done, I never did scream or anything, it wasn't that terrifying, but I was tense most of the time and the occasional "F*ck" did come out of my mouth when confronted with jump scares or close encounters with numerous enemies. Which reminds me, most of the time I was collected and my aim was good, but the game did drive me in some corners where I panicked, which is definitely a plus in this genre.\nThe only reasons I would not recommend this game are mainly two design flaws :\n1.) No more than two bodies stay in the room, at the third body, the latest despawns, but what does this mean? It means that you need to stomp or otherwise damage enemies on the floor to get your drop (ammo, health, credits) and when the enemy despawns, so does the loot. Annoying to say the least.\n2.) Death is mostly harmless with no repercussions to the player, hell it is even advantageous at some points. When you die, you get back at the checkpoint, so if you had full health at a check point and, for example, fell into a stupid trap that reduced your health to red, you can just die and retry again with full health again and no other penalty (Of course this doesn't apply to hard core mode, a mode you unlock when you finish the game that allows only 3 saves and forces you to reload when you die).\nLastly I would like to talk about about the story in a short paragraph. The story continues from the first Dead Space of course, which I recommend to play too, but don't feel compelled to, everything is explained rather well I think. It's a good story, it has it's own charms, maybe a plot hole? Not sure. The good thing is I was genuinely surprised, not once but twice! The twist and turns were well done, it's not like I was looking forward to it, but it's definitely a plus when it's not reduced to a clichè and I didn't know what to expect.\n\nI think I covered everything, the graphics were good, the music almost non-existant, the multiplayer was pretty fun and original, but anyways it's a pretty cool survival horror, those who like the genre should definitely play it, besides, you'll probably get it for spare change like me during sales, I think I paid 2 euros or something, definitely worth it.","August 8, 2014","true","15.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The game looks very good & this time depth was given to the lead character Issac, which was a ballsy move considering he never spoke in the first game and we seen his face once, but in the end it payed off remarkably well. Even more terrifying than the first game and a welcome introduction of more horrifying creatures, the game had me tempted to turn down the difficulty just to calm the nerves.\nMultiplayer is very bad and I would nearly prefer if it wasn't there at all, it can be exscused because its single-player, which its made for, it so excellent.\nThere was something in the original that makes me prefer it but this is an amazing follow-up to an amazing game.\n8/10","May 29, 2014","true","20.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

He must kick every Necromorph's teeth out to find a way out, while also getting hunted by his dead, but hot ex-girlfriend. While fighting the Necromorhps and his ex-girlfriend, he meets Ellie, also a hot lady friend.

From claustrophobic corridors to huge warehouses filled with alot of creates that block your view. You don't know, there can be a Necromorph on every damn corner.\n\nThe gameplay is where this game shines. Each Necromorph has got it's weaknesses, you can even remove the limbs from them and shoot back at them. There are mini-games, zero gravity parts, great puzzles and like 50 ways in which Issac can die. The game offers great customize abillity, you can choose weapons that best fit your play style and then upgrade them. This game has atleast 8 hours of gameplay and a huge replay abillity, as it's impossible to upgrade everything in a single playthrough and there is also difficulty settings. The controls on PC are perfect.\n\nThe only dissapointing part is the multiplayer. It falls flat and doesn't offer anything new.

This was one of the biggest downfalls of the original. Good job.\n- Isaac actually talks in DS2 so you get a sense of his personality instead of playing a mute character. Good job.\n- Removed the overly obnoxious heavy breathing of the no-oxygen areas, and cleaned up the zero-gravity areas to be more fun and easier to control. Good job.\n\nOverall though, the first DS offered a stronger atmosphere and sense of helplessness than DS2, which surprised me a bit. Also the way the chapters are done in DS2 didn't seem to make much sense or have a rhyme or reason. For example, you could just crawl out of a vent (with nothing major happening to advance the story) and you just randomly entered a new champter. How does crawling out of a vent trigger a new chapter? It wasn't really a big deal and didn't effect the game, but it made the game feel like it was lacking direction.\n\nI felt like DS2 suffered greatly from poor character development. DS1 actually had decent character development and I had a pretty good sense of their personalities. DS2 took a step back from that.\n\nThe gameplay is nearly identical to the first one with the addition of a few new items you can use kinesis on for combat. I was hoping for some really cool boss battles, but I was disappointed once again (I feel like EA could be so creative with these monsters that they could make some insanely cool boss fights. How did this not happen?).\n\nIn some ways DS2 was better than DS1, but in other ways it took a step back. While the game is somewhat fun and I recommend it, I don't think it is the strongest franchise. DS2 takes about 12-15 hours to complete.\n\n7.5/10\n\nPlease upvote this review if you found it useful :)","June 7, 2014","true","13.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

It's a really great story that mixes strange religious cultism with horror, and leaves enough of the backround ambiguous to make it mysterious. The game also runs silky smooth on PC, and is a far better port than the original was. The link in with EA has been HIGHLY exaggerated also. Literally all you have to do is sign into an EA account, which many people probably have if they own a console, or have ever used Origin. It's really not as big a deal as everyone says.\n\nThe two major flaws however are as follows:\n\n1) You can only install this game a certain number of times so be carfeful not to uninstall unless you're finished with the game. It wasn't a huge problem for me as I got it on sale and only planned to do a quick run through, but for people who like to, you know, KEEP WHAT THEY FREAKING PAID FOR, or are just struggling with HDD space it may be a problem.\n\n2) The second flaw is kind of mind boggling. They must have included all the DLC for free with the game, because when you hit the very first store in the game you get access to all of the weapons and armour in the game straight away. Again this wasn't a big deal for me as I had already played this game on console and this basically gave me a free NG+ to run through the campaign, but I can see this seriously ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ some people off, especially new players.\n\nAll in all the game is great, and if you have no problem with the gripes i've mentioned then you may as well get it. However maybe if you've never played it before, buy it from origin as the DLC may not be included there, and you might get the full normal experience.\n\nGame - 9/10\nThis Version  - 7/10","May 26, 2014","true","2.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sushibar82/recommended/47780/","sushibar82"," sushibar82©","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sushibar82/","83 products in account","Dear Dead Space™ 2 review reader,\n\n\nThe Dead Space™ 2  game will be forever imbedded into my brain. No regrets buying it with the combo game pack (along with Dead Space™ ) FOR PC.\n\nI had the intention of playing it with the upgraded plasma cutter from Dead Space™ 1, however, am still clueless if DS2 managed to detect and include that information into the in-game store. Nevertheless, I started the game in anticipation with the memories of my experience with DS1; on Zealot mode. No less. No necromorph is going to come up and shake my hand in any difficulty, so what the heck, right?\n\nAs a graphic art enthusiast, the fluent user interface of the menu/ingame, colour scheme, stunning artwork on buildings and scenery, character a.i. and attention to detail (especially object animation and interaction) was the cream of the crop for me. From the hours spent on developing the game, you'd  know  that they loved creating it as much as you will love playing it.\n\nAs usual, the game starts off with an action-packed bounded sequence which really gets the blood flowing. If you had had a break from DS1 after a while... this will just jolt you back into "reality". Absolutely love the way developers give you a moment of silence now and then with the chills going down your spine while you raid and explore the beautiful Titan Station. Where there are necromorphs... you're definitely to be on the edge of the seat the whole time... forgetting whether you have  collected that stasis pack at the corner or checked that inconspicious pile of janitorial equipment at the medical deck of the  USG Ishimura .\n\nThe storyline is particularly intriguing and at times, marvelling with unexpected twists.This game is action-packed (sometimes crazy overly), horrifying and gruelling at times. It ends in the most  cheapest bossfight imaginable... but absolutely DOABLE . Remember, in any Dead Space game, never... ever.... give up..\n\nSo without further ado\n\n• What I totally dig:\n\n- The Graphics (Character, Suits, Scenery, Buildings, etc)\n- The Challenges (Necromorphs, Puzzles, Quick-time Events)\n- The Gear and Guns (Exsisting Guns and Suits in-game as well as the Extra Content Gear instore)\n- The Unexpected Surprises (Diamond Semiconductors, Jump attacks)\n- Extended Breadcrumb Locator menu (Loved it, includes nearest Save Station, Bench & Store)\n- The Experience (In-game sound, atmosphere, Zero-G baby!)\n\n• What I did not quite get:\n\n- The most obvious glitch in-game which happens for me, was that when you press the Tab Key while holding the Aim button (right mouse button), Isaac will be in a constant state of aiming even though you press everything else including shoot. This brings other interactive issues, which you can't do while aiming. Do Not Save the game in this state.The only way, I found out to undo this glitch, is to restart DS2 application and reload a previous save game.\nThe glitch also happens at the medical deck where a triggered cutscene happens. So if you were aiming, again.. restart DS2 Application and load last saved game.\nThis glitch also happens in DS1.\n\n- The last boss battle,  was cheap. Many people had suggested to use the Contact beam or Detonator for "easy"  boss defeat, but then again, why have all those other awesome guns? Experiencing it in Zealot mode, it was frustrating... 25 tries, or more. but I was resolute in getting the job done with my souped up Javelin, Line gun and Pulse Rifle for the "other" challenge. It was still a success, just that because of timing or luck... probably both. Would have preferred a better boss fight.\n\n• Personal Tips while Playing Dead Space™ 2:\n\n-   Always be inquisitive.  This can trigger special cutscenes or find yourself that item that gives you the extra edge.\n-   Keep calm.  Very often, you'd feel yourself freeze up from the fright. Remember, Isaac is equiped with a stasis module. So, if things get too intense, mesh that C key and dodge the hell out of there!\n-   "Run, Isaac, Run!"  Keep moving! Avoid any proximity from necromorphs or hazards. A hit caused by a necromorph can slow you down intensively and waste those precious seconds from regaining control of the character. This in turn will cause swarming. In Zealot mode, first few times being hit will be OHKs (One Hit Kills).\n-   Gun Hard-on.  The weapons in the game are amazing and it is always a shame to not try out any of them, if not all of them. Let go and try to have some quality time with the others. It will be worth the high.\n-   Watercooler discussion.  Take a break once in a while. The game gets extremely addictive at some points and frustrating at other points. Having fresh sessions per chapter helps and makes it enjoyable rather than repetitive.\n\n\nHope this review has been helpful. Have a great time playing Dead Space™ 2 and Good Luck!\n\nDS2 Gamer,\nsushibar82©\nZealot Mode\nMarch 2014","March 2, 2014","true","51.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","2"

The only downside of this game is, it has this stupid security restriction which allows you to play this game 5 times after windows install. In short, it has limit & if you try to play it after 5th times installed Windows it won't let you play it & you will need to contact EA support to fix it.

A timeless experience that will have you staring wideeyed and open mouthed. It may be the first time you curse at the necromorphs on the screen along with Isaac as you fight your way through 15 chapters.\n\nWhat's changed since Dead Space 1?\nBetter controls.\nMore details graphics.\nMore weapons, and improvements on current ones.\nA boatload of amazing cutscenes you won't want to miss.\nA very flushed out story that explains more about the Marker, Earthgov, and the Unitologists.\nThe only complaint, if it's even a complaint, is I wasn't as afraid. But this is the second game, I know where to look and what to expect. If you're looking for fear, you're going to get excitement and thrill. Perhaps this is a fear I'm accustomed to, I don't know. It didn't hinder my experience, but I did walk in having some expectation of fear, but I was given the best roller coaster, toddler stomping, baby blasting, necromorph head punching time of my life.","May 8","true","9.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

There are a couple of differences in the gameplay. Where in the original, you were wandering around a spaceship and could "revisit" certain areas by using the map, so if you needed ammo, you pulled up the map and found the nearest store (or bench or whatever you needed) In the sequel you just head on forward to the next save point in the style of a more traditional arcade shooter, so the game does lose something there.\n\nWhat the game does really well is to make you feel like a badass with a gun, fighting, shooting and chopping off limbs of various aliens is very satisfying indeed, sadly the progression of the game itself lets the whole thing down. You basically head from one point to the next only to find out that you need to fix/repair/switch on something... and when you have done that, you head off to the next thing that will need to be fixed/repaired/switched on before you can continue on your quest.\n\nAt around 12-15 hours, the game surprisingly starts to wear out it's welcome at around the 10 hour mark, as it begins to feel like the story is stretched out unnecessarily to make the game just that little bit longer. Just when you think you are done, you have to find yet another switch, or head outside and switch more things on. Luckily, the shooting mechanics are great as are the graphics and sound, so that helps make the experience much more enjoyable.\n\nSo like I said in the first line, if you enjoyed Dead Space, there is no reason you won't like more of the same.

I feel the game handles even better than the first one, and I didn't have any issues in DS1. The game doesn't add a lot of new elements, but why change things when the first one was so good?

The game follows protagonist Isaac Clarke's fight against a new Necromorph outbreak on the Sprawl, a space station above Saturn's largest moon, Titan.\n\nThe game incorporates many aspects of the original Dead Space game that made it such a classic, as a result some may consider the game Dead Space 1.5 rather than Dead Space 2. However, this is not a bad thing. The original game was great and as such, Dead Space 2 fills the large shoes of its predecessor whole and completely. As for the plot, I found it engaging which allowed me to connect with Isaac Clarke and his perilous quest. The gameplay was a smooth and enjoyable experience. In addition, Dead Space 2 was successful in creating a world that left you feeling alone and just one step behind the atrocities of the Necromorph outbreak. The subtle rumblings of a necromorph above you or the eerier silence when entering a new room provided just enough tension to make you jump out your seat when a necromorph jumps out at you.\n\nIf you thoroughly enjoyed the first Dead Space, Dead Space 2 will not disappoint.\n","March 23, 2014","true","13.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I didn't like it as much as I hoped that I would, BUT this is not because the game is low quality. In fact, the game is very well made. The reason that I was unhappy is that DS2 really veers away from horror to focus on action, and this was the exact opposite of the direction that I was hoping for. I had hoped to see an even tenser, sharper-edged survival horror than the original.\n\nThe second thing I want to say is that DS2 is really a very good action game. It has meaty weapons and interesting enemies set in diverse locations. The atmosphere is immersive, but lacking in tension. There is a fairly interesting backstory to the game, so exploring is definitely worth your time. That being said, this is not a horror game anymore. It is more like a "blast disturbing baddies with force guns" game. This is not necessarily a bad thing, just be aware of it. There are unsettling sections in the game, but I never felt frightened, just marginally unnerved.\n\nThis brings me to what I consider the most underused idea in the game: Isaac's dementia and hallucinations. Without going into spoilers, I found this to be a fascinating idea and was really excited about it in the beginning. Unfortunately, the idea rapidly devolves into just a repetitive series of similar hallucinations. It felt lazy. To me, it seemed like this mechanic could have been used to totally undermine Isaac's (and the player's) sense of reality. The hallucinations could have gone so much deeper, but it turned out pretty superficial, except for...\n\nMILD SPOILER ALERT WEEEeeeeWOOooooo MILD SPOILER ALERT\n\n\n... one particular scene, near the end of the game, where "Nicole" is sitting at arm's length from Isaac, and she asks him to touch her. He replies, "I don't think that's a good idea". In my humble opinion, this is one of the great scenes in games. It's simple, subtle, deeply emotional, yet horrifying. It hints at the seduction of madness at the same time as really telling us something about Isaac's personality and regrets. There are a few moments like this in DS2, and I consider them the best parts of the game.\n\nEND SPOILER WOOOoooooWEEEeeeee END SPOILER\n\nBasically, I see DS2 as kind of a missed oppurtunity, BUT it is definitely worth playing and you may very well love it. I mainly was disappointed because of my own expectations. This is a very solid action-horror, with a lot of spectacle and a number of thrills, just expect it to be heavy on the "Mad Max with Zombies in Space" and light on "A Tale of Two Sisters".\nI give it an 8.5/10 and a slightly cautious recommendation.","August 17, 2015","true","12.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This was, is, and always will be a favourite of mine, not too puzzling, dificulty scales well, still quite spooky, and smoth combat that is rarely interupted, but makes great use of hitboxes. Ragdoll physics and gib physics cobine almost seamlessly, along with excellent responsiveness to one's intended target. AKA you shoot leg, leg gets cut off where you shot it and ragdolls instantly. This game may also have inspired the, dare i mention it, death fetish tomb raider, better known as tomb raider 2013 however. Language, though not censored, is nowhere near oppressive and is taken in great moderation without sparing the story of emotion. gore, well, i mean if you're playing a zombie horror game but not wanting to see any gore you must be doing it wrong. on the topic of zombie horror, however, DS2 manages to capture the classic feeling of fear that comes with the collapse of society due to an outbreak, but also manages to make the zombies themselves terrifying and wastes no time plunging the player into a high-octane hook showcasing some of the creatures while instilling the initial fear into the player. Tutorial is simple and unobtrusive, albeit drawn out just a bit long (if you consider the first store the end of the tutorial) but does it's job better than most, if not all AAA titles these days, teaching the player how to use the more tactical and less practical skills to ensure that they can learn how to combine them with gunplay and running for your life for an effective strategy later in the game.\noverall, 8.75/10\nPC port needs a little bit of bug fixing after all these years and the multiplayer felt like an ever so slightly poorly executed version of L4D2, at least on the 360.\n-EDIT-\nthe minimum system requirements are way above what you will need to play, i managed a solid 40 FPS average on a 1.7 ghz processor, far less than their suggested 2.8","April 20, 2015","true","12.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The game follows protagonist Isaac Clarke's fight against a new Necromorph outbreak on the Sprawl, a space station above Saturn's largest moon, Titan.\n\nThe game incorporates many aspects of the original Dead Space game that made it such a classic, as a result some may consider the game Dead Space 1.5 rather than Dead Space 2. However, this is not a bad thing. The original game was great and as such, Dead Space 2 fills the large shoes of its predecessor whole and completely. As for the plot, I found it engaging which allowed me to connect with Isaac Clarke and his perilous quest. The gameplay was a smooth and enjoyable experience. In addition, Dead Space 2 was successful in creating a world that left you feeling alone and just one step behind the atrocities of the Necromorph outbreak. The subtle rumblings of a necromorph above you or the eerier silence when entering a new room provided just enough tension to make you jump out your seat when a necromorph jumps out at you.\n\nIf you thoroughly enjoyed the first Dead Space, Dead Space 2 will not disappoint.\n","March 23, 2014","true","13.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You will feel more like you are stumbling through a bunch of set pieces instead of navigating your way through a ship to achieve a task.\n\nOne aspect you may find jarring is that Issac now has a voice.

Clarke makes his escape while having hallucinations but is also guided by a stranger. This is where the story really kicks off. Because I'm going to avoid giving away any spoilers, I'm just going to say that the person you hallucinate throughout the game is Nicole, Isaac's former love interest from the first game.\n\nThe brilliance of the horror elements in this game is that it isn't a jump scare type of game. It's genuinely terrifying because of the extent of damage done to this space station due to a breakout in the disease that transforms the people into these abominations of creatures. The most memorable part is, arguably, when you're in a nursery and you see a woman, still alive, trying to cradle her baby, who has visibly transformed. Well, the baby has a yellow, soft belly and if you've played the first game, you'll remember that the yellow areas are weak points prone to explode. You can probably guess what happens to the woman.\n\nThe soundtrack is nice but the game really shines when there isn't any music at all. Just the vast void of sound is so profound and the slightest creak will catch you off guard. The sound mixing in this game is done expertly. The graphics are stellar. I mean, I can tell it came out in 2011, but the lighting is so great and the textures on the walls and characters are generally fantastic. All around splendid job on graphics. The level design is done well enough where each chapter has a varied design. I especially loved the zero gravity flying around in space. The vastness of it, and being able to see Saturn in the distance (I'm pretty sure it's Saturn) is just so unique.\n\nAnyway, I feel like I've said enough. Really, fantastic game. Highly recommend.\n\n9.3/10","January 30","true","10.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The atmosphere and environment art was stellar, filled with detail, dynamic lighting and smoke effects. It's not too scary or predictable, though there are some jump scares.  Most of the tension comes from the spooky music, the way the enemies move, and how danger suddenly spawns or flanks you. There's also some great gore scenes. The combat was very satisfying, and it was unique to focus on dismembering limbs and stomping on stuff instead of doign flat contact damage.  Overall, it is a very well put together game.\n\nThe parts I didn't like were that enemies pop up unrealistically close to you, and is often what's scary - that something loud and dangerous is suddenly right next to you.  The weapon system was a little overwhelming because of all the options. You ride in upwards of 100 elevators and manual saving felt tedious as the game went on. Some of the story was nonsensical - worthy of being made fun of.  There's some gravity gun-esque gameplay that felt tired and out of place, and sometimes you have to mash a button to get away from an enemy.","November 7, 2015","true","7.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

After worrying for hours how it would play, smoothly or choppy, on my ASuS laptop...\n\nThe game worked beautifully and dare I say even faster on here. The game has a lovely story as always, and after quitting the PS3 edition because of hatred to the controller gameplay, I am happy to say I will perservere and finally beat this god damn game. Here's the pros and cons:\n\nPROS:\n\n- Interesting Story\nIsaac Clarke has been admitted to a psychiactrics ward where he must escape. But beyond there, it's a terrifying        nightmare that pushes your tolerance to the ultimate limits.\n\n- Great Graphics\nEven for the worst computers, the graphics really stand out and work well for the game. The characters, being the most important in terms of detail, are stunning to say the least.\n\n- Weapons\nEvery survival game needs weapons. Well, except for Outlast™ and a few select others. Anywho, the weapons really stand out and are unique. They a small part consists of makeshift weapons, such as a surgical lazer and fire extinquisher. the rest are things like pulse rifles and spear guns, which are really cool as well.\n\n- Save, Shop, and Store Stations\nThis game would be horrifically hard without the features you find repeating in the areas of your journey. These are of course the save station, the item shop, the bench, and the numerous stasis chargers you find. The save station is pretty self explanitory, being where you can save your game. The item shop is where you can store items, buy items, and sell items. It's really needed for a game of this stature. The bench is useful too, giving you a place to upgrade armor and weapons, kinda like the enchanting table from Minecraft™.\n\nCONS:\n\n- Glitches\nEvery game has glitches, it's unavoidable. Even then, this goes in the list. I haven't run into many, but a few have been tht I found enemies stuck in walls and scenery, and falling through elevators happened on one rare occasion. Even then, it doesn't break immersion and this isn't that bad. It's actually kinda.. funny.\n\n- Multiplayer\nI know whatcha thinking; "Dood. How cud multiplayar b bad!?". Well, it's not the basic idea, the gameplay, or the entire thing itself. It's the lack of people. If you want to buy this game, don't do it for the sake of multiplayer. It's not going to work if you randomly match, and for that you should get a console release. But if you REALLY wanna play multiplayer, get a large group of friends (4-8) and then you're set.\n\nI'll update this as I continue playing. Right now, the rating it a 8/10.\n","November 7, 2014","true","5.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

You wake up in a mental hospital, because you keep having visions of hot babes, and they mess up your concentration. Suddenly the hospital is under attack by aliens, who have been hunting you for 11 years after you gambled with them and lost, but the fee you had to pay was too much so you made a break for it. Well, they found you after 11 years. You pick up a gun, which looks badass, and you have no idea how to use but it looks badass as I said, so you keep it, and don this EPIC space suit that attracts all the female aliens, but you're too good for them so you have to put them in stasis and break their limbs off. How complicated the life of a space plumber is with the relationships and the gambling and the guns!\n\nYou escape to a huge spaceship, and take shelter there. You meet some more aliens, and believe me this game doesn't get repetitive, since it's not like you shoot aliens throught the game or anything, I mean EA are smarter than that. You meet a woman, with one eye, who claims she can cure you from your hot babe visions. Suddenly, Isaac Clarke (that's you) goes from being a space plumber who always shows his crack while fixing the portal potties to a ladies man and alien hunter (just like how Abraham Lincoln became a Vampire Hunter). The jump scares don't get repetitive and this game is SUPER scary that you will probably get a heart attack while playing it. I highly recommend this game to people who love the ladies and shooting aliens. I DON'T recommend this to people who enjoy shooting aliens over and over again, because that is NOT what you do in this game.","November 26, 2013","true","0.8"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","2"

The first game shows a severed arm drifting into the emptiness. It illustrates the dangerous and desolate nature of space. The second game takes a more 'gamey' approach showing the player in a manly helmet. This should give you a rough idea on how they differ. What follows is a continued comparative analysis because why the hell not?!\n\nOne of the biggest issues with the first game was the oversupply of ammo. It was nothing but a hindrance to setting that despondent mood that I was yearning for. This game on Zealot (hardest difficulty available on first run through) does a better job, usually forcing you to micromanage and conserve your ammo by using other methods of necromorph destruction. The lighting is top notch and the sound is great, especially in zero gravity!\n\nOne would think these improvements would bump them scary vibes up to 11! Well have they? You've left behind the oppressive, flesh smeared corridors of the first game and been dropped into a more open, relatable environment. If you're wondering if the spritely decor of this game diminishes the levels of suspense driven apprehension you'd be right. Ooo did a toy just ominously roll into view in the next room? Sorry I was too busy investigating this rainbow for missing colours. Rarely did I have a lapse in composure. Only the black as pitch office/cafeteria and a slice off Chapter 10 offered enough atmosphere for me to take a vigilant approach. Furthermore the jumpscares aren't as plentiful as the first game. Less jump scares means better quality scares you say? Nah the lack of originality renders most of them as predictable as the discussion topics of a feminazi night out.\n\nEnough lollygagging about atmoscares!.. or jumpsphere! They introduced some new enemies in this game. From children swarming you in groups like you're the surrogate mother of mankind to enemies looking like a rejected pokemon, stampeding at you head first trying to sell the notion that living on one TM is effective. They sold it alright. While I admire Headbutt in the pokemon world it's the utmost annoyance in this game. Sitting in a corner waiting for the next one to charge is boring. Being aggressive can easily lead to your death as they'll usually one shot you on Zealot. Maybe I'm just bad but ♥♥♥♥ those things! If they managed not to give you an one way express pass to a funeral home, it's likely you banged them up with your super mega awesome range of weapons of which were improved from the first game. 5 or 6 weapons that I found were satisfyingly impactful as opposed to the mere 3 in the first game. Oh and kinesis impalement exists. What's not to love there?\n\nLove doesn't end there though. Once you finish the game you can play through it again in NG+ or restart naked with only 3 saves at your disposal. It's a nifty feature and more games should have it. Now the love ends. Many a time I leaped into vents like a highly trained rat but crawled through them like a centipede with my legs tied together. These vents are used to transition between some levels but to me it smells of a cop out by the level designers. Oh and who do I have to line gun in the face for including disappearing corpses? I earned that loot ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥it.\n\nIn Dead Space the desolate ship was a vehicle used to portray the eminence of atmosphere while the sequel threw you into a more approachable world. Ergo as a fear inducing chamber in pixel form it pales in comparison to the first but simply as a video game it's a step up from its predecessor and one of the most solid ones out there.","August 6, 2015","true","16.5"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","63","5","8","3","1"

The good news is that these have been improved in DEAD SPACE 2 and are no longer the issue they were in the original. (There are still some problems with camera angles when boxed into a corner but these are an irritation rather than a deal breaker.) DS2 also handles zero gravity in a far more intuitive, and enjoyable way, with none of the crazy hopping from one surface to another as in the first game. Now you can move freely, as you would expect. Also improved in DS2 is Isaac’s level of interaction. Now he speaks! This actually improves the experience more than might be expected, as it gives a greater sense that you’re involved in an unfolding story. The graphics are above average quality though not outstanding. The gameplay is improved by the introduction of more varied environments (although this is still very much a corridor shooter), and there are still plenty of tense moments when battling with enemies, some of which will be familiar if you played DS1, and some of which are new. When compared with the original DS2 is basically more of the same but with a number of welcome improvements and enhcncements. On a final note: I found it a little easier than the first, but that might be because of the improved controls and my familiarity with the gameplay second time around. Anyhoo, there’s still plenty of nerve-jangling fun to be had. Recommended, especially if you liked the original.\n\n4/5","December 1, 2013","true","25.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

While the third game clearly goes down the action route, this game finds a perfect balance between action, horror, and story. Isaac finally talks! He's now reacting to things, talking to people, connecting to people, and responding to his hallucinations. It gives the game's narrative a much stronger and believable feel this time around. The gameplay mechanics are largely the same, with some new tweaks and additions here and there.

But the down side to this is that it seems pretty liniar. Its story ties in fairly good to the first(and this done so even more when you fisit the Ishumrua). Isaccs marker broken mind makes his dillusions seem real at times, even with that orange glow to it. Stross was important in the fact he was a plot device driving the story untill Isacc (the ultra bad *ss of the universe) became a god to destroy the marker. And the marker seemed like another plot device as it was in the first; its all about the markers, and no one seems to relize the danger of these things. all in all 7/10 with a fair plot and acctualy giving Isaac a personality and a face, as for the plot devices these can be changed to other objectives.

Anyway this feels a lot more console based than PC based, but hey at least now I don't have to play WASD...\n\nGraphics have had a slight overhaul as wel as some new and very quick monsters...\n\nIt also advances the main story line from the Ishimura...\n\nOverall a good game.\n\n","June 19, 2014","true","13.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Oh, there were twists and turns throughout to give the illusion of a complicated Space Station etc but essentually you are rail-roaded all the way\nThe combat is tough, the creatures are scary and vary enough to not get overly predictable BUT some levels are capped by stupid little Quick-Time events that break the flow and apart from the last 2 chapters fights are a simple matter of:\nIs this an 'encounter' room/corridor? (You can tell almost as soon as the regularily spaced doors open if this is one of 'those' rooms)\nYes? Clear room No? Keep going\nwash rinse repeat  I did not sign on to the cr@ppy EA registration BUT still ended up having ALL the weapons and most of the Armour available to me at the very first purchase booth. There was no point hunting down schematics, it was obviously 'space Xmas' with free guns for all\n1st Person with the Oculus Rift would have made this game a heart-stopper BUT it is over-the-shoulder 3rd person which really weakened the experience for meI enjoyed the game. The story and back story was more than enough to keep me hooked in the whole way BUT it really just felt like playing with a 1st time  RPG Dungeon Master...

Even if the game doesn't scare you, the story is entertaining and the combat very fast-paced and challenging for a third person shooter.\n\nHave yet to beat the game, so this review will be updated whenI do, but so far I've had a fun, challenging ride. Note: I am playing on the second highest difficulty and only using the starting pistol, so maybe the game is actually a lot easier, but if you avoid using other items and just upgrade the pistol and armor, the game is much more interesting.\n\nAlso for those complaining about the DLC items, or new players to the game, do not buy the items in the store that cost $0. They are overpowered for the game and make the beginning sections really boring. Once you get to the point that you find at least one or two armor upgrades, then I'd say the free armor is fair game because it is basically the same thing.","May 31, 2014","true","11.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In both you've got a constant feeling like something is creeping around right behind you at every turn. Cranking up the difficulty Helps with the immersion and so does a good pair of headphones and a dark room.\n\nGameplay wise, Try to picture DS1 but with a few button swaps and polished, less "Tanky" Controls. The melee combat gets a much needed overhaul as in DS1 it felt more or less futile. The shooting mechanics are roughly the same, a bit awkward if you're not used to TPS style games, but it's easy to get used to. There's a pretty good variety of weapons to systematically turn enemies into a gooey red pulp as well as plenty of upgrades to apply to the various attributes. The Newgame+ mode is also a nice touch as it lets you keep your shiny new toys from your previous playthrough and even adds new equipment to unlock assuming you've met the pre-requisites.\n\nWeapons:\nPlasma Cutter: Imagine something like a pistol that fires a bolt of plasma in a vertical or horizontal line, depending on your chosen orientation.\n+Good damage at all difficulties\n+Plenty of upgrades and ammo is reasonably plentiful\n+Good against everything\n+sets enemies on fire when upgraded\n-Somewhat slow base rate of fire\n-great jack-of-all-trades but doesn't specialize in any field.\n9/10.\n\nPulse Rifle: Obligatory assault rifle, fires grenades and wrecks bunched up crowds of enemies, also good at shredding enemies if your aim is good or spray and pray if not.\n+Massively upgradable clip size\n~Pinpoint accuracy, could help or hinder based on players aim\n+Fires F*ckin' grenades\n+Great and most cost effective way to fight the Pack or Swarmers. Just tap your hold your left trigger and tap the rigt immediately before letting go of the left, otherwise you'll fire in 3 round bursts.\n-Grenades cost a ton of ammo and are pretty weak unless upgraded\n-Not very effective against bigger enemies or enemies you've gotta put down quickly (Stalkers for instance)\n-Chews through ammo pretty quickly\n7.5/10\n\nLine gun: Basically a bigger version of the plasma cutter, but instead of rotating its axis it instead fires mines.\n+Great damage, puts down enemies pretty quickly and efficiently\n+High damage mine is high damage.\n-Very slow moving projectile, can miss fast enemies.\n-You might damage yourself with your mines\n-Reasonable amount of ammo, but unless your aim is good, you'll constantly be scratching the bottom of the barrel.\n7/10.\n\nForce Gun: Imagine a very short range 'energy shotgun' that pretty much blows back everything on your screen.\n+Not much aiming required\n+long range alternate firing mode\n+Upgradable damage and can hit multiple enemies or even clear your immediate area with a few shots\n+Ammo is pretty easy to find.\n-Short range\n-Alt fire takes a second to charge, lead your targets!\n-Not as effective against enemies with weak points such as brutes or the tormentor.\n9/10\n\nRipper: A floating remote buzzsaw launcher.\n+Good damage and can be used in doorways to troll the pack\n+Can launch saw blades long distance\n-EXTREMELY short range, basically a melee weapon in its primary fire mode.\n-DoT weapon. The damage adds up quickly but if an enemy hits you, you'll lose your blade before it can damage them.\n-Blades last a set amount of time, regardless of use.\n-This one doesn't affect the gameplay any, but it's loud when it hits something. Mind your ears!\n5.5/10.\n\nSeeker Rifle: Basically a sniper rifle of sorts\n+Extremely high damage.\n+Zoom mode which boosts damage\n+Can put down most enemies pretty quickly\n-Very slow rate of fire\n-Requires good aim to use\n-Useless against swarms of fast moving enemies.\n\nContact Beam: Fires explosions and has AoE attack.\n+Great for big enemies\n+Instantly eviscerates most enemies\n+Highest damage\n+AoE explosions and a player AoE ground attack for dealing with crowded situations.\n-Slowest rate of fire\n-MUST charge every shot for a moment\n-If you miss, you're pretty boned until you charge up another shot\n-Most expensive and rarest ammo in the game\n7/10\n\nDetonator: Launches laser trip mines.\n+Sets up traps and trolls enemies that attempt to sneam around the player.\n+Launches explosive projectiles as opposed to proximity explosions.\n+can use the alt fire to undo mines\n-Objects and the player can trip the mines too.\n-Mines do high damage to the player and leave them helpless for a moment\n-Fast enemies might dodge mines\n-Mines have travel time\n8/10\n\nJaveline Gun: Or telemetry spike... whatever... Fires f*ckin' spears!?\n+Fires metal spikes which is awesome\n+Can impale enemies to walls and surfaces, instantly killing them regardless of damage\n+Alt fire electrocutes nearby enemies and can be upgraded\n+Penty of ammo.\n-Damage is lower than TK impalement\n-Hard to use in wide open areas\n8/10\n\nFlame thrower: Do I even need to write anything here?\n+Great close range weapon for small enemies\n+Launches explosive canisters\n-low initial damage, relies on DoT\n-Canister firing takes a ton of ammo\n6/10\n\nRivet gun: This is a DLC weapon, but basically a tiny Javeline Gun\nMostly the same as the javeline gun but with slightly different balance. Essentially has the same uses.\n8/10\n\nThe sprawl is fun to go through and the console exclusive Severed DLC is pretty fun. The only thing really lacking in this game was the loss of some of the helpless ness vibe that contributed to the horror atmosphere of the first game. The polished visuals in this game as well as the revamped combat mechanics and enemy AI more than make up for the sacrifice however as you find that even if the game doesn't scare you quite as much as its predecessor, there's now a variety of new enemies, environments, weapons and mechanics to explore.\nThe graphics are more polished than the first game, though they changed the characters' appearances pretty dramatically. I find that running the game in 'potato mode' takes away some of the atmosphere sadly, so if your PC can't handle it, you might get ripped off a bit there, but beyond that the game does a good job of instilling an atmosphere of panic early on.\nNot spoiling anything, but a few of the twists in the story were fairly predictable, though they still added something to intrigue the player.\nOverall I give the game a 9.5/10. A few bits and pieces lacked here and there, but I've had the game on console since a month after it's release and I still pick it up every few weeks to play through it again.","November 19, 2015","true","12.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The enemies are very similar to those in the original but that is fine because it makes sense with the storyline and Dead Space has some of the most unique enemies in any game of its kind.

However, the PC version includes all DLC except for Severed but many of the DLC suits are available free in the store. So it loses the challenge.

So much new games, so much info and reviews.\nTo be honest i expected to beat this games in 3 days because it looked easy. Turns out i was completely wrong and that you can't judge the game on the sole basis of reading a raview of a game.\n\nPlaying the game i discovered quite a lot of pro, a heap of stupidly talented gamers, and an overall ability to get it sorted slightly better than the non steam users. Not to say they weren't a heap of people who really didn't want to click the help menu, but a bit less than usual (in ratio, brute quantities were overwhelming sometimes :P)\nSo Bravo for that, but the most amazing part to me is something else. It's the fact that, especially during the last two days the level of assistance on the game was absolutely... completely... super amazing...\n\nFirst helpers, of course, were core members of the community, people here since the opening of the game. It was not a surprise to see them helping. But it was to see how much they helped. Friends have been spending a tremendous amount of time in and out helping me, spreading info, monitoring things.

On one hand, it is a made that is solid both in its mechanics and presentation. On the other, there is not much that is original or substantial about the experience. While presenting itself as a survival-horror experience, a feeling of helplessness and danger is all but removed by the games lack of dynamism. Enemies try very hard to kill you at every turn with little reprieve, and while the survival aspect is bolstered by the scarcity of ammunition and supplies, the journey becomes frustrating and stressful much more than it does scary as there is very little reward presented when overcoming challenges.\n\nThe graphics are gorgeous and characters are well acted and animated, especially Elly, whose who owes her voice and appearance to Sonita Henry of Star Trek fame. But even these nice touches do little to redeem the derivative, vapid story and tedious gameplay.","February 23, 2012","true","32.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Oh, there were twists and turns throughout to give the illusion of a complicated Space Station etc but essentually you are rail-roaded all the way\nThe combat is tough, the creatures are scary and vary enough to not get overly predictable BUT some levels are capped by stupid little Quick-Time events that break the flow and apart from the last 2 chapters fights are a simple matter of:\nIs this an 'encounter' room/corridor? (You can tell almost as soon as the regularily spaced doors open if this is one of 'those' rooms)\nYes? Clear room No?

There was no point hunting down schematics, it was obviously 'space Xmas' with free guns for all\n1st Person with the Oculus Rift would have made this game a heart-stopper BUT it is over-the-shoulder 3rd person which really weakened the experience for meI enjoyed the game. The story and back story was more than enough to keep me hooked in the whole way BUT it really just felt like playing with a 1st time  RPG Dungeon Master...

Isaccs marker broken mind makes his dillusions seem real at times, even with that orange glow to it. Stross was important in the fact he was a plot device driving the story untill Isacc (the ultra bad *ss of the universe) became a god to destroy the marker.

The necromorphs are back and Issac Clarke is on the run from Unitology and EarthGov. Dead space 2 is also loaded with more weapons and more RIG suits to suit your preference.  However, the PC version includes all DLC except for Severed but many of the DLC suits are available free in the store. So it loses the challenge. There is also a multiplayer mode in the game which I do not recommand buying the game if you want online. This is for the story. Oh, and Issac Clarke has a voice actor now.

Granted, Dead Space 2 makes you feel less vulnerable and the atmosphere of the original can't really be topped that easily, but the combat, characterization, story progression, character relatinships, enemy designs and attacks, mechanics, visuals and music, they're all absolutely fantastic in this second part. Dead Space 2 is bigger, better in several aspects, it's challenging enough without being cheap on Zealot and Hardcore and it's a hell of a lot of fun. The best thing they did was finally give Isaac a face and voice and went inside his broken mind. The Nicole sequences were always fantastic, especially the latter ones, and the Ellie banter was just great.\nThis is pretty much the refined Dead Space experience, with the exception of the opressive and lonelier nature of the first game's constant tone.

On one hand, it is a made that is solid both in its mechanics and presentation. On the other, there is not much that is original or substantial about the experience. While presenting itself as a survival-horror experience, a feeling of helplessness and danger is all but removed by the games lack of dynamism. Enemies try very hard to kill you at every turn with little reprieve, and while the survival aspect is bolstered by the scarcity of ammunition and supplies, the journey becomes frustrating and stressful much more than it does scary as there is very little reward presented when overcoming challenges.\n\nThe graphics are gorgeous and characters are well acted and animated, especially Elly, whose who owes her voice and appearance to Sonita Henry of Star Trek fame. But even these nice touches do little to redeem the derivative, vapid story and tedious gameplay.","February 23, 2012","true","32.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In both you've got a constant feeling like something is creeping around right behind you at every turn. Cranking up the difficulty Helps with the immersion and so does a good pair of headphones and a dark room.\n\nGameplay wise, Try to picture DS1 but with a few button swaps and polished, less "Tanky" Controls. The melee combat gets a much needed overhaul as in DS1 it felt more or less futile. The shooting mechanics are roughly the same, a bit awkward if you're not used to TPS style games, but it's easy to get used to. There's a pretty good variety of weapons to systematically turn enemies into a gooey red pulp as well as plenty of upgrades to apply to the various attributes. The Newgame+ mode is also a nice touch as it lets you keep your shiny new toys from your previous playthrough and even adds new equipment to unlock assuming you've met the pre-requisites.\n\nWeapons:\nPlasma Cutter: Imagine something like a pistol that fires a bolt of plasma in a vertical or horizontal line, depending on your chosen orientation.\n+Good damage at all difficulties\n+Plenty of upgrades and ammo is reasonably plentiful\n+Good against everything\n+sets enemies on fire when upgraded\n-Somewhat slow base rate of fire\n-great jack-of-all-trades but doesn't specialize in any field.\n9/10.\n\nPulse Rifle: Obligatory assault rifle, fires grenades and wrecks bunched up crowds of enemies, also good at shredding enemies if your aim is good or spray and pray if not.\n+Massively upgradable clip size\n~Pinpoint accuracy, could help or hinder based on players aim\n+Fires F*ckin' grenades\n+Great and most cost effective way to fight the Pack or Swarmers. Just tap your hold your left trigger and tap the rigt immediately before letting go of the left, otherwise you'll fire in 3 round bursts.\n-Grenades cost a ton of ammo and are pretty weak unless upgraded\n-Not very effective against bigger enemies or enemies you've gotta put down quickly (Stalkers for instance)\n-Chews through ammo pretty quickly\n7.5/10\n\nLine gun: Basically a bigger version of the plasma cutter, but instead of rotating its axis it instead fires mines.\n+Great damage, puts down enemies pretty quickly and efficiently\n+High damage mine is high damage.\n-Very slow moving projectile, can miss fast enemies.\n-You might damage yourself with your mines\n-Reasonable amount of ammo, but unless your aim is good, you'll constantly be scratching the bottom of the barrel.\n7/10.\n\nForce Gun: Imagine a very short range 'energy shotgun' that pretty much blows back everything on your screen.\n+Not much aiming required\n+long range alternate firing mode\n+Upgradable damage and can hit multiple enemies or even clear your immediate area with a few shots\n+Ammo is pretty easy to find.\n-Short range\n-Alt fire takes a second to charge, lead your targets!\n-Not as effective against enemies with weak points such as brutes or the tormentor.\n9/10\n\nRipper: A floating remote buzzsaw launcher.\n+Good damage and can be used in doorways to troll the pack\n+Can launch saw blades long distance\n-EXTREMELY short range, basically a melee weapon in its primary fire mode.\n-DoT weapon. The damage adds up quickly but if an enemy hits you, you'll lose your blade before it can damage them.\n-Blades last a set amount of time, regardless of use.\n-This one doesn't affect the gameplay any, but it's loud when it hits something. Mind your ears!\n5.5/10.\n\nSeeker Rifle: Basically a sniper rifle of sorts\n+Extremely high damage.\n+Zoom mode which boosts damage\n+Can put down most enemies pretty quickly\n-Very slow rate of fire\n-Requires good aim to use\n-Useless against swarms of fast moving enemies.\n\nContact Beam: Fires explosions and has AoE attack.\n+Great for big enemies\n+Instantly eviscerates most enemies\n+Highest damage\n+AoE explosions and a player AoE ground attack for dealing with crowded situations.\n-Slowest rate of fire\n-MUST charge every shot for a moment\n-If you miss, you're pretty boned until you charge up another shot\n-Most expensive and rarest ammo in the game\n7/10\n\nDetonator: Launches laser trip mines.\n+Sets up traps and trolls enemies that attempt to sneam around the player.\n+Launches explosive projectiles as opposed to proximity explosions.\n+can use the alt fire to undo mines\n-Objects and the player can trip the mines too.\n-Mines do high damage to the player and leave them helpless for a moment\n-Fast enemies might dodge mines\n-Mines have travel time\n8/10\n\nJaveline Gun: Or telemetry spike... whatever... Fires f*ckin' spears!?\n+Fires metal spikes which is awesome\n+Can impale enemies to walls and surfaces, instantly killing them regardless of damage\n+Alt fire electrocutes nearby enemies and can be upgraded\n+Penty of ammo.\n-Damage is lower than TK impalement\n-Hard to use in wide open areas\n8/10\n\nFlame thrower: Do I even need to write anything here?\n+Great close range weapon for small enemies\n+Launches explosive canisters\n-low initial damage, relies on DoT\n-Canister firing takes a ton of ammo\n6/10\n\nRivet gun: This is a DLC weapon, but basically a tiny Javeline Gun\nMostly the same as the javeline gun but with slightly different balance. Essentially has the same uses.\n8/10\n\nThe sprawl is fun to go through and the console exclusive Severed DLC is pretty fun. The only thing really lacking in this game was the loss of some of the helpless ness vibe that contributed to the horror atmosphere of the first game. The polished visuals in this game as well as the revamped combat mechanics and enemy AI more than make up for the sacrifice however as you find that even if the game doesn't scare you quite as much as its predecessor, there's now a variety of new enemies, environments, weapons and mechanics to explore.\nThe graphics are more polished than the first game, though they changed the characters' appearances pretty dramatically. I find that running the game in 'potato mode' takes away some of the atmosphere sadly, so if your PC can't handle it, you might get ripped off a bit there, but beyond that the game does a good job of instilling an atmosphere of panic early on.\nNot spoiling anything, but a few of the twists in the story were fairly predictable, though they still added something to intrigue the player.\nOverall I give the game a 9.5/10. A few bits and pieces lacked here and there, but I've had the game on console since a month after it's release and I still pick it up every few weeks to play through it again.","November 19, 2015","true","12.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

That they both are excellent survival horror games, that both are filled with immersion and that they both have great narrative and story. Those are just few thing Dead Space 1 and 2 have gotten right.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDead Space 1\n\nDead Space 1 was very atmospheric and i was scared ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ for the first 4 hours of the game.\n\n+ Lots of replay value\n+ Doesnt contain many jumpscares, it rather scares you with its tense and horrifying atmosphere\n+ Good story with good characters (nuff said)\n\n- Some annoying "puzzles" in the last few chapters\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDead Space 2\n\nDead Space 2 had a great narrative and plot. Gameplay was only improved, cool new enemies were added and Isaac was back, better than ever.\n\n+ Gameplay was slightly more action packed but i had its scary moments aswell. A great balance between them to be correct\n+ DS2 is full of thrilling and intense moments.\n+ The narrative was better this time and Isaac voiced made him instantly more likable.\n\n- I experienced some annoying bugs (weapons disapearing, infinite loading screen)\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSomething both games have in common\n\n+ Superior sound design (necromorphs sound so damn scary)\n+ Excellent survival gameplay\n+ Graphics looked fairly good even today when using ReShade graphical mod\n+ So much replay value\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nVerdict\n\nIf you like scary games, if you like survival horror, if you like atmosphere and if you want a good plot from a game.\n\nGo grab youself a Dead Space 1 and 2\n\nDead Space 1 - ( 9.4 )\n\nDead Space 2 - ( 9.7 )\n\nOne word...

A woman who can cure his mental issue. This game has a decent plot with the feeling of dread,agony and pain. A lot of pain. The shooting is executed nicely, using the Resource Intergration Gear to assist you. The shooting is innovative, including a vast amount of gore for the sensation of horror and suspense. The gore can be a bit overwhelming but it's considered creative and it makes the shooting much more addictive. Dead Space 2 is rememberable for the blood but not for it's emotional characters and gameplay. Some chapters do feel repetitive at times or the objective just felt pointless. The scenery is a bit too bland for me, causing me to loss interest in some chapters. Dead Space 2 had some positve touches of third-person shooting that most games don't bring to the table but I really wish it was more emotional for the story it held.  Sometimes cinematic/emotional touches can uplift the intensity or emotion of a game but they failed to do so. Along with some of the missions feeling dull, they kept you on your feet with amusement being properly used when needed. If you like the sight of blood....or shooting unique creatures in the eyes, you will most likely enjoy this game. If you're expecting anything more...don't purchase it. I'll give it a 7.1/10","February 17, 2015","true","15.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I played it for more than 10 times now and well, the developers didn't really care for fixing the game. The rubber foam bonus weapon unlock is not fixed, multiplayer could use some text chat and a push talk features. Enabling the microphone by default is annoying. You can hear static, annoying static.\n\nFor personal preference, the game could use random enemy spawn similar to Left 4 Dead because after playing the game several times, it's easy to predict when and where the enemies will spawn. With random enemy spawning, the game will be less predictable and different every time you run through a corridor.\n\nFor the graphics, it's great. The lighting engine is impressive, but there are some instances they cut corners to reduce graphical load for the console versions. For example, your helmet lights illuminate a totally dark room and it's totally absent in another area.\n\nOther than that, it's a great game and I highly recommend this to everyone.","April 30, 2012","true","31.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The suit system returns too, but this time each suit has it's own little bonus, like giving you a discount at the store. They even redid the Zero Gravity parts so you have full control over your character.\nA few new enemies have been added, including an enemy that uses cover then tries to sneak behind you.\n\nOverall the game feels like a sequel instead of just a modded add on or DLC.

Well, from the VERY BEGINNING of the game, you have access to many different weapons (and I think even armor suits) that you normally would not. Not to mention, it's all completely free.\n\nNow, this is just me, but personally, I do not like having all this extra crap available to me because it really hurts the whole "resource management" aspect of the game. And the survival horror aspect in general. The game is simply easier with the ability to get all of these different guns for free.\n\nAt least at one point, there was a means (albeit convoluted) of removing the DLC from the game, but it meant reverting to a previous version of the game with less updates/patches. I think that's just stupid. You should be able to disable the DLC prior to starting a new campaign game.\n\nBut despite that, this game still gets a "thumbs up" because it's just that good.

Very satisfying\n+ Had to be very resourceful and patient. (At least on the Zealot difficulty)\n+ Good story and voice acting\n+ Plasma Cutter is Bae\n\nCons\n- The DLC. Let me explain... The Steam version includes all the DLC for the game which is cool but its all overpowered weapons and suits for single player that are literally free from shops in the game from the very start. Personally I didn't use them for the fact it would just ruin the game for me. It was annoying having to navigate through all the DLC items cluttering up the shops through out the game.\n- Crawlers\n\nOverall a great game and one of the best survival horror games I've played. A massive improvement in almost every way over its predecessor (Which was still a really good game).\n\nFinal Score - ★★★★☆","January 17","true","16.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

However I'm glad I finally came around to play and finish it because it's a great game. Graphically it's still a good looker, even in 2015 (though the textures on the armor could be a little bit better /nitpicking ), the sound design is amazing and more than once the eeriness was kept by only the music. That said this one isn't as scary as the first one mainly because of two reasons. The first one being is that now Isaac knows what's happening around him (you also know that he pretty much kicks ♥♥♥) and the second one is that in some parts of the game, instead of carefully constructed encounters, the enemy monsters just keep on coming, so it's more action oriented. Another negative aspect is that sometimes the game takes away the control from the player (these are not cinematic but in game scenes) and you can't skip them or do anything at all.

I spent the most of the play through using the plasma cutter. I even posted a negetive review, about how the story was a bit bland. But after going to the end, I was surprised at the twist at the end, it was refreshing.\n\nBut the sequel is so much better! Smoother movements, more weapons, more armor, SO much better zero-g game play. The fast that Isaac is now a vocal character and actually is a character that serves to drive the story forward besides just killing stuff was a little off putting at first, but I got used to it fast. And I have a weakness for totally bad ♥♥♥ ass kicking, super hot girls with subtle british accents, (Miranda Lawson was my weakness), and Ellie is an awesome character.\n\nI'm only on chapter 9, but the fact that you can mow down hoards of deranged deformed children, shot kamakazie babies and make them explode, and nobody asks any questions... just makes this game so far above par it's stupid.

I didn't mind though, it gave me variety in what I got to use so I'm not complaining.\n\nI never even clicked multiplayer and also I only played this game through once so no idea what those add to the game, I really didn't care about those. I will say I really enjoyed this game, it was probably the first game I found genuinely scary in a long time. When you're not getting over run by aliens jumping right in your face and still advancing even after you shoot their legs off (using their claws) you are wandering around paranoid to hell waiting for them to swarm you. Some really nicely done aliens in here that remind me of the raptors in the kitchen on Jurassic Park (film) where you are getting hunted. You can hear them making noises somewhere in the dark and then you see what looks like a head peaking around behind a box but as you go to shoot it runs back behind and sprints off. Damn packs of the things zipping round really fast, leaping over large containers and jumping at you is quite scary.\n\nSome parts got very irritating when I kept dying, particularly when I died after a silly animation scene type thing and had to watch the stupid thing each time. Also I found the end very hard (and at times a bit frustrating) when I kept dying and had to wait for it to load all the time (even with an SSD it wasn't the fastest). I played through on 'survivalist' which I think is the 'hard' option,\n\nAll in all I did enjoy this and it was scary throughout and I tend not to find things scary. I bought this in a sale and it lasted about 12 hours so well worth whatever I paid for it. There is game mode+ which would extend it's life, it's an oldish game now so I can't see multiplayer adding anything now. I don't really play single player games more than once but you get extra stuff one new game+ which will add for some people. I never played Dead Space 1 and I felt I didn't miss anything from not knowing the previous story.\n\nSee this in a sale, pick it up.","March 27, 2014","true","14.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DeathWantsMore/recommended/47780/","DeathWantsMore","DeathWantsMore","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DeathWantsMore/","36 products in account","This is definitely a good game. But unfortunately it's worse than Dead Space, I understand why - beating such quality is not an easy task. The atmosphere and core gameplay is still here in Dead Space 2 and tweaked to a certain extent, some things have been improved and honestly I don't have much negativity to say about it, maybe just that it's way too similar to Dead Space? Like it's a bad thing, huh? Enemy variety makes things interesting when you encounter new necromorphs and trying to establish some new strategies versus them.\n\nSo, what's worse then? Pretty much everything else. It's not entirely bad it's just sub par or worse than what Dead Space offered:\n\nVery simplistic level design. There's no map this time and it's not even needed there's almost always only one door to enter.\nLevel transitions are usually a QTE/Action scenes which leaves you wondering where the hell you ended up this time, usually you'll partially understand this by reading logs and/or from random intercom messages from various characters. For example in Dead Space there was a monorail and in the wagon you could see a ship scheme so that you understand better where are you heading right now. In Dead Space 2 it's just a sp@stic (this word is censured, wtf steam?) chaos and you'll never be able to fully understand Isaacs route.\nCharacters are much less likable and some are stupidly annoying, like one of the antagonists which always spams your intercom with cheesy threats, like "NOW IT'S OVER!" or "YEAH, NOW IT'S DEFINITELY OVER!" when it's obvious that it's not... All other characters are "meh" as well, and their further development is rather disappointing. On a plus side Isaac brakes his numb record from Ishimura and now talks, sometimes even way too much.\nPlot is, well, it's much less intriguing to say the least. It's just covers nothing interesting and doesn't really develop Markers/Necromorphs story either.\nYou won't find any bosses in this game, that's really disappointing.\nOn top of that - last part of the game is just big a run-through, dodging some re-used hobo from the original and his friends. That is really really lazy. In Dead Space there was that Marker delivery trip with a lot of fighting and ended up in an amazing boss fight for instance.\nThe good thing is that atmosphere is still pretty grim, new weapons spicing up gameplay in a different ways, RIGs now have special effects and kinesis module is now an awesome tool to kill necromorphs very fast. Now you can freely fly around in Zero Gravity, which is very cool. 5 Difficulty levels this time around with hardcore mode which allows to have only 3 saves throughout the whole game and no checkpoints, it's pretty cool, harder difficulties forces you to use environment to your advantage not just shoot in everything that moves since you'll run out of supplies very fast that way.  Basically - the gameplay is the only thing here that you shouldn't worry about, it's here, it's tweaked and won't disappoint.\n\nDead Space 2 is not a masterpiece like Dead Space, it thrives on the elements of the original game and doing very little to be called a masterpiece on it's own. I still recommend everyone to play it since the quality of this game is astounding and it's a rare thing these days.\n\n7/10.","December 7, 2015","true","19.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Harley365/recommended/47780/","Harley365","Harley365","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Harley365/","213 products in account","The “Previously, on Dead Space” video is a nice touch, though it reminds me how similar Dead Space 2's premise and gameplay are to the last one. This time Isaac Clarke awakens on a facility on Saturn's moon Titan, three years after the rescue-mission-gone-awry on the mining ship Ishimura, and finds a very familiar situation: Titan is overrun with space zombies called Necromorphs that have set about the meticulous dismemberment of everyone in sight—and he's still having hallucinations of his dead girlfriend.\n\nIt also highlights that DS2 is a better sci-fi horror game, in a lot of subtle but important ways. While the plot is similar, the storytelling technique has changed for the better—Isaac has recovered from a bout of Gordon Freeman Syndrome (inexplicable muteness), and the voice performances are excellent. But the real star is the environment: for the entirety of the eight-hour campaign, Visceral does an expert job of making you feel in constant peril, alternating between tingling your spine with unsettling scenery and audio and trying to rip it out of your body by way of horrific monsters.\n\nThis is what happens if you play Twister during the space-zombie apocalypse.\nNew blood\n\nFighting a Necro is different from other videogame enemies, in that shooting its head is like shooting a grizzly in the foot—it barely slows it down, and just makes it angrier. Picking off limbs takes them down quicker, requiring multiple accurate shots per target—which makes the smooth controls greatly appreciated.\n\nDS2 has a zoo's worth of different varieties of spitting, charging, wall-crawling nasties (including evil space-babies), and each puts up a hell of a fight. The first time I was hunted by the new Stalkers was one of the most frightening moments of the game—I caught a shadowy movement behind some crates out of the corner of my eye, but I found nothing there. I heard a chirping noise, and spun around to see a velociraptor-like creature charging toward me. With a scream it smashed me to the floor, then nimbly darted away, intelligently using cover to escape before I could hit its legs. Then, more chirping—and I realized I was surrounded. Clever girl.\n\nStalkers are swift, agile pack hunters. Also, they're jerks.\n\nMost of the 15 stages have a unique look to them (as unique as possible given that they're mostly metal corridors), from the wrecked residential areas to the Necro-worshiping Unitologist temple to the EarthGov zone, and they're punctuated by floaty zero-G areas. You have all the same tools as before—the upgradable Rig suit is equipped with time-slowing and telekinesis powers—but the levels are designed well and don't overuse any one gimmick. That includes enemies that must be defeated by blasting their glowing yellow bits.\n\nThe new multiplayer owes a lot to Left 4 Dead's example: four human players fight their way through a gauntlet of objectives while four class-based Necro players and AI-controlled backup zombies assail them from all sides. It's fun, and produces some nail-biting finishes, but aside from making you unlock equipment with experience (which I don't personally care for), it doesn't do anything we haven't seen before.\n\nNo you idiot, don\'t shoot it in the head!\n\nOverall, besides retaining the irritation of having to seek out a save station to avoid losing progress when I want to quit, DS2 is a smartly improved version of the original. It's not a new experience, but it's a hair-raiser nonetheless.\n\nTHE VERDICT\n90/100\nDead Space 2\nAn excellent action-horror sequel. Dead Space 2 doesn’t try to innovate, but it’s a highly polished alien-rending experience.","June 15, 2015","true","3.4"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","1"

Dead Space 2 is old slightly but frankly I enjoy the Dead Space series. And the second instalment is my favourite. My first playthrough was on console. I was utterly frightened because of the fact that the developers really timed the moments perfectly for a Necromancer to come slicing into the vent your crawling through. I also love the fact that you can upgrade your weapons and buy new suits to take on the Necromancer horde, And the developer's really done well by placing you on a intergalactic city with these creatures. Playing now on PC is different but better because the controls are really easy. The story is great aswell. The only problem is the multiplayer. It wasn;t what I expected. I liked the idea of humans against Necromancers but I tried it and I did not enjoy it. I just does not flow like the singleplayer. Over all. great game with a good story. I recommed to anyone if they enjoy a really great story with gameplay that builds tension.","June 28, 2014","true","4.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It sort of ruins the surprise when you have a foolproof way of knowing when your enemy is not dead.  On the other hand, maybe this isnt a bug... but it certainly does rain on the old phrase "when in doubt, stomp it out" since there is NEVER any doubt that an enemy is alive or dead with the kinesis trick.\n\nSince dead space 1 gave me no trouble on the regular setting and I thought it was too easy, I decided to play this one on the hard setting the first time through... and this one is notably more difficult, but it also probably has to do with my choice to upgrade the pulse rifle and line beam as my top weapons.  I should have stuck with my plasma cutter.\n\nBest weapons:\n1) Plasma Cutter (favorite from last game too)\n2) Ripper (actually, very versatile, way more useful than it was in the first game... only problem is you gotta get up close... so you pretty much need full kinesis for this to be effective, bad against the guys that freeze you and guys that blow up... good against everything else, can beat really powerful bosses with 2-4 blades and a couple kinesis blasts)\n3) Seeker Rifle (powerful, but slow... bad in close quarters)\n4) Detonator.... (this is easily the best weapon to use against the most difficult to deal with enemy in the game, which are these guys who stalk you and do organized attacks)\n5) Force gun (good versus almost all enemies, especially when being swarmed or in close quarters, not so good in open spaces)\n6) Flame thrower (better option than the pulse rifle... handles similarly, isnt a piece of crap like it was in the first game)\n7) Line Gun (powerful if you aim it right)\n8) Pulse Rifle (lots of ammo, but very weak, not good against the stalkers)\n9) Contact Beam (good, slow, doesnt carry a lot of ammo, must have good aim)\n10) Javelin (slow, powerful)\n11) Rivet gun (total piece of crap, dont know why they even bothered including it in the game)\n\nThe rivet gun is basically useless.\n\nFor chapter 15(last level), the ideal 3 weapons to bring are:\n1) Ripper (to get through the hoards of enemies and regenerating ones)\n2) Force gun or line gun(force gun is better)... to keep the little enemies from swarming you during the final boss battle.\n3) And the Seeker rifle OR Javalin... for the final boss itself.\n\nBut in reality, the plasma cutter is so versatile it is the overall best weapon to bring if you can only afford to take one(which should be the case in your first playthrough).\n\nIn your first playthrough.. you want to focus on upgrading your suit(only 1 air upgrade is really necessary, if even), your kinesis, and your plasma cutter... and then spend the rest on a second weapon upgrade(maybe the force gun or line gun for the last boss)\n\nLike in the first game: Make sure you upgrade capacitiy for weapons when you are empty on ammo(before reloaded) or when you are low... you will get a free ammo refil.\nSame goes for health: upgrade health capacity when you are low on health(free health refill).\nAlso: buy a new suit when you are low on health(free health refill)","November 9, 2015","true","47.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Like most horror game sequels it "opens up" the setting to something far more epic than a mere Haunted House romp, but whether this is a good or bad thing is up to individual taste, one suspects.  A part of me still votes in favour of the "purity" of the somewhat narrower setting of the earlier game, but if they HAD to mess all that up with a sequel, you really couldn't have asked for a better job.  Looking forward to the third one, though the question is slowly arising:  How many more Dead Spaces can they do before the premise becomes a tad exhausted?  Only time will tell...\n\nVerdict: 9/10.","October 22, 2013","true","47.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","2"

Dead Space 2 is old slightly but frankly I enjoy the Dead Space series. And the second instalment is my favourite. My first playthrough was on console. I was utterly frightened because of the fact that the developers really timed the moments perfectly for a Necromancer to come slicing into the vent your crawling through. I also love the fact that you can upgrade your weapons and buy new suits to take on the Necromancer horde, And the developer's really done well by placing you on a intergalactic city with these creatures. Playing now on PC is different but better because the controls are really easy. The story is great aswell. The only problem is the multiplayer. It wasn;t what I expected. I liked the idea of humans against Necromancers but I tried it and I did not enjoy it. I just does not flow like the singleplayer. Over all. great game with a good story.

It sort of ruins the surprise when you have a foolproof way of knowing when your enemy is not dead.  On the other hand, maybe this isnt a bug... but it certainly does rain on the old phrase "when in doubt, stomp it out" since there is NEVER any doubt that an enemy is alive or dead with the kinesis trick.\n\nSince dead space 1 gave me no trouble on the regular setting and I thought it was too easy, I decided to play this one on the hard setting the first time through... and this one is notably more difficult, but it also probably has to do with my choice to upgrade the pulse rifle and line beam as my top weapons.  I should have stuck with my plasma cutter.\n\nBest weapons:\n1) Plasma Cutter (favorite from last game too)\n2) Ripper (actually, very versatile, way more useful than it was in the first game... only problem is you gotta get up close... so you pretty much need full kinesis for this to be effective, bad against the guys that freeze you and guys that blow up... good against everything else, can beat really powerful bosses with 2-4 blades and a couple kinesis blasts)\n3) Seeker Rifle (powerful, but slow... bad in close quarters)\n4) Detonator.... (this is easily the best weapon to use against the most difficult to deal with enemy in the game, which are these guys who stalk you and do organized attacks)\n5) Force gun (good versus almost all enemies, especially when being swarmed or in close quarters, not so good in open spaces)\n6) Flame thrower (better option than the pulse rifle... handles similarly, isnt a piece of crap like it was in the first game)\n7) Line Gun (powerful if you aim it right)\n8) Pulse Rifle (lots of ammo, but very weak, not good against the stalkers)\n9) Contact Beam (good, slow, doesnt carry a lot of ammo, must have good aim)\n10) Javelin (slow, powerful)\n11) Rivet gun (total piece of crap, dont know why they even bothered including it in the game)\n\nThe rivet gun is basically useless.\n\nFor chapter 15(last level), the ideal 3 weapons to bring are:\n1) Ripper (to get through the hoards of enemies and regenerating ones)\n2) Force gun or line gun(force gun is better)... to keep the little enemies from swarming you during the final boss battle.\n3) And the Seeker rifle OR Javalin... for the final boss itself.\n\nBut in reality, the plasma cutter is so versatile it is the overall best weapon to bring if you can only afford to take one(which should be the case in your first playthrough).\n\nIn your first playthrough.. you want to focus on upgrading your suit(only 1 air upgrade is really necessary, if even), your kinesis, and your plasma cutter... and then spend the rest on a second weapon upgrade(maybe the force gun or line gun for the last boss)\n\nLike in the first game: Make sure you upgrade capacitiy for weapons when you are empty on ammo(before reloaded) or when you are low... you will get a free ammo refil.\nSame goes for health: upgrade health capacity when you are low on health(free health refill).\nAlso: buy a new suit when you are low on health(free health refill)","November 9, 2015","true","47.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Unlike most I considered the original's most impressive aspect to be the unique enemy design and weapon combat.  While I loved how well executed the monster closet horror was, I didn't find it as monumental as certain psychological horror games like Silent Hill or FEAR, so the change in tone found in Dead Space 2 wasn't a big deal to me and I really appreciated all the subtle improvements to the gameplay.\n\nIf your love for Dead Space came from the atmospheric sense of isolation, then you'll probably be disappointed by the frantic and sometimes bombastic nature of Dead Space 2, although it's not completely without it's quieter suspenseful moments.\n\nThe heavier story broadens the Dead Space universe similarly to how the film Aliens did for Alien.  That metaphor can be used to describe the stylistic differences to the two games as well.\n\nRegardless of whichever way you prefer, Dead Space 2 is a good game.","February 7","true","13.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Isaac Clarke became a dancer in this game if how often I make him stomp the yard (or enemies if we're splitting hairs here) is any indicator.  The environment and the overall survival-adventure genre gives your heart a steady workout as you play the game, but nothing too drastic to keep you from copping out.\n\nDespite all this however, I would have to give this game review a solid no.  And it's because the programmer for this game thought he was really funny and proceeded to ♥♥♥♥ up the programming or something for Dead Space 2.  More often than not, when you try to reload or respawn, there will be times where you will respawn empty-handed.  As in no weapons, which means not even the chance to perform melee haymakers.  You are straight up walking around empty-handed like a dumbass badass straight into a necromorph thinking you hot ♥♥♥♥ and all that only for you to expectedly get torn a new one.  Yes i've checked my inventory, yes i've tried to reequip my handy-dandy plasma cutter.  Nothing.  You're only option left is to reload the game again (if your dumbass saved while knowing this happened, you might very well have permanently lost that item forever unless you start a new game completely, fully-upgraded or not).  If you have really bad luck when you reload a last save, you might be caught in the loading screen forever until you decide to just quit the program itself and reload the last save (goodbye hours of progress).\n\nBut my biggest issue with this game is that for whatever the ♥♥♥♥ reason, EA thought it was a good idea to give the player every DLC weapon/armor at the start of the game, doesn't matter if you started fresh or beated the game.  From the moment you reach the first shop in the game, it's decked with weapons that can fill your inventory and armor that gives some pretty decent buffs.  Whats worse is that all of these DLC are free, no credits are needed.  If you're like me and you like the challenge of grinding through a game and actually earning your upgrades, then this is a serious turn off.  One can suggest to just ignore these free stuff and play the game as is, but the fact that these items exist at all without our say leaves a bad taste to the mouth.  There is a way to manually turn the DLC off through coding, but honestly the fact that you have to go through all that at all just to play a vanilla version of a game is jsut disgusting.\n\nSo to sum it all off, ignoring all the flaws that i've listed out, the gameplay overall is still similar to the first Dead Space we all played and enjoyed (or hated, i don't know how you roll).  It's still fun to literally curb stomp the ♥♥♥♥ on not just your enemies, but also dead civilians into delicious chunks.  My recommendation is that you take these complaints into serious consideration (check Google, it's not just me having these problems) and to get this game ONLY if it's on a serious sale or is given to you free.","June 4","false","4.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

Believe me, playing DS2 on normal difficulty IS challenging and have nothing to do with DS 1 Normal difficulty; here, at the middle of a game, I was starving for supplies, and each combat was unique since I had to use everything I could find to survive out there. Finding a medkit felt like a God's blessing. I don't even know what to expect from hardest difficulty, but that is gonna be a heck of a challenge for sure.\n\nOverall, this is one of these games you have to play if you consider yourself being a gamer. It's just... too good to miss it.\n\nP.S.

I've somewhat touched on the story mode, but the multiplayer is quite fun. it has the Call of duty style level-up-and-get-new-♥♥♥♥ and stepping into the shoes of a necromorph is definatly a change of scenery and a great change to the game. the enemy variety certainly keeps you on your toes, from small packs of pac, to the flying infectors. the game has it's bosses, from the armored brute to issac's own mind. and its got those necromorphs that are put in there like the exploders and the exploder/lurker crossbreed thing. gameplay is a bit different from the third game, as im not seeing as many human enemies, and there isnt a real "sprint" (if there is, im officialy stupid) theres always the classic curbstomping and melee combat, and the weapons youre given vary a small bit, from the old plasma cutter, to the line gun and spear-shooty-thingy. the variety of weapons and enemies makes for a unique playstyle.\n\ni definatly see myself playing this again after i beat it\n\nand go play #3 it isnt as bad as people say it is, ya'll need to stop comparing it to this game.\n(shut up about how i just compared the two)","December 29, 2013","true","4.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

That being said I would like to point out some things I didnt like. When you get to the first store the game basicly throws you an upgraded version of every single wepon and armor. Some of you might think that this is awesome, you get every gun in the game for free, but to me it makes the game lose its magic. I first played the game on the Xbox 360 and my favorite part of the game is the fact that you have to be smart with your money and recorces in order to win. I would cary around a contact beam just so that i could sell its ammo for 1,000 credits when i reached the store. Every single time i would reach a store i would change from whatever suit i was wearing into the vintage suit just to make the prices go down, i would make my purcases and then change back to my previous suit. Since i carefully played the entire game like this it made newgame plus so rewarding because everything i had i earned. On this version of the game however i didnt get that experiance. I was basicly handed eerything i had worked so hard to get on the 360. As i mentioned at the begining this is a great game and i highly recomend it, but i wish that the free wepons and armor were only given to you after you beat the game once.","December 21, 2013","true","29.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/grenadeh/recommended/47780/","grenadeh","Grenadeh","http://steamcommunity.com/id/grenadeh/","961 products in account","Dead Space 2 is an excellent follow-up to what is easily the best new survival horror game since Fatal Frame or Silent Hill, and at the time was definitely the only franchise still bringing the pain. Much more than you can say for Resident Evil for sure. The game features improved graphics, a more thoroughly grounded story that expands both before and after the events of Dead Space to create a living world, and much more action than the original.\n\nThat's both a good and bad thing, as DS2 is clearly more action oriented and paved the way for the action game that ended up being Dead Space 3, but at least in this title the survival horror still comes to the surface as much as possible. New space mechanics allow for 360 degree space/zero-g movement, the game is packed with new weapons and old, and it also gives you plenty of new suits each with their own advantages and disadvantages. The whole game is an explosive thriller with great pacing that almost makes up for abandoning most of the horror elements of the original. Even keeping that in mind, Dead Space 2 is a great game that deserves to be called a masterpiece in its own regard, even if it is different from Dead Space.\n\n101/10 would buy again, even though I already have 4 copies.","January 7","true","3.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The Horror elements are reduced to jump scares and grotesque violence, rather than using the environment and our imaginations to install fear. There's less a sense of Isolation and Confusion as your lead by a carrot through hordes of monsters. The lack of any boss battles and over usage of quick time events are other shortcomings.","December 23, 2014","false","20.4"," 15 of 32 people (47%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","47","15","32","3","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/stiverton/recommended/47780/","stiverton","Stiverton","http://steamcommunity.com/id/stiverton/","120 products in account","Pros:\n-A variety of unique weapons that allow for slightly varied combat approaches.\n-An equipment custimization system that is easy to use and provides opportunity for player choice.\n-Some interesting puzzle elements not often found in the genre.\n-Visual design is quite good in most areas.\n-Creates a strong atmosphere of dread, terror, and horror in some areas.\n-Good graphics quality, even for 2015, lots of well rendered gore.\n\nCons:\n-Aside from a few unique enemies, most enemy designs follow the exact same formula.\n-Level design is very repetitive, be prepared for many enemy-filled corridors.\n-The game is quite dark, and although you have a flashlight on your gun, in some areas it's just an annoyance instead of being scary.\n-The 3rd quarter of the game onwards gets super grindy with just tons and tons of enemies being thrown at you.\n-The difficulty of the game does not flow well.  In the early parts, even the difficulty above normal is easy, in the later half, even normal can be frustratingly difficult.  Higher difficulty does not really make the game more challenging in a fun way and instead simply makes to so you die way more easily.\n-This game is full of shrieks and loud static noises.  I had to turn the sound down because it was causing headaches.\n-It's a gore-fest.\n\nI am not reccommending this game because I think that in trying to be a action-horror hybrid, it falls short of each of it's parent genres in many ways.  Dead Space 2 is not a terrible game, but it is also pretty forgetable, and doesn't really excel in any way.\n\nIf you are looking for a gory space horror shooter to romp through I would recommend trying to pick it up on sale for a good price (<$10) and don't be averse to playing on a low difficulty.\n\n(Note: the game comes with a bunch of free DLC weapons and armor which can trivialize the game.  If you want to have the original experience, do not purchase any weapons or armor from the store that cost 0 credits)","November 11, 2015","false","10.1"," 8 of 18 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","8","18","0","0"

Keep in mind this is my personal opinion and if you are among the majority of people who enjoyed this game, then good for you, you can move on.\n\nI am a Silent Hill enthusiast, I like horror games and so on but Dead Space 2 is not a scary game. Of course, most people tend to ♥♥♥♥ their pants whenever a light flicks but if you aren't easily scared chances are you will find this game boring, tedious and tiresome. I thought the first game wasn't too bad despite being a tad frustrating at times, but blimey I wasn't prepared for the amount of frustration this one can create.\n\nFirst off, if you purchased this game and you expected to play it right away, you won't. EA will ask you to login with your EA account and they will try to convince you to do it by telling you you'll miss on some 'amazing' bonus content. But you can skip that part and avoid spending an hour trying remember what password your useless EA account had. Which is nice.\n\nThe game is filled with QTE which I'm not a fan of but I usually don't mind. But crickey, Dead Space 2's QTE are terrible. For some reasons you can't just casually press E but you have to mash it like a maniac and still, sometimes you end up dying anyway. It's like you are meant to die and enjoy your death scene - because dying is so much fun - and retry. My childhood was essentially me playing Metal Gear Solid so I know how to repeatedly press a single key, thanks to the torture part, and Dead Space 2's QTE are essentially MGS' torture part. Every five minutes.\n\nThe atmosphere of the game isn't too bad but it's completely ruined by the staggering amount of cheap jumpscares. When will game developers get that jumpscares aren't scary, they are just downright irritating. It wouldn't be so bad if they actually had just a few of them but no, the entire atmosphere is based on that. This clearly doesn't help you getting into the story, which by the way, is utterly predictable and cliché. Not once, was I even slightly surprised by any of the "plot twists". Even Dead Space 1 managed to do that.\n\nYou are also supposed to do every tiny action which adds absolutely nothing to the experience. I can't remember how many times I asked myself "Am I actually supposed to do something or is this a cinematic?". And sometimes, the game also expects you to figure out stupid stuff you were never asked to do before like holding E instead of just pressing it. I did every single action just by pressing E, how am I supposed to figure out for this ONE action in the game I am supposed to hold E. I am not even kidding, there's actually some bloke in the devs team who thought for this ONE SINGLE ACTION it would add a lot to the game if you had to hold E instead of just pressing it. Unbelievable.\n\nIt might sound like details to you, but believe me this ruins the entire purpose of a game, which is to be enjoyable. The only thing I was looking forward to was the end, so I could just let this game rot in my Steam library and never hit the play button ever again. But guess what, those were the longest 12 hours of gameplay in my entire life. This game feels like it never ends. Not to mention they thought it'd be a brilliant idea if that massively annoying regenerating necromorph would come and chase you while dozens of enemies keep spawning all around you.I won't even mention the final boss fight.\n\nOverall this game is a huge let down. They apparently managed to make Dead Space 3 even worse but I find it hard to believe. There are a few nice things to say about this game like the details they added into the environment and level design. Isaac feels less "stiff" and moving around feels way more natural. You can also kill babies and children which is something I wished games like Skyrim allowed you to do. But that's not enough to compete with the tremendous amount of problems this game has.","May 2","false","11.2"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","3","8","0","0"

I did not.\n\nIt's not like "Dead Space 2" is complete waste of time and money. It's just... great example that putting proven elements in one jar and making game of them is simply not enough. Dark environment? Checked. But instead of creating atmosphere of fear and danger. Something chocking? Checked. This time it's necromorph infested kindergarden. And come on... How many times we saw juxtapose of defnesless and innocent kid-stuff with something gore, hoping that the contrast will hit the viewer? Generally locations are poor and repetitive. While devs managed to avoid backtracking, they did not put much work in location design and you will walka lot through mirror imige of location you were just before... More - "WTF is happening?!" strat? Checked. Been there. Done that. Dozens of times. Plot twist? Checked. Unfortunately they are so predictable... And of course - some scary paranormal stuff. Checked as well. But again, ghost of Nicole is more irritating than scary. You can barely understand what she is saying. And when you do you will realize it has little sense.\n\n"Dead Space 2" has it's strong point. Like guns. I'm pretty sure everybody will find something for themselves. Personally  I favored combination of Plasma Cutter (one of few things that are awesome), Pulse Rifle, Seeker Rifle and Javelin Gun. Also graphics quality is really good. There are also few good movie-like parts. But too few, even for such a short game. Oh, and to be honest - since Chapter 12 interesting stuff starts. But whole games has 15 chapters.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ROMANOWS/recommended/47780/","ROMANOWS","subversiveVectorMachine","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ROMANOWS/","145 products in account","Throughout the game I was leaning towards a weak "not-recommended" rating, even though the maps were neat and there are worse ways to spend a handful of hours.  The ending of this game turned the weak "not-recommended" into a strong "do not buy this game at any price".\n\nFirst, at least if you are playing on a PC, this game has horrible field-of-view.  This is so the game designers can "scare" you by making monsters appear in the 320 degrees that you cannot see.  A lot of the game is swinging the view around to try and figure out where some hellspawn is shanking you with a claw.  That's a jump scare that gets old real quick.\n\nIt's like a lot of other console ports, the gameplay is clunky.  However, in this game, there is zero redeeming story.  It's basically a less-playable DOOM with bad FOV.  Really nice graphics and really neat maps which is what kept me playing until the end, even though it is an unapologetic 100% corridor-shooter.\n\nAnd then the end, which drags on and on.  The game play changes suddenly and you die a lot.  Pretty sure the only reason for this is to show you several types of "fatality" animations for your character.  You'd think this could be interesting but you are so uninvested in the character at this point that it is simply tedious.","September 10, 2015","false","18.8"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

As I finally got the chance to play it, despite having it in my collection for a long while now, I played for around an hour.\n\n\nPROS:\n- The story seems very interesting.\n- Good graphics for its time.\n- Good cinematic scenes.\n\n\nCONS:\n- The camera kills this game. It was nauseating, and the fact that the camera is on the left shoulder of the character makes this game unplayable.\n- Lack of actual ingame options to modify makes this game feel like it's missing a lot of depth.\n- No actual save states - you can only save by going up to a terminal. Uhm... why are there checkpoints instead?\n-  During the first scene where you run, I could not for the life of me understand that you needed to press on a button to fight back a specific enemy (while in the straightjacket). I needed to go on youtube to figure out what I was doing wrong. As I was using my PC keyboard, the onscreen instructions - for some reason - did not properly appear. The fact that they couldn't even get this simple vital thing in the game... you know, onscreen instructions, made me so annoyed as I kept dying ~10 times as I tried figuring out what I was doing wrong. Which happened to be nothing, as it was the game that was improperly designed.","November 8, 2015","false","0.8"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

The statis thing is a bore and seems unneeded. Instead of giving you real world problems you have to do stupid little combos. The first time you encounter the need for this tool is to keep a door from closing due to an electric eye that scans you and makes the door close. You have to use this stacis tool instead of simply shooting out the damn electric eye which would work the same and disable it. Once again you have a dumb ♥♥♥ weapon that will blow the ♥♥♥♥ out of monsters yet cannot damage simple devices in the surroundings. If you are a game nerd and love to have ridiculous restrictions that require a ONE WAY OR THE HIGHWAY mode then this is for you. If you are wanting to play the game as a time killer for kicks to see monsters then go play Doom 3 which this is clearly a rip off of and the graphics are just as Poor! This game is about as much fun as Jericho which was a rolling piece of crap asmuch as this one. For me I like the idea of it yet it has too many restrictions within the realm of physics to work with! One thing I CANNOT STAND about Steam is that unlike prichasing the game where when you find it blows dog ♥♥♥♥ you cannot simply give it to a kid to play that might like this type of limited thinking!

The excellent pacing is gone in favor of shoving cutscenes down your throat every five minutes.\nThe gameplay is faster and more intense, in a system that isn't made for speed. Favoring memorization of enemies that will instakill/bumrush you over any kind of tactics or skill. Jumpscares will now gib you where the first game had the sense not to throw cheap deaths at you that you couldn't avoid.\nZero G doesn't work that way, good night.\n\nThe story contradicts the first game and adds nothing of value. All the way up until the end it is never made clear what is going on and you are left wondering who the villian is and why he is the villian. It fails to understand even simple concepts established in the first game, instead misrepresenting and retconning them as taken at face value.\n\nAdditionally, the Steam version gives you late game stuff for free right off the bat. Making the game far easier than it needs to be.\n\nIf Dead Space is Alien, this game most assuredly is Alien 3, complete with butchering of an earlier Earth invasion storyline that would actually have been good.","January 23, 2014","false","9.3"," 5 of 18 people (28%) found this review helpful","28","5","18","0","0"

At this point it feels as if they're intentionally holding pieces of the story out for other media [Comics or movies] in order to milk more money out of this.\n\nIn a confusing turn, they gave you the ability to buy multiple suits and variatons on weapons, which felt like they artifically padded out the list of useless weapons [Can beat the game fine with just Plasma Cutter, I've done it with both games] and suits so they could use them for a bullet point on the back of the box.\n\ntl;dr - kind of fun to play, completely fails in every way as a horror and/or story driven game.

I was very patient, and played through to chapter 15 (the last chapter)... despite the occasional spike in difficulty or ridiculous QTE sequence, like the blast from the solar array which is basically trial and error.  I developed a reasonable strategy over the preceeding 14 chapters as the difficulty remained generally even.  Then the last chapter arrived, and the difficulty shoots through the roof.  After spending about 2 hours playing the same sequence over and over, my opinion of the game dropped precipitously, mostly because the designers decided to  introduce an arbitrary mechanic to increase difficulty.  I rage quit and will probably not finish it,  I did enjoy the ambience, sound effects, general story, etc... but unfortunately the last chapter ruined it for me.

Creepy, but I wouldn't say it was scarier than the first. They're about the same in scariness. But this one was especially scary for the first parts. Overall, more action, more living people, and more of a focus on Isaac. You also get a bit more explanation of what's going on. Sort of a buzz kill, but it makes up for it with surprises.\n\n\n5/5 stars\n*****","June 5, 2014","true","13.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
