No real story is fleshed out or explained at great length and quite frankly, it doesn't really need any. This is certainly a game that gets by on its charm alone and it does so with a humble air about it.\n\nControls, consisting of a basic three button input scheme, are responsive and allow the right amount of precision needed to succeed (or showcase multiple failures if you become overly anxious). The perfect setup for the type of game Knightmare Tower is, honestly.\n\nThe game's sense of progression comes in the form of a shop accessible at the end of each attempt to ascend the tower. Using available gold earned from previous tries, you're able to upgrade the knight in a number of areas. It's a welcomed touch that definitely helps with certain challenges, although it is entirely possible to finish the game's "story" mode without having fully upgraded each area.\n\nAdditional challenge comes in the form of quests issued as you attempt to reach the top of the tower. Some of these are relatively easy to accomplish with little effort (more so if you factor in the upgrade system) but are otherwise a welcomed distraction. Once you're done with the normal mode, you'll have access to the endless survival mode which also has its own set of quests to complete but also features an upgraded set of monsters to contend with. Like all endless modes, the fun factor available here is only limited to how long you can tolerate it before throwing in the towel.\n\nThe art style is a mix of quirky and cartoon-y, showcasing clean lines and (mostly) vibrant colors in an attempt to remain visually pleasing to the eyes.\n\nThe music, written and performed by Belfast duo HyperDuck SoundWorks, is well suited to the game. It's a synthesized orchestral sound that never becomes overbearing and doesn't feel like an afterthought, which is a considerable plus given that the nature of the game warrants hearing the same piece of music looped repeatedly much of the time.\n\nOverall, there's enough content present in Knightmare Tower to warrant a purchase (especially if you're the type who often buys games on a budget) despite its overall short length.\n\nThe asking price may seem too steep for some (especially those who know the game's origin as a Flash title) but if you're able to get past that potential bias toward it, there's always the possibility of picking it up at a discounted price.","July 12, 2015","true","5.3"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CyanShifter/recommended/298400/","CyanShifter","CyanShifter","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CyanShifter/","504 products in account","This game has been criticized for being a flash game, originaly avaiable for free. While it's true that there is a free of charge flash version, the one avaiable on steam has been completely rebuilt on the Unity engine. Now, moving on to the acttual review.\n\nKnightmare Tower is an arcade style game. You play a night going up the tower to save 10 princesses and ultimately deffeat the boss at the top of the tower. Seem's pretty bland, right? It would be, if not for the way you ascend the tower is by hitting your enemies with your sword. You basicly fly around at the top of the screen, slowly falling dow until you hit an enemy or dashing straight at them so that you can get up again. It's the type of arcade game where you're gonna keep failing until you purchase the right upgrades.\n\nSpeaking of upgrades. While ascending the tower, you will keep finding stuff that'll aid you in you journey. Bombs that'll deliver a hit to each enemy curently on the screen, horn that will spawn odd, non hostile creatures you can wack down to go up higher and gain some gold and, well, bags of gold. The last one is obviously used to purchase the previously mentioned upgrades. Those are chategorized as: Equipment, Upgrades and potions. Upgrading your equipment will make your rocket go higher, make you able to withstand more damage or deliver it or just make your movement more fluid. Upgrades are less noticeble, but they still help you a great deal! Potions are another item you can find, and upgrading it in the store will keep adding effects to it like speed or damage boost.\n\nThe game features a variety of different foes. From the harmless demons you use as fodder for your sword, to weird, centipede-like things that you can only hit in the head. Some ill shoot at you, others will blow fire, some others will just use spikes to protect themselves. You've gotta be carefull and time your dashes just right to nog get hit. Also, it's important to note that if you dash and hit no enemys you will fall of the tower. A rocket will quickly get you back up, but you will lose a great deal of your speed, wich will leave you vulnerable to the biggest foe of them all. Lava. Lava will start following you if you don't ascend the tower fast enough. It doesn't mess around. If you fall into it, game over, no matter how much damage you can withsand.\n\nSo you've gone up the tower, saved all the princesses and and defeated the final boss. What now, you might ask. Well now, you unlock a survival mode. The tower is infinite in height and the monsters more fierce than ever! This is where the "endgame" begins. If you want to squeeze a bit more out of this game, you'll have a lot of fun trying to get into the leaderboards! Now, the monsters in this tower are always the same, and the only thing that changes is their health, spawn rates and the speed of the lava, as you go up the tower. Make no mistake, though, this get's real hard, real quick!\n\nAs for achievements, the game only has 6 of them, wich will propably turn off anyone who look's to bump up their achievement count, but if you're looking for a challenge, you're gonna find it here. Sure, finishing the game and getting everything there is to get in the shop aren't hard achievements, but getting up to 100.00 meters in survival mode? Good luck.\n\nHonestly, I cannot reccomend this game enough. I am having tons of fun with it, and I bet most of you will too. Happy gaming!","July 26, 2014","true","13.4"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

It's really minimalistic in its controls, but the way it's executed makes it an intense game of skill with a little bit of luck.\n\nHere's a quick look video if you want to see gameplay with my impressions of it. If you'd rather read, just continue below for generally the same thing.\n\nhttp://youtu.be/agdKUVMg00o\n\nNow before I begin, I'll say you can play this game for free online with pretty much all of the same content. But since it's good to support the devs, you can play it on steam with a better resolution, smoother gameplay, and a controller, which is very much worth it. It also serves as a good demo to see if you'd like the game. Now with that sorted, let's continue this review.\n\nSo what is this game? It's about a knight flying up a tower off a rocket and his enemies' face. Why does he do it? Because he wants a harem of princess like any good chap.\n\nOkay, maybe the concept is silly. I get that. But great feeling of progression this game gives is fantastic. Every time you fly up the tower, you amass gold for when you die (and you will die) for the next round when you upgrade your stuff. You can upgrade your sword, health, rocket, potions, luck, and plenty more to give you an edge to make your way up the tower just a little bit farther. Every so often as you scale higher up the tower, you'll reach a princess who will give you a bonus powerup/enemy that'll make your life easier in the next runs. And you'll keep this system up as you fly farther than ever before, encountering harder and more challenging enemies the higher you go.\n\nAnd that's pretty much it. But while it's so simple, it's a ton of fun with great replayability. It's doesn't even grindy at all since the game has no problem awarding you with gold so you can get that next powerup. There's even achievements and quests that give you side objectives for even more gold. It's really a great system.\n\nIf I had anything to ding this game for, it's just how short it is. You'll probably beat the main quest after 2-3 hours. But it does give you a survival mode, so you'll have something to do after that.\n\nBut all in all, this is a solid $4 game. Worth every penny. It's mindless fun and a joy to play.","June 16, 2014","true","2.8"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/recommended/298400/","somebody336","somebody336","http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/","2760 products in account","Knightmare Tower is a game in where you embark on a quest to save the King's gorgeous princesses (especially last one) from the top of a tower. That's the whole story but I see no better motivation then that, so anymore would have been meaningless. Anywho, that's about the most sense it will make, since as soon as you enter the tower the only way up is through latching on to a medieval rocket ship and further propelling yourself upwards by slashing enemies. It is a very simple game and the only controls are move and attack. Your only attack is a downwards thrust to attack enemies below you which should not be spammed unless you want to miss the monster and fall. Falling is not the end of the world as the rocket ship will catch you but your momentum will be greatly decreased and with lava rapidly filling up the tower it is something you will want to avoid doing even if it causes you to take a hit. Enemies will also fight back by growing spikes on their back, shooting projectiles at you or fire beams at you.\n\nTaking a hit causes you to lose a heart and starting off you have three. They are regained by random enemy drops and they occurred quite commonly. Common enough that dying by enemies wasn't really much of an issue. Go high enough and you will break through a ceiling which changes the ugly bland background to another color as well as makes enemies tougher and have better attacks. Each ceiling you break will net you a princess that will add something to the game like bombs, rare double health drops and a potion shop. Unfortunately it is impossible to win at first no matter how skilled you are. For one  the top of the tower is locked until you complete every single “quest” which are things like killing a certain amount of enemy without taking damage or just collecting a certain amount of money. Another reason is this game is very much designed for phones so you will have to grind for money to be able to attack harder, move faster and to stand any chance of winning.\n\nThere is no surefire way to gain money, it just drops at random via enemies or you can hit a bubble with a floating black monster inside for massive rewards. You will gain next to nothing at the start though so I suggest immediately upgrading your “Luck” skill for better money pick ups. Another way to gain money is to hit a horn that is unlocked by rescuing a certain princess to summon a harmless enemy that will grant a huge reward if you manage to beat it. They are not difficult, just very damage spongy until you max out your sword to deal more damage. Having an item shop does give you an objective to keep progressing so it doesn't get too repetitive but it doesn't really feel like progress, just a “Oh great, now I can kill an enemy without spamming the attack button a dozen times.”. Without the item shop the game would get boring extremely fast so it is up to the reader's preferences to decide if that is a good thing or not.\n\nEnemy variety is pretty decent. Most of the same enemies you meet at the start will still be there by the end but with a slight visual change and capable of taking a lot more damage. One of the selling points is “over 50 different monsters” but in truth most are the same as the last monster but can take a bit more damage and may fire a few more projectiles late game. It's not really a big deal though. Being able to tell an enemy from the other so you immediately know how they will attack is very important and something you will have no problem with no matter how far up the tower you go. There is an end to the tower and if you have not completed all the “quests” you will crash face first into a locked ceiling and lose immediately. Once you half-heartedly do finish all the quests you will be able to fight a surprisingly epic last boss. It is a dumb “meme” boss but the fight itself is pretty good. Once you beat that boss you will unlock a endless survival mode where you meet tougher enemies and can play until you inevitably die. Survival mode also introduces new quests but there is no real reason to do them unless you are low on cash. Once you get far enough into the tower the enemies get way too bullet spongy to the point of the game no longer being enjoyable.\n\nMusic is alright though a few more tracks would be appreciated it since it felt like I was listening to the same song for the entire game. Graphics are cutesy but you do cut enemies in half and guts come out so it may not be something you would be comfortable letting a child play. The humor is pretty funny from the few cutscenes there are. One small thing I noticed while playing which is neither a good or bad thing is that invincibility frames after getting hit last a very short while so after being hit you will likely get hit again and again unless you move out of the way. In the end of the day this is still a solid little title. I did get a few hours of enjoyment out of it and all the micro-transactions that were likely in it have been removed so once you buy it you get the complete experience. This is a good game to play when you are low on time or just in between breaks from larger games. Recommended to those that don't mind mandatory grinding and are fine with a short but overall enjoyable game.","July 28, 2015","true","4.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

Well worth the price and plenty to have fun with. A king had his princesses kidnapped and you decide you can rescue them and they will fall in love with you. You launch yourself up a tower on top of a rocket and then freefall. The goal is to kill monsters to keep you from falling and they boost you higher up the tower. You will break through ceilings after certain heights reached which will rescue a princess and with that tougher enemies show up to bring more of a challenge. When you rescure a princess she will unlock a bonus for you that may show up when you kill the enemies. Stuff like bombs, health, money, and potions.\n\nAfter each time you end your game you will have money to spend in the store to unlock stuff like health, better damage, and better speed boots for example. When you unlock health and damage it will change the look of your sword and armor. Not much but a cool little feature.\n\nOnce you save the last princess you will need to beat the boss. He's does give a little challenge but nothing to tough. After that you unlock survival mode where you try to climb as high as you can. In this mode enemies are tougher and it can get crazier in battles. Achievements were also pretty easy to unlock if you're into earning those.\n\nOverall I had a good time playing Knightmare Tower and found it well worth it's asking price. I did pretty much beat everything in one sitting and most likely won't play the game anymore but that doesn't take away from it's fun and value.","March 20","true","5.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

With it now on Steam, I feel like I've practically come full circle.\n\nJuicy Beast Studio primarily develop free flash games, with a few ported to mobile devices. Knightmare Tower represents their first title on Steam. Now, before I continue, let me just link you to a post where Juicy Beast explain the differences between the flash version and the Steam version: here.\n\nMuch like the flash version, this one was relatively short to complete. I managed to complete the main game in...I forget...maybe a few hours? It shouldn't take too long to upgrade everything and challenge the boss. Following that, survival mode proved to be a fun, and slightly harder, distraction. Alas, it did feel a bit too short and I finished the main Steam achievements very quickly. I do wish there was more content added to the game.\n\nOh yes, I forgot to talk about gameplay. Silly me. So, there's this knight that uses rockets to ascend a tower and rescue princesses, in order to defeat the boss beyond the ceiling. As he ascends, enemies come to kill him. The knight basically falls down on these enemies to kill them and increase his speed going upwards. If he goes too slow, the lava consumes him.\nYou also gain gold to buy upgrades for your knight, rocket, and etc.. It's imperative that you finish all the upgrades before fighting the boss, which has bullet curtain segments that feels oddly out of place. You don't need to, however. What you DO need to finish are quests (3 maximum per tower run - more are unlocked once you die as the completed quests are removed from the queue) in order to get the key to challenge the boss.\n\nThe game looked and played exactly how I remembered it from my Kongregate days. Oddly enough, while there's now controller support in this game, there's no more mouse support. I'm not fazed by this, however - I use the keyboard.\n\nKnightmare Tower was very fun and very addicting back in my Kongregate days, and the Steam version made me relive those days all over again.\n\nWhen to buy: If you're uncertain of whether you want to buy this game, you can try the free flash version here[www.kongregate.com]. If you'd like to support Juicy Beast and earn some Steam achievements, this game will probably last you about 5 hours and has been discounted 50% in the past (not on Steam). So...your call.\n\nFrom the same developer: Check out their Kongregate profile and portfolio[www.kongregate.com] here.\n\nYou may add me on Kongregate if you wish - click here[www.kongregate.com]. No guarantees I'll add you back since I almost never go there anymore.\n\n8.0/10\n\nLike indie games? Want to see how some games play before deciding whether to buy them? Like game giveaways?

I played it on Kongregate (along with all the other games from Juicybeast, and I loved them all!), and I had no idea it came to Steam. It was on the Summer Sale when I got aware of it. Of course, I clicked immediately.\n\nI first checked if the game gives anything new compared to the flash version. Although it does, finally I decided I don't care, because this is a game that's developers deserved the money.\n\nI really liked all of the new features, I think the combo is a much better idea than that multiplier-anything in the flash version. The new textures for the potions are great (for example, a feather in the potion for the Levitate effect), too.\n\nI found it harder to defeat the boss (which is hilarious) in this game. A lot, actually. But I say it is good, because when I played the flash game, I mostly ended up with the game being beaten and I'm only 60% or so maxed. Now it is a real challenge.\n\nI didn't think that the game has a story, but now I see it does, and man, I laughed so hard at the ending!\n\nThere are one thing which I badly miss from the game, and that is mouse control. And I also have a suggestion: if you could divide up the monster's healthbars somehow so we know how many hits do they take, well that would be great.\n\nI give it 9/10, could EASILY be 10/10 if it had the 2 features I listed one paragraph above.

(ps, knight on a gameboy, nice touch. :3) the graphics are ranging, to adorable, (i.e. the knight, the bat spitting fireballs.) to pants ♥♥♥♥-rocketing disturbing. (i.e. the cartoony wyrms where you have to hit ONLY the head. and the winged mobs that protrude spikes out of their forehead) also the boss is a rage face. 10/10 if you didnt buy this game, get it NAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW!!! its on sale, it lasts for 11 minutes and 24 hours.","June 22, 2014","true","3.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I played the flash version and it displayed an addictive mannerism that these games have, but this one was different. It is a nice little time waster but above all it won't waste your money in the slightest. They have now made it so that you can now play with an Xbox 360 controller which is smooth and responds well. Only problem with the keys is that they are different than the flash (now WASD instead of mouse to hit and move) which makes them a little bit harder to manouver in a game such as this. They have also made gold a little harder to obtain which is pretty neat.\n\nDon't be hesitant towards buying this game as you will not regret the purchase. I assure you that.

I played it on Kongregate (along with all the other games from Juicybeast, and I loved them all!), and I had no idea it came to Steam. It was on the Summer Sale when I got aware of it. Of course, I clicked immediately.\n\nI first checked if the game gives anything new compared to the flash version. Although it does, finally I decided I don't care, because this is a game that's developers deserved the money.\n\nI really liked all of the new features, I think the combo is a much better idea than that multiplier-anything in the flash version. The new textures for the potions are great (for example, a feather in the potion for the Levitate effect), too.\n\nI found it harder to defeat the boss (which is hilarious) in this game. A lot, actually. But I say it is good, because when I played the flash game, I mostly ended up with the game being beaten and I'm only 60% or so maxed. Now it is a real challenge.\n\nI didn't think that the game has a story, but now I see it does, and man, I laughed so hard at the ending!\n\nThere are one thing which I badly miss from the game, and that is mouse control. And I also have a suggestion: if you could divide up the monster's healthbars somehow so we know how many hits do they take, well that would be great.\n\nI give it 9/10, could EASILY be 10/10 if it had the 2 features I listed one paragraph above.

It's not bad, but it's thoroughly "meh".\n\nJust port the Burrito Bison games to Steam already, I'd buy the hell out of those.","July 8, 2014","false","0.9"," 1 of 7 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","1","7","0","0"

However, compared to the Kongregate version, this steam version's boss is too hard. It is kind of imbalanced because of the cannons which shoot the glowing purple balls. Some players cant even dodge it. And the "hearts" aren't enough to get player a close call. It's either they can make it or not.\n\nAnyway I am just commenting. It will be just too hard for some people that's all. Which results them in getting stuck at the boss level forever. Even though they manage to dodge the normal cannons and spikes.","June 21, 2014","false","3.9"," 2 of 13 people (15%) found this review helpful","15","2","13","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/macheti/recommended/298400/","macheti","Macheti","http://steamcommunity.com/id/macheti/","547 products in account","An extremely addicting arcade game made by Juicy Beast Studios, one of the best (in my opinion) indie game developers out there.\n\nThe first thing that caught my eye was the art style, which itself has a slick, smooth, cartoon-y look to it that reminds me of games such as Castle Crashers, the art in which I also find amazing. All the monsters in the game slowly evolve depending on how far up the tower you go, and their models gradually become more sinister but also more detailed.\n\nThe gameplay is very much reminiscent of Burrito Bison (another game I enjoyed a lot but unfortunately is a flash game and not on Steam at the moment), mainly because it was also made by Juicy Beast. It shares similar game mechanics, where you make your way from a point A to point B while defeating enemies and collecting money. You then use this money to upgrade your equipment and thus can get further in the game, and collect more money and repeat. The main twist on this formula however is that in this game you travel up instead of to the right.\n\nThe amount of content in this game is very surprising, as it is a decent price and does not look like much. However, the wealth of interesting upgrades and unique quests will occupy you for hours. The enemies progressively get harder and more plentiful, the death lava at the bottom of the screen rises faster, and the game generally keeps you on edge and stays challenging. There is even a boss fight included in the game.\n\nYou will feel very satisfied when you finally purchase that last upgrade or get to a floor you've been struggling to get to for a while. In the end, in order to 100% complete the game and get all achievements, you will have to master the Survival mode, which is infinite and will test your skill immensely.\n\nOverall, a refreshing and unique take on this area of arcade games and I am definitely looking forward to more games from Juicy Beast, and maybe even Burrito Bison on Steam? :D\n\n9.5/10\n\n","May 30, 2015","true","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Check out our video review here! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf9iAqAgX8I\n\nThe popular flash game now has a full release on Steam. Knightmare Tower is a simple concept that is executed with little flaw. It's a game that boasts accessibility, but can still be challenging to experienced gamers. So brandish your blade and fuel up the rocket, we don't want anyone falling down the tower.\n\nKnightmare starts with a simple story; ten princesses have been kidnapped and need rescuing from a tower. The tower is in control of... let's just call him Boss, and his monsters and minions will do anything to keep you from reaching the damsels.\n\nThe gameplay however is quite unique; You are launched from a rocket and propelled into the air. Monsters approach from beneath to attack you, to which you can perform a downward slash with your sword. Slashing enemies propels you further into the air, with the idea of gaining higher speeds and maintaining momentum. Without hitting enemies you will eventually lose momentum and fall in to the quicly approaching lava, causing your run to end. Monsters can also end your run by attacking you and depleting your health. Forcing you to attack monsters as soon as they appear, as opposed to letting them act first. This adds a madness to runs as there can be tens of monsters chasing you up the tower at once. Bouncing off their heads becomes very satisfying and fun.\n\nKnightmare Tower is a roguetype, meaning its broken into runs and after each run you have the chance to spend your loot on upgrades. Such as: better armor that increase your health bar, a better sword that deals more damage to difficult enemies, and potions that can be found during your runs and improve your character in some way for a short  time. This means many runs are needed before having the necessary equipment to take on the boss. There are also quests that can be completed on each run. You have multiple attempts at the same three quests, adding more challenge for players who want it. After each quest is completed, you are rewarded with gold, and a new quest takes it's place. There are dozens of quests in the game to complete, but none feel out of the reach of experienced players.\n\nReaching certain points in a run, will let you break a ceiling, and pass through to the next section of the tower. Higher sections of the castle have slightly more difficult enemies than the lower sections, but become much easier with upgraded tools. Additionaly each ceiling you brake through rescues another princess; who has a special power attached to her. These powers show up in bubbles during runs. When attacked these powers activate and can have varying effects. Some just deal massive damage to enemies on screen, while others summon mini bosses. This changes up the gameplay and helps it feel fresh, even after a few hours in.\n\nThe main game isn't very long, but you would be leaving a lot behind to stop after rescuing the princesses and defeating the boss. You probably won't have all of the gear upgrades, and a survival mode is unlocked after beating the story, with all new quests. There is easily another couple of hours after the main story of things to complete, and many of the Steam achievments demand more playtime. The replayability of this game adequite, and the games design is fun enough that completing a story is somewhat in the back of the gamer's head anyway. This game is just fun to throw on and play.\n\nKnightmare Tower has tight controls, a fluent artstyle, and an addictive gameplay. For under five dollars this is a no brainer game for anyones library. You will be hacking a slashing monster for hours without slashing your bank account. If you played the flash version, or are new to the franchise, you will not be disapointed.\n\n8.0\n","June 29, 2015","true","6.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Of course upgrades for higher level requires much more money, but as you upgrade things that won't feel too long or bored to grind the amount of money. The length of each floor in this game is calculated everytime you play so you won't feel bored to pass previous levels you've beaten before.

You "level up"/"gear up" your knight in the shop with money earned and picked up during gameplay, which helps make the game more compelling.\nHowever, it's pretty simplistic but in a way that suits the game decently.\nSince there's only one type of weapon and all enemy attacks (those who have it) deal the same amount of damage, there is no reason for a more "complex gearing/leveling system".\n\nWhich brings me to the pricetag. I only bought it because I was looking at some brief fun but most importantly: I had a 66% off coupon.\nI would NEVER consider a game like this (without trading cards) with a pricetag like this when you're done with it after ~5 hours.\nIt may sound harsh, but the reality is I'm not sure if I'm ever going to play the game again after completing it.\nAtleast the developer put in a "Start new game" feature which might help in replay-ability.\n\nWhich again brings me to my next point.. as others have already stated, you're not able to rebind the controls.\nYou'll quickly learn them however, and I only found it frustrating once I broke "zeh purhfect g4m3".\nYou're able to pause the game with Esc - However, if you want to resume, you have to press space.\nIf you press esc it restarts, and if you press enter you'll enter the shop (or vice versa - Sue me, I can't remember haha).\n\nOverall the game did its trick - I ultimately had fun with it.\nIf you like casual games, with simplistic gameplay and "level up system" this might rock your boat.\nThe graphics and animations, in my opinion, are great.\nThe sound/music is also awesome, however there's a slight audio glitch with the final potion making overlap noises if you stack them.\nThe game doesn't crash or anything, it just sounds weird when the second potion is about to wear out).","May 7","true","5.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
