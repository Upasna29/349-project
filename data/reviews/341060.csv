"http://steamcommunity.com/id/spiritreviews/recommended/341060/","spiritreviews","Spirit","http://steamcommunity.com/id/spiritreviews/","732 products in account","Full disclosure: review copy provided by developer/publisher!\n\nAccording to its Steam description, The Lady is a 2D surreal horror puzzle title. After spending time with the game, I would have to disagree, finding its theme to be something more along the lines of a food poisoning-induced cruise ship nightmare simulator (after binging on every episode of Salad Fingers on a tumultuous sea). And much like a food poisoning-induced cruise ship nightmare, it isn't all that fun. Sure, you can muster your strength and start heading towards the casino, but you'll just end up hanging over the railing and releasing cocktail shrimps back into their natural habitat.\n\nLet me start by addressing everything this game does right. The soundtrack is excellent, evoking a sense of otherworldly, uncertain dread; its harsh tones insist that you never let your guard down. This aspect worked for me, although it certainly won't be everyone's cup of tea. I also loved the hand drawn depiction of the actual Lady. She's bizarre and a little scary, yet she manages to become a sympathetic character (which reads like my Match.com profile). There is a particular sadness about her that is skilfully expressed without dialogue or exposition. Unfortunately, this is where my praise ends.\n\nPlaying as the Lady, you shuffle across a 2D plane that is frequently absent of any other visuals besides falling shards of glass, rose petals drifting from the sky, or scissors floating menacingly above. The backdrop is usually just a flat colour framed in shattered glass. The Lady's abode just isn't all that engaging a place.\n\nGameplay amounts to firing projections of your head up and side to side, entering door-like static tears in reality, and the aforementioned shuffling (you'll shuffle a lot). There are puzzles to solve, but they are generally a bit on the obtuse side, which is unfortunate as they are the game's primary focus. Let me present an example, and those sensitive to spoilers can skip ahead to the next paragraph. At one point in your hallucinogenic journey, you'll be halted by some hairy barbed wire-looking stuff. I shuffled back in the other direction, only to be cornered by another hairy barbed wire. I stood, walled in, firing projections of my own head at either side, which proceeded to ping-pong back and forth, damaging me. Finally, frustrated, I just walked into the barbed wire – only to discover that's the “solution.” Just walk through the barrier. It hurts you, but you push through. This is obviously meant to be symbolic or something, but I just found it goofy and counter-intuitive.\n\nThe game also throws up boss fights, although calling them fights is a bit of an overstatement. You fire at them and dodge a single attack or two, rinse and repeat. Then they die and you move on, which made these encounters feel like empty filler. It also doesn't help when half of the designs are just depictions of the seminal Lady (again, maybe it's symbolic, but it just came off as lazy). And as far as the horror element goes? I never found myself frightened. Nor was I anxious, perturbed, nervous, on edge, worried, or concerned. I did feel a sense of monotonous drain after dying at certain confusing points and having to restart the whole damn thing over again. I did feel bored with the same assets being used over and over in a starkly empty world. I did feel relief when the game, faced with exiting, asked if I could go on or not.\n\nNo, I cannot go on, The Lady. You make me sad, and for all the wrong reasons. You make me sad for what might have been, given a little more time in the creative oven, much like my dozens of failed soufflés sitting on the kitchen counter. People will surely appreciate the time and effort I put into my soufflés, but they won't be winning any blue ribbons.","January 29, 2015","false","2.1"," 315 of 351 people (90%) found this review helpful 117 people found this review funny","90","315","351","117","16"

The "deep" meaning trying to be portrayed is an outright joke, because there isn't one (that's the joke I guess? you got us mprart). Nothing was even attempted to be explained either, honestly it came off as pretentious. Now I know why, and I'm not at all surprised.\n\nThe "try to keep going" or "♥♥♥♥ it" when quitting was the icing on the cake though as far as the so called deep meaning goes. That was priceless, and honestly my favorite part of the game humor wise.\n\nI'm only baring a stark attitude because I've seen a few accounts of the creators attitude towards honest criticism and what I've seen is how to not take it properly. Secondly, I honestly feel like you put no effort into this game at all outside of the artwork. There is no content, there are hundreds of browser based games that are much more complex in the gameplay department.\n\nI remember back when I was learning how to code in Java, the very first thing I did was enable my smiley face sprite to move from side to side. I guess I was already half way there to making a fully functional game as all I had to do then was try to (poorly) add some deep emotional reasoning behind the madness, a bit of artwork, and slap a price tag on it.\n\nI'm sorry but that's all this game is, a total of what, 10 sprites moving from side to side and top to bottom? I just can't recommend buying this at any price, it's simply a waste of money.","February 26, 2015","false","0.1"," 92 of 109 people (84%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","84","92","109","8","13"

If you repeat this enough the world around the character eventually changes and introduces more hazards or a boss, for a clunky boss fight.\n\nMy cut-off for games is around the half hour mark: if you can't engage me in 30 minutes, you likely never will. But I was tired of this game within 10. Still, I kept going in an attempt to see if it earns its Mostly Positive rating. But the game never seemed to actually want to begin being good.\nIts harsh difficulty rating doesn't help either. Let me clarify: the game is simple as you basically only slowly move from left to right, but because the controls are so slow everything seems to be on a delay, causing you to get hit by whatever obstacle you were trying to avoid. And after just a few hits it's game over, man.\nMaybe the later levels are great, but since I can't even get past the first two without either dying (and the game closing on me) or me WANTING to shut the game off, I can't comment on them.","May 5, 2015","false","0.9"," 37 of 42 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","37","42","0","4"

I never understood what to do, apart to avoid the falling glass shards, which is not always easy. It seemed to be a game that puts you in the head of someone that is perhaps suffering from a mental breakdown but I don't know.\n\nWhat is particular with the lady is the graphics, that are looking like a drawing on a paper.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aphexplague/recommended/341060/","aphexplague","Genji's sweet ass (Pesuto)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aphexplague/","393 products in account","I originally supported this game on Greenlight, becoming interested in the artstyle and vagueness of the game.\n\nAnd it seems like it succeeded in catching my attention, atleast enough for me to buy.\n\nIs it worth it?\n\nNo.\n\nAnyway, it tries to be all mysterious and interesting, but it's a case of "doing it for the art" to the point that the game just isn't enjoyable as a /game/.\n\nThe art looks good, and The Lady's design is re-used quite nicely. The game's vagueness makes it a bit of a crapshoot to figure things out, and while it advertises that it doesn't hold your hand, it doesn't do it like Dark Souls or other survival horror games that it compares itself to. It does it pretty bad.\n\nI'll admit, it's nice to figure things out through trial and error, but... when you have to go through 4 rooms which unlock the boss, then fight the boss for an unknown amount of time, possibly fail, and re-do the rooms prior to the boss, again, it takes the big issue about survival horror games: Restarting all over again, which removes anything remotely interesting about the game as a whole, and makes it a frustrating experience overall. Oh and compared to other survival horror games, you won't know whether or not you'll be at full health or not, besides the vague "bleeding out from your arm stumps", which... doesn't really show anything.\n\nCons:\n- No way to gauge your health; You won't know whether or not the next hit will kill you. The "bleed" mechanic is pretty poorly implemented.\n- Difficulty is "brutal". About as hard as moving left and right.\n- It's hard to know what is your hitbox and what isn't. At first your head is the only thing, next it's your whole body.\n- The re-used assets become a big joke, especially during the final part of the game, where it becomes a Shoot 'Em Up.\n- No checkpoints, which is apparently part of the whole "brutal old school feel". As mentioned above, it just makes the game tedious and removes any immersion gained up until you've restarted more than twice.\n- It has Steam trading cards, cause why not? (Seriously, does every single game need these things?)\n- Game wants you to learn about yourself, apparently?\n-  apparently the game is about depression. Which is probably the most hipster thing you can drop into an indie game. In no way, did I feel like it was about that at all... And I've had depression. I guess I'm not "indie" enough to feel that way. Oh and the ending ends with the Lady getting her arm ripped off by a bird, which I guess is why she was depressed and the reason why the whole game happened at all?\n\n\nPros:\n- Unique artstyle.\n- Has a nice surreal vague feel to it.\n- The game wants you to learn everything through experimentation.\n- It gives an amazing feel of dread... up until you have to go through it all over again.\n\nSo... overall, it's a pretty disappointing game. I didn't expect much, besides a unique surreal game, and it held that promise high up and then dropped it after it stepped on its own hipster scarf. It could be a good game, but I doubt the creator will make any updates or patches to make this game more favorable to play. So far, all updates for this game have been about his new upcoming game.\nThe game could've been such a great surreal nightmare, but it's plagued by nightmarish game mechanics and things that even traditional throwback games abandoned for the better.\n\nNote: I ended up watching the last few levels of the game, as I got too fed up with dealing with the game.","June 25, 2015","false","0.2"," 25 of 30 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","25","30","0","3"

Hard as f*ck. (Actually, two sentences).\nI must say that it's weird to make a review of this kind of game because... the game's mechanics are really simple, making you wonder if it is a game in itself.\nThis isn't an horror game per se, but it is a kind of horror game. It seems contradictory, but it's not. There is a lot of different ''horror'' games, and this is one of them.\n\nLet me explain: It's not... scary... it's spooky/freaky. Let me explain: This game is rich in visual and emotions. It makes you feel strange inside, and it breaks the fourth wall. The horror comes from your own emotions. The horror, is the weirdness that this game try to make you feel, and it succeeds, in my own opinion. There are levels in which you think that it's never going to end, or that you might never succeed. No matter how hard you try, you still feel helpless. The character is (You are) slow, the attacks are slow, so the ''freaky'' factor comes from the way you move. You are nothing in a ''fast'' moving world.\nThe spooky factor comes from the atmosphere. The sounds are weird. The footsteps sounds are heavy, like if you had the burden of the world on you. Multiple noises comes from everywhere. And you ask yourself: ''What's the point?'' ''where do I go?'' ''What's the purpose of everything'' ''It seems so random''. This game is hard.\nAnd when you wanna quit the game, you have one sentence saying: ''I can't go on like this... I give up.....''.\n\nIt think that this game's about depression, and how life can be hard for some. I'll try to make a full deep review of this game on youtube in French, and also in English and cover it from front to back. It deserve some praise because I think that this ''game'' is more a work of ''Art'' than an ''entertainment''. (Don't get me wrong, Art is a large word, but in this case, it is used to express ''a form of work that makes you feel diferrent emotions''). So I do recommend this experience, because it is a real ''charm' in it's genre.\n\nSome will find this game frustrating... and yes it is. The NEGATIVE thing I have to say about it is that, sometime, (and it seems random) you have to start the game all over again. I am really disapointed in this, because I want to know more about it and my skills are really low in the 3rd (or 4th... not sure) and i am unable to fully get the whole narrative.\n\nOne of my friend bought me this game, because he wanted me to play and analyse it. And I will do a full coverage on it for sure! I am happy that some games are more than ''just a piece to entertain a mass''. The puzzles are weird, as they are not puzzles like ''Zelda'' or ''Myst'' or whatever other mainstream ''puzzle'' game (Don't get me wrong here, I appreciate mainstream games also). Pricing is also good. There are piece of s**t selling for 20-35$, and this game is less than 5$ for one of those experiences.","April 7, 2015","true","1.7"," 51 of 79 people (65%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","65","51","79","4","6"

This game boasts eerie artwork with a mysterious atmosphere. That is until you play it. And die. And then play the same awfully slow part again.\nThis game's as eldritch to play as it looks. The controls are often unresponsive and there seems to be no indication to how many hits you can take before you have to restart; at times the lady can tank several pieces of glass and other times she dies in one hit. Some levels are solved by walking slowly, and then going slowly in the other direction.\nThe pacing is horrible, often the player is forced to dwell in one level for far too long while having figured out the solution long ago.\nI really liked the premise of this as well as it's art and atmosphere.

But The Lady isn't even that, it's...erm...♥♥♥♥ me, I don't know what it is.  An excuse for someone to show off their admittedly intriguing visual style?  An exercise in MASOCHISM, perhaps?!\n\nHmmm, let's see what the Store page has to say about the game.  "A 2D Surreal Puzzle Horror", apparently.  Hmmm, okay.  Surreal...certainly.  Horror...hmmm, maybe at a pinch (it's definitely "disturbing", I'll give it that).  2D...well, yes, by all means.  PUZZLE?!  Well, sure...if a super-primitive, mega-minimalistic, barely-responsive variation of GALAGA is your idea of a "puzzle" game, then I guess it might be that, too!!\n\nThe greatest "puzzle" herein is quite what the dev or devs of this game were high on when they made this highly - ahem - "trippy" product, and one can only hope that no pregnant actresses were murdered or any slogans were written in blood on any walls, but I fear the creative process this time around may have been a messy one.  My guess is that Terry Gilliam had a daughter, who was ♥♥♥♥♥ by Communion aliens, and against her father's best wishes became a video game designer in her mid-teens as a way to avoid falling asleep, lest the black-eyed demons come for her again.\n\nAbsolute ♥♥♥♥ing madness.

The gameplay on the other hand is more akin to trying to open a series of locked doors until you find the one that opens, leading to a second series of doors. And then a third. There's also shooting from time to time. It's not a matter of difficulty so much as it is patience.\n\nTo illustrate this, here's a summary of what I played of the first couple of levels. Starting in a long corridor I headed all the way left, then all the way right, met with identical animations at each end. Assuming those were just the boundaries, it took a good while before I found that you just have to head all the way left again to trigger a different animation and cause the doors to appear. Next I found myself trapped between two barricades that hurt to touch, so I waited, smashing falling glass until eventually my own rebounding projectiles killed me. It turns out you have to just shuffle through all (four, as it turns out) of these barricades, taking damage from each one, before you can proceed to the boss room by going (you guessed it) all the way left, then right, then left again. Did the boss really need me to play with a handicap to my HP in order to pose a challenge? No, as it turns out, since the unresponsiveness of the controls and ill-defined hitboxes did me in several times, along with the lack of brief invincibility after getting hit which meant the boss could bat me away directly into falling glass for a second hit of damage.\n\nEventually I beat it, leading to a maze level where each wrong door looped you back round to the start. This is where my "picking doors until you find the right one" metaphor becomes literal, but the problem is there's no indication as to which to pick of your (up to 5 or so) options, and it's entirely possible you just have to go through every last door before the final one becomes the 'right' one. Again, there's no way to tell other than "keep wandering until something changes". This eventually leads to the next boss, who is a Space Invader complete with 8-bit sounds and Galaga-style projectiles. I'm not sure what this was meant to "symbolize" (if anything) but it scrunches the mood the game was trying to convey up into a ball and tosses it neatly into one of those bins with a basketball hoop over it.\n\nIt was somewhere in the following level that, for the second time, one of my many deaths (there's no 'lives' counter) caused the game to quit out on me. I'm honestly not sure if it even WAS a game-over I triggered or the game glitching out, as the effect was the same - the graphics flicker, the sprites bug out of place then the game freezes and crashes to desktop. And no, of course it doesn't save your progress. Back to the very beginning you go. Faced with redoing all those levels at the same glacially slow pace again, I gave up. That's not, as the storepage description puts it, 'Nintendo Hard', that's a game deliberately trying to waste your time.\n\nHonestly I'm giving this a "cautious non-recommendation" in the end. This honestly shows some promise, and you can get both the game and soundtrack for about £3 like I did, which isn't a steep entry price but this may have been more at home on Newgrounds or Kongregate as a free 'proof of concept'. If it had rethought a few of the gameplay design decisions, and had more ways to proceed than 'wander back and forth' and some means to skip levels you've already beaten this could have been a real gem, or at least less player-hostile.","June 17, 2015","false","1.1"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","1"

In some ways, it throws back to the games of yore, throwing you right into the thick of things without explaining much of anything, and leaving you to figure things out. It also eventually finds its way to vertical shooter "boss" battles, to that effect. Its eerie art style and unique soundtrack seem specifically designed to put the player on edge, which works well enough.\n\nComplaints about the gameplay seem to abound, but while figuring out the timing for certain things takes a certain amount of trial and error, it wasn't overly frustrating. Margin of error was also pretty narrow for some of the combat, but once I recognized the patterns you need to watch out for, it was less frustrating.\n\nThe game's narrative seems rather thin and/or muddled, but in some respects, I rather liked that aspect of it. Rather than laying down a clear story, The Lady leaves more than enough room for the player's imagination to run with things. My main takeaway is that the titular Lady was struggling with some personal issue; whether it's body image, her past, depression, or whatever else is up to you. To be fair, she could also have some issue with other women. Like I said, a lot of room to think about things, since nothing's all that clearly laid out.\n\nWhen all's said and done, The Lady isn't exactly something that's going to change your world, but it was fun enough, and definitely found a little nook in my mind to occupy after I was done, making me wonder what things were all about. I'd say give it a chance.","January 9","true","1.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

While it doesn't treat these subjects from a general point of view, this approach gives a sense of authencity.\n\nGameplay wise, The Lady is comprised of several minimalistically-designed levels, divided in stages. Each level has a different gameplay approach, with a distinct variation for each stage, some being more traditional, while some being more explorative; the exploration parts focus more on the feeling the player has in regards to what is happening to the lady, and not necessarily to the levels themselves.\n\nI would suggest to take the game slowly, since rushing into the stages can get you killed and you have to restart from the beginning of the level (but I decided to treat this as a "story-telling" device); furthermore, the game is short enough to finish in roughly 1h - 1h30.\n\nVisually, the game is simplistic and repetitive, but it manages to get the message across perfectly, and the art style is exquisite. At times it reminded me of Alice: Madness Returns, as if it were a collection of mini-game out of that universe. I appreciated the atmosphere and while I'm not a fan of dark ambient or noise, I belive the sound design fits the game perfectly; some of the sound effects could have used some more work, but now I'm just nitpicking.\n\nOverall I enjoyed the game and its superb artstyle, and consider it to be a fresh breeze of originality.\n\nPros:\n\n* art style\n* atmosphere\n* music and sound design\n* gameplay\n* originality\n\nCons:\n\n* some sound effects\n\nScore: 7.75 / 10","February 14, 2015","true","1.4"," 13 of 30 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","13","30","0","1"

The entire time the sound effects soundtrack to the original Psycho movie creeps through in startles and scares.

When first taking a look at the trailer, the feel of it began to take form into something I wanted to experience for myself.\n\nThe art is utterly gorgeous, and I seriously would not be able to praise it enough. I appreciate games with hand drawn art 10 times more than I normally would. It's got such a creepy and artistic look to it.\n\nThe basic outline of the game is defined and left up to personal interpritation within the slight border lines of what the designers window out, panic attacks and anxiety. The theme and sensation of the game falls into place really nicely and the eereeily abrasive soundtrack puts your mind in that 'panic' feeling, the rules of it break 'normal' and 'proper' game design in a good way that supports the theme. Now, speaking as someone who suffers from severe panic and anxiety attacks, this is played out perfectly.\n\nWith the general theme of the game being one that isn't touched upon very often, if at all, it was a great choice.\nWhere part of me immensely dislikes the 'no-save, no-continue' side of things, it is that awful during a panic attack, you are unable to leave it or be dumped into the middle of one, you just always start from the beginning, so it's only realistic that the theme and atmosphere of the game keeps that key element.\n\nA couple of things I didn't like is the attitude and attempt to be ''Brutal, like the old days of gaming!'', as it completely ignores two things, ''the old days'' that people remember so fondly, mostly consisted of teaching the player through the gameplay, even within the first few moments, they used to do this.. And secondly, the older games weren't made about these touchy subjects, they were made to be fun, some uplifting with good story and mostly to get as many quarters out of you as possible.\n\nNow, in The Lady, there is a part of the game where you have to not go into the first ''doorway'' and wait around for the next. Unless you up-front were told that sometimes the first doorway isn't the right one, even if it's the only one visible at the time, without looking it up, it would be just about impossible unless by sheer fluke to have figured this out. That is not good gameplay and this is by no means to be considered exploration.\n\nLastly, one thing I really did dislike was how it worked so hard and put so much effort into getting you into this creepy, panicked theme to then have it's random 'space-invaders' like levels with completely out of place sound effects, break the atmosphere that it spent so long carefully setting up. It also drops it's 'unforgiving' nature during these as when you die, you can restart from that point up until you have no more lives.\n\nIn short, through an art perspective, it is amazing. As a game, the immense and deliberate mess makes it hard to progress in  the most punishing way possible, not a challenging way, or in a way that engages with the theme and that is never a good thing.\n\nHowever, overall is was an enjoyable experience and had great room for interpretation which was set up nicely and it's also a well displayed out way of what a panic disorder is really like. You and your mind is the worst enemy.\n\n\n\n","February 3, 2015","true","1.7"," 10 of 29 people (34%) found this review helpful","34","10","29","0","6"

Don't take anything for granted because things aren't always as they seem.\n\nAudio: 10/10\nI can't say enough how important it is for audio in a game to completly immerse yourself. This game does that perfectly. The audio in this game was ment to pull you in and feel what the character is feeling. To actually feel the anxiety, to become 'The Lady' at certain parts of the game. Well done.\n\nGameplay: 6/10\nIt's a simple side scroller with very few controls but the controls to seem a little klunky or non-responsive at times. Once you find out what everything is in the game, you then know what you need to do to progress. The puzzles are difficult. You will find yourself repeating yourself over and over again wondering "there is no way out" only to find that you were doing it wrong all along. You actually have to do everything possible until you find out what to do. The game is very short. But if you cant figure out the puzzles, then it's quite possibly a 70 hour game.\n\nOverall: 6/10\nIf you are looking for something to play for a few hours or want a quick game to beat, I recomend this game for everyone to play. The price is resonable to try out something new. It's purely a form of art.","January 29, 2015","true","1.7"," 21 of 53 people (40%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","40","21","53","2","2"
