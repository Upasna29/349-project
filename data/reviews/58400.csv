"http://steamcommunity.com/id/animusfurandi/recommended/58400/","animusfurandi","Animus Furandi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/animusfurandi/","1585 products in account","Turba takes the enticing idea of a Bejeweled-style game that utilizes your music library and screws it all up by incorporating features that don't work as they should, resulting in a nearly unplayable mess. The simple task of matching three or more blocks of the same color is complicated by "bomb" blocks, which are blocks that will cause a 3x3 set of blocks to turn gray if they aren't matched within a certain number of beats. Adding to this problem is the brainless design decision that your board fills up with blocks with each beat of the song. This ensures that fast songs are literally unbeatable on certain play modes, even without the addition of bomb blocks. Worse yet, the game does not accurately detect beats, so blocks appear at completely random intervals. Finally, cheaters have devised a way to obtain the top scores on literally every song, so forget about ranking in the top 3 on anything, no matter how obscure it is. I've spoken with one of the devs (They have another terrible-looking game on Greenlight), and he sees nothing wrong with the game and has no plans to support it any further. This game is a horrendous waste of money at any price.","December 20, 2013","false","4.2"," 79 of 84 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","79","84","0","0"

This fad gave us many classic games such as Beat Hazard and Audiosurf, and continues strong to this day with games like Melody's Escape and Drive Any Track. It's personally one of my favorite types of game. Unfortunately, it also gave us some real stinkers like Ugly Baby and Turba.\n\nTurba is supposed to be a rhythm-based match-3 game, but it's so ill-conceived and badly-designed on so many levels that it’s almost a work of art. The basis of the game is that you’re supposed to select groups of same-colored blocks, then right-click to clear them to the rhythm of the music. You get more points for using multiplier blocks, for keeping the rhythm, and for selecting one group of each color before clearing them at once. There are three game modes which determine how the tiles will appear: Free mode will give you a Bejeweled-style wall of blocks, Descend mode makes the tiles slowly push from the top of the screen like Tetris Attack, and Ascend mode makes tiles gradually appear on top of other tiles. To help you control the board, you’re also given a choice of a rechargeable special power, which ranges from generating wildcard blocks to shooting blocks with a laser. The special powers gradually unlock and grow stronger the more you play.\n\nThe game concepts are all horrible, not just in practice but also in theory. For starters, the core game mechanic of dragging paths through colored groups is a terrible idea. Depending on what mode you play, the whole board is gradually moving, and punishment tiles are decaying and causing the board to collapse. In other words, the game consists of dragging paths through blocks which are always unexpectedly shifting or falling from underneath your mouse cursor. Imagine trying to draw pixel art in Microsoft Paint as the window will randomly jerk around, and you can get an idea of how it feels like to play Turba. I think the idea was that you’re supposed to carefully select tiles between beats of the music, but it’s ruined thanks to the beat detection.\n\nBeat detection is downright unreliable. The game’s registration of beats seems mostly random except on the most specific types of songs, so it’s completely up to luck whether or not clicking on a drumbeat of the song will break your combo or keep it going. To get reasonable scores, I had to find a (very) small handful of songs in my library where the beat detection actually worked and stick to those.\n\nThen you have to deal with the bombs. You cannot even rock out to your own music, because the game will constantly spawn time bombs which beep obnoxiously like 90’s-era digital alarm clocks. They spawn on random tiles which must be cleared before they blow up into a 3x3 square of punishment blocks. On the higher difficulties it’s nearly impossible to get rid of them, because they’ll just keep spawning, and often land in places that are unreachable anyway. Defending against bombs is not interesting and not fun, not to mention that it ruins the music, and I don’t see how anyone thought it was a good idea.\n\nThe menus are so badly-designed that they must be seen to be believed. They’re filled with pointless, lethargic menu animations that sometimes take up to five seconds for buttons to slide into place or fade in. The selection box around items is a soft glow which is so hard to see that it might as well not be there. The menu music has some of the most depressing, boring tracks I have ever heard. Whereas games like Audiosurf punch you in the face with electronica the minute you hit the title screen and get you pumped to play the game, Turba’s “song select” menu music will forever be burned into my mind as the official theme song for watching paint dry.\n\nI’ve hunted for the achievements and tried to master the gameplay, and I feel like I gave Turba an honest chance at capturing my heart, but it never even come close. The gameplay is just aggravating, obtuse, and unrewarding. The minor satisfaction I got from holding a long beat streak was destroyed by unreliable beat detection breaking my combos, the massive frustration of trying to paint selection areas as the board is constantly falling and shifting, and that constant beeping of the time bombs over the music that never seems to go away.\n\nBleh. Awful.","September 21, 2015","false","9.3"," 15 of 15 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","15","15","2","0"

Turba sounded really neat when I first saw it. I was itching to try it out. However, I was sadly disappointed.\n\nThe #1 thing that destroys this game is its abysmal beat detection. Because the rhythm of the song determines how fast the blocks spawn/move and allows you to get "beat bonuses" for clearing blocks to the beat of the song, it's a key component of the game. Unfortunately, the game often skips beats and detects beats when there are none, completely disrupting the flow of play.\n\nA few of the other game mechanics seem a bit off as well. "Beat blocks" are supposed to turn all surrounding blocks black after they count down and explode, but there has been at least one instance of a block being left out of an explosion. As far as I can tell, there is very little discernable difference from the three difficulty levels, and it's possible to play songs that are impossible to lose on, even on the hardest difficulty.\n\nIf Turba offered custom BPM and beat offset settings per song (features other software is quite easily able to do), this game would probably be redeemable.

At first, it was fun cause you play the game while jamming your music. However, it gets real boring quickly. The problem of this game is scoring points. Why you say that? When you start to play, matching the color blocks (3 or more) will give you minimal points. To score big points, you must match the blocks from hearing the beat of the music. That's gonna be difficult, depending the tempo of the music you play. Sure you may score well when playing a slow melody but playing a fast tempo song is gonna be hard.\n\nTurba is an okay game but its not recommend to play forever.
