I have not played it since this update, if I do, I will revise my review. For now, it will remain the same. This is a review of the game I paid for, played and that the devs were content with for almost six months.\n\nTL,DR: Chronicles of a Dark Lord is an ineptly written game with somewhat tolerable combat. The story is cliche, the characters have no personality or diversity and the game's flow is extremely repetitive. The description promises a game that's dark, mature and complex, but what you get is juvenile, shallow and as dark as something like Naruto. Furthermore, even though the description promises that you'll get to make decisions that effect the game later that is not the case (aside from choosing whether or not to kill random NPCs).\n\n-------------------------------------\n\nFirst, I want to point out that one positive review on this page was written by someone affiliated with the developers. Looking at some comments on their Desura page, it seems like this is not uncommon for them. Even if I liked this game this would leave a bad taste in my mouth.\n\nFair warning, there are SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW.\n\nChronicles of a Dark Lord: Episode 1 Tides of Fate is the kind of game that gives RPG Maker games a bad reputation. It is one of the worst written games I've ever played. If an RPG is poorly written, it fails. This goes double for RPG Maker games, because the graphics are pretty standard across the board (some will have nice character portraits, the portraits in this seem to be generated in RPG Maker) and the gameplay is very rote JRPG fare.\n\nBefore I get into why Chronicles of a Dark Lord is so bad, I will talk about the few things I did like. The random battle system is very nice. It's not really random. There's a meter that fills up as you walk and decreases if you stand still. If it fills up, you enter a battle. There's lots of object hidden around in the environment. My love of RPGs has trained me to check literally everything. In this game it pays off and I like that. Finally, about halfway-ish through the game I found a hidden sword and piece of armor that was so over-powered I breezed through a lot of the game. That definitely helped me keep going. Also, the song during the end credits is pretty good. Marielle Thomas did a great job with it.\n\nSo, onto the problems. First, and most importantly, the characters have no personality. Well, they kind of do, but everyone is either quiet and serious or kind of goofy. There is hardly any distinction between your party members. Half of them even look the same. If I was forced to describe any of them it would be extremely difficult. That's not good. The characters should be diverse and interesting.\n\nThe main character, Magus, is the worst of all. No personality. Towards the end of the game, some characters have a conversation about how he doesn't show emotion. Guess what? That's not interesting. He's just kind of there. Everything interesting about him happened in the prologue and the text crawl between that and the main game. There's supposedly a conflict between the evil path he started down and his decision to not be totally evil. . .WE NEVER SEE THAT.\n\nMagus is supposed to be so dark. The only way the game really shows us that in the main game is that we are given the option to randomly kill some NPCs. That's the problem with the game in general: where's the darkness? This is supposed to be dark and mature, but it's not. The game tries too hard to also be funny and light for it to be dark. For instance, there's one part where you're in a cave and there's a rumble. Magus' wife says something like, "Either Magus is hungry or we better get moving!" The game doesn't have any of the edge it claims to have, but when you throw in lines like that, it's just goofy. Or, the conversation with a female NPC where the Dark Lord Magus says he'll come back later to pick her up so she can come visit his kingdom.\n\nHere's a line that just blew my mind: "She is going to cut my breasts off or something if we do not get out of her garden." That's in the game. Or, how about this line which someone says before fighting one of the final bosses: "I am Sapphire Darkwell. . .and I hate cats. It's because of YOU I have to institute a law against cats in Senefarria!" That is some dramatic and dark writing.\n\nThe storyline is really cliche. First, you're traveling around trying to rally people to fight an invading evil. Then, it turns out that (spoiler alert) the bad guys have a hidden agenda. They're trying to summon something to destroy the world. The dumbest trope in the world. Why do they want to destroy the world? What do they gain?\n\nThe script is super repetitive. I'm willing to bet 10% of the game is characters introducing themselves or being introduced. Magus seems to know every character he meets, but I don't. We usually don't really learn who they are, but we're supposed to care about them or be invested in what's going on. One character is recruited, then a side quest immediately becomes available where someone is trying to lure them into a confrontation. I don't know who that enemy was and I didn't care about what was going on. The whole game in general is repetitive. The bulk of it is: go to castle, talk to rule, get permission to go to next world map screen, fight boss, go to castle. World map screens come in two varieties: Castle and town and bridge/cave/docks or castle and bridge/cave/docks.\n\nThen, there's just weird stuff that makes me think the game was written by a 13-year-old boy. All your party members are female, except for Magus and someone you get at the end of the game. Why? There's no good reason. Also, three of your party members are women who Magus has had sex with. His ex-wife, his current wife and their lover. That's right, Magus has a wife and together they have a lover. Why? How did this happen? What is the attraction? What is the purpose from a writing perspective? It doesn't add anything. None of the three seem to actually be in love, they just call each other "my love." I guess for them to seem like they actually loved each other they would need personalities. Is it so we know how not gay Magus is? Is it so he seems cooler or more awesome? I'm not a prude. If the characters were more developed, if any of it served any purpose, it would be fine. It doesn't, though. There's also a city entirely populated by lesbians.\n\nThere's also just mind-blowingly crazy things. There's a character named Crysta Aier. Later, someone mentions "Krysta Aier." I thought, "Oh, a typo." Then, we recruit Krysta Aier and I thought, "Oh, I just remembered it wrong." Then, you re-recruit Crysta Aier and have both Aiers. Then, I didn't know what was going on. Finally, by chance, while checking a bookshelf, I found out that one of them is FROM ANOTHER DIMENSION. That's right. People's dopplegangers just pop in from other dimensions. Then, Magus remembers about the time that happened to him!\n\nOn top of the insanely inept writing, there are other issues. There's no mouse control and muting sounds doesn't completely work. Also, even though the description seems to promise that you'll get to make decisions that effect the game that is not true. The only decisions you get to make are whether or not to kill some random, nameless NPCs.\n\nI know that this review is extremely long, but the game is so flawed in so many ways I had to get it out (if only for my own sanity).","April 8, 2015","false","19.8"," 92 of 114 people (81%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","81","92","114","10","4"

Not too far in but there are a few things that jumped out at me right away:\n\n1. It's very much like Dragon Warrior 4, and it borrows concepts from Final Fantasy. They don't try to reinvent the wheel, which is a good thing, eg the thing that revives a dead ally is called a "phoenix feather," that which cures poison is an antidote. Simple and good.\n\n2. tl;dr - You can avoid battles when you want to /tl;dr. The battle system is turned based, and each character's time bar fills up at a rate based on the character's agility. Time stops when a bar is full. Encounters are not random on the world map or in encounter zones. Instead, a "battle bar" fills up with each step you take. When the bar is full, there's a battle. If you stand still for a second or two, the bar will begin to empty until it is.\n\n3. The characters and their abilities are good and balanced, and they don't contain fluff or spam.\n\n4. They did a good job of taking the elements of classic rpgs that drive you nuts / are overdone / are unrealistic out, and instead put in refreshing updates to an older genre. I don't want to give out spoilers but the protagonist is a bad ♥♥♥, not some wet behind the ears kid who just had his mind blown learning that he's the savior of the world or some whiney teenager with "teen angst." Npcs for the most part don't have duplicate dialog, meaning every npc you talk to has something different to say. They've completely removed unnecessary hyper-morality that is common in old school rpgs. The story and dialogue are interesting but not overbearing. There are many, many more examples of times you will find yourself smiling just because they did something better than it's been done in the past.\n\n5. Lesbians\n\n\nI have only a few criticisms of the game at this point, and none of them are "bad."\n\n1. Character sprites in battle are the same as they are on the map, while enemies' sprites in battle are elaborate. I would have made artfully elaborate battle sprites for each of the characters to give them more depth, personality, and make them more likeable over all.\n\n2. There are two areas in the game so far where it seemed to be "laggy," which doesn't make sense because it's basically a super nintendo game. One area had "fog" which seems like it could almost make sense, but the other was in a castle i beleive.\n\n3. If you turn off all three sound options (listening to music, at work, etc), there are two sounds during battle that are still heard. Issuing battle commands and critical strikes.\n\n\n\nAs you can tell from these "criticisms," there's nothing not to like about this game. Buy it.\n\nI don't often write reviews, but this game only had two at the time of this writing, so i wanted to endorse a good game. I will update this review once I have more time in.","December 26, 2014","true","6.0"," 48 of 69 people (70%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","70","48","69","3","1"

It's a typical "bad guy wants world domination" thing, and there aren't any big plot twists or surprises in the bland story. The characters are very different than what you'll find in a typical jrpg, but they lack any real depth. Your party members are all important people, monarchs, badasses, with you the greatest of them all, but you're never given any serious backstory on any of them, and the game only takes a shallow dive into their personalities. The game also seems to favor women a lot, with plenty of lesbians and only one male in your party, but that's fine.\n\nSo what makes the game worth playing? Well, the combat is solid. Characters' abilities are all useful, items are often essential, boss fights are common and tough, and occassional grinding is a must. If the dev could take this battle system and expand on the story and characters to lend more meaning and emotion to the fights, this game would be fantastic. Hopefully the sequels improve that way.\n\ntl;dr: Usual story, different but shallow character types, solid combat. It stays entertaining enough to play to the end.","December 28, 2014","true","26.2"," 31 of 46 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","31","46","2","0"

(leaning more toward's 3,or 5)\n\nThe Music for this game is actually also really good (you will have the battle theme stuck in your head for week's) and so is the art direction and spell effect's\n\nCombat is standard Turn based, with character's able to act once their "battle gauge" has filled up, but feels quick battle's never seem to drag.\n\nAlso a REALLY good plus for this game is the lack of Random Encounter's, instead you have a Battle Bar that fills while not in battle with every step you take but stopping cause's it to go down slowly basically allowing you to control wether you want to battle or not (you still need to of cause due to the boss fight's) and you WILL need to level up cause some of the boss fight's are utterly brutal, exploiting your weaknesses and barrageing your party with high damage attack's, basically get used to ressurect and look after your Healer, she WILL save your life many time's.\n\nCharacter's are a step above generic RPG protagonist's ( Your family and Wife can fight with you) rather than the normal boring cliche's "Silent Main Hero" "Love Interest who get's kidnapped" etc, they feel like they have their own personalities without feeling like cliche.\n\n\np.s you can also blow up Teddy Bear's... cause sure why the hell not :)\n\nUpdate: The Rebirth Update is actually quite a good enhancement to the game, adding better looking battle sprites, spell effect's, Resolution option's and I think although I might be wrong, new music as well, also the performance of the game is now silky smooth when before it was quite choppy if you chose to play fullscreen.\n\nWith the Steam summer sale on, and this game at the moment being £1 by all means get it :)","May 28, 2015","true","19.9"," 12 of 22 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","12","22","0","0"

It's fine at a lower resolution though, and a resolution screen pops up every time before the game launches, so it isn't a hassle. Still, be prepared to play in windowed mode for the entire game.\n\nPerhaps this is another RPGMaker problem but there's no "objective" screen. At least, I can't find one. So if you miss what a character says (or forget) then you'll be looking for a guide or wandering aimlessly until you figure it out.\n\nAside from the technical difficulties, the game is good. Not as good as a professionally made RPG but still solid. The enemies lack variety, you'll see the same creatures over and over, a some of them spam annoying poison attacks, but at least you've got a healer in your party who can cure you for a small amount of MP.\n\nYou'll run into challenging monsters who are levelled just right so they're not unbeatable.

Chronicles of a Dark Lord is a retro style RPG game, poorly finished. Sometimes the character is confused with the floor through the use of generic textures and excessive dark colors (as if the person playing this game is not realized by the actions of the character and the story about the dark nature of the main character).\n\nMusic is terrible. Ok, it's a retro game, but music can be better, the graphics can be improved by using own textures, and not abuse the generic textures.\n\nIn the section of the gameplay, does not offer support for the mouse, and does not support all game controllers; so the only option is to play with the keyboard, with all the discomfort that means. Failure to skip all the endless and annoying text scenes makes the game experience even worse.\n\nI have nothing against the games made with RPG Maker. In fact, I enjoyed games like Victim of Xen and Memories of a Vagabond, but this game is far from offering the same game experience.\n\nFor the price it costs the game is not worth buying, it's a waste of money.\n\nMy score: 3/10\n\nNot recommended.","March 6, 2015","false","4.6"," 22 of 45 people (49%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","49","22","45","3","1"

When you do not Level up from lv 1 it´s evry hard to even get the first win/s! But it get´s better the more you Level (they suddenly get pushed to good Stats)\nAs a RPG Maker lover i also like this game very much (Story is a very Interesting one!)\nYou´re not the Good guy´s haha..you also can kill ppl if you Talk to right one (haha she deserved it though somewhat)\nAs for the Gameplay is Typical battle like System but the World map is weird/facinating in the same time! (a 3D like Scroll world?! Well made, never saw anything like that!)\nSo far as i have played (second Kingdom finally arriving) the Story still seems to be good and i also meet someone i didnt thought i would see haha. Great Plot.\n\nAfter getting more through. I noticed the characters look so simliar. Yeah some are family but even those are not looks too similar. Would have been better if there are more differences between the characters. As for the story i get tiny parts from time to time also a lot of bosses. And the equip sometimes is just getting a new one after new one when you just shortly chanced locations!\nWhen you want to get the equip its also perfect for ahving the characters on a good level, so you have no problems killing a boss, bes ure to get the equip and the level ups while you do it you also get new skills 8some of em are hell good and sometimes needed. In the very early game you will need to level up to survive also and get the first good healing skill and after the ony ally healing you also get on around lv 7-8 a all ally healing which often saved my live by now!\n\n@ first i thought they would bringt Darkness again over the world but it seems after Magus lost his power he became sane again. So while traveling with all you will have a lot of changes in your party meaning you shouldn´t focus on just one char making it perfect. Also Magus seem to be a grown up man who thinks for the best again. As that said they want to bring peace and save the rim kindoms from the threat they confront about.\n\nAfter know finishing the game i quess it was just a Ending as i did had thought of. There are still some Extra´s i didnt finished due to power (i know of 4 extra´s where you need to be stronger than Final Boss!)\nAlso the game say´s something about a Continue + for the game (Credits in end)\n\n\nHere is now a small list how i would give points for the game in each categorie:\n\nGameplay: 9/10 (Classic, yet its cool with Unique things!)\n\nGraphics: 9/10 (Typical and also improved or enhanced Graphics!)\n\nSupport: ?/10 (never needed)\n\nPrice: 9/10 (5€ i got it for 0,99€ i think, it is stil worth the money also on full price)\n\nStory: 9/10 (I am a RPG Lover so a Great Story is a must have for Games i play, i need to say this game was interesting all the way through the game!)\n\nSound: 8/10 (Music is very good, but can be Annoying if you want to play the game without Breaks. The Music feels annoying after a time.)\n\nPerformance: 8/10 (sometimes it lags a bit when i want to make fast moves like getting 2 chars ready with skill it lags due to the enhanced scripting they had made i quess)\n\nFAZIT: 8.6/10 (Classic, improved RPG!

This is worth skipping games in the engine for that reason alone unless your not very social or don't care about Achievements, but I found this to be a negative.\nI generally only play these games for the battle system, so I'm not really going to say much about the story, but the battle system is rather generic.\nThe problem I have with this game is that all you do in battles is use special moves and heal. As your team levels up, you will begin to do insane amounts of damage in the 1000s which means any weak attacks is a waste of time.\nThe flow of the game is basically going from one town/dungeon combo to another, fighting about three of the same enemies in boring dungeons using your most powerful specials, and buying ether to keep the MP up.\nYou will get a flock of similar characters (almost all female) to join you as you progress, but you will eventually find that only some of them are strong enough to invest your time in.\nI did read a lot of the story, but I found it to be rather boring. The music and sound effects are nothing special either.\nI never once considered this game to be fun, exciting, or creative.\nThere are better RPGs to play, using better more updated game engines. Don't waste your time or money here like I did.\n","October 4, 2015","false","30.0"," 12 of 26 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","12","26","0","5"

In the right hands, RPG-Maker is a powerful tool that can be used to make a low-budget game that's actually worth playing. This isn't one of them.\n\nIt does a few somewhat interesting things: random battles can be seen ahead of time, thanks to a handy bar at the top of the screen on the world map; the characters will talk breifly after a battle is over; and the story is completely unorthodox - but despite these few redeeming traits, it's clear the author of the game has no idea how to really /make/ a game.\n\nYeah, you can move around and do things and fight things, but from the get-go the main character is extremely unlikable and we're given no reason to care whether he lives or dies. The story is also bizarre; when the game first started up, I thought it was going to be a reversal of the typical RPG hero story - y'know, where you play as the good hero from humble beginnings and gain strength and beat the bad guys. I was actually kind of excited to play through an evil overlord's rise to power. Then the game time-skips past all of that to when the empire is already formed. ...And that's about where I stopped playing.\n\nI could go on, but I don't think I have to. It's really, really not worth your time. I'm sorry, game creator, but brush up on basic storytelling before trying anything like this.","October 5, 2015","false","3.8"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","6","14","0","0"

Magus was desperate to lead his father's forces in thier final push against their foes, but his father, being a Dark Lord, was cruel and belittled Magus. He denied Magus this chance, so Magus took matters into his own hands, and went to the battlefield. There, he confronted his father, and as they argued, the Dark God gifted Magus incredible powers. With this power, Magus killed both his father's and his father's enemies within seconds. He then banished his father to another land, and took his place of Dark Lord. Within the next few years, Magus took over many lands, but was soon defeated in a battle. From this, the Dark God took his powers away, leaving Magus helpless and weak. And now, he is rising in power again....\n\n\nPros: I somewhat enjoy the difficulty of the game. If you don't play just right, you'll need to grind and farm XP and Gold to buy potions, weapons, and armor. I also enjoy the idea of playing as an evil being, and how he is fighting another evil. With this, I enjoy how combat is played out, and how there is a random encounter meter in the open world. Finally, I like the dark humor in the story.\n\nCons: I dislike how much I have had to farm to get powerful enough to fight bosses, and I also dislike how magick users don't have as much MP as I would want and need to keep reviving and healing allies. Even with the humor, I don't like how it ruins the Dark feeling in the game.\n\nFinal Thoughts: I would recommend this game. I like how it runs, and how it feels. For those who want to try this, I recommend you buy it.","July 10, 2015","true","20.4"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

This woudl be fine...if this game came out a decade ago and we were trying to play it on a modern machine. But, that isn't the case, this game is fairly new and when it was developed resolutions like 1900x1080 had already become one of the de facto standard resolutions. There's no reason for this game not to work in that resolution other than sheer laziness or ineptitude from the developers.","May 10, 2015","false","0.2"," 5 of 15 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","5","15","0","0"

When it reacts, the main menu is missing, and only get a black screen. If you press enter, the game loads properly, but it's annoying start the game blindly.\n\nI can't make my MaxFire G12-U game controller works with this game. Having to use third party software to fix the problem can't be considered "full controller support".\n\nIf retro style means old school bugs, flaws and compatibility issues, this devs definitely accomplished their objective.\n\nIt is a pity that all the good things of this game go unnoticed by all the bad things, because it really has a very good story, quite extensive and compelling, where your decisions in the game affect the storyline, turning yourself in the true protagonist of the game.\n\n\nDespite all the good things I found on it, I can't recommend this game in it's current state.\n\nMy score: 2/10","March 20, 2015","false","4.4"," 11 of 29 people (38%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","38","11","29","4","1"
