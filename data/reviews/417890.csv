Visually stunning, really nice 'n' natural-feeling controls, solid sound...there's not much to complain about here.  Especially for FREE.\n\nI can only suspect that it's even "better" in multiplayer, as that's what it's clearly intended for, but alas: a. No one else in Australia seems to be playing it right at this very moment (it is, in all fairness, 3.30 in the morning), and b. I generally couldn't be arsed with multiplayer games anyway, especially with strangers.  I'll definitely buy the aforementioned single-player game on the strength of this, though, and wouldn't hesitate to recommend this to all you people out there - all several BILLION of you, far as I can tell - who do indeed enjoy the multiplayer experience.\n\nA thoroughly excellent side-scrolling beat-'em-up, whichever way you look at it.\n\nVerdict: 8.5/10.","December 8, 2015","true","1.1"," 84 of 97 people (87%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","87","84","97","13","5"

There's no cosmetics, microtransactions, or P2W elements. It's a game that's just pure fun.\n\nIt's a 2D fighting game, with Smash Brothers-like controls (rolls, jumps, running, blocking etc). It's a proper arena-like combat style, where you start with just a sword and a shield, you can collect different weapons around the map, such as spears with various reach lenghts, daggers, throwing hatchets, and bows with explosive arrows. There's also grenades, and "large throwables", which will slow you down, but what do you expect from carrying a boulder?\n\nThere's a wide variety of maps, such as torture chambers with swinging axe hazards around the map, and rocky caves, allowing for a vertical fighting style rather than the normal horizontal stages.\n\nThe only thing that needs improving on is server stability. Random disconnects every now and then, as well as very laggy  servers, even if you join one that is hosted in your area.\n\nHonestly though, It's a 100% FREE game. It's fun, and it doesn't cost anything but your time and 600mb of storage space.","December 11, 2015","true","4.3"," 32 of 32 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","32","32","0","0"

No one seems to use the chat function, so you rarely see anyone communicate. On the other hand, there are plenty of players. You can host a game and wait a few minutes. Soon, players will begin to join until it reaches the max of 8.\n\nWhen it comes to gamemodes, there's DM, TDM, and Elimination. There seem to be no objective-based gamemodes, which isn't bad, but it may be a nice addition.\n\nOverall, this game is very enjoyable and fun with friends.

The artwork, characters, levels. The pure design and even soundtrack of this game is put at 10/10 for me. You can pick your character skin from various past warriors, even skeletons, and a goat looking character. You have various weapons that you can use, and all of them can be thrown. Some of the weapons are 'swords, maces, axes, spears, javelins, bow/arrow, greek fire, boulders and other projecticles that can be thrown, along with different shields that vary in height/width.' Some maps are large, others are small for quick deathmatches. The game modes are deathmatch, team deathmatch, and a form of team deathmatch where once you die, you are out till the next round. So a 4v4 can quickly turn into a 1v4 if you aren't careful. It's easy setting up a match/server, and even joining others. Aside from that, you have local mode. It allows you and a friend on the same computer to play this game. This game is free, and worth trying it out. It's a game that I'll have fun playing over and over with friends.

Apotheon Arena is a very simple, very intense, and very bloody game that allows players to take on the roles of ancient warriors as they do battle, individually, across some very beautifully rendered artistic backgrounds. The graphics and the musical score both contribute to a wonderful atmosphere which evokes a sense of wonder for the time period and creates the perfect sense of invitation to players who want to feel like Greek gladiators, or warriors.\n\nThe controls are a little clunky (I use a controller), but it's very easy to learn and adapt to, and I appreciate it because it puts the focus on timing, execution, and how to use the various weapons available. There are a good number of options when it comes to weaponry, and each of them can, and should, be used in different ways in order to attack the other players. A good player will be knowledgable in how to utilize several weapon types, and will be able to adapt in a moments notice in order to stay flexible during a melee.\n\nIt should also be noted that many have reported various connection issues during matches, or having difficulty even getting into matches. I've only ever been able to actually join and play in a game once, with all other times providing errors. I usually just end up hosting and dont' have a problem with it then.\n\nI do recommend it, and think it's a great game, though some players may want to take into consideration both the somewhat clunky controls, and the potential connection problems.","December 14, 2015","true","12.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Although in alpha this game is remarkable, the graphics are amazing and the way it runs is just brilliant. Apotheon Arena is a survival game where you start with a 2 bandages, a rock and a torch, you then proceed to gather materials and make a house. As the game goes along it gets harder to make items which gives it a longer play time. The PvP aspect is amazing as a half naked man can run over a hill and demolish you which is pretty funny in my experience. I rate it 9/10 just as I feel the updates need to be a little faster.\n\nEDIT NEW APOTHEON ARENA\n\nThis game just gets better not only are the devs dedicated enough to rework the game completely, they update it every week! The graphics are god like and the PvP is even better than before although a half naked man killing you, usually involves a bow or a spear and you end up crying in a corner.

However I have encountered some frustrating things in my brief time playing.  First of all is the lag, usually you do not know if you actually hit someone or if they hit you for a solid 5-10 seconds. Second is the fact that playing multiplayer, I have had multiple people disconnect just because they died (as the host). Normally that is not bad except that finding an open server can be a pain.","December 8, 2015","false","0.6"," 8 of 20 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","8","20","0","0"

Its a 2d platform based arena (obviously) and you spawn with your greek default weapons a sword and sheild. you can pick what skin you want but this makes no stat diferance. as you run around the map you can pick up all kinds of greek weapons, and whats great about this is all weapons are melee and ranged! So while your running you can throw your friken sword at someone! You got your basic gamemodes like deathmatch, team deathmatch and elimanaition. The controls are a little weird but there esay to get used too.\n\nthe graphics are beautiful, when you see them you think greek mythology! there is some nudity but its very little and only at the menu. and its ment to symblise the beauty of the human body, plus its greek mythos what do you expect.\n\nthe music is great and very beautful but i wouldnt go putting it on mixtape. over all i give this game a 8/10!\nits fun, its addicting and i love it!!!","December 19, 2015","true","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It combines side-scrolling combat with a art style resembling ancient Greek pottery. Combat can be of a various nature, with traditional swords and spears that bear resemblance to the famous Spartan Armies among other weapons such as war axes and bows that share more resemblance to the Persians.\nThe general goal is to kill as many gladiators as possible in order to rack up a tally. The gladiator with the highest tally wins, although some servers choose to be a free-form battleground instead of a competition.","December 18, 2015","true","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game types are standard, but in case you need clarity. Elimination is a free for all where you only live once and last person alive wins. Deathmatch is a free for all where the player with the most kills wins. Team Deathmatch is a team game where the teams the the most kills wins. But what do you get for winning a game? Nothing. There is no XP or progression of any type in this game.\nCombat: In this game you have main melee weapons and a secondary ranged weapon. You will always start out with a sword and your fist. You can pick up as many weapons as you like and they'll be stored in your 1 and 2 buttons respectively. Most attacks are telegraphed and cannot be canceled. This is relevant because everyone has a sheild and may use their sheild to block basic attacks. However sheilds can break and do not guard your entire body.\nBots: Yes there are bots. You can only have a limited amount of bots, but the true value is a bit confusing. Bots typically take up spots if a player leaves the game and games can start with bots enabled. Bots have three difficulties: easy, medium, and hard. Easy plays like a human and hard has more hp and instant reflexes. I haven't bothered with medium since Easy felt like a good difficulty to put them on.\nHosting:  Easy, even without port forwarding I didn't have problems with people joining and leaving my game.\nLocal Co-OP: You can play local if you have a controller.\nStory: Nope\nRating: I recommend it. It's reasonably fun and free, but there's nothing that will keep me playing. If anything this game defintely made me want to check out the sister game Apotheon.","December 9, 2015","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are many levels and character customization options and to the best of my knowledge no microtransactions present.\n\nThis is like a demo for their other game just called Apotheon.","December 12, 2015","true","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game has perfectly-constructed combat mechanics with lasting PvP that make this game last. Playing with friends is a blast, whether your teaming with them or just playing against each other. Currently, I am happy with this game, but I have a few thing's that could be improved. One, I would like to see the port that the game run's on when I click host. Also, when I host a game, I want a few more options, like double damage, invincible mode, etc. that could add some funnier times when not in the mood for longer, intense battles. Another addition that would be welcomed is some bigger maps added to the roster. One last feature that could be added is a increase to the cap to how many player's can be in one lobby. Maybe a cap for smaller maps, but some of the maps that are currently in the game can probably support 16-20 people in at once without to much of a problem. Over all, for being a free game, this game is the best Free-to-Play games on Steam this year.","December 29, 2015","true","11.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game types are standard, but in case you need clarity. Elimination is a free for all where you only live once and last person alive wins. Deathmatch is a free for all where the player with the most kills wins. Team Deathmatch is a team game where the teams the the most kills wins. But what do you get for winning a game? Nothing. There is no XP or progression of any type in this game.\nCombat: In this game you have main melee weapons and a secondary ranged weapon. You will always start out with a sword and your fist. You can pick up as many weapons as you like and they'll be stored in your 1 and 2 buttons respectively. Most attacks are telegraphed and cannot be canceled. This is relevant because everyone has a sheild and may use their sheild to block basic attacks. However sheilds can break and do not guard your entire body.\nBots: Yes there are bots. You can only have a limited amount of bots, but the true value is a bit confusing. Bots typically take up spots if a player leaves the game and games can start with bots enabled. Bots have three difficulties: easy, medium, and hard. Easy plays like a human and hard has more hp and instant reflexes. I haven't bothered with medium since Easy felt like a good difficulty to put them on.\nHosting:  Easy, even without port forwarding I didn't have problems with people joining and leaving my game.\nLocal Co-OP: You can play local if you have a controller.\nStory: Nope\nRating: I recommend it. It's reasonably fun and free, but there's nothing that will keep me playing. If anything this game defintely made me want to check out the sister game Apotheon.","December 9, 2015","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game has perfectly-constructed combat mechanics with lasting PvP that make this game last. Playing with friends is a blast, whether your teaming with them or just playing against each other. Currently, I am happy with this game, but I have a few thing's that could be improved. One, I would like to see the port that the game run's on when I click host. Also, when I host a game, I want a few more options, like double damage, invincible mode, etc. that could add some funnier times when not in the mood for longer, intense battles. Another addition that would be welcomed is some bigger maps added to the roster. One last feature that could be added is a increase to the cap to how many player's can be in one lobby. Maybe a cap for smaller maps, but some of the maps that are currently in the game can probably support 16-20 people in at once without to much of a problem. Over all, for being a free game, this game is the best Free-to-Play games on Steam this year.","December 29, 2015","true","11.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

All I know is that Apotheon (singleplayer) is a fantastic game and it is very likely that this game is good as well. I just wish that I could play it. I don't know if anyone else has this problem, but on my computer, all I get is a black screen. I get all the music and everything, but nothing shows up. Once this is fixed, I'll give a proper review, but I can't truly judge anything based off of this. 0/10 for me, but maybe you can play?\n\nAnyways, here's my review of the base game itself, which I played on PS4 for free with PS plus. Honestly, I would gladly buy the game, but I have no money to spare. It's a fantastic game with AMAZING visuals, a pretty damn good story and glorious gameplay. I can see it becoming a cult classic. It needs more recognition and I hope to see more from this game studio. 9/10 for the base game. The only complaint was the inability to continue fighting as a giant and stay as a god, which I thought would have been a really cool thing to be able to do, since I found myself playing the fight with Zeus over and over again.","February 14","true","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I will go through and list the pros and cons to this game, its up to you if you want to look past them and enjoy and play it for yourself.\n\nCons:\nBots are smarter than humans who play this game\nBlocking sometimes doesn't even works.\nIf someone leaves then re-joins they are instantly healed and can be right behind you\nThe sudden flashes from attacks can cause a giant amount of lag\nThere is no option to reduce Quality\nServers are few in number\nYou can randomly die from anything\nSometimes ranged weaponary will go right through enemies\nSome traps are unfair to avoid i.e. the swinging blade\nCertain weapons are unfair and over-powered in comparison to others\nSome items are completely un-needed i.e. the Torch\nDisconnections can happen at random\nMost of time spawning will stick you between two players or bots\nBeing stuck in two different people's fight WILL kill you\n\nPros:\nInteresting concept\nGood and stunning design for Arenas\nA good selection of weaponary\nFast paced matches\nWonderful Bot names\nDifferent looking models\nCombat is at most parts a swell time\nMenu guiding is easy\nController support is wonderful\nGood connection to the original game\nAmazing backgrounds\nWell made music and sound-effects\n\n\nIn summary:\nI really want recommend this game for people but at most of the time, I find it a bit in terms for needs of improvement, some balancing could be done to make it a bit more fair and enjoyable, it has a good amount of flaws and a good amount of great things to love out of this little game","February 15","false","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

All I know is that Apotheon (singleplayer) is a fantastic game and it is very likely that this game is good as well. I just wish that I could play it. I don't know if anyone else has this problem, but on my computer, all I get is a black screen. I get all the music and everything, but nothing shows up. Once this is fixed, I'll give a proper review, but I can't truly judge anything based off of this. 0/10 for me, but maybe you can play?\n\nAnyways, here's my review of the base game itself, which I played on PS4 for free with PS plus. Honestly, I would gladly buy the game, but I have no money to spare. It's a fantastic game with AMAZING visuals, a pretty damn good story and glorious gameplay. I can see it becoming a cult classic. It needs more recognition and I hope to see more from this game studio. 9/10 for the base game. The only complaint was the inability to continue fighting as a giant and stay as a god, which I thought would have been a really cool thing to be able to do, since I found myself playing the fight with Zeus over and over again.","February 14","true","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A nice creative and enjoyable art style. Easy to learn controls. Nice real-time skill based combat. The game IS strictly multiplayer; therefore I do warn you that there's nothing this game can do for you if Comcast is feeling lazy like they always are. Even when your internet is at it's peak, though, the servers of Apotheon Arena definitely aren't the greatest. They will serve their purpose for the most part but there's bound to be some occasional, yet intense lag sessions, even in low population games amongst your friends. I highly recommend this game to anyone who has a friend or maybe even a few who would like to impale each other's faces with ridiculously long spears and other sexy weaponry.\n\nOverall Rating: 8/10 - Nice game, but the servers are a bit tipsy.
