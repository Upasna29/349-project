I am pretty sure the character has nothing to  do with El Chapo Guzman. You can play it with an Xbox controller, for a better experience.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHqkY0GZKYY\n\nGet it on sale.

The graphics are kept in a high resolution retro version which is totally fine and makes this Game a must have for every retro fan. The Game itself is a platformer with a well-made full controller support (tested with Xbox 360 Controller). The character (a prisoner) moves smooth and I did not notice any bugs while playing. The difficulty of the level slowly increases in a fair and enjoyable way over the 30 levels you can play.\nThe goal of the Game itself is to escape from a prison which is split in 30 sections. You will find many different items which can help you to escape from the prison. For example Guns and Helmets. The Game principle itself is very simple but makes the Game super fun. Also if you think the Game is too easy for you, you may also try to get the hidden Keys in every level.\nI totally recommend to buy this Game now (Since it has a -20%) because in my eyes the Game is worth far more than only $2.\n\nRating:\n8.8/10\n\nPros:  Well-made Platformer\nEnjoyable puzzles\nFull Controller Support\nA lot of different items\nWorks also on older devices\nWell-chosen music retro music\nCons:  No achievements\nHardware Information\n\nHardware   Type     Monitor   BENQ 24 inch 1ms     Headphones   Apple Earpods    Keyboard   Dell Basic Keyboard/ Integrated Alienware Keyboard     Controller   Xbox 360    Mouse   Zelotes T-90    Microphone   Integrated Laptop Micro     OS   Windows 7","March 20","true","3.3"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","5","8","0","0"
