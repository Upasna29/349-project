That animated turd found a mate and they together were married and had several turd babies. One of those turd babies married a used diaper. Together they had one child. That child grew up and became a game developer and created a game called Snow Cat Simulator to sell on Steam.\n\nThis is not Farm Simulator with snow.\n\nIt is a thrown together turd/used diaper which sucks.\n\n","November 27, 2014","false","1.4"," 463 of 656 people (71%) found this review helpful 54 people found this review funny","71","463","656","54","27"

Make a game about snowcat's, those vehicles which are very important on skiing centers. But, here's come but: The way how this game is done is horrible. We have graphics from 2005, i mean, c'moon this game is published in 2014, i expect little bit better graphics. Controls were average but i experienced some input lag, controls lagged little bit when minicat were on carage. +Props for multible vehicles!","March 28, 2015","false","0.3"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","38","3","8","2","3"

If you wanna have "fun" for a very long time, go and get it! A nice feature to extend the gameplay: save the game and you'll lose all your fuel. Very funny when you're at the end of the map and have to drive with amazing !!10Km/h!! back to the base!!! The controls are AMAZING and the mechanics are so creative!!!
