This game shows you the scenario's from Road to Hill 30 trough the eyes of Joe "Red" Hartsock. The game play is absolutely amazing and the immersion is phenomenal.\n\nThe enemies and the objectives in Earned in Blood are slightly better and harder, I really recommend playing this game on "normal" or harder difficulty to really get the developer intended experience especially the tactical game play.\n\nIf you have the time you should definitely play the games from the Brothers in Arms franchise. (9/10)\n\nPS: For people with field of view problems this is adjustable in the "user.ini" file located in the game directory.","February 25, 2014","true","6.1"," 31 of 32 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","31","32","0","2"

Road to hill 30\n2. Earned in blood\n3. Hell's highway\n\nthere is no spoiler for you here but you need to know one thing about the story, brothers in arms starts like a normal world war II story, you play as a man called Matthew Baker the squad leader of 13 soldiers, 13 fathers, 13 sons, 13 families.... 13 is not a lucky number! in Road to hill 30 you start the game some where near france after parachuting from your shut down airplane and then after a few missions 2 of your squad members die mysteriously and then story focuses on this question "how they died?", there is another member in your team called Joseph Hartsock, the squad leader of the  2nd squad in road to hill 30, in the first BiA you do not see this squad you only hear about them and see them in cutscenes but there are in no missions. in fact they are in same mission area as you are but they are operating in differnet part of the map which you only hear about in cutscenes of road to hill 30.\n\nIn Earned in blood you play as Joseph Hartsock the second squad leader and you play almost all missions from Road to hill 30 but in the eyes of Joseph Hartsock, he tells you a secret story of what really happened back in road to hill 30 however the question about how your two squad members died back in Road to hill 30 still remains unanswered. this question will be answered in Hell's Highway, and prepare some tissues because that game will make you cry and makes you extremely emotional.","November 27, 2015","true","0.3"," 29 of 31 people (94%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","94","29","31","4","0"

If you haven't played the first one then pick that one up first.  This is a continuation of the story from the first one.  I had originally picked this one up on disk and played it a ton.

Call of Duty 2, of course, was amazing for the African campaign. But Gearbox hold the title for recreating very important battles in the Normandy region in France. I mean, if you've played the games, then maybe you've seen the extras where pictures show how much detail they put into recreating the villages in Northern France. It's very remarkable.\n\nThe story, you play as Joe Hartstock, Red, in this one. Maybe you remembered him in Road to Hill 30. Well, this game takes place alongside Road to Hill 30 as Joe is recounting his actions to SLAMarshall, a war documentarian, recording the actions of combat troops for the military. Throughout the story, Joe sees his friends get injured, change their attitude during the war, and some of them unfortunately die. But that's war.\n\nThe audio design is unreal. My dad walked by when I was playing and noted how realistic the sounds were for the rifles and panzers. The soundtrack, too, is amazing. Basically, I'm biased as hell as I already love WWII anything, but the strong character development, friendship, and tactical elements make the Brothers in Arms games some of my favorites.\n\n9.0/10","September 2, 2015","true","7.6"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

But Earned in Blood turned out to live up to it. Even though the game came out within the same year (just over half a year later) as Road to Hill 30, I think it turned out much better. I enjoy the general setup over Hartsock detailing his events and perspectives. I cannot say much about the real-life people, obviously, but I find the execution of this game to be more involving.\n\nThe gameplay is essentially the same, but the level environments are slightly more developed and lively in comparison to the first game. I know that the games are said to be very realistic, but the first game seems to be more sparse in what you encountered. Further, Earned in Blood has a lot more capability of using the Four F's, whereas Road to Hill 30 did not as much.","April 19, 2015","true","7.0"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

It's mixed between cutscenes of Red and Marshall talking or conversations off screen at the beggining of missions or in quiet moments. Many old faces pop up again, including old references and very interesting moments where you get to see what happened whilst you were off playing as Baker in the previous title. The game stays true in general to the campaign in Normandy, and most of the battles/missions in this game were really fought during the second world war. The story is very intense and emotional in some places and succeeds like the previous game in showing the horror and violence of war.\n\nGameplay\nEarned in Blood is essentially the same core gameplay as the previous game, using the Four F's (Find, Fix, Flank and Finish.) You have two squads, the Fire team, and the Assualt team. You can command them to follow you, move to locations that you choose, suppress an enemy and even charge an enemy. One of the main HUD aspects is the suppression indicator on top of the enemies' heads. Red means unsuppressed and grey means suppressed and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ their pants. The basic method of overcoming enemies according to the game is to:\n\n1. Get your Fire team to suppress the enemy.\n2. Take you Assault team around and flank the enemy.\n3. Once you are at the enemies' flank, rek them.\n\nAlthough this is the barebones method, a lot of the time it isn't that simple. I came into this title expecting it to be the exact same combat as the previous game, but Gearbox have managed to switch it up a bit, with improved AI that will react to your tactical descisions, for example, if you flank the enemy and they know this is happening, they reposition themselves so they are protected and are safer from you/your men. That being said, I still did see some of the silly AI appearing like in the previous game, for example you order your men to take cover from an MG and they end up running around the cover and standing in plain sight. Also, there are some pathing issues which can lead to some annoying squad wipes. The guns sights sway like hell, so you will still find yourself missing easy shots although there are two new guns (Grease Gun, Scoped FG42) which can lead to some interesting firefights. Another addition to the game are the Flak 88's. These bad boys are a nightmare to go up against and can prove a real challenge, especially when multitasking in battle.  Unfortunately, the game doesn't have much of a replay value unless you are ok with replaying on a harder difficulty with less forgiving enemies and less HUD etc.\n\nMap Design\nCompared to Road to Hill 30, Earned in Blood has really knocked it up a gear in terms of maps. While still slightly linear (hard not to be in this genre) they are a lot more expansive and give you more options in terms of attack and flanking. Also, the game no longer stays in a green-french-rollinghills type of landscape and occasionally offers a change of scene with city combat, which is quite fun and engaging with all of the flank routes. This, combined with the better AI can lead to some challenging moments.\n\nGraphics, Animations and Sound\nEarned in Blood's graphics, animations and sound are pretty much identical if not exactly the same as the previous game. Textures are a bit murky and lip sync is not alway in time or accurate. The sound is very good in most cases, apart from some anomalies for example VERY MINOR SPOILER:(When you are attacked by the convoy of Germans and their loud horsies, the sound of the hooves is kinda loud and not in any general direction.) The soundtrack, like all Brothers in Arms games is fantastic and always sets the mood just right and makes emotional scenes just that bit more sadder. Although the graphics and animations are well below today's standards, this shouldn't be a problem unless you are somebody who only plays games for the high end visuals and not for the great gameplay and story.\n\nExtras\nThe game has many rewards for completing each mission, and the higher the difficulty level on which you complete the level, the more you unlock. Some of the things you unlock are real documents written by Colonel S.L.A Marshall about the interviews with soldiers, historic and de-classified documents about the conflict, pictures, diagrams, and even cheats for the game like infinite ammo and super squads etc. It's worth the extra difficulty for the rewards in my opinion.\n\nVerdict\nOverall this game is fantastic and just as good as the previous game, Road to Hill 30. Although they share many qualities, there have been many welcome additons to the game such as better AI and maps, as well as new weapons and enemies. The story in this game and infact all Brothers in Arms games is fantastic, really covering the emotional effect of war on both sides. The game has always given me a personal connection with the men in my squad, and really does make you feel guilty at the end of your mission if you didn't get that bundle of pixels home. If you're looking for a WW2 game with solid mechanics, decent realism, a super story with emotional moments and connections, this game is definintely for you!","January 29","true","4.9"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

And unlike CoD ammo conservation is key you can spray bullets and knowing you have hundreds of rounds in reserve, you only have a few clips. This game is focussed around real time combat strategy and when you run from place to place this makes you aim less accurrately and takes time to recover. The team you command during missions must be used effectively to complete the mission. This game I'd say on a level of realism is higher than CoD (by far) and slightly below Arma. I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys FPS and stragey based games. And throws you into the events of the days both before and after D-day and is historically accurate.","December 23, 2014","true","28.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The graphic is dated but that is to be expected for any game from before “Modern Warfare’s” era. The story in-game tells a fantastic tale about a solider behind enemy lines.  The very nice voice acting only adds to the immersive experience. One original feature in this game is the ability to zoom out in to tactics mode and analyze the battlefield, this allows for alternative strategies and less linear gameplay. Beating missions with impressive performance will unlock additional fictional history about the in game characters, as well as other small bonuses. I had a few gripes with this game. The game is stupidly over scripted; your experience will not change at all with a second play through, using different strategies and routes can lead to some problems such as un-jumpable ledges, un-jumpable fences, and other stupid obstacles blocking what appears to be “jumpable” in any other game.","May 18, 2011","true","36.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This game has some major issues though. The Allied AI is atrocious and causes a great deal of frustration, furthermore the game is riddled with artificial difficulty. A good example of this is the fact that a lot of times when you clearly should have hit an enemy you actually miss. This is mainly an issue if you try to for example shoot an enemy in the head when he pops out of cover.

I could easily say BIA: Earned in Blood and BIA: Road To Hill 30 are one of the best games ever made.

The game play is exactly the same as in Road to Hill 30.  I did not feel Hartsock's story as genuinely as I did Baker's, but the same characters that we love are back.  The maps were larger and the AI was a bit better.  I think the missions were more difficult and exhausting (and sometimes more frustrating).\n\nI made a mod for this game, with tons of new features including improved AI, multiplayer bots, and new soldiers to help your squad.","July 19, 2015","true","45.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
