It is terrible on every single level. Bugs, glitches, goblin darts, they're all there.\n\nMusic is awful.\nVoice acting is that of a Simlish Rammstein song.\nGameplay is poop.\nWhoever thought the idea of adding a grain filter so deep you could cut through it was a terrible idea.\nGame crashes galore.\nDO NOT BUY\n\nFURTHER ANALYSIS:\nThis game is STILL on Steam Greenlight since January 2014, waiting to be greenlit. However it has now been published by Strategy First, who have released about a hundred OLD games on Steam within the past couple of months. No early access, no greenlighting procedure, etc. I then took a look at the Strategy First website, and there is absolutely no mention of DEHON Monster(s) Challenge Circus.\n\nThis is not an old game. This was started in 2010, and was just released yesterday (16/05/2014). Who the hell greenlit this? Who sat at a desk with three hundred other games and said "YEAH THIS IS OK TO RELEASE. GREENLIGHT IT"\n\nI'm honestly not sure what FreeGamer's goal here is with this..... thing too. They certainly aren't a professional studio, that's for sure, with one post refering to their logo which is a crudely drawn GOAT, and connects this with the line of games they are associated with. WHO CARES! What matters is the GAMEPLAY!\n\nIn my initial review I forgot to mention that the game crashes every single time after dying, and choosing a game mode.\nI also forgot to initially mention how ridiculously short this is, with four RIDICULOUSLY SHORT STORY MISSIONS and then 4 survival arenas. FreeGamer promised 3 to 4 hours of gameplay. That is crap.\n\nUPDATE #2: I just downloaded the demo of this game that was made available on Gamershell. Already I could see that the file sizes were similar. However...aside from only two levels only being available for each game mode, and less than 1MB difference, the file contents of each of the versions IS THE SAME.\nHow the hell did you think you could get away with this?!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gq1hoZaFNck","May 16, 2014","false","1.1"," 140 of 159 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","140","159","2","2"

Poor controls, sluggish responses, poor player direction, looks as though it was developed by someone with severe cataracts, bad sound direction and an incomprehensible story.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PutYoGwassesOn/recommended/300910/","PutYoGwassesOn","Gubs","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PutYoGwassesOn/","87 products in account","I usually don't review games because there are usually other people to do it, however in this case the game is still pretty unknown for the most part and the reviews I feel don't do enough justice to this game.\n\nTo start off, I'm sure you can already tell this game is bad. But no, you won't know until you've played it. The UI is awful, ugly, clunky; pretty much every negative word you can think of. And that almost sums up every single other aspect of the game. The graphics would have been acceptable for an indie game, but the creator felt slapping a grainy filter on it would give it a more distinct look. It does have one though, it distinctly looks like ♥♥♥♥. The voice acting is cheesy, in a foreign/made up language, and it's obvious the developer was trying to create a sense of role-playing as the main character Dehon and to reinforce the fact that he's a... Great Disciple of the Caste of the 40,000 Moons? Story, there is no ♥♥♥♥ing story. It's copy-pasted "defeat the evil; save the world" ♥♥♥♥. The gameplay, this is easily the worst part of the game, yes even worse than the name "Monster Challenge Circus". There's so many pointless skills and features, and pairing that with the stiff point and click controls and terrible level design makes a minute in this game feel like five. Combat and movement is so slow, and there's no reward for killing an enemy. No expirience, no money, no notes, no anything. It's just ♥♥♥♥ing awful and tedious. You will hate the combat after your first encounter with an enemy, I am dead serious.\n\nFinally, I feel the need to bring up I've played other despised indie games before like The Letter and Bad Rats. This game somehow beats them in being even worse. The Letter was awful but kept you hanging around until the end just to see how bad it could get, Bad Rats has a unique charm that although very ♥♥♥♥♥♥ makes it enjoyable for an hour or two before you get bored. But this game has no charm, no interesting story to keep your interested, not even memorable bad things. It's just very forgettable. Don't buy it as a joke, don't buy it to gift to your friend, don't buy it to play it just to see how bad it is. You will gain more spending the 50 cents on a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ toy from a gas station. It has more excitement and enjoyment than this excuse for a game, and how it got through Greenlight I will honestly never know.\n\nPros:\n-You'll play it for 5 minutes and forget it the next week.\n\nCons:\n-The single worst game you will ever play.","December 28, 2014","false","0.1"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","16","18","2","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/monsieur_owly/recommended/300910/","monsieur_owly","Monsieur-Owly","http://steamcommunity.com/id/monsieur_owly/","860 products in account","To make it simple, Monster Challenge Circus is probably the game that depicts hell in the most convincing way :\n\n-clunky camera control\n-confusing spell selection\n-unintuitive mission objectives\n-oversimplistic combat system\n-glitchy gameplay/cutscene transitions\n-horrible use of film grain, if not the worst in video game history\n\nAs a demon that lust for revenge you must make your way through 4 levels that will take less than 1 hour to complete, even with trial and error.\n\nTo make things even worse, the story revolves around a father-son relationship that is strangely reminiscent of Freud's oedipus complex. How awkward could it get?\n\nTo be honest, it is quite disappointing that Monster Challenge Circus turned out as an unfinished product since it had some potential. Imagine a game like Sanity : Aiken's Artefact but with a Thrill Kill/Silent Hill twist. This is what the game could have been.\n\nHere is the full playthrough :\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPZ7_dQnDY4\n\nRating :\n1.0","September 12, 2015","false","1.0"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","9","9","2","0"

The story is a little incomprehensible, I have no idea what the origin language is (Russian?), the events of the game seem bizarre and alien. The controls are weird (it doesn't even mention the space bar which seems to slow time & defend when you aren't moving, in addition to allowing you to turn the camera) and inexplicable.\n\nIf you want to experience something unique and bizarre, grab this when it's on sale.\n\nI don't recommend this as a game that's fun to play, I recommend this because it's so weird that it has to be experienced.
