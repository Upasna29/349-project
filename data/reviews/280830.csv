This game is basically a poor man's Super Mario Strikers. It's 5-on-5 (counting the goalies) soccer with environmental hazards and various special moves. It's fun in a very goofy way. The English seems odd, there are bugs (including a few frustrating ones that stop the match and force the user to quit or retry), and the AI could use a little tweaking. The developer is aware of some of the issues, but they haven't updated the game for months, so I don't think we're going to see any fixes. Overall, it's fun, cheap, and goofy, so it might be worth your time and money.","November 16, 2014","true","4.0"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","82","9","11","3","0"

Each round is essentially a new game with about 3 minutes to score on each others. There are some bugs, when I shot the ball and it went in the net... it counted as a "penalty shot" not a goal.

After an hour, it stops being fun and all the bugs seem to appear twice as annoying. There is something wrong with about every aspect of the game, which is a shame because the game would have be really fun, and is if it's not buggy.\n\nA few problems it has:\n- The controls are clunky. Movement is not very responsive and sometimes buttons don't do anything or are significantly delayed. This is very fustrating and one thing that has lead to the game being bad.\n\n-The AI is terrible. Every now and then there is a match where it doesn't totally mess up but on average the AI is bad. For instance, one of the opposing players missed a goal, feet from my goal line, with the special move. In fact, the ball shot off at a 90 degree angle...\nThis then lead to a goal kick?! Which makes no sense and leads on to another annoying bug. Sometimes you can score a goal and it be a corner, other times the opponent could kick it out (miss the goal) and it be a corner to them. The opponents are also the only people that seem to be able to cross it...\n\n-The interface is full of english mistakes. I'm assuming this was done by someone whose first language is not english, and there is nothing wrong with that, however if you are going to release a game in english at least make sure it's actually english. A lot of the terms are wrong, such as throw ins are called 'touch'?, goal kicks are 'penalty kicks', shots are 'shoots', dribbling is a button for special abilities and has nothing to do with dribbling and the list goes on. It makes the game feel very amatuer and like a really lazy translation.\n\n-The story mode is stupid. The story itself I have no problem with and the variation between opponents and teams is good, one of the only good things about the game however the way you have to progress is stupid. You have to collect a few stars (which are linked to the achievements) throughout the story mode, challenges that you can complete during the match i.e. score a total of 10 goals. Again that's great and another reason why this would be fun HOWEVER if you do not get all the stars you can not simply replay the match. You have to complete the entire story mode and then restart it from the beginning and play the entire story mode up until that point... The majority of the stars you can get in one go however one match requires you to win a match without any fouls as well as winning a match with 5 or more fouls, which means to complete that level you'd have to complete the whole story twice (assuming you can get them in one go, which is really hard due to the whole tackling mechanics being just as bad as the rest of the controls).\n\nThere is barely anything that makes me want to continue playing and if I wasn't such an achievement hunter I'd have given up but I have to play through the story a few more times for the stars... Even at £4 this isn't a great game, I'd go as far as saying you shouldn't even really pick it up in a sale unless it's really cheap and you don't get fustrated easily. If this is in a bundle, I'd say get it but only if this isn't the best game in the  bundle...","July 5, 2015","false","2.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Play it in short bursts with other games as a playlist to get the best out of it. I wouldn't recommend the single player at all, co-op or nothing really. Also I recommend you wait for it to go on sale unless you hate money.","February 5","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

All in all, had some brief moments of fun, but the controls need to be much tighter, and passes and kicks need to feel meatier.","February 8","true","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
