I am not actually affiliated with him in any reasonable way, aside from exchanging a few words now and again. Nonetheless, my opinion might be biased, that's why I'll try to explain it in detail. Oh, and I have finished the game when it wasn't on Steam yet.\n\nSo, first of all, a word of warning: The Moon Sliver is a game strongly focused on telling you a story, with very light puzzle elements. It stands somewhere between Gone Home in focus on freedom of movement and exploration and Dear Esther in telling a mysterious story which is quite open to interpretation. If this is something you are not into - not a game for you. If, however, previously named titles got your attention - read on. Or just buy the bloody thing, it's as expensive as two bottles of beer and my recommendation thingy glows somewhere around these words anyway.\n\nRight, you're still reading. First of all, I stand by the comparisons I have made above, so I'll use them as a baseline. At first, you're likely to notice two things - quite apparently lower production values and fantastic music. To elaborate: In terms of graphical design and fidelity, the game is not nearly as flashy as games like Dear Esther or Gone Home might be.\n\nGraphics are quite spartan, yet very functional. I feel that the simplicity of the graphical presentation is often enough used to set a feeling of loneliness and desperation, which it does quite well. At any rate, if pretty is what you're looking for, I'm sad to say that's not part of the package, and repetitive assets don't help much.\n\nMusic, on the other hand, is quite wonderful. It sets the tone very nicely and is used to underline the desired mood of individual locations.\n\nWhen it comes to most important bit of the game, the storyline, I find that the less you know when you start it, the better. Suffice to say it's captivating and definitely kept me playing all the way until the end of the game, which is not a particularily long journey, nonetheless long enough for me to lose interest in most games. Writing is very good, and aside from the way it handles reading notes (no, there's no voice acting, just a lot of quality writing), I was very happy with it.\n\nThe story is told both trough enviromental cues you can see in various locations and notes and books as already mentioned. You will also run across a few simple puzzles and the entire game is based around exploration of a small, yet very open island - you will not see the linearity of Dear Esther here, you can go just about anywhere, at any time you want, altho some locations require information obtained at other ones.\n\nRight, I have opened the subject earlier, but I feel I should elaborate on it a little more - the game is short. Even by Gone Home standards short. You'll beat it in under hour and a half, and you don't really have much of a choice in the matter as it doesn't support save states. The game is designed to be beaten in one sitting tho, and it's hardly too long, so that should not be an issue.\n\nAll in all, The Moon Sliver was an experience worth remembering, and that's more than I can say for most games that I have played recently. For the asking price, you're hardly even taking a risk, so if I got you even slightly interested, just go for it.","October 28, 2014","true","0.2"," 186 of 245 people (76%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","76","186","245","4","25"

It's blocky and undetailed and generally unimpressive in terms of graphical prowess. But that is, perhaps, part of what makes it so fascinating, because what this game lacks in anti-aliasing and high-definition textures it makes up for with its impressively bleak and tension-inspiring atmosphere. Along with well-done pacing and a plot that is steeped in mystery and slowly-answered questions, this nerve-wracking sense of environment makes for a short, dread-inducing game worth experiencing.\n\nThe game begins with the player spawning in a small room with a fireplace, some chairs, and a few empty barrels. When the player clicks one of these objects, a snippet of the storyline is displayed via text at the top or the bottom of the screen. Through the examination of these objects, four different characters, each with their own personalities, are described, and the player is left wondering which of these characters's shoes they have stepped into. The story itself is vague in the beginning, with more details being unveiled the more you explore the island you are trapped on.\n\nThroughout the game, there are lingering hints of a supernatural force on the island—a sense of another presence, something dread-worthy that stalks you as the day slowly grows darker. The tension of the Moon Sliver grows the more you learn about the characters and the betrayal they have faced. It reaches the start of its pinnacle in an underground maze (with a well-done flickering flashlight mechanic that occurs if you don't keep your light charged) and then peaks with the player's night time return to the mountain and the unveiling of the player's part in the story as well as the final confrontation with the malevolent force of the island.\n\nOf course much of the Moon Sliver's gameplay is optional. Players can skip most of the story entirely by simply refusing to explore. For that reason, perhaps, the Moon Sliver is a game that is what you make of it. This short story sets up the perfect environment for a creepy, unsettling journey—all it takes is an imaginative player to really sink into the text-based story and truly walk in the shoes of its protagonist. For anyone willing to fully explore the content the creators have left out for you on this barren little island, the Moon Sliver is a thumbs up.","January 11, 2015","true","0.8"," 49 of 55 people (89%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","89","49","55","4","0"

A sense of isolation, desperation and abandonment are the building blocks of The Moon Sliver, a minimalistic psychological horror by David Szymanski. I've been meaning to play this for a long while, and finally managed to spare an undivided hour to complete it, which is a prerequisite of completion since there is no save game feature. The game is intended to be played in one sitting of an hour, and all there is to explore would fill that hour completely anyhow. The definition of my experience was an effectively uncanny environment mixed with a bit bleak story revelation.\n\nThe game starts in complete darkness, in a warehouse that resides on a shore line, and there is no one else besides us. We learn that there "used to be" four people that dwelt on this island, yet there is only one now. We start walking, exploring the island and try to put things together through reminiscences of our character. By gameplay function, this is a walking simulation since there is nothing else to do rather than explore. So no monsters to jump at you if you are in expectancy of a "big bad wolf coming at you" scenario.\n\nThe island itself isn't that big; but the howling wind, the approaching darkness and constant clouds of dust establish an appropriately plain yet ominous setting. I wouldn't call graphics anything extraordinary - minimalistic even - but the choice and display in decoration combinations are in artistic value to set the mood. Added with a sorrowful soundtrack, there is no doubt that we exist in an ultimately forlorn geography without a clue to any happenstance and feel that isolation, that helplessness every second of our one hour gameplay.\n\nOn story purposes: aside being quite successful in atmosphere, The Moon Sliver either fails to explain much, or intentionally leaves matters unspoken. In either case, anecdotal memories or vague dialogues exchanged by intended characters don't reveal much aside a single act of desperation that would either doom or salvage the former inhabitants. There is no explanation for the purpose of the island, or how people ended up being there in the first place. As it is, this game feels like a glorious demo which would promise for things to come. I heard that there could be some explanation for the background in David Szymanski's next game, The Music Machine which I didn't play yet. If so, I strongly recommend playing two games back to back to track a complete story.\n\nDo I recommend it? Yes, for observing a complete success on establishing an atmosphere with too little in graphics, but on narrative achievement, I must say that I've seen better. For your half a dollar, it is a good experience. I'll be keeping an eye for more David Szymanski games in the future.\n\nUpdate: Now that I've completed the Music Machine, I'm positive that these two games should be played back to back. In unison, they form a beautiful story, the tale of a creation and its undoing. Buy them together, enjoy an age old story in some really radical context!\n\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","October 11, 2015","true","2.9"," 46 of 52 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","46","52","0","8"

The graphics aren't fancy, but they get the job done, and the music is fantastic. Tense and scary in the same was as Gone Home. It's not about jump scares or combat, but a feeling of dread that comes with being in near dark, and feeling like you're not alone. Yes, it is short, but it's also cheap. The asking price for the time to completion is comparable to Dear Esther. And for what it's worth, I didn't particularly love Dear Esther, so even if you're like me and thought DE was overrated, give this a shot.\nEdit: Also, if either you enjoyed this and want more of this kind of thing, or want to find out what the developer's work is like before you buy The Moon Sliver, I just played one of his free games, Fingerbones, and it does similar things with creating tension and fear through music and sound effects. http://jefequeso.itch.io/fingerbones","October 28, 2014","true","2.1"," 68 of 88 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","68","88","0","0"

Basically all you do in this game is walk around and try to not only figure out what happened on this island, but who exactly you are. If you are a bit patient and observant, you can answer both of those questions. You can click on items and notes to read them or initiate text to pop up.  There’s a fair amount of reading. There are also a few minor puzzles to solve which involve just searching carefully.\n\nThe flashlight mechanic is a bit of a nuisance because you have to keep recharging it to keep it lit, but I think the devs really wanted you to feel a sense of impending dread. The darkness does feel oppressive and the more you know about the story, the more your sense of dread will build.\n\nYou can beat the whole game in about an hour, and it's meant to be played that way. Be prepared for a fantastic ending too! All in all, a very unique and tense experience.\n","November 17, 2014","true","0.8"," 42 of 48 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","42","48","0","0"

The first couple of times I tried (and got interrupted) I was a little confused because I found doors I just couldn't open, but never actually got the time to explore properly, but I'm glad now that I finally did.\n\nFirstly, a warning of sorts, there's really not a whole lot going on in this game, the area youre able to explore is on the small side, there's not a lot of detail in anything, and there are no visible people ANYWHERE...that being said, what this dev did with what little he had at his disposal is well and truly worthy of praise.\n\nThe "lack" of detail in most of the surfaces is easily explained when a strong wind kicks up, blowing sand (albeit basic-graphics sand) everywhere, and we find out more about the island through various notes and remembered conversations.\n\nThe atmosphere and tension is far more palpable once you access beyond the few houses on the island, especially if you forget where the nearest charge-pont for your flashlight is located...\n\nIn all, I'd be remiss to do anything less than highly recommend this game, it's something that everyone should play at least once.\n\nTom Cullen/10 would freak out in the tunnels again","June 5, 2015","true","13.0"," 36 of 39 people (92%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","92","36","39","3","0"

I feel harsh for voting 'no', as the creator obviously put a lot of personal effort in, I almost wish there was a neutral vote, but I feel my experience with the game was a little more on the disappointed side.\n\nThe game's graphics and settings feel like something pre-Thief: The Dark Project (1998), with simple environments and blocky furniture. Whilst graphics do not make a game, I feel the setting and story being told here was supposed to be one steeped in atmosphere, and the blocky furniture and empty square rooms just detracted from that so much. Being minimal is fine (and the selected screenshots and trailer on the store page show an artistic appreciation for minimalism), but the game proper just felt a little too hollow, almost rushed and unfinished.\n\nThe games story is told to you by flashing up on screen as you move about, often making you stop to read it (as it disappears when you take a few steps away). Whilst this isn't a problem, certain sections (the ending especially) have long stretches of corridor where you need to take a few steps, stop, take another few steps, stop, over and over to read what's happening, breaking the flow of your journey. It's a little complaint, but one I felt really disrupted the experience of the story itself. Something visual to accompany these moments, or changes in direction would help a little too, or making the text linger for longer... but without this the temptation was just to run ahead and disregard the text.\n\nI did find the story interesting, and the sound design and a few surprises do help to ground the story in the world you're moving through. There's some great sound design once you get into the tunnels, and the text works well there too for selling the atmosphere of the moment, I genuinely felt quite creeped out in there. The rainy and stormy night that sets in towards the end is very atmospheric and the ending is a little chilling and makes you jump.\n\nThe narrative text of the story then ultimately makes up the majority of the experience... But ultimately it's let down by the set dressing that detracts, and a few design choices that work against the player's journey through the game. I do look forward to the developer's future projects, the game shows an interest in joining narrative and experience together and if that is worked on and polished it could end up being something quite special, but The Moon Sliver feels more of a proof of concept than a finished product.","January 3, 2015","false","0.6"," 46 of 58 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","46","58","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/329830/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","The Moon Sliver exists as a disheartening example of creative aspiration clashing with the cold reality of a developer's technical and artistic capabilities.\n\nIt's the undercurrent of a very clear want to do something meaningful that makes it sad to see the pieces attempt and fail to come together, leaving behind a mess of mixed narrative threads and ugly amateur game design. Though high production values and clever engine tweaks are by no means required to tell a compelling story through a game, I was rather unprepared for the shockingly bland textures and empty landscapes that make up the island you explore. There are attempts to provide a better sense of place through the placement of key objects in the environment, but the world is so entirely bare outside of them that there existence as poor attempts to build a more interesting setting jump out almost more than if there had been nothing at all. The lifeless architecture and layout of the island made it hard to become even a little invested in it, being so removed from the narrative as to act like little more than a way to disorganize and spread out the notes and dialogue exchanges that make up the story.\n\nEven with the abundantly sterile location I was still able to buy into the narrative, up until a point. The scattered pieces of plot leave a large amount up to the player (though reading poorly formatted text is about the most you will be doing) to decipher, and this ambiguity was intriguing and surprisingly well written as it attempted to flesh out a world and characters that the developer didn't have the resources to properly show. But for all it tries to do with its narrative, it eventually becomes clear that many of the stories The Moon Sliver starts, it has no intention of fleshing out or finishing. The troubled relationships between the few remaining inhabitants of the island, the purpose of the island itself, a mysterious supernatural object and the dark creatures it supposedly keeps away, and the internal moral struggles of certain characters are all briefly brought up, but never elaborated upon besides a simple surface overview that leaves more questions than it answers.\n\nIt's not that the story The Moon Sliver wants to tell couldn't exist without giving these answers, but with so much time devoted to setting a scene and almost none to actually turning said scene into plot when the story finally does want to end and give at least a cursory explanation as to what happened, the revelations feel contrived and flimsy. There was so much more I wanted to know, I'd have gladly pushed through the tedium of some baffling design decisions to find it, but The Moon Sliver is content to end saying little and accomplishing even less.","November 26, 2014","false","0.7"," 75 of 107 people (70%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","70","75","107","3","7"

I think the graphics are more than acceptable (not sure why some users complain... perhaps they need to stop using that integrated Intel crap or get thicker glasses) and the colors are suitably muted to accompany the intended atmosphere.  Since it's short the story is a bit less substantial than Dear Esther but if you liked that game you'll probably like this one.\n\nThe current user rating for this game (71%; as of June 2015) is exactly in line with my personal rating.  IMO it's worth the price but, as it has been on sale several times and also included in a Humble Bundle, you should be able to obtain it for less than full price.

Took about 20 minutes, but I basically knew what I wanted to do, as I wandered around in the game last night for like an hour before realizing I had missed something crucial and deciding to restart it. My advice would be to fully explore before entering any buildings to prevent this from happening.\n\nInteresting game. There are no saves, and it is intended for you to play through in one sitting. Basically, it is an island exploration game, where the story is revealed through your wandering until you reach the end. It's a subtle horror game. Subtle in that it isnt really designed to scare you, but rather to convey a sense of dread as you learn more about what is happening, until finally at the end, everything ties together and the story is complete. Kind of an experimental game from that perspective. It looked very cool, and the actual gameplay, (which consisted of your basic move, click on stuff, and jump around (although that is never a necessity) while carrying a flashlight around to help you see (as it is getting darker and deeper into the night as you progress)), was pretty seamless. There are basically two direct puzzles to solve, only one of which is actually required (and so only one of them is given clues to solve in the game...the other will strictly be trial and error, but can be solved pretty quickly) and two indirect puzzles to solve.\n\nI thought it was interesting enough for the dollar or two I spent on it. Some of you may already have this game by virtue of it having been in at least one bundle as well. Worth trying out IMO.

Because frankly, while I genuinely appreciate what it's trying to do, it ends up being just another horror-esoteric-exploration-walking-art game. Its narrative is interesting at times despite the fact that I didn't appreciate the way it was delivered on the screen, and there are occasionally some nice moments of writing in it. Thematically it touches on one side on the occult and on the other on the existential horror of loneliness and guilt and the complicated nature of human relationships. But its existential despair ended up feeling trite, mainly because it was unsupported by the many rough edges of the gameplay, the writing and the atmosphere.\n\nThere are some good moments in the (less than an) hour of gameplay it offers, moments when the game sustains its atmosphere of horror, moments when your interest in the characters is peaked. The ending is actually one of those good moments, which is a big bonus point in my book. But there are also many moments of confusion, of frustration at the game design, of not knowing what to do next, of not being clear enough on who is who to actually enjoy the relationship drama played out in the dialog snippets you discover, and of wondering if you're really interested enough to keep playing. And there are simply too many rough edges, in all aspects, from the technical to the artistic. The graphics are a brave attempt but still look very amature, and the writing tends to oscillate between trying too hard and trying so little that glaring grammatical errors are left unchecked.\n\nThat said, I have not regretted the hour I spent on the island. Think of this game as an early short story by a promising author who hasn't mastered his craft yet. I can't in good conscience call it a good game, but I would urge anyone who's still curious to play it anyway.\n\nFor what it's worth, the developer's next game, "The Music Machine" is a clear improvement, visually stunning, narratively tighter and set within the same universe, exploring similar themes. If you're going to give David Szymanski only one try, maybe starting there would be a safer bet.","October 31, 2015","false","2.7"," 25 of 30 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","25","30","0","7"

If you can take the information presented and arrange it properly, the story still flushes out nicely.\n\nI was hard pressed to slam on the shift button every time I felt like a long hallway was in need of a sprint button. The lack of sprinting made the game drag out a bit longer than was absolutely necessary. For a game that boasts in the beginning of taking an hour long, it certainly holds to it because you'll spend half of that time staring at every single book on the wall just to read another paragraph of text and the other half walking down hallways, unsure of whether or not you should turn your flashlight off.\n\nDespite this, the game played well. Ever since the game dipped into its horror side, I felt chilled and uneasy the entire time. The progression from day to night was flawless, although getting to the final area in flashlight-repressing darkness was a challenge from the Chapel. I'm thankful the game is only worth about $2 or so because if I paid any more I'd be complaining that there wasn't enough content to be worth the price. As it stands, The Moon Sliver has a very interesting story that could be expanded upon in a sequel (or prequel, because  everyone dies  ). The game is worth the price tag but not the time spent to complete it. There's a lot of character development to characters that you don't get to meet, but that might be on purpose because,  until the final level, it's very unclear which character you play as.  The ending explains why you've been mucking about on a deserted island well enough, but I get the sense that the final moments were the entire point of the game and everything prior to it was just narrative filler.\n\nFor a $2 game, I'd give it a good 5/5 stars.

It's not really a game and I would even hesitate to classify it as an interactive novel. It's really more like an artistic experience. The story is interesting enough to keep you engaged, the writing is good, and while the graphics aren't exactly top quality, they're good enough for what The Moon Sliver is. Sound and atmosphere are where this 'game' excel. I came into this having already played and enjoyed Fingerbones and while The Moon Sliver lacks the impact its predecessor had, it's still decently unnerving and unsettling.\n\nThat said, there are enough problems with The Moon Sliver that make it impossible for me to justify its purchase.\n\nThe first would be the length. The game's title screen suggests you set aside an hour to play it through from beginning to end (as there is no save system and it is intended to be played in a single setting; I'll get to that in a second). It took me less than half that. That is a ludicrously short play time for a game with no replayability for the current asking price (or even the discounted price I paid during a sale).\n\nThe second is a pair of questionable technical choices on the part of the developer. The lack of a save system was not a good choice. It could be argued that it was done to maintain the atmosphere throughout the entire experience, but a well crafted game should never need to hold its audience hostage to maintain its atmosphere. The other troubling technical choice was the need to recharge the flashlight batteries. There's just no purpose to it; it's a tedious, unnecessary complication that detracts rather than adds to the experience of the game.\n\nThe last issue I had was with the story. I said earlier that the story was interesting and it is. The problem is that there is no resolution to it. Too many questions are left unanswered, too much of the world that's been introduced is left unexplored. And while the game leaves you clues to inference some things on your own, there's just not enough to paint a complete picture.\n\nThe bottom line: there's just not enough here to make it worth the price. Highly disappointing.\n3/10","November 2, 2014","false","0.6"," 18 of 29 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","18","29","0","0"

It really IS creepy, immersive, atmospheric. Yes, it holds the interest of the "participant". I don't say "player" because this is only vaguely a game, though I mean nothing negative by that. There are items to find, things to solve, documents to read. But since, seemingly, it only proceeds once these occurances take place, it is a particularly linear one hour.\n\nThe Moon Sliver, like most things of man,  is best described by comparisons. My first feeling, which only grew throughout, was Bergman's "Hour of the Wolf", a fabulous, trendsetting black and white film, and one of the first art/horror films (in my experience) to use special effects specifically to disorient the viewer. TMS is also strongly Lovecraft, and that is territory I've held dear for over four decades. And substantially Merhige's "Begotten", in sound and sight. Its starkness brings to mind many Russian films, significantly Tarkovsky's mind-blowing "Stalker". Very much (perhaps too much) a much more recent American film that you will recognize immediately upon the ending of the story, and then strongly throughout in retrospect. "Homage" is too kind a word. Regrettably for this review, this film's name would go beyond spoiler and significantly complete the story.\n\nThe focus is on four named people who have become very close during their time living on an island. Remembered conversations and various personal memories keep the story proceeding and mysteriously ambiguous at the same time. They also tend to distract, thereby keeping disbelief suspended. For this participant that was the most difficult aspect of this story. In some context this whole experience seems less like a completed project, and more like an well thought out, extremely long trailer for a full-blown game concept being explored for popularity and feasibility.\n\nMuch of the allure of this game is that it goes one step beyond perma-death (when did that term NOT become redundant), and is a no-save game to be completed in one sitting. The premise is that the island of the story has a long history, and is now sinking. A population once numerous has been, for some reason to be determined, reduced to one. Some mysterious form of industry or commerce reduced to unidentifiable, rusting remnants. There are no roads and no boats. No television or computers, though power comes from far off through power lines and towers, presumably traveling SO far across the water as to make escape an impracticality. What strains credibiliy beyond the power source (if possible) is that the island could have possibly sunk enough to be so tiny, and still have supported a wood burning community. (EDIT: Having begun The Music Machine, I now realize that the size of the island was stylized, not literal. Please consider everything in this paragraph in that context. Thank you.) More likely, the backstory and one-hour life are not so much plot devices, as reasons to keep the island small and easy to create, and the story simple without the need to answer questions either within or outside the story. Being told at the opening "When night falls, enter the mountain.", then being denied entry despite the deepest possible blackness of night is far too clearly a means of communicating non-completion of some task, and seems contrived at both ends.\n\nIf one ignores all, with the exception of the wind and darkness, isolation and fear, this is a very nice, intensely creepy story to partake in. (Though with minimal replayability.) If one can get this title for a reasonable price, considering the length, I think most people will be satisfied that it absolutely does deliver everything it promises. Play it in the dark.....\n\n(Gametime, as with many Steam games, is not tracked offline.)\n\n(4CZ)","April 27, 2015","true","0.2"," 14 of 22 people (64%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","64","14","22","2","1"

An interactive narrative, a stroll-em-up, a walking simulator, whatever, the point is that it's atmospheric and tells a more than competent story.\n\nThe Moon Sliver takes a novel approach to its story telling. You enter the world not knowing anything about what's going on, but it soon becomes apparent that you're on a small, doomed island and the population have disappeared. As you explore the handful of abandoned buildings you'll discover paraphernalia that you can click on, filling part of the screen with text. As you move around the room the text will fade being replaced with new text you've discovered. The story is deliberately vague, but by walking around the room in the right way you can at least piece together the order it's supposed to be read in.\n\nApart from one, arguably 2 puzzles, the only other gameplay mechanic is your torch, which has the battery life of a Game Gear. You have to keep charging it at one of the outlets otherwise it will flicker and die. You need the torch to see where you're going, and yes, the repeated need to charge it does its job of adding tension, but it feels a little cheap.\n\nGraphics don't make a game, or they shouldn't, but there's no denying they can help. The Moon Sliver isn't an expensive game, it wasn't made by a big team, so that it isn't jaw dropping is both understandable and forgivable, but it is to its detriment. The game looks desolate, as it's supposed to, but not always in a good way. Buildings look simplistic, the barren plains a little too barren, and interiors are almost completely empty. There’s little in the way of texture work, the same features are repeated, and environmental effects are limited. Dear Esther worked largely because it looked cold, empty and uninhabited, the evocative moments punched harder because they looked so picturesque. It may be unfair to compare to two, but Dear Esther is indicative of where The Moon Sliver doesn’t work, it doesn’t convince you of its world, it doesn’t take you there.\n\nStill though it does tell a good story, and despite all the odds it The Moon Sliver does get tense. The uncertainty and the change of environment, it works, and it’s all set up by the narrative. The music doesn’t quite flow as smoothly as it should, you can hear the moment it clicks back to the start, but it’s tonally perfect, foreboding. The Moon Sliver is worth your time, and it’s cheap enough that it’s probably worth the gamble if you fancy a narrative experience. You do get the feeling that if the developer (David Szymanski) took another stab at this in another couple of years (or his previous game, the surprising and dark Fingerbones) they’d see a huge improvement, but what’s there is still a game that stayed in my thoughts for a few days\n","November 9, 2014","true","3.6"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

While sometimes called "walking simulators," there is more interaction in this than something like Dear Esther.  Priced appropriately for its approximately 1 hour run time (55 minutes in my case), it's a moody, intriguing experience and a decent recommendation for players who are inclined to like this sort of game and have their expectations in check.\n\nOver the course of the game, players explore a desolate island, encountering story snippets that help piece together what has happened. While the island is small, players can go where they please, though certain things must be discovered, and a few minor puzzles solved, before they can progress.\n\nThe writing was interesting, and struck a good balance between giving the player snippets of dialogue that allow them to piece together what's happened, but not so little that nothing makes sense. I thought the quality of the writing was professional and evocative. It also avoided being too wordy, being economical with words and then getting out of the way to let the player's imagination do the rest.\n\nWhile the island's graphics are unimpressive to behold at first, the transition to night makes great use of sound and atmospheric effects.  The audio in the chapel and the tunnels was excellent and moody. Overall, the game's atmosphere won me over for the most part, despite the poor visual quality.  Ironically, it's at night, or in the lightless interior segments, where the visuals shine.\n\nThe Moon Sliver is recommended for those looking to spend a few bucks for an hour spent discovering the interesting fiction crafted by the designer.\n\nEdit: To do my little part for games critique (and comply with the new Steam subscriber agreement), I should disclose that the key for this game was given to me by the developer.  Did this affect my judgement?  Perhaps, though looking back I think maintain that it was a pleasanat little game that wasn't very long, nor was it asking for very much money.

I also found out that the same developer made 'Fingerbones' and, while not my favourite game, also had a good sense of loneliness that this game had. The music was also decent. I actually regret not buying it while the game was on sale, but that's only because I like soundtracks.\n\nSaying anything about the story itself would go straight into spoiler territory, mainly due to how short the game is.

Now, I can't help but compare it to those who went before, and, in the context of the exceptional Dear Esther, it's hard not to see The Moon Sliver as Dear Esther Lite.  It is shorter, it has less polished graphics, it has text overlays but no narration, and it has a story which, while it is definitely interesting, lacks the many layers of its predecessor.\n\nIs it worth playing?  Certainly, especially at this price - for a couple of dollars you get what is by design a mysterious vignette that takes about an hour to play through, and also get to show your support for storytelling of this kind.\n\nHowever if you go into it expecting the next great walk-'em-up you will find the lack of polish confronting and distracting.  The piece is certainly competent, but it is not exceptional.  The ambient sounds and music are apt, but fairly generic.  The story is told in location-triggered text overlays which sometimes overlap each other, making them hard to read.  The mechanic of the torch running out of battery and needing to be recharged periodically would work in a horror game like Slender, but in this context, where there is mood, definitely, but no danger, the torch recharging is a distraction from your progression, causing you to have to backtrack several times, which can break your immersion when this causes previous set text displays to reappear, this time in reverse.  Little details like this detract only very little from the story, but you will certainly notice them.  The Moon Sliver feels like someone's Game Design final project rather than a commercial release, although understand I mean that less as a criticism and more as a recognition that the game is endearing.  It's not overlong, it manages to avoid being very pretentious, it does what it sets out to do, and what it sets out to do is take an hour of your time and make you wonder what happened on this island.\n\nBeyond the flashlight there are two aspects of the game I found a little weak.  One is that there is a hatch at one point, behind which is a lot of story, but which can only be opened by guessing the door code.  Unless I missed something (Yep!  I did miss something.  Thanks to crasowl for giving me the heads up that the code is indeed quite easy to find in the game; that one's on me, I just missed it, no excuses) at no point do you learn the code, it is purely guesswork.  It's not hard to guess, but it feels odd to go to the effort of placing a keypad only to not give the player any way to know the key, and then place important story behind it.  The second is that in order to progress you need to 'wait until night', and even wandering around enjoying the atmosphere and the art, I had finished exploring every nook of the island long before night fell, and had to idle my game for about twenty minutes waiting for the next part.  This isn't great for immersion.\n\nWhy am I spending so long detailing minor gripes like this in a game that is both very short and which I have recommended?  Because if you know about these little things before you play, the story and the atmosphere of the game are such that you may still really enjoy your brief time on the island.  It is only if you expect a long, polished narrative experience that you might be disappointed.\n\nFor what it is - a short, intriguing, rudimentary, mysterious story-game - The Moon Sliver is charming and engaging, and deserves support.","November 3, 2014","true","1.2"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","2"

The "unfinished" feeling gets reinforced with the soundtrack (available as a DLC) because it is conformed by six pieces that does not even contain iD3 tags nor relevant information, and even worse, each one is "cut" at the end abruptly.\n\nGraphics are pretty basic for todays standards, I would compare them to those present on Quake I, or even simpler than that, but that's not a disadvantage at all given the style of the game. I would recommend playing "The Music Machine" instead, it's by far a much better approach to this type of games despite its simplicity.\n\nI would say even a game as old as "Samorost I" gives you a more fulfilling, satisfying and professional experience.\n\nPROS:\n- It's cheap.\n- Steam Trading Cards.\n\nCONS:\n- Subpar experience.\n- Feels like an unfinished, unpolished work.\n- Hollow history.","April 13","false","10.7"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Turns out it was error on Valve's part as the game wasn't inteded to be that cheap.  Suffice to say, after finishing the game at half an hour (30 minutes short from the expected time), I could definitely say this discounted price value is exactly its worth.\n\nAs someone who considers Gone Home as 2013 GOTY, I am definitely in tune with the so-called interactive novels (aka: walking simulators) but this is a game that relies too much on interpretation that the novelty of the interactive aspect is diminished.  The game has an unnecessary gameplay cue such as recharging your flashlight which ends up adding tedium to the already lacking of a sprint button; to which certain moments in the game would have you backtracking if you ever miss some parts.\n\nThere is but 2 puzzles (1 with guesswork) in the game and it does certainly disrupts the flow of the narrative especially if you were given the free ability to explore how you wish.  However, the game's short nature justifies the entire experience as you are left wondering what "The Moon Sliver" is and its intended purpose.  Anymore would be already in spoiler territory so I leave it to you to make what you have.\n\nClearly, this is game with an interesting storyline but to charge for it is asking for too much.  I can only recommend this when the price goes back to the 70% range again.","October 31, 2014","false","0.5"," 19 of 33 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","19","33","0","0"

It is very short, and with such a modest asking price it is not a very big investment of time or money. But boy does it pay off.  I beat the game in well under an hour, but I haven't stopped thinking about it since. The horror in this game is not the kind that says "boo" and you chuckle about it later. It crawls over you like a rising tide, and your desire to know more about the narrative is challenged by your growing sense of dread. Luckily for me, my desire to complete the game won, and I was very moved by a narrative that is simple, but is told in such a powerful way, and actually leaves you with questions that the game doesn't answer for you. Obviously I love this game, but if your the kind of person who says that narrative/exploration games are not really games due to their lack of gameplay, you'll for sure have the same problem with this game. If that doesn't bug you, do yourself a favor and buy this game, it is truly excellent, and look how cheap it is!","October 30, 2014","true","1.0"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

So short that it took me about 35 minutes to complete with only a couple of parts missed out (optional info that tells you more in relation to the story). This doesn't mean it's terrible however. No game should be judged primarily on its length, but understandably this will put people off paying for it.\nSecondly, it's not a sandbox, nor does it have levels, skilltrees, gun mods or anything like that. It's in an incredibly similar style to the mod/indie game 'Dear Esther'. I enjoyed Dear Esther very much, which is why I grabbed a copy of this in the first place, but if you're not a fan of just walking, looking and listening then it might not be the game for you.\n\nThe game is creepy, at least in my opinion. Not in a spine-chilling, survival horror kind of way, but more in a "What happened here?!" kind of way. You're a resident of a deserted island that consists of nothing more than a short mountain, a small abandoned settlement and some underground tunnels. As you analyse objects and enter certain areas, you'll learn about the various ex-members of the island's community via a series of text boxes. I like a game that forces you to read rather than listen, so this wasn't a bad thing for me, however I did start to tire of the boxes fading in and out in transparency every time I moved further or nearer to the objects that generated them.\n\nGraphically, I can't quite call it beautiful, but it has a weird sort of prettiness to it. The visuals ever so slightly remind me of the point and click puzzle classic, Myst, in that it's relatively bleak yet still colourful in it's own right. The textures and shadows aren't what you'd describe as impressive, but again have their own style of charm, and are more than enough that's necessary for this particular game, should you choose to describe it as that.\n\nThe sound effects are a little bit dull, but the droning, atmospheric, ambient soundtrack that bobs in and out of the story's progression sounds great. It's very well fitting for this type of story, puts you on edge from time to time, and adds a thin, but satisfactory level of tension and fear.\n\nThe ending (don't worry, there are no spoilers) didn't quite wow me, but it was very nicely done and was a fitting end to what turned out to be a chilling, mysterious tale.\n\nI enjoyed The Moon Silver all in all and would recommend it to those that love to explore desolate, post-apocalyptic like environments. Those of you that enjoy a nice mystery would enjoy it also, as it takes a little bit of thinking here and there to figure out the order of events. I would, however, NOT recommend it to those that prefer to have a lot of options, weapons, inventory screens etc. This is a fairly simple game designed purely to tell a story. 7/10.","November 1, 2014","true","0.7"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

The dev is a great writer, and is able to give you a sense of fear phycologically which is an art in itself; however, considering this game was made by unity in the most barebones way possilbe is dissapointing. I am currently developing a walking simulator type game and thought to give this game a try. Figuring it uses the engine I am using, and is in this type of genre. Here are the pros and cons.\n\nPros:\n1. Great Writing.\n2. Wonderful music, though I wish there was a little more variation\n3. The feeling that it was tyring to draw out of the player while experienceing it.\n\nCons:\n1. Obvious lack of time on developing it. Yes, I know this isn't a consumer issue. Anyone who has dealt with Unity, even a little, will be able to see what you did. I can describe how you developed your game in just possible 2 paragraphs.\n2. This ties in to Pro #2. Lack of music variation though the music sets the tone.\n3. Bad level placement desicions. The water able to walk on? Along with electrical poles and such in the water? Is this hell or something?\n4. The dev tested little to none.\n5. Lack of game playablitly. I was able to complete this game within just 15 minutes. Sorry son, you need more to be asking for that price.\n\nSo do I like this game, and would I recommend it? Yes, I would. Though this game does have more flaws than pros, I still appreciate what the dev was shooting for. Who would've thought that amazing loop playing music and simple line of texts to read would give you sense of lonliness anyway. I just hope the next game this guy works on will have him invest a little bit more into the game (cash wise) for us consumers to get more out of it.","October 29, 2014","true","0.4"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","0"

The labyrinthine storage section is frustrating and ugly to look at.\n\nWith a good narrative this might have been salvaged, but unfortunately it doesn't have the same writing quality of superior games like Ether One or A Machine for Pigs. The fragmented narrative can get frustrating to deal with and the characters aren't really well-developed enough to hold any emotional investment. The premise was interesting enough to hold my attention, though.\n\nI honestly hate writing negative reviews for one-man indie games but this was just too lazily put together to ignore.

A better description might be something more like visual, interactive fiction. Where The Moon Sliver shines is the storytelling, which is done in an incredibly creative way that is largely non-linear. And I definitely got the heebies playing this late at night (though I'm easily scared).\nSomeone reviewing this program as a "game" is likely to give it a lower score than it necessarily deserves, but a player who doesn't go in expecting a gameplay experience is likely to enjoy the experience for what it is, and enjoy it a lot more.\nMy one criticism is that the maps in the underground section were not terribly imaginative.

So if you don't want to spend a lot of time with a short story in a manner of Steven King fantasy, you're good with this game.\nThe music was mildly unsettling/eerie and fitting the overall tone of the game, while at the same time put in good spots (I only wish there was a bit more of that ambience in more places and sometimes the quality of the background just didn't measure up with other tracks).\nFinally I like how there were no achievements added to the game. You don't want to play it to go out of your way to break it, you just experience the story.\n\nThe bad:The comparison to Steven King hurts, because the writing is not nearly as good. There's a lot of stuff left open and I have no idea what all this crap was all about. You don't get any feeling of the pieces being left out making it more poetic or free for your own interpretation, half the time it's just, like, "What, really?" The text snippets popping up are just clumsy and written without any heart. If you make a story-centered game, please keep track of the writing. Have someone read it, judge it and clean out all the typos. Indie authors can do that, you wouldn't be the first. The story by itself is mildly interesting but didn't blow me away at all. It's very depressing, yes, but I miss the deep psychology other reviewers saw completely. Maybe I wasn't in the right mood for it but I found stories like those of "Gone Home" much more approachable than this. The final thing is: Why is it never said who you really are? I mean, you are playing one of the four people of the island but you're not allowed to know whom? I correctly guessed it after twenty minutes anyway, so it's not a big loss, but what's the point?\nAlso, the graphics are not good. I know it's an indie game using textures from Devian Art but there is a special kind of non-understanding needed to misplace some of the textures as horribly as was done here, e.g. those so-called barrels look horrible, more like drainage pipes made of some very pixelated kind of wood. The flash light looks horrible. I don't know why the cone of light is never changing shape, no matter where I point it. Also it only keeps running for 2 minutes or so which kind of seems unneccessary for a exploration game. At some point in the game the day turns to night and it's one of those nights where you don't see ♥♥♥♥. Well, it somehow fits the story in the end, but then please give me the ability to take more than one flash light. I'm not carrying anything else, do I?\nFinally I wanted to complain about the design choices a little bit. There are -- if I recall correctly -- eight different houses accessible in the game, but somehow seven of them look pretty much the same. Sometimes the furniture changed a little bit and the wall texture is different, but all in all it's always the same one-room bulding. Doesn't make for a lot of exploratory fun when you always see the same. Also, the text snippets are hidden at completely random places during the game. Of course you want to look for super-important hints in empty drainage-pipe barrels and empty chairs.\nThe bits important for progress (which really is just one bit of text, I think) is on the other hand placed sensibly. Then again the design of one of the tunnels is completely insane. It's supposed to be a storage tunnel but it is just an empty dark labyrinth. It has a bunch of lights at the ceiling, but of course there is no switch to be found. Instead you run again stupidly to ever-same-texture tunnels, never knowing when there's a turn because the cone of the flash light always has the same shape. Fun.\nFinally, the music that was placed good is scarce. Most of the time you just hear the stupid wind blasting over the island with an everlasting sandstorm (which is kind of unreasonable since the whole island is only spanning twenty seconds of walking). I wish the developer spent more time on finding more of this well-placed music to increase immersion and the eerie atmosphere he established so well in other parts.\n\nThe verdict:The idea was fun at first, but running around clueless for thirty minutes made the story less enjoyable. The whole story didn't really unfold as beautifully as it could have and you don't get enough information at all to really understand what's happening or has already happened. Once I knew how to solve this one puzzle that held me back the story ended within ten minutes and very abruptly at that. Along with only 'meh' graphics and a lot of bland text to read I can not really recommend the game. It could've been a lot better with more care about textures, sound and better writing. But if you can overlook those things and don't have to think "aw, this could've been so much better" all the time you might just be good with an hour of entertainment. If not sure, you just need to consider if it's worth three USD or not.","December 2, 2014","false","1.2"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

If you are likeminded, its definately worth picking up The Moon Sliver.\n\nThe graphics aren't incredible and the controls are very simple, but that all adds to the charm, and to a certain extent, the creeepiness of the game. The Moon Sliver is saying more through less as its the lack of entities that make it such a chilling piece of work. I'm unsure as to whether this is as a result of a lack of time or resources from the author, or whether this was intended to be so, but either way it works terrifically well.\n\nAs you can see, it took me roughly an hour to complete the game. I have more to say about playing The Moon Sliver after 60 minutes, than I do about some horror games that I have invested 10 hours into.

I would only suggest that the investigate symbols were larger when popping up next to items/doors.\n\nif you enjoy open world exploration, psychological stuff and almost melancholy/apocalyptic conversations and characters and situations, recommend this game!!!!

Requiesta de Silencia","http://steamcommunity.com/id/UncrownedPrince91/","242 products in account","This game is similar to Dear Esther and Gone Home but with a bit of a graphical downgrade (poor water textures, less stunningly beautiful terrains). Where the game shines is in its story, but where it fails is in gameplay.\n\nThe story is very deep with a lot of twists and turns. It's a fun game to play just to see if you can guess what actually happened by piecing it together yourself!\n\nThe gameplay is padded. One of dear ester and gone home's strongest points was their linearity. Having us explore to find that one, tiny little file that we didn't notice before we can continue onwards is just dragging out the gameplay. This should have been more linear and less exploration.\n\nIt was tagged psychological horror, but I don't think it's that scary. Once you notice that your shift key doesn't make you run, all the psychological horror drains out immediately for me.\n\nI can't say the game is really worth $2.99 to me, but if you're more focused on story than on gameplay it's probably worth it to you.

Even those of us who don't expect ten hours of gameplay per dollar we spend should probably wait for a sale, 'cause it's DANG SHORT.  I'm also not going to recommend it to anyone who doesn't enjoy READING, nor anyone who expects anything vaguely resembling ACTION.  Still here?  Okay, let's examine it a little closer then...\n\nDespite being one of those people who VERY much believes in the notion of "experimental storytelling" in video games, I must say this one's pushing it's luck a little.  A short story format may well have served the tale being told here better than a "game"; which, even by my own broad definition, this only BARELY qualifies as.  Gone Home, on the other hand, NEEDED to be a game, and would have made an appallingly ♥♥♥♥ "read" in and of itself...why was this so?  Well, simply put, it was a game where you had to explore a defined area, discover clues as to what had happened there, and gradually piece the story together.  The Moon Sliver operates on much the same principle, EXCEPT...the area you explore is much, much smaller, and the vast majority of the "clues" are given not so much as real-time items which you can find and interpret the meaning of as you see fit, but rather as literary passages which represent memories of, I assume, the character you are playing.  In that sense, perhaps, it's also quite a bit like Dear Esther, but again...even THAT game was longer and arguably more substantial in the information it ultimately delivers than this one.\n\nWhich isn't to say that The Moon Sliver doesn't create an atmosphere, or is completely lacking in game "mechanics".  Quite to the contrary, it actually has one "mechanic" which was so prominent as to be almost obtrusive and annoying at times...which is to say, that while trying to keep one's flashlight fully charged was an essential part of the SUSPENSE of a game like Outlast, it's mostly just an IRRITATION in this game...especially when your primary light source starts flickering in the middle of a climactic, night-time wind-storm, during which you have to find your way to a specific location with ♥♥♥♥-all visibility.  In my opinion, the game would have been plenty atmospheric enough with a fully-functional flashlight throughout...but then again, after all the flak which the second Amnesia caught on account of its severely stripped-down "mechanics", one can't really blame designers for playing it safe and throwing one or two (however unnecessary) "gameplay" elements in there, certainly right at this point in time.\n\nThe Moon Sliver definitely tells an interesting story - though one which, I imagine, will only "blow the mind" of people who haven't read too many horror and/or science-fiction short stories - and it tells its tale well enough, within the confines of how it chooses to do so.  It's only the chosen medium and the price-tag which I'm really querying, not the talent involved.  I definitely look forward to future games from the chap who made this, I just hope that he'll get more ambitious and more realistic about market values from here on in.  Imagine how many more people would give this a shot - and with a little luck, be pleasantly surprised! - if it were being given away for free or for something as negligible as, say, zero dollars and ninety-nine cents.  Wait for a sale, and enter with an open mind, and you just may get that small but pleasant surprise after all, in spite of all the reservations I've just expressed.  A very nice "demo", but I'm still reluctant to qualify it as a fully-fledged product/game.\n\nVerdict: 7.5/10.","November 3, 2014","true","0.9"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

This is exactly how I feel about The Moon Sliver. This game has few, if any, redeeming qualities.\nThe 'story' (after all, that's what you play this kind of game for) consists of barely three pages' worth of vague and uninspired writing with a lot of typos. The plot is little more than a big, stale metaphor without sense or closure.\nThe entire presentation was cobbled together from public domain assets. The music isn't particularly well made, but it gets the job done, I guess. The sound design is barely existent, so let's not talk about that. The graphics, however... Calling them lackluster would be a praise. Every beginning visual artist could manage better than this with at least a little effort.\nFor a beginning hobbyist's first project, this may be OK - clearly, the author has mastered the basics of Unity. With years of training, perhaps he can create something that actually has potential. But putting this hastily pieced together project up for sale on Steam is an insult to anyone who is stupid enough to buy it.\nBut then again, The Moon Sliver could just be a very elaborate attempt at trolling.

It's the kind of quiet creepiness that I really value in a game, with enough tension in places that I actually jumped out of my skin a couple of times (just from ambient noises, and once from a noise in my own house!).\n\nThey recommend having about an hour to play it start to finish, and my playthrough clocked in at 50 minutes, so I was right on "schedule" for completion; this was with me poking into every single corner of the island, and I'm sure I managed to miss a few things.\n\nI'm honestly not sure what I think of the plot itself; it was unique and unfolded in a compelling way, but now a day or so after finishing the game, I'm still not sure what I think of it.  The gameplay and unique aspects of the game completely eclipse any skepticism of the plotwriting itself, though, so I'm going to recommend the game anyway.\n\nAll in all, $2.99 for an entertaining hour of game is worth it to me.  When deciding to purchase, bear in mind that it is a walking-simulator-styled game, with no combat.  It is entirely exploration based, with the occasional need to recharge your flashlight.  If that's not your kind of thing, you'll want to bypass this one.  If, however, you're new to the genre and want an inexpensive "trial run" of the game style, I'd say give it a shot.","January 4, 2015","true","0.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's pushing to do a 3D atmospheric interactive art piece, much like Dear Esther, but the problem is, it fails to hit all the marks.   Where DE had nice graphics, audio, all the elements tying together to create a convincing, if somewhat desolate and depressing story, The Moon Sliver fails on all counts.\n\nThe graphics are clumsy and woeful, the story is uninteresting and just gets spammed at you through chunks of text (I think the developer originally wanted to write a novel but couldn't come up with enough pages).\n\nI should have recognised the Unity brand of shame as soon as the game launched.

There is no real objective other than to uncover the story. It plays out in a few short sections that can last between 10 - 20 minutes. The scenery will change and that will be your notification that the game has moved forward. The controls are as responsive as you will need them to be.\nThe visuals in this game are acceptable for what this game is. It does enough and purely enough, nothing flashy or special. The issue I had was that the writing gave me a different sense in this game from what the visuals sometimes portray. A few scenes will reach out and touch you in a visual sense but they are the exceptions.\nI did enjoy the soundtrack. It is the majority of where the ambient mood comes from. It will help you when you begin to feel disconnected from the visuals.\nThe writing and the story are done well and with a certain emotion that makes up for the vagueness. The metaphysical journey it takes you on is filled with a certain trepidation, wonder, and confusion. It is a fantastic enjoyable tale.\nThe mechanics are a little clunky as the text you are meant to read will sometimes overlap making it impossible to read. The point and click also has the potential to annoy and distract from the other excellent portions of the game.\nThe game can potentially be replayed to gather more intrigue into the story and nature of the surreal place and its inhabitants. An excellent way to kill an hour getting lost in a story that has the proper amount of vagueness to get your imagination rolling.\n\nWould Recommend! 8 / 10","February 8, 2015","true","1.2"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

I refer to them as 'David Szymanski' games because they each have the strong sense of his particular narrative taste and design choices. His games are minimalist in graphic design, but present the player with some of the strongest atmosphere I've experienced. Combined with the writing and the musical score, The Moon Sliver is nothing short of a master work from a very talented designer. This game provided me with what is probably my favorite moment of any horror style game I've played to date. I did exactly what the game wanted me to do, and the designer had me exactly where he wanted me to be, right before delivering one of the most powerful moments I've had in a narrative  based game. Highest marks, and highly recommended even when not on sale. David deserves his money for these experiences.\n\n*I've played each of David's designs, and highly recommend them for those who are seeking an experience that is more than just a game, but an exploration of horror narrative, and how a game can be more than just an entertainment piece.

This is a short game that doesn't involve much beyond walking around to gather information so you can piece together the basic story.  The game says it's intended to be played in one sitting, so there's no save system, and I finished it in about 45 minutes.  It seems like some things have to be done before others in order to advance the story, but for the most part it's not that hard to figure that out.  Overall, the story wasn't bad (though it was told in pieces), and the music and scenery was generally good.  But it's so short with so little to actually do, that it wasn't as enjoyable as I had hoped.  I don't see a lot of replay value here either.  Playing it again from the start after knowing what comes later could make the story clearer, but whether you want to do that will likely depend on how much you enjoyed the story.  My opinion here is kind of neutral -- it's not a bad game and exploring the island and story is a nice way to kill some time, but it is quite short without much to do.  You're looking at $3 for 1 hour of game play, tops, which isn't exactly a great value IMO.  I'm glad I picked this up in a bundle and would suggest that you try to get it on sale if you want to play it.","November 25, 2014","true","0.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

It's short, yet still manages to convey more atmosphere than many longer titles I know. The island you find yourself on embodies a feeling of loneliness and decay. Exposition is mainly done through text boxes and journals, but in a way that draws you in to the mythology and story of the game. The music is top quality, though sparse, and helps build tension. The story is actually surprisingly deep, as I discovered while messing around during my second playthrough. HEAVY STORY-RELATED SPOILERS FOLLOW\n\nIt's heavily implied that Abel, by destroying the Moon Sliver and freeing the Woodland Teeth, is actually doing the right thing all along. In the storage tunnels, there is a locked hatch, but no code is given in the game. However, via trial and error, this hatch can be opened. Inside is a room, seemingly burned, with text that speaks of a truth that Hector would not tell, and scraps of paper that truth was written on.\n\nSuddenly, Abel's ramblings at the end of the game make sense. The Moon Sliver is a lie, set up by Hector along with the Chapel.  "Let your prosperity on this island be a sign that the words I speak are true" says the Moon. But the island is no paradise; indeed it is falling into ruin, a hell. The Woodland Teeth, a spirit of the forest, merely frees you from this hell.\n\nNote, that if this interpretation is correct, Isa and Abel share an even more tragic fate. As Daniel, Ellie, and Abel were all taken by the Woodland Teeth, they have now escaped the island, and are in a better place. However, Isa kills herself in the tunnels beneath the mountain, believing the word of Hector. These two lovers are apart even in death.\n\nRegardless of your interpretation, this game is worth a second look, and for only $3 is a real bargain. Buy this game and enjoy!","October 29, 2014","true","1.8"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

It's not bad or anything, but there's just not enough substance to it for it to be really good or bad, so I can't really recommend actually buying it individually.

I  liked Dear Esther and I was hoping this would be the same.

I'm happy with the minimal interaction, and weak puzzles but only if it's a good mystery with plenty of interesting places to explore.  I don't think this game qualifies on either of those points. Good novelty value.  Not replayable (unless you rush through to the end then have to replay to find out what it was all about).\nI'm hovering between recommending it and not recommending it.\nIf you want a good island adventure I'd recommend Miasmata.  If you want something that delivers an emotional impact that continues to make you think for a few weeks afterwards I'd recommend Dear Esther.  If you want to be entertained with something a bit different for 45 minutes or so, I'd recommend The Moon Sliver.","October 29, 2014","true","0.8"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","6","12","0","0"

With the narrative told via snippets of text that appear as you enter areas it can sometimes be a little annoying if you enter an area more than once or twice, but when the overall story comes together it the method really works. It's a great game that manages to do more with what little it has than a lot of games attempt (and often fail) to do with more vast resources.

There is a supernatural story here, and a powerful one - but the details are left to your interpretation. This game is short (and rightly so for this type of work). But it rewards exploration. I don't know what the minimal set of steps required to finish the game are, but you shouldn't worry about them. Wander the island, and events will progress at their own pace. As you revisit old locations, parts of the story which you had read before will make more sense, or suddenly tie into information found elsewhere.\n\nThe art is minimal but evocative. It actually reminded me of older 3d games, where the shapes you see on screen act as suggestions to your imagination, rather than attempts at photorealism. I've come away from The Moon Sliver feeling like I know the island on which it's set like a real place. The developer gets extra credits for evidently having done most of it on a  shoestring. The taste and care in the assets used is a triumph in itself.\n\nDownsides? The developer felt the need to to include two very silly game-y elements.\n\nThe first is a torch with batteries that run out after a couple of minutes and have to be recharged. I'm not sure if this adds to the atmosphere of the darker sections, but it certainly adds to the mood-breaking annoyance. I sense that the developer felt the silliness of this mechanic, because the game is littered with recharging points, and recharging is an instant operation.\n\nThe second is two instances of a very simple lock puzzle, which feel like vestiges of a previous design when maybe this game was more puzzle-oriented. I will improve your experience of the game by telling you now that there is no technique for these, you just have to guess - but there's so few options that it's the work of seconds to do so.\n\nNeither of these impair  a brilliant short narrative experience. Score out of ten: yes do play it.","October 31, 2014","true","0.9"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","1"

There is a supernatural story here, and a powerful one - but the details are left to your interpretation. This game is short (and rightly so for this type of work). But it rewards exploration. I don't know what the minimal set of steps required to finish the game are, but you shouldn't worry about them. Wander the island, and events will progress at their own pace. As you revisit old locations, parts of the story which you had read before will make more sense, or suddenly tie into information found elsewhere.\n\nThe art is minimal but evocative. It actually reminded me of older 3d games, where the shapes you see on screen act as suggestions to your imagination, rather than attempts at photorealism. I've come away from The Moon Sliver feeling like I know the island on which it's set like a real place. The developer gets extra credits for evidently having done most of it on a  shoestring. The taste and care in the assets used is a triumph in itself.\n\nDownsides? The developer felt the need to to include two very silly game-y elements.\n\nThe first is a torch with batteries that run out after a couple of minutes and have to be recharged. I'm not sure if this adds to the atmosphere of the darker sections, but it certainly adds to the mood-breaking annoyance. I sense that the developer felt the silliness of this mechanic, because the game is littered with recharging points, and recharging is an instant operation.\n\nThe second is two instances of a very simple lock puzzle, which feel like vestiges of a previous design when maybe this game was more puzzle-oriented. I will improve your experience of the game by telling you now that there is no technique for these, you just have to guess - but there's so few options that it's the work of seconds to do so.\n\nNeither of these impair  a brilliant short narrative experience. Score out of ten: yes do play it.","October 31, 2014","true","0.9"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","1"

The intro recommends setting aside an hour, but I finished it in less that that, so bear that in mind before you buy.\n\nI would have liked it to be longer and I'm curious about the world it's set in. Maybe there will be more in this universe, but probably not... because even in that short time this game is packed full of story. Through snippets of memory and notes and implications a full world is created. Added to the high quality graphics (and sounds!) this creates a wonderful atmosphere. This is almost more of an experience than a game, and the gameplay itself is extremely basic - but that seems to be an enhancing factor. Everything is so stark and streamlined, and the gameplay style absolutely fits the atmosphere.\n\nHonestly, it feels more like a skills showcase than a true game (the graphics are stark, but lovely  when you're outside) because it's so brief, but I still loved it and will be on the lookout for more from this developer.","November 16, 2014","true","0.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It has a interesting short story which can be interpreted in different ways. So if you want to buy it, then you should do it for the story and you should love to read texts, since this game is basically a interactive book combined with a walking simulator and a few hidden keys and button puzzles.\n\nBeside of the story and the atmospheric music everything else is unfortunately pretty bad.\n\n- Graphics: Based on the Unity Engine, 3-4 different Textures and 4-5 different models which are used over and over again. It's okay, but don't expect too much. Especially the underground level are looking bad because of this.\n\n- Sound: It has basically almost no sound at all. It's a rather silent game, except the storm when the night falls.\n\n- Gameplay: You should not mind to walk a LOT. Everything else is reading texts and finding locations on the island.\n\n\nIt still gets a thumb down in the end, because my personal opinion is, that a game today should have a little bit more to offer than just a halfway good story.","December 5, 2015","false","2.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

What we have here is not a game, it's an existential short story with a solid streak of atmospheric horror brought to life. There is no combat, and the gameplay consists solely of walking and exploring while piecing together bits of narrative to gain an understanding of what happened to the island's inhabitants. I finished it the first time in around 25 minutes (missing a bit of the story, yet knowing enough to get the gist of it) and all I want now is to find out if the full story exists somewhere online, so I can read through it again.\n\nWith regards to the horror part of the experience, it does an excellent job of creating tension and unease. At one point in the tunnels, my light started to go as I heard some creature growl in the distance and I started to panic a little.\n\nIn terms of what I didn't like, the non linear storytelling approach that drew me in has also frustrated me a bit as I've missed out on some things and don't quite know how it all fits together. The regular price is a bit much, don't bother unless it's on sale for around a dollar or less.\n\nIn summary, it's a thoughtful journey that leaves me uneasy and wanting more.

It's the same people that think they are so smart and hip for liking a game like gone home where you walk around an empty house for a couple hours, and it counts as a "beautiful immersive story". I call that boring. It reminds me of the south park episode making fun of the "great expectations" novel, that discusses how people can make up and draw all these symbolisms from something that isn't stated. They do that because it makes them feel intelligent when in reality they are just making things up that the author may or may not have intended. This game you spend the entire 40 minutes it takes to finish, wandering by yourself around a small empty island reading books and looking at objects that make you read. There is no backstory or understand of the setting or what is going on. The story is actually interesting in how you see it escalate and you thinking you have it figured out, only for there to be a twist. The problem is you interact with things to tell the story, meaning you might read something from later on before you read other things, making the flow of the story terrible. Also, the ending doesn't explain anything, and some may call "existential" but reality is just left unfinished. Also some of the other parts of the story are unexplained, unfinished, or just don't make sense. There are a few creepy parts but thats about it.

I acknowledge that the developer spent many hours creating it, and I do not want to bash his work; this seemed like a great concept. However, it's not for me. I could not get into it. As I walked through a tunnel, I couldn't help but notice that the textures repeated for the floor, walls, and ceiling. I was irked by the fact that the same "stains" on the texture were visible not seconds apart. As I left the maze of tunnels in search of something to do, I tried to enter a door. It merely told me to come back at night, so I waited. And waited. It took me a few minutes to realize that the time only changes after emerging from another area. Even when I was told it was nighttime, the door did not open. I ended up climbing a mountain, then jumping off the side. I got stuck between an invisible wall and a slope that couldn't be scaled.\n\nI also could not understand the fact that the flashlight had to be charged in an outlet, nor why the houses did not have electricity (yet there was an electrical outlet on top of a mountain).\n\nThis is a simple Unity game intended to take about an hour. There is no save system. The textures repeat in an obvious manner. The music goes audibly silent (no white noise; sounds as if there's a *pop* between loops) before restarting. I tried to understand the developer's way of thinking, but it was very difficult.

The main difference with MOON SILVER is that you can immediately tell it had a much, much smaller budget. It's as if one person who's actually just a writer set out to learn their way aorund the Unity engine just enough to turn one of their stories into an interactive place. Whether or not you decide to bring that against this game (it is only $3 after all) depends on how much of a tolerance you have for extremely low-budget visuals.\n\nMOON SILVER almost looks like it could have been a PS1 game to be honest. The gemoetric shapes are extremely simple and are all covered with messy brown textures. There's also no voiced dialogue -- it's all text, but I actually never bring that against a low-budget game. The game however does just enough to convey the proper atmosphere at several points: the homey feel of a candle-lit house, the isolated loneliness of the main outdoor area, and the haunting final area. Most of it's just simple use of lighting and sound but it works.\n\nThose areas are part of a seemingly deserted island where you read about the lives of the handful of people remaining. I won't spoil the rest, but I'll say the story being the most important part of a game like this, I was pretty impressed with it by the end. If nothig else it's an interesting thing to read through just once.\n\nYeah, MOON SILVER could definitely have used an actual budget and development team. Maybe if it sees any success at all it could get a remake like DEAR ESTHER did. In any case, its current version I think does the bare minimum to accomplish its goal.","December 5, 2014","true","0.9"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

The game is very simple exploration type game where you walk around and look at stuff but the very eerie soundtrack and the bleak atmosphere give this very unsetteling tone.

But there are some negatives. The flashlight shouldnt run out of the battery so quickly and the flickering can get annoying but this is just a minor gripe. The game is also quite short only an hour or shorter depending how fast you go. I beat this game twice and i wasnt dissapointed.

All of these just factor into the true problem.\n\nThe story.\n\nThe whole problem with said story is... well... the story.\n\nThis game is a narrative piece. It is meant more to be a differing means of storytelling from the norm of other video games, as the game itself is merely a vessel for the plot.\n\nI have a softspot for these "Walking Simulators". I absolutely love getting engrossed in them, and watching things unfold as I curl up in my office chair.\n\nHowever, this game had me on the edge of my seat for the first twenty minutes. It was then that I started realizing (or at least guessing) where this was all going: nowhere.\n\nThe story places you in the hands of an unknown character (which is described later in the plot), that is cast upon a "deserted" island. You, the protagonist, have to pick up the pieces (literally and figuratively) as to what happened on the island, and why you are the only one left. There is a mix of puzzle solving, but most all of it is uncovered through the story, finding papers or simply looking at objects to initiate a text conversation. The writing is pretty good, and does well to set the scene.\n\nHowever, as you delve deeper, you lose interest. With the map being so small, the answers are so obvious that it takes no effort nor time at all to complete it. You find yourself simply running around, listening to some ♥♥♥♥wits argue about who took some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Moon doodad.\n\nAnd therein lies the problem. The dev(s?) expect you to be engrossed, they expect you to pace yourself and want to discover, to put the pieces of the literary puzzle into something your own. It is up to you to create this story for yourself.\n\nWhen you do not, you find yourself looking at a bland, vapid sort of empty plot. And, once you put the text together and find yourself in the final chamber, you already know the answer.\n\nOh no, they got me! They weren't actually the bad guys!\n\nI'm not trying to say that I'm smarter than the other people that played this, cause it seems like I'm implying that as I write this. I'm truly not.\n\nThis is a game that expects you to want to figure out the plot, without giving any need to in the first place. Since there was no want for me to finish, as I was not immersed in the somewhat basic, cliche plot, it fell flat for me.","December 1, 2014","false","0.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I'm a very big fan of walking simulators as a genre, but I was initially put off from this game by the 90's-era graphics and apparent horror elements. I was pleasantly surprised to find the game focuses more on a slightly creepy, unsettling atmosphere, rather than any jump scares or monsters. It's a bit like The Vanishing of Ethan Carter or the opening parts of Gone Home in that respect. The story is pretty interesting and I enjoyed the writing.\n\nIf you're looking for jumpscare-laden Youtube reaction-cam fodder, you should look elsewhere.

It can be finished in less than an hour if you ignore the exploration and narrative parts of the game. Try to immerse yourself and understand the story that is being told. You'd be surprised at some of the implications made throughout your playtime, and its ending. Also, don't forget to make your surrounding atmosphere fit the one in the game.

Now I do not have any particular stance on suicide from a moral POV.  From a neo-evolutionary/emotional selection pressure POV I do, but that is beyond the scope of this review.  So I guess I will end it with suicide.  When the POV of your life is reduced to something equivalent to this bleek islandscape with acidic water and skeleton trees + you have a belief that there was a super natural being who was supposed to protect you - it looks like this super natural being has abandoned you = suicide.  Due to the nature of how intellectual pursuits reveal knowledge in this never-ending unfolding of layers like a constant interative adventure, I find it difficult to believe that an individual caught up in learning could ever consider suicide for the sole fact that there is still so much left to know.  But the same author of this game explored in a prior game called fingerbones that very subject - how a father who, due to being "enlightened" from intellectual pursuit, thought the only way for himself to become free was to experience an end of the world type of apacalytic event.  It is clear that there is much to be understood about the collective human mind once it has experienced the beauty of knowledge - how on one side a world of curious scientists are born who strive for the improvement of mankind and the other a world of curious scientists come forth who only wish for mankind's demise.","August 4, 2015","true","0.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The Moon Sliver is more of a walking simulator + visual novel type of game. Steer away if you're expecting replayability and action.\n\nIt has a very nice story behind it, but I was all over the place, so the text was a little jumbled and confusing. Nevertheless, it succeeded in giving me goosebumps throughout the later parts of the game. The problem I had with this game was that I didn't know one of the keys I had was the key to the Chapel, so I basically went underground first, and then subsequently into the chapel. Should I had gone into the chapel, reading the pieces of papers before going into the storage, I think I would have ♥♥♥♥ my pants while being underground.\n\nOverall, this game scores a 7.5/10 from me.

Don't go in expecting graphics that will blow your mind or inventive gameplay, that's not what this is. This is a slow-burn, psychological exploration game made by one person what can be finished in under an hour. The story unfolds through snippets of text that fade in and out as you explore a strange, solitary island. It's up to the player to piece together what has happened to the residents of the island. Without giving any more away, I will say that I got chills at the end of the game, and it stayed on my mind for the rest of the night.

And I'm pretty sorry about it. I understand the intent author's intentions.\nBut it falls short on so many levels ...\n\nThe gameplay: Don't expect anything. It's just a "go fetch this item" game. Moreover necessary items appear on the island for no other reason that "neh eh you're not supposed to gather this key so soon, go back here when you'll need it and it will magically appears " [update] the developper disagree on this one, please look at the comment section. He says, that the items has been here since the beginning .... I might be wrong on this, but even if I'm wrong, it's not enough to put this game on my recommandable list [/update]. Even worse at some point in the game  you have to GUESS a code, it's not written in a book, not told in the dialogs. You simply have to randomly guess it. Even for an optional area, It's kinda hard to swallow. BTW, nothing indicated this area was option\n\nThe story: ... It didn't hook me, I couldn't relate to characters I've never saw, know barely nothing about. How can I deeply bound to charcater in less than a hour? Saying the ending didn't touched me would be a lie. But come on... It's pretty obvious from the beginning what's going to happen. Otherwise, the writing is "ok" I guess, just don't expect high litterature or amazing narration (btw there is no audio dubbing).\n\nThe graphics: It's the minimum, but come on it's been made by only one guy (even if he took textures and objects from here and there). So I won't criticize it. But my eyes still bleed from the flashing effect when you're running low on battery (especially in the tunnel section).\n\nThe audio: Once again, it's a one man project, so .... generic foley effects, and maybe one or two soundtrack I can't remember pretty well (which is not a really good sign). So yeah it's forgettable, but at least it sticks to the mood of the game. It's lonely and grim.\n\nGame's length: ~1 hour\n\nNow you're warned, don't expect any horror in this game, don't expect a revolution narrative gameplay like dear esther. It's mediocre.","January 21, 2015","false","0.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","5"

They sound like something from the late 90s and given the HUGE amount of free sound resources out there with huge databases of decent SFX and free music I have no idea why the laziest/easiest/dullest ideas and samples were used.\n\nI feel the same way about the story. You will know this tale, retold a hundred times and always decent to listen to, but the way the game delivers the narrative in text boxes which sometimes obscure the entire screen in smaller enviroments, well, it's dull. The narrative of the characters may have been interesting yet nothing in the writing made me care or relate or empathize.\n\nI did complete the game having done ALL of the side missions and it wasn't worth my 45 minutes of effort.\n\nI will add that the story has 2 puzzles in total, one of which is an infuriating 'you must guess the code to get through' 4 block/24 possible combination puzzle. You may be thinking to yourself I must be less than an intellectual if it frustrated me to put in up to 24 combinations, but you have to LEAVE THE ROOM TO RESET THE BLOCKS. Doing that 24 times is needlessly irritating and put a stop to any flow the story had.\n\nThe puzzle was lazy as...completing said puzzle didn't add anything of importance to the plot.\n\nThe entire game feels like an incomplete unfinished idea for an atmospheric horror game.

Simple enough to be understood and seen properly.\nThe scenarios will definitely set the tone. Barren lands and post-apocalyptic elements give you the feeling of desolation, desperation, and loneliness. Just what the mood of the game is all about.\n\nThe Audio and the music sounds a little bit off for me. Yes, it sets the tone and the ambiance of the story but it's a source of distraction.\nThey also have scenes with dead air which is not totally needed. I'm actually expecting something big to happen during the dead air. Unfortunately, you just have to read again.\nOverall, I think the music needs a rework.\n\nThe flashlight mechanic is somewhat annoying. You must head to an outlet everytime you ran out of batteries.\nThe element is not really needed since it's just a waste of time and doesn't even connect to the story.\n\nIf you're asking, "Is it worth the $2.99?"\nI say NO.\nIt's better to read an online novel rather than to purchase this game;\nor support your local authors by buying their tangible books.\nTo be honest, I got this game for FREE on Holiday 2014 Christmas Auction and it didn't cost me anything at all, just a thousand Steam gems to grab a copy of the game.\n\nI got overwhelmed when I got this game. This game was already in my wishlist on September 2014. My expectations were so high. But none met my expectations, so I ended up getting disappointed badly.\n\nRating: 2/10\n\nDisclaimer: Everything is purely based on my opinion.\nThanks for reading!~","April 20, 2015","false","513.5"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","25","1","4","2","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/veraliana/recommended/329830/","veraliana","Kelocena","http://steamcommunity.com/id/veraliana/","117 products in account","Overall rating: 9/10\n\nThis game is just plain excellent. It tells a story in scattered pieces about the four inhabitants of an island. As you explore and the more you learn, you begin to put it together. The little boxes of narrative lay the foundation, but little in this story is concretely explained for you. You will need to interpret the narrative pieces to understand the story. The music makes fluid and heart-pounding transitions as different facts unfold. I will admit, the more I played the more horrifying it was. The more you uncover, the more intense the atmosphere becomes. The way the ending came together was perfect. I cannot say more without spoilers, I'm afraid.\n\nThe game is not without its flaws. The text boxes were often on the top of the screen, which is a really awkward place, and they are not cinematic in any way, so you are required to stop walking to read which somewhat weakens the atmosphere (not game breaking in my opinion). Also, while for most of the details of the story, it doesn't matter what order you discover it, there is an area where it is arguably necessary to save for "last" (2nd to last, technically) otherwise it would be very confusing and would not have quite the same impact.\n\nThis game has received several unfair criticisms because players were incapable of comprehending/piecing together the narrative or did not do their research and did not get what they expected. Some have complained the graphics and textures are dated. I feel this is mostly snobbery because I played the game fullscreen on my 23" 1080p moniter, and thought it looked fine (especially considering the game was made by one person). Sorry, but not every game has the budget or is going to look like The Witcher 2 or Final Fantasy. I've seen complaints of "the island was a barren wasteland and there was not enough stuff to interact with." Well, if you play the game and understand the story, it's very easy to see *that's the point!* The game is minimalist, and that is how it's *supposed* to be.\n\nPros:\n+ Atmosphere\n+ Music\n+ Exploration-based narrative ties well together at the end\n+ Sense of foreboding/dread rises incrementally as you proceed\n\nCons:\n- Awkward text box execution\n- *Must* explore all available above ground areas before the underground for the "best" experience","January 14, 2015","true","1.1"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

If you make a story-game make sure you get the player fully involved.\nThe Moon Sliver tries to add exploration and interactivity-elements to it, however it still felt tacked on in favor of telling the story. Let's be honest using a flashlight is just a way in helping to find more places, more storybits.\n\nThe low quality textures/polygones are quite ok for the horror genre.

But mostly, because I genuinely wanted to know who they were and what became of them.\n\nAs I explored, connecting the dots, I began to make sense of things.  I retraced my steps, this time in a more deliberate order.  By the time all pieces of the puzzle laid before me, it was night.\n\nI entered the mountain.","January 14, 2015","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's definitely short (average playthrough is about an hour or so) and a few of its design choices are a little lacking (the text can be a little hard to read at some points and too obstructive at others).\n\nHowever! It does a fantastic job of creating a really, really great atmosphere of tension and foreboding. The plot is also interesting, and tells you a great deal in a short amount of time while leaving you wanting more, making guesses to fill in the blanks. The absolute key to psychological horror is only giving you glimpses of what you should fear, and leaving you to fill in the rest. The Moon Sliver does this very, very well, and creates a wonderfully claustrophobic, lonely atmosphere where you always worry you're never truly alone.\n\nIt's an interesting story that's very entertaining to explore, and gets really tense as it goes on. It is short, and could be improved in a few technical aspects, but, overall, it is definitely worth the price. Set aside an hour or so and give this a run-through. You might very well love it, and it's hardly expensive enough to be much of a risk.\n\n\nOh, and, as a side-note: Contrary to the implication it gives at one point early on, the game is not timing you or anything. Feel free to take your time and explore, when you're reasonably safe. The time progresses as the story does, not in real-time.\n\n...I really hate real-timed games so I felt the need to mention that.","December 19, 2014","true","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Developed by a single person using mostly open-source assets, The Moon Sliver is about as bare bones as one can get using the Unity 3D engine. Featuring the simplest of mechanics and interface, the game has you explore a desolate island housing several scattered structures and piecing together a narrative by clicking on various objects. The presentation (with its screen-wide blocks of text) is poor to say the least, although it still manages to get its story across in a somewhat compelling manner and unlike similar titles like Dear Esther, is easily comprehensible.\n\nThe Moon Sliver is more sketch than game, a first iteration on something that could easily be refined. As I played the game, my designer brain was firing on all cylinders, correcting what I saw as mistakes in direction and presentation, while envisioning a somewhat expanded, more interactive experience. Ultimately this is to the game’s credit. Were there nothing salvageable I likely wouldn’t have thought twice about it. In the end, The Moon Sliver is the work of an author venturing into an interactive medium alone and unsupported. As a first step, it’s a stable one and speaks of future potential. Cheap as it is, The Moon Sliver is a decent expense for those who are interested in exploring interactive narrative, though be aware that what you’re getting is perhaps rougher than most other experiences. Still, it bears a richness that shows promise.","December 23, 2014","true","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While doing this, you are subjected to scattered lines of poorly formatted text popping up on your screen, giving you bits of a story that, frankly, isn't all that engaging.\n\nThe mood of the game, with its music and visual starkness is nice, but it still feels like this game could have been so much more. Also. With so few items you can interact with, why place hammers, wrenches, saws and knives in front of the player that cannot be interacted with? These items would better have been left out. Anything that doesn't contribute to the story only detracts from it and should be removed.\n\nIn fact, the few gaming elements there are just get in the way, and I feel this would have been better if the only gaming element was walking around, entering and leaving doors. Either that, or make it a proper puzzle game, which would also make the story more engaging as any text would give clues to what needed to be done to solve the puzzle. Also, a bit of margins and a better font would have done the reading experience a bit of good too.\n\nI was admittedly also a bit disappointed to find myself finished after only half an hour when I was promised about an hour of gameplay at the beginning, despite covering several locations twice while I waited for night to fall.\n\nIn the end, many aspects of the story and game, save for the music and general atmosphere, feel very unfinished and unpolished, and I don't think I'd recommend it, not even at the discounted £0.99 I paid for it.","March 20, 2015","false","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Wandering the empty, abandoned buildings of the island, gleaning little bits of the story, piece by piece assembling some picture of the people who had lived and died there, and then finally turning up the key to the chapel and the question of the fate of the object the game is titled after.\n\nAnd that's as far as I got.\n\nEmerging from the chapel, it was dark and raining vigorously. "The night was wild and dark", a narration text box informed me, on the off chance I hadn't noticed. Aha! An instruction from the start of the game had been to go to the mountain when night fell.

There had been a locked hatch and a locked box, neither of which could be opened. A check of them revealed that they were, in fact, both still locked. Maybe there were more keys? A diligent and repeated search of every structure revealed no keys, nor any viable key substitutes such as crowbars or shaped charges. Maybe it just took time? There had been some kind of text about setting aside an hour to play. A ten minute break was taken to make tea and reconsider the problem, followed by another vigorous search of the buildings.\n\nIt was then that I was forced to confront the essential futility of all action. Staggering around through the rainy night pawing at the possessions of the deceased in a useless attempt to obey the voice in my head that told me to do something that was apparently physically impossible.\n\nOr maybe I'd missed another dark brown or grey key somewhere among the other dark brown or grey objects in a world of various shades of brown and grey, many of which were dark. By this point I'd forgotten about the framing narrative, however, escaping its brief capture of my interest.\n\nThis is why you should never listen to voices in your head telling you to go to the mountains at night. In no way is attempting to obey them a better use of your time than wandering off to make a cup of tea.","February 9, 2015","false","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

The narrative however is simply lacking, I know it's meant to be one of these free roam walking simulators where you discover the story but the walls of text really detracted from any form of immersion. Sometimes the text would overlap if you get too close to another object that sets off a prompt and it would just clutter the screen. I honestly didn't care for the characters and the walls of text kind of ruined what would've been a decent ending.

Developed by a single person using mostly open-source assets, The Moon Sliver is about as bare bones as one can get using the Unity 3D engine. Featuring the simplest of mechanics and interface, the game has you explore a desolate island housing several scattered structures and piecing together a narrative by clicking on various objects. The presentation (with its screen-wide blocks of text) is poor to say the least, although it still manages to get its story across in a somewhat compelling manner and unlike similar titles like Dear Esther, is easily comprehensible.\n\nThe Moon Sliver is more sketch than game, a first iteration on something that could easily be refined. As I played the game, my designer brain was firing on all cylinders, correcting what I saw as mistakes in direction and presentation, while envisioning a somewhat expanded, more interactive experience. Ultimately this is to the game’s credit. Were there nothing salvageable I likely wouldn’t have thought twice about it. In the end, The Moon Sliver is the work of an author venturing into an interactive medium alone and unsupported. As a first step, it’s a stable one and speaks of future potential. Cheap as it is, The Moon Sliver is a decent expense for those who are interested in exploring interactive narrative, though be aware that what you’re getting is perhaps rougher than most other experiences. Still, it bears a richness that shows promise.","December 23, 2014","true","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I got it in a bundle and figured I would give it a try. It is short, literally took me an hour to leasurely and fullyexplore and find all the pices of the story and put it together. This game has a lot of mystery and while you gain answers more questions arise which kept me going wanting to exlore further. The graphics aren't triple A top of the line, but that clearly wasn't the point. While I do love playing triple A titles with maxed setting, this game really doesn't need it. The area is small, and isn't packed with game assests for the player to get lost in exploring pointless scenery. The more of the story you uncover the more it all fits. By the end, if you have uncovered all the narrations, you will have a pretty good picture of the scenario. I am still left with questions of the back story of this story, but this is just a short story and I enjoyed every moment of it.\n\nTo all the people that rated it down, I am seriously at a loss for words at how sad it is that people were unable to comprehend the game. Such a simple concept and story went over their heads, or there wasn't enough visual eye candy effects to keep your narrow minded perspective or attention involved. There are complaints that it is too small and minimalistic, yet people are confused by the limited text that tells the story. I get it is jumbled, but have you never done a puzzle? Never had to connect the dots or organize information? I don't mean to be rude or anything, I am not some better than, but seriously WOW. I am embarrassed for you. That's fine if it isn't your type of game, there are many games that I am sure are great for their genre that I just am not into, but it what was said about the game that gets me.

(and maybe even play videogames if he's not busy :D)\n\nSo now, ten months later I suddenly started thinking about writing reviews on his games.\nI felt like that would be the least I could do as I highly respect him and like to help him out as much as I can.\nSo now that this intoduction is over, I'll stop writing my letter to David and start actually talking about the game. :D\n\nThe Moon Sliver takes place on a dying island.\nFour people live there.\nThey have to trust eachother, help eachother and listen to eachother to make sure that they'll keep their minds off the horrible, depressing and sad thoughts that they keep in the darkest corners of their minds.\nSmiles can be wonderful masks you know...\n\n...Oh yeah, that's all I'll say about the story, I've already spoiled more than I should about this fantastic little game.\n\nBut, I guess I COULD tell you a little bit more about the game.\n\nFirst off, this game is NOT for people who do not enjoy reading in videogames.\nSecond off, this game is NOT for people who enjoy having their poo poo come out of their butt when Freddy Fazeclanbear or whatever he's called shows up on your screen, screaming his throat out. This game has NO jumpscares! (and it feels so ♥♥♥♥ing good to say that ooohh yeaaa)\nThird off(?), did I mention that this game has no jumpscares?\n\n"But what tha heck do ya do this this computer gaime??" Well, I'll sure tell you, you...Cool person that says computer game instead of videogame!\n\nYou walk around a dying island, unveiling and piecing together the fragments that explain what happened to the island, the people who lived there and even how the island came to be. (That's the WRONG game, ooooooooo)\n\nYeah, that's actually what you do in the game, but I love it and if you don't like the sound of that then why don't I get this totally real quote from David Szymanski himself to tell you how cool it is. "Hey, I'm the real David Szymanski and Derp's totally right, my game is the coolest, even my dog plays it. Also, Derp is really cool and has big muscles and all the women like him and are all over that man for real. Also this quote is real." See? Told you it's a cool game.\n...\nSuch a nice man.\n\nUhm, anyways, what else is there...Hmm...MUSIC! Yes, music!\nThe music isn't too big of a deal honestly, but it truly does bring out a great atmosphere so it does it's job.\nDavid made it and you can actually buy the soundtrack here on steam which I did so throw a few smackarooines at him if you feel like listening to that music.\n\nVISUALS!! The visuals in The Moon Sliver has been a little issue with some of the players of The Moon Sliver.\nNow, let me just say...What the ♥♥♥♥? The visuals of The Moon Sliver was my favorite part of the game, it's what sparked my interest among a few other things when I watched the trailer for it. (originally I thought that the game took place in a prison in a desert but apparently not XP)\nBasically, I find the negative judging of the visuals of The Moon Sliver highly offensive towards my artist side.\nTo anyone who liked them, you know what's up. B)\n\nAnd that's all I'd like to say about The Moon Sliver.

Not just because it's hard to maintain tension for long periods, but also because constant breaks in gameplay can disrupt the experience.\nMoon Sliver is a prime example of this being pulled off exceptionally. It manages to insert the sadness of a character drama and the dread of a horror title into a condensed, one hour package. Setting and characters are established quickly and with a writing prowess which somehow pulls off being both descriptive and deep, yet minimalistic and straightforward. The writing is the star of the show, which is great since many horror games stumble over this portion. Furthermore, make no mistake that despite the game's length, it is undeniably scary and claustrophobic. In fact, it is likely because the game ended on such an abrupt - and sad - note that it will stay with me for quite some time.\n5/5 stars.\nI would have easily paid double for this game.

As a game selling for $3, I can't recommend The Moon Sliver. It's not that it's bad, it's not even that it's short, it's that I can never personally see myself ever playing it again. Unless there's alternate endings (which I'm fairly certain there aren't), there's not really any reason to play it again. It does tell a surprisingly good story with interesting enough themes and the like, but it's not anything Earth-shattering. And that's okay. It tells a personal story about 4 people in a horrible situation. It leaves a lot of things open to interpretation, while still giving closure. Since it's currently on sale for about 60 cents, I recommend checking it out. It's worth your time if you like atmospheric first-person exploration- even if it is on the extremely small and short side.\n\ntl;dr? This game is like making love with a little person that's only after you for your money so they can save their sick family member; It's short and somewhat shallow in certain areas, but its heart is in the right place.\n\n7/10","July 2, 2015","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","3"

That being said it tells a good story  in a way that only a video game can. It manages to immerse you in the story with almost no background whatsoever and has you constantly wondering what is actually happening.

You can only walk around and use your flashlight, which is not a very large gameplay element, since I only once had to worry about running out of battery. The story has text-based dialogue and no narration.\nStoryThe story reminds me of a novel as it does not directly display how you got into the place you're in and why the world is like it is. The story is also from a very strange perspective. As it has an alternating third-person narrator, and does not let you know who you are, and what do you have to do with the story. The story ends in a very sudden and neutral way, but it has a very deep atmosphere and leaves you very satisfied.\nSummaryThis game has a great story and atmosphere. It's a shame this game could not have been created with created better graphics and narration. I think this game was well worth the low price, even though it is very short and technically unimpressive. It's like a novel transformed into a game. It has a deep atmosphere and it leaves you with a strange and special composite of different feelings.

There's little in the way of gameplay, just movement and limited contextual interaction, yet it manages to engross by atmosphere alone. In fact, rarely has the term "atmospheric" applied to a game more strongly.\n\nYou explore a limited but engrossing environment and absorb backstory as you go. This backstory is presented only in the order in which you encounter it, yet is sufficiently cohesive that no one piece seems out of place, and this is partly because the backstory is so deliberately thin, or perhaps more accurately, so light of touch. It is used once again for the purpose of enhancing atmosphere, and this it does. Now, the actual "moon sliver" part is weaker, because at no point is it made entirely clear just what that even is, nor what the origins of its associated mythology may have been. Then again, this leaves it open to interpretation and imagination, which further serves to deepen the sense of mystery and general lack of groundedness that this game is so successful in engendering in the player. The overall effect of the game's combined elements is really quite striking, and feed well into its ending.\n\nThe only points to remember are these: 1) If you can't get into an area yet, then you just haven't found and read all of the available backstory material, and 2) take advantage of the power outlets to recharge your flashlight [it only takes one zap].

I got it in a bundle and figured I would give it a try. It is short, literally took me an hour to leasurely and fullyexplore and find all the pices of the story and put it together. This game has a lot of mystery and while you gain answers more questions arise which kept me going wanting to exlore further. The graphics aren't triple A top of the line, but that clearly wasn't the point. While I do love playing triple A titles with maxed setting, this game really doesn't need it. The area is small, and isn't packed with game assests for the player to get lost in exploring pointless scenery. The more of the story you uncover the more it all fits. By the end, if you have uncovered all the narrations, you will have a pretty good picture of the scenario. I am still left with questions of the back story of this story, but this is just a short story and I enjoyed every moment of it.\n\nTo all the people that rated it down, I am seriously at a loss for words at how sad it is that people were unable to comprehend the game. Such a simple concept and story went over their heads, or there wasn't enough visual eye candy effects to keep your narrow minded perspective or attention involved. There are complaints that it is too small and minimalistic, yet people are confused by the limited text that tells the story. I get it is jumbled, but have you never done a puzzle? Never had to connect the dots or organize information? I don't mean to be rude or anything, I am not some better than, but seriously WOW. I am embarrassed for you.

I pondered a lot of time sitting and thinking wether I wanted to buy this game. I did it. However, instead of getting a simply indie game, I recieved a beautiful interactive fairy tale, a dark one, but a fairy tale at last. The moon sliver is an experience, not entirely a game, which you have to go through. Even though is short and basically a walking simulator, it is worth giving it a look, mainly because of its solid story and its amazing atmosphere. The graphics could be better but you completely overlook that while you're playing because of how invested you're in the story. What this game does great is that it makes you hunt for little pieces of the story, turning it into a kind of a "story-driven-puzzle". It's not offered to you served in silver platter. That's why I could see people getting confused with the story, shouldn't they pay enough attention. As regard to the characters, I give props to the developer for doing everything with writing, and no voice acting, given that it accentures the tone of the game. Nevertheless, I feel that all that reading could put off some players. Of course it has its faults (like the flashlight system that is a little bit clunky or the maze thing that I believed unnecesary) but overall it is a beautiful game that I could see myself playing again. Definitely give this one a chance.","December 26, 2015","true","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"

You're left to explore a desolate island and piece together the story by interacting with objects in the environment. Is interacting really the right word? No, not really, when you click on specific objects or enter specific rooms you are presented with a piece of text. This is mainly how the story is presented, through one to two paragraph sections of text. This games avoids becoming boring due to its non-existant gameplay and small environment by being short. It takes about 45 minutes to complete the game. Graphics wise, it's not very impressive. The visual style is fitting, but not particularly impressive. The music effectivley sets the tone and contributes greatly to developing the lonely and unsettling tone of the game, particulary in the last 5ish minutes.

(and maybe even play videogames if he's not busy :D)\n\nSo now, ten months later I suddenly started thinking about writing reviews on his games.\nI felt like that would be the least I could do as I highly respect him and like to help him out as much as I can.\nSo now that this intoduction is over, I'll stop writing my letter to David and start actually talking about the game. :D\n\nThe Moon Sliver takes place on a dying island.\nFour people live there.\nThey have to trust eachother, help eachother and listen to eachother to make sure that they'll keep their minds off the horrible, depressing and sad thoughts that they keep in the darkest corners of their minds.\nSmiles can be wonderful masks you know...\n\n...Oh yeah, that's all I'll say about the story, I've already spoiled more than I should about this fantastic little game.\n\nBut, I guess I COULD tell you a little bit more about the game.\n\nFirst off, this game is NOT for people who do not enjoy reading in videogames.\nSecond off, this game is NOT for people who enjoy having their poo poo come out of their butt when Freddy Fazeclanbear or whatever he's called shows up on your screen, screaming his throat out. This game has NO jumpscares! (and it feels so ♥♥♥♥ing good to say that ooohh yeaaa)\nThird off(?), did I mention that this game has no jumpscares?\n\n"But what tha heck do ya do this this computer gaime??" Well, I'll sure tell you, you...Cool person that says computer game instead of videogame!\n\nYou walk around a dying island, unveiling and piecing together the fragments that explain what happened to the island, the people who lived there and even how the island came to be. (That's the WRONG game, ooooooooo)\n\nYeah, that's actually what you do in the game, but I love it and if you don't like the sound of that then why don't I get this totally real quote from David Szymanski himself to tell you how cool it is. "Hey, I'm the real David Szymanski and Derp's totally right, my game is the coolest, even my dog plays it. Also, Derp is really cool and has big muscles and all the women like him and are all over that man for real. Also this quote is real." See? Told you it's a cool game.\n...\nSuch a nice man.\n\nUhm, anyways, what else is there...Hmm...MUSIC! Yes, music!\nThe music isn't too big of a deal honestly, but it truly does bring out a great atmosphere so it does it's job.\nDavid made it and you can actually buy the soundtrack here on steam which I did so throw a few smackarooines at him if you feel like listening to that music.\n\nVISUALS!! The visuals in The Moon Sliver has been a little issue with some of the players of The Moon Sliver.\nNow, let me just say...What the ♥♥♥♥? The visuals of The Moon Sliver was my favorite part of the game, it's what sparked my interest among a few other things when I watched the trailer for it. (originally I thought that the game took place in a prison in a desert but apparently not XP)\nBasically, I find the negative judging of the visuals of The Moon Sliver highly offensive towards my artist side.\nTo anyone who liked them, you know what's up. B)\n\nAnd that's all I'd like to say about The Moon Sliver. A great little game with barely any flaws that I can think of.\nSo, now I'd like to say thank you David Szymanski for responding to my long message that one time in march, now I'm off to do whatever.

The pacing is excellent (at least, it was in the way I played it. The player DOES have freedom to explore the island in how they see fit). I did get kinda stuck near the end for a bit because what I thought was "night time", was not "night time", so I thought the game was bugged. And what I missed was kind of in plain sight actually.\n\nBut once I found it, and night finally came (and man, did it really come), I found myself moving towards a very nicely done ending that left me speechless and wide-eyed through the credits.\n\n","August 11, 2015","true","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Well it's not much of a game, rather it's more of an interactive story. Actually, you don't really interact with the story, you just move around reading little snippets that slowly unveil the story. It's almost like the audio diaries from Bioshock, but this is pretty much an entire game based around that concept. It doesn't have very good graphics, but the story is really good. And that's pretty important that the story is good, because story is all this game has. The game is very short, but has a very low price, so you wouldn't waste much time or money by trying it out. Overall, I'd highly suggest this game. If I wanted to, I could return this game, since I finished it in less than an hour. However, I am not going to.

I got it in a bundle and figured I would give it a try. It is short, literally took me an hour to leasurely and fullyexplore and find all the pices of the story and put it together. This game has a lot of mystery and while you gain answers more questions arise which kept me going wanting to exlore further. The graphics aren't triple A top of the line, but that clearly wasn't the point. While I do love playing triple A titles with maxed setting, this game really doesn't need it. The area is small, and isn't packed with game assests for the player to get lost in exploring pointless scenery. The more of the story you uncover the more it all fits. By the end, if you have uncovered all the narrations, you will have a pretty good picture of the scenario. I am still left with questions of the back story of this story, but this is just a short story and I enjoyed every moment of it.\n\nTo all the people that rated it down, I am seriously at a loss for words at how sad it is that people were unable to comprehend the game. Such a simple concept and story went over their heads, or there wasn't enough visual eye candy effects to keep your narrow minded perspective or attention involved. There are complaints that it is too small and minimalistic, yet people are confused by the limited text that tells the story. I get it is jumbled, but have you never done a puzzle? Never had to connect the dots or organize information? I don't mean to be rude or anything, I am not some better than, but seriously WOW. I am embarrassed for you. That's fine if it isn't your type of game, there are many games that I am sure are great for their genre that I just am not into, but it what was said about the game that gets me.

Gameplay consists of walking around clicking on things and going through areas to find little pieces of text that come together to tell us a story; or at least, part of one. The snippets hint at something quite interesting going on on this island, though of course we get only a glimpse. This is no fault, though. Intrigue is built on what one doesn't know. The vague spiritualism and fantastical elements makes what would normally be a stock whodunit story into something a bit greater.\n\n\nVery short. I beat the game in 38 minutes, though I missed nothing and didn't dawdle. I assume to finish the game one must find all the pieces of the narrative. You're paying three bucks for roughly an hour's worth of entertainment. I can think of worse ways to spend that money, however, I can think also think of longer, better games available for free. I don't mind spending the cash; I hope it encourages the developer to do more. Just remember, there's zero replay value here.","August 22, 2015","true","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As a game selling for $3, I can't recommend The Moon Sliver. It's not that it's bad, it's not even that it's short, it's that I can never personally see myself ever playing it again. Unless there's alternate endings (which I'm fairly certain there aren't), there's not really any reason to play it again. It does tell a surprisingly good story with interesting enough themes and the like, but it's not anything Earth-shattering. And that's okay. It tells a personal story about 4 people in a horrible situation. It leaves a lot of things open to interpretation, while still giving closure. Since it's currently on sale for about 60 cents, I recommend checking it out. It's worth your time if you like atmospheric first-person exploration- even if it is on the extremely small and short side.\n\ntl;dr?
