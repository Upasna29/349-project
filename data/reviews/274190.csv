"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bralef/recommended/274190/","bralef","Colonel Mustache","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bralef/","486 products in account","You can literally punch Satan so hard he explodes.\n\nI could stop the review right there, 'nuff said. Except no, there's so much more to it than that. Broforce is more than just a one-track gag, it's a love letter to 80s and 90s action heroes wrapped in an homage to Contra, Metal Slug, and with a little Worms for good measure.\n\nAt first glance, the game may come off as simply a novelty. But they didn't just take a generic character, slap the name Rambro on him, and call it good. Every single character in the cast of over 30 has a great deal of love and detail worked into them. Each character has a unique primary attack, a special attack, and a melee attack. Rambro has a trusty machine gun and versatile grenades, whereas Bro Heart has a claymore and the ability to scare enemies by screaming at the top of his lungs. If a character is played by Van Damme, you better believe he can deliver split kicks to terrorists' faces.\n\nTherein lies Broforce's "gimmick:" You start each level with a single life and a random Bro you've unlocked so far. Freeing a Bro trapped in a cage will grant you another life, while also swapping your character to another random Bro. Thus, you have to decide between keeping your current character, or getting the extra life. It's a simple mechanic when you get down to it, but it adds a huge amount of replay value to the game - You'll rarely beat a given level the same way twice.\n\nEach character, given that they're completely different, has their own upsides and downsides. Brocketeer may lack the raw firepower of the other characters, but his jetpack lets him rocket punch dudes and make crazy jumps. MacBrover's dynamite may be less straightforward than a gun, but timed right can cause absolute carnage. Of the gigantic cast, there are maybe one or two characters I try to avoid, and even they can get the job done.\n\nPart of Broforce's charm is in its sheer hilarity and the number of things you can do. I once threw a guy at another guy, killing them both...The second guy was a suicide bomber, however, so he exploded, sending a dog flying through a door, which killed another guy as it opened. You can kill a guy by hitting him in the head with a flash grenade. You can kill Satan by throwing another Satan at him (the latter Satan also dies). You can throw your claymore, which decapitates everyone in its path. Someone out of range may try to shoot you, but your claymore, now stuck in the ground, will reflect the bullets right back into his evil face.\n\nThat's not to say Broforce is completely without faults. In all the carnage and chain-reactions of destruction, it is pretty easy to die, especially when most characters die from a single shot. There are definitely some deaths that feel like they were unavoidable, such as an explosive barrel falling on top of me from offscreen. The reason why I completely forgive this, however, is because of how fun the whole thing is. Death usually has little consequence, so an annoying moment here and there are easily remedied by the barrels of laughs in between. It's definitely a game that's more fun than frustrating. As someone who's not particularly hardcore, the game has never been so frustrating that it made me want to stop playing.\n\nMultiplayer makes the game even more fun and more chaotic. Depending on the level, adding more players can make the game easier (because of the multiplied firepower) or harder (because of the added chaos and thin-spread lives), but almost always makes it more fun. You can high five one another (triggering slow motion), flex together, and if you really want you can drop the rescue chopper on their head. Everyone starts the next level with exactly 1 life anyway, so messing around at the end of the level is surprisingly consequence-free.\n\nAlong with the main levels, there are challenge levels, which when completed unlock powerups in the rest of the game. You can call in an "All-American Supply Drop", aka a nearly-invincible mech with the american flag plastered on in place of a windshield, or take some steroiVITAMINS that let you throw dudes like Superman and scare enemies with your homoerotic grunts.\n\nAt the end of the level, after you've shot Satan in the face (or punched him so hard he exploded, or thrown him off a cliff, or beaten him to death with his own minions, or scared him so hard he jumped to his death), you (and your friends, on the rare occasion you coordinate everyone's jumps correctly) board the rescue chopper and fly off into the distance, as a rockin' victory theme plays and the entire level explodes for no discernible reason.\n\nThat's a perfect image to sum up Broforce: Over the top, ridiculous, nonsensical fun. It would have been very easy for the developers to take the game's concept and turn it into a one-track novelty that doesn't actually amount to much. But Free Lives is the prime example of what a game developer should be. They didn't just put time, money, and effort into this game: They put love into it. They clearly weren't just trying to make a quick buck, they made Broforce because they loved the things they based it off and wanted to share that with other people. Broforce is a game that's a great idea in theory and an even better idea in reality. It is, quite simply, one of the greatest games I've ever played.\n\nPlay this ♥♥♥♥ing game.","December 22, 2015","true","214.7"," 631 of 648 people (97%) found this review helpful 208 people found this review funny","97","631","648","208","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/More_Badass/recommended/274190/","More_Badass","More_Badass","http://steamcommunity.com/id/More_Badass/","624 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nBroforce was my first impulse purchase when I got into PC gaming last summer and I don't regret it at all.\n---\nBroforce is not the most sophisticated game. A story is non-existent and there's not much motivation beyond rescue the hostages and kill the bad guys. But that's not much of a negative at all, because the gameplay blows away any wishes for a story or deeper motives. Broforce set out to be an ode to 80's and 90's action movies, the Expendables in video game form, and it succeeds on every possible level.\n\nThe biggest selling point is the characters, all pixel-art parodies of 80's and 90's action movie heroes. Rambo, Commando, Walker Texas Ranger, Snake Plissken, John McClane, The Terminator, Judge Dredd, and more are available to play as and each with their own unique weapon and secondary explosive. You start each level off as a random hero and can switch to another by rescuing hostages, similar to the weapon swapping mechanic in Super Crate Box.\n\nEach level is a fully destructible playground filled with explosive barrels, propane canisters, and many many enemies ranging from simple goons to suicide bombers to guard dogs and mini-gun wielding mini-bosses. The stylized graphics are nicely detailed, with blood, dirt, smoke, and fire flying with every explosion. The destructible environments adds an layer of depth, allowing you to tunnel beneath enemies to flank them or collapse the ground under their feet or crush them beneath trucks and heavy debris. All those tricks and fast reflexes will be needed because the game is not easy. You die in one hit.\n---\nThose impressions are months old, but remain as true as ever. Broforce is hard, it's chaotic, it's challenging, it's fun as hell. You feel like a badass, but you also havve to plan your attack because you can die so fast. A lot of times, rushing in will get you killed, while it would be better to flank from above or blow the ground away from below.\n\nSince I wrote that, new heroes have been added, from Neo to Machete. New bosses and challenging new enemies and mini-bosses to fight. New levels and mechanics. The editor has been improved and expanded. Unlike the majority of betas, this feels like a finished games that gets big content updates rather than a skeleton of a game missing critical features like some Early Access games.\n\nSo the bottom line: Broforce is a mother♥♥♥♥ing blast and you should play it if you like fast arcade action with highly destructive environments and the chance to play as your favorite action heroes.","April 7, 2014","true","21.2"," 689 of 752 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","689","752","0","17"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/amedeus8/recommended/274190/","amedeus8","Comrade St. Nikolai","http://steamcommunity.com/id/amedeus8/","779 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nBROFORCE (you have to say it as a growling shout, or you don't do the game justice) is a game about action heroes. Actual action heroes, as it turns out. Oh, sure, the names change. But with a list of playable characters that includes "Rambro", "MacBrover", and "B.A. Broracus" I think we all know the score.\n\nDon't worry, I'm going to try to steer clear of mentioning any but the earlier-unlocked characters in this review. For the best effect, I recommend not spoiling the list for yourself. One of the most fun parts of Broforce is the anticipation of the next unlock, and witnessing the reveal to the sound of the character's name being shouted by the thoroughly-manly announcer.\n\nBROFORCE is a run-and-gun platformer. The game moves briskly, but not so much so that you can't keep up. It's a nice speed that feels appropriately actiony without feeling unfair. Controls are slick and responsive. Deaths will usually be your own fault, and are accompanied by a noticeable lack of frustration. We all know that feel, right? You die in a game, have to start the level over, and curse either very loudly or under your breath, depending on who's nearby. In Broforce, I don't have that. The game plays so well, the action so entertaining, that having to try again only serves to prolong the enjoyable experience.\n\nThe environments are almost entirely destructable. The effect reminds me of Worms, but with a little more detail to it. When you destroy some dirt, a block or two above it may also crumble. Destroying the ground underneath of a support will cause the support to fall apart piece-by-piece. Blocks in ruins will fall and crush anyone underneath. You can blow up explosive barrels, of course, but you can also send propane canisters rocketing satisfyingly into anything in their path, pushing enemies through walls and then detonating after a short distance. Think the conclusion to the final battle in the film version of Kick-♥♥♥.\n\nThe main draw of the game is the still-growing number of Bros to play as. You don't get to pick your Bro, they're randomly chosen from the ones you've unlocked so far. Unlock more Bros by rescuing more P.O.W. Bros from cages through the game. Each Bro rescued gives you an extra life and turns you into a new Bro. The new Bros are unlocked after you do this certain numbers of times. At the moment, I believe it takes some 300 rescues to catch 'em all.\n\nThe other way to change Bros is to die (and have at least one life remaining). I've seen people complain about not being able to choose who to play as, but I stand by the current model. It's the same sort of thing I really enjoyed about the way Bastion forced you to use each new weapon for a short time. You can't just pick one thing that works and run through the entire game using only that thing. It would get boring before you were even halfway through, and there's not a chance you wouldn't blame the game for that. Having to use each one, whether you like it or not, allows you come to appreciate the pros and cons of each instead of ignoring the new thing to stick with your favorite.\n\nThe Bro lottery simply means that you have to develop your tactics on the fly. Let me tell you, I hated MacBrover at first. Instead of firing bullets at everything, you now have to throw timed explosives at them. And his special is just a remote-detonated version of that. What a rip-off, right? WRONG. SHUT UP. YOU SIT BACK DOWN AND YOU LISTEN, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ YOU. Turns out, MacBrover is pretty much the bane of most bosses. Most Bros can only shoot straight ahead. They may have a special that lets them lob a grenade or whatever. But those specials are limited, and the grenade will honestly probably just bounce a safe distance away from your target, anyways. MacBrover's explosives will detonate more-or-less exactly where you drop them. And since it's his main attack, he can do this infinitely. Find a nice perch and unload, man. Plus, I mean, once you get the hang of it, dropping explosives so that they stick to the general rabble is pretty fun, too.\n\nNow imagine an entire game, FILLED with Bros, all of whom have their pros and cons just like MacBrover. Now imagine that you never know who you'll be playing as next. Getting somebody who meshes well with the situation at hand means plowing through that situation while your heart drips with physical glee. Getting somebody who isn't perfect for the situation means being confronted with a fun challenge where you have to work your way through it like a man.\n\nThere's a good variety to your enemies, as well. You'll kill loads and loads of the basic mooks, but you have big guys, dogs, bomb-tossers, and more. Each of the bosses manages to be pretty unique. I mean, you know, they're mostly just giant death machines that fire big guns at you. But they move differently, fire different types of big guns in different trajectories... look, point is, you won't get bored of the enemy variety, alright?\n\nBROFOOOORCE is still in Early Access, meaning you can expect loads more content in the future. At the moment, one playthrough will probably run you maybe 3-5 hours. The game's enough fun, though, that you shouldn't be surprised if you play it all over again once you're done. Maybe in co-op, this time. The Steam Workshop will extend the length of the game quite a bit. Plus the new Alien campaign (inspired by the Alien series of films) is only just around the corner, and that'll help. New Bros come out now and then, and the devs still have more ideas up their sleeves. You shouldn't be afraid of the "Early Access" label on this one. You'll get your money's worth.\n\nI mentioned co-op. There are actually several multiplayer modes. Co-op is the main one. At the moment, online co-op can be a little laggy at times. It's not perfect. It's not terrible either, though. I've played through the full campaign with a friend, and while there were times where the effects of my friend's actions would play out before they actually performed those actions (often resulting in everything turning into sudden explosions and chaos so that I quickly lost track of what was going on, and usually died as a result), as I said, we did finish the campaign, and the majority of that time consisted of both ♥♥♥♥♥ and giggles.\n\nThere is an issue with the way the online game treats things like the local game, however. Even online, the screens tries to keep everyone in it at once. If it fails, then it will focus on one person, meaning that the other player can't really see what they're doing. 98% of the time, this isn't a problem. But there was one boss that moves vertically that really tripped us up. My strategy is to climb the boss as quickly as possible. My friend's strategy is to not do that. He immediately finds himself offscreen, dead, and waiting for me to ride the boss to death or success.\n\nI'll probably update this review every now and then until the game is out, and then I may or may not rewrite it to reflect the final product. If you don't see anything after this paragraph, then the former hasn't happened, yet. If you're even reading this paragraph, then the latter hasn't happened, yet. Anyways, get some BROFORCE, bro!","January 27, 2015","true","26.0"," 144 of 146 people (99%) found this review helpful 35 people found this review funny","99","144","146","35","2"

Hands down at the top of my list for couch co-op games. It's so good my wife even begs to play on some days (she is absolutely not a gamer and actually hates games).\n\nA typical day off work for us here at our place:\nInvite some bros over\nWe order pizza\nEat munchies\nStart up broforce...and before you know it -birds are chirping, sun is out, and you have to wake up in 3 hours to go to work - and you don't even care, you had a blast - this is THAT Kind of game...\n\nThe gameplay is fantastic. The campaign is a blast. Explosion runs are races that are challenging and fun. Don't even get me started on deathmatch! We all get so competitive, it's crazy. I recommend if you are new to broforce, PLEASE don't spoil the surprise of looking at all the character unlocks. We had fun calling them out and being surprised just by that element alone. Each character has different weapons, grenades and abilities - some extremely more powerful than others, but they are all evenly balanced for deathmatch.\n\nI've even been invited to a really lame party a while back, so I whipped out my laptop from my backpack, hooked up broforce to their flatscreen - ♥♥♥♥ got intense. If you read most of these reviews, they are all trying to be funny, since the theme of the game is democracy, and liberating vietnam, and spreading love for 'murica... however they aren't being very helpful in describing the product. I think i've accurately described one of the best games on the market. This game will make your cheeks hurt from smiling and laughing all night. Expendabros is NOTHING compared to the real deal here... But if you haven't gotten it yet - this is best played with real friends, side by side. I use logitech F310's and they work perfectly. Trust me. Buy this game.","November 24, 2014","true","49.2"," 140 of 144 people (97%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","97","140","144","0","5"

This is the action movie archetype, the reason we sit in cinemas summer after summer—a plotline now so mechanical, that Free Lives went ahead and turned it into a mechanic.\n\nIt’s how every single level of Broforce’s technically endless campaign plays out (a level editor and custom playlists back up the sizeable main game). Like any action movie, the details might alter. Sometimes you’re taking one of those massive, diagonally-moving lifts you only ever see in evil labs rather than grabbing a chopper-lifted ladder, but the effect is the same\n\nIn fact, this is Broforce’s entire design outlook. It pilfers from action movies, and uses their familiarity to build an immediately readable take on the accepted run ‘n’ gun genre—all pixels, enemy screams and one-shot-one-death twitchery.\n\nThe playable "bros" are Broforce's most obvious references. You play as a line-up of real action stars disguised behind increased muscle mass and names with “Bro” clumsily wedged into them. John Rambro, Mr. Anderbro, Broheart. Every one of the game’s tens of characters is pacey, can climb any surface infinitely, and comes with primary, secondary and melee weapons. But they can play totally differently—the brilliance here being that, if you’re au fait with the action film canon, you’ll have a handle on how they’ll work, even before you’ve used them.","October 27, 2015","true","11.3"," 151 of 164 people (92%) found this review helpful 42 people found this review funny","92","151","164","42","3"

The player must fight through the destroyable world and little brown resistance, in order to reach the end, and kill satan himself, before jumping onto a helicopter with explosions behind you.\n\n\n\nWith over 20 playable “Bros” to pick from, all coming from movies or TV in the 80s or 90s, will make any action movie fan wet themselves with nostalgia. Each character has their own special attack and primary weapon, making each one a new experience. “Bros” are unlocked by rescuing a certain number of POW’s; also doubling as lives for the player. Each time a player re-spawns, a new random unlocked character is selected, changing the play style.\n\n\n\nOne major point about the game everyone should be aware of, is the player only has 1 life point. Falling too far, or catching any bullet, will kill you. Thankfully, the enemies have a slow reaction time, and like to shoot very slow bullets; fast enough to kill you, but slow enough to jump out of the way of. The enemy's range from, massive minigun guys, to dogs, to tanks, to typical tanned jungle dwellers. The ingame environment is 90% destroyable, excluding some checkpoints and the end bit.\n\n\n\nBroForce does some things right.\n\n\n\nThe destroyable word adds more fun into the game\n\nThe multiplayer is fantastic\n\nThe characters are fun to play\n\nBroForce doesn't take itself seriously\n\nEach special ability is either useful or funny in some way\n\nMaintains a proper difficulty curve\n\nHas a level editor\n\nVery nostalgic\n\nYou get to kill satan\n\n\n\nBroForce does some things wrong\n\n\nThe levels editor is sometimes buggy\n\nHard to play multiplayer with randoms\n\nRepetitive\n\nStill buggy\n\nSome characters are almost useless\n\nLacks playing cards and achievements\n\n\n\nAll in all BroForce isn't a wonderful game, that being said, it is stupid fun and is damn good. Players can kill many hours blowing things and people up, whether you're American or not. The $16.99(CAD) price tag just isn't justifiable.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/recommended/274190/","somebody336","somebody336","http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/","2760 products in account","Broforce is a 2D Run and Gun game where you are tasked with bringing freedom to the entire world. At least that is what they claim we are doing, as we blow enemy hideouts to smithereens and fly off into the sunset. To accomplish this we are given control of “Bros” which are all parody characters out of popular films such as Rambro, Bro Hard and Bronan the Brobarian. As you can no doubt tell, this is very much a tongue in cheek type of game. Broforce is centered around fast gameplay, epic guitar riffs and destruction above all else and has very little story to speak of. You and up to three friends can join in on the carnage via drop in, drop out online or local coop to deliver fiery freedom to terrorists. Starting off the game you will have the choice of either picking Campaign or Arcade Mode. They are mostly the same except campaign mode gives you an overworld while arcade is just back to back missions. Then you will be given the choice of normal and hard difficulty. It is suggested to start on normal since hard has faster rates of fire, more enemies and placements designed to annoy you.\n\nAt the start of each mission you are given a random Bro that you have unlocked and must make your way throughout the levels saving new Bros for extra lives. Bros all play differently from one another and each have special attacks. For example one bro may only have his fists and be able to send projectiles back at enemies, while another bro throws dynamite and is able to attract enemies via a cooked turkey with dynamite stuffed into it. There are also differences in speed, strength and range between them, so every Bro requires their own play-style, which makes the repetition in this game feel very minimal. To unlock more characters you have to a certain amount of Bros from their cages. The random nature in which you are given Bros is a double edged sword. On one hand you will not be able to rely on the character you are best at and only play as them throughout, but on the other hand some Bros are just not equipped for the task at hand, which will cause you to die until you are given a Bro more suited to the situation. You can retry a mission as many times as you like so it is a minor issue. Unless you are playing on IronBro mode, a permadeath mode that is unlocked later in the game and makes it so each Bro can live only once, once you lose all Bros it's game over.\n\nTo defend yourself you will have melee, ranged and special attacks. Melee and ranged can be used indefinitely while special attacks usage amount varies from character to character. Strangely enough you can only shoot horizontally, so any enemy above or below you is untouchable via weapon fire until they are on the same plane as you. That is unless you get clever with explosives or special attacks to kill them before they know what hit them. The problem with simply jumping below is that enemies have far greater range than most Bros do, so you have to get in rather close to shoot them. Since you die in a single hit that can be an unnecessarily risky move. This game does require a decent amount of foresight before going in guns blazing. You have to consider if there may be enemies hiding in the grass, if you can take out the enemies before they fire at you and shoot an explosive near you, or if it would simply be better if you punch through a wall and make your own path. There is a pleasant amount to consider before making your move and makes it all the more sweeter when you proudly stand alone in an environment torn apart by an intense battle. That is the perfect time to use the button dedicated to flexing your muscles.\n\nEnemies have quite a bit of variety to them and range from dogs, suicide bombers and even supernatural enemies later on. They all have different means of attack and some are able to take a lot of damage. Terrorists have a certain room in which they will infinitely respawn until you destroy the ground under that door, causing them to all fall to their deaths. Sadly, AI is terrible in this game and enemies are very likely to be the cause of their own deaths. If you are spotted the enemy will just stand there and shoot at the direction he last saw you, over and over again until you kill him. The difficulty comes from the traps, enemy numbers and camera which you have no control over. Once you kill an enemy its corpse will provide cover to his friends behind it until you gib it with a few bullets, while enemy bullets can conveniently pass through the body. The camera is far too zoomed in, causing you to be killed by an enemy that was out of view or getting explosives dropped on your head that you had no way of knowing where there on occasions.\n\nYou will also face multiple vehicles like mechs, helicopters and trucks that spawn enemies from it. Out of all the vehicles you can only hijack the mechs by standing on it and pressing the melee button.  These deal some serious damage to everything it comes across, though its ability to move around is based on a very small fuel supply, so it won't last too long. Your main threats will be the crazy bosses in this game.  The amount of destruction they all cause is staggering and it is a joy to take these down. Some will not just die by shooting at it and will require some outside the box thinking. The overall amount of destruction you will see in this game is truly impressive. Nearly anything can be destroyed and the levels usually end up looking like the planet is imploding in on itself. The only things which can't be destroyed is the ground surrounding the American flag which is used as a respawn point. There is quite a bit of levels to play through on the campaign/arcade. It keeps getting crazier and crazier the further in you go until you are eventually fighting on American soil. What little dialogue there is, is delivered via text and adds nothing to the game. The only difference in campaign mode is the over-world I previously mentioned, where you can fly around and run into seagulls because why not, as well as be able to choose which levels to take on first at times.\n\nTo top it off this game supports custom maps via Steam workshop. These can also be played with friends and are just as enjoyable as the ones found in the main game. They can be downloaded right from in game and can also be saved so you can play them offline. These offer much more value to the game and are quite a few of them already. Great music is something Broforce also has, especially that final ending theme song. With its fast paced gameplay, considerable difference between Bros and various ways to tackle levels, it offers plenty of replay value even without the user made content. Its AI is unimpressive to say the least but there is a ton of fun to be had mowing them down in various ways. All levels are perfectly playable if you end up doing it solo and may even be preferable, so you know exactly what is going on, which can be pretty hard when you have three others blowing up the map. At the end of the day this is a great game that plays like a mix of Metal Slug and an extreme version of Dig Dug.  For those still unsure I highly recommend checking out the free game  The Expendabros  to get a taste of what is on offer. Highly recommended to those that like the genre, want an action packed game or simply want a fun game to play with friends.","October 31, 2015","true","10.3"," 105 of 115 people (91%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","91","105","115","9","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sacheverell/recommended/274190/","Sacheverell","Sacheverell","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sacheverell/","451 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nAny game that lets me tear through a horde of bad guys as a Terminator, then lets me tag in Indiana Jones with a high-five for some whip-swinging action, topping the whole thing off with Mister-T pitying a horde of burning fools on his way to the final flag (and red-skinned evil leader), deserves a f**king medal.\n\nEven unfinished, Broforce is everything a platformer game should be: Explosions. Eye-catching graphics. Explosions. Really clever character and weapon designs. Highly satisfying gameplay that just doesn't seem to wear out it's welcome, no matter how many times you blast through a level. It is everything that made 90s action movies great, meshed with everything that made 90s console platformer games great. Die Hard? Demolition Man? A-Team? Contra? If any of those words gave you a nostalgia-boner, then this game is for you.\n\nI don't recommend games very often, because frankly, the latest half-decade of products have been 98% crap. Same old shooters, same old fantasy RPGs, same old everything. This is a refreshing change to the current crop of games, and while it pays homage to a different era of gaming, it does so on its own terms, in its own way.\n\nIf you want to feel like an action hero (or a whole team of them, as the case may be), buy this. If you want to high-five your friend in co-op, buy this. If the idea of bullet-hell or explosions gets you excited, you NEED this game.","April 7, 2014","true","23.4"," 74 of 80 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","74","80","0","0"

I don't think I will write here anything new above everything else that was already said, but this game fully deserves my +1  and besides, I just couldn't recommend it more.\n\nIt features lots of explosions, varied enemies, fully destructible environment (if you overdo it, you can annihilate everything including your way out) and bros - numerous playable characters that parody popular tough guys or gals from movies. Many of them differ wildly from one another in playstyle, and you get them at random (whenever you die or liberate a captive, the game assigns you one from the set you unlocked).\n\nYou can play alone or co-op with up to 3 friends, both online and locally. And if you have someone over at your house, they can join you anytime - even while you're in the middle of a stage, just hand them a gamepad/ keyboard and press a button - it's that easy. There is no friendly fire (you're not taking damage if a friend shoots you directly), but you can kill your co-op partner nonetheless by environment (boulder to the head after destroying the structures too much) or blow them up by triggering explosives they stand next to. But that's ok - even dying is fun in this game.  :D\n\nEverything is fast paced and humorous. You can approach the stages in a more tactical way, or just jump around like a headless chicken & shoot all over- whichever suits you better. You will most likely die much more following the 2nd approach, but due to the random switching of bros you may luck out at some point and push through to the end while having fun all the way. There is much fun to be had - while the stages don't vary that much some may still surprise you, and the bosses are imaginative as well as challenging, ending is just perfect - completing the campaign feels extremely satisfying.\n\nBroforce is crazy fun & provides pure, unfettered joy. It was simply designed with player enjoyment in mind :)","April 29","true","7.9"," 74 of 80 people (93%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","93","74","80","8","0"

Start level\n2. Kill about 80 soldiers to get to the last quarter of the level\n3. Stand there, as The Brominator, dismembering every motherf*cker in sight with your minigun.\n4. Don't notice that installation in the tunnel ceiling.\n5. Giant Spinning Saw Blade comes down from the installation and races across the screen, precisely through the middle of where you stand, speeding towards you like furious spidermokey\n\n10/10 Would get brutally eviscerated again\n\n\n*EDIT* I switched on this game last night, with my son, (as we usually do), and asked myself, "Hold the Holy Hell on a minute!! What's this I see?"\n\nI'll tell you what I saw......THE MOTHERF*CKING BRODATOR AS A PLAYABLE BRO!! (That's The Predator, for you uninformed Mooks).....Yeah, that's right, I know you're a Mook and me and my Bros are coming for your ♥♥♥!!  You thought it was bad getting swiss-cheesed by a minigun? Wait until you feel the Force of Freedom, courtesy of a radar that detects enemies and fires lasers at them automatically from an invisible Brodator!!!\n\n**EDIT AGAIN** 410 hours played so far.......I'm trying to remember things from my past but am having difficulty recalling them.  There's one specific item, I'm sure it's a common occurrence but my mind is failing me at this juncture......Yellow.....No, orange.....or was it red?  I remember heat, and a blue surrounding.......and magnifying glasses focusing beams on to unsuspecting and completely expendable insects......What is it called?  Come on, brain, don't fail me just yet.......Oh!  I think I got it!!  For some reason, I have the word "NUS" in my mind!!  I think I remember seeing this "NUS" sometime in my distant past but my memory of it is dwindling with every custom level that I play on Broforce...NUS?  That doesn't sound right?  USN?  No,..But I think I'm close....anyway, I think....Maybe......Yes, I think I need to get out more...\n\n.....I sometimes have this urge that compels me to open the curtains, unlock my front door and stumble into the street, to try and benefit from the effects of this seemingly wondrous and immortal yellow deity that is known as UNS.....or is it a mythical object thought to live in the sky?...I'm sure that most people know what I'm talking about.....unless they're gamers or geeks, of course.  Like me, all they really know is blowing stuff up, stealing cars, using explicit language, destroying enemies and beating bosses, (also tea-bagging on multiplayer when you get the kill......Yeah, I know, that's old-hat now and is mostly seen as boring by Old School gamers.....but so is drawing on people/shaving somebody's hair/eyebrows off when they've passed out due to too much drink/drugs/furious masturbation, that doesn't mean it's any less funny!!)....all in a minimum of 720p.....Although most of us won't settle for less than 1080p, (goes without saying), which the newer consoles play at, but come on, X-Box/Playstation......Took you long enough to catch up, didn't it?  Now you got even more catching up to do since PCs can run at 4K and now utilise G-SYNC, for the most part, anyway   :DLskull: :nahclown: :mdhappy:\n\nAs a whole, we know nothing of these legendary "Daylight Hours".  Ask us what Project Reality was and you'd better be prepared for an enthusiastic lecture lasting several hours, in which we drop some major knowledge bombs on you but talking to us about the hours of 4am-3pm (04:00 - 15:00)?  You might as well be trying to teach an octopus how to order in some Chinese for a Friday night.......I thought I was emulating the rest of the Human Race correctly 5 weeks ago but the yellow object was white instead and all I felt was a chill as I heard the ravenous, wild dogs that roam these parts dart from shadow to shadow behind me, sometimes stopping to listen to a distant howl from the woods, the padding of their paws getting louder and louder and I can almost smell their fetid breath as they close in......then I feel them circling me in the near mist but can't see into the fog, this is Britain, after all, and everybody knows our fogs are thicker than an elephants spunk-out.........I don't think I'll try to find this thing anymore, I shall wonder no more about this daily happening that I once read gives life to so many creatures and plants on this rock, it seems to be an activity fraught with danger and confusion and can only lead to bad things.......So, instead, I think I'll sit at my computer......Oh, look, Broforce has finished updating.....I wonder what they've added this time? More levels?  Updated Workshop items? New enemies? Even more Bros?   I think I'm going to find out......*STARTS LOADING BROFORCE*.........I can't remember the name of that phenomenon again.....damn wossname?....Memory!!...and the colour of the subject has now drifted from my recollection, it's like the last 5 minutes of my life have been completely erased from my mind.......But it's OK, I have Broforce......\n\nNow then, Updates......So, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so many updates.  They're regular, sometimes adding content, sometimes just bug fixes, but they're there, you see them frequently and each one does something, unlike some Early Access games who pretend they're doing some major work on the game but in reality are just updating the font used and fixing the size of the in-game text because the 5 people who do actually play the game are squinting like constipated moles when somebody shines a torch across their garden in the middle of the night.  These devs also listen....and I do mean LISTEN.....to what their user-base are saying and they act on it as quickly and as much as they possibly can do.  You definitely get a sense of the devs loving this game as much, or maybe even more than, the 98 (that's NINETY-MOTHERF*CKING-EIGHT!!!) percent of users who rated this unfinished game positively, and this shows in the discussions as they're always on there, either making notes of what they might need to change or replying to users who are stuck with a certain aspect of it.  Questions like,\n\n"I bought Broforce and it won't run on my PC.  I start it, it pops up for a second then closes again.  What's the problem?", to which the correct response is,\n\n"Holy Sh*tting f*ckaduck!!  We didn't know there were still people running RIVA TNT2 graphics cards!!".\n\nAt this juncture. on a semi-serious note, I'd like you, yes YOU, to show me any other Early Access game with a 98% positive rating from 8,000+ reviews, seriously, try and find one.....That's right, you CAN'T!! That alone should tell you how god-damn, mamma-jamma-in', dog's-b*ll*ck's, bee's-knees, badger's-'nadgers and other funny, rhyming animal body parts chuffin' awesome this game truly is.","January 22, 2015","true","604.8"," 107 of 133 people (80%) found this review helpful 120 people found this review funny","80","107","133","120","0"

It is a run and gun platformer that serves as a love letter to action movies. There is a large cast of action heroes from Robocop to Mad Max that all use a variety of moves to help spread freedom across the world. Whether you are going on a chainsaw massacre with Ash williams, yelling like Arnie while creating a swordquake slam as Conan, sending bullets back at enemies as Neo, or pitying the fool as Mr. T, Broforce makes you feel cooler than you actually are.\n\nDestructible environments and force switching characters keeps the experience chaotic, fun, and full of risk-reward situations. Gaining an extra life means that you have to give up playing as Blade and will have to adapt to whatever random bro you turn into next. It would be really easy to just use Macgyver to blow up all these enemies, but doing that would make the next jump up a lot harder. Shooting these explosive barrels will make short work of enemies and open up a new path, but it could also send down deadly debris.\n\nThe main campaign has you steering a helicopter around different parts of the world to help spread freedom through a 12 gauge and explosions. The enemies are satisfying fodder, and there are some nice surprises in the form of mechs, bossfights and aliens, with more still to come. Aside from campaign there is an arcade mode that has you running and gunning with no helicopter navigation in between. There are some very early alpha versions of different race like modes that are fun, but not quite up to par with other Bro modes.\n\nOn the local co-op front, deathmatch is a clear winner. My family and friends all have fun jumping in playing with all of these outrageous action heroes. It's an experience that reminds me of Smash Bros, but with more Bro and gore.\n\nEven though this title is Early Access it has like nothing less than non-stop fun, great polish, and awesome updates since my preorder.\n\nWalking away from explosions, highfiving bros for slow motion, throwing satan off a cliff, disembowling enemies, shouting freedom so loud that it terrifies enemies, and so much more, can all be found in bounty in Broforce.","July 2, 2015","true","87.3"," 57 of 63 people (90%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","90","57","63","17","0"

All around me were the corpses of enemies who had been killed by the deadly xenomorphs. I stepped through a passageway and was mortally wounded by acid spit. As I laid there, slipping away into the unknown as enemies flanked me on all sides, John Rambro appeared over me and whispered, "I've got this, bro..."\n\nBroforce is a game I've been playing on-and-off for more than a year, and it still manages to entertain and surprise me with its cheesy 80s bravado, constantly-evolving gameplay and a robust custom level community.\n\nUshering players in with an eagle's cry and a gruff military commander with a rockin' mustache barking orders, the game tasks players with infiltrating various Vietnam outposts and cleaning out the enemy resistance, using one of many different heroes who can be unlocked via rescues. These run the gamut from standard 90s action heroes (like Rambo or the Terminator) to female heroines (Ripley, Cherry Darling) to cult favorites like the Boondock Saints or the Rocketeer.\n\nThere really is no plot to speak of, but you won't care anyway because you'll be too busy spamming burning hot American justice into the hearts of faceless goons to care. Every level features a variety of enemies, traps and challenges to keep players on their toes, and the later stages (as of this writing) pit you against massive alien enemies and hordes of rocket-spamming foes.\n\nOne of the most interesting parts of the game is how fluidly every hero controls, and how many different gameplay mechanics are at work here. Whether it's John Mc-sorry, Bro McClane and Rambro's standard assault rifle spam, Cherry Broling's hover-by-way-of-Princess-Toadstool ability, the Brocketeer's double-jump or the Boondock Bros' AI helper/respawn ability, there's a wealth of ways to complete each level.\n\nThe game is definitely inspired by Contra, and can definitely be punishing in later stages, especially given that while you may have superior firepower, you're about as fragile as tissue paper. Each bro dies in one hit, forcing players to be mindful at times about how many additional lives they have.\n\nThe custom campaign mode is where the game really shines, and what gives it such exceptional replay value. There are a lot of custom maps, ranging from fully-fledged stories to brutally-difficult challenge maps.\n\nThe game is also hilarious when played in co-op or multiplayer mode. I've had the privilege to play this with friends multiple times, and the "rescue a bro, get another player in to help" mechanic works very well. Sometimes it's fun to screw over your friends by blowing out the floor underneath them and letting them fall to their deaths.\n\nBroforce will definitely appeal to anyone who grew up in the 80s or 90s and can laugh at the various references and shout-outs to past franchises. Even for an Early Access title, it's very well-made (barring a few bugs every now and again), and is one of the best retro action platformers available on Steam right now.\n\nIf you don't buy it for yourself, do it for America.","September 11, 2015","true","58.8"," 43 of 48 people (90%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","90","43","48","13","0"

Contra, Commando, The Revenge of Shinobi, all of these games and more were made in a time when John Rambo and John Matrix were the superheroes of the silver screen, and game developers shamelessly translated these characters again and again. Entire genres were created in pursuit of capturing the essence of Rambo in an interactive sense. The developers at Free Lives have perfected this ideal in a way that neither the official Rambo video game or Stallone’s own nostalgia trips can. Simply put, Broforce is the ur-action movie game, combining the ridiculous tone of Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon with an attention to detail that can only come with a true love for that strange and ridiculous time when Arnold and friends shooting and screaming into the forrest was the pinnacle of cinema.\n\nWant to read more?

Mindless fun.  Yes, it's violent.  Yes, chances are you need a particular mindset to enjoy it, but the gameplay is solid and given I'm in no ways American I can still enjoy the light-hearted humour and rarely have I encountered a game where I have laughed so much at my own mistakes and countless deaths.  The fairly constant updates to this game are groovy, too. and in some ways this game reminds me of my love for an oldie but goldie, Gunstar Heroes.  (Which still stands as one of my all time favourites...)\n\nSeriously, don't even be concerned about the Early Access sticker on this product.

It's simple, really: run through a fully-destructible map and slice, shoot, explode, and basically annihilate little men with masks. Even after they're dead, you can chop them up into little pieces. This game pays close, close attention to detail, like attack dogs running up and feasting on any corpse they see, or how the avatar in the corner is animated according to what your character is doing at the time.\n\nHowever, it's not too long at this point: I've gotten a little more than two hours on here.

There's a lot of bang for the buck, it requires little HD space, plays almost completely without bugs (almost? - I didn't discover any so far) and has a really nice atmosphere to the 80's kind of action punch hard, shoot fast, blow up, die hard hero.\n\nYou'll find old friends like Brobocop, Broman the Barbarian and other Snake Plisskin like characters, funny dialogues (really, there are dialogues??), and a kind of irony that will make you chuckle a lot.\n\nHowever, after a while, you can sure overplay it. So, since it takes only little space on the disk - I leave it there, and grab it from time to time and now it has been a loooong time I've played it. It fits very well into the gaps of not knowing what to play because you played it all and are so fed up with it that you think you might focus on your real life again, because maybe, just maybe you're missing out on job, wife, kids, sport and food. F@ck that!\n\nBut - most and foremost: this is absolutely mindless fun, democracy, freedom, 'Murica... all taken with such self irony, that you scream every 2 seconds: open up, mofo, FREEDOM IS HERE! And I am not even American. But this one teaches you HOW to be American, truly American, 'murically American!\n\n'Muricalously it is not the jokes you get fed up with. It's the repeating gameplay.

I really like that the movements are very fluid and allow for a great variety of moves such as wall-jumping or grabbing ledges or sliding down cords.\n\nThe game is both action-packed and violent, yet subtle. The idea to switch between famous action characters with different abilities is great as it creates a lot of variety in the situations. Some characters are melee only, some characters are more suitable for picking off enemies one by one, some characters blow everything up (the levels can be destroyed, and the level design is really well thought in order to give the player solutions to progress). Each character can influence how the player approaches the next place to assault.\n\nThe levels and enemies lack some of that huge variety that the characters have, but as the updates progress there is more and more, allowing for new situations to occur and renew the fun. Although, even as it stands, the game is already very very good and well worth the investment. Easy pick-up fun that I come back to quite often. Already one of my favorite games ever.\n\nThere is a level editor, so the community will keep the game alive and with new content for a while.\n\nIt is possible to play Coop in offline (same screen) or online (might require to open ports) multiplayer. Really adds a LOT to the fun of the game. I think that two players is the sweet spot to play seriously, as if there are more players it becomes very chaotic and the levels get destroyed quickly, sometimes hindering progression.\n\nMy only complaint is that some of the early characters are dull and unoriginal in comparison to the gameplay variety and cool specials that were added later.\nIf you are not sure about Broforce, try out the Expandabros on Steam.","December 24, 2014","true","34.3"," 25 of 26 people (96%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","96","25","26","2","0"

Yes, it is silly, exsplosive, and Mucho 'Murica!', mixed with muscle flexing, funny puns, and playful nods.\n\nThe gameplay - 10/10\n\nPerfectly balanced - I never felt like there was a situation that was unfair or that one character was superior/lesser.\n\nChallenging but never imposilbe - Yes, one bullet can kill you, and, Yes, there are a TON of bullets (all with your name echtched into their firey little bodies) but never are you totally out matched, though it might get a little overwhelming at times, with all the exsplosions and such. The game gives you just the right amount of freedom to tackle all of your problems the way you want, coupled with just enough randomness to make it fresh throughout the 6 or so hour campaign.\n\nIt also features excelent coop. My dad and I played through the whole campaign (somewhere between 30 to 50 maps/levels) over two nights. It was such a blast, with more laughs then our sides could take!\n\nThe level design - 10/10\n\nThe maps were excelent - Fresh, exciting, with funny little nods sprikled about here and there. The destructible makes the games a thousands times more engaging, allowing that freedom and randomness to emerge gloriously. Also with a good amount of both height and depth to the maps, (in my eys) alleviates the staleness that would, over time, set in as some other games do.\n\nThe Music - 8/10\n\nThe rhythms and beats of war drive you on, roaring loudly as you run through the fire and blood. What more could you ask for?\n\nPrice - 7/10\n\nWhen I first saw this game, I had thought that the price was much to high for what it was, but that was before I look into it. After seeing a youtuber play it, just before the Summer Sale, I thought I would give it a shot. I waited for it to go on sale, picked it up, and, after playing it, felt that it's price was right. It's not too high, but if it was a little lower, I would've gotten into it a lot sonner.\n\nMy final verdict is 9/10\n\nIt is an excelent game and should be played by anyone that enjoys very well made action games.","July 25, 2015","true","21.1"," 24 of 25 people (96%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","96","24","25","3","0"

(Oooooo Satire)\n\nI kid obviously, however, honestly I didn't expect to like Broforce, I had seen it come up in my feed, recommendations, anytime I searched for anything, all over the front page, and I had put it in the catergory of "serious BRUH!!!!" Game which has never appealed to me (also in the catergory most games where you play as a sentient slab of meat.) so I never thought to give it a chance, but the amount of games with Local CO-OP on the PC is extremely low, and I found myself, sitting with some friends and becoming more and more attracted to Broforce... I'd stare wistfully at it's title page and wonder "am I maybe being too harsh?"\n\nThe answer dear reader is that yes I was being way too harsh, Broforce is a game that does not take itself seriously in the slightest, it takes on destruction, action movie violence, and fun with the same enthusiasm that usually is reserved for drunken sex... you throw yourself in there, never quite sure which parts are where, but it's working and it feels great!\n\nAlso like drunken sex... it's a lot more fun when someone else is involved.\n\nWhen you first start you will die... with some regularity, but it's never unfair and in taking it's cue from Hotline Miami, and other games of this type, a checkpoint is no more than a button press away, indeed even when you run out of lives the mission failed screen is up for like a second, after that you are right back in the action.\n\nYou will laugh at the movie refrences for the different bros, find yourself remembering the classic films and where they are from, and with each one having unique weapons and special abilites the desire to unlock the next one never gets grindy...\n\nThe destruction is incredible, and I often find myself coming back, just to blow up some dirt. There is very very little to find fault with here, a few bugs here and there, but for an early access title it's incredibly polished, there is a beauty to it despite the pixel graphics, the explosions feel right, the weapons pack a punch! and the variety of enemies will keep you looking for weakspots and fast paced tactics to best smash through them...\n\nAnd then you die because you weren't looking where you were going, and a rock fell on your head.\n\nBut it doesn't matter because unlike the aforementioned drunken sex, you will never for a minute regret the decision to purchase this game. If you don't believe me download the Expendabros (which is free) and try that, Broforce is that but longer.","April 11, 2015","true","35.3"," 18 of 18 people (100%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","100","18","18","14","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BavarianGod/recommended/274190/","BavarianGod","[AReV]BavarianGod","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BavarianGod/","3478 products in account","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1eRArgmxAI\n\nThe testosterone rich action films of the 1980s and early 90s have no doubt inspired generations of game developers, providing a metric ton of material to repackage into shooters and hack and slash titles both contemporary and classic. Of course, over time those sources of inpiration have become fodder for parody and irrevrent jabs at what was once considered the pinnacle of awesome. Broforce has risen like a phoenix from the faded pixels of Contra and Metal Slug wearing the war paint of Stallone and Schwarzenegger. This side scroller cropped up on steam's early acces page three years ago and has finally emerged as a finished product, poised to flex it's biceps and set the world on fire in the name of bromance.\n\nBroforce places you in the boots of any number of parodies of iconic action film characters from the past 35 years of action and sci-fi cinema. There is Brochete, Rambro, Snake Broskin, Brobocop and 26 other bros ready to burn, blast and blow through any anti 'Merican, ski mask wearing, AK wielding meat bag. Select a level, warm up you hammies, decorate the environment with lead and get to the chopper—wash rinse and repeat until every American can sleep soundly at night knowing that the bros have mulched every terrorist on earth.\n\nBroforce plays like a mash up between Metal Slug, Contra and Terraria, forcing players to blow through various enemy types and rescue hostages in a completely destructable environment. Each time you spawn you take control of a random Bro. Rescuing hostages unlocks additional characters and each one has a unique weapon and a special attack with finite uses. The Brominator wields a mini gun that has to wind up before it fires and has nasty recoil that sends the player backwards. Ash Broliams has his short range boom stick that excels at shredding the environment and terrorist scumbags. Taking control over random Bros keeps players on their toes but it can also be annoying when you have character that is ill suited to the task at hand. Fighting bosses with melee focused characters can get irritating and some characters can completely break levels by making them too easy. Cherry Broling for instance has an assault rifle for a leg which can be used to fly short distances. This allows her to fly over enemys in relative safety giving enemies a lead shower or simply skipping obstacles altogether. Also, when in multiplayer, randomly swapping between character can make it difficult to keep track of who you are controlling. This leads to unnecassary deaths and some frustration. As it should be, broforce is a chaotic game and this is only magnified by adding more players to the mix. The end result is that anything more than two players becomes a handicap since your real life Bros will  be too busy felxing to notice they are blowing up barrels right next to you or causing large rocks to collapse on your player's dome. Also, when cutscenes displaying newly unlocked characters pause the action mid game ruining your rhythym and ultimately getting you killed. It's all good fun, but don't expect to progress as a well oiled unit. Also, initiating a multiplayer bromance involves navigating a terrible lobby that doesn't display the host nor who is currently in the lobby.\n\nThe real problem with Broforce is that it's mechanics are more flaccid phallus than bulging biceps and when the novelty of it's screaming rock soundtrack and goofy characters wares off you have a game that doesn't offer any challenge in terms of platforming, the gunplay has little variety since enemies are not very dynamic and  the destructible environments allow you to cheese you way through the game if you feel inclined. The main campaign I only lasts a few hours and there is a map editor to tinker with and other players creations can be downloaded but there just isn't much to ensure that the gameplay remains compelling. It's not kind of stuff that will make a god damned sexual tyrannosaurus out of anyone...\n\nThe visuals in Broforce do a great job of keeping the tone light and when all hell breaks loose, it looks fantastic to see a Jackson Pollack painting of bloody and fiery pixels engulf the screen. Vehicle designs have the same stubby cartoonish quality as the art in Metal Slug characters are also cartoony and awesomely ridiculous. It's a shame that the game offers so few environment types. The rock tunes give the game that 80's action film feel but over extended gameplay sessions they can be obnoxious.\n\nBroforce is a solid title that is good for a few laughs and will tickle the nostalgia bone of players who grew up on games like Contra and Metal Slug and please movie buffs with it's large cast of action flick inspired bros. However, it relies too heavily on it's novelty offering up mediocre gameplay. Anyone looking for a game relying on the cheesy testosterone fueled attitude of 1980s action cinema would probably be better served by paying Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon. Broforce is a solid game that just doesn't have what it takes to live up to the classics it tries to emulate.","April 8","true","4.6"," 26 of 33 people (79%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","79","26","33","4","0"

The gun play is fast, colorful, with explosions and blood flying across your screen like the 4th of July fireworks show. The game has expanded a lot since it's initial appearance on steam, so it gets a plus for steady developer support. IMO this game works best with friends, where Neo, Rambo, Robocop and more can fight side by side in the middle of the Vietnamese jungles. Alone the game can begin to bore you, so consider that when going to purchase. The game is not a very demanding one graphically, so most current pc users should be able to play with no issue. Remember the game is still not finished so expect features to be tweaked and others possibly added.\n\nOverall this game is a barrel of laughs with friends and provides a lot of value.

I bought it a few years ago, and despite already finishing it, I still continue to play it. The gameplay is simple; You have a character (which the game chooses at random from the 34 available) and you have to get to the end of the level. The characters are all modeled after popular action-movie characters, such as The Terminator, Rambo, and Ellen Ripley from Alien. However, each character's name is changed to include the word 'bro.' For example, the characters I just named are The Brominator, Rambro, and Ellen Ripbro.\n\nEach character has three attacks: their primary attack, a melee attack and a special ability. Most characters have some form of firearm for their primary attack, all with varying strengths and firerates, while other characters have swords or other weaponry. Different characters have similar melee attacks, though some have special traits. For example, Predator, Machete and Ash Williams (from The Evil Dead) can scare enemies who are in proximity to the enemies that you killed. The special abilities are where the characters vary the most, and these abilities can really give you an edge on your opponents. The abilities vary from airstrikes, lightning strikes, missile barrages, and even deflecting bullets.\n\nThe game's graphics look great. The pixel graphics match the light-heartedness of the game, and the colours used really reflect what is happening in the environment. The sounds match the game well too. All the weapons sound good, and the explosions always sound glorious. The music is simple action-movie music with a heavy drumbeat. Although this matches the theme of the game, it doesn't really add anything.\n\nThe game also features three different gamemodes. The first is the Campaign, which is your standard gamemode. This mode involves completing the levels in order via the world map. The second gamemode is Arcade Mode, which is the same as Campaign Mode, except you can choose which level you start from (assuming you have completed that level before), along with removing the world map and all cutscenes. The final gamemode is the Ironbro Campaign, which is by far the hardest. In this gamemode, once you run out of lives, it's game over, and once a character dies, they will not return until game over.\n\nPROS\nThe game is certainly fun to play, and never loses its charm.\nAll the characters feel different, and are fun to play as (no matter how many times I blame a character when I die)\nThe game mixes up the environment occasionally, sending you into jungles, cities, underground, and even to Hell!\nThe achievements are challenging to earn, especially the character specific ones.\nBroforce's difficulty slowly increases as the game goes on, allowing you to improve as the game gets harder.\nThere is a boss fight at the end of every mission, which are all unique and difficult in their own way.\nThe ending (no spoilers)\nKilling birds on the World Map screen is a good stress-reliever.\nLevel editor with Steam Workshop support.\nUp to 4-player co-op.\nCONS\nSometimes the deaths seems unfair, and make you question how you actually died.\nThis isn't really that negative, however I would've liked some more variety in music.\nSome characters appear much more often than others, which means that you don't get to see some of your favourites very often.\nSummary:\nI've loved this game since the first time I played it. I'd recommend this game to anyone that enjoys 2D shooters, action heroes, or action games. Even after you complete the campaign, there are still more things to do, like playing levels from the workshop or attempting the Ironbro Campaign.\n\nRating:\nI'd give Broforce a 10/10, as this game certainly Terminates the competion.","April 18","true","158.4"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","85","17","20","4","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/274190/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2819 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nBroforce was a game which I had watched people play on YouTube and thought it was just another fancy platformer shooter game with the added twist of action adventure movie heroes. While the game is exactly all of those things, it also has many other redeeming points.\n\nThe gameplay is overwhelmingly simple. There is nothing wrong with an easy game to play. I for one enjoy games where you can pick it up and play no matter what mood you are in. The fast paced action makes for a brilliant casual game to play when you have a few minutes to kill.\n\nStorywise, there is none. From what I gather anyway. It's just a matter of shooting through hoards and hoards of bad guys and saving your chums who have been kept prisoner. The reward system is based on how many prisoners you actually rescure, and the rewards you get equate into new playable characters, or "Bros". You start off with being able to play Rambo and you work your way through to the likes of Conan the Barbarian, or Broman the Brobarian....\n\nCompleting the main game is very short, I managed to do it in roughly two hours of picking up and playing every now and again. There are still plenty of other game modes such as Arcade, coop, (online and local) as well as a level editor which will add hours of endless mindnumbing badguy killing frenzies.\n\nI would highly recommend this game for anyone who enjoys a shooting or action game. You cannot go wrong, and the devs are bound to add more features and levels in the future.","October 24, 2014","true","1.1"," 30 of 44 people (68%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","68","30","44","4","1"

I almost felt as if Conan the Brobarian was my own flesh and blood. I couldn't believe how well made this game was.\n\nThe plot is deep, having you plunged into the war against terror as one of many iconic war heroes, such as the Terminator, Blade, and Chuck Norris.\n\nThe gripping campaign had me on the edge of my seat for hours, unknowing of what twist will happen next.\n\nI can say that Broforce is probably the greatest game I own on Steam.

The way you get there is at your discretion, though. The terrain gets blasted away by your weaponry the same as any enemy; in keeping with the Minecraft/Spelunky zeitgeist, tunneling through 20 feet of concrete with a shotgun is as valid a way to the level's end as any other. Such freedom opens up some interesting strategic possibilities, like shooting the floor out from underneath an otherwise imposing foe. It also makes for some zany, unpredictable runs, especially when you're paired with trigger-happy teammates who don't give much thought to blowing up the platform you're standing on. The campaign can be taken online, and there are a few local multiplayer diversions on offer, like a player-versus-player deathmatch, and another variant that sees characters fleeing an encroaching blast from the left side of the screen.","June 7, 2015","true","9.1"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","0"

Each character have their own unique weapon and special, though some character is cleary better than some character. TimeBro, the hero that can slow down time can wipe out the whole multiplayer game if use correctly. Character like Conan the Brobarian is rather a cameo than a useful heroes. Whenever you die, you will get a random heroes that you had rescure from POW, but randomizing the character sometimes feels like your game is up to luck rather than skill.\nBroforce side scrolling is fun and memorable, because the game map can be compeleted in many ways. For example you can choose to gun down all enemies, or you can dig under them and get behind them, or you can just rush to the end of the level. The game rarely have glitches, even if it does have glitches it didn't affect the gameplay. Terrain are destroyable by shooting it and barrels explode when they are shot. The game will sometime have some difficulty spikes at the end of the level by decreasing the number of POW you can rescue, which can make the games less fun and more stressing.\nEnemy AI is rather stupid, and it makes the game enjoyable because it makes you feel like a badass after killing tons of them. There are many enemies type that are based on some movies like the Alien. Bosses are awesome and huge, making killing them more fun than ever.\n\nStoryThe story of this game is not the focused one, just a bad guys capturing territories of the worlds. Sometimes the game show cutscene that are funny and worth a laugh. If you like to focus on story, this is not your game.\n\nMusic and ArtThe game music is not that much, but when it did had music it was epic. The music mostly is rock themed music, and the game art is great reminding you of the old day of gaming. The explosion which is also the star of the game is better than ever.\n\nConclusion\n+Great artstyle and Music\n+Explosion\n+Many roster of character\n+Memorable Gameplay\n-Difficulty spikes at near game ends\n-Random character when gaining pow sometimes make the game depends on luck\n-Little Glitches\n8.5/10 Kill everybody with timebro in multiplayer\nNope it suck/ Meh it is something/ Must Buy!","December 6, 2015","true","17.3"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","13","14","0","0"

This is the perfect game to play with a group of friends (up to 4 player online and local co-op), and if you get tired of the main story or deathmatch, there is a level editor to create your own masterpiece.

From Rambo to Terminator to Plisken to John McClane i pitty the fool who doesn't love this insane lineup of recognizable action heroes with their unique weapons that lead to for example Mr. T having a flamethrowher while John Matrix goes crazy with a Mini Gun (altough it was Jesse Ventura who used that weapon in Commando)\n\nAnd it's just like Metal Slug: go from left to right, jump around in an open environment you can shoot and explode to pieces while using vehicles like tanks to your advantage while killing several tons of enemies which leads to a crafty guitar riff played at the end showing that you really are an american bro fighting for peace.\n\nThis game really shines in multiplayer, get some friends in there to liberate countries the commander in the game has no clue about but suspects there might be weapons of mass destructions or they are just evil because they're not american.","October 29, 2015","true","3.0"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","87","13","15","2","0"

Get some friends and a steady supply of coins and you'd get multi-player gaming action unparalleled at the time.\n\nGiven that this is 2014, that Broforce could be perceived as a 1980's game could be considered as a knock, but Broforce so boldly embraces the old school, so lovingly evokes the spirit of 80's and 90's action games and movies, that it feels brilliantly refreshing.\n\nEverything is pared down to focus on out and out, balls to the wall action. With little in the way of presentation or story you begin the game as a randomly selected Bro, an often charming parody of a popular 80's/90's action hero with parodies of Robocop, Rambo,Terminator and Ellen Ripley included to name just a few, each with a custom weapon load out and a distinct play style.\n\nThe aim of the game is to battle your way through the end of each tightly constructed and enemy laden level, take out the oddly weak and passive demon suited guys that wait at the end and leap onto a helicopter ladder to escape to glory. On the way you'll find other captured Bros in cages; free them and you take on their persona, your prior Bro being saved as a 'life', a well implemented system that ensures you're encouraged to try all the different gameplay styles each Bro offers, rather than just sticking with a well-worn favourite.\n\nThe side scrolling 2D gameplay is beautifully measured, with each tiny but perfectly formed Bro sprite capable of running and jumping with a Super Mario Bros like precision, whilst wielding an awesome array of weapons with slick gun play akin to Metal Slug, Contra, and Gunstar Heroes.\n\nBroforce is already a potent mix with those attributes but it ramps up the ante by having almost fully destructible environments with some of the best explosions seen in any game, or in any medium for that matter. They've fully captured the excessively destructive spirit from their beloved influences. Many of Broforce's explosions are simply put, epic.\n\nOne hastily thrown grenade could just as likely lead to a chain reaction and blow yourself up as it could take out an enemy, so this explosive element quickly becomes integral to the gameplay, leading to some surprisingly tactical play options depending on what Bro you may be playing at that time.\n\nThe armed enemy forces are simple but varied fodder, that can regardless still handily punish any careless Bro, with a selection of well realised and balanced bosses featured at the end of selected levels. The varying play styles of each Bro offer different ways to tackle each enemy - one Bro might simply blow up the platform the enemy stands on - one might jump and shoot from long range - one might attack from close range with melee - there really are a lot of ways to approach each scenario.\n\nBut the true mayhem ensues when playing the drop-in, drop-out online multiplayer. Up to 4 players can co-op and it is in this mode that some of the best fun is to be had. Much of the time you'll be unwittingly exploding the hell out of one another, as screen filling explosions erupt and Bros fall to their doom, often with hilarious (or infuriating) results.\n\nThough it's just as likely to get a cohesive team and it soon becomes evident what a great co-op game this can be, each Bro can complement the other, and with 4 at once from a huge range of Bros, it's rare you'll encounter the same combo twice offering a great deal of variety.\n\nStill an early access game, Broforce offers many other modes at varying stages of completion and even offers a custom level design utility, with hundreds of custom maps ready to play and many more appearing on the horizon.\n\nEven at this early stage, Broforce offers a lot for the asking price and is definitely one of the most promising early access games yet released.\n\nUnfinished it may be but it offers almost instant gameplay gratification - no fuss, no filler, just good old school explosive arcade action.\n\n\n(Final score reserved for release of final retail version.)","October 21, 2014","true","20.3"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

I haven't heard anybody that's played it that didn't like it, so I gave it a shot and man...I love it!  With my limited experience with E.A., this has to be one of the best 'non-complete' games I've played yet.\n\nThe game play is straight forward and simple; rescue bros, shoot bad guys, blow ♥♥♥♥ up!  And man, it is so fun.  The terrain is highly destructible, so your sense of causing utter destruction is really grand.\n\nWhile the game play itself is simple, the games difficulty is quite tough.  You will die, frequently.  You're going to swear a lot too. But with the game's restart feature, it's painless to just keep coming back and trying over and over until you can get through to the end.  Different unlocked bros have different skills as well. Some are shot guns, some are machine guns, some have grenades, some have knives.  They each add a great little spin on the game to keep it fresh and exciting. And on top of all that?  This game's pretty funny too!\n\nNow again, this is Early Access.   So the game's incomplete.  Which blows my mind, because in its current state, Broforce is a blast.  (Pun intended.) The developers, Free Lives, are adding content to this regularly, so there's also no fear of this becoming abandoned.  Just last week they added two new bros and some game play tweaks to go with them.  It's a really solid outfit and if this isn't on your wish list yet, I'd add it a.s.a.p!","July 13, 2014","true","4.6"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

Each character has his/her own weapons/playstyle that you use to get to the end of the level. On the way, you will kill all sorts of bad dudes.

Rescue one, and you get one extra life starting from the nearest checkpoint. The twist is you become a different BRO from the varied list of unlocked characters. This also happens when you die.\n\nFurthermore....\n-4 player coop\n-Basically unlimited levels (community built).\n-A level editor\n-Harder modes if you ever (how could you) find it too easy.\n- Levels are physics-based and are fully destructable.

This game is basically the 80’s with more testosterone.\nLength: 3 hours\nScore: 8/10\nReview Date 2015-04-02 (Early Access)\n\nFull Review: Broforce is a game very much influenced by 80’s action movies. As a fan of this kind of movie (though I’ve not seen all the ones this game takes influence from), it’s a pretty fun thing to play.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty simple; it’s a 2D shooter that takes a lot of influence from Contra. That said, it’s also a lot easier of a game. You move left to right, shooting your enemies, and destroying the environment. In fact, that’s part of the fun. Everything goes boom, and you can destroy most of the environment. If one path through a level isn’t working out so hot for you, you can blow up some of the terrain and see if you can go around.\n\nThe character you play as dies in one hit, so you do need to show some caution while playing, but thankfully not too much, allowing you to still run into danger with a headstrong reckless abandon. You start each level with one life, but you can collect more in the level, you’ll receive one extra life every time you rescue a bro.\n\nAnd that’s one of the things we need to focus on for this review. The bros. Each bro is based on various characters from different movies, tv shows, and even comics; and each one plays differently. Most of the bros are based on 80’s action movie heroes, but we’re also treated to characters from earlier and later time periods. The core mechanics for the bros give you a main attack, which you can use as much as you want, and a special attack, which you have only a limited number of (1-6, depending on the bro).\n\nThe levels have cages scattered throughout them, containing captured bros. Each time you rescue a bro the game will automatically switch your character to a random bro, and give you another life. You unlock new brows to play as by increasing the total number of bros you’re rescued. When you die in a level, you’ll re-spawn from the last checkpoint as another random bro.\n\nAll this talk of bros begs the question, who are the bros featured in this game? Well, I won’t list all of them since part of the fun is being surprised, but I will talk about a few of them. When you first start the game, you play as Rambro (yes, all the bros have “bro” in their name, usually as a pun on either their name, or their franchise’s name). This is of course a pretty solid choice to begin the game with. Both as he’s an iconic action hero, and in game he’s armed with a machine gun and grenades, making it easy to dive right into the action and get to shooting.\n\nAs for the other bros, I was quite happy to see that Bro Hard (John McClane) included, and they even left him barefoot, which is a pretty nice touch. I was also pretty happy (and surprised) to see Bro Dredd (Judge Dredd) included, who’s gun fires bullets that both have (limited) homing abilities, and bounce off walls, (another nice touch, managing to incorporate two of his bullet types from the comics, heat-seeking and ricochet). Another fun one I was happy to see (though much less surprised) was Robrocop. The Terminator also makes an appearance, with a powerful gatling gun, and he’s a lot of fun to play as. Some of the other bros (with their non-broified names) included are Snake Plissken (Escape From New York), Blade (Marvel Comics), Men In Black, Neo (The Matrix), Indiana Jones, and quite a few others.\n\nSo, let’s talk about some of the weapons the different bros have. Machine guns are par for the course, with quite a few bros packing rapid fire heat. Others have more unique firearms, with shotguns, homing shots, spread guns, and more populating the game’s arsenal. Others opt for more literal firearms, and by that I mean a flamethrower. While others take less modern weapons, such as swords, knives, and whips; still others go for the future route, with high tech lasers and futuristic guns. And some simply prefer to do their dirty work with just their fists. As for some of the special weapons available for use, the bros are equipped with things like grenades, cluster bombs, Molotov cocktails, more powerful gun attacks, the ability to call down an air strike, and even a giant exploding turkey. The weapon variety is a lot of fun, and along with the selection of bros, is one of the game’s greatest strengths. Though sadly, some of the bros are less effective than others. Sometimes the difference is small, and sometimes it’s quite large.\n\nThe game’s graphics are done in a simple pixel art style, in the vein of old school shooters, though it looks a bit more polished than those of yore. They’re pleasant to look at, and I don’t have any real complaints about them.\n\nThe story and the setting for the game are pretty simple, you’re sent into a war zone, and must fight for freedom. It feels a bit too “America, ♥♥♥♥ yeah” for me at times, but it’s easy to overlook once you start shooting and making things go boom again. The final levels in the game pit you against alien invaders from another world, clearly inspired by the Alien franchise. (And they are the best levels in the game).\n\nThe game also features support for multiplayer fun, and while I only took a brief excursion into this myself, it was pretty good fun.\n\nI should also note that while you can play the game with a keyboard, this is one of those games that is far better when played with a controller. As such, I’d highly recommend using an X-Box 360 controller for Windows when playing Broforce.\n\nNow, the game itself is very short. The campaign mode will only take about a mere 3 hours to play through, and while it’s a lot of fun, it does leave one wanting for more. Thankfully, the game is still early access, so we should get more levels in the future. Even if we don’t, the game is still a blast, and certainly worth playing, but at its current length it’s probably better to pick it up on sale, instead of paying the full $15 for it. That said, the new levels that were added just before I purchased the game (the Alien Infestation update) were thrilling, and while there weren’t too many of those included, they were easily some of the best in the game. If this is the kind of content that future updates will be, then I very eagerly look forward to more.\n\nIf you’re still not quite sure on if you should pick up Broforce or not, you could grab The Exependabros on Steam for free. It’s a game that features characters from The Expendables 3, but set in Broforce style levels. It’s not as good as the actual Broforce game, but it works pretty well as a demo if you need a little convincing before plunking down your cash for this one. (Or if you simply need more Broforce action after completing this game, go grab it for a quick hour long romp).\n\nWhen all’s said and done, Broforce is a hell of a lot of fun, and being able to fight your way across levels as an assortment of different characters with different weapons is quite enjoyable. Give it a chance, start blowing ♥♥♥♥ up with your favourite action heroes.","April 2, 2015","true","11.2"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

Easy to pick up for 15 min, clear a level or two, and then go do something else.  The style is also really funny.  This is the only early access game I have not regretted buying.

They were over the top, stupid, and loud as hell- Everything America stands for. And they were great.\n\nBROFORCE toes the same line as many of those old action flicks.  It's a celebration of testosterone, bullets, and bombs, taken to the nth degree +1. If Stephen Colbert and Torgue Flexington developed a game, it would come out a lot like this.\n\nAnd it's magnificent.\n\nThe controls are better than you'd think with a keyboard. They're tight. Responsive. It takes getting used to, and a controller would be better, but it's not bad.\n\nThe gameplay is simple and open-ended in a great way. You could go all out and dive straight in like a madman. You could take your time and pick out the best possible attack route... Or you could defeat your enemies by exploiting the environment, which is the most patriotic way.\n\nAll that aside, BROFORCE is one of the few games I've played in a while that's just plain fun. No intricate plot. No dark, brooding hero. No 'LOOK AT HOW GRIMDARK AND BROWN THE WORLD IS, BLOO BLOO BLOO'. You shoot, stab, and explode your way through everything ( including your friends ) in a colorful world, and laugh the whole time.\n\nAwesome.\n\n","January 5, 2015","true","8.0"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","91","10","11","4","0"

Behind the poor name lies an action standalone great. Effing simple to learn, this is a platformer at its core. It has lots of action, explosions, and gunplay. One of my favorite parts is all of the Bros. The developers took inspirations for some of the action movie greats, including Terminator, Robocop, Aliens, Timecop, Boondock Saints, Rambo, Commando, the A Team, Walker Texas Ranger, Blade, Judge Dredd, Men In Black, Metal Gear solid, Indiana Jones, Evil Dead, The Matrix, Machete, Conan, Universal Soldier, Mad Max, and more! I also really liked fighting the xenomorphs (aliens). They looked, bled, and died like Ripley's bad guys, eggs and all. If a facehugger gets you, you inflate like a balloon, pop, and out comes an alien. You have an unlimited primary weapon and a limited secondary weapon. You don't take damage, but rather die, and out pops a new Bro! POWs can be given weapons and used as soldiers. Captured Bros lie waiting in cages--the more you free, the more Bros you unlock for use.

It is not meant for keyboard controls in the slightest. One of the best dollar-to-fun ratio's I've ever had on steam. The $11 I paid for this was a steal. One of the most fun experiences you can have playing online. The single player is also incredible. The game is hilarious and lots of action movie badasses are in it, my favs probably being Snake Plissken and Ash Williams. Game is VERY fun and very well made. Constant explosions, gunfire, and death. It is pure insanity non-stop. The controls are somewhat loosey goosey but it is not a true platformer and does not have spike traps/death traps on every inch of ground so the slightly loose control is okay after you get used to it and get better at the game which shouldn't take long. The game will be very frustrating at times though so you really need some good skills to finish without retrying lots of times and even when you do it's still fun. Everything is done well too. The sounds, music, new-age retro graphics, art direction, gameplay, enemies hilarious screams, weapons, levels, and effects are all solid. It has enough explosions and killing for the biggest action movie fan in the world (pretty much me) so you need to buy this and get in game and be a man and completely demolish entire levels with your manly instruments of pain.\n\nBe a man, pony up the dough for this game, and add me so we can do a high five that shakes mountains like Schwartzenegger and Carl Weathers did at the beginning of Predator. Firin' rockets like a god damn boss, son.\n\n9/10 BOSS MODE, SON!\n\nProtip #1 - Buy this\nProtip #2 - Add me so we can jam\nProtip #3 - Show no mercy","November 22, 2014","true","16.7"," 21 of 33 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","21","33","0","0"

The game is currently still on Early Access, but has a lot going for it to buy it right now. There are currently a total of 19 Bros (characters) in the game you can play as. From Rambro to Brobocop, and each has their own unique abilities.\n\nThe missions you take on are pretty straight forward, kill every enemy in the level and get out. On your way you can rescue survivors, these will help you towards unlocking new characters, but also count as extra lives during that level. Plus you can pretty much destroy everything in the level. which is always a fun thing to do.\n\nAs i mentioned the game is still being worked on and there is still a lot to come to make it even better. If you like pixel art and shooting things up while playing as Chuck Norris or Rambo then you should already have gotten the game, if not then i would highly recommend you grab a copy of the game.

If not, then you're probably just not an American but you're wishing you were.\n\nBroforce is all about blowing ♥♥♥♥ up. That's basically the game. You play as various action movie heroes as you liberate Vietnam from Satan himself. The defining point of the game is it's randomness, most notably in how character selection works. When you start a level, you spawn as a random Bro and only get 1 life. As you move through the level, you find cages with other Bros trapped inside. When you break a cage and rescue a Bro, your character immediately swaps out with another random Bro, and gain an extra life. As you keep rescuing Bros, you eventually unlock more Bros to play as. The system works great, as it forces you to learn every character and makes sure that you can't play favorites. This really helps in a game like this where there's a lot of recognizable faces. Hell, if there was a character select I would probably just go Ash or John Matrix (Commandbro) all the time, the former of which I'm not very good with.\n\nThe characters aren't the only random element of the game, though. Enemies and various items spawn differently every time you restart a level. So if you lose all your lives and restart the level (I should probably get into that for a second, you don't get a Game Over when you lose all your lives. You just restart the level), that one regular grunt may now be a kamikaze, and that propane tank may be a red explosive barrel. This means that you can't use the same strategy every time you play the level. You have to adapt, and adapt quickly because there's ♥♥♥♥ blowing up everywhere and you need to ♥♥♥♥ing run.\n\nThe levels aren't randomly generated, but the game makes up for that by making them fully destructable. This opens up so many new ways to play. Do you want to run straight through, killing everyone you see, or break through the ground and sneak away? Do you want to scale the walls to get away from a pack, or quickly peek your head around them and see them all freak out and end up killing themselves somehow because the AI is designed to be incompetent? Is there a big-♥♥♥ robot that you don't wanna tango with right now? Break the ground below him and let him fall to his death! The possibilites are endless! One of the most impressive parts of the levels is that no matter how much you blow up, you can't seem to break the game. It seems like there's no way to trap yourself. I don't know how, but you can always seem to get through the level.\n\nThe enemies in this game are hilarious. Like I said, the AI is built to be incompetent. If a pack sees you, they'll go ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. It's ♥♥♥♥ing great to die by a pack of enemies, then come back to see that some idiot shot a propane tank and managed to kill the entire group, destroy the enemy clown car, and you had nothing to do with it. Not to mention that their voice lines always manage to get a rise out of me. In fact, all the voice lines in Broforce are great, especially the announcer's.\n\nThere's also something to be said about the soundtrack. There's only about four songs in the game, but there's all great, especially the boss music.\n\nOne more thing about the gameplay, do not be fooled. It may seem like you're an invincible death machine at first, but the game gets maddeningly difficult later on, as in, "Threat Level: Black" difficult. As hard as that was though, they're not even finished developing the campaign. Be afraid. Be very very afraid.\n\nI haven't played the multiplayer yet because NONE OF MY FRIENDS OWN IT, but it's probably pretty good.\n\nIn conclusion, even in beta Broforce is a great game, and it's really shaping up to be something incredible. I highly recommend it.\n\nSCREAMING EAGLES/10","July 28, 2014","true","24.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Sure, you start out with the one Bro who has guns, but soon, you're unlocking melee-only bros, bros that only have flamethrowers and bombs, bros with certain perks that dramatically affect the way you play the game. You don't get to choose your Bro, the Bro chooses you, and like any good action hero, you gotta kill liberate them all with the cards you've been dealt. That's Bro life.\n\nI would like Broforce more if the difficulty curve didn't spike like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, however. Most levels are pretty much you getting the hang of Bros and creating cool explosions that fill the screen and liberate everyone in view! However this kind of thing doesn't really mesh all that well with the bosses, which are more of your Contra-sidescroller fare. One moment, you're improvising with explosives and bullets on very squishy goons, the next you've gotta figure out how the hell you're going to destroy liberate this giant tank with eight sections or push force-feed hot dogs to a Bro in a mech suit off the cliff. It's two different kinds of gameplay styles that don't mesh all that well together.\n\nBut god dammit, when it works, it works. It's one of the smartest dumb action games I've played in a while, and I can't wait to see what the final version is going to look like.","August 23, 2014","true","1.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","2"

You have come to the right place, brother or sister, Broforce deliveres this all in truck or helicopter loads, fueling your power fantasies, one shell at a time.\n\nBut to be more serious, Broforce is a really fun game, lots of eye candy all over the place.\nThanks to next-gen particle effects and the pure amount of explosions being able to be rendered all over your screen, it can get rather confusing at times but i'm not saying thats even a bad thing.\nIn short: very nice to look at.\n\nThe movement system allows for a bunch of ways to swing you butt over all that non-american soil and if all your gracious parkour moves fail, you can still blast your way through that pesky terrorist wall, keeping you from turning the bad guys on the other side to a red pulp on the temporary floor.\n\nThanks to hords of enemys and lots of bros to play as, variaty is guaranteed for at least the first hours of playing, up until you've unlocked and figured out the best way to play as every bro and can speedrun your way through all story missions.\n\nBut thats the part where the level editor comes in.\nAre you creative? Like to build 2D levels? Like to add tiny details that oh so often slip by most players in their unsadisfiable thirst for blood? Good, because Broforce got you covered, althought in it's current state the level editor isn't all that userfriendly, so i hope you like exploration too.\n\nBut lets say you don't feel very creative or are just plain lazy.\nNot a problem, you can play levels, other Bros put together and uploaded for public enjoyment and there are levels being added every couple of days, just don't expect there to already be a new level uploaded as soon as you reload the level browser (yet).\n\nWhat gets on my nerves, and thats not even the developers fault, is that there are so many co-op exclusive modes that i can't play because non of my friends can handle the freedom being dealt out in here.\nThis means, people like me will feel like missing out on maybe 25-30% of extra game content.\nBut hey, there is a way around that if you aren't entirly like me and don't mind playing with strangers around the globe, because there is actually the option to play online!\n\nThe worst thing i could honestly say about this game is that, even thought it has a level editor and an active community building new levels and, the possibility to play online with friends or strangers, it can get stale after some time of playing, so taking a break for a few days or even weeks after you got bored is advisable, wouldn't want you dragging your gun along the ground, out of pure unmotivation, while boredly stabbing Terrorist #1369 again.\n\nSo all in all, if you've got some money to blow on games, why not give this very entertaining and gory, if a bit mindless at times, Freedom Simulator a chance?","July 4, 2014","true","103.0"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Humanure/recommended/274190/","Humanure","Belphegore","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Humanure/","1598 products in account","I refuse to buy Early Access titles, due to reasonable reasons. I really wanted to get into Broforce in the EA stage, but I held off. When I heard it finally released, I picked it up...  I'm glad I did, because I'm digging the fully polished and completed game. The Devs are STILL adding to the game! They're completely active in the forums. They listen to their fans and their community, which is one thing that developers sorely lack on most of the time.\n\nSo, onto the actual game. There are over 70 levels for you to blast, shoot, maim and explode your way through. When they say "fully destructible everything", they really mean it! I've been looking for a game that's as close to Metal Slug as you can get, and I actually think Broforce is BETTER than the Metal Slug franchise; I never thought I'd say that about any game. It's a high adrenaline run-and-gun title, overflowing with explosions and enemies.\n\nNot only do you have so many levels to stomp through, but you have TONS of Bros to unlock! What's even better is that they're all tongue-in-cheek references to actual movie and TV characters; Ash Brolliams for Ash Williams from Evil Dead, MacBrover for MacGuyver, etc. They all come with their own special abilities and subsequent downfalls, which makes the game balanced overall. The team behind this game have really put a lot of thought into every detail. Their love and dedication really shows through the incredible attention to detail, balanced gameplay, and unique characters.\n\nIf you're hesitating or waiting for a reason to buy Broforce... DON'T! Just pick it up, you will be glad that you did. With a ton of replayability factors, tough battles, insane amount of Bros, awesome music, and an art style that just never gets old, Broforce is THE arcade style run-and-gun game of 2015; hell, probably even the next five years. The game is constantly expanding with free updates and new content. You can't go wrong with this one.\n\nRating: 5.0/5.0 - An amazing achievement, this game must be played.Belphegore's Hell House Reviews (Group)","October 16, 2015","true","7.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","1"

Although the voice overs are much to over-used and you may get tired of hearing "3... 2... 1... GO!!" by the end of the game. In short, the graphics and sound are not anything spectacular, even for your average 8-bit indie game. What makes this game special is the gameplay and the wide array of characters which each have their own unique style and abilities.\n\nLove and hate. What some users don't particularly like about this game is that you can't ever choose the character you want to play as, the developers say they made the game randomly select characters for you to keep you on your toes. There are some times I wish I could be Predator or Blade (Wesley Snipes) for a whole level but sadly cannot. Thankfully, the vast array of characters makes up for this and the unlocking system makes you excited for who will be unlocked next.\n\nLife is hard. Even though your hero may br a bad-azz from a movie such as Terminator or The Matrix, you still die in one hit, one bullet is all it takes and you can also die from things falling on top of you, or even debris from explosions. There are also plenty of mini-bosses and bosses in the game to keep the player on their toes.\n\nYou can play up to 4-player local co-op or online. I, personally, played through the game alone and still had a blast. Try this if you are a movie buff or enjoy 2D games with destruction.\n\nThis review was based on the current build as of writing.

SATAN?!). LIBERATE the forests. LIBERATE the jungles. LIBERATE the villages. LIBERATE the cities. LIBERATE the xenomorph hives.\n\nOh, you basically annihilated the level because your massively overpowered BRO GUNS blew up all the terrain? GREAT. You had to destroy the village in order to save it? AWESOME. Let EXPLOSIONS ring like FREEDOM all across the land.\n\nBuy this game because it is fun on steroids and to strike a blow for LIBERTY and AMERICA THE FREE WORLD AMERICA. If you don't, you're clearly a Commie TERRORIST.\n\n***\n\nIn all seriousness, it's a platforming shoot-em-up with destructable everything and chained explosions that can really scratch that arcade itch. It doesn't take itself seriously at all and with levels taking about five minutes if you happen to take your time and try to play smart (rather than just blowing everything up, which can be fun), there's no problem with it being arcade-hard at times since you never lose that much progress. The one absurdly tough boss they had--the infamous massive helicopter--they nerfed, which is kinda sad, because when you beat that thing you felt a real feeling of achievement. The pacing is actually pitch-perfect because while frenetic explosions-a-go-go happen a lot you can often times hang back and decide whether or not you really do want to rush in where angels fear to tread (of course you do).\n\nThis game's only gone from strength to strength in its development. It built some solid platforming fundamentals first--even the Brototype was absurdly fun--and has added new levels, tweaked graphics, actual recognition from the action hero community, different play modes, and a joyously over-the-top announcer type who can scream with you when you inevitably blow yourself up in some insane chain reaction. The developers are engaged with the community--often in ALL CAPS OF AWESOME--and the semi-regular themed level "competitions" are great.\n\nAll this being said, it is unapologetically an arcade game. There is no plot to speak of. The game is not intelligent or particularly witty, nor is it trying to be. You will fail, a lot, and then you will succeed gloriously. If that's not your cuppa, then wave off, though I'd recommend watching a friend play since it certainly is colorful and beautiful in its pixel-art way and can be a treat to watch.\n\nIn very rare circumstances so much can be going on that the game will actually slow down. This somehow fails to be a problem because then it just feels like slow-mo in an action film, so it can't even be called a bug (plus, you'll either survive and it'll speed up or you'll die and the level will reset, so it's hardly a big deal).","March 28, 2015","true","11.6"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","75","6","8","3","0"

All your favorite 80's, 90's, 00's, action stars, unite as a unique "Bro Force"  Contra style, 4 player Co-op, everything goes, gore fest, Great arcade fun!! Recommend for everyone...\n\nEdit: Added my ExpendaBros Review - Since its the same game just an Expendables Stand-alone.\n\nI have loved this game ever since it was released via web browser on their website! This tie-in with Expendables is a no brainer and a well taken step in making this a huge/bigger game!!\n\nThe premise is simple you are a group of mercenaries that work to rescue captives, kill enemies, with explosions and blood everywhere! Its Contra on steroids with 1-4 co-op same screen/keyboard multiplayer, and online. This game screams fun and excitement from the Protagonists characters names each following a hollywood action star of the 70,80,90,00,10's Its an amazingly fun and entertaining game. With many levels in the full version "BroForce"\n\nThis is the much needed? IDK? hollywood endorsement! It fits the game and movie perfectly! It doesnt take itself seriously and rages with bullets, bombs, grenades, and other guns made popular by the films each character is based in.\n\nEx.: Terminator = Brominator, Commando = Bromando, Robocop = Bro-bocop, Rambo = RamBro, Die Hard = Bro Hard\nOther characters (to name a few) - Blade, Walker Texas Ranger, Mr Anderson, Neo (Matrix), MiB, Indiana Brones, etc\n\nGreat concept, Great fun early access game!! many levels, and bosses with updates!! highly recommended!!!!\n\nEdit: They ADDED a LEVEL EDITOR!!!

The only people who don't like this game are the terrorists and my girlfriend. Sure, she gives me love and support, but you know what she doesn't give me? EXPLOSIONS! Broforce: 1, Significant other: 0! It's kinda like The Expendables: The Game, only better than the actual The Expendables: The Game. The mayham makes this game consistantly entertaining, and the randomized characters makes the mayham constant. Not being able to choose the bro you play as does sound a bit strange, but it fits into the gameplay very well. So if you like freedom and want a game more American than apple pie and baseball, this is for you. If you say the trailers and/or gameplay footage and were interested, you will most likely enjoy it. All we need now is a Liam Neeson bro, a Jason Statham bro (Probably from Crank), and a bro of Turbo-Man from Jingle All The Way. Call him Turbro-Man.

Tons of content, dynamic cast of characters who are from films of high octane action, gibs, explosions and destructable terrain. What keeps it fresh is how each death changes your character (you don't pick your character) so you have to learn to adapt to each character's playstyle on the fly. Also there's Aliens, with concentrated acid for blood who mostly come out at night... Mostly...\n\nNegative points?

Tons of content, dynamic cast of characters who are from films of high octane action, gibs, explosions and destructable terrain. What keeps it fresh is how each death changes your character (you don't pick your character) so you have to learn to adapt to each character's playstyle on the fly. Also there's Aliens, with concentrated acid for blood who mostly come out at night... Mostly...\n\nNegative points? There's really only two, and that's the camera can be a bit wonky at times during certain boss fights and that there's some tiny graphical glitches, but all in all it's a pretty fantastic game that I keep coming back for more.

Whaddaya get? Only the slimmest and most utterly masculine game I've ever played in years, naturally! It's super small, super short, extremely to the point, and it's awesome.\n\nIt's called Broforce.\n\nDeveloped by the indie developer Free Lives, Broforce is a deliberate mash-up of all the clichés that were so central to those twenty years of American big-budget filmmaking. There's no story, no setup – you simply are a bro, you have to free other bros and “liberate” an endless succession of tropical vistas in dire need of seeing a pixellated 'Murrican flag fly high in a couple places. The bros that aren't your bros are the bad bros – and you have to kill these. Violently. With lots of bullets and explosives.\n\nSee, playing as an American in the super-serious Band of Brothers series is one thing. Playing as an American in Call of Duty is another. In Broforce, though? I absolutely have to butcher the word, because there's too much ♥♥♥♥ing testosterone onscreen for me to consider writing it as anything other than 'Murrica. ♥♥♥♥, yeah! Gonna liberate all them freedoms and democraticize – dermocr – I'MMA FIRE MY DEMOCRACY RAY ALL OVER DEM JUNGLE COMMIES, HURRKDRKGLRK.\n\n(insert highly-virile, if pre-verbal grunts, along with the sounds of my simian self attempting to copulate with the nearest available orifice, nevermind how impractical or dangerous this may be)\n\nAhem.\n\nIn pure Arcade fashion, the game times you and measures how many vaguely threatening balaclava-wearing enemies you've blown to kingdom come. Combining both of these factors satisfactorily nets you a fairly high score, and that's what you're shooting for. At its purely minimal, though, the game is really about reaching the end-of-level flag, which actually is a hovering helicopter. Grab that, and your last controlled bro takes off, even as all the explosives you haven't detonated in the level go off simultaneously and a killer electric guitar solo plays you out. It's pixellized, there's blood everywhere, the soundtrack feels suitably Eighties Commando Warfare-ish, but the real draw is in how your extra lives are handled.\n\nAcross each level, you'll find tied and gagged prisoners that may or may not be stuck behind bars. Shoot or blow them free, and they'll all reveal themselves to be one of the Bros – basically a uber-simplified parody of your typical Action Flick Leading Man. Blade becomes Brade, John McLane becomes Bro Hard, Chuck Norris' Cordell Walker becomes Brodell Walker, McGuyver is rechristened as MacBrover – you get the idea. There's dozens of little pixelly packs of sheer man-juices for you to unlock, and not all of them control identically. MacBrover has no guns but can pull dynamite sticks out of nowhere. Brambo has his trusty machine gun, and John Matrix' Commando analogue, Brommando, packs his assault rifle and grenades. There's also B.A. Broacus, Bro Dredd, Bro in Black, Snake Broskin, the Brominator, Brobocop and my all-time favorite, Indiana Brones.\n\nHells yeah.","October 21, 2015","true","1.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

Game marketed as chaos incarnate, but as usual in actuality it paced much slower and more tactical, since player have to compensate for different characters' abilities and play-style.\n\nThe satire is nice and choice of focus on heroes instead of actors let the game to have several different roles of the same actor from different IP. Also game uses some recent and some obscure characters, due to which it stands above nostalgia monetization like expendables (and expendabros). Though it would be nice to have some characters of Rothrock (Nikita would be nice too) and asian actors like Lee or Chan. Since they already using british Bond and french Leon and Lambert, they don't seem to be tied to 'murica narrative outside of diegesis.\n\nIt starts very solid due to good level design, but in the middle interactive narrative is so non-generic alien, that it turns into comics-level crossover "rocketeer and Raiden versus aliens". Final chapters pretty generic so it returns to normal state. Though last mission is so long that you tied to a chair for couple of hours since there are no saves inside levels.\n\nIt works totally fine on 4k surround, but letterbox stylization is not wide enough, as usual. Game looks nice, but shaking screen and a lot of chaos on suicide run is somewhat irritating, due to contradiction to optimal playstyle.\n\nOverall the game quite fresh and original and not full of memeseses and dumb nostalgia, references are no more than for flavour. Works fine plays fine and offers some new gameplay mechanics.","January 2","true","13.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I have played now more than 100 hours, most of the time just the campaign on and on again, but also the custom campaign have already many great levels to choose from and also online mode is pretty great.\n\nGraphics: The graphics are awesome. They really fit for the over the top 80ies action vibe that is going on. It's really smooth even with massive explosions.\n\nSound: With the sound it's pretty much the same. You can nearly hear the 80ies in it, with all it's glory. With additions like the Wilhelm scream or Bronans screams, it is just great.\n\nReplayability: The campaign at the moment is mostly done in around 1 hour, but you can play it massively, with different approaches. If you try to rescue any hostage, if you try to rescue none, kill everyone or kill noone, stealth (they shall not see you)... so many different possibilites. And after playing a hundred times, there is still hard mode, online play, custom campaigns or the many other local multiplayer modes.\n\nWithout talking more about this game... I got a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of fun for $15. I got to meat really nice devs that even talk to you and use the ideas of their customers to make the game even better. They still promise many different things for the game (just look at the coming soon picture), so what else could i wish for.

It is everything you hate about Michael Bay movies and Call of Duty Singleplayer Campaigns, except that it is actually good. It is one of the few unfinished games I have played that keeps getting better everytime it gets a new update. It is the Team America videogame that was never made and the Expendables videogame that should have been all at once. Its devs are committed to refining and perfecting each and every explosion effect that exists within the game. It is the most American game that has ever been made by a non-American developer. It is a game where three different players can control three completely different versions of Arnold Schwarzenegger simultaneously. It is a game where challenging, tactical combat and devil-may-care Rambro-style killing sprees can peacefully coexist flawlessly. Its experiences are fun and fullfilling solo, but are magnified endlessly with friends, both online and single-screen. It is the past, the present, and the future of gaming, entertainment, art, and warfare all rolled in to one. And it is the single game that was able to renew my faith in the Steam Early Access program.\n\nHell yes I recommend Broforce.","April 7, 2014","true","26.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Simple and easy, yet addictive and fun at the same time. My biggest complaint with the game is something that is going to be addressed in the future, which is more content. Another minor gripe that I have is the current system for Bro selection (there is none) and the fact when you rescue a prisoner, you automatically change to a new Bro. It's not a game breaker by any means, but some degree of control of which Bro you get to play, either a starting character select, or the ability to just add a life from rescuing a prisoner instead of auto switching to a new Bro.\n\nThere is a nice variety of Bros at this time, each with different basic attacks and special attacks. There is a balance between the special attacks and basic attacks too, making each bro more of an asset in one way or another depending on the situation. I'm least impressed with the MIB-like Bro (Bro In Black). I have yet to find a use for his special attack, and his basic attack is very sporadic in responce.\n\nThe game plays much like Contra in style, especially the multiplayer, in the fact that if one of the players starts going to high or too far ahead of the other, the player that is behind is going to die, so you need to communicate with your partner so the lives you build up aren't squandered by somebody rushing.\n\nIf you enjoy action movies, simple run and gun gameplay, explosions, gibs, and lots of blood, this game is for you.","April 8, 2014","true","5.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Broforce offers us an EXPLOSIVE gameplay, cooperative, full of humour and 8-bit nostalgia. Even in its beta version, it brings us into a world in which our movie heroes, the BROs, are the best in the universe and the only ones who can put and end to terrorism.\n\nI can’t even remember how I got to know Broforce. Around last year’s month of July, in our 4×06 podcast, we talked about it for the first time. This Free Lives’ project had started in 2012 and was already an awesome-to-be game in that time. In other words, an action platformer which spices up both Metal Slug and The Expendables, but with its own unique touches.\n\nEven though being in Beta version (free sample here!), this game shines its own light. Where should I begin this with? Probably the beginning… Let’s say you were born somewhere in between 1980 and 1999, with thousands of movie classics around you together with many 8 & 16 bit shooters that blew your mind as soon as you gave your first gaming steps. Broforce is filled with american heroism, love for your country and invincible super soldiers. Right before our eyes, characters that make us feel that special something just by saying their names: John McClane, Robocop, MacGyver, Terminator, Conan, Rambo, Chuck Norris, Blade, Machete, Neo and many others…\n\nBroforce team is a militar organization -poorly financed- that focuses on defeating terrorism in a place that looks similar to Vietnam, pretty destroyable. The thing about having so many BROs is the RANDOM factor that brings us this epic adventure. Those premises are pretty straightforward; we begin with a certain character (ex. RAMBRO) and as we make our way by mutilating as many enemies as we see (or even part of the scenery, Terraria/Spelunky style), we’ll find cages with prisoners to set free (Metal Slug style). That’s where our Bro unveils another character and we automatically become that new Bro, drenched with serial-killer testosteroness (plus One Up!)\n\nWhat’s the objective? As a classic platformer, we’ll have to go all the way down to the goal in order to assassinate a General (represented as a devil), plant our flag and flee away in a helicopter (inmediately after the scenery implodes). All this with up to four Bros at the same time… Didn’t I tell you? Broforce has a Cooperative mode, both local and online, with the possibility of making a high-five with our mates and activating slow-mo to see our enemies (or allies) exploding reeeeally slow. Each character has not only a regular attack but also a special attack which can be used in key moments (up to three times). This unique moves are obviously inspired by each movie hero. It seems that Free Lives has made an important point in bringing up each Bro’s personality with passion.\n\nGameplay in general can be fast-paced, chaotic and explosive. Nevertheless, you may also want to play cautiously, as just one enemy shot is enough to kill us. Even though there’s no friendly fire, destroying the scenery doesn’t help much: we can die by falling onto nothing or it can make our journey more complicated (fun though!). You can’t aim up nor down, thing which generates many complicated situations. All in all, everything is pretty intuitive, with accurate controls (Keyboard or gamepad) and well balanced.\n\nIn the many levels we could try out in the beta version (more to come), difficulty increases progressively. New enemies showed up, mini Bosses and big bosses. But the best thing about this version was to find more features (not included in the free sample) such as a pretty intuitive level editor. Thanks to the power of the internet those levels can be shared with the community, giving us in return the possibility to play the game over and over again. There’s also a Deatchmatch mode to make some killing in between friends. Another mode that empowers friendship is Race, in which whoever comes first to the finish line wins. There’s also Explosion Run, that invites us to run towards our goal by escaping a series of explosions right behind us. Super fun!\n\nAnd I want to draw particular attention to the level of humour implied: Enemies are not that smart, paroding newbie soldiers that know only how to shoot. Their (over)reactions have very funny details: their yelling and desperation when bursting into flames, when they see a bomb about to explode, when a honeycomb falls down on their heads (yes, there are bees) or when we throw a pig at them (YES, a pig). And many things to be discovered that will make you have a blast for sure.","July 3, 2014","true","6.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Simple and easy, yet addictive and fun at the same time. My biggest complaint with the game is something that is going to be addressed in the future, which is more content. Another minor gripe that I have is the current system for Bro selection (there is none) and the fact when you rescue a prisoner, you automatically change to a new Bro. It's not a game breaker by any means, but some degree of control of which Bro you get to play, either a starting character select, or the ability to just add a life from rescuing a prisoner instead of auto switching to a new Bro.\n\nThere is a nice variety of Bros at this time, each with different basic attacks and special attacks. There is a balance between the special attacks and basic attacks too, making each bro more of an asset in one way or another depending on the situation. I'm least impressed with the MIB-like Bro (Bro In Black). I have yet to find a use for his special attack, and his basic attack is very sporadic in responce.\n\nThe game plays much like Contra in style, especially the multiplayer, in the fact that if one of the players starts going to high or too far ahead of the other, the player that is behind is going to die, so you need to communicate with your partner so the lives you build up aren't squandered by somebody rushing.\n\nIf you enjoy action movies, simple run and gun gameplay, explosions, gibs, and lots of blood, this game is for you.","April 8, 2014","true","5.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The single player is great, but the game really shines in multiplayer. It's not a game you will probably spend untold hours into the thick of the night playing to get every last discovery, but a game you can come back to repeatedly, frequently, for an awesome taste of brotastic action, especially with a bro. The controls are responsive with plenty of versatility in movement and decent attacking options (character-specific basic and special power).\n\nA lot more can be said about this game but should be experienced first-hand. For instance, if I said that one's ability to appreciate a seemingly endless chain of action movie hero references would increase one's enjoyment even more, would that tip the scales? Probably not by itself, but coupled with a solid game and humorous pixel artwork, it certainly adds to the feel of bro'ing out with some power bros and kicking badguy a$$.\n\nWith gameplay inspired by classics such as Commando, Contra and Metal Slug, mixed with modern physics effects, and a great variety of extra game modes, multiplayer and other content, Broforce actually delivers.","April 9, 2014","true","16.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You will die.\n3b. A lot.\n3c. Henceforth, if you get a character you like, you will swiftly be replaced with one you don't.\n\nI like this game. A lot. However the entire concept of this game revolves around running and gunning, killing everything, but when you die with one hit it feels like I'm being punished for playing the game the way I'm supposed too. One minute I'm on a killing streak as Rambro, only to be hit by an exploding canister that fell on me from off screen. Now I am Brochete, who is still awesome, but not who I wanted to play as. Now I have to save a hostage, and instead of being Brobo Cop, the character I was lucky to get at the start of the missiob, I am someone completely different, who I don't like.\n\nThe entire playthrough of this game I enjoyed MOST of it. When I was going on a crazy rampage as the character I wanted, I was extremely happy. When I spawned as my favorite character, only to save one hostage and be replaced with my least favorite? Not as much.\n\nTake all this as you will. It's an AMAZING game, full of great moments, and crazy ammounts of gung-ho action, and you will get your money's worth (and more considering it's still being updated), but it has a few small drawbacks.\n\nAll in all, recommend!\n","July 10, 2014","true","5.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/indieluchador/recommended/274190/","indieluchador","Indie Luchador","http://steamcommunity.com/id/indieluchador/","398 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nSteam's Early Access program is an interesting thing for all gamers that use the platform.  Some of the games that the program sees are basic tech demos, while other games are seemingly half-baked products that leave consumers wondering  why they parted ways with their hard-earned cash. It turns out that it usually seems like the latter of the two given options.\n\nFortunately, this is not the case with Broforce from Free Lives. Free Lives has just released Broforce upon the world this past Monday via Steam, and it is a whole hell of a lot of fun.\n\nLet's talk about what Broforce is, though. Broforce is a side-scrolling shooter that lets players take control of some of the best action stars of all time to take down America-hating terrorists with all of the freedom-wielding bullets that one can handle. Oh... EXPLOSIONS! Did I mention the abundance of explosions?! If something on the screen isn't exploding, the player is doing something wrong.\n\nEvery bullet fired or explosion triggered can vastly change the landscape. Enemies will go down fast, leaving piles of corpses, or the platforms that the action stars tread upon will break apart and leave the player to create their own new way to the final part of the level. This means that you shouldn't have to freak out like a "girly man" when you have destroyed your given pathway. Instead, use those Americanized bullets to rip holes through to the next area.\n\nWhy is Broforce worth purchasing on Steam Early Access, you ask? Well, while Broforce currently has developer-created content that stretches out to about an hour of gameplay, the community has the ability to craft some magnificent levels that sometimes rival the developers' levels. The ability to rate community levels also adds an amount of feedback so that one may know if it is worth touching that level.\n\nBroforce feels like a dream to play, but it's not finished yet. This means that the game can only go up from here. So what is there that should deter people from buying this already amazing product?  I can't honestly give a reason to not buy it in the state that it is in. Free Lives is promising monthly updates until the final release of Broforce. This means more "bros" are still to come, and each will still have different combat types. Also, expect developer-created levels featuring the "xenomorphs" from the Aliens franchise. After all, the screenshot is amazing!\n\nAs someone that has always loved games in the vein of Contra, Broforce scratches that itch that is rarely touched upon. In its current state, Broforce is worth every penny of the $14.99. Knowing that there is way more to come means that Broforce can only add more value to the game as time passes.\n\nSo, what is the verdict based upon what is there right now? Buy this bullet-riddled, balls-to-the-wall, action-driven, laughter-inducing game.","April 16, 2014","true","123.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I have played extensively in the single player (including speed running), locally with my girlfriend (37 hours according to her steam account) and a bit on the PS4 version as well.\n\nGameplay:\nSide scrolling platforming and shooting (also melee). Levels are entirely destructible, which can lead to many changes in gameplay, from chaotic explosions with three friends trying to jump across man-made chasms to sneaking under the level to avoid enemies. There is a wall climb mechanic that allows some freedom without the need for destruction. Or to get you out of a hole you created.\n\nEach bro has a different combat style and special ability, and bro's switch whenever you get a 'free life' (essentially a 1-UP). Slightly RNG, but every bro can finish every level.\n\nStory:\nSatirical of war and America's invasions of countries (don't worry, it's more tongue in cheek than political). A lot of good references throughout.\n\nGraphics and Sound design:\nPretty amazing. The pixel art is surprisingly expressive, and allows the game to maintain a consistant frame rate, even with a crazy amount of explosions and particle effects being rendered on screen.\n\nThe sound design was good, but with Joonas Turner joining the project turned things up to 11. Music is motivational without being overwhelming, enemies make genuinely funny sounds, and explosions boom.\n\nThis game has very strong audio-visual feedback.\n\nThe campaign has enough content to last at least a few hours (amazing replay value), huge amount of community created content, and several developer created bonus maps. All of the developer created content is of impeccable quality, and the community content is pretty good and is curated on a 5 star rating system.\n\nMost of the content can be played either solo, online/local multiplayer, with plans to bring online multiplayer to the other game modes.\n\nThere is a robust level editor to create custom levels.\n\nStability:\nThe game is very stable, I have never had it crash since it released into early access release.\n\nBroforce is an amazing game that I am very happy to have supported and am very happy with the  finished product. Here's hoping for an expansion!","August 23, 2014","true","18.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

So, in response to this, the heroic Americans, who are the supreme defender of the master ideology, capitalism, have deployed America's greatest defenders of freedom: Chuck Norris, The Terminator, Conan the Barbarian, Rambo, and Robocop to name a few... So yeah, thats basically the story, I tear up a little everytime I play this game, its... its just so emotion packed... You should totally play it, only a COMMUNIST wouldn't play this amazing game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Killah_Zillah/recommended/274190/","Killah_Zillah","Killah Zillah","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Killah_Zillah/","39 products in account","The Rating System: Good refers to the obvious positive qualities, the Bad is reserved for nitpicks and gripes that don't necessarily ruin the experience, the Ugly is for the worst parts of the game, meant for serious consideration before purchase.\n\n\nThe Good:\n\nBroforce is a game, like Hotline Miami, that banks on its cool factor to draw you in. You play as recognizable pop culture icons, each having wildly varying abilities, such as the Terminator, John Rambo, and Neo from The Matrix. If crossovers are something you like, this game has it in spades, with numerous references everywhere. You can tell the developers had a blast making the game, and love their chosen subject matter just as much as their audience. A game BY action movie fans, FOR action movie fans. Gameplay is built around very simple to understand, intuitive mechanics: You've got a basic attack, a special ability and a punch button. You start with a random character, your only goal is to reach the end and kill a non-threatening demon or tough boss, and terrain can be broken by shooting or punching it. However, the true meat of this experience comes from how unpredictable the game is. Sometimes you're forced to tunnel under the enemy for a surprise attack. Sometimes you have to shape the terrain into a set of stairs or platforms to pass an area because an explosion happened that you weren't expecting. The biggest element of randomness comes from the characters themselves. You spawn with a randomly selected character, and since you never know who you're going to get, you're constantly forced to radically alter playstyle and re-evaluate the level on a moment to moment basis every time you die. You may be given a character with a massively powerful weapon that knocks you back when you use it, you might be given a super fast character that's tricky to control, you might be given one with no ranged attack at all and relies entirely on traps, melee or grenade throws. Despite how that sounds, it's challenging, but never overwhelming and certainly never complicated. This mechanic makes the game stay fresh even when you've beaten it time and time again, as no two playthroughs are exactly the same.\n\nBroForce is random by design, intending to give you the most gut busting "what the crap was that?!" moments it can, and the mere fact that you're playing as action movie stars in such a cartoonishly over the top world with such easily accessable pick-up-and-play simplicity make it a hilarious burst of fun for an hour or two.\n\n\nThe Bad\n\nThe screen is zoomed out just a little too much, making it difficult to tell who's who when you're playing with a friend. There's a couple of characters that have flaws that make certain parts of the game unfinishable until you can get a different one. For example, Highlander is extremely slow, which means that if you're stuck with him on a part that requires you to move quickly - such as if an unkillable boss monster is chasing you - then you must simply die and hope for a faster character to be chosen when you respawn. The game has plenty of levels, the level design is fine, but the game itself has long strings of levels where there are few completely new enemies or hazards to play with, and because of the inherant simplicity, that can make the game boring for some people. While it doesn't bother this author in the slightest, the constant overuse of the phrase "bro", may irritate some players after a while, and its constant ridiculousness could wear you out. It really isn't a game that's meant to be played for very long.\n\n\nThe Ugly:\n\nThe bugs are its biggest downfall. On the final boss in particular, I had actually succeeded against him several times, but for whatever reason the.. for the purpose of avoiding spoilers, "cutscene" wouldn't happen, making the camera freeze until I paused and restarted the entire level over. On semi-rare occasions, the level wouldn't load properly and entire sections of the map would be missing, making it unplayable until I closed the program and restarted it. Another major failing is a lack of tutorial. If you aren't familiar with the characters you're playing as, then their abilities will likely be completely foreign to you, and you'll be wondering what the hell you're supposed to be doing with them or why they're behaving so differently. Take Leon the Professional for example. His punch button isn't a punch at all. It teleports you in any direction, even through single block walls, and he's the only character who's like that. His special ability is to mark enemies for an off screen sniper to kill, the only one that does that too. I've never seen the movie this character is from, and as such, was left very frustrated at first when I lept down to try and punch an enemy only to appear down below the floor and into a bottomless pit, or tried to use their special ability infront of a super enemy and end up getting killed as the sniper wasn't able to finish them off fast enough. You can easily adapt and learn each character's abilities, but as I said, this could be easily remedied with a light tutorial when introducing the character.\n\nFinally, it all boils down to this: Its greatest strength, its ease of play and simplicity, can also be its biggest failing for certain people. This is an arcade game at its heart, if you're looking for a fulfilling experience that'll allow you to dump hours upon hours into it (ex: Fallout), or some in-depth strategic gameplay (ex: Team Fortress 2), you should know that this may not be your game. If you just want to blow up some bad guys using satisfying methods that're almost entirely up to your own imagination, laughing at the constant movie references while high fiving your friends, then give it a try.\n\n\nFinal Verdict: 7/10\n\nThe occasional bugs are often enough to take a couple points off and the flaws in some of the characters bring it down an additional point, but were these issues patched and balanced out in future updates, I'd have nothing at all against the game. As my Mark of the Ninja review implies, I love games that offer you a simple goal, gives you the tools you need and leaves how you complete that goal almost entirely up to you. That's a big part of why I like this game so much, but it's the ridiculous dialed-up-to-eleven charm and hilarious unpredictability that make the game well worth the already cheap price in my opinion.\n\nI also adore its theme song.  \m/-","February 18","true","38.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

I have 2 complaints however.\n\n\n1. The price is too much. I would stop the price at 10 dollars, but it costs 15 dollars. I get that it's being funded for development, but I still found it to be a lot of money for what you get.\n\n2. The campaign is too short. I played with my friend for about 2 hours before they had to stop, and later that week I pressed 'continue campaign', and the campaign was apparently already completed when I played it with my friend, and the final level was just an animated cutscene.","October 24, 2015","true","3.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

You play as a "Bro", who is named and shaped after a popular character from a movie or TV series. You have everyone from Neo (Matrix), to a great parady of Macgyver. So far the game has limited capability, although the Campaign is satisfying. It starts off easy, then slowly builds up to a near impossible boss at the end. I have finished it in about 10hrs, so I would like it if there were a few more levels to complete. Because you can destroy everything in this game, it allows you to really be creative in the way you progress. For example, you could shoot a block above someone and watch it fall on their head. Or you could try to run the map without killing anyone or shooting a single bullet - it is possible.\nI love the fact that you can create your own worlds and levels, but I don't really use it. One thing that they could improve could be to choose what bro you want to play as, as sometimes it does get a bit boring playing one character all the time.\n\nAll in all, Broforce is a great little game that will keep you entertained for a long time, although maybe it is worth to wait a bit for the full game.\n4.3/5\n","November 21, 2014","true","18.3"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

The levels are a lot of fun with destructable environments and explosives laying everywhere. No one bro plays the same as another, which helps keep things feeling fresh. If the creators add Kenny Powers to this game it will be as American as carpet bombing a terrorist training camp. Absolutely recomend it as is, but Kenny Powers would make this perfection.","July 4, 2014","true","10.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You'll have to select custom maps from the in-game menus.\n\nBros:\n- Online coop with strangers or friends.\n- Level-Editor which allows you create the most craziest of levels.\n- Lots of good maps from the community can be found online.\n\nBest idea: Check out Expendabros to get a good idea on how the single player campaign's levels look like. If you think Expendabros was fun and now you're done with it do NOT buy the game. If you liked Expendabros and can't wait to make your own maps, play coop online or blow up even more levels: go buy it now and support this awesome indie title.","August 8, 2014","true","12.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Phenomenal.\n\nI would highly recommend this game as a side scroller more than I would recommend the award winning masterpiece Fez, just due to the destructiveness and hidden easter eggs in the game.\n\nCritics rating: 7.8/10","April 8, 2014","true","10.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
