"http://steamcommunity.com/id/HeavyWeaponsBaby/recommended/435460/","HeavyWeaponsBaby","Diana Night","http://steamcommunity.com/id/HeavyWeaponsBaby/","209 products in account","Product received for free\n\n(This review spoils small certain things)\n(Which the game spoils itself at its disclaimer when it starts)\n\n\nI wish Steam had a "Draw" or something option when it comes to rating certain games.\n\nI sadly did not enjoy the game since its humour did not get a kick out of me. And if you won't find this game funny, unfortunately there is nothing much else in here, its humour is the main selling feature, and unfortunately I did not find the style of humour that is used here funny.\n\nLet it be known that not at one point I was offended or any of the sort, my feelings were never hurt, the game just simply didn't make me laugh and annoyed me sadly more than anything else, I never found the "every sound effect even soundtrack is made by mouth" thing. It gets annoying quite quickly, at least to me. Enemies repeat a lot of the same lines and over and over again when you kill them, and some have the same death lines every time they die, if they come in groups this can become particularly annoying (Especially the ghosts).\n\nI also encountered some technical issues, at the "park" level, after the world war level that is. The mini-games crashed my game after they ended (Mini-game where you shoot kids for example) so I started avoiding these since they crashed my game and forced me to start a level from the beginning.\n\n\nSo, what kind of humour is the game going for? I hear it is a parody of Call of Duty, that is its intention. Yet the way it's done does not seem to be such, there are some ♥♥♥♥-takes at how Call of Duty potrays certain situations and comments there and there, but some of the jokes are almost completely unrelated to the game it claims to parody. Most of the jokes don't really play off Call of Duty and seem to rely more on being as random as possible and throwing the player into random goofy situations, sadlly soon the player can start epxecting what will come next.\n\nThe game is very loud and constantly spams player with various voice lines, from enemies to various characters in the game, there isn't much moment of silence, if any, which eventually makes the experience tiring\n\nThe charm of the humour to me weared off around the time the tutorial ended. Like most parodies it's hit and miss, sadly to me it was mostly a miss, as the game spams the player with a lot of noise and silly voices, one could get a PTSD flashback to the "Scary Movies" (It never gets THAT bad) which get annoying quickly and stop being funny. Some gags go on for too long yet never go quite anywhere, for example there is a comrade on your squad that is introduced in the beginning that is needed in the team because he opens doors, this is obviously a reference to the COD's scripted sequences where AI would constantly open the door for the player rather than player himself, yet it never goes quite anywhere and the gag never develops into anything. It just suddenly vanishes without giving a proper punch.\n(I could be wrong, maybe the gag will return with its punch like at the end or something?)\n\n\nThe gameplay sadly is even worse, there are some interesting ideas there and there, but tehre are parts that are quite lazy, like when you were told to destroy "Salties" which essentially are huge "salt" vehicles shooting rockets at you, you are given a rocket launcher and are told to, well, obviously kill them. This part of the game goes on for far too long to the point it stops being fun and you wish to move on to something else, the enemies that are presented here are not even slightly fun to battle. It doesn't help that the trails of smoke behind the rockets obsecure the rockets themselves pretty well, and you have to dodge these rockets, which can be pretty annoying since the before mentioned smoke makes them very hard to see.\n\nWhat's even worse is that after you die, the smoke these rockets left behind them don't dissapear, this means that the screen is covered in even more and more smoke from these rockets and it becomes a huge cluster ♥♥♥♥. This is another example of the game having certain technical issues, another one comes to mind with snipping nuns, where the player is tasked to kill them, sometimes they would dissapear out of the windows and re-appear, I am not sure if this was intentional, if this meant they are "hiding" or if this is some kind of error, I honestly could not tell.\n\nThe weapons are unsatisfying and not fun to use, you might argue that I am going towards the gameplay too much and excuse it as a "parody" I do not believe that you can excuse flaws in a game play just because it is a parody.\n\nParody should not excuse poor quality of anything. And the gun play here is anything but fun, it's slow, some weapons are almost worthl-ess, the weapons the nuns drop are essentially one hit kill, I believe. The problem is that the projectile is slow, VERY slow. Taking forever to reach its target, I am not sure if that is the joke.\n\n\nSo should you get this game? Well, watch the trailers, watch some gameplay videos, if the humour seems appealing to you, I guess go for it. I am not sure even a person wh o would genuinelly like the humour wouldn't get tired of it after a while as the game goes along.\n\n\nNevertheless, I wish the developers who made this game a good luck in their next projects, as this is a big improvement from NotGTAV. Even if I don't find it funny, I find it quite charming. And in the end.\n\n\nTL:DR: You have to find the humour here funny to like the game as the gameplay cannot hold it alone, sound design is annoying, there are some technical issues which will probably be fixed as time goes on..","May 25","false","0.9"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","12","17","0","5"

Your enjoyment of the game purely relies on how much you find its premise funny.\n\nSTORYSet in Britain, you play as Private Suds Sudzington Jr and you find yourself dropped ♥♥♥♥-firstwards into this Hell. You will murder WWII reenactors, priests, nuns, children, and even animals.\nThe script is very funny, and most jokes hit right home, making fun of not only CoD, but also other games, religion, and much more without feeling disrespectful, which is something really hard to achieve.\n\nGRAPHICSThe hand-drawn graphics are quite ugly at first, but the more you play the more you get used to them, and they are quite charming in the end. But still, they are not all that good (even though it is part of the joke).\n\nGAMEPLAYThe game smartly uses a 2D perspective, with really smooth controls for both k/m and gamepad. You can carry two weapons at a time, 4 frag grenades, and 4 smoke grenades. A good achievment of the developers was making this a constantly enjoyable game that has good variety: gunfights, turret sections, on-rail sequences, and even puzzle keep changing the pace of your playthrough. There are many different weapons and enemies to fight, each requiring a different strategy to dispatch them as efficiently as possible.\nI enjoyed playing through the game, and it felt pretty good. I can't deny, however, that in the long run it got a bit tiring, even with the different gameplay sequences.\n\nCHALLENGEYou have a health bar, and you need to find medikits to regain health. Gunfights are mostly doable, but some sequences tend to get really hard, delivering some decent challenge.\n\nSOUNDThe british voice acting is a joy to listen to, and the soundtrack is darn fun to listen to. Props to the composer!\n\nREPLAYABILITYMultiple episodes will be released in the future, and when you finish the game you can play it again to find more secrets, or you can play a Zombie mode with a friend in split-screen coop. And don't forget the 73 achievements to unlock!\n\nOverall, this is a funny and competent shooter that delivers good jokes and decent variety. Easily one of the best satire games available right now. Highly recommended on sale, and on full price for lovers of parodies.\n\nStory: 7.5\nGraphics: 6\nGameplay: 7\nChallenge: 6.5\nSound: 7\nReplayability: 7\n\nENJOYMENT: 7\nFRUSTRATION: 3\nFollow me on Twitter: @nickygra97\nSubscribe to my channel\nLike on Facebook\nJoin my Steam group","May 23","true","6.1"," 12 of 20 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","12","20","0","0"

Given that the United States is Steam's largest demographic, this would explain why this game is getting such mixed reception. I, on the other hand, come from down under. I'm from Australia, mate.\n\nThe gameplay, while in no way innovative, is, as the trailer puts it, "a proper game" this time. So if you liked NotGTAV but wished it wasn't a Snake clone, you'll love NotCoD.\n\nThe graphics and sound... well, for the most part they're part of the humour, so if you don't find the game funny, the art within it is not going to redeem it for you. I will note, however, that this game has a kickass title screen theme.\n\nSo, should you buy this game? Not if you're one of those heretics who... ahem... not if you don't like Monty Python. Otherwise, go for it, this game is great.","May 28","true","8.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"
