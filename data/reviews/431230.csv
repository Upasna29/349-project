As it stands it's a mobile port (which I knew) but a badly polished one (which I didn't know).\n\nIt's a tower defense game game without the towers.  A hero defense game unlike Defense of the Ancients.  When under attack by a wave the hero loses the ability to move, becoming a 'hero tower', but gains the ability to summon defenders who can be moved within a limited range.\n\nNone of the above is bad and along with the heavilly Kingdom Rush inspired graphics Tiny Guardians has happy cute feel to it.\n\nThe probelm is in the port / implementation.  Everything is slide this, tap that.  If you want to summon a unit there is no right click wheel that can be popped up where you want the unit.  Instead click and drag the summoned units card to where you want them.  It's possible to click a card and then click where you want to summon the defender but this doesn't always work.  Not a show stopper but subtly annoying.\n\nUpgrading units is the same.  There is no context wheel for a unit, instead there is an upgrade card that must be dragged, not dragged anywhere in particular, just dragged.  Then the unit upgrades.   Moving too: click a unit and then drag the unit to where you want them, not select and click where you want them because again, the command is mostly ignored but not always.  All of this could have been better and with all little annoyances I started losing interest.\n\nThe game is slow, both in terms of unit movement and play style.  I found my mind wandering whilst waiting for my units to mop up various groups of baddies.  Playing the game on harder modes doesn't really help as increasing the difficulty increases enemy health but doesn't allow for more skilful play.\n\nIt's not possible to select a unit behind another unit - including the hero.  This would have been a problem only if there was more than minimal control over summoned units.  When moving a unit out of harms way or into a healing circle they'll either not move at all or walk right back to where they were originally.  And this is assuming the screen doesn't inadvertently scroll whilst trying to drag a unit around.\n\nOn the other hand there is so little need for interaction (except during the tedious slogs that are boss fights) that not being able to micro manage units is not a real problem.\n\nLastly and most annoyingly Tiny Guardians has a number of techincal issues.  Sound and music don't work (at least not for me).  The maximum resolution is 1920x1200, lower than my monitors resolution.  Menus are unresponsive and toggle states get confused.  And enemies become passive and invulnerable effectively requiring a stage restart.\n\nI can't recommend Tiny Guardians without an overhaul, I suspect this is a great time waster on mobile devices but it's failed to transistion to PCs.  Buy this is you like Kingdom Rush style art or want to support the developer but otherwise avoid.","March 25","false","3.5"," 22 of 28 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","22","28","0","0"

Its unique take on tower defense is fully realized on better resolutions, and standard PC mouse controls. Both charming and challenging. With this game's constantly moving defense mechanic as its main draw. Place units, as mana permits, around your heroine as she adventures through treacherous lands. Each class and unit has its nuances. Warrior types are better equipped to handle large groups of enemies, while ranged units rain down far greater damages on enemies.\n\nYou will need to shift units to keep weaker units out of danger, and melee units forming a wall from all angles. This balancing of unit positions, unit upgrades, and deploying the more expensive (but more powerful) units is fantastic to play around with. Tiny Guardians exhibits a cute and vivid art and musical style that befits the more amiable style throughout. Easy to understand, a little more difficult to fullly master -- especially on Hard mode. Tower defense fans should be eager to check out this good and innovative game.\n\nPROs- Shifting defense gameplay mechanic is ingenious, and highly enjoyable\n- Cute and vivid aesthetic\n- Simple control schemes\n- Plenty of challenges, and replayability\n\nCONs- Some minor mobile carryover schemes that could have been done better\n- A little too easy at times, especially TD veterans, however hard mode is quite challenging.","March 24","true","6.4"," 27 of 39 people (69%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","69","27","39","6","0"

Not to mention slow.\n\nAdditionally the 'challenge' mode doesnt actually add any level of difficulty as the only actual way to do these missions is to over level past them and unlock the spamable heals and damaging spells.\n\nNot a good game, maybe worth £1.99 on mobile, no way its worth £7 on PC.

The only problem that I see with it is that the story is a short one. It's clear from the gameplay that it's a mobile-port, where you have to click and drag cards to summon your tiny guardians (so that's where the title comes from! lol jkjk ) to defend the summoner, little Lunalie.\n\nYou can breeze through the story with easy-mode, but it's all up to you if you want to go easy, normal, or hard! I've found myself entertained by each level and sometimes aggravated due to small mistakes here and there that end up giving me a game over. But I find that learning from those mistakes adds to the fun of games such as these.\n\nSo will you help little Lunalie's quest to find her friend? Or will you leave the poor little girl by her lonesome?","April 18","true","20.4"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

You can unlock a total of 12 different characters and there are 3 difficulties to choose from to fit any skill level. Once you're done with the storyline, endless mode becomes available. At 10 hours of playtime I've finished the story but am still missing some stars and challenges.\n\nMy only complaint would be it felt a little short overall but I still feel like I got my money's worth.  If you're still unsure just wait for a sale.","April 2","true","12.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wolfycheeks/recommended/431230/","wolfycheeks","Wolf","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wolfycheeks/","348 products in account","I reccomend this game, it´s actually one of my favourite games now! I disagree with the reviews saying the challenge mode doesn´t add any challenge or anything else, I keep failing a challenge on easy, and had to set the difficulty for normal missions on easy too, and normally i´m a pretty well rounded gamer, plus known with tower defence games. This is not an easy game though, and I also don´t think it´s boring. If you play on easy, well yes, it is easy, unless you want to go for 3 stars on each level, which might be a bit more tricky. But when you play on hard, expect to rage. You constantly move units around, especially ranged units, and you really have to watch what you´re doing and where you´re placing units if you´re planning on getting 3 stars, or not dying. Some people seem to have issues with the fact that this is a mobile port, but I think it´s a very well polished mobile port. The controls are good and the sliding is not hard to do at all.. I mean really, just drag your mouse to spawn new units, is that so hard!? Everything is done very nicely. And then the art style and music, which makes it all very cute and nice to look at.\n\nTL;DR:\nCute casual tower defence game, can be easy or hard, a lot of fun to play! 10/10!","March 27","true","6.0"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

Simply a bit more customization and player impact.

As you progress through the levels, you will unlock several new classes/characters to aid you in your journey.\nIt does lack content and feels VERY simple, apart from occasionally having some micro-management of your units, dodging some skillshots from some bosses, and landing your AoE Heals.\n\nIt is a casual, fun little game so don't expect too much from it.\n7/10","March 24","true","2.3"," 4 of 12 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","4","12","0","0"
