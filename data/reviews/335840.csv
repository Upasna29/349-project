If you like the runner genre,  where you have to get from A to B  avoiding various obstacles, and picking up various objects that can be crafted into  wearable equipment such as helments  to customise your two characters,  you'll probably like this.  The game is still in early access, so hopefully we will see  additional content added over the coming months, altohugh I reckon the dev's have already given us quite  alot to be going on with.  Apart from the main story mode   there's a dash mode   which has to be unlocked by playing the story mode; the dash mode is procedurally generated  which means  no two attempts will be the same.\n\nThis is definitely a game where you need to use a  controller  because you have to  control both goats (Chubb and Tempo) at the same time.  It is possible with the  keyboard if you are very adept, but  I found it  almost impossible   with the current key bindings for both  goats.  I do hope the dev's  include the ability to change the key bindings in future updates before this game is fully released as I prefer  using the keyboard to contoller.  That said, i still enjoyed playing this game  and will be keeping an eye on its further development. For an earel;y access game, this is very playable.","February 8, 2015","true","2.8"," 18 of 23 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","18","23","0","0"

As other reviews have already stated, it's a small test in frustration, in a lesser "Super Meat Boy" kind of way. The game is very fair in how it plays, and there is nothing wrong with the controls, however when you control two characters (Goats!) at once you realize your brain is not agreeing with your fingers.\n\nIt's a cute game with achievements, trading cards, it tests your hand/eye coordination, it's cheap to purchase and tells a story of life, loss, redemption, greed, gluttony and grass.\n\n*Please note that many, many, many goats were hurt in the making of this review.

I am so happy for the team (My friend and her team, from Singapore, develop this -- "Goats On A Bridge" as their FIRST game) who had their dream came true and won the IndieGame Competition with a Judge Award, and then released this game on Steam for PC and Mobile Platforms (iOS and Android).\n\nIt needs some "skills" and get yourself to get used to the controls on 2 goats with your both hands.

You control two baaaaaaad goats on a quest to rescue their lost brother. Through each level you have to hoof it, steering two goats over their own paths using one controller without butting into any obstacles or falling into water. Things get a lot harder once you get to level 7 but if you see-saw between the two goats for a few seconds at a time it's very do-able (or should I say doe-able?). Nevertheless you may find this game a bit easier with a friend or some kids (whatever floats your goat) as long as you can stand all the bleating over sharing a controller!","July 15, 2015","true","1.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","4","4","2","1"

Don't let this game deceive you. At first you see cute little goats and have a peaceful flute for menu music, but once you boot up this game cause punishment on levels that reminded me of dark souls. The only thing that will kill you here is yourself. Controls are perfectly responsive, but the capability of controlling two characters while going through a platform course will give a satisfying challenge. The game has seamless controller support which is great. I'm using a DS3 with the SCP drivers and it worked perfect.\n\nNearly 40 poor goats have died and I'm still only on level 5. The game has fun music some tracks reminded me of sonic for some reason. Tons of collectable and fun side stuff like trading cards.\n\nThis is a very fun little polished game.

The button they told me to use was suppose to be the jump button but instead it was the duck button). I figured it out eventually but god I was so mad!\n\nYou're controlling 2 different goats at one time and you can not pass a level without getting both goats over the bridge. Very mind boggling if you try to move both at the same time! (Especially with a game controller!!)\n\nI also think that the times to get 3 stars or even 2 stars is almost impossible especially when you aren't use to controlling 2 characters at one time. You're going to need a loooooot of practice before even thinking of getting 3 stars. If you're a pro at multitasking, you might get 2 stars. Maybe.\n\nOverall, this game is very challenging but that's not a negative. That's actually a pretty good thing because you'll never get bored. You may rage a bit and probably quit but this game is pretty fun when there's so much to do.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/biendeo/recommended/335840/","biendeo","Biendeo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/biendeo/","835 products in account","Long story short: It's Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons but in a shortened and less developed Unity form. It's a half-hour gauntlet of awkward controls, occasionally obnoxious camera movement, and quite repetitive level design, but the presentation makes up for it with adorable visuals and catchy music. Those who are into programming with Unity may enjoy this, although it might be worth trying at a discounted price for anyone else.\nGoats On A Bridge is an adorable game where you play as two goats simultaneously crossing several bridges. The bridges have obstacles that each goat can jump or slide underneath, and both must progress quite evenly through the level. And that's about it. The game lasts for about a half-hour, and offers very few reasons to keep going back to it. That being said, the game feels like it's the developer's first full title, and I want to commend them on what they've done.\n\nIn terms of presentation, this game is quite top-notch. The cel-shaded visual on the goats is very nicely done, and the environments have a Dreamcast-y sort of vibe to them. The levels do feature some copy-pasted platforms though, and it can appear to get repetitive quickly. Surprisingly, the last of the ten levels features a different visual theme, which goes unused anywhere else in the game. The music is also very nice with some catchy melodies, and I'd recommend the soundtrack if you enjoyed the music too.\n\nI recommend that anyone using the Unity engine to make their own games check this game out mainly because it suffers from a lot of underdeveloped or hastily put together elements. The actual game design is okay: the two goats crossing the bridge at the same time is a nice idea, and would allow for including certain puzzles involving the two goats working together. However, the game boils down to moving, jumping, and rolling. The two goats do not interact through gameplay at all. The worst part is that some levels involve one goat's bridge crossing over another goat's bridge. Attempting to have both goats on the same bridge causes one to phase through the floor and die.\n\nAnother issue is the actual control itself. The goats build up momentum the longer you move in a direction, but they stop instantaneously when you let go. This makes the goats feel sluggish at times. There were a couple of points, particularly in the final level, where the goats had very little room to build up momentum to jump over a spike trap. The controls would've felt a little bit better if the goats built up to max speed much quicker, and had a little bit of momentum when stopping.\n\nThe camera gets in the way at times as well. Generally the goats stay about 15% from the bottom of the screen, but if one moves forward a bit, it pushes the other one down almost off the screen, and then it stays there while the other goat moves into the distance. While conceptually, the game doesn't want you to separate the goats, some of the levels, particularly level 9, require one goat to move quite far away from the other goat in order to proceed. There's also times where a goat climbs a tall staircase, and needs to come down, while the other goat is at a low level, which moves the camera to an awkward position where one goat is obstructing the view of his path.\n\nAnd then there's also a few little parts that seemed to be problems in programming. I used a controller to play this game, and I noticed that the main title menu allows you to select each menu item with the analog stick like any other game, but every other menu emulates a mouse with the stick, requiring you to manually point at the level you want. On top of that, the capsule-shaped collider component to the goats doesn't work too well, as there were times when I was standing too close to a ledge, and was unable to jump up, as the collider had jammed itself underneath a platform (but you couldn't move underneath the platform).\n\nAnd there were a couple of minor glitches too. I had a moment where I tried to jump over a spike trap, only to tap it during the upward part of my jump. The goat leapt from the air dead, and then landed on the spike trap again, counting it as two deaths (and caused the game to glitch out a little bit).\n\nI think the worst part about the game is that there's only ten levels in it, which means you can beat it very quickly. Each level has two collectibles, and has a three-star rating system for how quickly you did the levels. However, these do not add towards anything, as there doesn't seem to be any obvious reward for collecting them. The game also allows you to pick up coins, which you can use in a shop to buy cosmetics for the goats. It does add to the cute theme of the game, but again, no practical reason to do it. Finally, after the ten levels, there's an endless runner mode, which doesn't really offer anything other than a few achievements associated with it. The game's mechanics are very basic, and the novelty of playing this mode wears off incredibly quickly.\n\nI don't want to down-vote this game too much, mainly because the $5 admission price is very low, and especially because the game is not rubbish like other Unity titles on Steam. It just suffers from a lack of content and ideas, as well as some poor execution at times. I recommend this game to Unity developers mainly because it's interesting to look at terms of how the design could be better implemented. To everyone else, this game probably deserves a pass, although it might be worth checking out if it goes on sale. I'd recommend Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons if you're looking for something similar in gameplay.\n\nRATING: 1 UP, 2 DOWNMy up/down rating system tries to differentiate between games that are mediocre (less ups and downs total), and games that are interesting but flawed (more ups and downs totals). Ups relate to how much good a game has, and downs are how much bad a game has.\n\n[/table]            0 UPs        1 UPs        2 UPs        3 UPs                Not worth playing, skip it        Alright, play it if you're into the genre        Very good, play it if you're looking for something worth trying        One to go down in history, a must have for everyone[/table]            0 DOWNs        1 DOWNs        2 DOWNs        3 DOWNs                Nothing detrimental in the game        A few things wrong, but doesn't ruin it        Kind-of broken or aggravating, you may not be able to put up with it        Very, very broken, a lesson on what not to do","July 19, 2015","false","0.7"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","2"

You take control of two goats, Tempo and Chubbs, who must rescue their brother, Tiny, from the evil troll who kidnapped him by crossing ten bridges all the way to the troll's castle. Along the way the two brothers must jump over and slide under obstacles while the bridge falls apart behind them.\n\nThis game is certainly a challenge in single player, where you control both goats at the same time. I found that using a controller was best, as each goat is controlled by an analogue stick, while bumpers are jump and triggers are slide. You don't have to move both goats at the exact same time, you can switch your focus between them as long as you're sure not to let the bridge fall out beneath the goat you're ignoring.\n\nThere are only 10 levels at the moment, but the devs have promised FREE DLC that will add at least 10 more levels to the game, and hopefully a better (or continued) story.

You'll find yourself unable to see parts of the path where you're standing even after some attempts to adjust the angle.\n3: Your brain.

The twist is that instead of having one character that treats your commands as mere suggestions to be ignored, you have two characters that you have to control at once.  Of course, controls in the game are pretty squishy, so this just doubles the frustration.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Goats on a Bridge commits the cardinal sin of all platformers...lousy controls.  It gets worse, however, as the level design was obviously inspired by endless runners.  What this means is that obstacles are trivial and uninteresting  Maybe there are some more interesting Lost Vikings style interactions between the two goats later.  I wouldn't know.  I don't care.\n\nUltimately, I don't understand why you would play a game like this on pc.  There are way better platformers out there, and the twin path things doesn't make the game interesting, just twice as frustrating.

This is sort of a two player co-op game where you rage and hate your partner every step of the way. Only in this case, the devs make you be your own partner.\n\n2. The devs are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.\n\n3. I hate myself.\n\n4. This is seriously addictive and fun. It divides your brain and half and it feels weird and somehow makes you want your brain want your brain to feel like that even more.\n\n5. The controls are pretty solid. I like using an Xbox controller better than the keyboard controls but keyboard controls had one advantage which was that it was much harder to accidentally go on a diagonal.\n\n6. Graphics are bright and cute as is the music but this in no way alleviates the rage you feel when you get your hands mixed up and the one half of your brain goes to the wrong side of your head and left becomes right and right is wrong.\n\n7. You can bump resolutions on this game all the way up to 4k and it actually makes it look a lot more clean and nice. The downside of this is the text boxes get all small and you can't read them.\n\n8. You can't read them when you are playing anyway because you are too busy trying to figure out why the goat on the right is on the left and why when there's only one goat left, you lose.\n\n9. I still feel cross-eyed twenty minutes after my last session but my eyes are straight as arrows. It is my brain that is crossed.\n\n10. There are equipment upgrades but I never could quite figure out if they were only cosmetic.\n\n11. The camera angle in this is kinda wonky by design. You are supposed to take two goats simultaneously at the same or similar rate of speed down their own individual bridges. If you get them too far apart--which is easier but not what you're supposed to do--the camera angle gets a bit too wide to see what's going on. This encourages you to play the more challenging way by making the more challenging way less challenging than the less challenging way.\n\n12. This is the devs' first game, which they kind of wear on their sleeve a bit. It is a pretty well polished game in my opinion but there are a few things that irritated me here and there. After landing a jump or sliding under an obstacle, it seemed to take a metric hair too long to be able to jump or slide under an obstacle again. Sometimes the wonky camera angle by design seems to be a little wonky not by design. Also there are a few blind sections which seem to be there intentionally but feel unnecessary given this is a pretty hard game otherwise.\n\n13. Holy crap, I have never played a game that infected my dreams w/ weird psychic gameplay remnants in shorter sessions than this. It is basically a legal kind of drug where you pay good money to be feel very confused and yell all your best curse words for reasons those around you do not understand.","June 1","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
