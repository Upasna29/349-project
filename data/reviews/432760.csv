You know that he was sure that his rival was sabotaging his work. It's now up to you to find what Galdor's Bluff is hiding!\n\nSmall Town Terrors is a series of hidden objects games, focused on one town hiding a secret. After an evil entity and zombies, Galdor's Bluff is focusing on illusions and is less oriented in paranormal and horror themes. The story is well-written, as you don't expect the twist at the end.\n\nThe gameplay is the usual one: find items, use them in specific locations, solve puzzles, find objects thanks to a list of them or to replace the missing one to its place. The puzzles are quite easy to solve and the hidden objects scenes aren't hard at all. It's just a shame that the mechanisms of two characters you can switch are only explored in the bonus chapter.\n\nThe graphics are correct: while it's not an apocalyptic setting, it's still a town visited during the night. Though the majority of the locations are normal, some of them are situated in ruins, getting a little touch of mystery. The soundtrack is also correct.\n\nAs it's a collector's edition, you have concept arts, the bonus chapter, wallpaper and a solitaire game. Indeed, each hidden object scene can be passed thanks to a solitaire card game where you can remove cards when their sum is matching 13.\n\nThere are also achievements in-game but not on Steam, which is a little disappointement.\n\nAnyway, Galdor's Bluff is really enjoyable, way more than Livingstone but Pilgrim's Hook stays still my favorite game in the series. Anyway, you can go ahead.","February 21","true","3.4"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","14","15","0","0"
