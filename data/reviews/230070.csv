As such its important for anyone interested in this game to have a good idea of what they are getting themselves in for - which is a proper hardcore RPG.\n\nCombat is turn based and initially very hard. The creators have tried to recreate the real life danger of fighting and pretty much nailed it. Your fledgling character is able to take on one opponent at the start of the game, but fighting multiple people will more than likely get you killed. Luckily the game has multiple solutions to the problems you will face and combat is not the only path for your character.\n\nThe game has a good solid story and there are plentiful dialog options which are linked to the social skills of your character. This of course means that you could potentially play through the game as a smooth talking character with minimal combat skill. The game doesn't hand hold you in terms of what you should put your skill points into, but common sense will get you through (eg if your playing a Thief character sneak, lock pick and disguise might be useful..).\n\nThere are multiple character backgrounds which modify the story including Loremaster, Thief, Assassin, Merchant and so on. Some times the characters overlap at points in the story, so it can be interesting to see things play out from a different perspective. Even though the game is not complete (at the time of this review) the different backgrounds give replayability to the game.\n\nFinally the setting is based of post roman collapse, which is a unique setting for this type of game. Don't expect to see spells and magic flying around typical of fantasy RPGs, but there are wondrous items and locations which can be visited from a bygone era in the games lore.\n\nOverall if your sick of "baby's first RPG" and are hungry for a solid learning curve and dangerous combat in a unique setting I recommend The Age of Decadence.\n\n(Note; At the time of writing there are a number of crash issues that the game is experiencing, hopefully everything will be ironed out for the final release).","November 26, 2013","true","17.3"," 222 of 252 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","222","252","0","0"

The EA version is very much playable (there are less bugs than in many releases). The combat, which has been much the focus of attention due to its difficulty, is not awesome, but it gets the job done and it is optional.\n\n***Since for some reason Steam has decided to implement a character limit to user reviews (what's up with that Gabe?), you can read my whole review here: http:// http://steamcommunity.com/app/230070/discussions/0/666827315713399977/ , but below is a very long extract:\n\nAoD is a turn based cRPG set in a post-apocalyptic low magic/low tech world. So naturally one might think that this is something like Fallout in a “fantasy” (as opposed to sci-fy) setting. But it’s not and both games suffer from this comparison.\n\nSo, if it’s not Fallout in a low fantasy setting, then what is AoD? The best way to approach this is by considering that cRPGs tend to be very long games, with the first playthrough taking at least 20-30 hours. A first playthrough of AoD EA version, which according to the devs contains about 60% of the final content of the game, can take anywhere between an hour and 5 hours. However, while in the typical cRPG you see about 80% of the content in the first playthrough, in AoD you see anywhere between 5% and 15%.\n\nThis has a huge impact on how you are meant to play the game, the importance of which cannot be understated. It took me a long time to realize this, despite warnings from other players and the devs on the forum. You are not meant to constantly save the game and load it when you die or when something goes wrong. If you do this, paradoxically, the game becomes much more difficult and frustrating than it is, particularly when it comes to combat. This is because you can’t compensate through luck “bad” playing character stats, as AoD gives very little margin to luck. The problem is that at first it might seem exactly the opposite, because even though the to hit chances (expressed as a %) are low, you think “if I get a bit lucky with a couple of hits, I can pull this off”. But the outcome is not decided by a few very lucky rolls: you have to be consistently better than your opponent (e.g. not like in Fallout, where you can finish or disable an opponent with a single lucky shot). But, not realizing this at first, you save before a combat and reload when you fail, which you will do again and again. I’ll return to the combat in AoD in more detail later.\n\nSo how does the game play? Essentially you move your PC around in a fully 3d isometric view. Combat is never automatically triggered; it is always preceded by a dialogue window, more often than not giving you the chance to avoid it. You can talk to NPCs, examine some objects in the environment, or very occasionally pick up “loot” on the map. You don’t “hunt” for containers, checking every pixel for chests, drawers, bag, barrels, etc. You don’t worry about enemies spotting you, you can’t “turn on” sneak, there are no traps, pool of poisonous green goo to avoid, etc. The main view is, so to speak, just a convenient tool for showing how the world is and what is around you, allowing for some exploration and generally getting the character from one place to another. You can also use a map for convenient quick travel, and many times in a dialogue you have the option to appear directly in the place you want to go to. The meat of the game is in dialogues with NPCs, text adventures and combat.\n\nAs to the dialogues and the text adventures, their outcome depends a lot on PC stats, to a lesser degree on prior game choices and occasionally on equipment. And they are very good! Actually, they are so good that it is very rewarding to play a PC who doesn’t get into a single combat (yes, you can definitely play through the whole game without having any combat encounters at all). They are generally very well written (minor criticism: the swearing arsenal seems limited to the f word, which makes me miss Annah and Morte from Planescape Torment), the NPCs descriptions, motivations and actions are very solid and follow an iron logic action-consequence pattern, the PC has many different options when approaching them and more often than not they allow for a lot of roleplaying and expressing how your PC is. The mechanics themselves are unremarkable, but what AoD manages to accomplish through them is brilliant.\n\nA warning though: because the outcome of both dialogues and text adventures is largely determined by skill checks (e.g. you must have a persuasion of 4 to convince an NPC) and as a player you have no way of knowing what level of skill you must have to pass it (it’s not shown in the text and you can’t possibly derive the exact number from the context), at first you might feel very frustrated that you don’t get the best outcome (or even fail, which in some cases means outright dying) because of something so silly and arbitrary. But it’s part of the game design that every PC can only get the best outcome in some cases and that you die a lot. Remember that each playthrough is relatively short; this is not Dragon Age where you invest 50 hours in building a PC. AoD is meant to be replayed many-many times, and the story and the world come together as you replay the game following different paths and failing in many of them . I can’t stress this enough: you gain insight into the story, the NPCs and the setting when your PC fails/dies, thus losing is an integral part of playing AoD.\n\nAs to combat, as I mentioned earlier, there is very little luck involved. If you face an opponent against whom your stats and equipment compare unfavorably (not in absolute, but relative terms, i.e. your stats and equipment don’t allow you to have an advantage over your opponent) you will lose. Again and again and again. The room for tactics in combat is also quite limited: there is positioning (counterintuitively, this usually means getting yourself into a corner where you are attacked by the fewest number of opponents at the same time), armor, quite a few different attacks (but ultimately not that different between them) and some variations between weapons of the same class and some auxiliary thingies you can use (like nets and alchemy bombs, but not much more, at least in the current version). Breaking it down, I think it would be fair to say that the outcome of combat depends mostly on the stats and equipment, somewhat on tactics, and very marginally on luck.\n\nPersonally, even though now I feel quite comfortable with combat in AoD (I better, after sinking so many hours into it) and I don’t find it too difficult or frustrating, I’m not thrilled by it. It does get the job done and it’s important to realize that without a very serious investment in AI, the most practical way of making combat hard (as is part of the game design) is to make it dependent on stats and populating the world with opponents with high stats. If tactics played a larger role, a human player would have a huge advantage over the AI controlled NPCs, which would go against the whole philosophy of the game.\n\nFortunately, you can play AoD without ever getting into combat. To avoid it you just have to be cautious in your dialogues and text adventures, which means as a rule of thumb behaving as you would in a real life situation (e.g. if you see some thugs, don’t approach them; if they ask you for money, give it to them). The best thing that can be said about combat in AoD is that it does succeed in making combat a very dangerous business that one should avoid unless very confident about his or her martial skills.

Its turn based combat is pretty darn brutal when you first start playing the game, you need to specialise and learn the system. I can certainly see some people getting frustrated with it and giving up, but it's fairly satisfying once you get the hang of it.\n\nOf course, you can build an entirely non-combat character and get through the entire game without ever having to lift a weapon. There's tons of skill and dialogue and reputation based options to use, but again you need to specialise.\n\nThe game really does change depending on which faction you align with, so it's good for more than one playthrough.

But I don’t think it's enough to just say that we have here another good revival title. Though it's look and feel will be familiar to fans of the genre, The Age of Decadence strains so impressively against the reins of what we have come to expect from a game that it may just land us at the leading edge of new territory.\n\nSure, all of the staples are here. Nice isometric view graphics paint the adventure around you...check. Stat and skill based character creation allowing for a nice variety of playstyles...check. Compelling storyline with strong writing...check. Immersive world lore...check. A world crafted specifically for revealing it's secrets to you as it builds your character into a world saving hero and providing you with believable illusions of consequence...che……..no. No. The world reveals nothing to you for free. You are not a hero or a special snowflake. And you are not pampered by mere illusions of consequences to your choices. You are served very real consequences. And that’s a special thing.\n\nThe Age of Decadence provides a wonderfully immersive world. And it respects the player enough to not bend that world’s consequences in a way that favors our character. It's a harsh place full of backstabbing, intrigue, and power plays. And the game says, hey player, act as you want and I will show you what happens to a character like yours when they do those things. If you play the role well you may find that you excel in your ventures. Play the role poorly and you'll quickly discover that you’re just another subpar assassin or merchant that gets to die in the gutter like all of the other hack jobs out there whose aspirations outweighed their qualities.\n\nThe decisions are tough. Make an ally here, create an enemy there. The narrative consequences that unfold due to your actions and choices are, to my knowledge,  unparalleled in gaming. And Age of Decadence does something really fascinating. You WILL NOT see all there is to see in one play through and that is because each faction/alliance playthrough is served it's on unique view into the story that is unfolding. Honestly, I am not one to replay cRPGs but The Age of Decadence compels you to do so. There’s almost a Butterfly Effect in that as you explore these parallel story lines you get to see just how consequential your actions were when you served that other factions interests.\n\nThere are many ways to play the game but however you play it, you'll want to stay true to that character concept. If you’re a smooth talking merchant that’s avoided physical conflict your whole life honing your silver tongue, then exercise all of the caution that character would when things look like they could get physical. The game isn’t going to coddle your poor decisions. Get in the head of that character and respect the world around him or her in the same ways that they would. Playing a talker, you will learn very little about how combat works. Play a physical character and you will be playing a whole new game as you plumb the depths of the rewarding combat system.\n\nThe Age of Decadence won’t be for everyone. It's unforgiving nature will be a downer for some. But if you like the idea of real choice and consequences, richly written dialogue and plot, and a gritty brutal setting...then you owe it to yourself to give it a try. And there’s a demo, so try that first!","October 14, 2015","true","78.3"," 125 of 139 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","125","139","2","3"

While Wasteland 2, Pillars of Eternity and Divinity: Original Sin has played a big part in the resurrection of the cRPG-genre, Age of Decadence has long since carved out it's own path. Make no mistake, this is a niche game that's sure to be overlooked by many.\n\nIn Age of Decadence your actions will have, often dire, consequences. Your choices DO matter and they will shape the story, characters and locations. There's a sense of satisfaction in persuading one of your enemies to ambush a third common enemy, thus securing a location for one of your allies. There's a feeling of dread when a dangerous situation is about to get out of hand and the only option left is to fight for your life. There's a sense of accomplishment when you finally realize the use for an old artefact.\n\nSuch sensations are rarely present while playing modern RPG:s and it alone should be the reason to try out Age of Decadence. Granted it's not the best looking game, neither is it particularly welcoming to new players. Actually, even hardcore cRPG-players will have a hard time grasping how Age of Decadence is meant to be played. If you think even for a second that your wealthy merchant will be able to talk his way out of an ambush in the slum district just because you've maxed out your charisma and persuasion skills you'll be sorely disappointed.\n\nPlay this game as you would if you were actually an assassin, mercenary, loremaster, trader or diplomat and you are a lot more likely to succeed. Of course you can still play as a tough merchant, but then you'll have to actually commit to that role. Carrying all that cash in your pocket while visiting a dangerous part of town without (or with...) escort is usually a bad idea.\n\nNow, enjoy a well-written story with enough branching storylines to make your head spin. And don't feel bad when you die in the first fight. It's an achievement after all.","October 13, 2015","true","94.4"," 147 of 170 people (86%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","86","147","170","12","9"

This is not the approach that one ought to enter the world of AoD with because it's a game structured mostly on interactivity and replayability. A single playthrough might not see more than a 6th of the total content the game offers. I'll try to illustrate why this is so.\n\nEvery character is given a 'main quest' which basically boils down to 'find the ancient temple'(not the most interesting hook but please keep reading) but most of the game and narrative content are explored through various 'faction quests' given by organisations that the player character can join. There are altogether 7 of these 'factions': The Imperial Guards(or the army), The Merchant's Guild(think less trading and more political manipulation), The Thieves Guild and The Assassin's guild on top of those there are 3 Noble Houses which you can join and work for.\n\nThese questlines are exclusive so a character which works for the Imperial Guards doesn't have access to the quests offered to for example the Assassins’ guild and so most of the game's content will be not shown to any given character by design. There is also the fact that most(okay all) of the questlines offer various ways of progressing through them depending on the skillset of your character s.\n\nYour faction allegiance also isn't rigid that you pick at the start of the game and are stuck with until the end, there is plenty of opportunities to switch sides if you feel that the current situation doesn't suit your character enough.\n\nThus there is plenty of fun to have with every single character but the game can only be truly experienced and enjoyed if given multiple playthroughs.\n\n\n\nAnother important thing to consider with this game is that it's more than possible to make a bad character.(this is mostly related to combat) AoD has a combat and character construction system that you have to master in order to defeat the game, it's not a really a hard system to master but you might throw a few potential characters into the bin straight away as you start up.\n\nGood advice for attribute and skill point distribution is to be conservative and focus on only a few(2-3) skills. Most every situation can be solved in various ways so if you plan for you character to be a talker you can safely ignore combat stats and if you plan to only fight you can safely ignore some of the more social skills like 'persuasion' and 'streetwise'.(hybrid characters are possibly and rewarding however such concepts are best tried after having played through the game at least once or twice to get a taste for it)\n\nThe combat itself is a single unit turn based(squares) game with various weapon types and various attack types and two distinct defence attributes(dodge/block) each with it's own benefits and drawbacks. Combat is also affected by skills like crafting(which offer higher quality equipment) and alchemy for various poisons, performance enhancing drugs and bombs. It's based around action points. Which means that you have a given pool(decided by your attributes/armour) and various actions(including movement) cost various amounts of action points.\n\nSuccess in combat encounters is decided by the stats and skills your character has and your creative use of tactics with roughly 60-40 in favour of the first measure in an average combat encounter.\n\n\nThere is also a demo avalible so you could try that out before buying the game to see if you like it.","July 16, 2015","true","189.3"," 85 of 103 people (83%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","83","85","103","3","1"

It's also one of the best games I've played in close to 30 years of gaming.\n\nThis game reacts to your choices in a way very few games do.  If you help one noble house, you risk alienating another.  And this has consequences that affect the ending you get, the quests you receive and your path through the game.  All of this adds to replayability and to see the whole game you will have to playthrough multiple times.  Each playthrough should take about 10-20 hours depending on how thorough you are.\n\nThis is also a game that gives you multiple options to get through a quest.  One of the early quests in the game gives you the task of investigating an archeological dig that is being conducted by a rival house.  You are given multiple options with how to resolve this quest:\nYou can fight your way through.\nYou can find who is supplying food to the guards at the dig and convince them to poison the food.\nYou can convince some raiders from another quest to attack the dig, killing two birds with one stone.\nYou can impersonate someone that the guards at the dig are waiting for and infiltrate the site.\nYou can side with the other house and assist them with the dig.\nYou can ignore the quest completely.Note that while all of these options are available (and I might have missed a stealth option), not all of these options are available to every character.  The game demands that you specialize and while specialization will open some solutions and quests, it will close others.  For example, the character who specializes in negotiation and diplomatic skills to convince the raiders to attack the dig, will not have the combat skills to fight their way through the guards.  That means that the combat heavy quests, like becoming a gladiator, will be closed to that character.\n\nThe combat in this game is fairly challenging.  You will only control one character in the game, although you may have NPC allies, and most of the time you are badly outnumbered.  Combat is turn-based and you action points that you spend for actions like movement and attacking.  Different attacks have different action point costs and you target specific locations for various effects, e.g. you can attack an opponent’s legs to make them easier to hit.  The penalties you impose on your enemies with these attack stack and you also have special attacks with consumable items like nets, flasks of Greek-fire and grenades.  The enemies also have these abilities and they use them fairly effectively.\n\nThis means that combat can have a snowball effect, e.g. you might be fighting an opponent who you can defeat quite easily, then they land a lucky leg hit against you, which lets them land another and soon you are defenseless and being torn apart.  While you can use this snowball effect to your advantage, because you are outnumbered it tends to be to your disadvantage more often than not.  This is really a game where one bad roll can lose you the battle, while I like this, I can understand how it would be frustrating to many players.\n\nWhile the game is well written and offers many paths through the game, there is a sense of diminishing quality as the game progresses.  The second town for example feels very empty compared to the first town, and the game feels a little rushed towards the end.  There are also two stories going on simultaneously, there is a civil war and the exploration of the ruins.  The stories are linked, but the skills you need to explore the ruins might not be the skills your character needs to support their faction in the civil war.  Such a character will end up missing half the game on their playthrough.\nThe game is also not without some bugs.  While I have not encountered any game-breaking bugs, I have encountered updates to quests that cannot be completed, or characters forgetting some of the things that I have done.  However these bugs are few and far between.\n\nSynopsis: if you liked Fallout 1 and 2, Wasteland 2, or just a good story driven RPG, give this game a try.  However, this is not a game where you can do everything in one playthrough, so be prepared to playthrough it a couple of times if you want the whole story.\n","December 15, 2015","true","161.3"," 76 of 93 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","76","93","2","6"

When it comes to video games, I seem to completely share the same opinions and tastes as the lead designer; I'm a bit of a fanboy of his so that only increased my hype.\n\nI've enjoyed playing it, but I do have numerous issues with the game. I completed this game soon after release and was planning to only submit this after having played it several more times and editing in additional thoughts, but I haven't had the time to do that so I'm just going to post this review as is, though I will probably end up adding additional thoughts whenever I get around to playing it more (and I expect my opinion of certain aspects such as the story to improve after spending more time with non-combat characters). The following review might contain minor spoilers.\n\nStory, Writing & Quests\n\nI found the writing and story pretty good but if I'm honest I expected better. Some parts, especially Ganezzar, feel very rushed to me. The ending is unbelievably abrupt and anti-climactic. The choices and consequences weren't as frequent or as important as I expected from Vault 'Choices and Consequences' Dweller; it seems like the biggest choices are right before you see a story slide, which I think should be secondary to in-game effects. If I side with a faction, I want this choice to affect me; perhaps if I betrayed them, they send assassins after me or something in the next town over? Things like that. But the consequences were rarely there from what I could tell.  Half the reputation systems aren't ever checked so are literally pointless and the other half are checked infrequently.\n\nThere wasn't as much to do in cities as I would've expected; if combat was as easy as it is in, say, Fallout 1/2, I think the game would go by WAY too quickly. Certainly could've done with more quests and I hope that they add some more in the next 3 months of development.\n\nCombat & Skill system\n\nMany people claim that the combat is too difficult. It's not uncommon for people to struggle to get past the first fight and it's recommended that you restart with different builds until you find the right one. This wasn't necessary for me, and I found every fight apart from two quite manageable. Occasionally there would be a fight that I couldn't do right away, but going away for a bit and doing a few quests to get some skill points and then returning solved that. The only two fights I had severe trouble with were the Aurelian Outpost, which I'm pretty sure wasn't possible with the character build I had at the time, and an end game fight that I'm not sure is even possible for anyone to win.\n\nSo overall I thought the difficulty was good. Not too difficult, not too easy. You have to reload regularly but it doesn't get to absurd levels. Even if you do have to reload a bunch of times, it never bothered me much because you're very quickly back into the action. I tend to only get frustrated in games where there's needless tedium, such as in Dark Souls where you have to constantly, needlessly, run back to the challenging part through a bunch of weak enemies, which to me seems as though they might as well give you a maths problem to do before you can get through the fog door. It doesn't add anything.\n\nThat said, I was disappointed with the tactical elements. I was playing an assassin with a dagger (speaking of daggers, I got a steel dagger in Teron (I believe) and not ONCE did I ever find an opportunity to upgrade it throughout the rest of the game. Unique and high quality metal shields, hammers and swords coming out my ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, but not a single good dagger. Why?) and high dodge with some critical strike added to the mix. I very rarely found any reason to use anything other than Arterial Strike. As far as I can tell, the only reason to use anything else is if 1) you don't have enough AP (I had 12 AP, so for me that only occurred when I had moved the same turn), 2) the opponent is lightly armoured (so, like, <10% of enemies?) or 3) the opponent was really hard to hit. There wasn't a reason to use other aimed attacks from what I could tell, I tried them out but I'd rather do 10-15 damage than cripple their AP very slightly for a few turns. I thought Aimed: Torso might be useful so 100% of my dagger's damage wouldn't be absorbed like it is with every attack apart from Arterial Strike, but no; that too was much worse than Arterial Strike.\n\nNumerous skills, such as Traps, seem to be really underutilised.\n\nPersonally, I think that you get too few civil skill points. Combat skill points are fine, no need to increase those, but as an assassin I would've liked to have been able to have felt like a more competent one who could do more than just fight. I feel like the design limited my character too much and I would've liked to have been decent at Streetwise, Lockpick, Sneak and Impersonate, all skills I'd associate with an assassin. Presumably the reasoning for not giving more is to encourage replaying with other builds, so this is somewhat understandable.\n\nTechnical Issues\n\nGraphically the game isn't a champ, but that's no surprise from a small indie team with a low budget. Some areas managed to look quite nice and had a good artistic vision, such as the monastery.\n\nI had dozens of crashes throughout my playthrough, some of which happened JUST as I beat a fight I had been reloading on for awhile, which was rather frustrating. At times the game would randomly decide to crash before I could get to the menu screen over and over, so I had to close Steam and start is as admin before it would work. The next day, that fix didn't work so I had to directly launch AoD.exe as admin.\n\nAt one stage, in Ganezzar, the game stopped recognising my saves and started listing them as 'beta saves' and a lot of them got corrupted all of a sudden. That could've been the end of my playthrough right there, but luckily I save like a mad man and had a suitable backup from 20-30 minutes ago that didn't get corrupted.\n\nA few times when starting fights or going into buildings, enemies would be invisible and I had to reload to fix it.\n\nAt one stage, I failed a Dexterity check despite having 10 Dexterity.\n\nThere were some other really minor niggles like a few typos here and there; surprisingly the very first line spoken to you when you start as an assassin had a typo!\n\nI know how difficult it is to test these things and make the game run well on all systems, so I don't consider these issues much of a big deal.\n\nConclusion\n\nOverall this review has sounded quite negative, but that's a problem I have where I don't know how to review anything other than by pointing out its flaws and going from there. I enjoyed AoD, I think it's easily the best RPG in years and MUCH better than recent games like Pillars of Eternity. Any fan of classic isometric turn-based CRPGs needs to play this game. I'm really glad that Iron Tower Studio is going to continue making games and I will definitely be buying any of their future games including the upcoming  AoD dungeon crawler.","November 29, 2015","true","23.3"," 77 of 99 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","77","99","0","3"

The closest thing I can think of are those CYOA gamebooks, or a western version of Way of The Samurai, with a complex turn-based combat on top.\n\nThe complete opposite of Skyrim - where even a dumb orc can be Archmage of Winterhold -, Age of Decadence presents a coherent and realistic world, where you must weight your decisions carefully, based on your strengths and weakness. This is the first game that when thugs asked me for a toll to get through a street, I actually payed instead of just killing them all, because even one thug could easily kill my merchant.\n\nIt is a dangerous world out there, not a pandering power-fantasy like most RPGs, and you'll have to use all your skills just to stay alive, and even more to actually succeed. Sometimes backing away from a tough fight, or walking away empty-handed will be your only escape from a gruesome death.\n\nObviously it's not a game for everyone, but those looking for a challenging game that doesn't threat you like a baby will be more than pleased. It's hard to take other RPGs seriously after playing Age of Decadence.","December 2, 2013","true","23.3"," 73 of 95 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","73","95","0","5"

It is a paradise for people who love to metagame, try and fail, try again and succeed and love to search for hidden content like pieces of lore, character bits, easter eggs, hard skill checks and hidden endings. It is an utter terror for people who are used to games with flat difficulty curve and being rewarded without struggling for reward. It is actually a game where Steam achievements are something you wear proudly like medals for your survival.\nDevelopers also tried hard to squeeze as much as possible from Fallout's turn-based combat and actually succeeded. For a system where you control only one character and have just a handful of action points, while also constantly facing multiple enemies at once, it has surprising level of depth to it due to unique attacks, huge arsenal of weapons (none of which are completely unplayable, although some being easier to handle), consumables (which are essential for your survival in this game) and small mechanical features (like weapon and armor Hardness, critical hits and such).\nWhile visuals of AoD are outdated, many locations are actually very atmospheric and writing and music make up for that.\n\nThere are, however, some things that drag the game down and make what could have been a marvel into flawed gem.\nThe first one is that engine is outdated and game is not systemic, not even on a level of, say, first Fallout, or Ultima's, Arcanum or Deus Ex. Most of the things are done via text quests instead of player actively trying out and combining skills and objects inside the game by mouse. Pressing [TAB] will reveal most active spots around character and then it's just a matter of having right skills or items, as your options are clearly presented to you as a list.\nIt makes game especially easy as talker-character, as you can completely avoid combat via skill checks, while in other games it's usually challenging because you have to use things like stealth, spells or know game very well to make a "pacifist" run.\nGame tries to subvert this sometimes as there are decisions that are not obvious, like switching factions, or some dialogues actually make you pay attention as you get bonuses to skill checks if you choose right answers, but first depends on how well particular quest line is written, and latter is only used rarely, so there are no text quests turning into actual puzzles like, for example, in Space Rangers.\nThis makes game a lot more reactive than proactive, which is why exploring ancient sites and finding hidden endings and easter eggs become more fun later after game held your hand during some of the guild quests.\nDevelopers continue to try and fight this by adding even more skill checks where it is appropriate and providing players with even more options, but without proper systems it is an uphill battle and creates a huge cluster**** of scripts and variables that are hard to perfect.\n\nSecond thing that can't but make you sigh during big battles is, of course, that you can only control one character. Sure, it has been set in stone, probably from development day 1, but still... There are so many weapons and builds you can try that it would require many playthroughs to run them all, and even with a party of 3 characters, combat would become a lot more tactical and require less metagaming - as for now many battles require you to have a particularly high defensive skill or good armor to even stand a chance to survive first round or two and make use of your options.\nIt also makes many battles a chore to replay, as in some of them your impact is small and sometimes allies can win battle for you.\n\nAnd third thing which is a mixed bag is, of course, the writing.\nIt is a mix of genuinely interesting politicking and exploration, memorable characters, constant betrayals and your character trying to prove himself, encyclopedic lore dumps, cool plot twists and viperous pragmatism, Roman decorations, characters interpreting history, characters forgetting their history, characters making new history and **aliens** (hands gesture).\nGame writing begins resembling someting like Roman "Thieves World", dabbles into politics and then suddenly makes and awkward jump into ancient technomagic and makes every character rush for a search for deus ex machina, which can change everything you did, thus seemingly cancelling that what I thought to be main idea behind design of the game and also behind every good plot - cause and effect.\nIt is particularly boring and banal to read ancient history through various journals and consoles that suddenly manifest in large numbers during endgame, instead of trying to figure it through interpretations of people who live here and now like in the beginning of the game.\n\nBut my own personal gripe with story of AoD is that it doesn't do Roman setting justice it deserves. There is some "Rome" in Praetor story, but not enough for me. I was waiting for flavourful descriptions of deaths of ancient rulers (with their eyes replaced with sapphires and liquid metal mixed with **** poured over their heads - just like in my friend's favorite book!), political marriages, conflicts between free people and slaves (and of course me buying slaves for my own protection and leisure), but probably the most "Roman" story in the game happened not with me, but with a wonderful scumbag Miltiades, who did in the game things that I wanted to do myself. It is always bit sad when NPCs do cooler stuff than you, and it's not even particularly epic stuff.\n\nWith all that said, I invested 100+ hours into the game. And unlike many other games where these hours are generally repeating same stuff, reading same text, meeting same characters, in AoD very often you will find yourself doing completely different things. Even combat builds change the way you play and battles you choose, and of course there is a ton of hidden and locked content in the game waiting for persistent players to find.\nIt is a joy of a game with completely different, no-bul**** approach that doesn't work in compromises, and you either accept that and try, struggle and win, or... good ****ing riddance.","November 3, 2015","true","139.8"," 64 of 83 people (77%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","77","64","83","3","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/danielo83/recommended/230070/","danielo83","Starwars","http://steamcommunity.com/id/danielo83/","209 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nDo you have a death wish? If so, you've come to the right game!\n\nI've played a fair amount of the Age of Decadence (AoD), having been one of the first beta-testers for the title (most of my playtime are with non-STEAM builds). And I've died. Oh how I've died.\n\nTo make things plain, AoD is not a game you'd play when you want to go on a conventional videogame "powertrip". It's not a game you'd play when you want to play a hero. It's not a game you'd play when you want to play an ubermensch. In this game, your character is but one choice from death at pretty much all times.\n\nAoD is a RPG with turnbased combat. It features a very deep and quite broad RPG system. Choices & consequences is the name of the game here, playthroughs vary *wildly* from one another. With the pre-requisite that you'll get your hands dirty, this game features very different ways to go through the game. On one hand, you can choose to play something like a Mercenary, killing your way through the game. Very, very hard (choosing the combat path in this game is *the* difficult choice interestingly enough) but very doable. Or, you can play a slimy Merchant, bribing and persuading your way through the game without ever entering combat.\n\nThis heavy emphasis on choice is why I adore AoD. There is a *true* sense of your character forging your way through the world. Even if you happen to fail a certain skill check and screw a situation for your employer when working for one of the guilds, chances are the game will still allow you to continue though the guild and gameworld will likely remember what you've done.\n\nThe turnbased combat may feel slightly clunky at first due to how it looks and "feels". But here is a combat system that actually has some immense depth to it, *if* you have the patience to go through the trial-by-fire where you'll die over and over. Encounters are crafted carefully and to provide immense challenge. Not to mention that your character is just another piece of the game's board. You're not special, you're not more powerful than anyone else. You're just another dude who happens to excel at a few things (depending on your skill choices) and so is everyone else. In another game, you'd scoff at the group of thugs threatening you in the slums. In AoD? You'd best be damn well prepared if you're gonna take on *any* group of people.\n\nMy main critique of the gameplay is that, since so much of the game is driven by your characters' skill choices, you can quite easily get into a situation where you're just just shy of one measly point of Persuasion to get through that particular problem, but... you may have no way to get that point. And the other options can likely lead you into death (especially if you're not prepared for combat). It feels rather "strict". And while I actually like that in many ways, I do hope and think there will be a balancing pass on the game before it's final release. Hopefully "loosening up" some of the requirements without making the game casual or easy.\n\nThe game relies heavily on its writing with most of its non-combat gameplay missions taking place in very elaborate "text-adventures". If you don't like to read, this is not the game for you.\nThe game's writing is very good and quite harsh. There are no goody-goody characters here, and it's rough world. Characters will lie to you and screw you over. But the good news is, you can lie to others and screw them over as well!\n\nThe game's length will vary a *lot* depending on how you play. Combat is the most time-consuming tasks. Battles can take a fair amount of time. If you choose to go a route where you are diplomatic and avoid combat, the game-length will also be shorter.\nThat said, one of the main *points* behind AoD is the replayability. If you don't want to replay the game, using different builds and seeing different solutions, then it's not a game for you.\n\nThe game is currently in early access and has a few months left of development. The game is made up of 3 big city locations (with various smaller locations scattered around) and the final big city is about to be released in a rough, beta form to the public. There is still plenty of things to do and experience in the game but it is not currently "complete" so to speak.\n\nIf you want to be challenged by a RPG, and if you like old-school design and feel, then AoD might just be worth it for you. For me, it has filled a niche that no other game has done yet (even right now with Kickstarter projects and indie-games being as prominent as they are), it is truly a special game that I've grown to love, despite the many kicks in the balls it has given me.\n\nI'd highly recommend it for people looking for a more hardcore RPG experience. But to be on the safe side, you can give the demo a try as well!\n","January 19, 2015","true","20.7"," 57 of 74 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","57","74","0","0"

(Or is it???)\nTL;DR, I recommend you buy it.\n\nThe game is a throwback to the 90s Fallout, before it made the leap to FPS. Meaning it's a classless system with stats and skillpoints in an isometric playing field, with factions and enemies looking for more power with you thrown into all this, at a pivotal moment in history. I'm gonna break down the review to COMBAT, SKILLS and STORY.\n\nCOMBAT: Rich tactical options with tough difficulty. The tactical options are almost as diverse as the ones found in the Temple of Elemental Evil. Should I fire my crossbow bolt now, or do I bait them so I can unleash a timely whirlwind? Should I heal myself now or save it for another encounter later? The choices, and consequences, are yours.\n\nSKILLS: Skills matter. You can't be an overpowered master of all here, you have to choose a path and stick with it. While there are numerous encounters in the game, these do not give enough skill points for you to be a god of everything. I learned this the hard way, early on I played a jack of trades guy, who got into some quests, but got locked out during certain points due to lack of skills. Pick a profession and skills and focus on that as you make your way in this post-apocalyptic Rome. As an aside, alchemy did save my life more often than not, so I would recommend that.\n\nSTORY: You have to pay attention to the walls of text. This is a throwback to the 80s and 90s RPGs, where there's not much voice acting, but a lot of exposition and character development done through the text. There's a complex plot involving "gods" and "demons" in the game, so you'll have to pay attention to all of it. DISCLOSURE: I have not finished the game myself, but I have encountered a "DEMON" and I'll leave it at that. There's something big going on, and I intend to get to the bottom of it.\n\nBottomline: If you want to see more RPGs from Iron Tower, you have to buy this game. I have enjoyed every hour I put into it.

If done right, you can dance around the enemies.\n*Mutliple Arching Story paths that can drastically change the end game.

Combat has multiple paths and even wily merchant type characters can do a good job.\n\n-Bad Points-\n*Difficulty is this games name. Death is sudden and brutal and for casual perps this will end their run and make them refund the game. Why is this bad? Because the casual's are yanking their money away from the company and steam. Removing support for a wellmade game.\n*Clunky poisoning system. It is hard to poison whole sets of throwing or missile weapons. I do not know if this is intended or not, but it makes it hard to poison 20 throwing knives.\n*Armor Penalty, there is no amazing fancy set of awesome looking armor that only benefits. One must choose between armors that look awesome but weigh you down or being a dodge fanatic.\n\n!Conclusion of Bad Points: I had a stupid hard time to give bad points and honestly believe the ones I put up are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.

Knowing virtually nothing of the game other than the basic premise, I couldn't have been more pleased with my purchase. It's rare that a game in 2015 completely enraptures you as wholly as AoD did to me. Even more impressive is that the game is still unfinished (although most of the content is available at this time).\n\nThe game is hard. There's no avoiding this fact, and it may turn off a good portion of players. Other reviews are not kidding when they say that you are not a hero; the game is incredibly unforgiving, and one wrong dialogue choice can leave you facing five thugs in a back alley. Unlike most games (or maybe just the games I've experienced), Age of Decadence lies to you. A lot. I tend to roleplay as a virtuous defender of the weak in most games - but instead of my generosity being rewarded, it is my naivety that is punished. Attempt to defend a man harrassed by a gang in an alley? Dead. Pay a guide to lead you through dangerous territory? Dead. Share a conversation with a traveler alone by his fire? Poisoned, and dead shortly after. "Survival of the fittest" is the law of AoD, and it makes sure to remind you of this fact at every opportunity.\n\nThis is a breath of fresh air if you're tired of RPGs following the same formula. There is incredible replay value here, and you will certainly create multiple characters to experience the different viewpoints the storyline has to offer. One man cannot do everything, and there are even areas of the game restricted unless you explicitly design your character to be able to reach them.\n\nYou are forced to min/max in a sense, and your first playthrough will likely be scrapped once you discover what the game requires of you. A jack-of-all-trades character will not succeed in this world.\n\nAll in all, this game isn't for everyone.

The original review below is just me being an idiot, but the truth is this. I've done 4 complete playthroughs now and each time I've found new areas, quests I've missed, alternate solutions, and pieced together more of how everything fits in to the story. The game has far and away the most reactivity based on your choices in an RPG I've ever seen, and though you can't do everything with every character the game is short enough that starting a new character and playing through from a completely different perspective isn't a daunting time commitment. To top it all off it has a great setting (Rome-like civilization in a post apocalyptic sci-fi/fantasy world) to boot. Absolutely fantastic.\n\nOriginal review:\nYou will know true decadence as you recline on a sofa of the finest writing as a nubile young choice hand-picks consequences and places them in your mouth and you watch nearly naked turn based combat fight for your enjoyment. You clap your hands to advance the festivities and are then treated to a unique setting singing for you and a roasted in-depth character skill system is brought in.\nMid way through the event you feel sick and rush to the bathroom, only to void your bowels as your character dies over and over again.

The storyline, characters, and writing are great with extremely memorable events that bring you into a harsh world of betrayal and power. No black and white moral choices here to fill up a gauge, just your own sense of pragmatism and honor to contend with. The combat can be extremely difficult, but if you plan ahead, fight tactically, and occassionally sacrifice your allies you will end up on top. This is one of the few game where I can't hoard consumables until the final fight, items like primitive bombs or alchemical vials can change the course of combat.\n\nThe graphical quality is indie but the art style is great and each location is handcrafted and unique. There is no filler in this game, every quest has interesting angles or options, most of which you will not discover on your first playthrough. Did I mention that there are 8 starting character classes each with its own storyline? Compound that with the amount of choice and consequence in the game and you will be replaying this for a long time. Anyone who is a fan of the old Black Isle RPGs or more recent fare like Underrail is going to love this game.

So many different ways to do things.  I've always been a big fan of turn based strategy RPGs and if you are too then you'll like this one.  What I find most appealing is that if a particular fight is too difficult, there are about a million different ways to make it easier.  I play an Assassin with some Alchemy skill so before a difficult fight I make sure I have many different bombs, fire vials, poisons, etc.  In most games I find these things useless however in this one I couldn't fight without it.  Many games have crafting and alchemy options that are pretty much just additions without any real use except for making healing potions however this one actually puts these things to good use.\n\nThe one negative I've been having is the numerous crashes.  I've played for 4.5 hours since release and had about 6 crashes.

Lots of stat-bound dialogue, where skills and stats unlock new options with their own outcomes. Combat is hard but quite intelligently implemented. Lots of options for different manouvers that varies greatly over different weapons and fighting styles. further enhanced by crafting and alchemy.

Very rich, deep, immersive world. Despite the graphical limitations (not a complaint, btw, I love them the way they are), the world feels very alive and encompassing. The excellent writing, both narrative and dialogue, fuel this feature and set this game apart from so many on the market today. The learning curve is fairly steep and most of the negative reviews I have read stem from that fact. This isn't a Bethesda sandbox. Your character cannot and will never be able to 'do everything' at once. Initially, you will only do a very few things very well. As you learn the game and the story, you'll be able to expand a bit on subsequent playthroughs and be more multi-faceted.\n\nThere is an incredible story here, with dozens of smaller, elegantly-interconnected side stories woven throughout. Perhaps the most satsifying aspect of the experience is discovering different angles to each story depending on which faction you ally with.  It is really fascinating to worry your mind at a plot 'hole' when playing an Imperial soldier only to have it fully explained much later on during  your 40 Thieves playthrough.  Very smoothly put together narrative running behind the scenes here.\n\nIf there's one complaint, I suppose it would be the 'linear' nature of the game. Personally, I don't mind it, as I understand its necessity in order to tell a cohesive, meaningful story. But some people probably will mind it, so I mention it here. There are MANY different paths through the game and it will require several playthroughs to see them all. But once you've chosen your 'path' for a particular playthrough, that path generally runs on the rails until it completes.  Which isn't to say that you can't change paths partway through, if you're good enough to survive betraying your masters. ;) Each path also has significant choices you can make which will dramatically affect the life of your character and, in rare cases, the fate of the faction you serve or the world as a whole.  So while there is some linearity in order to maintain the story, you do have a reasonable measure of liberty within that structure.\n\nA truly great game here. A masterwork, in my estimation. I've had more fun with this title than I have with most in the past few seasons.  I hope that those of you who follow my recommendation and take a chance on it find the experience as rich and rewarding as I have.","November 17, 2015","true","124.2"," 39 of 49 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","39","49","0","0"

Then you die.\n\nA lot.\n\nThe Age of Decadence is an unforgiving experience that won’t hold your hand through any of it, set in a post-apocalyptic ancient world after the fall of a great empire, you don’t play some sort of hero set on saving the world and conquering an army of evil doers, no you’re basically just trying to make something of yourself or to simply survive in general.\n\nIn a world where combat is almost the last approach you should take to any given situation unless you wanna punish yourself constantly, as it’s very unforgiving. Even you have a good set of armor and you're decent with a weapon, chances are if you’re out numbered in this game, you'll still end up dead.\n\n\nBut is it any good? Let's find out.\n\nThe Good\n\nProbably my favorite thing about this game is easily the story and lore of it, but probably the best thing out of the story for me personally, was specifically the politics of this world and the factions surrounding it.\n\nAs I said earlier, you're not playing some sort of hero out to save the world, you're more or less just trying to make something out of yourself, and a lot of that will tie into the factions and politics of this world and whom you end up siding with.\n\nEach city is governed by it's own “House” each house is lead by someone out to either restore the old empire or simply just still exist or find out the questions of the gods of this world, then you've also the guilds such as the assassins, thieves, and the imperial army and such, so the game will throw plenty of different routes your way.\n\nAnd don't expect to be able to do quests for all of them at once, a lot of them are skill bound to certain things or based on your reputation with those houses, but at the same time it won't stop you from trying, so you can try and join the thieves guild as a terrible thief with no sneaking or stealing abilities, but chances are you'll reach a point where it's literally impossible to complete a quest or continue the game because of your skill set.\n\nIf you wanna experience everything Age of Decadence has to throw at you, you'll be in for a number of different playthroughs, the game is heavily based around replayability, choosing different routes and skill sets to experience numerous different routes in the campaign.\n\nMy next favorite thing about this game, also somewhat ties into the story a bit is the lack of a black and white morality system, you won't have your typical SAVE THE PUPPY or EAT THE PUPPY style of morality choices, honestly the game will punish you at times for even trying to be a decent person, if you plan on playing some like sort of mythic hero, most of the time you'll simply be taken advantage of for it.\n\nAs for the combat, as I've said it's really more or less one of the options you wanna avoid unless you're playing a character with the right skill set for it and even then it's still very punishing at times.\n\nThe game will throw plenty of moments your way where combat is seemingly impossible, but there are still ways to cheese your way through it, especially with alchemy, it will quickly become your best friend and I highly recommend learning it if you decide to play a very combat specific character.\n\nAs for the soundtrack side of things, the music is your typical kind of moody med-evil dramatic music, it's whatever and nothing too memorable.\n\nBut now let's discuss what we'd all rather forget...\n\nThe Bad\n\nNow to get the obvious out of the way, for a game released in 2015 this obviously doesn't look spectacular, it's definitely at this point a fairly dated looking game, from what I understand however it began it's development in the early 2000s so I guess that makes sense, but it obviously doesn't excuse the fact.\n\nEverything from the textures, the character models, the limited character customization and the animations, and over all even the art style I personally didn't find all that interesting, it's your standard med-evil / ancient empire sort of affair when it comes to the cities and some of the ruins you'll find, the only stand out thing to me were some of the temples you'll discover.\n\nBut honestly, graphics to me aren't exactly a major selling point for me on video games, so all this I still very minor stuff in my opinion.\n\nBut hey! Now you can play a new isometric turn based RPG and it'll even look familiar too... Right?\n\nAs for the technical aspects, my biggest issue is the stability of the game, I'm not sure if it was my capture software or what, but I had a ton of crashing issues with the game personally, but during my 35 to 40 or so hours I spent with it, other then the constant crashing the game remained bug free for me personally, so that's always a plus, just make sure to quick save a ton if you plan on playing this.\n\nThe only other issue I personally had with Age of Decadence is an issue I've had with almost every other major turn based isometric RPG is simply the combat at times can really drag out a long time when it comes to large scale combat with numerous people on screen,\n\nYou basically move forward and then the next two minutes is everyone else getting into position and moving forward, and then some, but thankfully it's pretty rare to get into a large combat scenario Age of Decadence, but when you do, it takes like 20 to 30 minutes to win a fight some times, but once again this is very minor stuff.\n\nHowever, probably still my biggest issue with the combat system itself, is the lack of an escape or flee option during combat, unlike let's say Fallout for example and you have a random encounter while traveling, you can simply escape combat or leave a combat scenario in most cases by more or less walking away to the edge of the area or leaving whatever area or settlement your in.\n\nHowever in The Age of Decadence, you basically can't leave or escape combat, so you ether die trying or hopefully win, but at times the game will throw you into a combat situation out of no where, that is almost impossible to win early on in the game and you'll have no choice but to reload an older save.\n\nBut with all that out of the way, it's time I give...\n\n\nThe Opinion\n\nAt the end of the day, Age of Decadence is a game that knows the audience it's aiming and intended for, however because of this I feel this game is definitely not for everyone.\n\nIf you aren't a fan of isometric turn based RPGs this game won't exactly change your opinion on them and graphically it's not exactly stellar,. but none the less I still had a ton of fun once I got deeper into the game.\n\nAdmittedly the barrier of entry for Age of Decadence is a big thick wall of death screens and walls of text, but if you can get past all this and actually enjoy what you're reading, Age of Decadence is still a fantastic game and I still highly recommend it if any of this interests you.\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","May 22","true","35.9"," 24 of 25 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","24","25","0","0"

I would comment on more, but as it stands, it is a perfect A in all categories BUT ONE—Saving/loading.

There was no save points in between, so I just fought the same two guards for quite some time and am now contemplating just reseting the whole save!\n\nALL I WANT (for channukah):\n\n+SAVING\n-Autosave\n-Able to save during text screens (unless there is already a way and I am just an idiot)\n\n+MORE\n-of this wonderful game!","November 30, 2013","true","12.4"," 53 of 75 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","53","75","0","1"

I remember reading about him about 9-10 years ago and since them I've waited for it to release. The game is set in a post apocalyptic roman empire like world and features turn based combat and lots of C&C.\n\nWhen starting the game you receive a warning that this game isn't some fantasy dragon killer simulator. When I first played the demo this year I died on the first quest, because I was stupid and tried to fight someone instead of running away. In this game, with a badly made build you can die easily. The thing that you have to remember though is that this is an Role Playing Game so that if you choose skills/stats related to the selected class (background) the game will be just fine to play. Sure, if you try to be greedy you will get killed if you are not prepared. This means that a change to the way you play this kind of games is required. Like a said above, a bad build is easily made if you don't think about the way a class is played. A merchant maybe should't get into fights and instead should try to talk his way out of problems or solve quests. Sure, you can try to spread into many skills but this may mean you will be unprepared for some future situations, so specialization I think is key. I would say this game is similar to Neo Scavanger on this part. In both games you have to think  about what you are going to do. Eating uncleaned water or trying to fight a soldier without having some weapon training could be deadly in both games.\n\nNow that the role playing part is described, I think I should write a bit about story. If you read any of the other reviews, you will know this game is full of C&C (Choice & Consequence). Many of the actions you will take will influence the events that you will received in the future and how you will be treated. Kill a guild trader and you may find that an assassin will be sent after you. Believe the words of a shady looking person and you will find yourself dead in a ditch. The C&C part is probably the reason this game took so long to make, since every background should be viable and also different from the others. What this means is that huge ammounts of text are in this game and it's a lot of (great) reading to be made. I don't think there is any game with so much C&C. The only game that has a smaller amount of C&C is maybe the Witcher series, but not even them don't have as many outcomes and ways to deal with situations. Now that I think a bit, maybe Fallout 2 is a bit similar to it. Both are post apocalyptic games, with turn based combat and many skills that unlock different ways to solve the problems. Similar to Fallout New Vegas there is also a reputation system which opens or closes the way you gain access to some quests.\n\nLike I said in the beginning, the combat is turn based, with different type of attacks available for each weapon. Each weapon class also has different uses and special attacks (eg. you can impale with the spear). If you played Fallout 1 or Fallout 2 is should be very similar. You use action points to move, to make attacks, use items (like poison), etc. Related to fight is also a crafting & alchemy mechanic which can be used to turn the balance on your favor in the harder fights. I think that the fights are well made, with enemies trying different tactics to kill you. What is important also to fighting is avoiding damage, which can be made in two ways: dodge or armor (you can't max both since armor decreases dodge chance).\n\nThis is a great game and I recommend it to any serious RPG fan. If you only played this kind of games recently, and didn't try older RPGs, this kind of game may seem harder to play but it really is not. It's a game that doesn't treat you like some brain-dead jellyfish. From my part, this should be the game of the year.\n\nTL; DR\nGame is great, lots of C&C with classes that play different and turn based combat. GOTY material, now go and buy a copy!","September 15, 2015","true","32.2"," 29 of 35 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","29","35","0","0"

No.  Does Age of Decadence feature a dense and branching storyline that is replayable, a skill system that further encourages replays and experiementation, NPCs with realistic and logical motivations, and and a dialogue system that is perhaps the most detailed and rewarding to be created in recent memory?  Yes to all of these and that is why Age of Decadence is truly a pack leader when it comes to cRPGs.  The width and breadth of this game is made all the more impressive when you look at how small the creative team is that developed it.

There is a LOT of replay here because you can miss huge sections of the game by your choices or simply being locked out because you couldn't do this fight, or couldn't talk your way past a certain person. Also it is easy to miss quests/items/interactions (no big glowing light on ! over the head :) you have to hunt for them and pay attention)\n\nHonestly after 40hours i feel the game was worth every penny, and i restarted about 5-6 times before finally settling on a dagger/dodge/crit/crafting (with some lore to try and see a bit more of the game)...\n\nI would suggest it highly to others, but i do kind of wish the one thing the game did to 'hold your hand' was HIGHLY suggest you stick to about 4 skills MAYBE 5 and build your stats around those skills 100% AND realize it is better to go 8-10 in a stat instead of trying to balance yourself across ALL the stats, also depending on the path you took to get to the end, it can be a kind of "wait.. WHAT? that was?? WHAT!?!?! ughhhhh" kind ending, i felt like on my 1st completion, it came out of no where, and i had no idea what i was doing or why i shuld choose X,Y,Z for the ending, but perhaps that is simply because of the choices i made with the assassins guild..\n\nThe one thing i think they could of perhaps done differently was the prestat classes you pick (which determine the first few minute sof the game) might of been nice if those had started in different towns, but would of been 'difficult' i suspect to balance out all the interactions then..\n\nalso the background story on this game is GREAT, TONS of lore and info you can dig around and find, quite a good version of "earth" they have come up with...","October 18, 2015","true","39.5"," 24 of 27 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","24","27","2","0"

If it comes to a fight the fight is justified and brutal.\n- The game is not too long, but it has lockouts. This means one playthrough will take around 8h, but you will not understand everything. Which is reasonable as a realistic character will never be fit to do everything. However the game encourages multiple playthroughs and this will not mean a few different choices, but it will mean visiting completely different locations meeting completely different people.\n- The story and lore are actually very good. At first it doesn't stand out too much. But I did three playthroughs now (Merchant / Loremaster / Assassin) and I apprechiate all the details that have been put into very much.\n- The combat system is quite balanced. The game has random number generation but in a lot of fights when I was dying raising a combat stat by one point usually made a big difference.\n\nA few negative points are to be mentioned as well. Most of them are expected when you purchase a game from a small indy studio which has a focus on story:\n- The graphics are not the best.\n- There is no voice acting.\n- A very small amount of things/people are actually animated.\n- The music is good, but gets repetitive.","May 8","true","49.0"," 24 of 27 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","24","27","0","0"

Lots of story content.\n\nYou know how in most modern RPGs the story is on rails? Sometimes those rails pass through scenic (Alpha Protocol) or even breathtaking (Mass Effect) story environments, and you don't really mind. Sometimes a few short rail tracks are scattered across the wasteland, and as long as wondering the wasteland is satisfying (Elder Scrolls) you don't really mind.\n\nYet Age of Decadence isn't about rails at all. The story is a freaking web; you get to choose your own path through it, jumping back and forth between multiple story lines at will, with consequences for the environment ranging from none at all to scorched earth.\n\n\n2. Satisfying combat (and not only combat).\n\nQuite a few turn-based games managed to bore me rather quickly due to repetitive and dull combat. Despite bowing to the effort put into Divinity: Original Sin, for instance, I just can't take another round of "buff-summon-summon-slash-slash-slash-heal-slash-slash-slash-heal..." for at least 3 turns each time a lowly wolf crosses my path - you can't quickly steamroll through non-challenging encounters because of the turn-based combat system, and those non-challenging encounters are everywhere.\n\nAge of Decadence never managed to bore with combat. Combat system offers a lot of tools and options, most encounters are unique (no hordes after hordes of generic thugs every 5 meters), plus combat is usually just one of the ways to solve a problem.\n\nNot in the mood for a fight with those thieves? Tell them how many you've killed and they'll kindly see themselves out of your way.\n\nHaving second thoughts about a brawl with gate guards? Well, if you know a thing or two about sneaking and have a dagger, some instant kills may be coming your way. Or bribe them. Or convince them you're an awkward scientist. Or a highborn. Or a travelling vendor. Or show them a peculiar signet ring. Or throw something at them. Or... Well, guess you're getting it by now.\n\nThat said, you can finish the game without having to fight once - or slaughter armies.\n\n3. Power armor.\n\nTo sum up: a brilliant RPG title definitely worthy of your time - and your support.","October 28, 2015","true","50.9"," 21 of 22 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","21","22","0","0"

No one I know owns this game except me. If you're a fan of the old school Fallout 1/2 series, this is definately a good successor to that kind of gameplay.\n\nVery few games nowadays have a lot of rich story, a conversational text dialog system,  and plenty of branching paths to choose from to shape your character. This is one of the few that keeps the classic roleplaying genre alive.\n\nThe only downside to this game is that the difficulty is just insane. It will take a lot of effort, research, and trial and error just to make some decent progress after countlessly dying and starting over to try new character builds. This, however, is also part of its charm because there really isn't any handholding at all. This is truly one of the real hardcore games that I haven't really seen in quite some time.

It's a game that forces you to deal with your character as a living being, not an omnipotent figure - an avatar capable of solving all the world's problems. If you try to play it like a conventional game, you will always die, and fast.\n\nNPCs lie to you - all the time.They try to sell you useless junk. They try to use you to destroy their enemies, putting you in horrible situations. Trying to be "fair and honest" doesn't guarantee that others will be, you will often be treated like garbage, or as an innocent fool. It's a crude path in a harsh world; completely different from current games. And any choices you made in your adventure completely change the plot of the game and its ending. It's a short game (you can complete it in less than 20 hours), but each playthrough will be completely different from the previous one.\n\nThe good:     An  extremely balanced turn-based combat system that requires you to deeply understand how it works.\nA unique post-apocalyptic setting inspired by the Roman Empire.\nNPCs to behave like human beings and not as generic characters, in a cunning and cruel world.\nChoices & consequences - every decision made in the game has a huge impact on the narrative.\nHuge replayability, as in, ridiculously massive.\nThe bad:     An extremely hostile game to beginners.\nYou're kind of forced to engage in one of the two paths in the game: your character will either be a fighter or a talker. A "jack of all trades but master of none", in this game, is basically suicide.\nThe "CYOA style" of the game sometimes makes you feel trapped, the skills don't interact organically with the game, they only "work" in scripted events.\nTL;DR: Even if it isn't perfect, it's a breath of fresh air.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ModernYankee/recommended/230070/","ModernYankee","Yankee(Now in Technicolor)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ModernYankee/","370 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI'll start by saying this:\nThis is easily one of the best RPGs I've ever played. I don't think there's another game out there that captured my interest so quick. But that doesn't tell you much. Let me elaborate.\n\nAge of Decadence is brutal. It's painful. It will kick you while you're down and do it again, and again, and again. Every situation you'll encounter in this game is either going to leave you in a life or death struggle or trying to piece together things you couldn't hope to understand, and that's a good thing. This is not like modern RPGs(i.e. the more recent incarnations of the Falllout Series, Elder Scrolls, Divinity, Underrail, etc) nor is it entirely like those of old(Fallout 1 & 2, Baldur's Gate, etc.). I am reminded of all, I see influences while playing it, but Decadence sticks out on its own. Again, I think it has to do with difficulty.\n\nDecadence hands nothing to you: you pick your character background, assign some basic Stats, and then pick a few skills to upgrade. Character creation leaves you tied to what you make--A strongman swordsman with wind blowing through his ears will still be dumber than a bag of rocks by the end of the game, a persuasive talker who has no combat prowess will consistently get shredded within moments of entering combat. What you make is what you get.\n\nTo put it another way, Decadence does not put you in the shoes of the hero. You can die in the first fight very, very easily( I have, multiple times), and I'm sure you will as well. You are very much an everyman, someone thrown into a world that can and will exist with or without you. The only time you're ever going to be anyone of status('Hero', 'Chosen One', 'Scourge of Humanity', 'Demi-god', etc.) is by putting enough people down at your feet through hard-scrabble fights and barely coming through alive. You have to live a legendary life before you can become a legend yourself.\n\nThereagain, that's assuming you choose to fight at all. This isn't necessarily a combat oriented game--you can talk your way out of things, trick, cheat and steal your way to success--Decadence encourages you, in a way, to avoid messy solutions. In fact, it'll often get you farther in terms of understanding the game world, story, the politics of the world Iron Tower has created and the people and creatures living in it. It'll also leave you cursing yourself as misallocated skill points cost you the opportunity to read that dillapidated scroll in an ancient library, or pull off negotiations with a feuding noble, or figure out a way to talk your way through a horde of angry tribals who want to throw you into a pit with an abomination from ages beyond. It's not any easier, certainly, the life of a silver-tongued devil compared to a battle-scarred warrior.\n\nSounds rather difficult, right? For people who have some kind of enjoyment of punishment and pain?\n\nThis game will teach you to enjoy failure. Half the fun will be trying again, in dealing with the failure. There are moments, certainly, where things get to be a little ridiculous(I wasn't very happy when I had to trash my first character partway through) but once you get into the game, things move quick. Trying again isn't so bad after you know what to do, how to maximize your effectiveness in the playstyle you shoot for. And sometimes, you'll just have to reload and try again, and hope the rolls are kinder to you, that your hits land this time and that four-armed monstrosity you're fighting stops landing criticals every hit for the past twenty loads in a row.\n\nFurthermore, it's very, very hard to make a decent jack-of-all-trades character, let alone an expert in everything. Honestly, it's hard to go purely for combat, or social skills, and so on.  It takes some maneuvering to get your skills where you need them when you need them. More often than not, you'll be reloading or restarting entirely, trying to find out the best order to do things, the best way to spend your points, the best options to choose in each situation so you don't hit a brick wall later on, finding out you literally cannot progress past a certain point because of errors in character building.\n\nGoing off the jack of all trades, to fully experience the game, you(probably) will have to make multiple characters. At the moment, I've got a mercenary/warrior character with some light social skills and a character who is built entirely around understanding the ancient history of the gameworld(there is actually a skill for this in game, called "lore", and it's rather useful) as well as persuasion and the like. I'm probably going to have to make another one, and one more, and so on to really get the full picture. You will too, and probably will want to. Each character has a very different story, a very different interaction with the world: you'll need quite a few to get a good picture of it all.\n\nSpeaking of the world, the "bigger picture": This game has some serious writing behind it. It, quite simply, turns your expectation from a possibly predicatable RPG storyline to feeling like your reading a novel that's just setting the stage for an entire series. There's a huge meta-plot going on beyond the actions of your character--the story becomes as much about the world your exploring and its history as it does about your character's journey through it and it left me craving more. In fact, I made that lore-based character I mentioned earlier solely for the the purpose of digging deeper into the realm presented. Like the inhabitants of the world of Age of Decadence, I wanted to find out more about the fantastic world they lived in, what happened to it, and how exactly it got to where it is now.\n\nAt the time of writing this review, the game is still in early access, and we're waiting on a big update to wrap up the exisiting questlines, locations and so on. So, be aware you might not be able finish the game right yet if you buy this in early 2015. However, there is so much content you won't get bored while waiting. Best of all, you can(probably) use your previous saves in future updates--barring any serious scripting errors that might arise in the future with updates and so on, older saves seem to be pretty compatible with new versions of the game.\n\nAll in all, I am very happy with my purchase(I've owned this game four or five days and already have 30-40 hours in it) and I can't recommend it more. Well worth the price.\n\nIf you have any doubts, try the demo first. It's there and is a good representation of the gameplay. Also, try reading the forums and asking around if you're not sure--the community is very friendly, as are the developers.\n\nTL;DR version:\n\nDo you like difficult, challenging  RPGs with great writing that encourage that force you to learn from your failed attempts and turns it into something enjoyable?\n\nThen buy it.\n\nOh, one last thing: Save like a madman! You're going to die soon.\n","December 31, 2014","true","79.6"," 44 of 62 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","44","62","0","1"

Well just popped back in for a bit, to see how the progression had come along. Totally new world.

Easy to use.\nCharacter Creation and advancement is a real treat. As you really need to think about who / what you are. They really got it right in the fact that you cannot be a Dragonslayer Knight Templar / Loremaster / Thief  all at once. You have to really think it thru'. Balance? Or be good at what I am.

Do not get me wrong, these are all there, and others will surely cover them in detail.\n\nI will mention 2 other points instead:\n\n- couple of years ago, fans of isometric RPGs with turn-based (or RTwP) combat, focused on writing and quest desing, had a tough time. Infinity engine games were no longer made, Fallout got turned into FPS, Black isle and Troika were no more.  Now, we enjoy a renaissance with games like Divinity:OS, Wasteland 2, Pillars of Eternity or new Torment. But it was AoD that was, at least for me, the first herald of incline. Even though it was overtaken by quicker development of other titles, devs from Iron Tower were first or among the first who believed that such games will still have audience. I hope we will prove them right.\n\n- how many of us would quit a steady job to follow an uncertain dream? We all hope we would; in the dev team this already happened, when some of them felt work on AoD can no longer be done part-time.\n\nRecommendation: Buy. Unless it is on sale, then wait till sale is over and buy for full price to better support devs in further game development.","October 14, 2015","true","3.6"," 28 of 35 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","28","35","0","0"

Some of them are known to the common men portraying themselves as harsh truths of the circumstances or a hopeful future...some of them are only known to people who seek things behind the illusionary curtain before our eyes. Age of Decadence makes you visit all these worlds at your leisure and with your style. Let us cut the fancy words and stab our knife deep into the meat of this game. What makes Age of Decadence, unique?\n\nAge of Decadence is set on a post-apocalyptic world devastated by a war between the Empire and Qantari. The war, its consequences and the remnants (ruins, devices etc) from those times creates the mystical side of the lore but on the other hand the numerous factions vying for the power adds to the mundane part of the lore. As your character progresses, depending on your actions, background and character prowess you will find yourself uncovering things let it be political schemes, marvellous devices or simply glory of combat in the battlefield. Thus having a tasty background, Age of Decadence gives us a solid sign that it is a candidate to become a classic.\n\nFirst of all, forget being a hero (though it is still possible) all the time since the game will allow you to back down from several dangerous situations...but once the die is cast...you'll have to live with its consequences. Depending on your character build (combat, non-combat, hybrid) you can find different kinds of solutions to a certain quest or mission. And mind you those different solutions may lead to different consequences. Your generosity towards a person may pay well later in the game or you might find yourself in difficult situations because some thugs marked you as a target due to your generosity. It is definitely a decadent world where you should READ and ASSESS the situation properly. If you do not notice the warning signs, understand the personality of the characters you are dealing with...you might find yourself in difficulty or pushing daisies.\n\nThe most striking part though...the cumulative effect the game presents you. From the start, you are subject to a different perspective on an assassination vignette where your background will affect it quite much. It will also make other NPCs of the starting town react differently. Such as, you might be the Assassin who is hired to kill the trader but perhaps you were the Mercenary whose duty was to protect the trader. Perhaps as a Mercenary you let the Assassin depart or avenged your employer and it may impress the Assassin's Guild (it is named as Boatmen of Styx and like every faction it has a neat backstory). Or you were merely a Drifter and heard some noises before stumbling upon the corpses of an assassin, a mercenary and a trader. I wouldn't want to spoil all vignettes here...regardless you will see from the start the game will offer you more depth into the matters.\n\nAnother striking point is the importance of factional relations. Don't expect to pay some sum to a shady man and magically all bad feelings are gone. Minor slights and such can be mended with some acts of goodwill...but if you screw some relations severely, you'll have to live with that and like every organization, Age of Decadence factions have enemies and allies in times of change. And even your personal allegiance can change at crucial times let it be for your personal gain, a change of ideals or merely you wish for some thrill. Choices and living up to their consequences...is the essence of this game.\n\nCombat system is Action Point based where people should be familiar from Fallout series...This is one part I don't wish to go into detail because the game itself has a nice training mode where a starter player can try different types of weapons in order to get a hold of mechanics. As I said, don't be a hero and try this training :D\n\nAs one last positive, the demo of the game has the entire first chapter of the game with all its vignettes. You will not regret trying it out and will keep wanting more of it. I know I did and still do. I shall update the review for the future versions.","August 1, 2014","true","37.2"," 38 of 53 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","38","53","0","0"

Depends on your background and your build of your character there are many things you are not able to do, for example if you are not a fighter(or you are a fighter but not the best),if you wanna do something like help people from raiders(or you want to rob people), you will find the figher is impossible,usually you end up dead, but you can find other solutions like diplomacy,sneak to your objectives,steal it,and sneak out.","October 14, 2015","true","63.2"," 24 of 29 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","24","29","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/faction60/recommended/230070/","faction60","happy birthday to me","http://steamcommunity.com/id/faction60/","131 products in account","There's many disappointing things about this game. It's been in development for a long time, and most of those development hours clearly went into raw amounts of content (this is being generous, there really isn't much content) and lots of mediocre writing rather than improving the general experience. I wouldn't be surprised if a fair bit also went into begging for positive reviews and downvotes on any negative reviews - there is no way this game warrants an 88% positive rating otherwise.\n\nPros:\n-Semi-interesting setting, acceptable writing, lots of reading if you feel like it - but there are much, much better works you could be reading instead.\n\n-You get to play an isometric RPG as a single character rather than a party, which is uncommon.\n\nCons:\n-Advertised as "hardcore," but really, the game is extremely simple at its core. Tedium is NOT difficulty. Dying a lot doesn't make the game "hard," either. Yes, you'll die a lot in Age of Decadence, but it's not like, say, Dark Souls, where you can outplay your death. You just reload and click the other option in AOD; nothing about this game requires much thought and it certainly doesn't test your skill, ever, at any point. Allow me to elaborate:\nFor a non combat character, you essentially just click choices in a dialogue. For you, that's the game - it's like a tedious visual novel. You also have to keep old saves and save your skillpoints, because you need to level up the correct skills to pass dialogue checks, otherwise you can't progress. You will get lots of game overs as a non-combat character just because you invested your points into the wrong skill, whereas a combat character always has the (realistic) option to muscle their way through any situation the game might present. It's a bit disingenious that the creators say that combat is the hardest way to win the game; you'll probably reload LESS as a properly built combat character than you would a non-combat character.\n\n-Combat is extremely simple, and is mostly RNG based. You mostly spend your Action Points in the most damaging way possible, then move as far as you can to force your opponents to spend additional AP travelling to you on their turn, so they get less attacks. You'll beat the game just fine taking the violent option in basically every situation, as long as you keep your equipment and attributes updated appropriately, and you won't break a sweat doing it. It's heavily random, though, so you might have to reload some fights until your attacks actually connect. But all in all, both combat AND dialogue in this game are really, really simple.\n\n-All combat is set pieces. There's no random encounters, roaming enemies, or anything like that. Every battle is a pre-made set piece that comes behind a loading screen.\n\n-NO EXPLORATION. You get to places by clicking on the map. That's it. There's no roaming the plains and discovering things yourself, nothing like that. How shallow. In the few situations where you might find something interesting, instead of exploring itself, you're usually going to be clicking through a couple of dialogue screens that explain what your surroundings are like, etc.. Hey, how about you SHOW IT TO US instead?? Too much effort?\n\n-Each location hub is heavily lacking in content. You should finish Teron in about 30-45 minutes once you know your way around, Maaadoran is the same. You'll run around thinking "surely, there's something more to do here?" mousing over every NPC you see hoping they are interactable, only to find that no, there isn't. Those npcs are just scenery.\n\n\n-Every second bit of dialogue will be full of swearing. Not that this offends me, but really, writer: there are other, less obnoxious ways to emphasize that your setting is "gritty." The overuse of profanity is just hamfisted and lazy.\n\n-Game looks like crap. I'm no graphics nut, and I'm well aware of what the devs are going for, but that's just an excuse. Visuals are an afterthought in this game, and it's not good enough that the package as a whole can make me ignore that. Compare the look and feel of AOD to other new isometric games like Project Eternity. There's no comparison.\n\nIf you're an oldschool RPG fan, I advise you to stay away unless you've played every other oldschool RPG and you're just desperate for another. This game isn't for you, I'm not sure who it's for, really. The only ways to really enjoy are:\n\n1-Treat it like a choose your own adventure game where you have to reload your last save every 2 minutes, and save every 30 seconds, or\n2-Just make a completely OP combat character and put up with the extremely random, simple, tedious and boring combat so that you can experience the story.\n\nBut the story, even on its own, isn't anything special - so why would you suffer through a bad game just to read it?\n\nThis game should have been a mostly ignored e-book on Amazon. The only reason it's getting any attention at all is because it shoved itself into a genre it doesn't deserve to be a part of. I hesitate to call it a game, let alone a "hardcore old-school RPG."","October 15, 2015","false","19.5"," 199 of 336 people (59%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","59","199","336","7","38"

This RPG requires a massive commitment from the player. It requires reading, thinking, patience. You may have to refer to the forums (not the Steam forums but the actual\ndeveloper’s forums[www.irontowerstudio.com], out there in the wild!) If you choose the way of combat, you may be forced into the fields of strategy and math. No one is going to hold your hand. In fact, you had best keep it under your cloak or it may be chopped off.\n\nThe commitment is huge, yet somehow the payoff is bigger still. You will instigate cruel betrayals and double-crosses among competing, bloodthirsty factions. Study lore that doesn’t remind you of Baldur’s Gate or Dragon Age or George Martin or Tolkien. Engage in utterly unforgiving combat where success isn’t dropped like a bonbon into your hand. You are about to enter a world without filler, a land where every victory is earned.\n\nNo other game has the setting, challenges, or wealth of handcrafted content this one does.

When you die probably close to 20-30 times in a single encounter, several times when the last enemy left- and, sometimes, a single extremely powerful enemy- is basically hobbling on their patellas because everything below that has been turned into a thick, chunky mash, was it worth it when you finally win, 2 HP left but knowing that you'll wind up in the same situation again later?\n\nWas it worth it, basically knowing that most of your choices in this game, no spoiler, involve ♥♥♥♥ing someone somewhere over in the worst and most permanent ways imaginable? Was it worth it? To be honest, I can't speak for many other people, but to me, I think it was.\n\nThe game might be unfair, yes, brutally so. But eventually you get into the mindset of "losing is actually kinda fun", you start trying out new things to see what works instead of getting ♥♥♥♥♥♥ because you had to restart again. This is the kind of game where you're honestly expected to do that, and it's designed so that there's enough variety in how things work, and when, that even as restrictive as it sometimes feels I wind up WANTING to try out new things to see what works.\n\nIt's the kind of game that, sure, literally everyone in it I've seen so far is about as sympathetic as a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ cockroach with swastikas engraved on it's brains, including the player character, but the lore and writing are good enough that, by God, I'm actually keen on playing it to the end- once it's finished, of course- just because I'm interested to see what's gonna happen.\n\nThis is ultimately where "Is it worth it" really comes into play. It's a brutal, often frustrating game. If you ♥♥♥♥ up, you're going to die, whether it's in combat or in how you allocated points for story encounters, and the game seems about as non-chalant about it as a US president swatting a fly on TV. This is not Dark Souls, tired as that comparison is, because even that game seemed to wanna give you a chance at times. But if a game where ♥♥♥♥, EVENTUALLY, comes together, where you EVENTUALLY get it and EVENTUALLY you make it through sounds appealing, I'd say give it a shot. At least the demo, since, you know, there's a demo. For once with a game.\n\n♥♥♥♥, that's enough reason for me to wanna give it a recommendation.","December 19, 2014","true","45.3"," 34 of 48 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","34","48","0","0"

I found the combat to be quite fun, and a step up from other single character turn based combat games, because of the different weapon types and attack type you could use. Yet it was not as good as most party based games because of the lack of variety in the tactics you can use during battles in Age of Decadence.\n\nThe Age of Decadence is very hard, and much like classic crpgs, I had to start over after realizing my character build wouldn't cut it. Luckily this was a fun and painless experience because characters with different skills and attributes really do seem to play differently in Age of Decadence. Plus, the game is designed so that a lot of tedious things like walking to and fro can be skipped entirely through liberal use of fast travel, which I appreciated immensely when I played it.","October 15, 2015","true","9.1"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","16","18","0","0"

To save time on trying to review every point good or bad let me sum up what to do and what not to do....\n1. Do not treat this game like any conventional rpg like Balder's Gate... It wll not work.\n2. Do not try to multiclass your profession(jack of trades master of none) it will not work in the end. But major in a class 85% full spec to 15% rationed in a minor( I recommend that other minor to be "Lore" skill since you will need it to understand the strange things in the world.\n3, Choose your "Starting Attributes" wisely... Many encounters which are "set" in game will require "attribute checks"(I do not mean "skills  checks) and if for an example you are a warrior and have very poor strength...then dont think you are gona do well in battles swinging that huge Axe..or move that heavy object...If you are a warrior think like one....Spec your character... like one..."Attribute" gains are very very rare...and temporary even in items...\n4. Finally...and this is the most important......Save often Before every encounter and Never spend all of your gained "skill" points right away on skills...Pool them till you know you need them in certain encounters to over come a skill check...Sure you could youtube or google every encounter to figure what you need par se to over come every encounter but...whats the fun in that unless you are stuck.\n\nThink of this game like a story driven "choice selection dialog" that success is determined not just by your choices but your selected starting attributes and skill selection scores that will ultimately lead your character to a finality in a chain of selected outcomes...wether or not you "succeed" or "fail" at your selections ...unless its combat...which is win or loose...but the game IS NOT focused on combat...(which is turned based).\n\nThe game has great replay quality because each class can have different outcomes and the story npcs react differently to each class and choice rewards can vary...\n\nEdit: Never use your Whetestones/Poison Herbs/Healing Salves Unless you must for an encounter...they are very limitted and rarely ever respawns at vendors...use inns and healers to heal your character and buff weapons during hard to pass boss fights only...","October 20, 2015","true","137.4"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","85","17","20","3","0"

You are just one man who lives or arrived in the small town of Teron. The game starts you out as one of eight different backgrounds. These can be:\n\nPreator: A member of the nobility. What more can be said ?\nLoremaster: A learned master in the pre-apocalyptic matters, and there's a lot more to learn\nAssassin: The guild of assassins is a reputable guild in this world and you can be part of them\nMercenary: As a mercenary, you normally take whatever people throw at you\nThief: The Thieves' guild has managed to carve out a little empire for themselves.\nMerchant: As a merchant, you may alter the course of history\nGrifter: Grifters tend to con people out of money.\nDrifter: You just came to Teron with the clothes on your back. No one knows you, and no one cares.\nCharacter creationYou start out by creating your character in the game. You do this by allocating attribute and skill points and no matter what your chosen background is, you may distribute these points however you want.\n\nNote that being a Jack of All Trades and a Master of None is very difficult to play in this game.\nFocus on a few skills and this will help you out.\n\nSince there are almost 20 skills to choose from, you will notice that it might not be good to just put one point into each of them.\n\nGameplayThe game plays out on what I would call an isometric view of yourself. (Techy people say it's better to say bird's eye-view)\nYou control your character using the mouse and most actions are mouse based. The game is text-heavy and will require to read a lot. Luckily, the text and story are well-written and very interestingly, all of the stories interweave into one.\nSo playing as one background will feel very different than playing as another. This is the main selling point of this game.\nNo single playthrough will be the same due to so many different ways of completing quests.\n\nCombat is turn-based and requires a lot of planning and investment, so do not think your highly intelligent and charismatic loremaster with zero combat skills will be able to win any fight in this game.\nCombat includes such things as aimed attacks, nets, bolas, fire bombs and more. These should all be used if you want to win fights in this game.\n\nConclusionFor me the major selling point of this game is all of the interweaving story arcs. I have played the game as both a Merchant and a Mercenary and the game played out completely differently based on my actions.\n\nI would recommend this game to anyone who likes turn-based combat systems and good stories and who is not afraid of challenges.\n\nI would not recommend this game to people who dislike turn-based combat systems, reading or are too much into graphics to enjoy older-looking games.\n\nPros:\nAmazing writing\nLots of interweaving stories and arcs\nChallenging combat: with old style aimed attacks a la Fallout\nLots of different skills and attributes affecting almost all questlines\nInteresting guilds and backgrounds to choose fromCons:\nOld-looking graphics\nSome feelings of being gated sometimes due to missing just one skill point (not enough to not continue the game, but enough to feel a bit annoyed :D)","October 7, 2015","true","91.2"," 18 of 22 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","18","22","0","4"

Not for the graphics, but for almost everything else. Finally a game where your choices matter. It is not a game that tells you your choices matter - only to later show you that the only thing that matters about them is one mission that's marginally different.\n\nIn Age of Decadence your choices will define you AND the empire at large. You can bring down whole families or guilds, you can isntall an emperor. You can betray your closest friends and allies, or side with your enemies in a spur-of-the moment decision. These betrayals will have an impact on everyones life, and your own - normally the termination of your own unless you're aptly prepared.\n\nAnd all of this while being a very mortal character. Did I mention you're very mortal? No longer can you wade through a horde and come away unscathed, instead you end up dying in a back alley to a pair of muggers. This is a game where  you're not only told you matter, but you can see just how you matter in the changing landscape of the world.\n\nAll this being said it's probably not a game for everyone, but if you love a story that actually ties you into it (did I mention that the main storylines of every class intertwine at different points throughout the game?) then this game may be for you.","October 23, 2015","true","27.9"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","14","15","0","0"

It presents a postapocalyptic world in the past, low magic married with technology and many different main story arcs of different spirit: fighting, deceiving, assassinting, thieving, learning.\n\nI would say that this game leans more towards a RPS, that is a role playing simulation.  It asks you to act rationally, rather than epically. If for instance you choose the path of a warrior, in the start of the game you are simply a mediocore character that knows how to handle a weapon so so. This means that if you are getting into a fight with a thug that you see in the street, you better have some strategy or some plan on how to beat that guy. Otherwise if you just charge on and start slashing at him/her, chances are you will probably die. For this reason the game offers you a wealth of strategies very specific to each class of weapon that you choose. Weapons are no longer about damages and resistances but is about strategies. While directly slashing at a legionnaire with a dagger feels like chipping a wall, if you use the correct strategy and if you are skillful enough then you simply open him up like a can of tuna fish. And also for this reason the game does not randomly throw enemies on your feet. Every enemy you meet have some reason why they are there. They are not like a random encounter, it is you who is more like a random encounter for them. So yes, the game asks you to behave as you would in a real life situation but in a fantastic setting. If you were really a fighter skilled in using a dagger, you must use every bit of your skill in order to survive against an opponent who is a seasoned fighter, otherwise you will die. You must fight like you mean it, not you click it. And combat is of course by no means the only option. This game deserves the title role playing simulation because you can literally finish the game with 0 combat with only speaking your way around, by deceveing or persuading people, by impersonating people, by intimidating people, by forging documents. There are more than atleast 4 different story lines which you can follow, be it a fighting path, an assasinating path, a persuading path, a burglary path or learning the secrets of universe path. In this aspect this game is quite akin to Nox with the exception that it has more than 2 possible different paths that you can choose to finish the game.\n\nIt is an ambitious project, quite unique. It is first of its kind in a very long time. With a larger dev team, this game could have been easily the best game of the last decade. But due to time limitations, I think the devs could not give the desired amount of attention to each quest line. The only thing that feels unsatisfactory is the length of the game, it definitely leaves you desiring for more and it definitely could have been much longer had the devs had the right resources. But this game shows that what people would deem as impossible, is indeed possible. And should be pursued.  It is quite a refreshment from the late trend of making games that is guaranteed to never challange the mental capacity of the player. I hope the devs of this game expand their team even more with like minded individuals and makes game on an even grander scale so that my children don't have to suffer games made for morons.

The combat system is turn-based and hard hitting, turning into a blast once you get a hang of the system. Though, combat can be brutal... luckily, thanks to the wonderful development of the game, every instance of combat can be avoided. Which is very refreshing in the RPG world.\n\nIt's clear the people who made the game care about it and put a lot of effort in it, with the world being highly believable and character's dialogue on point. The world and lore is wonderfully portrayed and something that was new for me. The story, characters, and places are surprisingly memorable, and though the graphics are dated, I enjoy them immensely. They're nostalgic of older RPGs and the style itself is pretty. The way the game does dialogues is well done, with the abilities and skills coming in handy and the little box that pops up when talking having a certain amount of charm. As for sound, the soundtrack is great, with beautiful tracks to go with towns and exploring, and epic ones for the right moments.

Having watched a few videos and reading about it I was feeling mixed about picking it up - something about the combat seemed less than fluid, but I like to support indie devs as I'm usually enjoy these games than AAA titles.\n\nStarted the tutorial getting used to combat and found it to be quite intuitive - having played Fallout 1/2 many times I loved having aimed attacks.  Shortly after I started a new game as what I read was an easier combination - mercenary/pure fighter.  I restarted that role several times and I noticed depending on stats/skills I would discover secrets, and have new dialogue options each time which was great.\n\nAt this point I've put 2.5 hours into the game, died and restarted ~7 times trying out a wide variety of play-styles and classes and have seen just how different the very first part of the game can be based off background, stats, and skills.  Dialogue is top notch and the lore is also very interesting.\n\nThe gameworld itself is also very dark - without spoiling anything I was told to kill a mark but let the gentler side of me try and help only to be backstabbed and killed.  Playing a goody-two shoes so far hasn't worked out for me (even a good-half shoes :)).\n\nAs all the reviews say though, this game is not easy at all - fighting one-on-one is challenging enough initially, 2 or more is usually a death sentence.\n\nHighly recommended","October 23, 2015","true","56.0"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","0"

At least when comparing to games like Baldur's Gate 1 & 2, Icewind Dale, etc. which are often mentioned as said "old-school RPG". This game is called "hard" by many people, but I don't think this describes it properly either.\n\nFirst and foremost it is a game set in an apocalyptic, fall-of-the-Roman-Empire inspired low fantasy setting. In such a dystopian world human lives don't matter much to most people - except, of course, their own ones. This is the atmosphere you should expect when entering this game: Most people are unhelpful, will try to cheat you and use you for their own selfish purposes, and in such cases the game rewards a character dedicated to specific skills of two categories: either "civil" or "combat". For example, when you meet a friendly guy who wants to show you something 'at his house', your "Streetwise" skill (if it is high enough) will kick in, and tell you that something isn't right. This will give you an extra dialog option to leave or at least ask an inquisitive question. You can also be a thief, who breaks into peoples homes to steal their valuables, but just make sure that you have the required skills - a sneak skill will allow you to stay unnoticed, but it will not unlock doors or prevent your untimely death by a trap. Finally, if you decide to resort to violence you have a plethora of options to choose from: axes, daggers, crossbows, throwing weapons, spears, swords, hammers, nets, bows etc. all with different versions (for example some axes are huge 2handed with a ton of damage, but a slow speed and little defense, while others will allow you a shield for protection). As if the weapon skills weren't enough you also have the option of choosing different types of defense: Block (with a shield), dodge, and armor, all which can be viable with the right build. Also there is a critical strike skill, which not only works in combat, but also sometimes to quickly end a life without resorting to the fighting part. Above all these skills there are basic attributes, which you only predefine at character creation, but these are also very important in determining your character's strengths (if any) and weaknesses. They are: Strength, Dexterity, Perception, Intelligence and Charisma. Oh, and I forgot to mention that all combat is turn based, while dialog is limited by a certain amount of choices. The "adventure" part of the game is in real time, but as soon as you run into an "event" dialog will be initiated, this still allows you to look ahead at those 5 big guys with axes and hammers and think "Hmmm... I won't go down that road".\n\nNow I started by saying that "hard" isn't a proper word for descriping the game and here is why. While the game will end your life at any point if you don't pay attention to what you are doing, you can also be rewarded if you DO pay attention. Remember to specialize in only a few skills, because a "swashbuckler" all-rounder character is simply not very viable unless you meta-game a lot and have a lot of experience with the game. This is a more realistic experience given the setting than most RPGs which leaves you half-asleep while rushing through enemies and dialogs and even the "ultimate" endboss.\n\nWhile I consider this game great already, it is still in Early access and this also means a few flaws:\nThe ability to predict and avoid life threating situations is generally well established (as with the guy who wanted to show you his house-example as written above). However, in a few places something just happens with too few skill options to counter leaving only a very meta-gamed style possible for success in such encounters. Here is a (non-game) example just for illustration: Encounter requires for 1. step 6 crafting skill to succeed, next step will require 3 alchemy or 7 strength, then next one will require 6 intelligence and 5 persuasion. As you can see, these skill checks are sometimes very diverse, but require a very narrowly defined criteria to succeed, and there are rarely any "partial success" or "at least I got out alive" alternatives. This is the second part that people call "hard" but I think it goes in the category "Work in Progress" which this game still is.\n\nOverall it is a good early access game, which is forming up to be a very good finished game. Thanks developers!","January 19, 2015","true","91.2"," 30 of 45 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","30","45","0","0"

And theres no indication on if you should do heavy, medium or light attack meaning if your gona hit or miss feels like a roll of the dice.. This game probedly is skillfull and I just suck but so far I feel like its RNG and completly luck based in combat.. On the other hand you can use your skills in the text scenarios.. Like use Critical strike to insta kill someone before a fight begun.. Or impersonate + sneak to get inside unoticed.. Allot to experiment around with.. I played assassin.. I enjoyed myself allot.. Still feel there must be made some changes to the combat.. Everyone keep telling me its Trial and error and should be so.. But If i have to die 5 times every encounter.. Then I can say already this game will become very tedious and frustrating.. As in games like darksouls where you could if you where good win fights in your first try.. here it feels like you must go in.. Get completly ♥♥♥♥ed.. Go back to a save before.. Go and Rearm up on cheap poison, net and necesary stuff to even have a chance.. And many times that wont help as you dont got enough AP ( action points ) to attack and use thos items..

You'll need to save a lot, and invest your skill points wisely (a simple tip for the beginners is to specialize and go either full talker or full fighter, hybrid characters are more difficult to manage and require more knowledge of the systems to be played effectively).\nIt's definetely not a game for people who thought Dragon Age: Origins to be too hardcore for their tastes, nor for people who want to play the hero and defeat evil.\nNonetheless, it's a unique and very well-crafted game that brings some fresh air on the rpg scene, and deserves to be played by anyone who is willing to try a thematically mature and challenging game, and play one of the best recent rpgs. It comes with a demo, so you can also download it and see for yourself if it's your kind of game.","May 13","true","74.0"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","2"

I was thoroughly satisfied with my gameplay experience.\n\nIf you like post-apocalyptic settings, turn-based combat, exploring open worlds, dialogue trees, immersive role-playing, and gritty storylines, then you will really enjoy this game. The game takes place in a world where magic and science are relics of the past, and the current populace has resorted to medieval-age weaponry and equipment.\n\nThe aesthetics are very good – the amount of detail in the character models and environment is high. Equipping different weapons and armor will change the appearance of your characters – a rather simple feature I love seeing in any game. The sound effects and music are good and add to the hardcore, post-apocalyptic atmosphere. The story is great and each character starts of a bit differently (a la Dragon Age: Origins). I really like how each person you can play as offers a different perspective of the overarching story. For example, if you roll (create) a mercenary, you will be tasked with protecting a merchant – who later gets assassinated. If you roll an assassin, you will be the person doing the dark deed. Decisions are far-reaching in Age of Decadence (AoD), and new missions can open/close as a result of your actions. One of the game’s critical strengths is brutal realism – if you try battling in a 1 versus anything-more-than-1 match, you will most likely die. The game is unforgiving in its realism.\n\nControls are easy to learn and typical of turn-based strategy games. The tutorials are very helpful and each element of the game (there are many) are explained in detail. The learning curve is minimal to moderate depending on your experience with turn-based strategy game – the most challenging part of AoD is accepting that you will never be a godlike character, and trying to fight an army by yourself will result in your demise.\n\nGameplay begins with you creating a character, and the role (merchant, assassin, thief) determines your main mission and reputation with the numerous factions in the world. Next, you will be introduced to a set of tutorial missions that will quickly get you accustomed to many relevant mechanics that you will be using to progress. The game emphasizes that you do not always have to resort to violence, and a bit of guile and willpower can help you complete events without bloodshed; many of the side opportunities that result in combat are extremely difficult.\n\nDuring combat, everything is turn-based, with higher initiative characters moving first – this is why trying to take on a gang by yourself can be near suicide. You can try to move/attack during your turn, and the artificial intelligence (AI) is proficient enough to use advancedtactics against you – like closing the distance if you are a ranged fighter, flanking/surrounding you, and trapping you in place with nets. Fortunately, combat is not the main lure of AoD, as plenty of dialogue events have more depth if you have the associated skills (like being able to bluff your way – with disguise and persuasion – into an enemy camp).\n\nOverall, the gameplay and story are interesting enough to keep you entertained, especially if you are a lover of branching storylines and turn-based strategy in a post-apocalyptic setting. The game is worth trying for both veterans and new people to the genre.\n\nHighly recommend!\n\nCheers,\nDJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews\n\nMy Website[theroguereviews.com]","January 3","true","15.0"," 16 of 21 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","16","21","0","2"

I started playing cRPGs with the original Baldur's Gate and Fallout, I loved Planescape: Torment, and I feel this is on par with those classics.\n\nSome have said this game is for power gamer's, you could play it that way if you want, or you could deal with that fact that your character is a simple mortal and can't solve everything, can't pass every skill check, and deal with the cards you are dealt, play to your strengths and avoid your weaknesses, because you can still cross the finish line with an intelligent merchant as well as a badass assassin, just that your merchant isn't going to have much of a chance to become the champion of the arena. That said, its still a difficult game, especially if you are used to newer games, but I found the challenge never too difficult, but that's just me.\n\nPlaying through with multiple characters gives you a greater appreciation for the game as certain quests and allegiance to certain factions (who give you quests) can and will be restriced by your starting class, but feel free to change allegiances, in my favorite playthrough I was an assassin who betrayed my guild to rise in the ranks of the Imperial Guard. Each class comes with a preffered certain skill set, each has their own unique starting point and initial quests, and each will give you a better picture of the over-arcing story and how all of the pieces fit together, but each characters story is still complete in and of itself.\n\nIf you want an original story that builds off of great successes of old cRPGs and brings something new packaged with an old school challenging difficulty, this is it. There's no trite fantasy cliches here, no paladins, elves, dwarves, orcs, halflings or any other trapings of rehashed uninspiried D&D. if that's what you want look elsewhere, for here there is just men and women in a struggle to survive amidst a grim unique setting with an old world Roman flare. No spells getting tossed around like bathwater, just grounded, interesting, and brutal combat, with some excellent writing, interesting choices, and gritty combat. 10/10.","September 24, 2015","true","260.0"," 17 of 23 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","17","23","0","0"

The characters and the plots & schemes impressed me with their depth; The game's combat is great too, once you get the hang of it :) it kind of reminded me a bit of Fallout 2 but there are a TON of different variables to work with here so don't hover too much on this aspect.

Try it with different backgrounds to see the story from a different angle. The story will also change, as your actions on behalf of your faction will change the story. Excellent replayability.\nSeveral possible endings, and also a bit of a small "ending recap" outlining the results of your actions (or inactions) when you move to the next main area.\n\nThe setting's fairly gritty, society and technology has taken a dozen steps back after some disaster in the past, and is slowly recovering. The setting is medieval-ish with heavy influence from ancient rome. One part of the plot is figuring out just what occured during that cataclysmic event, as records of that time is largely lost into myth.\n\nThis is a fun turn based rpg in isometric view,  some may complain about the graphics, but its not the type of game that desperately needs the glossy eye-candy. It's challenging, it doesnt hold your hand, but it isnt unfair either.\n\nI recommend this to fans of the good old isometric crpg classics.

Uncovering all of the mysteries and learning about the pasts mistakes and current choices that are available to take advantage of and determine the future of the wasteland is a very exciting process as I seemingly cannot get enough of the dialogue, until the game runs out of it.\n\nI definitely recommend it for writing/lore reasons since that is my favourite aspect of the game, however if you're looking for a big challenge in a post-apolyptic turn based game, I still 100% recommend it.\n\nYou will not be disappointed.","October 23, 2015","true","20.5"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

If i had to describe it in three words, I'd say that it is "Roman Empire Fallout".\n\nPros:\n- Interesting and uncommon setting.\n- Lots of options to approach most of the quests.\n- Rather nonlinear story progression.\n- Brutal combat.\n- World full of selfish аsshоlеs. You can be one of them and con other аsshоlеs.\n\nCons:\n- Rather short. Probably inevitable, considering the small dev team and lots of branches, but still it saddens me.\n- Vast majority of non-combat interactions happen purely inside dialogue windows. Sometimes it plays more like a VN than an RPG.\n- Skillchecks, skillchecks, skillchecks. The success of most interactions relies purely on my character's stats and not on the OOC choice of words. Maybe that's a feature.\n- World full of selfish аsshоlеs. I've met at best three named NPCs whose fate I gave any damn about.

Nothing is marked with this game, which, in my opinion, is fine for everything other than quest givers. The game's art style makes everything easy to miss, so at some point it changes into pixel hount (which is still fine by me, as long as I know what I'm supposed to be doing, and if I haven't found the quest giver - I don't).\n2. I played a greedy merchant who nearly single handedly took over three locations for his guild and found an omniscient being.

It is a bit challenging at first, and it can be frustrating. Here's why\n\n1 ) You'll find yourself having to accept decisions that you otherwise don't like (because the alternative is getting killed.) For example, you can try to kill someone, but his guards will immediately attack you. Or you pay someone 1 000 coins or die (usually you can avoid this altogether, but that's based on your char's skillpoints)\n2) Combat is specifically made so you can't run straight towards 5 mobs and mercilessly slaughter them. Remember how the guards in Morrowind used to be? They would mow you down (until mid-late game when you'd kill them and sell their equipment for heaps of cash)\n3) No real quest log, or hints. You'll have to actually read the dialogues to get a sense of where to go and what to do. The quests have names, and a line or two of the stage you're at.\n4) The Wiki page is a bit empty, so finding hints online is a bit difficult.\n\nThe game however is extremely immersive, and once you get into the rhythm, highly addictive. The game may appear linear, as it is the same progression to cities, but when I say "no two play throughs are the same" I mean they won't be the same. They may be similar, but time has clearly been spent by the devs to make sure one decision has tangible effects. The story line is unique, the environment is engaging, and the characters have depth.\n\nSo in sum:\nIf you're looking for a game that demands your attention and total engagement, as well as being crucifyingly realistic, buy this game\nIf you're looking for a laid back game, skip this one. Think Morrowind; no map markers, no clear indicators where to go.\n\nYou're told "Don't go into the Slums of Maadoran." In this game, that's actual advice. You will die, or get robbed blind.","October 19, 2015","true","15.5"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

It has its rough edges - the graphics look at least a decade out of date, and it is not intended to offer a balanced experience: but it also offers the most distinctive RPG experience currently available.\n\nThe setting eschews the typical pseudo-medieval fantasy for something akin to post-Roman Europe: the last vestiges of civilisation hanging on after the collapse of their infrastructure, power-struggles and political machinations rife among the surviving city-states, propsectors scavenge old ruins for the remains of better time and everyone else does exactly what it takes to stay alive. The nearest analogy I can think of would be Dark Sun.\n\nCharacter creation is also distinctive - you can be a warrior, a thief or an assassin: or a politician, a mercenary, a historian, a con artist or a drifter. You have both combat skills (dodging, blocking and the various weapons) and civil skills (sneaking, stealing, lockpicking, persuasion, crafting, alchemy, Lore, impersonation...). The skills are many, no character can maximise all (or even many) of them, and they have a huge impact on your experience of the world.\n\nCombat is brutal  and unforgiving - but also deep and highly tactical. A good Alchemist can craft bombs and poisons that will make a huge difference to the way a fight goes. You need to select between rapid and weak shots, through to slower but more powerful shots according to an enemy's armour and mobility. You can't win every fight.\n\nThe key thing to recognise with this game is that you're not playing a world-changing hero: you're crafting the story of a particular individual, and it won't necessarily end well. There are points where you make momentous decisions that change the course of the world - but there are also points where you are buffeted by forces you can't control because you don't have the skills you need, and it's important to recognise that in order to see everything the game has to offer you will have to play through with several, very different characters. You're guaranteed to reach some dead ends, and points where if you send your character up for the choice you want, they'll just get killed - and it all depends upon your build.\n\nMy first character was an Assassin, set to sneak, steal and blag his way through the game - armed with a bow, and dependent on incendiaries for crowd management and poison for maximum effect. I struggled at the end of the first city, unable to complete the "boss fights" on offer, and it took me a while of frustrating repeat playthroughs thinking "This is so unfair! How am I meant to do this?" before realising I wasn't. I didn't have to beat the fight to progress - only if I wanted a particular outcome. Other characters might have been able to do this, but they wouldn't have had the same options as me, and in the end I just legged it to the next city. I didn't get the outcome I wanted, but that's very much how this game works: you make the most of the situations presented to you. My assassin got close to end game, before finally running out of steam - skills too thinly spread to make progress (not combat enough to fight through, not persuasuive enough to talk through). So that was that.\n\nMy second character was a Loremaster (historian), who specialise almost entirely in history, crafting and persuasion, and completed the game's storyline without a single fight. What was striking was how different the experience was: seeing the same characters in different lights, finding that locations my Assassin had made it into with ease were now impassible because I couldn't fight, and strolling into areas that had been locked to my assassin. I still couldn't get the end game that I wanted, but I still had a whole range of choices about what happened, that really shaped the world around me.\n\nAnd that's the heart of The Age of Decadance: choice and consequence, and making the best of a bad situation. Most of your characters will come a cropper, and you'll be choosing between the best of a bad lot, blown hither and yon by forces you can't control, but still shaping your destiny with every choice. It's brutal, it's rewarding, and it's completely unique. If you want to power game, minimaxing your character and getting everything right, this isn't the game for you. If you want to weigh up every choice of weapon, skill and dialogue because they carry very real consequences, then I can't think of anywhere else that offers this much quality.","February 6","true","24.4"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/huahuehuahuehuahue/recommended/230070/","huahuehuahuehuahue","Large Father","http://steamcommunity.com/id/huahuehuahuehuahue/","99 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nScore: 9.5/10\n\nSummary: The Age of Decadence is a must own for fans of classic CRPG gameplay. Every aspect of the game demonstrates the amount of love and attention to detail the developers have put into their work. Built around replayability and written with a smart, dry wit, this title is a dream come true for anybody who longs for the days of Planescape: Torment and Arcanum. The requirements of metagame knowledge and the staggering difficulty, however, make this game for a very specific audience and have the potential to frustrate even the most seasoned gamers.\n\nThe Setting: The Age of Decadence takes place in a world with post-apocalyptic, steampunk, cosmic horror, dark fantasy, and ancient historical inspirations. The settlements on the surface of the game world look like historical Roman or ancient Middle Eastern cities and are written and populated to feel like authentic Dark Ages societies. Dig deep enough, however, and you'll see that the game's grounded surface hides a lot of ancient rituals, bizarre machines, and sleeping monstrosities. The historical sense about most of the game's political intrigue makes the supernatural elements even more mysterious and intriguing.\n\nThe Character System: You play as a man or woman from one of eight different backgrounds: assassin, thief, praetor, loremaster, grifter, drifter, merchant or mercenary. Once you choose one of these backgrounds and customize your appearance (there are a solid number of options for an isometric game), you allocate statistics among several primary attributes and skills. The primary attributes are similar to Fallout's SPECIAL statistics, but the skills are something else entirely. Skills are divided into combat and civil skills; at character creation, your physical stats (strength, dexterity, constitution) determine how many points you may spend on combat skills, while your "cerebral" stats (perception, intelligence, charisma) determine civil skills. Rather than experience points, the game rewards quest completion and the achievement of certain feats with skill points, which may be focused in either type of skill. Certain world interactions will grant specialized combat/civil skill points as well. The system does a good job of representing abstract concepts with statistics, which carries over from game mechanics into narrative often, as your interactions with people and things will be determined by base statistic checks frequently (i.e. are you strong enough to open the door? are you smart enough to figure our what this guy is saying?).\n\nThe Gameplay: The most common way to play this game is to specialize either in civil skills or combat skills. While hybrid builds are possible, they require very tight management of baseline statistics and skill points and an amount of metagame knowledge that a first or even second or third time player will not have. The game emphasizes "choice and consequence" and unlike in many other titles, that includes how you build your character: what opens up one path will prevent you from going down another permanently. While this may frustrate players who enter with the mentality of experiencing everything at once, this gating effectively makes your character seem like a realistic member of the game world rather than a superman and more importantly encourages multiple playthroughs with multiple builds.\n\nThe combat is turn based and enormously difficult. You the player have no inherent advantages over NPCs whatsoever and unless you build the right skills and take advantage of the right tools, you will die repeatedly. On the one hand, this system can make combat immensely fun and rewarding if you like challenge: you'll feel like you've earned every victory. On the other hand, when your stats are too similar to your enemies', RNG can be what wins you the day or loses it, resulting in a lot of swearing and loading savegames. I would argue that this RNG dependency is one of the game's few big flaws.\n\nThe Writing: Age of Decadence is one of the smartest and most fascinating role-playing games of all time, in my opinion. Be warned that the experience is rather cold and impersonal. While your masters will reward you and praise you for succeeding, your character will never have a close circle of friends and a love interest like the characters in many other RPGs. That's because the game is really about the world more than it is about you. Much like Dark Souls, your character in this game is merely a vessel/agent by which you can experience the story. The real main characters are the people for whom and against you'll be working and some of them are rather memorable, like a condescending ancient construct and a slimy merchant who may or may not keep conning you throughout the story.\n\nThe setting is what really makes the game. The Roman-inspired themes are well handled: it's clear the developers did their research, but have still made their world unique enough not to be a copy-paste of ancient history. The mixture of steampunk elements, futuristic elements, long-gone magic, and cosmic entities definitely lend to this distinct voice. What's more, all the messages that narrate the game in second person (i.e. you enter a large room full of old machines, etc) have this cruelly sardonic humor to them that makes you laugh even when they're insulting you. The game has an enormous number of custom death screens that mock or praise you depending on often ignominious and sometimes epic ways in which you can die.\n\nOverall, it is very clear this game is a labor of love. It's highly replayable, highly enjoyable, and very, very smart. $20 (CORRECTION: 30) US is an outstanding price for a title with so much replay value.","October 7, 2015","true","134.5"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","12","15","0","2"

If you've ever wondered what cRPGs could be from a design standpoint, how they could evolve beyond their limitations, this is it. This game is unique, it offers far more than anything that has been done before.\n\nWhat am I talking about, exactly? "Choice and consequences" - the buzzwords that have been thrown around regarding cRPGs for the last decade or so. Most veteran players realise that this concept is an empty one. David Gaider of Bioware often says that from a design standpoint, you can only give the players the illusion of choice - a choice that has no real impact, that doesn't branch out the player in an entirely new direction. The logic behind this is that most players do not play a game more than once and that it would be far too much resource-intensive to invest in all the branching that would make player choice relevant.\n\nAge of Decadence is going boldly against this pragmatic, safe, frankly boring attitude. It will give you more choice that any other cRPG has ever done. You will miss content in one playthrough. Sometimes you'll make bad choices. Who your character is will matter in how the story evolves. It takes the word "role playing" seriously : how you build your character will dramatically influence your experience.\n\nIt isn't for nothing : the game has been in development for 9 years. A lot of it was part-time, true, but the amount of content here is staggering. This is truly what cRPGs can be. If you've ever felt like this genre was stagnating, if you're wondered how they could realise freedom in a game such as this, then give it a shot.\n\nOf course, a word of warning : the game is strictly for an hardcore crowd and doesn't shy away from it. It is not meant to please everyone. The setting itself is far from friendly and the narrative has a sadistic pleasure in not catering to your ego. For some it will be a dose of fresh air, for others, well, there are already plenty of games for the others.\n\nSame thing with the combat - it is a frustrating affair, but oh-so-satisfying when you master the system and beat the sh*t out of everyone you don't like.\n\nThe graphics, to me, are quite decent, but some people will find reason to complain. I say f*ck em, but yeah.\n\nBuy this game!

But it feels empty, it has lots of incoherent dead ends, story loop bugs and just basically things that don't make sense.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I enjoyed playing it, however the first 20 minuntes of the game got me expecting a game that would have been so much more than it really is.\n\nPlus the more than extreme dependence (from my point of view) on starting stats for character creation made it a little frustrating for me. There are things that work, and things that don't, and more of the later than the former, and if you didn't build you character in one of the "working" builds, you more or less won't get anywhere or at least won't have any fun getting there while you fail one quest after another. Or die, and die, and die.\n\nI don't mind dying, I don't mind tough games (I love Dark Souls II) but I don't like it when it feels unfair.\n\nAgain, I did like the game, at least initially, and I do like the old school feel this game has, I even loved the fighting system (though I'm pretty sure it's bugges with 97% chance to hit missing 3 times in a row, or enemies hitting me more when I lowered their accuracy than when I didn't), I do like the story too and the concept, but it's not polished, it doesn't live up to expectations.\n\nSo I'm not recommending this review because had I known what I know now, I wouldn't have bought it. That doesn't mean many other players will love it though, so it's more a case of what makes you have fun, and what doesn't.","July 14, 2015","false","36.6"," 140 of 254 people (55%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","55","140","254","9","31"

Looked really interesting, so I checked the site a few times, but the development seemed to have stopped. So I registered the game under 'Vaporware' and forgot about it. And then I saw it on Early Access here and decided to give it a whirl. And yes, AoD IS brutal and unforgiving. You NEED to specialize on one or two skills and stick to it. That also means that your gaming experience will be different depending on the type of character you are playing. It reminded me of Planescape Torment in that aspect. You could play as a big brute, trying to club your way through quests. Or be a conman and prey on gullible victims.  On the other hand, the turn-based battles feel a lot like the classic Fallout games, but much harder. Your character interacts with a world in which your actions can have far reaching consequences. It is a ROLE-Playing game. Be your character. Just play it. It's worth it.","October 21, 2015","true","3.6"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

Each stat increase makes a big difference in abilities.  You explore a world, trying to find out what's happened, encounter the usual suspects and make choices, that result in stat checks and success or failure.   Initially you avoid combat as you'll get killed.  But putting some stats into combat and being able to succeed later is very satisfying.\n\nThe bad: The graphics are outdated, typically this would bother me a lot, but not here.  Still... You can succeed in various quests with different builds, but you still encounter areas where your success/failure completely depends on having a certain stat.  You end up storing stats later to see what you need to complete each encounter, with lots of saves/loads.  This impedes the flow of the game.  You can't just put stats where you like, the developers had some clear thoughts of what you'll need and when, and you'd better made the right choices.\n\nOverall I'm really enjoying the game.  It's worth playing.  Hopefully the developers will do a follow up using a new graphic engine next.  :)","October 24, 2015","true","31.3"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","1"

This game has piqued my interest though, and been on my wishlist for some time but my recent experiences with such things had left me hesitant to purchase it\n\nThen I see that Age of Decadence has a demo!\n\nI played the demo for an hour and was sold, even though I was absolutely terrible at the game.\n\nIt somehow combines the feel of Baldur's Gate, Fallout, and other old RPGs with a new edge that makes the whole thing fresh. Meaningful text content and choices, combat made intense for the risk of it, and a setting where you're only the protagonist because you think you are - otherwise, the npcs are equal. It's absolutely unique while being very familiar, witheringly frustrating while being utterly addictive, and I immediately recommended it to my brothers.\n\nIt restored some of my love for the genre, and my faith in current game developers in general. It is definitely a game I would recommend. Indeed, if you go throught he negative reviews, you'll only find that they consist of individuals who couldn't hack the difficulty, can't be bothered to read story choices in an RPG, or seemed to fail to understand that the game is still being developed.\n\nIf you can handle those things, do yourself  a favor and buy the game.","September 19, 2014","true","95.0"," 25 of 40 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","25","40","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/stechyo/recommended/230070/","stechyo","darthaegis","http://steamcommunity.com/id/stechyo/","140 products in account","Just completed my second playthrough post-release. I think I'm ready to review this masterpiece of a game semi-properly.\n\nThe Age of Decadence is a cRPG that does a lot amazingly. It's one of the few RPGs where the setting and story actually feel related to the difficulty. It's set on a harsh world, with Roman influences, that the gods have abandoned, and mankind is left to die slowly.\n"In a land where the ancient evil has never awakened, the job of destroying the world was left to mankind." From the game's trailer.\nBut as you explore the ancient locations in AoD, you will be surprised, and wonder at what the old world was. You heard tales of gods, Magi, and beings invading the world and causing the apocalypse, but the reality will be quite different. I don't want to spoil more.\n\nThe game promises that combat will be tough, and it is. Until you get good equipment and are skilled at weapons, you will have difficulty in fighting one person, let alone two or three. And when you get to the point of being able to take on three well-armed people, the game still has a few surprises left... There's 7 different types of weaponry and 2 different defense skills, each with their advantage, and alchemy will get you poisons, bombs and potions (not magical potions!), and you still ahve some non-alchemical gear that might help - nets especially. Combat is great, though the only thing I feel lacking is the inability to choose (when it makes sense that you would be able to do it) the exact position you start in the several combat setpieces (no random encounters), since you only get a vague choice once (at least from my fairly limited experiece.) Combat is overall pretty good.\n\nOf course, you can complete the game without ever getting into combat! This is what I would call the "easy mode" of AoD, the Merchants' Guild quest. ~12 hours of tactical skill allocation (so you can get through the skill checks the best way) and a choose-your-own-adventure game with top-notch writing.\nWait, 12 hours?! That's short as hell!\n\nWell... The thing is, AoD respects your time. It doesn't bloat the game time with endless trash mobs (Hi Dragon Age series!) but gives you 8-14 hours of quests with a ridiculous amount of choice and consequence. And there's the hybrid path; hybrid between a social character and a full combat one. This is harder and requires a bit of knowledge about the game, and I haven't tried it yet, I plan to do it whenever I boot up the game again. This is the best way to get some of the hardest content to get in the game. And let's talk about content.\n\nAoD has a lot of content, but you will only access a single fraction of it in one playthrough. The game fully supports being played countless times, as starting with a different faction and origin will give you a different view, a completely different set of quests, and access to places you've seen before. And in each playthrough, you will find something that you can't do because, well, your build isn't right. That's alright! Get a new origin and try a different character build after you finish the current one, and get it, since you should know ho to get it now. This is a game where achievements are actually quite useful, since they measure how much of the content you've actually experienced. There's quite a lot of people with 100+ hours that still haven't gotten some achievements, and that shousl give you an idea of how much content this game has.\n\nAll in all, The Age of Decadence is an extremely ambitious game, and a breath of fresh air from the rehashed AAA console RPGs and the rehashed games trying to copy the great classics both. It's on its own level and it's become one of my favourite games of all time. Thank you Iron Tower Studios, for such a gem, especially to Vince, for both the idea of this game, and the great reviews and forum posts on RPG design :)","January 16","true","38.0"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","0"

"A skull fracture, intercranial bleeding, subdural hematoma. You can probably walk it off."They never said it was going to be easy. In fact, it's entirely the opposite. The Age of Decadence never pretends to be easy, never holds your hand except for the first message that says "This game is going to be difficult." This game doesn't let you play a jack of all trades; you're either very good at one or two things, or you're very dead. Hybrid characters are frowned upon; you have to play your cards right, trust no-one and say the right things to get out alive.\nWhat this game has in difficulty it also has a counterpart in it's rewarding combat system, it's sprawling questlines and dialogue trees and incredibly gripping, mysterious backstories.

I'd say they are looking at this game wrong.\nThis isn't an RPG like many others, where you're 'Killy Mcbeardyson', slayer of countless bandits, dragons and champion of the entire world. This is a game where you just picked up a sword, you barely know which way to hold it (if that) and everyone out there is trying to kill you. You're alone unless you choose a guild to side with, and even then you have to watch your back. Everyone, and I repeat, everyone, in this game seems to have an ulterior motive, a reason for doing what they are doing, and they all want to survive. No-one goes down easy in this game.\nEven if you don't like combat, this game makes up for it in countless lines of well-written dialogue. None of it is filler dialogue, describing smaller characters or talking about the smell of a room or something redundant. Everything is concise, important and thrilling. Throughout many dialogues in the game I was kept on the edge of my seat, hoping beyond hope that my character's persuasion skill was high enough, that I'd taken the right dialogue tree to try and appeal to this character.\n\nTo summarise, this game has a unique, original and well thought out setting (Post-Apocalyptic Roman Empire... I'll let you discover the rest for yourself), a challenging yet rewarding turn based combat system, and interesting, relatable characters who you can never trust, not completely.\nOne of the best RPGs I've ever played. And with a Free(!!!!) demo, there should really be no excuse for not playing this gem of an RPG.\n\njmcone's Personal Rating: Nigh Essential","February 24","true","54.6"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","12","16","0","0"

In Teron, every doorway has a description when you mouse over it, NPCs have time to chat, and it feels as though you have dozens of possibilities of where you take your character.   As the game progresses, it feels as though the options become more restricted, and there are less sidepaths to take for your personal story.\n\nI can understand that after 10 years development, there is a desire to finally get the darn thing out of the door - but it appears (from my perspective) that the later sections of the game have less attention to detail compared to the earlier sections.\n\nNow don't get me wrong - Age of Decadence is a wonderful old-school game, and I heartily wish there were more games like it being developped.  I feel that if this game had been released in the late-90s it would have develloped a cult following, similar to Arcanum.  The writing is of a higher quality than most games released today, and the game's lore leaves you wanting to dig up every scrap you can in this dusty world.\n\nIn the end, do not let any of the above discourage you - it is a fantastic game, it is only the aftertaste that leaves one wondering how much greater it could have been.","October 29, 2015","true","21.8"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","12","16","0","0"

Seriously the tutorial is like harder then most average fights in other rpgs.

There are several factions in the game and each one offers a completely different playstyle and storyline.\n\nThere are some caveats however, for one as mentioned before this game is notoriously difficult more so than Dark Souls, combat isn't exactly deep but servicable, the music is bland and repetitive, the graphics are not terrible lets just say that, despite the graphics the load times are frequent and lengthy (could be my system), this isn't exactly a flaw as it ties in with the replayability but the game can be a bit short however each playthrough can be completely different so if your expecting a long romp like Fallout you will be disapointed.\n\nThis is not a game for everyone I only recommend this game to diehard rpg fans who want to see something different if your coming here from Skyrim or even Dark Souls  and expect to be a jack of all trade character prepare to be dissapointed.","October 16, 2015","true","6.8"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","72","13","18","2","0"

This game is supposed to be difficult in comparison to other top down rpg games. What I find that makes it difficult is the game is designed too restrictively. My longest progression was as an asssasin, but I reached a point where I am unable to finish any more quests because I did not spend my character points gained from exp as I'm 'supposed' to. At least as far as I can guess. I've tried other characters with diffrerent roles and I become too annoyed that i'm not spending points as per, i'm assuming, the developers expect you to. There is almost no leeway to create a variation on a character. My assassin, to continue to progress, should not have any points spent in anything except fighting stats, sneaking, alchemy, and crafting. To finish the game as an assassin you can't do it as a charismatic killer or someone who is able to do stealth kills. Want to be a lore master who can also fight at least decently? Not happening. In the end I'm finding not spending points specifically right my characters were too limited for me to enjoy completing quests.\n\nAs for the dialogue its poor, generic. The cursing seems thrown in instead of natural.\n\nThe combat system is done well enough, but unless I focused purely on combat stats the fights required me to reload over and over and trying new things over and over. My characters began to feel like they could not handle themselves in a regular fight. Fighting is dangerous, you can easily be killed in reality, sure. But if its causing me in game to get annoyed or frustrated instead of keen to see what I'm able to do the game ends up not being worth my time.\n\nWait for this to be on sale.","October 21, 2015","false","23.5"," 101 of 183 people (55%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","55","101","183","3","18"

You can avoid combat altogether if you're an exceptionally smooth talker. That's how I played my first character, and that was the most immersive and enjoyable experience.\n\nIt's merciless.

You can visually assess your chances of success before committing to a fight, but there are unseen elements that could turn the tide either way.  The core system is simple and removes the randomness and fantasy elements (your gear is a big part of the fight), but the skills and player-chosen styles can easily off-set close odds.  It's actually disappointing that more games don't use a similar system.\n\n- A Skill system that is based in reality :  Your skills make sense and play into the interactions you have nearly every step of the way.  Your skills (and lack of skills) dictate the flow of conversations, turn of events, and the opportunities to explore different paths throughout the story.  You will play a different game with every different combination of skills you choose, whether it's a combat experience or a non-combat one.\n\n- A world that you're actively impacting : How you succeed and fail (depending on your perspective) shapes the course of the story and the interactions you have throughout the game.  People do not forget, and life doesn't just go on.  Not only is the player's experience altered by their choices, but it's felt by all characters and by the turn of events that you witness.\n\n- A game you'll have to replay : Beacuse the play styles are so different, and result in such a different story experience, you'll be surprised at how much you missed in a single play through.  The dialogue is rich, and the story thorough, well planned, and well-guarded.  You won't learn things for no reason at all.  You'll hear the common woes of the people you meet, but you'll actively need to pursue the pieces of the puzzle if you want to put it together.   Because different choices result in different experiences, you may meet the same people across different play-throughs but feel like you're talking to a very different person.  The game is fantastic about making the characters dynamic, and you'll realize that you're really only ever getting to know someone from the perspective of their disposition toward you and the way you've impacted them.\n\nOne Con to speak of:\n\nWhile the game is great there is one big draw for me.  I wish the game was longer, or bigger in scope.  I wish there were more cities, more regions, more items, more characters, more everything.  I realize there is always budgets, but this is a game we would all benefit from it being bigger.  I want to be playing my favorite characters right now, but I've already done everything and beaten the game, so that's that.  :(   Some play styles are quick.  You'll hit an ending without realizing what you're getting into.  It will make sense in the grander scheme, but can feel like you just dumped all your hopes for that character and that play through down the drain.\n\nOverall, I would definitely recommend this game.

Since there are so many clichés and misconceptions about what a RPG should look like nowadays, some warnings are in order. This way we can begin to talk about the game in comparison with what it is not. First, it is worth mentioning that if your idea of RPG is that of an action game in which you just push buttons to kills everything in sight, you will be disappointed. AoD is not the typical action RPG. Combat is brutal. If you don’t think tactically, you die horribly. If you pick up every fight, you are history. The game has the same unforgiving learning curve than Gothic 2, if not harder. However, despite its combat system being difficult to master, it is fair.\n\nSecond, AoD is not a traditional RPG full of self-indulgent common places and bland quests. Don’t expect to get a job in the tavern to kill rats in the basement. You don’t have a group of buddies that will be part of your team. Do you want to be the Mr. Nice Guy that careless helps anyone that cross your way asking for help? Good luck with that. People will take advantage of you and gut you like a fish. You cannot be successful in every quest without ruining other people’s interest. If you defy powerful people they will mark you for revenge. AoD looks like a Hobbesian state of nature or the world of Game of Thrones without the most superficial characters. There is no space for quixotic dreamers here and you can’t survive for long if you don’t stay alert all the time.\n\nOf course, you can’t “invent the wheel” in the RPG genre and quests involving backstabbing and scheming for power are old news. However, in what AoD purposes itself to do, it does very well and without gratuitous self-indulgence. The character system was carefully designed and integrated with an immersive and addictive gameplay. Every single stat and skill have relevance and could make a difference between success and failure. Do you need to pass unnoticed by the guards? You have to sneak. You can’t sneak? Try to fool them with your disguise or persuasion. You can’t fool the guards? You have to fight or you are dead. Reactivity is key and your choices matter. There are no cosmetic decision here. In my second playthrough as an assassin, I end up on a very distinct path than the first and I suspect that in a third playthrough as an assassin I would still have many open possibilities. Considering that the game has seven backgrounds/professions at the start of the game (assassin, merchant, grifter, drifter, praetor, loremaster and mercenary) and each has unique quests, replay value is enormous.\n\nAll the elements of the game are top notch. The instrumental soundtrack is beautiful and captures the atmosphere of a post-apocalyptic world “inspired by the fall of the Roman Empire”. The graphics are good, but don’t expect the next generation graphics here. This is not a game full of cinematics that push your PC performance to the limit. Which is fine given the circumstances: we are talking about a cRPG produced by an indie studio without kickstarter funding.\n\nBut what really stands out above everything else is the writing. The writing is strong and consistent. There is always a risk that a game with so much writing end up being compared with Planescape Torment, the classic that pushed the boundaries of game writing to insane levels. Fortunately, AoD achieved the feat of being even better. The lore is sophisticated and since every single quest is connected to the main plot, the game feels truly dense. The absence of filler quests is irrelevant, since there is much to explore. The biggest city of the game, Maadoran, is not gigantic as Athkatla of Baldur’s Gate 2, but it is definitely more meaningful. NPCs and their motivations are believable. Dialogues and quasi-literary “scenes” are memorable, reminding us of the scripted interactions of Darklands. And even in the middle of all the backstabbing that are some moments genuinely warmhearted – came to mind the dialogue with a farmer that cries about his tough life.\n\nAoD have been in the developing process for 10 years, which is perfectly reasonable for a RPG of that caliber, especially one made by a first timer indie studio (let’s not forget). Some little design tweaks and polishing of rough edges are necessary, but 90% of the game is already finished and 19 locations out of 22 are available in the Early Access build. I have a fear though that because AoD took so long to see the light of the day it will fail to live up to the hype of its hardcore fans or end up being treated with indifference for most RPG gamers. I hope that I’m wrong. AoD has all the marks of a classic. Let us give it all the praise it deserves.","August 1, 2014","true","273.5"," 24 of 39 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","24","39","0","0"

It's a rough around the edges RPG in the vein of the original Fallout or Arcanum.  The gameplay mostly takes place in one of three areas: dialog screens with skill checks and choices, the openish world exploring, or the combat screen.  And yes, the graphics are atrocious, but think of it like you thought of Mount and Blade, in that it offers something pretty unique for where gaming is nowadays.\n\nThere's turn-based combat which is actually very intelligent, with characters being able to perform multiple types of strikes with various effects (i.e. an aimed attack at the arms reduces the opponent's attack accuracy. at the legs reduces his/her dodge ability and mobility) based on their weapon of choice.  There's many weapons, a crafting system, and explosives made via alchemy.\n\nThe biggest problem with the game is tied to its biggest strength, which is the cause and effect.  The fact that it's so responsive is great.  There's many outcomes to most questlines.  This is a great thing, and it's the biggest reason to get the game as far as I'm concerned.\n\nUnfortunately, the skill checks are really demanding and very arbitrary.  They're fun at first but only if you don't think about how arbitrary they are.  I enjoy the idea of a skill check and I've loved them in literally every other game I've seen them in, including the aforementioned Arcanum and Fallout.  It feels rewarding to make a character a certain way and have the game recognize that character's specialty. Nice to have a smart character with new dialog options that a tough dumb one doesn't get to even see.\n\nEach skill is ranked from 1-10, and to increase your skill ranking, you spend skill points gained from quests.  Dialog checks use these 1-10 rankings to determine outcomes.  So you'll see [intelligence] precede a line of dialog and realize that its success or failure is based on how high your intelligence rank is.  If your intelligence is high enough, it'll read [intelligence success] in green.  If it's borderline, it's white.  If it's too low, the dialog choice won't even appear.\n\nThe following is a typical gameplay experience.  Let's say there's a character from a questline up ahead.  You've saved 25 skill points so that you can raise an appropriate skill when needed.  Better quicksave, because who knows what he'll require of me.  Ok, there's a persuade check in white.  You choose it. and even though you have a 5 persuade rank, you fail.  Ok, reload the quicksave and put the skill points into persuade so you now have 6 persuade.  Half the time, it'll still not be enough persuade.\n\nLet's say that this time, 6 persuade is enough to pass.  Ok, keep talking, things are going well, and now you've got a streetwise check and an intelligence check.  Well, I don't have the points for streetwise, and even though my intelligence is 9 I somehow failed the check.  Reload, do some quests (of which there are less than you'd like), get that streetwise up, and still fail the check.  Even if you succeeded, there'll be ten other instances of checks during those other quests you're doing and you'll fail those a lot too.  Sometimes not, but it's really just random.\n\nIn Fallout and Arcanum you had an idea of what you'd need to be proficient at going in.  In this game, they've split hairs with the categories such that it's really absurd to think you can predict what you'll need to be good at.  Sometimes you'll think to yourself, why would that need to involve "impersonate" or "streetwise" at all?  Why can't I just "persuade" this guy to let me do what I'm trying to?  Why is this skill so much weaker, yet still included?  Why does this other skill even exist?  When skill points are so scarce, why can't I have some idea of what I need to invest in to get the most out of all this?\n\nSo you save points all the time, do quests, find out the checks, reload, invest.  It might as well be called "Save Scumming: The Game."  That's especially true because of the dice roll aspects of combat, which also feel unfair very often.\n\nThere's a quest early on where a man tells you to kill another man who is threatening his livelihood because they both work in the same field.  In the current playthrough, I'm the apprentice of the man who instructed me to kill the other man.  My character has practically no combat skills.  I don't want to kill that other man but I also don't want to do nothing.\n\nThe choices of that questline are as follows: ensure that your instructor is replaced by hastening new guy's arrival (and announce to everyone that you're betraying your boss), kill the man and ensure the safety of your instructor's job, or try and persuade the new guy to leave.  There's a guild of assassins in town, but I can't hire them to do it for some reason.  I don't get to try and be this new guy's apprentice, or warn him about my boss anonymously.  I can choose to do nothing, but the game resolves itself in a way I don't want, and I miss out on the points that I need to build my character.\n\nSo I picked the persuade option to make him leave and it says it succeeded.  Then I get a new, out-of-the-blue result from a hidden "perception" check which actually tells me that the persuade option didn't affect anything, and that this new man thinks he outsmarted me.  I'm now left with either the option to kill him or do nothing.  Reload, try again.\n\nIt's moments like that which really frustrate the hell out of me.  It's just unfair.  We have a system in place of skill checks, but lets upend it and make new rules on the fly when it seems like it might be interesting for the story.  That's honestly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.  Even the hidden skill checks the game sometimes does are fine, whatever, but don't have a reported success actually be a failure.\n\nI like the game but it's just so damn frustrating to see things like this.  So 7 lore isn't enough but 8 is?  so 3 x isn't enough but 4 is?  Well those 2 Y points are useless then, I wish I could get a refund on that, but the entirety of the gameplay is really just knowing what you'll need beforehand and investing skillpoints into relevant skill areas to keep going.  It kind of becomes just a formality after a while.  You can probably look up online the perfect ratio to do the most content possible on a given archetype's playthrough.  It kinda stinks to know that going in.  I thought the system would be a bit more subtle than it turned out to be.\n\nAnd I did beat the game, this isn't me ♥♥♥♥♥ing because I couldn't beat it or it was too hard or something.  It's unfair more than it is difficult, and that's a real shame.  Still, get the game to support future games.  It has so much potential to be greater in sequels, I think, or future RPG releases by this company.  And it IS a fun game when all is said and done.  I recommend doing a combat character first before doing non-combat, to get a basic understanding and so that you don't get too screwed by these kinds of skill checks on your first play.\n\nTl;dr and summary: The game shoots for the stars and reaches the top of a 5 floor apt. building.  A good game but falls very short of what it tries to do.  Still deserves to be applauded for the effort.  Combat's interesting, skill checks are really random and unfair but do feel rewarding when they work in your favor, graphics are terrible, and the story is pretty good, not amazing though.  It's written in a style I don't particularly enjoy, with far too much embellishing and attempting to impress readers, but it's still worlds better than many other games.","October 22, 2015","true","23.7"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

Similarly, it's very quest focused but unlike, say, Balder's gate the side quests can often have more wide-ranging repercussions.\n\nMore negatively, It's also very area focused, with each part of the story being in a distinct part of the game world. This can be a bit frustrating, as you can't go back to previous areas to do quests you skipped once certain events have happened (I'm a bit of a sub-quest nerd). This is, yes, a bit more realistic but can be a bit of a shock - the transition events aren't necessarily that obvious, so you think you're completing a minor quest but actually it jumps you forward to the next section, with your other quests half done.\n\nIt is quite pricey for what it is.

To be upfront with you, I had alot of fun with this game. It does nothold your hand in any way, and if you make a stupid choice then you will die. If you make a smart choice, you might still die. If you make a set of choices that ionevitably lead to one noble or another ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off at you, you will be ambushed, and if you are not prepared for taking on 3 men, armed-to-the-teeth, wishing to kill you, then you will die. If you ARE ready for this situation, chances are, you will still die anyways. Akin to Dark Souls, this game punishes you lethally and often if you are not careful, however, comma, it has a very generous save system allowing you to save at will, and it auto-saves before anything drastic and at the start of every fight. So, yes, your badass arena champion COULD be killed by a few of the local street punks, BUT you could just re-load in and slaughter them.\n\nSome would say this game nudges you fairly heavily towards going down the path of not killing a single soul: never getting into a fight. I would say that they just push you to make a REAL combat build. You see charismatic, intelligent warriors in other games, in this one, if you want to fight and live, you have to put in everything. So yeah, you are going to look like an ugly brute, and in this world of choosing between the morally shady and the outright evil, you probably ARE just a selfish brute: a psychopath who is just mad enough to do the dance of death over and over. This game makes you focus heavily on whatever it is you are trying to do, and with so many different endings to see, it isn't the worst thing in the world to have to specialize in just a couple skills per character.\n\nThis Game is punishing, and someitmes you realize you went through half of it just to come to a point in which there is no possible way for you to progress (see the part about making bad choices above) and so, you WILL have to scrap that character and restart. It is ok. Just let go of your hatred, padawan, start thinking smart, and hopefully Lady Luck will get you that little critical that will have you barely survive a fight against only one other man. BUY THIS GAME\n\n(PS The developers still work really hard on this game and still add things... they are very responsive to the community and all of their players thank them heartily for their tirelless efforts to make and continue improving such a wonderful and unique experience in gaming.)\n","January 19","true","50.3"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","1"

Thankfully it has been fully released, and the version I just finished was the full game.\n\nAge of Decadence is a rather unique game. If you look at screenshots and the brief description, it might sound like an old CRPG with the intense focus on character building. And it is. But more.\n\nIn Age of Decadence you will never max out your character. It is impossible. The game is not intended for that. Instead you choose your areas of speciality - maybe you wish to be an armour wearing mercenary swinging a hammer at everything, or a fast talking merchant that avoids combat with greasy palms. But you cannot really do both. Not effectively.\n\nYou create your character, assign your points, and choose your background. The background seems to be a rather insignificant choice. The game starts you out in the town of Teron, regardless of what background you choose. Your background merely determines the initial quest that starts your adventure. Theoretically you can take any path you wish after that.\n\nCombat in the game is typical for tactical RPGs. Move along the grid and hit the enemy. Where Age of Decadence deviates is the difficulty. If you are not a combat specialised character, you will find combat most challenging. On the other hand, if you focus entirely on combat (like I did), you can gain an attack that bypasses enemy armour and stabs them in the throat instead. Quite entertaining.\n\nThe graphics are hit and miss. The area maps are beautiful, if not a little repetitive. But the character sprites leave something to be desired. They all have the same base model - the gender option merely adds/removes boobs. If you think I am kidding, know that you strip your fallen foes of their armour and they all wear the same boxer underwear. Females don’t wear panties or a bra, they were the same boxers as the males. And the faces look the same too.\n\nOn another note, this game is not even close to open-world. So if you are looking for a Skyrim experience, go somewhere else. Twice I got locked out of a major town because I left before I was “supposed” to, and ended up ♥♥♥♥ing my save file and having to load a previous one.\n\nAll in all, Age of Decadence is an excellent game, but it tailors to a unique crowd. This is really only a game I would recommend to old school tabletop fans, where a single misstep could kill you. If you are looking for a quick and easy RPG, go elsewhere. If you are looking for an engrossing, lore-riddled game with more reading than anything else, you have come to the right place.\n\nI enjoyed this game. I enjoy any game that lets me leave my foes naked, face down in a pool of blood. That’s normal, right?","May 12","true","14.7"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","9","11","0","0"

Where u win one fight with one gear u may fail other fight with the same gear, u must think and plan what u use. Tactical decisions also make huge difference, u need use the terain advantage,position u self corectly , consider what weapons enemy uses, consider your own attacks type, actually u need to consider lots of thing, but this make the game so much more interesting. One fight may go in so many different ways.\n\nDecision making - actually in this game decisions matter, depending on what u choose game changes and the number of the possible plays is huge. Charakter screen is just great, so many skillz so many posibilities, i love it. Every skill point matters and u need plan where to put it. Even skill description is so amazing, when u get new skill the description changes with the most funny way, i smiled alot reading them.\n\nStoryline and dialogs - story is just great, it will consume u. Dialogs change depending on u skills and choices. Very funny     and meaningfull. I am not good with words to describe them. You need try it to understand.\n\nGame Difficulty - this depends on you and what u wanna play, if u play merchant or Loremaster with talking skillz u will have peacfull gameplay, if u choose to fight u will die before u know it :). Going combat oriented character increases difficulty Huge time. If u go to kill every one in the game - its close to impossible, i dare you try it.\n\nMusic - game sounds and music - HUGE so autentic. When u hit shield with hammer - amazing sound effect :)\n\nEvel sheming - u can betray most of the people here (in game) u can plot and kill em all having no master and rule the world.\n\nFriends - u have no friends in the game, every one trying to use u and frak u big time. So kill em all :) (if u can).\n\nGraffics - i read lots of negative comments for the game graffics and i am daring u to find another game with size 2GB with so much content and to have better graffics, i think u will fail miserably finding one.

Choices matter, both what skills and attributes you choose, but also what you decide to do in the game world. High points for me were both the branching quests and story lines and the turn-based combat.\n\nLow points would be the fact that the end game feels a bit more limited compared to the start in terms of what you can do. The art to me was nicely directed and felt coherent and suitable for the setting, still, I can imagine someone finding the art and graphics a bit lacking. Doesn't really matter to me.\n\nI recommend anyone with a fleeting interest in old-scool, hardcore RPGs (whatever that may mean to you) to check out the free demo and see if you like the, slightly unusual, way the game plays.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tikure/recommended/230070/","Tikure","Tikure","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tikure/","91 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nWhere to begin? This is a one of kind brutal turn base RPG, set in a Ancient Era of the Roman Empire. While there is influences of the Khans, and Egpytians the complex culture that exists in this world. The monsters in this world are the people, and how far everyone is willing to go to stay alive and keep their head out of water. And spare their miserable souls to the heiarchy of the gods.\n\nYou will be lied to, you will be cheated, and many times you'll find your "bad-♥♥♥" warrior being taken down by four thugs armed with nothing but shivs and pants. However, not every battle is optional. Using your insight to find the lies within their dialogue and making decisions that suit your best interest of survival.\n\nCombat is brutal, as everyone else on these reviews may tell you. While functioning on a map that is color coated based on your mobility the game will help you make "smarter" decisions when battling people. It will not hold your hand as you choose the best options each turn. Similar to the fallout V.A.T.S. where the character may choose a limb and strike at the location to of the enemy to cripple them or an advantage they carry over you.\n\nThe dialogue is superb, and the characters all their level of charm. Each offering different dialogue choices on how they feel about you, where you come from and where you stand with other political affilates. There are multiple options, and so many paths that the story will have you wanting to see every side.\n\nI will be honest, the audio and graphics are nothing special to look at, and at times a sense of world interaction seems empty. It would have been cool to interact with the world around you more and utilize it in taking advantges whether it be the height of a tower, or a small doorway to fight enemies one at a time. There are times the game does this but I wish I would have seen more.\n\nOverall, this game is great. It has a free demo, so if anything do what I did and try it. After a while once you truly, "understand the system" you will appreciate the game so much more. Try it out, the money is worth it.\n\n\n","September 16, 2015","true","27.3"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","12","17","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Peerlet/recommended/230070/","Peerlet","Peerlet","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Peerlet/","116 products in account","Age of Decadence is a good game, and which development I followed for a long time. It was pretty exciting to see the result of years' worth of labor come to fruition and experience for the first time the craft and dedication put into the title.\n\nTo preface, I believe I gave this game a good shot, explored the systems as much as allowed despite early struggles, and in some cases reached the limits of its game design. The released demo helps to get a fair grasp of what is to be expected, primarily the level of difficulty in its turn based combat. And the demo extends to other game mechanics as well and serves as a pretty good alternative to a proper manual, which is limited to in-game help section. If anything, if you are interested in this game and its underlying roleplaying gameplay, you'll do well to try this demo before reading anymore of what I want to vent.\n\nNow, having said all that, I must confess unfortunately, my first go at the game was less than ideal. I started out as a hybrid character who does not specialize in any specific task, but realizing my error, later tried at every turn to focus on a defined set of skills. The game experience changes markedly depending on what character you create, to the point that the most important choice in this game becomes the character creation.\n\nSome of the skills are definitely more useful than others, the most overlooked of which is Etiquette that I made a mistake of investing a couple points in, deluding myself a well adjusted swordsman or some such. Many skills aside from Alchemy and Crafting find their use in dialog checks, especially Streetwise and Persuasion. It is rather unfortunate that Stealing or Lockpicking are relegated to dialog choices rendering many of the NPCs and buildings in the game to merely decorative stand-ins.\n\nI found that due to the emphasis on choices and consequences, a large swath of content is gated behind certain checks based on these skills. For a character who against common sense aspired to be a jack of all trades, this created a funneling effect where I didn't have any choice being carried along the base plotline just to continue the motion of seeing to its conclusion before finding myself in a yet another similar situation of a pigeonholed exit. Rather ironic that the character with a broad skill set has no place to apply his trade, however meager they be. The passage of time remains as much of a mystery as the relics of the bygones world strewn about this post-apocalyptic world, burying some quests under the sands of time leaving no trace while others remain unperturbed.\n\nIt all snowballed to a point the game simply and literally refused to budge, a hard crash within the game world with no exit to desktop, only an obscured 'exit' sign awaiting those who had failed the experiment to boot you unceremoniously to an ignoble end. Exit and New Game would have been a more fitting and compassionate choice.\n\nDid I have any more fight in myself after this draining exercise to subvert the game system to deliver my game avatar to an end commensurate with the effort to create him, identify with him, and navigate him? Not really. What I had really wanted was the game experience tailor made that gave way to whatever whim my character may take fancy in, the menagerie of choices borne out of randomness. Age of Decadence wouldn't give an inch to such nonsense and will hold no prisoner of my miserable dreams and hopes, of working with my deeply flawed character, holding his hand as we skip toward the Gates of Hell. It boiled down to 'decadence' in exclusivity that ran contradictory to my usual playing habits.\n\nIt is understandable that there is only so much the developer of six or so people can do to take account of all options and actions that a player may take, and the game doesn't suffer any fools. A fool that was me bumbling through the wonderfully created world of fascinating lore and history. Overall I enjoyed it while it lasted, but there was no catharsis in this suffering, only the New Game offering a glimmer of new hope, and richer experience to be borne out of more wiser and determined roleplaying.\n\nRecommended, for the richness of the world, the choices a player has, and the world that compute and react to those choices. Just be sure to specialize, use common sense, and stay within the pages of this Choose Your Own Adventure. Do yourselves a favor and try the demo.","November 5, 2015","true","48.0"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","12","17","0","0"

It's a post-apocalyptic world in a Roman & Arabian inspired setting. However, as you explore more of the world and discover some of its long lost secrets, you'll also find elements of fantasy and sci-fi as well. It makes for a strange & interesting mixture but the game manages to pull it off without making the world feel random and incoherent.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, if you play the game as non-combat based character, it plays less like a typical CRPG and a lot more like an adventure game with stat-based dialog checks and a heavy emphasis on choices & consequences and non-linear progression.\n\nOne of the great things about the game is that there's practically no filler content. There are no tedious slogs through boring dungeons or endless waves of repetitive combat encounters. The game also has a fast travel system that lets you instantly teleport between locations, something I'm not a huge fan of in most RPGs but here it actually works in the game's favor. This results in the game being on the shorter side for this type of game (it will take you about 15 hours on your first playthrough but I can easily see someone finishing the game in around 5 hours on repeat playthroughs). However, considering the game just begs to be replayed multiple times, this is something you'll appreciate.\n\nThe biggest issue with AoD is that it doesn't make the greatest first impression. The starting area is visually the least interesting area in the game and a lot of the stuff you do in the starting area is relatively mundane compared to what's in store later in the game. Also, the 3D graphics and top-down viewpoint don't work well together, resulting in you constantly having to rotate the camera. But if you can get past these things, you'll find an incredibly compelling world to explore where you'll go to any length to learn more about its secrets (like sacrificing a whole bunch of slaves!)\n\nHighly recommended for fans of turn-based CRPGs with a heavy emphasis on replayibility & choices and consequences. Actually, due to the variety of playstyles available, even if you're not a fan of turn-based combat, I'd still recommend trying to play it more like an adventure game with a non-combat character just to experience the setting and story (I completed the game without once getting into combat).","January 7","true","18.8"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","12","17","0","0"

The skills you equip your character with /matter/ to a huge degree - and in combat, whether you use axes, swords or daggers will have a real effect on how combat will 'feel'. A dagger wielder making quick throws to the legs, then strategic cuts to the main artery versus the 'big sword, big hits'.\n\nOutside of combat is no different; Being able to talk a cult into believing you're the chosen one and having the world react, to starting a combat with slaying half the opponents before the fight's even begun.\nI'm incredibly impressed with this skill system.\n\nThe problem is we've all read these things before, thousands of times; empty promises and we've learned to tolerate them. Iron Tower greatly impressed me here.\n\n"multiple skill-based ways to handle quests,"\n\nCheck. And pretty much every one of them, too. Sure, some of 'm will boil down to combat no matter what, but take it back a few steps and you can see it coming (which is important, because combat is proper brutal).\nIf you feel like you might not be able to handle something ... chances are, you shouldn't be walking in alone.\n\n\n"choices & consequences"\n\nAND THEN SOME. This is probably what impressed me most.

If in fallout 2 you have a few quests where one can choose one path or another - here its only a few encounters where you have no choice, doesnt mean that that choice wont bite you - but hey sometimes you get the bear, sometimes bear gets you. In this game bear gets you a lot - so a lot of different saves may be a good idea since one may want to roll events back a bit and change taken path (have never seen any game with so much opportunity for betrayal).\n\nOther thing that sets this game apart is that you see plotline from different viewpoints - say you a merchant - you set some things in motion and later as you play as an assasin or a thief you get to play part in events. It doent take your previous self actions in consideration, but sometimes i was like "hey, i did that" or "huh, so that how it went". In any role you have number of paths, number of ways to change at least some details of the story.\n\nOfc combat is hard, and getting harder as i write this (AI improved). But its true only if one wants a character that capable both speaking and fighting at the same time. Only a portion of content is availible for any character - more you want to bite - harder it will be to chew. Plus there is skillpoint managment - hard to anticipate what levels would be needed to pass this or that check - so going in blindly and failing only to load and come back prepared is essential part of the game. Ofc here you can affort to fail sometimes and there is some fun in that, but later when you know a lot you can design a character and path that it would take kinda like prisonbreak simulation.","March 9, 2015","true","234.2"," 19 of 31 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","19","31","0","0"

Great difficulty, immersive dystopian roman game world, good characters and storylines, lots of different ways to play. If you are looking for a challenging tactical rpg with great replay value this is it. If you want to feel godlike and wade through dead enemies, I'd head elsewhere.\n1) High difficulty/you are not god. Not every fight/situation is win-able sometimes it's best to avoid an area/quest/person. I love this because it really enhances a feeling of realism/roleplay.\n2) Immersive dystopian game world with tons of lore and a basis in roman history. I think that speaks for itself.\n3) Characters and storylines. This definitely added to the immersion. Characters have their own personalities and motivations and on top of that, it always feels like everyone is trying to attain those goals (and stay alive, of course).\n4) Lots of different ways to play. This should probably be at the top. While there are 8 "origins" you can choose to do pretty much anything you want with those origins. Want to be a thief with no sneak or lockpick and opt for disguise and persuasion? Go ahead. Want to completely screw with the system and play a hammer wielding, shield bearing thief with 0 social/subterfuge skills? Sure (though you may not last long if you keep thieving). But let's sum it up this way, I have 5 different Assassin files. Every single one is following a completely different path (some more succesfully than others).\nTo be fair there are a couple of issues I have with the game as it stands now (early Feb 2014). I'm sure others have mentioned many of these (although the game is still a work in progress so hopefully these will be fixed):\n1) saves are sometimes problematic. You can't save during combat (good), but sometimes you don't get to save between combats or for prolonged periods of dialogue which can cause you to repeat certain game sections more than necessary. Also autosaves would've been helpful.\n2) heavy armor and block are almost useless (although this is possibly my incompetence). I have only ever been successful with dagger and dodge in combat. Also, dagger is overpowered (which while I do enjoy sometimes should probably be fixed).\n3) Not quite enough non-combat quests for certain classes in early game (this I definitely expect to be fixed by the end)\n4) This might be intentional, but sometimes you get into a conversation with someone and get stuck at a dead end of the conversation where you only have one or two options, neither of which has a chance of success, and can't back out with a neutral or non-committal answer. These are at points I wouldn't expect (as opposed to the time I screwed up and put my poor character in a death-death situation). Again, it might be intentional and if you save frequently it's not too bad.","February 3, 2014","true","128.1"," 21 of 35 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","21","35","0","5"

If you are looking for that RPG where every choice is meaningful, every stat and skill matters, and the story consumes you, you found it. The setting is unique, resembling some kind of post-apocalyptic ancient Rome with echoes of Cthulthu. Making comparisons to anything is difficult because the story is so fresh. The dialog is perfectly written, with hints of straight-faced humor mixed in with vivid evocations of a harsh world. There are so many branching plots, choices and consquences it's amazing the devs were able to keep track of it at all. And your choices matter big time. They shape the story and yourself. All stats and skills are viable, and have a major effect on how the game plays out. Each time I have played has been very different. I have played every major RPG since the 80's, and then some, and I have no problem stating this game has the highest replay value of all time. There are a tremendous number of story branches, often opening up new locations, NPCs, subquests and the like on successive plays. Graphics are passable but fit well, extracting the most from the simple 3D engine. Sound is excellent if repetitive, some stirring battle tunes and eerie wasteland dirges, Combat is turn-based and very satisfying, fairly deep, but heavily RNG based in it's current form. There are tons of special attacks and techniques, and each invididual weapon has a different set of them. You can develop very different strategies depending on weapon choice, what kind of defense you choose, enemy armor, etc., and strategy does matter; learn or die. If you choose to spec into it, there is a crafting system with about 10 weapon types, armor, shields, helms, alchemy, etc. And then there's the skill checks. Friends, if you want your choices (in stats and in dialog) to matter, hoo boy.  Skill checks can be visible, hidden, or a combination. Sometimes they will be linear, branching, chained together and so on. And don't think your  stats will only be checked in combat, oh no. You can slash your way through, but I don't recommend it on your first try...this game is tough, like the setting it lives in. You can solve problems with thievery, stealth, oratory, assassination or any number of techniques, I highly recommend you try it out. The demo is free, and while the game has made huge strides since it's release, it does give a good feel for the gameplay.  The Early Access is very playable, stable and it's a good sized game as it stands, but more is always being added. The devs are extremely responsive; I submitted a bug report and devs literally fixed it within minutes of recieving my email. Buy this game.","July 14, 2015","true","593.1"," 21 of 35 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","21","35","0","0"

This is hard, but beautiful.  You can go through the game without fighting anyone, if you are a good liar, orator or bull**** artist.

The setting is Roman-inspired low magic fantasy. The game is an aquired taste; it displaces many of the cliches of current RPG games, which will likely turn people off at first. You're not the Chosen One who can master every skill and cleave through hordes of enemies; you're just another guy trying to survive in a harsh world. You can't see everything the game has to offer in one shot, as a lot of the content is mutually exclusive to certain story choices. Theres no level grinding or respawning enemies; every combat encounter is placed on purpose and designed carefully. And they're difficult for the unprepared, but realistic; if a thief lures you into an ambush in an alley, the enemies aren't there to drop XP and loot- they're there to kill you.\n\nThe dialogue is rich and immersive, and the game builds an interesting world, even without AAA graphics. You use skills in dialogue through binary checks, though some have the possibility of partial success. The combat is deep and good tactics are crucial to winning even the earliest fights; if you run and start slashing, you will be dismembered. For the most part all enemies use the same derived statistics as you, so the playing field is pretty even. Theres no HP gain on level up, and the range of hit points is small, somewhere around 20-60; so every point matters. Simple decisions like poisoning your weapons or switching your outcome can be deterministic in winning a fight.\n\nThe level of reactivity in AoD is unparalleled. Theres more ways to finish quests than any game I can think of. If you play without spoilers, it will take you multiple playthroughs to see everything.\n\nAoD was developed by an independent team over the course of 10 years. Unfortunately, this shows in the game. Its rough around the edges, especially in the later stages. The first act around the town of Teron is exquisitly crafted, its by far the best first town of any RPG. Theres so many options, secrets, and great dialogues. The second act of is strong as well, but theres not as many really inspired moments as in the first. After having so many options for resolving each quest in Teron, its jarring to run into quests where you have only the 'fight or pay' options. A lot of the content here starts to feel tacked on, just simple combats that add no real weight to the story. By the time you get to the city in the third act, the place feels empty and unfinished. I wish the developers had had enough time and resources to really bring this region to life.\n\nA common complaint is that the binary skill checks and strict gifting of skill points requires extensive meta-knowledge and save-scumming; this is only partially true. If you play a focused character and stay true to form (e.g. a talker doesn't try to fight everyone), you will generally be fine. Playing a hybrid character does require a good working knowledge of most of the games structure, but I found this to be a very enjoyable challenge. Then not only did I have to contend with the quests themselves, but also the order I approached them. Its very rewarding to tweak your skills to just the right level to set up the perfect double cross.\n\nThe skills are diverse and interesting, but quite unbalanced. Lore and Crafting are far and away the best skills and practically required, whereas Etiquette is hardly ever checked, and most of the situation where you use Traps seem simply tacked on. The game keeps carefully track of your reputation with the world and each faction, but these stats are hardly ever checked, aside from Body Count. Again, I feel that these are more great idea that the developers simply didnt have the resources to flesh out, rather than oversights or poor design choices.\n\nI've played through the game 4 or 5 times now, and its easily my game of the year, and definitely in my top 5 of all time. Its a contender with Fallout 2 and Planescape: Torment. The amazing thing is its this good while only being 80% done.","March 30","true","145.4"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

For example, if you are playing a hybrid build, you may not be able to win every fight or speech check, and if your too bad at putting stats on a character, the game would be impossible for you.

It's even worse with RPG's. By the end, I'm usually so far done that I can't wait for the credits to roll and check it off of my arbitrary "Games to Complete" list.\n\nAoD had me thinking about multiple playthroughs all the way from the initial encounters in my first playthrough to the final few scenes that I could realistically entertain. I never once touched combat other than to see how hilariously quick it would be for my worthless conman. Spoilers: I hit a guy. Once. For 0 damage because my spear I bought for no good reason failed to puncture his armor. THEN I died.\n\nI can't wait to explore a full combat, or at least combat-heavy, route and see those set pieces and scenes I missed. This is without mentioning the very intriguing backstory that is only handed out in morsels for non-Lore characters or people unwilling to explore specific areas due to skills/stat combinations. A post-apocalyptic world in what seems to be a faux-Roman setting only gets better as you peel back the layers of the world.\n\nI only had access to vague lore (but plentiful enough that I could suss out the main thrust of what happened to this world) and the concept of creating a character to venture out and find out every bit of information is so wonderful. This game fosters multiple playthroughs by feeding you just the tiniest bits about what you COULD be doing. I'm constantly reminded by what my alternate reality self could be doing to resolve conflicts ranging as far from smalltown squabbles to literal empire-defining intrigue and revolution.\n\nAge of Decadence is not a massive, heart-stoppingly huge world like far too many video games attempt to be these days, and it works its magic within those constraints. This game knows what it is and how to execute so well that I can't stop recommending this game any chance I have.","April 10","true","7.5"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

To play with the numbers, experiment with the skills and statistics, a game you either need to love doing just that or be willing to spend quite a lot of time with, to get a feel for the underlying mechanics, to be able to explore the many possibilities and varied storylines.\n\nThe replay value is enormous. The experience and storyline vary quite a bit depending on your choice of class or skillset. It can be *very* frustrating to reach a point in the game where you just can't do what you'd like because you don't quite have the stat or the skill - and it can be just as rewarding when you go back and try again after tinkering with the numbers. It is anything BUT a game where the only difference between a thief and a warrior is the title.\n\nI like the feel and the setting for the game. It has a setting and a backstory that is both well thought/fleshed out and unique. Things that happen within both make sense and have the feel of  "A Canticle for Leibowitz" to them. (BTW great novel you should read.)\n\nI am looking forward to playing it off and on through development and seeing what it has become when it finishes.

Would you like both challenging and tactical turn-based combat and a deep dialogue system?\n\nIf so, you have found the right game. Age of Decandence has all of this, in spades. This is a game which does not hold your hand and where your character is a "hero" which can easily achieve anything. In this game, you are only a small cog in a big machinery and if you fail, you will die... a lot. If you want power, you will have to fight for it - prepare to reload a lot and learn things the hard way.\n\nThis is also not a game which railroads you along the same path no matter what you choose to do differently. This is a game where story, choices and character progression is woven together better than in any other game I have ever played. You could only stand frozen with awe at the thought of what these guys could do with a bigger budget. Therefore I consider buying this game being a matter of honor for RPG enthusiasts.

Wait until early release ends before paying almost $30 for The Age of Decadence. Expect the rating to change once the game is out of early release, soon™. If you complain loudly enough some guy from Toronto shows up to defend the game.\n\nIn depth review below, currently under construction, will be finished soon™.\n\nFirst, I'd like to say that is is highly unprofessional to beg for upvotes for Steam games, which one of the devs has been doing on the game forums. This is most likely the reason the game currently holds a 80%+ rating. It is also the reason most of the critiques of the game are downvoted to oblivion. Expect the rating to change once the game leaves early release (if it ever does). Then again, to expect professionalism from a developer who rages and starts arguments with almost every single person who leaves a negative review...might be a bit much. This is the same dev who name dropped (Wikipedia 'name dropping') Brian Fargo (of Wasteland fame) during an interview with Forbes. Screw PC Gamer, Forbes knows a thing or two about vidya amiright? The interview was in March, 2013, so it's about two years old now as of this day and is quite dated. Let's set the facts straight: Brian Fargo doesn't even know that the dev who mentioned him exists.\n\nTo say that this game is difficult is a bit of a misnomer. Difficulty implies skill. There is no skill involved in knowing which non-combat skills to dump and which to pump in order to pass simple yes/no skill checks in order to skip fights. Much of this game plays like a visual novel, and the 8 separate main quest lines are in reality different facets of the same story. The story is quite original actually, who's ever heard of a isometric post-apocalyptic turn based RPG before?\n\nThe innovation doesn't stop there. The main quest line take place in the aforementioned 2 towns (which comprise 75% of the game's total content). The trouble with that is, each questline only has 3-4 quests, and they comprise of game changers such as 'kill 2 spies and then return to me'. Most of the quests take about 10 minutes to finish, depending on how fast you read. The problem with that is it leaves very little replay value, as once you've read the story, you can literally finish the quests in about a minute or so if you so wish.\n\nThe combat is stale and more of a chore than anything. With the recent nerfs, oops, I mean recent changes* to heavy armor, most people will be running the same old light armor/axe/hammer cookie cutter again. I've played through the game with a talker (focus on civic skills and no combat), a fighter (combat character with alchemy skills), and a hybrid (bit of both). That's about the only 3 builds viable for this game.\n\nThe innovation continues. You can target body parts in combat, and choose whether you want fast/heavy/targeted attacks, which use different amount of action points. Action points? Where do people come up with this stuff?\n\ninb4 angry Russian gamers.

Because I condsider myself to be a grown up, serious man, and yet I am bound to sound like a complete fanboy here. Yes, I am impressed by this game this much.\n\nYou have probably already read what Age of Decadence is about. An RPG in a roman-style setting, but with a unique history. The game features several personal backgrounds to start from, and your choices have an immense impact on how the story unfolds. There are also several competing or collaborating factions in-game that you can side with. And betray.\n\nThe writing is very strong. It features some trademark dark humor, and the story is mysterious and intriguing. You get to know parts of the history of the world depending on the route you choose to follow. You won't have the complete picture until you replay the game a few times, making different choices. The mystery unfolds gradually, yet each playthrough feels satisfying in its own right. Impressive stuff.\n\nYou can play Talker-style and avoid combat, Fighter-style and avoid the socializing or as a hybrid Talker/Fighter and do both talking and fighting. This last style is the hardest one, and it is recommended that you leave it for after you are bit experienced with the game.\n\nCombat is turn-based and quite challenging. Make no mistake, you are going to die a lot. If you are a gamer with determination to master the system and overcome difficulties, you are in for a lot of fun. If you prefer games where you proceed by clicking mindlessly on enemies or discussion options, AoD may not be for you. This is not a time-waster game, it is a game that demands your attention. But also it is a game that rewards the effort you put into it.\n\nC&C (Choice and Consequence) is an element of RPGs that is usually not taken very seriously in our times. It is very hard to implement in computer games (very demanding in resources and development effort). And here comes AoD, an effort by indie developers, showing everybody how it's done! Your choices really matter here. For the story, for the people around you. For your future. I am just amazed how such a small team of developers offered the best C&C I have ever seen in any computer RPG ever. On the other hand, keep in mind that there is a side effect of C&C:  you may very well make bad choices and fail. So you 'd better consider your options carefully.\n\nIn conclusion, Age of Decadence has been a wonderful surprise for me. I consider it to be one of the best games I have ever played, an unexpected Masterpiece of a RPG. Strong writing, unprecedented C&C, and an immersive, intriguing world awaits those brave enough to approach and determined enough to persevere. If you like what this game has to offer, you will realize that you can find the same qualities nowhere else. And you are going to be grateful for the time that you decided to venture into the Age of Decadence.\n\n\nPS. Note that I own the game on different platforms and my playtime here may show as non-existent. I am currently in my 3rd playthrough, and have certainly invested a lot more than 100h in this game. And I am not even half-done yet, I just can't get enough of it.","April 17","true","0.1"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

In which every quest can be solved the heroic way? In which weak npcs cry for help and you're coming for their glorious rescue? If you want to try something different, then try this game!\n\nIt's not the type of mainstream rpg as described above. It simulates a realistic environment loosley based on the late Roman era. And as such it is dangerous. You actually have to play the role of a Roman citizen and see things from his perspective to survive. People will screw you over for some gold coins and you literally cannot trust anybody. Everyone seems to have their own agenda and will use you for their own sake.\n\nYou are tossed into the middle of this chaos of politics, intrigues, war and struggle for power. And it is totally up to you which side you join. What stands out the most is the variety of possibilities to achieve a goal or a quest. For instance, you can fight, smooth talk or do it the stealthy way to complete a quest. How you do it depends on your character. For example, if you decide to be a warrior you will most probably fail any attempts to solve a situation by talking and vice versa.\n\nThe game is quite challenging and I salute the developers for creating such a non-mainstream rpg. I like it a lot.\n\nIf my brief description of the game sounds intriguing to you, then buy it!

This is Gamer Guy (In a Suit) from the Echo Army YouTube channel! Today I am bringing you a review of the new indie RPG, The Age of Decadence!\n\n(NOTE: This game was reviewed using a key provided by the Developer)\n\nVideo Review:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/RqjaQAvvcN4\n\nThe "Too Long, Didn't Watch" Review:\n\nThe graphics are dated, the music is meh. The combat is very, very hard. The replayability of this game is ridiculous. Many, many dozens of hours are potentially available here. Very massive, very immersive story full of choices....and consequences. Truly a gem and that rare game that's worth the full price. 5/5 Worth every freakin' penny.\n\nThe "Meat & Potatoes" Review:\n\nJust exquisite. Ten years in development, and it pays off well. I will replay the hell out of this game and be on the edge of my seat through each and every playthrough. No magic and dragons and the like. No easy, kill everything to grind away mechanic. No, my friends. You are here to PLAY this game. To outwit this game. To outsmart the 100+ named and 750 "generic" characters. To master the games 600,000+ words of dialogue. This is a game for the ages, in my humble opinion. It will never bowl you over graphically, but it'll leave you wanting more and more and dying to see each and every aspect of the worlds story. You become immersed into this game and it's world very easily. The clunky movement is quickly overcome. The dance through the dialogue is forever enchanting. Try the demo, it's entirely free. I too would be THAT confident if I released this gem of a game. You'll want more. And more. And more. Start playing now. Quit wasting time with the reviews. 5/5 and worth every penny.\n\nHappy Gaming!!!","November 2, 2015","true","2.7"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","10"

Make sure your expectations are properly set, because this is not Fallout or Baldurs gate. It has tons of lore and an interesting setting, however whatever  skills you choose at the beginning of the game will dictate pretty much the rest of the game.

Is it perfect ? No, there are a lot of things that could be better and so on. But all those things are insignificant to what Age of Decadence does.\nI knew Age of Decadence probably will be good RPG, i omitted early access because i didn't want to destroy my fun playing unfinished game. What surprised me was that Age of Decadence simply took my expectations and run away with them.\n\nSo to start. I think Age of Decadence is imo game that should be classified with Mask of the Betrayer and Planescape: Torment. After finishing it, feeling i got is essentially like those games. Here story is main focus. Difference though is that in both Planescape and MotB there was central story you followed but in AoD there isn't one. AoD gives something much more important. True Role-Playing. Game doesn't pigeon hole you to one story you should follow. Game instead gives you every tool you can wield to shape your character and your future. Unlike Planescape and MotB game doesn't give you fake "discoveries" to make. In those games almost everything is set for you to uncover it. In AoD literally everything is for you to explore and to know and game doesn't set you on linear journey in which you will see most of the things. You can learn of secrets, rumors, events and so on and only you can verify them. Every-time you delve into some event you have this feeling that what you did is not the end and there is something more under it. This sense of unknown is what both PST and MotB didn't have and why AoD is just so awesome in that aspect.\n\nUnlike most of RPGs AoD delivers trully RPG aka Role Playing game. AoD campaign outshines even PnP RPGs in amout of options you can choose and play. Even if you would have best game master i bet 100$ he wouldn't be able to accommodate to so many options game gives. More that that we are not talking here about just C&C, we are talking here about THE C&C. There is like ♥♥♥♥ ton of choices in in AoD that completely changes things and world in game. My only minor complain is that almost all C&C don't have hidden consequences that can bite you in ♥♥♥ later in game (from my play trough though), usually if you have to choose something outcomes are usually short lasting and predictable.\n\nI absolutely love how game handles events. When you do something you usually are taken to scene of event instead of trekking whole city to it. This disallows preparing for combat events and you usually start in place designer wanted not where you wanted it.\n\nStory itself is fascinating. I really really really liked it. Which is achievement itself when you consider just how different one playthrough can be. I don't want to spoil anything but my character was combat oriented and story by end of it really really got interesting despite fact that i played basically murder machine with head count something above 60. Ending i got felt just right to what i did in game. It wasn't grand or amazing. It just fit my character well.\n\nThis is the benchmark all role playing games will be compared to from now on.\n\nI really wish game had 2D background. Listening to this small but amazing OST really sets the tone and i feel 2D handpainted backgrounds would really really make game a lot better.\n\nI played in my playtrough as combat oriented character (literally 10ns in almost all physical skills) and i can safely say combat is really really really amazing. It is not the complexity of it but scenarios in which you fight that makes it. Always outnumbered, always trying to scrape barrel for that one right slash. It really gives you options to handle differently events in game. I often had to replay and change my tactics because something that worked for X didn't work for Y. You may not believe it but i think this gme has the most balanced combat model ever and despite that it is still fun and allows for bad rolls.\n\nGame is short but i think being short is big plus here. I finished my playtrough in ~15 hours but that time may wary probably on build you use and choices you make. Ending i got (which i wanted) was really easy to do and there were other things to do, to get different ending which could extend game. Either way game main focus is replay-ability, if game would be something like 50 hours you wouldn't replay it a lot and game literally gives you every now and then huge C&C that can completely change focus of your story. So most fun from game is those replays, to see things unfolding differently or from different points of view.\n\nWhen i finished The Witcher 3 this year i thought RPG of the year was already set. I think now it is safe to say that AoD is easily the best RPG of the year. It is the benchmark we will be using for years or decades and i really really really want to see AoD2 or just continuation of that world or lore. When i was trying to get into game i thought that roman empire theme would hurt game but in the end i think the fit perfectly to that world and lore.\n\nSure there are things i didn't like but those problems are simply to insignificant to matter. I think 5h more would make this game legendary +5 instead of +4.\n\nIn other words Bravo ITS bravo. This is the rpg benchmark it is ♥♥♥♥ing amazing it exists. I hope ITS will make AoD2","October 19, 2015","true","13.9"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

This game is not only a unique experience, but also a sequence of unique experiences.\n\nEvery character you create has the opportunity to participate in events from a different perspective, and I`m not talking about some different set of armor or a few different dialogue options. This is the real deal. This is what you`ve been looking for, when you scavenged through the internet in search for something grimdark, something without fireballs being thrown around, where intrigue and persuasion can solve most problems(and create new ones entirely).\n\nPerhaps you can manipulate the situations, or be a pawn to the power players.  More likely, you won’t even know what is really happening in your first playthrough.\n\nAs you uncover the many secrets and possibilities of the story, you`ll want to live through a different part of it. See how you can influence the world, and learn every possible path and secret.\n\nThat`s why I`m a fan of this guy. He and his companions not only made the game they wanted to make, but also one that they thought we wanted too. A game where actions do have consequences, where every choice can be your last, and where you can`t be everything at once.

It is impossible to play a *GOD* character that is able to do everything in one playthrough. The game punishes you when you try to stretch your character too thin (eg. mercenary trying to be good with fighting skills yet trying to be a con-artist, sweet talker and at the same time stealing stuffs and sneaking around).\n\nYou HAVE to become one with the character's role that you are trying to play in that playthrough in order to be sufficiently adequate to PROGRESS, yes you read that right, to PROGRESS. Think on your feet, prepare yourself like how you will if you are in the situation in other words, ROLEPLAY. This game although lacking in state-of-the-art graphics and requiring you to focus on your role, it did not disappoint by providing you with enough depth and lots of surprises along the way throughout your adventures and decisions. That is only if, you succeed in progressing. Otherwise you'll either forced to end your own life ingame (a.k.a restart, really there is like no other way if your sneak is not good enough because you want to improve your persuasion to convince someone but your persuation is also not good enough :p), or get pulled out and slaughtered like pigs in a pen, despite how unwilling you are.

The tactical turn-based combat system is as much fun as Fallout 1-2, Arcanum, The Temple Of Elemental Evil, or Divinity: Original Sin feature, plus it's really challenging and unforgiving, this makes victories even sweeter and triggers your adrenaline gland every time you're 5 HP away from finishing the final opponent. The character development system is really diverse, both combat wise and text adventure wise. The graphics is a combination of old school isometric and modern-day 3D, once you get used to how the camera works you'll find it convenient. The small graphical details, the lighting and textures are pleasing enough for the eye if you're a high-end graphics fan, visually it's as good as, say, Heroes Of Might and Magic V.\nI've been playing the early access/demo builds of The Age Of Decadence for several years, and the new features and content added always make it even more fun and more polished. The replayability aspect of the game is unprecenent as on every playthrough you can follow a new path and view the factions, the characters and various aspects of the setting and its history differently, it's like a series of books exploring a story through the eyes of different characters involved. The endings are also mutliple, and it entirely depends on your PC's choices and characteristics what he/she achieves in the end, provided you don't fail on the way. Do save often before taking key decisions, both to avoid failures and to explore various possibile outcomes of your actions.\nI'd say I've never been so excited about and so much enjoying a game for several years before it has even been released.","January 19, 2015","true","608.6"," 19 of 33 people (58%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","58","19","33","2","1"

Beneath the surface the player might discover hidden secrets and lost artefacts in ancient ruins, but most likely he or she will end up dead in a ditch somewhere. It's all about making a character that is able to survive and prosper in this extremely harsh and brutal environment.\n\nUltimately, this game requires a different approach. You won't be able to see and do everything in one playthrough. Instead, the idea is to view the world from different angles. The agile thief with knowledge of traps and access to the proper equipment will be able to reach places that are unavailable to other types of characters, for instance. You can play as a diplomatic scholar or a conspiring merchant (etc.). The character system allows for a lot of experimentation.\n\nIt's all about quality over quantity. If you fight someone it's a unique event and contextually motivated (no random encounters). Every quest has multiple solutions. Every choice will have some kind of impact. Most importantly, your character won't be running pointless errands or collecting x amount of this or that.\n\nHighly recommended for fans of Fallout 1 & 2, Planescape: Torment and Arcanum.\n\n","November 3, 2015","true","205.6"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

I like a game that makes you think. Solving problems with a sword has never been fun for me. I like being the underdog that is nothing and needs to work with power. This game has the best system in making me feel useful. No button mashing here, no Diablo Monte Hall BS. Your actions have consequences, npcs will remember things you have done. I love it. Three guys should be impossible to fight in real life and it is almost impossible here. Taking on two enemies and you may survive, but you'll need to hide from the others. I have always hated the games where I could wade through a bandit camp, fighting a guy and his buddy, that is only 20 feet away is just smoking a cigarette. Not here, buddy will come and help. Then you're surrounded and dead.\n\nYou actually need to outsmart your enemie without combat and that is a fresh change in today's button mashing approach to games. I actually convinced one group of enemies to attack another. I then walked in after the dust had settled and claimed victory. No game captures that, but AoD does.\n\nI will say this. If you  like flashy unrealistc armor with shoulder pads that look like they could launch helicopters from, then this is not the game for you. If you are unsure, down load the demo first. You get the tutorial and the first chapter to play for free!\n\nI love this game, but I prefer story over graphics.

If it had come out 15 years ago it'd probably be a classic right beside Baldur's Gate, Planescape: Torment, and Fallout. I played the entire game as a shysty mercahnt and never got into combat once. The game truly allows for pacifist runs, unlike many modern games which sort of allow for it, if you try really hard. The game seems to encourage not running into fights you aren't positive you can win. The combat is a bit slow, and not really exciting, you can't do much except attack with sword or attack with bow, but there's nothing wrong with it. It's functionally fine, nothing to write home about. The story is interesting, but the world is great. I'd love to see another game with more of a focus. This game didn't seem to be totally sure what it wanted to be because the different guild paths are so totally unrelated to one antoher it feels like several okay games in one, instead of one great game which I think it could have been.

I say this because most of the many, many times its blocked my progress I haven’t really been able to pinpoint what particular failing in my gameplay led to the obstruction. At first I thought it was balancing my character too much, so I specialized in combat with my second build. Did this help? Not really; I’ve yet to win a battle without at least 30 minutes of save-scumming. In fact, save-scumming is so much a part of playing this game that it seems to be one of its key mechanics; you seem to spend more time retrying digital dice rolls than experiencing the game’s very interesting setting or uncovering it’s pretty decent story. It’s kind of like watching Gladiator in HD over a modem; theoretically possible but there’s a lot of buffering… That’s why I’d say this game isn’t difficult, though it is extremely obstructive and that gives a certain illusion of difficulty.\n\nThe game is also highly skill-based; there are certain sections of it where gameplay degenerates into a succession of skill-checks. I find this mechanic intensely annoying, for it has the effect of limiting your options to a set of pre-ordained alternatives rather than allowing for more free-form gameplay. Want to use persuasion to get rid of some thugs? Too bad, you have to have the ‘impersonate’ skill. Want to fight with the enemy guard who catches you in the wrong place at the wrong time? Too bad, you are insta-killed if your dexterity score is too low. These little bits of bad game design litter the game with yet more roadblocks on the path of doing much interesting in its world.\n\nThis is a tremendous pity too, because its world is a unique and interesting one. Set in a fantasy world combining the fall of Rome with influences from Arab culture, it has a lot going for it as a setting for adventure. If the mechanics would just let some adventure happen that is… The game also successfully takes the bleakness of a world where all communal spirit and empathy has collapsed (almost to the point of absurdity) and runs with it, which would complement the unforgiving mechanics if those mechanics had it in their spirit to complement anything. Furthermore the game removes some of the immersion breaking elements of traditional rpgs in its style such as instant healing and the ability to possess an entire party of fighters at once; steps in the right direction as far as I can see.\n\nSome people will probably like this game. Some people will probably like any given game. A sizable chunk of me actually likes this game, although on the basis of setting and story alone. However I have reason to believe that, whoever you are reading this, you will not like this game; for it is a game full of dislikeable elements. Its mechanics are retro, as in retrograde, as in backwards. Its conversations force you to play pot luck with the skill choices you’ve made. Its combat uses save scumming as a key mechanic. Unfortunately- because there’s a lot of good in this title- this game’s faults frustrate its virtues (and the player…).

While all three of those assets are truly impressive, what I find most flattering about the game is the story and atmosphere. Whereas a game such as Fallout clearly shows the decline of humanity into its current state, The Age of Decadence merely places you in the center of it without a truly clear idea of what's to come or what came before. I find myself utterly fascinated at how a civilization was crushed before it even began without so much as a clue as to what led up to it. One of the most intriguing concepts for a story I've seen in a long time!\n\nAs to the combat, realism and difficulty...what else can be said that hasn't already been written about?

This game is so vastly different from every rpg i've ever played.  Failed quests don't exist outside of how you felt about them.  Rather, it's about shaping the world.  I love that.  And so different from every other rpg is that you will NOT be able to get every skill check.  Hell, you'll be lucky if you can pass any if you're doing a combat oriented playthrough.  I love that.  So much replay value, and from me, that's the highest honor, as i think what makes a great game, isn't the graphics, it isn't the story, it isn't the items or the crafting or the ai or how good the voice acting is.  It is the replay value.  And there is an immeasurable amount of replay value for how short this game can be.  Before you buy it, i recommend trying the demo, to see how it feels for you.  As stated, this game is quite difficult in terms of combat, but it feels right.  It makes you feel human, just some dude, not the chosen one or some ♥♥♥♥♥.

Edited comments below:\nI only say no to recommending this soley on the current listed price of $29.99.  It's simply not worth this much for what you get.  Firstly you would expect an indie title like this to pay around 9.99 (I could even see paying 19.99) but not 30.  The gameplay is fun and the world story is pretty good.  Combat is very sluggish and uninteresting.  I understand combat is not a main focus of the game and the devs actually encourage you to seek a non combat method to solving problems but it almost appears like they spent little to no time developing the combat system.  The game is not that long either and there is little to no ending.  Once you complete the storyline instead of being treated to a well deserved ending (which is the main drive for finishing a RPG) you are immidietly taken back to the main menu which is such a anticlimax and a let down. The devs have stated the game is about the replayability and not the ending but that seems like a cop out response to their lack of creating closure to their story. Overall out of 5 I'd give it a 2.5.  Half way decent and I suppose if you have a ♥♥♥♥ ton of money just lying around and looking for a game then try it otherwise I advise you to wait until this drops down to 5 or 10 dollars because for 30 it just is not worth it.\n\n\nEdited:  I have been watching a lot of let's plays recently about this game and have played a bit more than from my initial released review. Although I still disagree with the pricing of the game I will say that the story and the amount of care that went into the history of the world has warrented me changing my recommendation from no to yes.  If you are an avid fan of turn based RPG's that are challenging and make you think with a cleverly written history then I do recommend you pick up a copy for yourself.","October 19, 2015","true","1.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pikasaurus/recommended/230070/","pikasaurus","Pika! Pika!","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pikasaurus/","144 products in account","This game is excellent and as far as I am concerned one of the best RPG games of this moment. I generally never write reviews, but made an exception this time as I think this game above and beyond all others earned my time for a review.\n\nThe choices you can make in this game really do matter. Depending on your stats, skills, factions and decisions you are given a unique perspective of the ingame world. The replayability factor of this game is very high as a result of that as you never get to experience all the content in a single playthrough. Your experience is likely very different when you play as a Loremaster than as a Mercenary for example (when you focus on their assumed strengths that is, but this too is not written in stone). A Mercenary will generally experience plenty of combat, whilst a Loremaster generally avoids all combat, but instead discovers all the lore of the world of which Mercenaries generally remain clueless. This factors into the broad variety of endings one can work to. Of course there are plenty of starting alternatives such as Praetor, Merchant, Assassin, Thief, Drifter or Grifter which play very differently.\n\nRPG games are all about meaningful choices and well written stories. Both are incredibly well done in Age of Decadence. If we compare this for example to Baldur's Gate (which I still consider one of the best RPGs), we find that the level of intrigue is much greater in Age of Decadence. Many parties are out for themselves and depending on your lack of 'expertise' in a certain area, they probably will take advantage of you (just as you can take advantage of others when you are competent at a certain skill). Baldur's Gate in that sense was far more direct: kill and loot everything in an area and occasionally help someone when the reward seems greater before moving on to the next area. Age of Decadence can have far more lasting consequences and sometimes it can take a long time before revenge is taken. Age of Decadence adds the element of politics which greatly amplifies the depth of the game.\n\nThe combat is also excellent in the sense that initially it takes some time to understand the interaction between weapons, armour, action points, different attacks, combat skills and support items (such as bolas, nets, grinding stones, various alchemy potions, poisons and bombs). In Baldur's Gate what was the best armour was generally obvious and there was no debate. In Age of Decadence, what is the best armour depends up to great extents to the amount of action points you have available and your skill level. If you immediately wear the best armour and the best shield for example without being proficient in them, you will hardly be able to block any attacks and hit anyone. What is best thus very much depends on your proficiencies. Many other games are far more simplistic in this regard. What is the case for armour is also the case for weapons in Age of Decadence. There is no 'best weapon by default'. In all fairness the variety that spellcasting offered in Baldur's Gate was great and Age of Decadence does not have this, but there is plenty of complexity involved in Age of Decadence to make combat intriguing and challenging.\n\nAge of Decadence does not have a truly open world exploration like Baldur's Gate does, but I do not think open world exploration would be appropriate for this kind of game. For Baldur's Gate it is easy as every problem is generally solved by means of swords and spells and whilst resolving all problems by means of combat are an option in Age of Decadence, it is far from the only solution. You might for example intimidate, bluff, persuade, impersonate, steal, sneak, poison, assassinate or run and flee towards a solution. Perception, constitution, strength, dexterity, intelligence and charisma all play a role for various solutions in the game. Some characters might not notice certain items or objects in the world. Others might not be smart enough to use certain items. Some might not have enough constitution or be dexterous and/or strong enough to accomplish a certain task. You can be sure of one thing and that is that you cannot do everything properly at the same time. You have the make tough choices. Age of Decadence has certain areas and events which will only be discovered if certain requirements are met and thus for these two reasons a completely open world would not be optimal. In any case Age of Decadence does not feel like it is not an open world. In certain ways, the events that take place are much more dynamic than those in Baldur's Gate. Exploring an area can get you in all kinds of trouble which was far less the case in Baldur's Gate. At the same time, Age of Decadence does have an excellent travel system, so that the tediousness of travelling is completely gone.\n\nAnother thing I like is the functionality that the skill crafting offers in terms of stripping items into basic crafting materials after which custom made armour and weapons can be made. Other skills such as alchemy are great in their own way by offering a great variety of options (which generally tend to complement combat skills). This kind of flexibility besides the great variety of social skills was completely lacking in Baldur's Gate.\n\nI have noticed some state that Path of Exile is a far better game than Age of Decadence. I have played both games extensively and I have to disagree. Path of Exile is just mainly about combat and grinding. It has no politics, social skills, factions or intrigue of any kind. Path of Exile does have excellent character customisation, but so does Age of Decadence in its own way. The story of Path of Exile is all in all terrible. It has illogical events....some are there merely to look cool. Path of Exile is lacking in the lore department. Age of Decadence does not have that and the true extent of that only becomes known when playing as a Loremaster. All in all Path of Exile and Age of Decadence are both great games (just to be clear). They are generally not meant for the same kind of players. Some players do not care too much about being immersed in the game....they prefer to skip the lore component of games and just get straight to fighting and for those players Path of Exile is the better game, but for players who want to be immersed in intrigue and get a great story, then Age of Decadence is the far better choice. Few games provide so many avenues which can lead to the acquirement of power just as is the case in the real world.\n\n\n\nI do not think this game is for those gamers who want to play the all star hero who excels at everything simultaneously (and does not lose). Then again, this kind of gamer is generally impatient, prefers high quality graphics and dislikes reading. This game might not have the greatest of graphics, but graphics alone do not make a game great. Most games with great graphics are generally shallow. This game certainly is anything but shallow. It is true that Age of Decadence has a fair amount of text to read through at times, but it does add a level of immersion which would not be possible by other means. If you are not one of the above described gamers and like immersive RPGs which are full of intrigue and choices which really do matter, then I think you will find this game awesome. In a way it is like Game of Thrones. If you think the purchase price is high, then I would recommend putting it on your wishlist until it is on discount. I certainly think it is worth buying.","April 13","true","146.4"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","1"

I cannot recommend this game enough.  If you like to think, if you like significant and meaningful choice and consequence, if you like character development, great TB combat, games where you can almost completely avoid combat through dialogue (if you want), a great story, and a very interesting setting, this game is a must buy.  I, personally, would like the game more if I could have a party (that I create myself).  This is a single character game like Fallout, Diablo, Lionheart, etc.\n\nAlso, as significant pros for me, this game has almost zero filler combat, and every battle is done for a reason.  There is no endless hordes of enemies, and there is no walking around smashing endless hordes of barrels filled with health potions and gold.  This game removed all the tripe from your garden variety RPG, and gave us a sensible game, in a realistic setting, and it all makes sense and is believable (for the most part – Mote in God’s Eye is a pretty far out there story but done believably).\n\nI think people will enjoy this game more if they go into without pre-conceptions on how this game should be as it really turns some staples and conventions on their head.  I also think crpg fans who don’t need all the bells and whistles of the first/third person action games with rpg elements blockbusters from BioWare and Bethesda will find this game to be an instant classic with more replay value of any game I’ve ever played.","February 3, 2014","true","29.0"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"

I am very fond of true roguelikes, and restarting a game multiple times doesn't bother me, as long as I can expect a different experience each time.\n\nAoD does not deliver this. What we have here is a very linear progression, but with artificial limitations force by the extremely stringent stat and skill points. There may be multiple ways of accomplishing an objective, however the end result is essentially the same.\n\nThis model essentially forces you to choose to be either a talker, or a fighter - hybrid builds are invariably fatally underpowered. Generally speaking, since you have less skills to spread your points as a fighter, it is easier to build a strong pure fighting character than it is a pure talker - there are several different types of persuasion mechanics as a talker, which are sometimes tested at the same time. You might be great at disguise, but if the check called for disguise AND trading, you're screwed.\n\nThere are crafting abilities as well, however your points are spread thin enough as it is, and sinking points into crafting can set back your progress significantly.\n\nNote that the above are all gameplay complaints, but I'd like to talk for a moment about the graphics and interface. Now, I'm not normally a graphics ♥♥♥♥♥, but this game looks...not good. At best, the graphics are 10 years behind current gen. I think they would have been better off with an isometric view (like Baldur's Gate) than trying for full 3D. Additionally, the controls are very wonky, and the screens extremely bare.\n\nThe setting itself is intriguing, and is the basis for what hours I did give this game. There are interesting aspects to the story, but some of it is never fully fleshed out, and what is there is vastly overshadowed by the poor overall design.","November 1, 2015","false","4.5"," 29 of 54 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","29","54","0","2"

I know they are still working on it, but the game and story is quite refreshing. No grinding, trash, or junk.  A excellent RPG for those who really care about choices and consequences, and a unique experience. So far, I've explored the first city and hit a few quests that had multiple resolutions and some I just couldn't solve. Maybe later, but it definitely has the feel of a classic.\n\nNot some combat grind like Skyrim, Diablo, Dragon Age, etc, etc, etc. Fights are tough and shouldn't be entered lightly. There are other skills, but when push comes to shove, it's a nice fighting system as well. Turn based, and allows for multiple actions. So far, an excellent and refreshing experience.","June 9, 2015","true","6.8"," 17 of 31 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","17","31","0","0"

If character creation were more generous, or the situational skill checks more forgiving, it might potentially be an enjoyable play.  Unfortunately, the brutal limitation in character creation means that you need to create a character with a singular focus, and then ONLY make choices that utilize those build decisions.  What that means is that the wealth of "options" are in fact an illusion -- if you make a character who can fight, that's your only option.  If you make a character who can socialize, you absolutely cannot fight.\n\nIt's an extremely limited experience in the guise of something deeper and more dynamic.  I wish that I could recommend it, but I simply can't.  There's a fine line between challenge and mechanical encumbrance; AoD crosses that line, to its detriment.","October 16, 2015","false","0.2"," 50 of 96 people (52%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","52","50","96","0","6"

At least if you were born in the 80s.. This is THE classic game you've always wanted developers to make since your glorious hours in Steamworks Arcana, Torment, and  Baulder's Gate titles.\n\nIt is fair and harsh, it is written magnificently, and plays like a fine book is read. This on can be replayed as many times as you replayed Fallout, just to try different builds, but yet more lies in wait.\nAs you find yourself taking different paths in a world that's fate is ever changing from the choices you make. I am not taking Mass Effect Rogue/Paragon.\n\nI'm talking you skip lunch one day on guard duty, stand an extra hour to witness a comet fall, leaving to investigate you discover a small winged creature, It's eye closed you poke it with the butt of your spear, it awakes quickly and stares into your soul revealing to you the fate of the universe before disappearing in a cloud of smoke.\n\nMind Smoted you leave your post, looking for answers. Raiders attack from the weakened position you left at the fort, twenty years later you've become a great Mayor on your way to the throne, but alas civil war erupts for your opponent for the crown was there the day raiders came over the walls and ravished his mother in front of him after killing his father.\n\nAdopted by a Nobel and with a burning desire in his chest to change the world for the better he rises through the ranks becoming a great warrior, with many friends including master's of assassins he has hired on occasion, ending the lives (over the years) of those who manned the walls on that faithful day.\n\nFinding out who you are he sends assassin after assassin you end you, but with your honing of your knowledge over the years you have learned dark magics of protection which you must now utilize in you life of constant attack.\n\nYour people become weary of you dark arts and mean to usurp you with you rival, saying you won the crown with dark magics. Now on your throne with your hand picked elite guard warrior priest, you find yourself at the head of a summoning circle, bringing forth a dark army to subjugate your people.\nSucceeding in your pursuit, you now march forward across all the know world crushing those in your path, for the Demons of Darkness require a bloody toll for your rein to remain.\n\nFive years later your late night secret toilings have produced an answer to the Demon blight, but in the action:\nyou will tear the continent asunder. Or\nYou could sacrifice yourself. Or\nAll the first born children of man will be marred with evil taint in a 40 year Pact.\n\nAll because you wanted to skip lunch.\n\n\n10/10\n\nOld review:\n\nI very much enjoyed the game, but from a testing point of view it's not worth the effort, and not at all the price considering you are paying them to test their beta.

The storyline is very branching for the path you will choose, very responsive to your decisions, sometimes with nice twists.\n\nDo not expect a "kill 10 rats" kind of quests here, the tasks you face are much more complex and sometimes may be resolved in over 5 different ways, overall making up a very fun and immersive experience.\n\nThe game world itself is very detailed with very interesting lore and story behind and in front of it, and is very immersive.\nOf course, if you are playing dumb and strong character, you will not be preoccupied with lore so much, being busy caving skulls of your employers' enemies in with a hammer.\nOn the other hand, for the intelligent and knowledgeable character the world is a whole different story with lore to uncover and people to manipulate.\n\nThat being said, some combat mechanics are very questionable, and since the developer team is quite small, does not seem they will be able to make any noticeable changes and improvements.\nOverall, combat characters will have better quality of life, longer gameplay and overall enjoyment than social talkative characters.\n\nI recommend this RPG, especially to those youngsters who had Skyrim as their first "RPG experience" to see how the actual RPG feels like.","March 20, 2015","true","509.4"," 16 of 30 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","16","30","0","1"

It is very difficult but also very rewarding, and properly gives you the feeling of gaining in power, something done only in good RPGs. There are multiple ways of progressing through the game, although some skill choices are curently not very useful in the early release. $25 doesn't give you many hours of content, but you can replay with multiple characters and have a fairly different experience each time. Overall I support the development of games like this and can't wait to see how the finished game turns out.\n\nPros:\nImmersive world, dialogue and characters.\nGood music that fits the theme of the game.\nPretty deep skill system that rewards different styles of play.\nCombat is challenging and is somewhat luck based but overall it's a good system.\nThe devs know what makes a good RPG and are excellent at having you "feel" the power of your character grow and feel like the decisions you make have an impact.\nMultiple choices in quests, often with no clear answer. Some things will have negative or positive consequences much later in the game.\n\nCons:\nSometimes you can get stuck and be unable to progress due to putting points in the wrong skills. There is no way to "grind" more skill points, so in these situations you are sort of screwed (I'm sure this will be better addressed in the final version, and No I'm not saying they should add a way to grind skill points!)\nOverall not much content yet, you can only go to about 5 locations out of the 20 total, and there aren't that many quests right now. Once again I'm sure the finished game will feel much larger and longer.\nA little too linear - Yes there are multiple ways to go about things and the game is not too linear in this sense. But certain things bothered me, such as my sneaky assassin being unable to go to the temple in the slums without either paying 1000 gold or fighting like 7 guys by myself (100% impossible in this game). You would think I would be able to use my points in sneaking to wait until night and get to the temple, it is supposed to be a whole slums district and one band of thugs can completely seal the whole thing off from everyone?\n\nOverall a very good game. I would give a 7/10 for the early alpha just because it is somewhat low on content but if the final game is as good as I think it will turn out to be this will be at least a 9/10 for sure.\n\n","December 26, 2013","true","13.6"," 17 of 32 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","17","32","0","2"

It's more like a choose your own adventure book than a video game. The 'quests' are all scripted and the dialogue option that you pick determines whether you live or die.\n\nLooking at the game descriptions, it shows that you have the option of developing a character in all these different ways and getting all these cool skills, but you can only use those skills in very rigidly defined situations. You don't even know the location of other towns down the road until you get a quest to visit them, and there's no way of questing on your own.\n\nAlso, the combat is hard enough and the non-combat stuff is hard enough that doing anything other than min/maxing is suicide. So if you're running a stealthy character for example, you'd better spend every single point you can on stealth. No exceptions. You're either going to have a character that will only be able to choose a stealthy option, or you're going to have a character that has no options at all.\n\nI repeat that combat is HARD. They tell you up front that it's hard, but even a one on one fight where you're using a character entirely devoted to fighting is dangerous. And because the game is linear and there don't seem to be any random combats, you have very few even fights with which to develop your combat skills without getting killed. If I'm running a fighter and I can't fight, then what am I supposed to do?","January 30","false","6.5"," 20 of 38 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","20","38","0","6"

While I was initially skeptical and even forgot about AoD several times over the course of it's development, now that we're reaching the end I have to say -- the result so far that I've experienced is brilliant.\n\nAs other reviews will probably point out and as indeed the description of the game itself details, it's not for those seeking an easy power trip or for the casual gamer. Combat is hard. Really, really hard. The world is gritty and characters will often mislead, lie to and cheat you.\n\nBefore I list what I felt were the pros and cons, I should probably put a disclaimer as to that most of my time spent playing has been with a combat orienated character, though I've dabbled with a talker.\n\nThe real positives here are:\n\n1. While combat is unforgiving, it's IMMENSELY rewarding when you win a fight. Especially early on. The combat is also the sort of frustrating, but well thought out system that gives you an undeniable high when you've taken the next step to figuring out what works in your current conflict.\n\n2. Branching paths. Most games now adays have them, but AoD does it well. While you'll still end up in roughly the same places, your path to them varies greatly depending on your early game choices. More importantly, these branching paths can take you through customary game violence to zero bloodshed and all smart - or depending on your choices - very dumb negotiating and wordplay.\n\n3. As I mentioned before, the characters like to screw you over. Well, you can almost always return the favor, sometimes in very satisfying ways. Not that there's much more satisfying then repeatedly stabbing someone.\n\n4. The writing is excellent. While I normally object to a senseless amount of obscenities being thrown about, (which I think AoD somewhat qualifies for) it doesn't ever feel out of place. The plot, which is really whatever nearest goal your character has at the time, also moves very fluidly and I was never left feeling bored or especially lost in the narrative sense.\n\n\nThe cons:\n\nThe only one truly worth pointing out is that the game isn't finished. There are bugs, typos, misplaced dialogue sequences and so on. But that's to be expected until release, and likely a patch or two after it. I'd normally say it's a con for a game with a difficulty curve this high, but I spent a good bit of time in the tutorial chucking spears and nets at bad guys, learning my way through combat. Everything after that was just good times.","August 30, 2015","true","78.8"," 11 of 21 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","11","21","0","1"

Extremely hard combat and your 1st several builds are almost bound to fail simply because you do not know how the game works. So prepare for failure from the start, but dont be discouraged. Sometimes failing in this game can be good for you, more often then not it will just lead you to another path in the story *unless you meet an untimely demise*.\nCombat is extremely hard and while being extremely well balanced its balanced for veterans who played this game for ages, meaning this is like DoTA 3.0 - unless you know what you are doing you might not have as good of a time as you might desire. I might add that while it might seem that combat is unnecessarily hard at 1st in reality its done in a way to draw a line to what content your hero might see in the game.\nGenerally speaking there are 2 playstyles - social and combat. There are hybrid builds in the middle of them, but they are vastly harder to pull off then either of the main playstyles.\nOn the bright side - there is a lot of content and variability to the game * apart from neutral quests*.

Where do I even begin to describe this beast of a game?\n\nRPG's nowadays tout having choices. And consequences for said choices. You'll find that most of the times, they're fairly small and maybe not so imaginative and won't affect the story for the most part.\n\nNot in Age of Decadence! While you are still a player in an elaborate play, you are still capable of turning it on its head unlike a lot of other games today, and I speak from experience given my extensive run into the world of rpg's.\n\nUnlike most RPG's today, you can play as a"pacifist" (I use quotes, because you will most likely be the cause of many a people's tragic "accidents" and "mishaps") That in itself in an achievement - you can go through the entirety of the game without ending a life personally and still come out on top. I yearn games which allow me to avoid killing my fellow men, even though it is encouraged or easier if I do so.\n\nOr, you can follow the path of a warrior and cut down anyone who thought it'd be smart to give a psycho a mean look.\n\nAnother thing that is very notable about this game, is the almost absolute lack of morality! It's almost black comedy levels (I imagine that was the intent, but I digress). And it's glorius! Whereas in other games, you will be condemned utterly as the worst scum of humanity, or your meanie acts will be considered for the greater good. Not here!\n\nIn order to make it, you got to be the baddest badass or the most cunning schemer to ever grace (or profane) the land, and exploit almost any opportunity that comes your way. As told to you by a warning whenever you start a new game -"Look out for yourself, because no one else will". So grab your sword, or prepare your ink and pen, because you are in for a bumpy ride that might end up with you on top of things. Or at the bottom of a ditch after a brawl gone bad.","August 7, 2015","true","176.7"," 9 of 18 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","9","18","0","0"

Get ready to reload, even more often. Get ready to hoard XP until you firn the perfect use for it - and then die and reload again.\n\nAoD is not a pretty game - neither in the visuals, nor in the character. It's an intentionally bland, gritty and unforgiving setting, in which you are not The Chosen One, you have no Great Destiny, and elves, dwarves and wizards neither will help you, nor do they exist. Your enemies will not be All Powerful Demons, whom you will fight with Legendary Artifacts. Instead, most of the time, you'll be fighting thugs or beggars with sticks and stones.\n\nThere is little XP to be had in the game, and it will not be enough to create the Charming Persuasive Warrior Mage Assassin you may know from contemporary titles. In fact, you'll need to hold on to evey XP point until you really, really need to raise a skill (of which there are plenty of, often used in combination). And even, then your Master Manipulator may get shanked by a smelly thief armed with a rusty metal spike. Your Fearless Gladiator can still get stoned to death by angry beggars. And so forth, and so forth. If you try to play this like you would play Dragon Age, your character will die within the first minutes of the game, no joke.\n\nThe developers prepared dozens of death screens for your entertainment, and you'll see a great deal of them, even if you play the game right. The world of AoD doesn't warn you of impending doom, doesn't provide tool tips, doesn't highlight important characters and frankly, just doesn't care.\n\nIf you're fine with all of the above, you may love the game, try it. If you're not, there are other titles you'll have fun with, try them. This is not everybody's cup of poison, as an example - myself. I've tried the game, understand what it tries to do, can appreciate it, but have left it behind.","January 3, 2015","true","11.2"," 12 of 24 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","12","24","0","0"

It all feels very real, very gritty. You're not some god-like superhero that's been bestowed power from the heavens, you're average Joe, and by the way, some guy just stole your wallet.\n\nIt's tough to make it in this world, meaning you're going to be dying, reloading, restarting from scratch a lot, but that's what makes it so immersive. You truly feel as though you're apart of the world. You have to judge characters at a glance, take what people say with a grain of salt, and essentially play your cards perfectly in order to not be slaughtered like a pig.\n\nThe game mechanics give off some oldschool vibes. Most of the story is text driven, and the import plot points of the world are hidden within text with a few random NPC's, or hidden behind certain dialog choices. The combat is turn based, and very unforgiving. You may find yourself cursing your character choices in the character creation and how you can't win any fights because of it, but sometimes that's just how the game plays. It's possible to participate in the whole game without being a proper fighter, but that also means taking a completely different route throughout the story.\n\nThe fact of the matter is, you AREN'T a superhero, and you're not some master jack of all trades either. Your skills, your stats and your decisions with NPC's limit the available routes you can take throughout the game dramatically. They set you on a path that is hard to deviate from. If you weren't good at combat at the start of the game, chances are, you never will be and you better stick to your words. Some may view this as a detriment, but I find that it adds depth and weight to your actions. It also has a nice effect of adding replayability. There are many different ways to reach the end of the game, and I can safely say I've barely seen a quarter of them.\n\nAll in all, I find that it's a great RPG. However if none of this sounds fun, then maybe the game isn't for you. I love it though, and I can't wait for the full release.","November 2, 2014","true","32.6"," 16 of 32 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","16","32","0","0"

I've just finished writing my Early Access Previews article for The Age of Decadence and I figured I'd share it with those that are interested in the game.\n\nThe game is set in a post apocolyptic setting based on the fall of the Roman Empire and features an excellent setting and great writing/back story. The game is still in active development though so there's still much to be improved upon and added and my article talks about the current features but many things may be subject to change.\n\nI'll be writing up a full review for the game in the future which I'm looking forward to.

Age of Decadence gets rid of many problems plaguing the genre, like meaningless filler content and forced player character power fantasies. The game experience is condensed, but highly replayable and non-linear - you'll have to calculate your every step carefully and you never end up having to turn on that infamous "meaningless activities mop-up auto-pilot mode". Highly recommended for fellow "Ironmen", who have innate allergy to the "load game" button.\n\nThe game is really unforgiving, be prepared to invest some time learning the ropes. The combat uses a fairly robust turn-based system, which offers enough variety, like aimed attacks and a well designed weapons/armor system, to keep things interesting. Encounter design is mostly great. Most of the time combat is entirely avoidable, actually I think you can finish the whole game without getting into fight, if you play your cards right.\n\nThe pseudo-romanesque low-fantasy world is really well-though-out and original as is the story the game tells, and I can honestly say that I've never played a game with such a non-linear story design like in Age of Decadence. The amount of player agency is just staggering, and it proves how much dedication and love the developers have poured into this monster!\n\nDownload and try the demo and see for yourself.

If you liked fallout 1 or 2 you will likely love this game. If you played Bg2 on insane this is also probably the game for you.\n\nThe difficulty is exceptionally high and getting started can be like hitting a wall. Combat is punishing. That being said you do not have to fight all the fights or like any fights if you choose a non combat route. If you play a mercenary in the imperial guard you will have some unavoidable encounters, but most will still be able to be circumvented  through alternate means. You can go through the game without killing anyone.\n\nIt is a rpg is the true sense of the word; designed to deliver heavy firepower to distant targets, oh wait... I meant it is a role playing game in the true sense of the word. The amount of text is on the order of planescape torment and there are always tons of ways to solve every problem. You will constantly make dicisions in the game that will completely change the course of the game. The way you solve problems will affect a ridiculous number of things. You can backstab, lie, cheat, and steal and when you do and the people you screwed over find out, they will be ♥♥♥♥♥♥. You can play pretty much any role you would like within the game, but it is not the type of game where you become a god, swatting away flies, destroying omega weapon and saving the world from the evil sorceress Edea... etc.\n\nThe amount of different endings is larger than can be conveniently counted.\n\nThe combat system is exceptionally complex, but simple to start. Gameplay is intuitive but punishing. When i first played this game back in the demo it took me a lot of character recreations and liek 2 hours to just get passed te first quest as a mercenary, because I insisted on fighting out both of the fights. There were other options and those other options were equally rewarding but i wanted to play the hero and whoop ♥♥♥. Playing the game like that is doable but difficult. You can play a combat hero and slaughter everything but the skill floor to start out is very high and it isn't really what the game is about.\n\nIf the things i have said make it sound like a fun game to you will probably love it. It is fairly short if you ignore sidequests and such short but the replayability is very high because the actual size of the game is immense; you will find yourself rolling up new characters to do things you couldn't do the first time through. You will not touch even 10% of the game your first playthrough the mutability of each plathrough is just that extreme.","July 31, 2015","true","99.4"," 12 of 24 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","12","24","0","0"

Every single conversation option that carries you forward in any way simply checks if you have the right character values, so there is really no skillful way to navigate social situations, you just have to know what skills you need to pass the checks. The entire game is hard for all the wrong reasons. A single wrong decision can kill you, but there is no way to suss out the situation and get any kind of idea what will happen other than just trial and error.\n\nYou get situations like this (spoilers): You're approached by a merchant who asks you to come to his house and check out his wares, the second you agree you are teleported to the house and locked in a room with two bandits, you get one more check of your dexterity to see if you can run away, failing that they immediately attack you. Unless your character is a skilled fighter (which you aren't with low dexterity) you're dead. You load, the merchant approaches you again, you refuse to go with him and continue on your way.\n\n\nStuff like that is pretty much how this entire game goes down. You encounter a situation, you try to weigh the best response to it, the game throws a skill check at you, if you have the right numbers on your character sheet something good happens, if you fail something bad happens. The only way to skillfully navigate through gameplay like that is to simply know ahead of time what skill values you need to get a positive result before going into conversations.\n\n\nI have no problem with games that let you make bad choices, but when the bad results are down to skill checks I can't influence in any way I'm not really playing a game, since a game needs to have some kind of skill involved. Likewise, when there is an actual choice involved but picking the wrong thing then just boils down to: Load and pick the other thing there is no real gameplay, since only foreknowledge of the outcomes lets me make an informed decision.\n\n\nSo basically: This game is extremely disappointing if you were hoping for a low magic / low combat game but aren't willing to completely forsake actual gameplay and just quicksave crawl through "choose your own adventure" style conversation trees that can kill you.","October 14, 2015","false","1.2"," 63 of 126 people (50%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","50","63","126","3","4"

Judging by the aformentioned issues, Expect even more that weren't obvious on the surface, either because the devs lack competence, they rushed it, or they were simply too undermanned for an ambitious task.  Which ever way, know what you are getting into if you purchase this.  With all that said, here's why I really enjoy this game.\n\nThe game makes you feel as though your choices mattered. Your character creation is living proof when you're able to complete quests and advance. This feels good. real good. Specializing skills is highly rewarded, and you feel a sense of progression as quests are completed.  You're often faced with difficult and game changing decisions with severe consequences.  Neither path is right or wrong, but it changes the way many factions see you.  People who you once ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off might change their mind about you if you continue to gain influence, and still see you as valuable.  The amount of variables in play keeps me coming back.  This is all from one tiny perspective, as there are tons of other playstyles I could have taken at character creation that would garner an entirely different experience.  That is the beauty of this game.\n\nI would love to see a lot of these issues polished and fixed. This could be a really great game, honestly.\n\nUPDATE:\nA full playthrough of my 'talker' character lasted 19 hours. I was not rushing whatsoever.\n\nI was disappointed to see that much of the choices I experienced were illusion of choice. I say this based on my frustrating experience with an assassin.\n\nAssassin - You are forced to fight heavily armored opponents on the 3rd mission and beyond.  There is no build up.  There are also no alternative tasks, paths, or ways to acquire much more than a couple skill points to progress.  Essentially, you have no choice but to build your "assassin" as a brawler and tank killer. You will literally be storming the front gate of armies.  If this doesn't sound very assassiny to you, it's because it's not.  I would be fine with this design choice if it was in fact a choice, but it isn't.  You might wish to avoid any kind of personable skills and focus strictly on sneaking, assassinating and raw power/speed.  This is not viable in this game because you're often given 1 path to execute a task.  At one point in the assassins story you're forced to either have charisma and impersonation, or fight 2-3 full armored bandits while you're dressed in begger clothes.  This is an impossible fight without cheese tactics or being heavily outleveled from only seeking the main quest.  This is poor writing and laziness.\n\nThere should be basic tasks or quests like 'kill this merchant', 'take out this leader' 'take out this politician', not major game changing quests at every god damn corner.  It's infuriating that you can't simply play your character without dabling in politics.  The devs claim this isn't some hero slays the dragon kind of game, but in reality their game plays out like some ridiculous drama.\n\nOverall: 5/10\n\nBuggy, poorly written, but worth a playthrough IF IT WASN'T $30.  Totally not worth the asking price. If you can pick it up for $5-$10, go for it.","October 19, 2015","false","31.3"," 44 of 88 people (50%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","50","44","88","6","2"

The conversation options were fun (being an impersonator and just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥tting everyone is great), and the skill options were interesting and had amusing descriptions.\n\nI was a bit surprised by the dated graphics but I can enjoy a game without good graphics so I ignored it.\n\nCouldn't wait to play more tonight.\n\nNever has my opinion changed so quickly.\n\nI got to the 'biggest city' and just kept thinking, it's ok, there's bound to be more to it. There wasn't. There are minimal things to do. I couldn't complete any quests because you need to have exactly the right build to pass whichever skill roll is needed. There are hardly any NPCs. There is nothing interesting to look at.\n\nYou die repeatedly, but it's not based on skill at all. You need to reload and choose a different option. It's basically a choose your own adventure game.\n\nI kept thinking it was a decent attempt considering it must be such a small games studio. It must be small right, cos this game has been in development for 11 years! 11 YEARS! WHAT....were they doing with that time? The game isn't even long apparently, so it's not like it just starts out slow, which I'd be happier with.\n\nIt's a shame I didn't come to this realization a bit earlier and gotten my money back.\n\nI feel robbed.\n\nOh, and it's crashes, a lot.\n\nEDIT: Response to developer as I can't respond in comments;-\n\nI meant, player skill. It's all dice rolls. Which is fine. But as you say, don't spread too thinly. So either go combat or not. The problem is, if you end up in combat with no skills, you are dead. The problem with THAT is, you have no way of knowing if it will end up in combat or not because you're not sure if you're going to get the option to try to impersonate someone for example.\nOk so it ended in combat. I have to reload and choose the other option. Hence, a choose your own adventure book.\n\nThe other problem with spreading thinly is, and what I've read elsewhere, you've designed this game for replayability at the forefront. So you put all your skills in one area. So you can only do quests that use that skill. You say you have 100 quests. There are 8 I think, 'classes', and about 10 non combat skills.\n\nSome quests have multiple ways to solve them, one of those options almost always being combat it seemed. But how many quests are geared toward a certain skill? How many times do I have to replay the game to have the skills to see all areas, remember choices, complete all quests? I feel like this replayability factor should be made more clear.\nSome people will love that. Some people will hate it.\n\nI like to play games a lot, but I rarely replay games as there are so many good games I would like to play, and only so many hours in the day.\n\nAlso, a factor of replayability, is locations and setting. You want to see the world again. You say you have 22 locations. I'm sorry but I don't find the locations i've seen so far interesting. They look ok I guess, but nothing that makes me want to spend more time there. In Maadoran for example, in each district there were maybe 3/4 you could interact with, that weren't merchants.\n\nSome of them had rich story parts, but that ended up going no where. No quest or anything. That would be fine, but if you're trying to focus on story and setting, rather than visuals, you need to have more than 4 npcs tell a story, with the rest of the npcs be copy/paste jobs.\n\nI'm not saying it's a horrible game. I enjoyed parts of it.

The story so far is fantasitc, everything blends together so well, the characters are great, the dialogue in this game is outstanding, very much in excess but not without great writing for almost every conversation, I really cannot imagine what is to be added through future updates/when the fully completed game is released. The lore is somewhat interesting, if you are into RPG's with thick story and background information, especially concerning history,(term used lightly) magic and other fantasy elements, you should definitely find what you are looking for. I have read some bad reviews that regard the graphics of the game as subpar and unbearable so much as the game becomes "unpleasant" or whatever, and, if you do happen to be a person who upholds graphics above any other aspect within a game, then 1: You're an idiot & 2: you probably will not enjoy this game. I will admit that the graphics are not "next gen" but if you are not a graphics ♥♥♥♥♥, it really should not be a deterrent from purchasing the game or even enjoying it.\n\nAll in all it is a wonderful game filled with a variety of treats and sour moments, laughs and most definitely tears, but do not let the bad times bring you down, just, try not to read the death screens, they are really depressing and make you feel extremely insignificant.\n\n9/10","June 29, 2014","true","11.5"," 12 of 25 people (48%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","48","12","25","0","1"

In every way. Nearly every decision you have to make regarding how to complete a quest and how to develop your character is a trial and error ordeal of figuring out new ways to die. Most combat situations are explicitly there to serve as dead ends, literally. So if you thought of being some super bad assassin, pouring all of your points into crossbow, dagger, and dodge, you will still find yourself in an unwinnable fight before even leaving the first town. While an interesting and glorious death it may be, ultimately it is simply a lesson in what not to do. So you have to start a new game all over again, and try again with different stats and hope for the best. This makes the entire gameplay experience rather tedious overall. A fact that is compounded by the unforgiveably slow movement speed of your character. I liken the hours I've put in so far to the punishment of Sisyphus, with the boulder rolling back down the hill for a different reason each time. Good premise, good dialog, promising combat engine, solid world building, but so agonizingly slow that it saps all the fun out.\n\nSome suggestions to turn this game into something wonderful:\n- INCREASE MOVEMENT SPEED!\n- more side quests to earn points for character development\n- stat boosting equipment to give your character that extra flexibility in addressing situations, like a bloodstained tunic that boosts streetwise when worn, a make-up kit that improves impersonation if it is in your inventory, soft shoes that improve sneak, craftable picks that improve lockpick, perfume that improves etiquette, etc...","February 27","false","42.8"," 11 of 23 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","11","23","0","4"

I say supposedly because the combat in this game is so unbalenced it's laughable. Every fight finds you out numbered and out gunned even if you devote every point to fighting you will find yourself banging your head as you are butchered by half a dozen enemies and then the game will mock you for thinking you could fight have a dozen guys at once. The world is also strangely bland and empty other than some named npcs who get their own portrait most of the towns in this game are populated by non intertactable generic vilagers who may as well be part of the scenery.

I have played through a 'dialogue' thief and a 'combat' assassin. All the previous reviewers are correct: combat is very tough and realistic. It takes a long while to get the hang of it. Even if you are skilled appropriately, you will still need to use intelligent tactics to take out your opponents. I particularly like that even on a "combat" route as opposed to a "dialogue" route, the game is equally enjoyable. That is very rare in an RPG these days and shows a lot of promise for the final version.\n\nA major con is that there are many, many bugs in this early access demo and it has crashed more times than I can count. But that is to be expected from early access versions and I can live with it given the very interesting story, quests and combat.

The graphics in the game aren't the best but they are still great, there are some genuine moments of awe when you first enter certain areas or ♥♥♥♥ up certain areas with your dumb actions.

A bit too linear for my tasts but nonetheless, the story accounts for what seems like hundreds of variables and is filled with rich side-quests that actually aren't ♥♥♥♥♥♥.

That seems so till you realise that each faction has it own story & agenda, and it's not just like choosing the flavour for an ice-cream (that is, the cases when it doesn't matter what guild's tattoo you are wearing, you are expected to do the exact same things anyway), here even when going trough the same faction's story again with a differently built char you will find out, much too your own disbelief, that you missed out quite a few more alternative progression paths... and just when you think you've got a good grasp on the workings of politics & intrigues of the world you are visiting you get slammed by bits of 'ingame mythology' telling of demons, angels and the great magic of ages past... yet not all men are created equal, where one sees magic and all powerfull creatures other sees but applied knowledge and a firm grasp of advanced technology... all the while most people around them neither see nor question anything and just choose to 'blindly believe', after all faith is all that's needed for their salvation...\nThen come the superb graphics and attention to details: the game is 'chock-full' of absent art banners and an occasional missing inventory item icon but beyond all that you still have to take a bow to the artist(s?!)' amazing rendering of armours & weapons; fluid combat animations, not to mention the surprisingly well done rendering of roman & eastern architecture you will often encounter...\nOh, have I mentioned the awesome TBS combat mechanics - if you don't know what that means then perhaps you aren't the target audience for this game... (take no offence 'if we all liked the same things this world would be a really small place and the 2 of us would be 2 very busy people'), along with the possibility of crafting your own weapons & armours (yeah, that's way more then just cosmetic and generic choices) and alchemy (of course there are even shroom based mixtures alongside poisons, liquid fire & black powder goodies)... Long story short, you need to see it all to believe it. As if you could see it all... just about any new patch brings more content, balancing tweaks and pokes the fan base for input regarding a new combat mechanic or tweak they would like to implement in the near future.\n\nSo, is it done yet?! What's the ETA, guys?! Will we get it before the Easter bunny does?! Stop asking already and just come play it (there's quite enough content already to keep you busy for ages!) Who knows, you may end up liking it enough to play it for long-long time after 'it's done' and, like myself, never regret purchasing it (you do know there's a free demo just for you?!)

The days before dumbed down shooters became all the rage. A true must own for any hardcore RPG fan.\n\nPlot:\nThe game is set in an alternate world, where a Roman-esque empire had mastered magic. The details have been lost to history, but apparently there was some sort of war that left the world in ruins. Now, hundreds of years later, modern leaders/robber barons have each set up their own little kingdoms and are vying for control over the remnants of the known world, like dogs over scraps.\n\nThe game is well written and filled with ancient secrets, plots, and intrigue - which the player may either ignore or participate in, but it will affect the game regardless. Choosing to help someone be named Emperor could cause someone else to panic and make drastic decisions. Choosing to do nothing might allow certain factions to gain more control than they would have had you intervened. Everything is connected and each choice you make or don't make will probably have some repercussions down the line. It feels really good to make choices that matter and aren't just window dressing.\n\nOverall Gameplay:\nGameplay in this game is LARGELY based upon which skills you pick and which choices you make. A stealthy assassin working for the assassin's guild is going to meet different people and fight different battles than the cunning grifter who gets by on lies and deception. The streetwise thief is less likely to be taken in by the lies of others than a gullible mercenary.\n\nDialog itself might well be considered its own gameplay. Dialog is affected by your skills, but just because your skills give you an option doesn't mean that option is a generic "win button". In fact, different skills will open legitimately different paths and sometimes, a combination of skills are needed in order to achieve a certain outcome.\n\nThe game has multiple endings depending on your choices, so it really is almost as if there are several different games worth of content - and odds are that you won't be able to see all the content in one play-through, so multiple play-throughs are both recommended and enjoyable.\n\nCombat:\nFor those of you waiting for a hardcore turn-based RPG that doesn't pull its punches, the past decade and a half has been full of mixed blessings and downright disappointments. Fans of the original Fallout's gameplay were told that Fallout's combat was "outdated" and Fallout 3 became a yet another shooter with RPG elements. Even the as early as 1999 Baldur's Gate and the infinity engine games gave us real-time with pause gameplay in lieu of actual turn-based gameplay - again with the excuse that turn-based games just wouldn't sell. Well, not Age of Decadence. From day one they've stuck to making a turn-based game for turn-based enthusiasts and they have succeeded brilliantly.\n\nCombat is challenging, varied and - with the right skills and gameplay choices - completely optional. The game is single player, so it's similar to Fallout 1 & 2's turn-based gameplay - albeit with a variety of different moves and items you can use. For example, a fast attack will hit accurately, while a regular attack or a power attack will each do more damage, but be less likely to hit. You can attack multiple enemies at once with a whirlwind attack, or attack arms or legs to either trip your enemy or make them drop their weapon. Also, you can poison your weapons, use ranged weapons, throw nets, bombs or even acid. Different weapons have different options. A spear, for instance, can interrupt an enemy and hit him before he can approach you to attack. A dagger can strike faster and more often than a sword, but a big axe or a spear can strike diagonally. Because of these many options, combat can be just as much about good strategy as it is about stats.\n\nThere are no trash mobs, no rooms full of random enemies whose sole purpose is to slow you down and make the game longer. Each combat encounter is hand-designed and comes about due to the choices the player makes. Were you tricked into following the wrong sort of person into a dark alley? Well, enjoy the fight. Did you murder an Imperial guardsman? Well, his friends are going to want some payback. Did you tell the leader of an enemy army to stick his head between his legs and kiss his own rear end? You get the picture.\n\nOverall I have to say I haven't played a game with this many choices and consequences in a long while. The fact that it has challenging combat is a welcome bonus, though many have said it's too hard.\n\nSo the question is: should you buy this game? Well, if you want your hand held, want to be guaranteed success and don't like reading, I suggest you wait until you are a bit older. To the rest of us who remember an era before player characters would magically resurrect at the end of every battle, before quest compasses let us play the game on auto-pilot, before "combat" meant mashing buttons: I say, welcome home.","March 12, 2014","true","88.4"," 7 of 16 people (44%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","44","7","16","2","0"

I did find some of the frustration in needing to reload to add points to stats at differrent points, but in the end game you can be completely screwed if you didn't invest in one or two certain traits that may have been the complete opposite of your build. And everything that makes this game special, everything people are praising it for in the write ups, goes right down the tubes in the ending.

It's clearly a game where the developers have put effort into in terms of decisions and consquences.  It's also a game that is exactly as it is advertised: really hard and unforgiving.\n\nThat said, I just couldn't get into it Age of Decadence.  I really wanted to enjoy this game, but I guess it's just not the game for me (and, thus, I have a hard time recommending it to others).  While interacting with other characters was fun and I was interested in seeing the impact I could have on the world, the world itself was not particularly interesting or fun.  There is a moment where you feel like the game might encourage and reward exploration, but places outside of the main cities are small and serve little purpose other than their original quests.  It becomes really hard to care about what's going on or your role in it.\n\nThe combat system does not make this any easier.  It's a simple (not in a bad way) system, and the game doesn't lie when it says its very difficult.  It is, but not in a good way.  I don't mind difficult games, and I typically feel like greater difficulty enhances the gameplay experience, but the difficulty here feels artificial and forced.  Losing isn't learning experience that helps you figure out a puzzle, it's just frustrating.  And, consquently, winning isn't particularly rewarding either.\n\nFinally, there's not much to say about the story.  It's not bad, but it's not particularly interesting either.\n\nAgain, the game isn't bad, but can I honestly recommend it to others?  No, I can't.  I wanted a refund but I was 3 hours over the limit, so I guess this review will have to do.

I don't remember anything like it in any other game which raises its value even further. Something fresh for a change instead of another "chosen one rescuing the world and fighing the dragons". I think it would appeal to all A Song of Ice and Fire saga (hopefully someone will tweet it to them :P). Sadly, many people will probably rage quit before they even notice that (or might be too stupid to notice that).\n\n2) Combat. It actually is enjoyable and makes me want to fight instead of mindlessly left clicking on everything that moves (or sends something that moves). The challenge makes it rewarding once you win whereas in Fallout 1/2 you could have defeated almost anyone with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ stats and quick-save->quick-load strategy since even with 0% chance of hitting you could have done a critical hit (on the other hand you could have missed a target from point blank range when using a machine gun and having 95% chance of success). In AoD there isn't a universal strategy for every fight. E.g. when fighting a fast and agile opponent that had very high dodge stats using a smaller but faster weapon was more wise (as it should be). You would never hit him with a big hammer but you would hit him with a small one and since he was so agile thanks to practically no armour it was enough to defeat him. The same goes for spears - for the most time they are a superb weapon because of it's unique properties but there are fights where you're at a disadvantage (closed spaces for example). There are ways to overcome this but it's not like you can have only one weapon (like turbo plasma rifle in Fallout) and defeat every opponent with that.\n\n3) Replayability and  Choices and Consequences. They actually do matter and you can never do every quest in every possible way without replaying the game. And that is a good thing IMO. In Fallout New Vegas for example I did practically every quest there was, investing in speech at first since I knew that I could open safes or hack into computers later. For some reason no one would do it before me. Well, not in AoD. If you won't do quests in Teron someone else will and you can't go back for them. Which makes sense and which makes me want to replay the game. I don't want to replay F:NV though since I've done everything there was to be done and walking for hours was tedious (BTW, that's why I like teleporting, although I won't make a point about it).\nAnyway, it's really well written and it's not as unforgiving as some may think. In Maadoran for example I chose to be a stupid brute (read: mercenary) that worked for Thieves Guild. As it turned out because I've invested too many points in combat and not enough in lock picking/disguise and other thief skills (since I assumed I was a muscle for them, not Arsene Lupin) I couldn't do much at the end of Maadoran when Levir - the leader of the T guild there - asked me to. But that didn't ruin that much since I still had the option to go to Ganezzar. I expected to be executed or something like that but it wasn't the case (which again shows that writer actually thought what he was writing, trying to kill a killing machine wouldn't be the smartest move and in all honesty he had nothing to gain from that but a thing or two to lose). I haven't tried all the options available yet so I might be able to see a different outcome but my point is: you don't have to repeat the game from the start to enjoy it. The game despite being difficult, still gives a player a certain margin of error, big enough to not be frustrating.\n\nThere are more pros (and I should write more on C&C) but I don't have the time right now to write about them. I prefer to play the game a few more times (read 10 at least :P). Once I do I'll write something more. As for cons, besides camera being a bit clunky I have none. And even that isn't that bad once you learn to use middle mouse button (which sometimes doesn't work for some reason and I have to use ctrl+mouse button).\n\nEdit:\n3) You're being guided what to invest in. If you're playing a merchant it's logical that you have to silver-tongued so you invest in speech skills such as streetwise, persuasion and trading. If you're playing as a Loremaster you invest in lore + speech skills, if you're playing as IG or assassin you obviously need comabt skills, etc. First quests show you what you'll need further. But to be honest it should be obvious what merchant or IG need.\n\nGoral Just now\nNot true but since you haven't actually played the game it's no wonder. Looks like you've had the game opened for less than 2 hours for the sole purpose of baseless slating.\n\n1) Even if you fail some skill check you can continue the game easily, you just won't max your character and become a demi-god (which happens if you squeeze every SP from every quest). To me it's refreshing and a nice change when compared to Bethesda games for example where you can become a demi-god no matter what character you make and what decisions you make.\n\n2) If 1 way is closed for you you can be sure that at least 3 more (with different skill requirements) are open. For example to get into an outpost you can either sneak in or kill the guards or impersonate a loremaster or poison the guards or just betray the lord who gave you this quest and switch sides.","December 1, 2013","true","264.8"," 14 of 31 people (45%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","45","14","31","0","0"

I used to think that I was capable of doing what needed to be done in these sorts of games to at least get through each encounter, even if battered and bruised, but to survive to fight another day... I read the reviews beforehand, I thought these were much the same as those for similar games I've completed with just a little bit of forethought, and I thought that maybe I could make it through most of the game without batting an eyelid... Boy, was I wrong...\n\nYou cannot be a jack of all trades and master of none and still hope that your skills will get you through. You cannot hope on blind luck that maybe, just maybe, those guards in the distance will somehow not notice your presence and leave you to your own devices... You cannot enter a potential conflict and think that you'll then be able to talk your way out of it, or that there'll be some saving grace or guardian angel to prevent your inevitable demise... This game is unforgiving... You are useless... You are as if you (yes, you, in the real world sitting there reading this) decided that you would step away from your computer for a few minutes, pick up a dagger, sword, etc., and try to take over the world...\n\nYou are not a god. You are not a champion. You are not even in the running to make the finals of a computer game tournament. You are useless: a random person with no particular ability to do anything, trying to make something of themselves in a world where only the strong can become recognised, and the weak do anything to please so they don't offend those in power. You could simply take up a trade, hoping that taxes don't increase too much, your lord won't restrict the rights bestowed upon you for being their loyal citizen, and, above all, that your city won't be raided by a more powerful army where you'll likely need to forego many of the "luxuries" that you've become used to living in an established settlement. You could do this, but where's the fun in that? If that sort of life suits you, try a real life simulator. If you want to be a god, try any other RPG.\n\nIf not, and you really want to work (and I really do mean work) towards achieving all that you feel is entitled to you, then, perhaps, this game is for you. You won't be able to finish all the tasks put to you. You won't even finish half (I've yet to try the "god mode" listed in the guides, but it seems that this will restrict the story you develop.) My only suggestion (after numerous failed attempts at living in this unforgiving world) is to focus your development on the character choice you make in the beginning. I've yet to determine if this method will be successful in all situations, because even the most eloquent of speakers runs into trouble in this game, but it seems to be your best bet if you truly wish to survive.\n\nPut simply, you will die... Many times... And often at the most inopportune moment... But... To succeed in these situations makes it all the more worth it. A fantastic game, and a credit to the developers. Your survival is up to you. Your life is yours to lose.

The first two sentences are sufficient to show that AoD is not the traditional RPG where god-like characters roam over a Manichaean world. Fortunately the trailer isn’t the best part of the game (bet you can recall some games that it is), and AoD is not the traditional RPG in many other ways.\n\nFirst, the game is realistic: No matter who you are or the sword you have, you can die miserably just by being outnumbered by a common gang. Words have consequences, so being careless with dialogues is not an option (unless you like to reload the game every five minutes).  Think that you will solve problems just by reloading and waiting for a lucky roll of dices? Forget it; there is no place for lucky ones: your success is determined just by skill and ability.  So if you don´t plan and think you will be stuck.\n\nTalking about planning and thinking, a curious thing about the game is that it is so unforgiving that in a certain point you start metagaming to survive. You stop distributing your skill points according to your preferences waiting for what the game will require you to do. You save your skill points because maybe you have to use your persuasion or streetswise when you turn the corner, or maybe you have to sneak to avoid an undefeatable enemy. In most games, all this metagaming would be a bad thing, but in AoD it is a plus, since it is a challenge in itself.\n\nSecond, AoD developers seem to have made a decision of cutting off any filler content. That simply changed my perspective of traditional RPGs and made me see its many design vices. Remember those towns from Oblivion full of people completely irrelevant to the game? In AoD you don’t have to waste your time clicking in every person on the map. Only a few of them can dialogue with you. In addition, you don’t have rooms full of chests that contain only trinkets, encouraging the players to be lootmaniacs. When you find a chest, it is worthy to open.\n\nThird, you don’t have to waste your time on “FedEx quests” (to quote one of the developers) in which you waste absurd amounts of time running from A to B, B to A, etc. If a dialogue mentions you have to talk to somebody, there is an option of automatically going to the place where the person stands. The fact that some players were complaining that this “instantaneous teleport destroys immersion” says a lot about the state of things in RPG gaming nowadays. What does travelling per se adds to the content of a quest in which you have to talk to someone in an already visited place?  I guess what kills immersion is the time spent making repetitive things completely irrelevant to the content of the quest.\n\nAnother innovation is in the writing. Each background leads you to a different quest, but all quests are related to the same events, so that each background makes you see the game in a different perspective.  The massacre of the imperial guards is a big thing from the perspective of an assassin, but it is just an unforeseen bonus in the chess game of the merchant’s guild. The reality of AoD has so many aspects and layers of profundity that gives replaying value another meaning.\n\nOne thing that is also worth mentioning is that there is a down to earth view of the world shared by most NPCs, even when the subject is the forgotten magic (and they will mock you if you make naïve questions). This is in stark contrast with the grandeur syndrome of most RPGs.\n\nThose innovations are not mere improvements based on successful RPG games for PCs, they are in fact innovations of the very RPG genre in games, which is no small achievement. This game slaps in the face of those who think that RPGs are predestined to be silly teenage fantasies made by silly teenage-like adults. It is RPG in its purest and mature form.","August 4, 2014","true","42.6"," 10 of 24 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","10","24","0","0"

The Age of Decadence is the answer.","March 24, 2015","true","14.3"," 9 of 22 people (41%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","41","9","22","0","0"

I have never played a game ANYTHING like this and find the developers approach to be very refreshing and brutally challenging.  This game really makes you wrack your brain at times thinking of alternate solutions to an inevitable confrontation.  The environment this game creates is that of a desperate post apocalypic world plagued by poverty and political conspiracies that sort of looks and feels like the downfall of the Roman Empire.

If your a casual gamer this game probably isn't for you.  Aside from having a rather non-interactive tutorial (except for the combat tutorial that is optional before you actually start the game) it also has a very steep learning curve.  Actually it's learning curve is nearly non-existent.\n\n\nPros\n\nThis is the only game that I am aware of that combat is completly optional.  This allows you to get more involved in the story and character interactions.\n\nCombat isn't simple.  At the beginning of the game a one on one fight is about as much as you can handle.  If you end up against two people it's going to be a decent fight.  If you have to face three I hope you've saved recently because unless you have back-up (which you don't very often depending on your background) You're going to end up reloading.  This adds an element of difficulty that I feel is missing in many games.  You're never going to see a Dynasty Warrior's style hero slashing through 500 enemies in this game.\n\n\nCons\n\nI've found that you pretty much need to play a combat character or a non-combat oriented character.  Trying to do a mix of the two is nearly impossible.  You'll find yourself in situations where you aren't skilled enough to talk your way out of a fight.  And then once you get into the fight you'll end up dying because you aren't strong enough to survive the fight that you weren't able to talk your way out of the game.  I list this as a con, but also find it to be one of the more entertaining aspects of the game.  Trying to strike a balance between a smooth talker and being able to keep yourself alive in a fight, or trying to figure out which non-combat skills your assassin needs to be able to get by without losing his edge and ability to take out his targets.\n\nBiggest flaw I've found in the game is that combat is extremely dependent on item use.  When properly applied a few nets and bolas can make an unbeatable fight a flawless victory.\n\nSummary\n\nOverall an enjoyable game.  Hopefully it will get some tweaks as it progresses and will improve into an even better game.","February 1, 2014","true","12.7"," 7 of 18 people (39%) found this review helpful","39","7","18","0","0"

You will discover an awful lot about this game through simple trial and error, no single character is able to experience everything that this game has to offer in one play through and nor should it!! Too many games nowadays are watered down crap shipped out for the masses to enjoy without any real challenge, this game however breaks that trend and is a return to the way games should be made.... aimed at actual gamers who enjoy beating at game that is made solely to kick your ♥♥♥.\n\nDo not give up after dying the first 20 times, stick with it, tinker with your stats and see what works for you! You will feel a sense of accomplishment when it finally clicks and you are able to progress onto the next challenge in the game.\n\nThe dev team from all i've read about the game seem to be really passionate about their product and are active on the forums, helping anyone and everyone who is struggling or has issues with the game. Great display from their team and one that you do not see much of nowadays with all the awful trash on the market.\n\nI highly recommend this game, if you are a real gamer who wants to use your brain to overcome to the challenges in a game, this game is definitely for you!!!","August 3, 2015","true","24.6"," 6 of 16 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","6","16","0","0"

The very first screen shown for a new game boasts that it will kill your character over and over and over again. This is presumably meant to underscore the grimdark darkness of AoD's post-apocalyptic grimdark setting, in which there is only grimdark. Some do enjoy this; I'm just getting to find it tedious. After a dozen or so character deaths in the game's opening stretch it becomes impossible to care what decisions you make; pretty much every choice can and likely will end horribly, turning the game into a grind of trial and (fatal) error. The storyline and atmosphere are best described as black comedy, but without the comedy. There are no heroes, every major character you meet is a vile ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, yet the game seems to take itself quite deadly seriously even with nobody or nothing worth caring about. There are a variety of choices to make depending on your stats and skills, and the character system looks like it would offer considerable freedom and variety if you could slog through enough of the game to really develop your guy. There just isn't enough substance to justify the meatgrinder this game puts its players through.","December 19, 2013","false","16.7"," 104 of 219 people (47%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","47","104","219","7","6"

The game is difficult, not for new RPG players, I would recommend to people who want a real challenge in an RPG, not something that can be completed first time, but something that really makes you think of your actions and how it affects the world around you.\n\nTo be honest when I first played this game I had my doubts, forced paths didn't seem all that amazing however after time I realised that this is what made the game a good RPG. It will take time for the developers to finish, I am willing to wait, however just remember that this game can be both surprising and challenging at every action you choose, may it be a peaceful, truthful approach or more of a tactful, down to earth approach, any class can be changed to any aspect, from a mighty merchant to a faithful thief. The options you have in this game is so immense, its replay value is outstanding, the amount of things I missed the first time really changed the game the second time through. From tricking an entire religion into believing you are the 'Chosen one', to saving a god trapped in eternal fog, killing anyone who enters it.\n\nFrom an honest review I would rate this a 8/10, its not the best RPG, but its one of the top in my books.","February 6, 2014","true","32.0"," 6 of 17 people (35%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","35","6","17","0","0"

The choices you make have consequences that are not always readily apparent and may cause unforseen consequences that still make sense in the game's world.\n\nThe combat is difficult and subsequentally the game does not give off a hack and slash vibe; you must think carefully before committing to combat. You are no hero in this game, no mighty superhuman foe, but merely a mortal in a very dangerous time in history.\n\nCarry on the good work!","February 25, 2014","true","13.3"," 5 of 15 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","5","15","0","0"

It shows a lot of potential in it's early access condition. That said it is very much an early access game, and not very long. What's more most of what works in the game is entirely social (as befitting some of the game concepts) making it almost like an adventure game, or interactive novel with skill checks, at least as far as I've played it. It could use more in the way of ruins to explore, tombs to raid, and the like. What's more given that several of the character types like Mercenary are very combat oriented in their intended builds I do think some effort should be taken to make them a bit more viable when they choose to fight, especially early on (all jokes aside). What's more the weapons could use some fine tuning, as it seems light weapons like daggers are rather overpowering, at least in the battles I've engaged in so far.

The story is well plotted and most of the characters are interesting. However there is one major issue that makes this game very aggravating. If you are playing a pure diplomat character it is very easy to fail skill checks and have no idea why. Often you will fail a persuasion or disguise check despite having high stats and no clue whatsoever is given as to the reason, which is usually some external stat not mentioned in the text. You will find yourself trying on different clothes, playing with stats only to fail fail fail.\n\nIf this one issue can be addressed during beta I would say this is an almost perfect game.","June 2, 2014","true","5.8"," 4 of 14 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","4","14","0","3"

I bought into the hype and bought the game.  Put plenty of hours into it, and can finally put into words why it drives me insane.\n\nAt first I was very impressed with this game, but now the shine has fallen off and I hate it. I hate it a lot, because it has potential but the devs are so smug and proud of the garbage they've created that it will never ever be fixed.\n\nLet me describe a typical scenario in the game to you. You find a library (from another quest) and go there on your first playthrough (at about the 10 hour mark). In the library is a generator, and your current character doesn't have the stats to fix it. "Alright, I'll just make a guy with those stats on the next play through and find out what this is all about," you think. So you make that guy. You play through mostly the same ♥♥♥♥ again, for 10 hours with your new guy, and get to the library. You pass the skill check, and find out the generator lets you open a secret door.\n\nSo you go through the door and find...nothing. Jack ♥♥♥♥. See there WOULD be something here, but your perception is too low. Perception is decided at character creation, and you can NEVER RAISE IT THROUGH GAMEPLAY. OH, and the only way to know what level you need it at is to read a guide or check online, because the game doesn't tell you...so the surprise is ruined anyways. So now you can either remake AGAIN to try to see this crap, or do what I did and right click -> uninstall.\n\nThe game is FULL of multi-level hard gated skill challenges like this, and sometimes it's totally arbitrary. Combat is very RNG and swingy, which makes save scumming a necessity. Basically it's everything that was terrible about old school RPGs coupled with game devs reveling in the "difficulty" of their game. News flash, that's not difficulty. Trial and error requiring hours of investment between each trial isn't difficulty, and it's sure as ♥♥♥♥ not fun.\n\nI wish I could have figured this out before spending the time on the game I did so I could refund it. Don't fall for the Steam reviews and the hype. Game is ♥♥♥♥, but it shows at least some twinkling of potential...which is why I'm so upset over it. It should have everything I like, but because of the way it's designed it's hot garbage.","December 9, 2015","false","22.8"," 19 of 46 people (41%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","41","19","46","2","0"

I really do.\n\nBut this game has issues. I do not just mean that it has bugs, though it has those.\n\nIts issues are... How best to describe it? Alright... If you like Indie games (and if you don't, you definitely won't like AoD any way, so why even bother looking at reviews for it?) you know that every indie game has some rough edges where you're slightly disappointed at how a little more effort could have made it good, but that you're willing to tolerate because the rest of the game is good and the developer doesn't have a huge budget to work out every kink.\n\nAoD is a game comprised of nothing but those rough edges and that can get really grating. Especially if you've followed the development of this game from the start and know that the reason for this isn't so much lack of budget (though there was never much of a budget) or lack of talent (Vince and co.  are certainly talented) or even bad engine design (Dead State uses the same engine and uses it much better), but simply the fact that with every one of these issues the developers went 'it's good enough for now, we'll smooth it out later' only to never go back and do that because they were busy with the next part.\n\nThat doesn't make it a bad game... Just a very rough gem that never ended up getting the polish it needed (and won't in the future). If you're the kind of person who doesn't get a constant sense of 'this could have been better with just a bit more work' or if you're able to enjoy games despite it, AoD is worth getting. If, like me, you're even more bothered by it than the average person, though, avoid this game and the frustration it brings.\n\nAt the request of several commenters, here are some examples:\n\nThe writing is often far more verbose than needed, while at other times lacking relevant details.\nDialogue options come with heavy consequences without actually having any indication what those consequences are going to be. ("Come into my shop." "Sure" *start inescapable combat that's not winnable for a non-combat built character*)\nEquipment isn't balanced. (fully half the armour in the early game doesn't offer enough protection to balance out its penalties and with the exception of throwing weapons, only one or two weapon types per weapon group are worth using)\nLocation maps frequently only bare a token resemblance to the actual location and navigating locations at the hand of the map is a daunting prospect.\nVarious conversation bugs (or else design flaws) such as the conversation with the group of refugees at the gate not allowing you to talk to gate guards again.\nVarious animation glitches, such as an npc moving and attack whilst still in the 'getting choked by a bola' animation.\nMouse develops a mind of its own when not in fullscreen on a 16:10 monitor.\n\nBut don't take my word for it: Play the demo. It's a good representation of the game as a whole and all its flaws are not just there because it's a demo. Ask yourself if you enjoyed it enough to be willing to go through 20 hours of that. If you are, buy AoD, if you're not, don't.\n\n(Not that it matters that I editted this, because I've noticed the number of 'helpful/not helpful' votes negative reviews for this game get. Seriously, there's negative reviews with 100+ people finding it helpful, the highest voted positive reviews have, what? Less than 30 'helpful' votes, good job gaming the system to keep all negative user reviews off the store page AoD fans. The fact that this is intentional isn't helped by several thread in AoD's Steam discussion forum actively reminding people to do this.).","November 30, 2015","false","1.6"," 11 of 30 people (37%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","37","11","30","0","8"

You have them, you get it. This requires vast meta-knowsledge if you want to expierence at alot and quite some try-and-error that might unfold on you after you sped hours on yourplayhthrough. You must be ok with the idea on seeing it later on yet you might feel like missing someting essential.\n\nCombat is basic. Tere are options yet those are hardly worth it. Also the game does not scale. If you play a fighter character you get encouters that are for other classes entirely skipable or somewhat "challenging" due to skillpoints being in other talents. Yet for a fighter there is no challenge. You build your character right and you will kill everything and that means quite something. The different attack options are also not worth it. Just kill the dudes outright.\n\nDialogues are quite like content and exploring; you have the required skill at a set level and get a choice or you dont. There is not much besides that and options that require these skills are mostly supperior and open up new options. Besides that dialogue is pretty basic. Infact you rarely get choices at all (without skill) so most of the dialogues are pretty much linear. You are in for the ride as I said it. You wont change much.\n\nConclusion: The most important part of the game is the character creation. At this very point you decide what content you can see, access and beat. Dont spend your skill points and raise them as the content you encounter requires yet that does not work for skills. As for the story it may unfold its lore on you, but the more you know the less imporat your actions become and finaly the end is pretty much basic and unsatisfying.","October 16, 2015","false","34.6"," 18 of 45 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","18","45","0","0"

Let's take a look:\n\nThe game isn't actually hard (much to every other reviewers chagrin). Instead, you have to be crafty and calculating. The game forces you into a Game of Thrones-esque universe. It would be sort of fun if you were given multiple ways to handle situations. I like to play RPGs as myself - what decisions would I make in a given situation? But before you have any options, the game forces your character into murderous plots filled with espionage and crooked politics. Once you accept that you'll make Cersei Lannister look like a saint, the game becomes a bit more fun. However, the linear gameplay is somewhat of a bore.\n\n"But Nothing!" another fan says, "how is this game linear with 7 different factions to join/help!" It's linear because you DON'T have 7 different factions to join. You pick one at the beginning of the game, and then you're stuck on-rails to do their bidding. If you fail, there are a small handful of quests that you can do, but they're seemingly inconsequential, or they benefit only one faction. In other words, the game dictates what you do and how you do it, limiting choice.\n\nChoice is further limited by the situations and encounters you have. Since the story is linear and you have only one faction to truly be apart of, your "choices" come down to how you kill someone or advance yourself/your organization. Do you bring some extra muscle and do it yourself? Or do you cleverly convince a group of assassins to do it for you? Either way, that one person is going to die with little to no consequence as to how he dies.\n\nFinally, there is the problem of balancing. This is indirectly related to choice because you have to know exactly what skills to invest in at the beginning of the game based upon the faction you chose. Otherwise you'll find yourself at a critical juncture without the necessary skills to progress. Do you die at this point? Can you reload to reinvest your skills at an earlier save? No. The game just sort of awkwardly stops. It would  be nice if you could try something else. Think of it as a "boss fight", only instead of swords, you fight with words and perhaps a clever diplomatic approach will win the day. But no, you're either given one choice, or both choices involve skill sets that maybe you didn't develop all the way. You'd literally have to restart the ENTIRE GAME just to have another chance at it. That's not fun. It's frustrating. This isn't Dark Souls or some other Rouge-Like, where half the fun in the game is in the mere combat/progression, while the other half might be in a narrative arch. This is a game that is almost purely a narrative, with little to no variation in the story based on your choices (except the all-important choice of which House/Guild you work for at the beginning) - it is nothing but an unnecessary chore to have to replay different segments of the game AGAIN just because the developer made a problem insurmountable.\n\nThat's not "hard". It's just obnoxious.\n\nSo, I can't recommend this game. I definitely would love more games to put less emphasis on combat and more emphasis on diplomacy, but I don't want choice and consequence sacrificed as a result. This is nothing more than a novel as far as I'm concerned. Is the story good? Yes. Does the player have any agency in it? No.","November 8, 2015","false","6.4"," 15 of 39 people (38%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","38","15","39","2","0"

The writing is entertaining, there's ample and well thought out lore that feels immediately relevant, and there's a plethora of dialogue trees and questlines promoting replay. Also, the setting is really intriguing and unique, and making combat inherently risky and more "real" while offering non-combat choices is a refreshing approach.\n\nThat said, the graphics are dated. While the sprites are very well done (the portrait art is some of the best I've seen, full stop) the character models are primitive. I'm not sure how much of that is a limitation of the engine, but I've seen other games using the same engine address that limitation through creative artistic design choices.\n\nThough the writing itself is strong, the storytelling left me a bit cold. If an RPG isn't going to motivate the player by pushing them to level stats or find bigger and better loot, then it has to pull them along by engaging their sympathies with the main character. That never happened for me. It still felt like I was just walking around clicking on things and talking to people because that's how the game moves forward, not because I was motivated to progress along a quest line or for any particular roleplaying purposes.\n\nFinally, and this is the thing that made me give up on the game, there are too many false choices in a game that prides itself on the strength of its dialogue. Many if not most of the conversations felt more like traps than actual role playing, reminiscient of the old "Choose Your Own Adventure" books. They boiled down to, "You see a knife. Do you a.) try to eat it, or b.) stab yourself." Without giving specific examples (to avoid spoilers) one that stands out results in either betraying the person you offered to help or having to fight an angry mob. As a persuasive, streetwise, charismatic trader I oddly never had the option to negotiate, an option I felt wasn't unreasonable to expect and which was my intention when I began the dialogue. I finally ended up simply avoiding the encounter, a choice I found myself having to make too many times through the game. The alternative, which I also exercised fairly often, was reloading until I found the right sequence of responses to progress.\n\nAs I say, I want to enjoy the game, but, frankly, there are too many other RPGs that have addressed the shortcomings here without being excessively "casual".\n\n","May 9","false","14.5"," 7 of 22 people (32%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","32","7","22","2","5"

There are no honest NPCs in this game. SIde quests involve either being robbed, stabbed, or misled, and the main quest involve either murdering people because you were told to or manipulating others to murder each other because you can. Role playing as a decent human being will get you killed very fast. Why would anyone play a game that involve this much reading when you just don't care what happens to any of the in game characters? Blah Blah Blah, House X will benefit if you do this, House Y will benefit if you do that.... So what? They are just as bad as each other, and whatever the ending is, it is definitely a bad ending because none of the factions are ran by decent people.\n\nThis is a old school RPG, so if you want to complete the game you have to either save and reload frequently or read online guides. Compared to other RPGs like Pillars of Eternity and Mass Effect, which can be played blindly with very little reloading and no help from the internet, I feel Age of Decadence is simply inferior because the death and reloading is immersion breaking. It was a business driven game mechanic for the 1 coin for 3 lives arcade machines of the 1980s, but today it just looks out of place. I like permanent death no reload games like jagged alliance 2 1.13, x-com long war, and this war of mine. In those games death matter because you have to keep going and the person you spent hours interacting with is now lost forever. Whereas in this game death doesn't matter because you just reload. This is just bad game design.\n\nThere are other little annoyances, such as font size is too small on high resolution monitors, you are forced to start combat encounters in melee in tiny rooms even if you try to play as an archer, map areas need to be unlocked and you can't free roam, camera angle changes after every text interaction, too many stats are displayed on screen in combat when only chance to hit and damage range actually matter.\n\nIf you have the morality of a typical GTA protagonist and you enjoy tweaking complicated excel spreadsheets, and you don't mind dying and reloading all of the time. Then sure, pick up this game. For everyone else, there is simply a lot more games which are a lot better in storyline, gameplay and game design.","October 15, 2015","false","3.8"," 27 of 65 people (42%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","42","27","65","5","2"

I sucks !! The main thing in the game that should be fix is the odds ! The fact that you can only do quests to level up, that you are limited to what quest offers to level up its funny. If you fight , well make sure to have lots of constitution and action points since otherwise all the attacks will lack. Yet how many time you will miss instead of hitting an enemy. so in some situation where you can't have enough health since health potions are too expensive and your health doesn't regenerate over time which is a big flaw in the game. The point of an indie game is not to try to act like a REAL game, its to keep it old school yet ENJOYABLE, you want people to buy the game, to actually Succeed and follow the story plot. Not to get frustrated because you kill 2 enemy and 1 kills you or if you join him you both get killed by some other enemy. When you start up and can fight one guy at full health, good because you can get gold and get better items, but then you are always over match by the enemy ! You should be able to have a fair fight as your main character and kick ♥♥♥, these games are why people end up making trainers and hacks because they just get annoyingly boring. Yet I'm willing to see if the developpers are smart enough to improve the game !","February 15, 2014","true","14.7"," 4 of 17 people (24%) found this review helpful","24","4","17","0","2"

Enviroment feels very bland and fake.\n- Almost no envrioment interaction like lootables like chests, houses, or desks. Most places are empty with no interaction.\n\n1 combat skill point per combat. Combat skills are upgraded a 5 point inrements. After your initial character build it might take 15 or 20 combat points to raise a combat level like "daggers", "blocking" or "swords".\n\nBad dialog. They didn't even attempt to make it resemble the Roman era. Few dialog options.\n\nVery little to do. No much to explore, very few quests in a very small world with only a few zones.\n\nSince in combat you are nearly always going to go up against 4/1 odds you need to back yourself into a corner to limit the amount of enemeis able to hit you. Not always an option.\n\nIf you leave Teron, the first location without completing certain quests, you lose the ability to complete them. You can go back to Teron but the quests are gone. With so few quests and so few combat points given from combat, losing quests and points because for going to another city just ruins that game. You're forced to reload an old save and try to take on 9 enemies against your one over and over and over until you've beaten it just so you don't lose the XP by completing a SHORT chain quest.\n\nCan't recommend, going to uninstall and never play this again. At least it was on sale and I got 20 hours out of it. Although much of that was idel/on pause.\n\n","October 26, 2015","false","23.8"," 8 of 27 people (30%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","30","8","27","2","0"

The first section basically is you going around town playing gofer randomly being jumped by scumbags.  There is no overland map or outside the villages/cities to travel to if you need to go someplace for a quest it either takes place in one of the couple of towns in the game or you are trasported to the map that you need to go to.\n\nGoing back to the first town from the second doesn't seem possible and I don't remember being warned before turning in the quest that caused my being sent forcibly to the next town.  If you have something to do there before then finish it before turning in any main quests you complete.\n\nMost people bring nothing to the game as they cannot be interacted with.  Most stuff in the game similarly cannot be interacted with.  This makes the maps that do exist feel empty to me.  It also makes some of the skills mostly useless or at least far less so then they could be.\n\nThe movement system is crap, point and click.  There is no free movement with the WASD keys.  Those just control the place that the camera is in the area you are so you can have your character completely off of the screen.\n\nThere doesn't seem to be much in the way to actually craft, not alchemy, unless you find preexisting things and break them down as you don't seem able to purchase raw materials.  You also cannot experiment with stuff and create your own armor and weapons you can only buy the plans.  However you can do that with alchemy, there just aren't that many compounds to find apparently.\n\nThe combat system is ♥♥♥♥ and the character seems overly weak.  At max con you get relatively few HP.  Unless you have high levels of skill in whatever ability you are using they are pretty useless, but not for your opponents.  Most of the noncombat skills are overpriced per level for the amount of use tyou seem to get out of them.  Even at 10 in a skill, which seems to be the max, it can still fail.","February 6, 2015","false","7.4"," 39 of 98 people (40%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","40","39","98","3","1"

For $25, this early access game claims to be the next best thing since RPGs were invented, but falls epically far from that goal. The interface is clunky, ok, it's trying to emulate games of the past - that's fine. The dialogues are dauntingly long, for absolutely no reason. There is no real story about which one might care, and the dialog options often lead to the same conclusion. The character creater shouldn't even exist it's so bad. Nothing about this game feels like I'm in it, like I'm a part of it. The graphics are unimpressive and the dynamics lack fulidity of movement - the whole game feels stiff. Not sure if it's far from finished or what the deal is, but I found my expectations were not met, in pretty much any way.

If you enjoy save-scumming over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again just to pick that ONE right dialog that doesn't get you killed or fighting 30 people alone, this is the game for you. If you want an open-ended non-linear RPG that breaks the mold and does something different, wait for another game.","October 18, 2015","false","34.6"," 9 of 34 people (26%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","26","9","34","4","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RightousMan/recommended/230070/","RightousMan","Right0us_Man","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RightousMan/","133 products in account","EDITED\n\nMy original review and following forum post titled I WANT A REFUND, are all coated in a nice layer of hatred for this game, a need to get my money back at the time, and fustration with the way the game plays, not to mention the fans and just wanting to be an @$$hole to them because I could.\n\nI am officially apologizing for my hostility and rampant anger that is easily seen in my posts as time goes on on the discussion board. I'm also sorry for saying the devs are liars, although the store page isn't entirely truthful as to what type of game this is overall.\n\nMy attitude and tone was uncalled for and I should have approached it all with a different point of view, but after having fans simply repeat the same things over and over to me on the forums I eventualy just had enough and blew up to end the discussion on my end. They of course kept going for a bit. Rabid dogs that they are. That said I've learned some things from my time with this games community, rather than the game itself.\n\nOne thing I learned is that Game Devs on steam, cannot force steam to give your money back. The dev offered, because he didnt want my money and didnt want me as a customer. This was the entire purpose of my original post, i figured if I made a stink I could get my money back. I was wrong and my tone was over the top and I shouldn't have posted it.\n\nHowever, I'm still not recomending buying this game. First off, two things.\n\n1- The Dev that makes the replys for this page, Vince. Mainly seems to respond to negative reviews, with a list of links he has at the ready to provide you with information you cannot get from playing the game yourself and rather must exit the game and go to a website in order to learn to play the game " the way its meant to be played ".\n\nAlso from many of his responces on other reviews, it seems his main goal is to immediately discredit the reviwer by suggesting that you have missed the proper way to play the game entirely and are infact making a review without having full knowledge of the game. Unless your review is a thumbs up in that case he hardly seems to respond at all. This is something I noticed after reading some of the other reviews and seeing his replies there.\n\n2- My times with the fans of this game, The fans of this game are quick to defend it and I wont call them out for doing so, as we all defend things we like. Their harshness towards me is the standard dribble that I delt to them eventually. The only thing I can say that was above and beyond on their part is that eventually one or two of them took it upon themselves to use my real name and insult me. I never used any of their real names, or even used Vinces' name. that type of behaviour is stalker ish. Be warned if you choose to leave a review for this game as the fans will attack you ferociously and the devs wont really stop them at all. In a way they seem to encourage this behaviour.\n\nNow for the review.\n\nThe graphics for this game are quite dated and if you find yourself, like me, becoming something of a graphics ♥♥♥♥♥ as the ages pass you by then you may also have a issue with this.\n\nThere is really no point in designing a character as that aspect of the game is almost not there at all. The camera angle further elemenates any need for customization. Armor, clothing and weapons are the main thing that will change the appearance of your character.\n\nThe game bosts that all of its quest lines are hand written along with all their encounters. And while I admit thats a good thing.. arn't all quest lines in most rpgs hand written? In that someone wrote them? I mean thats not really a game feature at all, untill i see more and more rpgs using nothing but randomly generated quest and sotrylines I cannot call this a game feature, because it isn't.\n\nThe game boasts a hard core choice based storyline that branches into other storylines based on your choices. This is true but at the same time it isn't. From my time with the game; which I admit is limited given i never made it past the 2nd town; All i saw was skill based choices. there are very few choices that are not skill based that I saw that had any effect on anything. The only time this became true was during a mission where i could betray my choosen guild. And even if you disagree with me on this point, the end game of these storylines ( which calling them branching storylines is a bit of a stretch honestly ) is often the same, only changing for some major plot points and disreguarding the vast majority of your actions that lead up to that event.\n\n26 hours. Thats how much time i put into the game, the fans often said to me that asking for  refund after 30 hours is stupid and that I was stupid for not playing the demo. Well as it turns out I never had a ragequit problem untill I got to the 2nd town and basically got to the mid point for my guild questline. So no matter how many hours i played the demo for, I would have never gotten to that same point as it was not included in the demo ( this is going off what the fans have said, that the demo is the entire game, just only the first town. )\n\nAlso I just cannot judge a rpg within 2 hours. I played it for as long as I did and then I had my judgement. It unfortunite that steam has a 2 hour policy and a auto review of those refund requests. Heck I still want my refund of sid Meiers Pirates, because it wont run anymore.\n\nThe straw that broke the camels back.\n\nI ran into a fight where the placement for my character for said fight was simply unforgivable. Normally this isn't really a issue as combat can be hard or very hard in some rpgs, but not in the same was as AoD. This game makes everything seem like a extra effort, i dont enjoy the way combat unfolds, the turn based system isn't the problem. I just dont like how you choose your combat actions. I feel that even with this GUI they could have gone with something that felt less restrictive. My view of combat is also tainted as I died so many times in the first town that I eventually made a min max character and was able to move forward, giving up any hopes I had of having a combat savy, talker or some other combination that isn't just nothing but one type of combat.\n\nAnyway, in said combat I was forceibly placed into the center of a room with 3 or 4 enemys. My character knows there are multible people in the room, as is suggested by the text leading up to entering it. Even knowing this the way the choices are written, you just enter it anyway, rather than allowing the player to apot for a ambush at the chokepoint. What is really funny about this being the combat that made me ragequit is that, up untill that point I felt I finally had the game figured out adleast enough to allow me to explore and simply die over and over. While its true I always had the option to run away and abandon the quest, doing so basically makes your character a wanted man and prevents you from progressing your factions missions forward. While running away is always a options and while my pride didn't at the time allow me to do so, I still felt like I was being rail roaded into this situation and just freaking hated it.\n\nOften times that is how the game feels. Some people may enjoy a game that provides no hand holding at all and practically forces you to exit the game and learn to play it by watching videos online and reading pages and pages of character build stratagies. I'm not one of those people and if that aspect of the game had been made much clearer on the store page for the game I wouldn't have ever bought it to begin with.\n\nIn short this game heavily reminds me of my original Dungeon master for 3.5 dnd. He was the kinda guy who says, the wall attacks you and also foundly enjoyed dropping bombs on players like, " I'm sorry but you never specifically said you were getting that item, so even though without it your all about to die, I dont care. " This game and its choices all feel like I have no freedom at all.","April 10","false","26.4"," 3 of 21 people (14%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","14","3","21","3","7"

The main issue is the core mechanics of gameplay- combat is so brutally difficutly that it is not at all enjoyable. I know a lot of people are writing reveiws saying this is a throw back to old school games. I dissagree- this is poor game design. Besides fighting your other option is to play a non combat character, which is the optimal choice, since combat is clunky, not intuitive, and not at all forgiving.

In that hour experienced multiple crashes, when transitioning to combat or a new area. The game was not what i expected truthfully.\n\nOne of the eight ‘vignette’ stories(drifter) starts out with your journey begining in some random town and there is a fight outside your inn room. Thats it.... you end up finding a treasure map on a dead inn keeper. From there you take that map to an antique collector who offers you some kind of amulet that is supossed to glow when you get close to the treasure. Terrible story but the writing isnt bad, in a tale about people who destroyed the world and no ancient evil i didnt expect a glowing amulet that seems akin to magic. Story woes aside you start in a small town that you can explore. I hope more effort was put towards the other 'vignette' stories.\n\nOn a side note i found out from the developer i was conned by the amulet dealer so i should have stuck with my gut and thought something was off with a magical amulet. Honestly thats a pretty cool feature i guess but not enough to keep me playing however.\n\nThe graphics and art design arent great but in this kind of game, gameplay and combat are more important. I just wanted to mention graphics quality is not on par with the likes of Pillars of Eternity or even Shadowrun. Obviously the budget of these titles is very different but i would like to draw attention to the prices. Shadowrun Hong Kong (19.99). Pillars of Eternity (44.99). Age of Decadence (29.99). Now isnt price and total gameplay (in terms of hours of course) the most important thing to consider? $10.00 more than shadowrun and $15.00 less than Pillars of Eternity is exspensive for an indie game with a shoestring budget compared to the former multi-million dollar games.\n\n\nThe starting town feels empty. You cant talk to anyone but merchants and some quest givers/ quest completers. When you wish to travel to a new area you pull up your map and click on it, fast travel ensues. The game immediately made me think of a visual novel, which isnt a knock by itself as i have played and enjoyed quite a few visual novels. However this game has a steep pricetag for what it offers.\n\nCombat is turn based and in the few battles i was able to particpate in without crashing, tactics were to get up close to the enemy and swing until one of you is dead. Your character has the ability to select different attacks depending on the weapon he is weilding. For example an overhead strike with a broadsword. The different attacks do different levels of damage, consume different levels of AP, or have different chance to hit. There is also the ability to aim at places like your opponents legs to cripple mobility, or do some sort of whirlwind strike that hits multiple opponents. Other tidbits of action like sneaking and stealing are all calculated based on your skills. For example in one quest you can sneak into a ruin, to do so its all skill based you click sneak in the conversation window and sneak past the immediate guards. Than you click sneak again to get into the tunnel, if your sneak skill is high enough again you succeed. Gameplay really seems lackluster as i anticipate random skill checks for almost everything you want to do in this game.\n\nCharacter creation is pretty bland there are a few options to make your character look different maybe 5 hairstlyes and a  few hair colors and skin colors. Other than that there is a list of skills and attributes which arent sufficiently explained to a new player. There is your average attribute system and a list of combat skills and non combat skills. Investing in combat attributes unlocks combat skill points that you can distribute and so on. The character skill system seemed very deep to me on the surface but because of other parts of the game i was not able to delve into it and enjoy it.\n\nAll in all i have played and enjoyed many cRPGs but i cant recommend this one. Many crashes, terrible combat and gameplay, not very good story and the graphics are very indie scene as well, though i would excuse the graphics if the game had anything else fun about it.\n\nI would also just like to note that while some fans of the game believe that in order for me to write a negative review i must slog through 5-10 more hours of boring gameplay that is not reasonable. In the first hour of gameplay after experiencing multiple crashes and encountering other issues i switched to a game i actually enjoyed again.","August 31, 2015","false","1.2"," 28 of 83 people (34%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","34","28","83","4","23"

Ignore a lot of the fanboy reviews -- there are a lot -- and pay attention to common complaints in other reviews.  Basically, this game is very short.  You will spend the majority of your time metagaming and savescumming.  The loading screen is kinda cool looking, so it has that going for it.  Combat is simplistic and often boils down to trying to get 5 or 6 heads or tails coin tosses in a row.  If you don't, you need to reload.\n\nCharacters are standard archetypes.  Don't bother trying to roleplay anything more than standard classes.  The developers should've probably just made Talker, Fighter, and Thief buttons during character creation and not bother with allowing players to allocate stats, since there's really only the illusion of choice.\n\nI was hesitant to get this game because of the negative reviews calling it little more than a choose your own adventure book (Talker), a silly RNG-fest (Fighter), or both (Thief).  You can try to make your own guy, but it just means you'll have to savescum more combats or metagame more skill checks and still risk getting essentially stuck.\n\nThe developers and many of the fanboys will keep repeating 'this game is not for everyone'.  No, it's not.  No games are.  Unfortunately, that's not enough to excuse things like incredibly simplistic combat, a role-playing game that relies on metagaming (ferreal...) or a game that has none of what makes many CRPGs so fun -- exploration, story, character development, and engaging writing and lore to name a few.\n\nIt had some potential, but there's way better stuff out there to bother with this.

If you like *everything* about old isometric CRPGs like Fallout, including the chunky isometrics, the terrible merchant pricing balance, and the comical combat difficulty(not difficulty as in brutal or high skill cap, difficulty as in artificial) level that physically requires you to minmax the hell out of your stats to be remotely viable against the very common scenario that is 3+enemies attacking your lone character at once, then this is a game for you.\n\nThe Devs had a chance to make a landmark CRPG and add another foundation block in the rebuilding of the genre into something modern. The lore and writing is on point, but they decided to snub casuals(read: people who don't like reloading ten times per battle) with really high dialogue skill checks and no middle ground in character creation. Your characters are either autistic savants that are good at three things and completely incapable or worse at everything else, or you're not going to be able to make it very far into the game. Throw in extremely nuanced, vestigial skills like Trading(should be either or a combination of Persuasion/Charisma modifiers), Etiquette/Streetwise(Not useful enough to represent individual skills, and Streetwise is just Street Etiquette), and Impersonate(I can think of two ways to represent disguise more naturally than it's own vestigial skill and I've only put a half minute of thought into it), middle of the road everyman characters with one or two interests or specialties are simply not a possibility.\n\n\nTL;DR: This game is a faithful throwback to the 'golden age' of CRPGs with an alluring atmosphere and competent writing, but it's gameplay is not an improvement over titles around two decades old. Age of Decadence suffers from the same playability/skillbloat issues as the classic games that it emulates, which is exaclty what a few but not most people are looking for, and exactly why the genre died.","October 8, 2015","false","36.7"," 16 of 58 people (28%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","28","16","58","6","8"

I gotta say, I'm disapointed. No "playable" game should be this hard right off the bat, at least not without difficulty settings. I read a note from one of the developers that made me think they must be totally out of touch with how 90% of people play games. They said that the best way to play this game was to play till you get to a fight, and if you can't win regardless of tactic, simply start a new game. Really? No one should ever expect to make a decent amount of money if they make a game that can't be played all the way through without starting over. That is just crappy developement and a total failure to sympathize with the gamer.\n\nStarting from the first location in the game, as is standard, there are quests and things in this location. So you find a few, and quickly discover that there are several you simply can't complete without advancing your stats, some to LEVEL 4 or 5 for that one stat, at 10 points a level. And you only earn about 2 points per body, sometimes not even that. You VERY quickly run out of people to kill, so as far as I can tell, it's not possible to raise all the stats you need, to the level required, in order to complete all the quests you get in the first area. This, in my opinion, is just stupid sauce. Who makes games that require you to leave side quests unfinished?\n\nAnd who makes a game where, once combat starts, you have ZERO methods of gaining back any lost HP, until all combat is over? I think there might be some potions that you can make later on in the game that will do this, but with the standard healing salve either 11 AP isn't enough to use it, or the game simply won't let you use it in combat. Again, stupid sauce.\n\nI've played this for 2 or 3 days, logged several hours, completed every "side quest" possible in the first location. By "possible" I mean the side quests you could complete with the stat points you earn by finding every single hostile person in the town and killing them. I found the gang in shanty town, I found the merchant that leads you to an ambush, etc. At 40 HP with 11 AP the outpost is certain death even after you poison them with the poison you get from the assasins guild (better than rat poison). You can't bluff your way in without rasing 3 different stats to level 4, so that's a no go, no way to earn that many points. I didn't try the bandit camp yet but that's next. I thought I might get more points if I ask for more assassin contracts but the 3rd one advances the game so you are no longer in the first location when it's done, so any side quests that involve buildings in that town are gone, unless you can somehow go back later and the guard won't be hostile to you.\n\nNo game should have it's own "for dummies" guide before it's even released, the fact that someone felt the need for one should be a big clue as to the games apeal.\n\nSo, I gotta say, like I said at the beginning, I am dissapointed. This game needs MAJOR "playability" improvements before it's ready for prime time. From what I'm reading in the developers comments and their game philosophy, I predict that this game is going to be a massive failure. As it exists right now, it should fail.","March 11, 2014","false","10.5"," 47 of 133 people (35%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","35","47","133","2","4"

It's got everything I want in an RPG, except that it's too bloody difficult. The developers are selling me a game where I'm supposed to have multiple ways to beat quests, and I can get down with that. I chose to be a dude with a big two-handed sword who was street-wise and could talk without embarrassing himself. I wanted to live that character. But my dude both can't talk and can't fight past the first quest.\n\nSo I re-rolled a better talker and gave him heavy armor and a tower shield. He's more survivable now, and he can talk even better. Still can't beat the first quest.\n\nThe only way to beat the first quest is to do a bunch of talking and skulking, and so the game doesn't deliver on its promise. Maybe you don't want me to feel like a bad-♥♥♥ dude, but I DO want to feel like a bad-♥♥♥ dude. I even went out of my way to poison all of the guys in the first real encounter and they STILL kicked my ♥♥♥ despite being "so feverish as to barely be able to stand up".\n\nSo, no, I don't recommend this game. I'll come back when I see a patch that addresses this and a sale for 50% off.","October 14, 2015","false","12.9"," 13 of 54 people (24%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","24","13","54","4","6"

It might have a great story, but it hides behind a really clunky interface.\nA UI where doing the simplest things is a puzzle in itself.\n\nIt's not that the game has massive complexity (it has some) most of the complexity comes from the bloody awful UI you have to fight with to do the simplest thing. To hear people call the effort to fight with a bad UI "depth of gameplay" has  raised a chuckle.\n\nA few years back I mastered Dwarf Fortress because I knew the game depth behind that godamawful interface was worth it. And it has been.\n\nIn this case it's mostly story,  I'm not really into pre defined stories (prefer sandbox over theme park every time)\nI would give it a middle option "level thumb" if that was available, but if I have to choose from up or down, I choose down.\n\nBut If story is everything for you? Then give this a go. It's probably ok.\n\n","October 14, 2015","false","0.3"," 11 of 50 people (22%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","22","11","50","2","0"

I do enjoy several features of the game such as choice makeing a diff in the outcome of the way you play the game or the game plays you in such a fashion one could say. I think the dialog is verywell done and in-depth but the graphics are extremely sub par and, the simple fact that the camera when in free motion does not follow the character draws away from the experience of the game. Another thing that really botherd me was the board/map, they should have made the game a large "expansive" open world wich they clearly would have no problem doing with the amount of pollys displayed ^^. On that note it just seems to me as if they were lazy and did not feel like adding that depth to the game. Aswell I would be criminal if I did not mention the frequent crashes I exp on my journey and, Yes most regretable when there is no auto save. So 2/5 for me I would not reccomend you try this game untill the price comes down and they iron out the bugs.","November 28, 2013","false","7.0"," 41 of 129 people (32%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","32","41","129","2","0"

Clunky interface, boring story progression, you don't even get to move your character, you select from a menu what your next action is (enter a door, search a body, etc..) and the scene goes to a new screenshot. Don't be fooled by the screenshots. The pretty ones are not gameplay shots.
