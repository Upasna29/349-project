You'll most likely not have heard of Apeiron, the developers, either. It's one of those obscure Russian titles that have been released in Russia for a few years, and had many years of delay to get a translation going.The main focus of the game is tactical team based combat. It takes a lot of elements straight out of the Jagged Alliance series. A big difference is the lack of turn based combat. Everything is completely real-time, with a twist. You can set events at which moment the game can pause, zoom in on the event, show a shortcut and have a popup. . Because one or two seconds can literally mean life or death, it's quite handy to be able to hand out orders on the millisecond.Besides micromanaging the orders on the field of battle, there is also the micromanagement of your inventory and loadout. You can carry backpacks, belts with extra pouches, tactical vests, armored vests and you can throw a weapon or two around your neck.The game features approximately 225 weapons, and although some of these weapons are variants of another one, you'll probably never get bored of them. The combat can be really intense. You and your band of fearless mercenaries are often, if not always, outnumbered. This is where superior equipment, superior tactics and quick saving comes into play.The game is pretty poorly optimized, and suffers from a horrible memory leak that the developers have, apparently, been unable to fix.You'll also come across a bug or two that will render a quest broken, as the guy you needed to kill or escort out is stuck in a ceiling. It might be funny at first, but it can quickly become frustrating.  The voice acting is atrocious, as well. Fortunately, you can drag the speech slider down to 0. If you were into Jagged Alliance or the UFO series, then you should probably give this a go.\n\n","September 15, 2014","true","4.0"," 53 of 59 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","53","59","0","1"

In fact, it was released in 2009, so don't expect up-to-date graphics. Its gameplay is what makes this game unique. It's the most realistic tactical simulator in the world. The closest example is new JA.\nSecond strength of 7.62 High Caliber is guns. There are tons of guns (pistols, assault rifles, shotguns, smgs, machine guns, rifles, sniper rifles) and lots of attachements (scopes, colimators, laser sights, flashlights, grips, grenade launchers).\nSo, if you are looking for realistic tactical simulator with enormous  range of guns - this is the game.\n\nP.S.

It has much of the deep modelling that JA2 had that very few recent tactical games have had, e.g. new XCom - which was a great game, but didn't do as much to sate the micromanagement itch of obsessively modelling character states and subtle differences in ammunition types. Lots of weapons and weapon-related stats.\n\nAlso very tough, as it befits the genre. The stunning mechanic when being hit and the adrenaline mechanic that penalizes your accuracy when there's a lot of near misses flying around as well as other mechanics make life very challenging when outnumbered (which is pretty much always). Even fairly novice characters will hit targets at optimal weapon range if left alone, so you really need a plan to be successful in game.\n\nGame has some stability issues (save often - though you'd do that regardless), some interface issues and a plot that doesn't really make sense, but it's also incredibly fun for those who like the JA2 mechanical formula and are compulsive about micromanaging for tiny advantages.","May 13, 2014","true","84.6"," 31 of 32 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","31","32","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Whiteswart/recommended/289890/","Whiteswart","Whiteswart","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Whiteswart/","1424 products in account","One of the three Apeiron games, famous with their game engine, made exactly for squad-based tactical wargames simulations. Recently it was updated with Hard Life community mod, which optimised some of game's features and edged to maximum its strong and weak sides.\n\nIn short, I can suggest and propose that game only to quite small cohort of true fans of tactical squad-based games a-la "Jagged Alliance". In fact, community-upgraded versions of 7.62 and Brigade E5, another Apeiron game, are probably the most capable successors and inheritors of Jagged Alliance good fortune (along with just a few more titles, like Silent Storm and some more).\n\nSo. You take the command over small group of mercenaries, merged into another domestic war in small 3rd-world country. You manage guns , tons of them, equip vests, scopes and other tacticool little things which make you a bit more ready-for-anything... And you constantly engaging in some fierce shootouts, where you need to use all your tactical skills and the best of luck, to stay alive for another day. Fight, collect trophies, rest, find a new quest for your squad, get to the new location, goto 10 - the golden formula from Jagged Alliance. If you're still reading, guess you already know all that drill.\n\nNow, what's the special about Apeiron engine and game in general?\nFirst, it is NOT turn-based, it is using smart-pause real-time pattern instead. You could have seen that in the recent "remake" Jagged Alliance: Back in Action, but trust me, it was only spoiled there. Apeiron created, up to the moment, the most complicated and advanced engine to perform a gunfight between small squads. Ballistics, lines of sights, variable reliefs and layouts, combat interferences, contusions - just name it - it is there.\nSecond, if we don't speak about engine, but overall game's features instead - sadly, it is weak, at best. Lame scenario, questionable and obscure quests and so on. If you're coming to the game not just for refined tactical simulation, that's not the right project. I can suggest to look for the next Apeiron game, Marauder, as there will be at least some of plot, narrative motivation and other things we're usually expecting from the complete game, as of the any piece of art.\n\nAs of conclusion, 7.62 is a niche product, connoisseurs of the tactical combats only. The gameplay is about tune your gear, shoot some folks, rince and repeat. Guns-adorers would find many satysfaction there, with all charts, graphs for hundreds of various tools of death. Normal players, who are not ready to shift all those irons hours after hours and then perform one battle, about 2-3 minutes of "clear" time, in another dozen of hours, with every second micromanagement fixes, saves and reloads... Normal players will be either bored from the first look, or drained and exhausted, when with all time needed to finish another Call-of-Duty project, they only (probably) manage to clear the first village there...\n\nAs of my mark, usually I'm not high about projects where so many gameplay parts are obviously ill-performed. But, with 7.62, with all community support... It is worth my 8/10 mark, as I'm really like squad-based tactics and guns, and this is one the best on given patterns.","March 31","true","148.6"," 34 of 38 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","34","38","0","1"

On one hand it's a game that's just overflowing with massive flaws. The graphics are ♥♥♥♥, a ♥♥♥♥ ton of buildings are copied and pasted (seriously, every town has the same damn hospital and bar), the UI is pretty unintuitive, and the game is buggy as ♥♥♥♥ and prone to crashes.\n\nStill though, it's a game that's just bursting with ideas. The inventory is complex and rather interesting. You want to be able to do more than just sling a rifle/shotgun over your shoulder and carry a pistol and some other stuff in your pockets? Well guess what, buddy, you're going to need more than your pants and a t-shirt to do that. Get yourself a vest, bandolier, backpack, whatever if you want to store more gear. You just unloaded a bunch of loose shells from a shotgun and shoved them down your pants and now they're taking up a bunch of room. What are you going to do about it? Get a box for those shells of course! Uh oh, you just ran ou of ammo for your handgun in the middle of combat and need to reload it! Wait, what are you doing with that box of bullets? You don't just put bullets in a handgun! You put bullets in the magazine and then you put the magazine in the handgun silly! The inventory system just pays so much attention to even the most minute details that it's just awesome. It also helps that there's a ♥♥♥♥ing ridiculous amount of items, weapons, and miscellaneous ♥♥♥♥ you can get.\n\nThen there's the combat. To put it simply, getting shot ♥♥♥♥ing sucks, as it should. There's no standing out in the open soaking up damage while mowing down enemies. You get shot, it really ♥♥♥♥ing hurts. Your character can bleed out. Your character can go into shock. Your character can pass out. Your character can drop his gun. Your character can just drop dead from that shot altogether. The same can happen to the enemy too though. I've yet to see any gore but the game's still incredibly morbid in terms of how it manages damage. I've finished quite a few fights where a few bandits and marauders who were mortally wounded just ended up succumbing to their injuries as I finished off their companions. Despite the lack of gore and copious amount of blood you see in games going for some sort of shock value, it manages to deliver the same amount of gruesome carnage and satisfaction games like Dead Space strive for.\n\nIt's a game that's had a lot of heart and thought put into but it just doesn't feel like it had the budget to support all the great ideas it had wanted to share. If you can look past the copious amounts of technical issues, dated graphics, constantly copied and pasted structures, and poor user interface you'll find a game with quite a lot of potential. It's a shame I can only vote yes or no because this is one of those games I'd definitely just give a "maybe"","July 31, 2014","true","4.2"," 22 of 22 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","22","22","0","0"

Sometimes you'll want a pistol, other times a SMG or carbine, and others a full-size rifle, sniper rifle, or machinegun. It depends on the situation you find yourself in and how much time you have to prepare. It's a great change from games like Jagged Alliance 2, where rifles were always the best choice. Even in the late game, it pays to have a pistol available.\n\nIf you're looking for a game that punches you in the face with realism, 7.62 isn't perfect but it's probably the best game out there.

Babremov","http://steamcommunity.com/id/30magazineclip/","121 products in account","(Note, this review is for Brigade E6: 7,62 High Calibre with the Hard Life Addon)\n\nIn a nutshell: ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Блять\n\nIn depth: 7,62 Hard Life is a 100% slav-certified content and mechanics overhaul to the slavtastic CTD operating-operationally Real-Time-With-Pause simulator Brigade E6: 7,62 (yurop and ,'s instead of .'s) High Calibre (or just 7,62 High Calibre in some locales). There's more than enough real life firearms and things that want to be firearms to satisfy even the greatest of autists and here's a real game that lets you live out your innawoods fantasies, removing kebab with obrez, RPG-7V and RPK and making Mikhail Kalashnikov (PBUH) proud from his home in vodka-heaven.\n\nWeapons have relatively realistic ranges, such as shotguns with slugs, flechettes or 00-buckshot having more that five inches of effective range and Jamal's AKM being able to hit people even at 100 yards given enough dakka used. Everything from ♥♥♥♥-diddly ♥♥♥♥ grip Makarov-PM in steel case 9x18mm to ivan YES 7.62x54mmR glorious russian have their own effective ranges, but rounds fired still go places, and that includes places you don't want them to go. If you don't follow the four cardinal rules of firearm safety you are going to make Jeff Cooper cry and hit some poor mexican peasant because you FORGOT TO BE AWARE OF WHAT'S BEHIND YOUR TARGET.\n\nYou can also tacticool many weapons to your inner-operator's content, like adding suppressors (which you have to find the proper caliber ones for your guns), lasers, flashlights, night-fighting equipment, bayonets, grenade launchers, KAC masterkeys, optics in red-dot, reflex, combat scopes, sniper scopes and so forth of multiple actual brands, models, sizes and mounts. Yes, unless you get the proper adaptors, your weaver rail mount ♥♥♥♥ will NOT go on your factory stock AK-74M. Rifle is fine, comrade. Different types of magazines fit in similar guns, like FAL magazines fitting in FAL derivatives, 75-round RPK drums fitting in regular AKMs, Beretta M951 mags going into Beretta M9s, etc. Basically every weapon, type of ammo, grain of dirt, etc. in the game has information on it, and firearms especially have stats like weight, accuracy at various ranges, durability, aftermarket acceptance, balance, rate of fire, time-to-ready and so forth that you have to pay attention to when you decide which one(s) work best for your various mercs and characters. If I haven't convinced you yet that this game is maximum operator yet then I don't know what will.\n\nAnother 'tistic aspect is that even the individual rounds of ammo play a part, with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ locally produced rounds having crap gunpowder and thus less velocity and less penetration, and top-tier FMJ or HP rounds from actual arsenals being the go-to for operating. Thus not only is it important to nab clean, reliable firearms and magazines that aren't beat up, it's also important to keep those mags loaded with good ammo or you're going to be jamming so hard you'll think you're at a punk rock concert. Basically, there's a lot more mechanics-wise in the game than you'd think and the manual only tells you so much, and unless you can read slav runes (Russian) the forums aren't really going to help you too much.\n\nThe game itself has rather unique mechanics, being real-time with pause and all. Instead of other turn-based tacticool games like Jagged Alliance, 7,62 has everyone take their actions simultaneously, with all actions measured in seconds, with hip-fire shots taking less time and shots-through-optics taking much more. This does make things like soloing fights more viable, as instead of shooting one poor ♥♥♥ mook every turn and then being buried under a pile of incoming fire when it's the enemies' turn, you get to blap blap Jamal and Paco continuously as they ♥♥♥♥ their pants and fire their glock-40 problem solvers sideways, making things like cover, concealment and proper positioning all the more relevant. Fights can and will be determined based on who has the drop on who, and you actually have to pay attention to force multipliers like suppressive fire, optics, numbers, good positioning and so forth, or die in extremely painful for you ways. Grenades track individual fragments from the explosion, different types of ammunition can be loaded in the same magazine, the NIJ rating of body armor actually matters, shooting someone in the arm is less likely to kill them than in center mass, etc.\n\nThere's also a lot more into the game like finding, maintaining and inevitably losing cars (seriously, the breakdown rate on some of them is atrocious), maintaining your firearms (i.e. if you don't know the exact sequence to disassemble an M14 off the top of the top of your head you're screwed unless you have a cleaning kit), cleaning your ammo, keeping fed and watered, making sure to sleep so you don't go into shock for 5 minutes because you got grazed by .22LR, actually making sure to talk to everyone you meet or else you don't get the best results for quests, killing people you don't like, making weapons caches and pretending you're a mexican drug cartel, spending far too much time and money trying to keep your cars fuelled and fixed, and much much more.\n\nStory-wise the game gets kinda weird. Basically you're sent into a banana republic after you just got done ruining the neighboring banana republic (in Brigade E5: New Jagged Union) and you're being paid to find some slav thief who tried to steal money from a buncha Russian banker dudes, kick his balls in and bring him or proof of his death to your employers for lods of emone. If you play Hard Life (which comes with the base game as a separate game on Steam and is in my opinion a lot better, if not harder) then you start out in the camp of a buncha commie-wannabe revolutionaries and you have to fight your way to begin the actual main storyline.\n\nRegardless, along the way you get to work for the gommies or the gubmint, suck ♥♥♥♥♥ for firearms licenses (just like in New York), start a peasant rebellion, help out a bunch of hapless average Joes and kill more people than Simo Hayha and Vasili Zaitsev combined. You can work alone or hire a bunch of mercs who charge far too much for their services and even with a bunch of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ AIs every now and then. You can make money by killing bandits and rebels and selling their ♥♥♥♥, opening up a gun store, taking over and running a gold mine, smuggling liquor and gold ore between two countries and so much more.\n\nThere are downsides to having this much slav magic packed into one game, though. The game crashes so often you could probably record it on dashcams and make a Youtube compilation on it, the voice acting (what little of it you hear) is terri-bad, being a Russian game and all (think Men of War tier, just not THAT bad), a lot of the game, especially in Hard Life, remains either untranslated from slav runes or consists of Google-translate tier bad work. Enjoy having your magazines labelled "clips" half of the time and "magazines" the other half. There's very little documentation so many of the game mechanics will be figured out through trial-and-error, reading guides or forums, crying like a ♥♥♥♥♥ or hoping to the vodka god that things work. There's also a lot of glitches, some of which are potentially game or quest breaking, and if you play Hard Life it's probably a good idea to set manual saves in combat to "unlimited" in the config tool or you're going to wear out your F5 and F9 keys, as well as your LMB, from clicking "load game" so often. Be sure to save often as the game CAN AND WILL crash to desktop if you so much as look at it funny or even if it has been running so long. You may also run into terrible framerate lags, especially in towns, and I don't know of any fix. In fact, even the devs don't know how to fix some of the problems, but they sure try.\n\nSince I'm running out of characters, I'll tl;dr this: Slavtastic OPERATING simulator 10/10","October 24, 2015","true","9.3"," 22 of 25 people (88%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","88","22","25","13","1"

It almost feels like a spirtual successor to the old Jagged Alliance games, which have influenced many games in their time. This game does not fail to impress, and emulate all the key elements of Jagged Alliance which made it such a good series, while bringing new features to the table.\n\nBased in the fictional nation of Algeira, a country just north of Brigade E5's previous warzone, you are a mercenary who has been hired to hunt down a Russian man who screwed over a bank and was never apprehended. He has fled to Algeira to avoid prosecution, and you'll have to hunt him down by any means necessary, and bring him back dead or alive. Of course, you'll start the game with rather ♥♥♥♥♥♥ equipment which means you have to spend some time doing jobs on the side, but that's one of the big advantages of the game in a way, as it is a strategy game, yet you get to carve out your own destiny and plan prior to getting stuck in and finishing the main quest before you've even done the cool parts. If you go try to go ahead with the main plot and speedrun it, you'll most likely get curb-stomped unless you know what you're doing, but you're always free to roam the jungle and cities of Algeira, finding quests and new mercs to hire on your way, up to a 6-man squad.\n\nA big plus in my opinion is the HUGE variety of weapons you can get. Literally tons, from Glock 22's and P220's to Remington 870 Magnums and AKS-74U's, all the way up to FN Minimi's and M14 SOCOM rifles. You'll never go more than an hour without finding at least a few new weapons to play with, and they all come in many flavours of calibre, allowing you to mix and match your ammo with Armour Piercing Rounds, FMJ Rounds, and many more variants. Many weapons can also be custom rigged with scopes and lasers to allow you to get the most out of them in a firefight too. Even better is that the game can be installed with the Blue Sun Mod which adds a massive amount of content & weapons to a game which already has plenty to play with. I will mention how to install this mod at the end!\n\nThe game's key feature is Real-Time Pausing, which allows for a mix between turn-based and real-time gameplay, allowing you to experience the best of both worlds. The game can be paused at any time to allow you to command your merry band of mercenaries, and then unpaused to let them carry out their actions. Alternatively you don't need to pause the game once (The game does it automatically VERY often but it can easily be disabled), and instead command your team on the fly, allowing for fast-paced combat and tactical planning to overcome the enemy.\n\nSound Effects - 7.62 has a lot of good sound effects, mostly for the weapons you can get your hands on. Turn bass up on your computer and expect to hear some ear-shattering explosions and gunshots loud enough to kill a blue whale.\n\nGraphics - The game is a little dated now, and the graphics aren't really up to competition with the likes of XCOM - Enemy Unknown, but it's still a beautiful game. Watching the sun set over Algeira as you mow down squads of bandits with unending bullets is truly a wonderous sight. Some of the textures of the game aren't the greatest, but again, it's not a new game.\n\nAI - The AI is what makes the game so challenging. They're bloody smart, and will routinely change tactics just to get the drop on you. Snipers on your squad can be expected to be flanked while they shoot at other bad guys, and you'll have grenades thrown at you purely to force you to retreat, giving the enemy more ground to corner you into. They'll even retreat themselves if they know they're in trouble, and will regroup with their buddies so they can have another pop at you. If it seems too difficult however, you do have an option to dumb down the AI so they aren't performing counter-attacks that would see Delta Force hang their heads in shame.\n\nPlayability - The game is very playable and enjoyable, albeit being a bit confusing at first. Tossed into some Latin country with nothing but a TT-33 and ammo can obviously be a little uninformative, so you'll have to do most of the snooping around yourself. The controls are relatively simple, but do get a little getting used to. One of the good (or bad, depending how you know guns) things about the game is that guns must be cleaned, have their magazines filled individually, and then loaded into the firearm that uses them, as it obviously doesn't help trying to fire empty mags at someone trying to take your head off. So bear in mind to use a firearm effectively -\n\n1. Make sure you have the right mags for the gun.\n2. Make sure you have the right calibre of ammunition for the gun.\n3. Make sure you have the gun loaded with a mag of ammo.\n\nIt may seem a little condescending, but it's painfully easy to run into battle and forget that you never loaded your mags up, leaving you one full magazine to fight many enemies, unless you want to waste ages loading up each mag as you get shot at.\n\n~The game also gives you a lot of leeway too, you aren't in a rush to complete the main quest, and you never really have to. If you just want to shoot cops in a 3rd World Dictatorship then the game won't stop you. But the Army might. On the other hand, if you want to hire your own private army and run a revolution of your own, then you can quite easily do that.\n~The developers of the game are very supportive and helpful to their community, who you can find on the discussions of this game frequently assisting players with technical issues and other options. They are very polite and can definitely be relied on, which is always a good thing.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe bad things worth mentioning\n\n~ The game does have a tendency to crash. Make sure you save often and keep more than one save. The game auto-saves quite often, but even losing one save can set you back a little.\n~Sometimes enemies will get stuck on ladders for whatever reason, so if you've killed all the enemies you see but are still technically in 'combat mode', check the ladders.\n~Whether this is good or bad depends on how you like your game, (I like this but not everyone might) but the game is ridiculously difficult. You can add as many modifiers to make the game as easy as possible as you wish, but even then, enemies are very accurate and can shoot you in the head, (Near blinding you) shooting you in the chest (Crippling you), leg shots and even arm shots which will send your current weapon flying on the floor, stunning you in the process. Sometimes you'll end up in shock if you encounter many enemies at once, get shot at, or whatever else. It can be frustrating, but the enemy is also prone to all of this, so make your shots count. (The game is rather punishing but very satisfying to play)\n~The game is rather cheesy and I wouldn't blame you for forgetting you aren't fighting in the Congo in the 80's, especially with some of the silly dialogue options. The only thing that convinced me otherwise was the fact you can find things like Kriss Super V's and XM8's if you're lucky.\n~Like most RPG's, you can screw some missions up, and not even realise until you get to them. What I mean is that last guy you blasted in that town? Oh yeah, he's part of a quest later. So try not to be too trigger happy, even if it is just so you can kill them and take their weapons.\n\n[All in all however, this game is definitely worth buying. It's a steal too, for only $5, or £4. The Blue Sun Mod is recommended, as it adds a lot to this great game, as well as having patches. You can install it by right clicking on the game, going to propeties, beta (I think it's the last tab) and clicking the community patch.] One of my personal favourites, and I hope it'll be one of yours too. 9/10.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","April 24, 2015","true","135.8"," 18 of 21 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","18","21","0","0"

It's ugly, unforgiving and full bothersome bugs. If you're a person who is raised on perfected, shiny and eye-catching, easy to learn triple A games and you hate games which don't explain anything... Well, this is not game for you. Even if you're a mega-fan of Sir-Tech genius and you love tactical gameplay, it cannot be quaranteed that like you'll like "7,62". Try it yourself, it's cheap and this the only way to judge it.\n\nLonger description (something like review:-))::\n\nThis is a game that is hard to learn and hard to master. Even after 72 hrs of gameplay i didn't reveal all of it's secrets and nuances. You must learn how to travel, explore, fight, trade and execute mission targets by your own. It's highly recommended to read some guide before you enter the world of Algeira. It's not as bad as it can look, trust me. Your real enemy are serious technical issues which you'll certainly encouter during the game: translation problems, bugged quests, freezes and crashes. In addition this is game isn't a pretty one.\n\nSo why there are currently 50 positive reviews on Steam? Because this game do it's job and it's really brilliant in surprisingly many aspects. I do not want to write a book about it. It's easier to me to highlight main points:\n\nPros:\n\n- Graphics: Yep, Industrial Light and Magic didn't make FX for it, that's for sure:-) But you know, this game is not an high budget FPS, but modest tactical one and it's 8 years old! Graphics are pretty clear, you can easily see what is in your inventory, on the ground and where are the enemies. Farther, the are no limitations in camera control. You can zoom in, or zoom out without any restrictions.\n\n- Sounds and music: these are pretty decent. You'll probably get tired of this songs after a couple of dozens hours of gameplay, but you can easy change it using music mod. In terms of gunshot and explosions: you'll probably won't hear it in a loud and "crunchy" way due to distances in gunfight. These sounds are rather sharp, rattling and kind of "dry". There are no "juicy booms", forget about it. I read somewhere that part of these sound were recorded at the shooting range.\n\n- Tactical depth: this is one of most complexed and complicated game in whole military / tactical smart puase / turned based genres. There are virtually no limitations in the way you want to fight with enemy. You can use melee, huge range of small arms, grenades, booby-traps, you can use buildings, vegetation and terrain as cover and your advantage. You can flank your enemies, defend position, or attack aggressivly. Yo can snipe them slowly (if you can), put some OO buck in them in close range, or pin them down using squad automatic weapons. There are many, many tactical solutions, "7,62" at it's best...\n\n- Variety of weapons: you won't find anything that could be even close to "7.62" in this matter. It's incredible how developers and modders did their job. You know, it's like putting an editor from "Guns & Ammo" to game developing process! Yes, it's unbelievable how they have done it. You got everything in here: pistols, revolvers, shotguns, SMGs, rifles, assault rifles, carbines, PDWs, sniper rifles, antimaterial rifles, SAWs and grenade launchers. Every each gun has it's own statistics like: accuracy, durabilty / dirt resistance, rate of fire, inflicted damage / bullet penetration, balance, time to preparation etc. Believe me, this is very sophisticated system which is affected by skills of your merc, use of specific type of ammunition and for example attachments that you can mount on your weapon (scopes, collimators, underbarrell shotguns, bipods, silencers...). If you like guns, you'll be in heaven when you'll see it!\n\n- Smart Pause Mode: There are no action points when you move, shoot, or reload your weapon for example. Character skills are converted into time units. The higher are the merc skills, the faster he or she perform action. Of course there are skills that translate into precision or accuracy. It's very sufficient and effective hybrid system and it simply works very well.\n\n- User interface: Very transparent and intuitive in most cases.\n\n- Enviroment that could be partially destroyed. You can destroy unfortunately only light sources, cars and fences. Well, it's better than nothing...\n\nCons:\n\n- Graphics: Oh man, just look at it...\n\n- First general reception and impression: It's clunky, ugly rough and plain.\n\n- Uncertainty: You never know if you're doing something right.\n\n- Goofy camera control: when you (or your enemies) are in bushes, or in tight building cornes camera starts to act crazy. It's really horrible...\n\n- Bugs, bugs, bugs: you'll find them everywhere. Fortunately, modding community has improved it significantly.\n\n- Pathfinding: it's very annoning, especially in combat.\n\n- Clipping objects and characters: enemies can sometims stuck inside of an inaccessible house and shot you through walls.\n\n- Serious problems with stablility: this game always crashes after one hour or so. There are extreme fps drop.\n\n- Dead world: shabby houses interiors, NPCs are like lifeless puppets, deserted streets and very limited interaction with the environment.\n\n\nAs you see defect list is overwhelming. But believe me, if you're a fan of JA / UFO series, you played Silent Storm and you loved it, and gun-porn is a thing that makes your heart beat faster:-),  well you should at least give "7,62" a chance and consider buying it. This game is unique and you won't find this kind of tactical depth and weapon freakness anywhere else. It's really beautiful Slavic brothel !:-)","January 1, 2015","true","72.4"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","93","13","14","2","0"

This game fails on the basics of a good game though.\n\n\nFew good points:\nThe amount of guns, the different brands of ammo (Brown Bear or WPA), inventory system is what should be in every game. This game also adds the mechanic of having magazines for guns. So you don't reload the gun (unless its an internal magazine) you reload the magainzes and load those into the gun, this allows for a lot more realism that is missing from other shooting games, IMO this should be standard in games.\n\nThe Merc system is nice, but it should of been taken one step farther and allowed you customize mercs. Slave Mercs should level like everyone else.\n\nThe pause system is interesting and different. As a 'gun guy' I feel like some of the timings needed to be adjusted, along with allowing you to do multiple things at once, you can't turn and prone at the same time for instance. It also allows for some time crunching manuveurs. Do you pull your side arm or reload your primary?\n\nThis game is riddled with issues all over and it really ruins the experience in the end. BUT (and the reason I recommend this game) is hopefully more developers see the depth put into the concept of this game and can execute it better.\nSo much potential is lost with this game.","November 13, 2014","true","99.9"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","0"

I love turn/semi-turn based tactical shooters/RPG's.  (and have been playing them since ones like Xcom and MOM, or even the 'Gold Box' series for the C-64 were originally released).\n\nIt's a great concept/start.  And while the same ~9 male or female faces, and running around to various cities asking tons of people the same questions does get tiring - I am more than willing to forgive those little things.\n\nYou REALLY need to add the community mods (Blue Sun Mods, SilverGirls mods - Thanks SG & Thrillseeker)- which add a LOT.  But, imho, they can't overcome the insane inconsistent game mechanics.\n\nThe cameara will drive you insane.  Regardless of the events settings.  No matter how you set the camera settings - you will be moving the camera around manually a LOT (especially elevation).  And you will find that the game will not always move the camera to the appropriate character - even if you have that enabled.  I can't count how many times I've lost someone because they were waiting for someone to enter their view (it's even happened to two characters with one standing behind one kneeling), but were shot by someone in plain sight (and we're talking 5 feet in front of them) because the camera never moved to them or the game selected them.  (and yes - those were set in the settings.)  And trying to view/move into buildings is insane.  You have to get them into a doorway (and if they pause - you're dead) or zoom down incredibly close which then looses area 'context'.  (If you can even do, because the camera won't 'back up' past the edge of the battle field...)\n\nThen there's the 'action'.  Or attempting to figure out how to consistenly 'pause' the action when required.  You invariably screw yourself because you go to pause, only to unpause it becuase the game just paused it before you tried to pause it.  (Get it?)  And, you tried to pause it because one of your characters was in 'no action' mode so that you could have another character do something else first, but the moment was lost because the game autmatically started the action again once you assigned a task to the first character. (And, seriously, every little millisecond in this games MATTERS) There should at least be an option to let you either UNPAUSE automatically - or manually.  (Like after you've assigned orders to ALL non-active allies).\n\nAnd then ther's the issue of the computer constantly 'cheating'.  Like ALWAYS being able to position characters PERFECTLY around corners/doorways so that you can't hit them (trying to do the exact same thing) while they smoke your people.  (And there is a 'jump-areound-the-corner', shoot, and move back, but you REALLY need to micromange camera and time for that character, and it usually doesn't work anyway, because when you pop around they get shots off before you do, or because it decides to have your chaaracter face a completely different direction than the previous one, or two, or...  And because your character HAS to turn to face before they START to shoot, well, you're dead.\n\nOther irritating items:\nCharacters will die after being notifed that they were only shocked (no damage), or sustained very little damage (head, with helmets) or otherwise.  Have seen no damage hits to heads (with helmets) kill characters many times.\n\nCharacters could be in the middle of throwing a grenade when a NPC gets near them, tries to pass, etc., and the player character will stop whatever they are doing to move ("pardon me miss, I was just trying to kill the bad guy"...)  AND, sometimes they move back (and you MIGHT be able to stop it).  And sometimes they don't.\n\nYou will select Snap Shot for speed, and it does an Aimed shot anyway.  Or you select Aimed - but then you can't aim. (And I am talking about tens of times from the exact same save point - not different circumstances).\n\nAllies cannot shoot (even when barrel shows it extends past) or throw objects through walls.  Enemies can.  (Even when they are far away from it).\n\nOr, you're in a crouched position, and you can't stand.  (Like, behind a bar counter, which you need to - to be able to shoot the bad guys, but thery're blasting your head away meanwhile...)\n\nForget trying to get past the Top Secret mission.  It will take you hours and hundreds of attempts.  (In a bar with 'innocents, and the enemy can get off 10 shots for each one of yours.  You can even trow grenades from behind the bar (ducked down) without those characters getting picked off - or the grenades going everywhere else, yadda...  (I still haven't - and have tried all kinds of ideas, including shooting/grenading first, trying to lead out of the bar, yadda...)\n\nAnd while you can get it at an excellent price, I believe there are other similar games at the same price point that aren't anywhere near as frustrating.\n\nThis game does have the potential to be an awesome one.  But it needs some serious work.  Save your money.  And your time.  And your sanity.  Especially 'casual' gamers.","November 16, 2014","false","93.1"," 32 of 52 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","32","52","0","2"

You really see that levelling up makes sense\nNegatives:\n- Glitchy.

(its very hard even on normal)\n+Gun physics are great.\n+Looting system is very good too.\n+Wepon modifications.\n+Other physics in the game are great too. (except what buildings can be destroyed)\n+All your crew members are very important for you if they die, thats it, you lost them and there is no way to get them back.\n+Health and injuries system, its very realistic, and you can easily bleed to death or get to bullet in your head or just a scrap from explosion what you or your enemy made and THATS IT you are DEAD!!!\n\n\nCons: -No good toturial.\n-It's way too hard at the beginning of the game.\n-Bandits will keep attacking you and you will have to last stand against them for really long time until you get bigger squad size or better cars.\n-Mercenaries (squad members) are way too expensive.\n-Map isnt very big and only few towns.\n-Few Combat Maps outside the towns, so you will keep fighting in zones again and again, but that isnt the main problem.\n\n(played about 30hours in Hard Life DLC/MOD)\n\n\nMy verdict about this game: 1) Stay away\n2) Only recommended when on sale\n3) Recommended\n4) Highly recommended\n5) This is a must play","May 8","true","2.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dzander/recommended/289890/","dzander","CPTANONYMOUS","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dzander/","327 products in account","762 High Calibre is a top-down RTS game with RPG elements. You play as a mercenary hired to find and assassinate a man hiding somewhere in the war-torn region of Algiera, where a corrupt government faces off against an equally corrupt organization of rebels. Bandits, smugglers, mercenaries, and drug cartels run amok-taking advantage of the civil war to turn a profit at the expense of innocent people. You will have to choose your battles wisely and your friends carefully.\n\nThe gameplay is good, with a focus on a large amount of weapon variation and the ability for players to choose how they want to apporach a given tactical scenario or situation. Either way, the player will almost always be vastly outnumbered by enemies, and combat is brutal (though in a good, challenging way.) and rarely felt frustrating to me personally. The player is given the option of choosing which side to support (The government or the rebels), which of course affects the story.\n\nThe game does have a number of issues-there are some translation problems here and there or stilted dialogue, and the camera is uncooperative, especially when trying to rotate when you are near the edge of a map. There are some very occasional crashes.\n\nAll of these things, however, are certainly worth dealing with, at least for me personally.\n\nThe game comes with the hard life addon, which adds a significant amount of content to the game, though personally, I would recommend the blue sun mod, which also comes standard with every purchase (and can be activated by going to your properties-->betas tab, and clicking "Community_patch_and_bsm" from the dropdown menu. It has much of the content from te hard life addon, plus much more.)\n\nAll in all, I'd say this game was an enjoyable experience for me.","November 20, 2015","true","59.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

In the same vein as that title, it is a real-time with pause tactical shooter much like the newer Jagged Alliance titles such as Jagged Alliance: Back in Action and Jagged Alliance: Crossfire. I haven't played as much of this one because it seems like it's actually more buggy than the earlier one; it runs fine on my gaming PC but on my laptop, if I change a single setting and restart as the game prompts me to, the resolution bugs out in the menu, leaving the game unplayable without a full uninstall. Beyond that bug, it seems a little less deep than Brigade E5 in terms of gameplay, but that might just be my initial impressions in about half an hour of gameplay.

Because it fails. It's not all bad but definitely a bad game:\n\nPROS\n* Character equipment customization\n* Wandering around the streets gathering intel on objectives, playing in a undercover operative kind of way\n* Active pause to give orders and evaluate situations before moving\n\nCONS\n* Terribly confusing. Knowing what to do, where to go or even what your objective is or why you're even here is a challenge in itself\n* Terrible AI that makes the enemies either dumb as hell or incredibly overpowered\n* Luck based combat: Sometimes a character can tank a few bullet like it's nothing more than mosquito bites, sometimes a single bullet will knock them down and they will take forever to get back up, while still being shot at (so it pretty much means death). This applies for the payer or the enemies.\n* Automatic actions are terrible: the game autopauses when you're spotted by an enemy but you want to pause because pause too because you saw the enemy coming? Odds are you're just going to unpause the autopause that paused teh game a few miliseconds before you pressed the button. Happens ALL THE TIME. Too bad, considering combats are so clunky that even easy encounters can go to hell very fast.\n* The interface is unclear\n* It takes forever to move around or to do something, even organizing the inventory is tedious\n\nTL;DR: This can could be good if it wasn't for it's slowness, the confusing interface, story, missions and terrible attempts at automatising things.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lonesoldier62/recommended/289890/","lonesoldier62","Skeleton Man","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lonesoldier62/","89 products in account","Pros:\nVery large diversity of weapons\n\nLots of things to do (huge amount of missions and a large area to roam around in)\n\nHeavy micromanagement is possible in your squad (dictate how much ammo they carry, where they carry it, how they carry it, and a bunch of other stuff)\n\nMines to Sniper Rifles to Light Machineguns to Pistols to Submachine guns\n\nAmmunition system and inventory mangement is very robust, allowing things such as custom magazine loads (one armor piercing round to two hollow points, repeated until the mag is fiiled, for example) and makes the distinction between ammunition and magazines important. Guns also can overheat and jam depending on condition and rate of fire, which is a good mechanic to keep in mind. (However some weapons like the UMP-45 overheat after just one magazine, which is fairly dumb))\n\nCons:\n♥♥♥♥ voice acting (you're not going to want to listen to any of the first three squadmates saying anything, ever)\n\nTerrible story and writing (merc goes to ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ country to find some random guy we know nothing about and kill him for someone else, ends up killing half the population of africa on his quest and commanding a small military encampment, all the while babysitting a drunken spanish guy who has connections to his brother, who is an idiot, in the police department of a town allowing you to become a beatcop which has nothing to do with the main story. Essentially, you take a roadtrip to africa and kill anyone who happens to be in the way, which is everyone.)\n\nExtremely Random Number Generation (RNG)-focused mechanics (90% of the game is hoping the enemy doesn't get a lucky shot on you or one of your mercs, literally forcing you to savescum through the entire length of the game. At some point in the game you will get shot and knocked unconscious by a random bullet that flew through the wall of the building you happened to be in while you're in combat. In addition to this, grenade damage is largely based on random numbers as well. I once landed a ground-impact grenade almost directly on an enemy's foot and he only took 2-5 damage from it and was slightly staggered. Meanwhile he grazed one of my mercs with a hipfire SMG shot which made him drop his weapon and go into shock for three seconds, thus allowing the enemy plenty of time to take a proper aimed shot at his still target and kill him)\n\nTerrible AI (AI is somewhat decent in open areas, though you'll be dealing with a whole lot of bullets randomly hitting you from impossible distances. In close quarters the AI is absolutely horrid and usually opts to phase through walls instead of using the doors, making shooting at them a guessing game. Thankfully this is somewhat remidied by the ability to blast people apart through walls if you use freeaim, but it doesn't help much. There's also a "dumb AI" difficulty option, so one can only imagine how the AI could get worse than what it already is. Opening doors is also instant (even though the game pauses the combat for you when you would see the enemy opening the door), it's still a ♥♥♥♥ mechanic. During a fight between an ally city and a rebel faction, even so much as grazing one ally cop with one damage from a grenade would turn the entire faction against you, and you'd promptly be stomped by both sides.)\n\nTerrible spawn placements (Upon arriving to a hostile town cops will quite literally spawn behind you and infront of you, giving you approximately nil time to actually shoot them if they're more than five meters away. This will lead to much savescumming as you hand pick the best scenario in which you sucessfully spray down the nearest enemy and dodge the bullets of everything else)\n\nGarbage scale outside the map (Maps are apparently very limited in size, this is shown very well when your squad member with 70 sniping armed with a Scoped Mosin Nagant has only a 30% or less chance to hit someone at 100 meters. 100 Meters is a trivial distance for almost all rifles and carbines, and even SMGs in real life. The maximum distance you might ever engage someone at in this game is about 200 meters, but have fun firing off 99 rounds before you get one grazing hit on their arm.)\n\nVery bad quest mechanics (Most quests have to be done very specifically or only allow one option to completing the quest, or else it will usually end up incomplete forever, or best case scenario until the quest's time runs out. For example, I had already killed Mister Sister, the Hooker in Puerto Vejo, before taking the job from the priest in Santa Maria to kill him (or her, who really cares). After I took the job from the priest, I was unable to turn the quest in as completed nor find the aforementioned dead character again to kill again. Thus, the quest timed out and failed. Or another quest, where you have to plant drugs on a drug distributor. You have the option to plant him, kill him, or make him bribe you 10,000 eldos to make you leave him alone. I took the bribe and then killed the gang members before they could run and despawn, however I had to call the quest in as a bribery result and got a new quest telling me I had to kill him again. As with the previous quest, I couldn't kill someone that's already dead and was now stuck on that particular line of quests forever. Pretty much, you can only do quests in very particular ways, and if you try to do it your own way the game punishes you by breaking and not being fixed until you revert your save (which it may have already overwritten your autosave, so good luck with that))\n\nTerrible AI - Part 2 (I was able to walk up to four seperate cops in Puerto Vejo and blast them in the face with a shotgun point blank with only so much as a stren WATCH YOUR FIRE from any nearby cops. after killing half the town's locals and trying to set mines down infront of cops, they finally had enough of my ♥♥♥♥ and I save scummed until I funneled them all into the bar and blew them up with TNT charges and shotgun fire. Using the blue sun mod I was able to "take control" of the area, and now any time I come back to that zone 10 cops will instantly spawn and give me a fight.)\n\nAmbush system (Absolute trash, usually what ends up happening is you get stuck in the middle of an open area and you have to fight your way to an exit point. This would be easy if you could of course hit anything beyond those objects at 1-10 meters, and it would also be easier if the enemy wasn't on the defensive side. Instead of "robbing" you like the game implies, the enemies just camp the exit points until they see you or you take a shot at them. After that every other enemy in the sector will converge on you while the ones defending the exit you're trying to get out of will promptly shoot you until you die. And if they don't kill you, you'll get shot in the back by floating question marks that indicate "there's noise behind you".)\n\n2/10, it's fun for a time but the AI and base gameplay is too horrid to actually play it for an extended period of time. It might be salvagable if it had some sort of survival zombie mod for it, as this inventory and loot system could work perfectly with it, but frankly there are just about no decent mods that fix the base game. Even blue sun's overhaul mod is shoddy at best and adds a bunch of "different" weapons that are mostly just the previous weapon with a slightly longer barrel or otherwise.\nGet it if it goes on sale for a dollar, otherwise don't even bother. One of the few fun things is to get a high capacity weapon and spray with it.","February 23, 2015","false","54.2"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","1"
