THIS GAME IS TERRIBLE. THEY ARE NOT TO BE TRUSTED.\n\nI was rooting for Vinci Games, I really was. I wanted to like this game so bad. My brain was screaming don't buy this game, but I decided to follow my heart and give it a try. I regret my decision so much.\n\nHere are my reasons:\n\n\nI dropped my gun and couldn't pick up another one, the optimization was iffy, I got stuck on a pipe, the game design seem to be limited to grab the keycard and hit the thing, and in the short time I played I managed to turn the entire game wire frame by hitting esc and when I pressed F2 the entire thing quit itself. It took me all of 12 minutes to want my money back, as this game does not offer a compelling story or fun game experience. It was ear destroying ambient noise, unappealing AI interaction and absolutely no depth in combat, with a complete lack of any other mechanic. Unlike the description, there where almost no dynamics, and I was not even slightly thrilled playing any part of this game. This game is so bland, it makes air control look fun. You just run around and hit the same 4 or 5 monsters the entire game, with absolutely nothing satisfying about getting a kill. Sometimes there is one on the floor, which does the same thing, and sometimes there is a big one, which does the same thing. You just pathetically wallop them with your flashlight until they crumple up and instantly disappear. If you want a good sci-fi horror shooter experience, you are probably just better off installing Doom 3 again, because this game seems to be a horrible mangle of concepts from different titles that got tossed into one giant unappealing mess of a game. This is possibly one of the worst games I have ever played in my life. Even worse than early access, because they are trying to market this featureless pile of dung as a pulse pounding horror game.","December 8, 2014","false","0.2"," 402 of 478 people (84%) found this review helpful 31 people found this review funny","84","402","478","31","22"

It's repetitive, boring, and lack of content makes it a shallow game which needs much more time in the development cycle. You'll find bugs a plenty and combat is slow, mundane, and uninteresting.\n\nWhile the enviorments themselves are interesting at first, they lose their appeal after the first level. Mostly because it's copy pasted over and over and over again through out the 7 levels seperated by 3 stages in each one.   The game can be beat within a range of 2 hours if you put a lot of effort to it, or even 30 minutes if you spend time using the console which is still enabled.\n\nOverall, this game needs work.

I wanted to love Cargo 3, it had a price tag that agreed with me 4.99, was a FPS sci fi horror game and generally looks like something I would love.  After downloading the game I was stoked to play it.\n\nAfter the first minute of playing I had already come to regret my decision.  The movements are sluggish and kind of unresponsive.  You randomly take damage for no known reason, looking in all directions I saw nothing that should have damaged me but none the less I was damaged anyway.\n\nThe hit detection also seemed to suffer from the same unresponsiveness that the controls did.  Pressing the fire button would cause my weapons to fire 3 to 5 seconds after I pressed the actual button.  Which allowed the creatures to start attacking me.  Point blank shots seemed to have no effect on these creatures at all..\n\nEventually I found my way to the first level's end... I think?  I was greeted with a loading screen... upon reloading, I was devoid of my weapons.  After wandering for a few moments I was attacked and killed as I had no weapons to defend myself  (this was a bug, when I reloaded the checkpoint my gun was back)   After wandering a little while longer I was killed while my point blank bullets cruised through the creature right in front of me.\n\nI think this game could be good, if the movements and hit detection were fixed, while it certainly won't win any game of the year awards for the low price of 4.99 with some fixes it could be worth a few hours of game time.","April 24, 2015","false","0.2"," 80 of 92 people (87%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","87","80","92","3","3"

There is simply no better way to put it. Its graphics, its design, its sound effects, everything.\n\nTruth be told I like indie games and I like giving them a chance. This is how it all began with Vinci Games. The horror genre is one of my favourites, anyway. Not to mention when the atmosphere is greatly determined by the presence of zombies or zombie-like creatures. And of course, the sci-fi environment gave another reason to give this one a try.\n\nOne thing you notice right away is how the game allows you to continue your progress. Even before starting a new game. No, there's no data and you will start a new game but what kind of programming and preparation happened in the background if the main menu has such a mistake?\n\nThen you start in one room and go to another one. And then another one. And these look very similar. And once you come across with a new design later on you'll encounter the same elsewhere. The game barely offers any variations. There are some pictures and text telling you the story before the menu but once you are in the game there's no indication as to what you need to do. Yes, later on you encounter a door that requires a red card but... that's it? And the next level says green card. Really?\n\nWell, yes. It reminds you of Doom. But Doom was released 20 years ago. Enemies appear out of nowhere and once killed they respawn later on. Several times they respawned right in front of me or in the next room (as the smoke effect was visible through the wall). You kill them with a drill you are provided with at the beginning then you continue looking for the key and do the killing to the same creatures you have already disposed of. Oh, and some of them hide behind the wall which opens up after a while (again, Doom by id software).\n\nI do not know what happens later on as for me it was perfectly enough to get to the 2nd level and quit in order to abandon this mess once and for all. And this game costs 10 euros? It is a joke.\n\nI think Vinci's credo is as follows: "Let's make a game with the critically acclaimed Unreal engine and cash in on the well-made trailers."\n\nThis is bad. Very bad. Avoid it as far away as possible. Other, relatively cheap / low budget games from the same genre but with excellent design / atmosphere / idea: Outlast, Forest, Slender The Arrival.","March 4, 2015","false","0.5"," 82 of 112 people (73%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","73","82","112","18","5"

Seems like it takes 8 seconds to switch from holding the flashlight over to the odd spear launcher thing since you're not allowed to both see and aim at the same time in a nearly all dark environment. Some enemies seemed unable to pass through an open door while others have textures that pop out on the other side of a closed door. This really should have been a free demo.\n\nSave your money - it's not even worth the $5.00 I spent on it.

Literally all you do is run around some facility (god knows why) collecting keycards and then going to the next area, with a few new enemies here and there.\n- When you advance to a new area you have to push one of the weapon keybindings to even gain access to your weapons again (not that big of a deal I guess, but the first time I advanced it took me ~10 minutes to figure that out without wandering helplessly trying to avoid monsters).\n- The weapons are also horrid. I got to the 5th level before I even found a proper weapon that wasn't a drill.\n\nJust don't buy in to this game. You'll regret it. I feel cheated even for the miniscule price I paid for it.

Not enough weapons so you end up fighting superior monsters with just a flashlight.  Poor game planning.  AI enemies will follow you around no matter how fast and far you run and hide they always run straight to you.  Spent the first five minutes trying to find a red key card using only my flashlight against 20 enemies, there was a gun but it ran out of ammo quickly with no ammo in sight and died.  Flashlight moves around so much it made me dizzy and vision is constantly blurred by overuse of weird membrane type bubble around you.  Having a flashlight and clear FOV is hard enough for a dungeon scenario but add all the extra crap on top and it's unenjoyable.   Game has promise but it's not fun and almost painful to try and play in those conditions.

The graphics are enjoyable thats probably the only positive i can give. The modles of the zombies arent the greatest but they move and attack quite nicely, the guns look decent but graphics wise everything gets held back because of the poor visuals, and by that i mean 90% of the maps are very dark and you must use the 3 available visions that are given too you, personally i used Nightvision. The whole time there a grey lines shooting across your screen almost as if you are in a flashback of some sort, it doesnt help with the game play but you get used to it after a while.\n\nall in all id give graphics a 6/10\n\nThe graphics sadly were not the only thing with flaws, for mutants id never expect them to sound the way they did.\neach mutant has their own sound and honestly none of them have good sound effects, the first mutant you encounter sounds like a high pitched crow and it just doesnt make sense when you hear it.\nThere is only one song/sound that plays in the background of the game and it doesnt add to the suspense at all, the sound of the foot steps you take is one of the better sound effects in the game.\nAlso the sound effects of your character choking to death on the gas in the poisonous rooms, its quite realistic and makes you feel sick to your stomach.\n\nI could probably forgive all of the above issues if the game was not so repetitive and bland.\nI will give a breif run through on how this game is, the only story concept of this game is at the start when you read about what happened and why your character is in this hell. All you are told to do and all there is to do in this game is to collect cards to open special doors that will bring you to the next level.\nThe cards are not very noticable and for the first five or six cards you find they are in the exact same place (where you replenish your HP, Armor and Energy), then the odd time you will find it in a corner of a random room.\n\n\nThe plot and story is short and has really nothing to it, no thought or effort.\nOther problems i found with this game is the mutants spawn where ever and when ever they please, if you dont kill them they just stockpile and there becomes an abundance of mutants everywhere. You get nothing for killing these mutants and the wepons given to you, especially at the start of the game are not anywhere near helpful.\nBoth guns i collected took far too long to kill the mutants and even longer to reload, and the melee weapons you are given take about six hits to kill a mutant and as you progress the zombies get stronger so of course it requires more attempts to kill a muntant with whatever weapon your using.\nIf you dont kill the mutants of course they follow you until you are far enough away, but it is very easy to be trapped by them inbetween doors or in corners. If you dont have your weapon at the ready or have an opening to get away you will die in seconds.\nAlso at the start as i was progressing through the game, i noticed as i passed through the doors that required keys to get through the maps were being recycled. I noticed and recognised a lot of the same rooms and hall ways, as crazy as that sounds but when the whole concept of a game is basically a search and destroy, you tend to give yourself side objectives (because you get none in the game).\nAlso this game is not scary at all, nothing about this game makes you feel terrified or worried. Zero sense of ergency.\n\nIf you are like my self and like to state your oppinion for others to interpret, but can still enjoy a game as is, then for the right price this game is for you.\nThis game does feel a little unfinished and quite rushed, but this wont be the last time i will play this game.\nI do like to finish what i started and i intend on finishing this game.\n\nIn total i give this game about a 4/10","April 28, 2015","false","1.0"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

It goes for the classic grid-like map gameplay. Problem is, IT ALL LOOKS THE SAME.\n- Story: I did not play long enough to see if their is a story to be experienced with the game, mostly because I couldn't play the game to experience it.

I can play games like Dead Space, Bioshock Infinite, Skyrim, and Dishonored without issue, on the highest quality.\n=======\n\n\nCargo 3 prompted me, after hitting "New Game" for the first time, with a "This will overwrite save data" pop-up. It even had an available option to "Continue", had I not chosen "New Game". Usually that option is blacked out unless a save-file is found, but, I digress; that's not really an issue, it's more of a quandery as to why it was not thought of in this case.\n\nAlso, the noises the game makes when highlighting and selecting options? Ghastly stuff, that.\n\nAfter continuing on to start a new game, I was left with a loading screen for what I timed to be about 7 minutes. In those 7 minutes, I tried to figure out what the blazes the background was supposed to be. I also noticed that the spinning skull icon, after a few instances of screen freezing, teasing me that the game may actually have been loaded by this point, the skull icon had shifted to the right, and slightly up, leaving behind it's red-glowing outline. This shouldn't be normal.\n\nOnce the game finally loaded, I was confused to find that every minute movement I made froze the game momentarily, before allowing me to try moving again. Standing still, the game seemed laggy; moving around was impossible. I turned all the graphics down to the lowest settings, and found it much less detailed and pretty, but much more vexing. Now I could move, but the game looked terrible, and was still lagging out.\n\nI managed to switch from the flashlight to the gun-like-type-thing, and waste "Energy" by using the LMB. Using RMB shot something out that looked horrendous, and prompted a sluggish reload, so I quit and turned the game off.\n\nUtterly disappointing.\nI might have to try a re-install and see if that fixes the issue...\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...Uninstalled~","June 26, 2015","false","0.2"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

Again and again restarting did nothing.\n\nI then restarted the level, which actually took me back to the start of the game. This time I played two levels, where it saved as I started the third. I died badly because I could not find ammo before I got marauded. I quit kind of fed up.\n\nI just came back to continue game from checkpoint at start of first level.

Before all the hate I am a customer. I only say this because I have read some comments where people claim their is a conspiracy going on that the developers are making alternative steam accounts to positively rate this game. I highly doubt that and most of the negative reviews are from people that have not spent a couple hours in this game nor tested the game out in early- mid January when most of the patches fixed previous issues with performance.  However, I felt I needed to do a review now instead of waiting later down the road if I do get fairly far. First of all alot of the negative reviews are from before the game was updated in regards to framerate issues, difficulty and minor bugs at doors that were occuring.\n\nAll of this got fixed through the January updates the development team made where they  balanced the difficulty out more and added some more modes such as a night vision mode etc...    and fixed all the major bugs and preformance issues that did previously occur according to various people though I never had many problems to begin with. You have to remember that this is a first attempt at releasing something on Steam for this development team. They are not an american studio and they lack the experience with all of Steam's functionality currently. That is why step by step they are learning more about Steam's platform to see just the potential they can have as a company on the PC.  Many people say that this company has been lying to their consumers. Even if you are right, many companies due this upon release with the exception of Nintendo never doing it to customers. You do not always get what you pay for with brand new modern games now nor the potential and expectations you have for a game right when it comes out usually these days. Though sometimes you are left leaving satisfied and glad your money near releases were well spent.\n\nStory:\n\nIt lacks a story pretty much which I actually love to say the least. I don't want a huge story in a game like this. I want places to go, new challenges to take on and new areas to unlock while back tracking my steps to find the ultimate goal which is to get key cards to unlock the safe zones in which you move on to other areas.  The main backstory is that you are supposed to find the missing answers to what happened to your crew and why an infestation of zombies took over. Are there any survivors?  As I have said I assume the story continues later on in the game as you progress though I cannot confirm since I only have spent a couple of hours in gametime so far. Even without a short story it is a good pick up and play game when you do not feel like long story games and just want a pick up and go game where action, survival , resource management and strategy are key towards being sucessful and mastering this game.\n\nGameplay:\n\nMost of the time you go around dark corners with a flashlight and zombies will be right around doors , inside certain environments and even in back corners. You can pick up a variety of different weapons with the main standard being a mini-gun that you use to disperse of zombies to make it to new areas. Sometimes you may even be able to totally evade a zombie without it hurting you.  Each weapon requires energy to use.  Once all this energy gets depleted then you are just left wacking zombies with your flashlight unless a recharge station for resources is nearby which they are usually a couple per level. The flashlight is not as powerful as other main ranged weapons but it gets the job done many times in melee combat.\n\nNow that all of that has been said, there are usually a couple of areas per zone and level that is not a dark black color as your standard doors. Recharge stations are a transcendent pale color. The door per level with a keycard  leads into another door that usually has water beyond that and a keycard lying on the ground to pick up. There are one of these per level. Then your mission becomes to backtrack through doors to find a panel where a keycard can be entered to open the safezone to move on to the next level.  When you go through other places in the level you will quickly find a couple areas per level where you can fuel up on health, ammo, energy and armor. You have to make decisions wisely so you don't run out of power to operate all of these things. I call these places recharge stations where you get to recharge all your resources multiple times but when it runs out, it runs out\n\nGraphics:\n\nGraphics are insanely good for this game. It operates on the unreal 4 engine and looks very polished. It has modern day graphics. Graphics probally are not as good as some of the newer AAA games out there but for an indie game is fully top-notch.  It is hard to compare the graphics with another game to see how it truley compares without experiencing it for yourself.\n\nLasting appeal:\n\nFor those days you do not feel like powering through a story , only have a couple hours or have had just a tiring day at work this game is for  you. It is an FPS centered game where you can just shoot zombies blocking your main goal being to collect key cards to unlock new areas, levels , zones and chapters. From what I have played so far it does not have a story except for a backstory at the start of the game. Maybe it progresses later on, though I am not sure. Still it is an fps without much distraction from a story which makes it a good pick up and play option where you can try to get to the next safezone to save before logging out. It autosaves when the one safezone per level is found.  That is usually the place primarily only where this game autosaves as far as I am aware.\n\nModes:\n\nAfter many patches the developer of the game has added four new modes.  These modes only enchance different visual options . The ones available right now are Nightvision, Shadow & Frenzy mode. I have not tried these modes out yet so I do not know how cool it is yet.\n\nOverall the developer says it is like Doom, though it does not even look anything near Dead Space except for maybe the doors you walk through. I never have played Doom so I cannot make an accurate comparison nor confirm the similarities nor dissimilarities.  Best of all it is an indie game that is a PC exclusive.\n\nHUD:\n\nFrom what I can remember there is not a mini-map nor large map at all in this game so you have to backtrack which reminds me of Resident Evil I where you have to go through doors and retrace your steps to progress in the game. Overall I like this formula then rather guiding  your hand like most modern games do that tell you exactly where to go. This offers great exploration and the satisfication of finding new zones, new recharge stations and thanking the safezones for saving your butt from all the creatures ( Different zombie formations) lurking beyond doors and in environments.\n\nOverall:\nMany people will underestimate this game, many people will not give this game credit for doing something different and doing it very well. The design is meant for you to think and carefully plan out the retracing of your steps to remember which areas you have accessed and then those in which you have not passed through yet. I personally love this games new approach to bring an old-school mechanic in games where you actually have to go through it like a maze searching for treasure which are the key cards to unlock further areas in the game. It is genious and as I know many people will underestimate , overlook and may even undermine the game for what it is. To some this could be a hidden gem they have waited most of their life for. To others, it could be just a nice pick up an play fps to play after tiring long days at work and yet for others it could be an enriching experience with strategy","February 9, 2015","true","1.9"," 44 of 130 people (34%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","34","44","130","6","5"

I search for info about this game and it comes that this is devs first game. So let's see if this "first time" mixed with own personality is a great way to success...\n\nMy first Cargo 3 playthrough was so exited, I have only one weapon flashlight and few more seconds after first serious weapon with drill at the end of it, nice music and sound around my head (headphones) and first monster zombie. Another room and few more zombies. Another room and new monster type like Dead Space. I thought then "This game is so easy".\n\nAfter few dies I change this sentence to "I have to survive" and "I hate this crawling thing!!!" LOL\n\nAfter 8 levels I died so many times so I don't even remember...\n\nBut after all, this game is so much fun. Cargo 3 is challenging player a lot in many, many moments. In my opinion player stats (life and armor), weapons stats and monsters stats turn challenge mode on. There're rooms that reduce life and armor too wtf???\n\nConclusion:\n\nGame has some potential, but creating graphics isn't only condition to develop good game. Devs have their own vision mixed with Dead Space and Doom and it is totally cool for first game. Good Luck with next games!!!\n\nP.S. I had some technical issues with game performance in few game levels (fps drop down)","January 12, 2015","true","1.9"," 35 of 129 people (27%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","27","35","129","4","0"

So go buy it and experience it.\nThe Lord himself came to me at night and touched me inappropriately with the Epiphany. I saw the way so clearly. I saw our destiny. We must buy Cargo 3 and play it till the end of our lives.\nThis is the work of a true genius. A perfect emerald of magnificence. Emancipating light or pure knowledge. You can't comprehend this noble phenomenon, but you can let it in your heart and gates of Paradise will be open wide for you. 420/10\n\n\n\np.s.: if you are a f**king idiot: it's ironic review. It's worst game ever, you shouldn't buy it and if you did (like me) and enjoyed it (like Satan himself) you should feel bad.\nActually you should feel bad even for opening store page for this s**t game.
