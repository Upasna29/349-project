This game may be Early Access, but you're getting a quality game with tons of content for under $10.\n\n‚ñº THE GOOD ‚ñº\n‚óè Singleplayer took me 5-6 hours with the Warlock Class the first time. About 2 hours as the Shaman the next. It takes long enough that you'll feel satisfied but short enough you won't get bored. Also you can play Singleplayer with friends :)\n‚óè The game world is a LOT bigger than you'd think! It's not Skyrim big, but big for an indie game and filled with hidden passages, loot and monsters.\n‚óè Each class has their own unique spells but most of the funnest ones are at max level so it gives you something to work towards (like the "vine-ladder" spell in the trailer). The game also let's you blatantly see what spells you'll unlock when picking a class.\n‚óè Very well balanced! You should reach level 20 (max) by the time you reach the final boss without any grinding outside of killing everything you see once. The game does a good job being tough, but not impossible and has harder modes for those who find it too easy.\n‚óè Treasure and enemies respawn so you don't need to worry if you miss anything, chances are you can find it again.\n‚óè Aside from the passive quests (kill enough enemies in zone-1, collect 3 unique items from zone-1, kill a unique boss / enemy in zone-1) there are player activated repeatable quests. These are great for leveling up as most of them spawn lots of enemies in an area that's just been cleared.\n‚óè TONS of other game modes for Co-op and PVP!\n‚óè In-game Map Editor is very in-depth and allows some super complex builds.\n‚óè Constant game updates. We're talking a couple a week (depending on what's added), not once every 5 months.\n\n‚ñº THE BAD ‚ñº\n‚óè Finding other players online is a bit tough since the player base is so small. This isn't really a problem with the game, just it's popularity. If you're buying Counter Spell specifically for multiplayer, make sure you have some friends to play with you.\n‚óè Online play can be very laggy depending on the host and result in game crashes.\n‚óè The Map Editor doesn't have a tutorial and is very complicated to learn.\n‚óè Ranged enemies are all over the place making the fighter classes very difficult as a starting character.\n‚óè Combat is shooting with spells / arrows or slashing with a sword. If you've played one mage, your basic attacks won't change, only your spells. There isn't any way to "fix" this, I just found the game gets a bit grindy on your second playthrough with a similar class.\n‚óè XP drops from enemies in the form of purple crystals and forces the player to collect them. This isn't so bad at first, but try doing it for the entire game. Quests give XP instantly and even playing online shares XP as soon as an enemy is killed, so I'm not sure why the crystals are there.\n‚óè Enemy AI either "sees you" or "doesn't see you yet". When activated, they'll run towards the player no matter the distance until you or they are dead. NOTE: Minions use the same AI so they will aggro everything they see. I'm not really complaining about this feature because the AI works fine for what the game is, but I didn't consider it a "good" selling feature :P\n\nIf you want to see some gameplay, here's my First Look video where I explain the basic game mechanics and show a few spoilers about the end-game https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5zmVlBg5Ss\n\nThanks for reading!

It's fun. Remember to create a class before you start. As you level up you get skills which unlock on your skill bar.

Counter Spell.\n\nHow I love the.\n\nThis game is insane once you get into it. And no we're not talking rubber room insanity here. This is full on 25+ enemies rushing you and your party that total only 3 or 4 people. Sure you can have more people if they join you or if you drag them into it. But you will know when you find that other person that knows what they're doing with this game. Because then things just explode forward.\n\nSurvival is the best mode in my opinion. Endless waves of enemies that grow in level. Your level caps at 20, but not the enemies. If you can survive. As of right now, me and some other people have hit wave 200. And because I had to go, didn't get a chance to see how much longer we've could've gotten. The enemies were level 50 or 45 I believe, while again we stayed at level 20.\n\nAs for the other modes. I've not tried them much. But it mostly depends on what you like and who you play with. You can build maps then upload it to the workshop. Which the building system is a little tricky, but you can do quite a bit with it. Plus it's fun to make a map then survive on it.\n\nLet's talk about the dev a moment. The dev is great with updates and he/she listens to suggestions and updates roll out regularly. Which is a huge plus for this game, and I love how this game is shaping up to be.\n\n15/10 Gameplay\n15/10 For the dev being active.\n10/10 for the graphics\n20/10 for the price\n\n999999999999999999999999999999999999% Fun.","October 15, 2015","true","132.4"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

While I did enjoy playing Counterspell for a little bit, it still needs a lot of work to make the game a lot more fun and a lot less frustrating.\n\nFor starters, spawn poins can be pretty unpredictable. I started the game at level 1, only to die in a level 16 zone. Unable to kill anything or find out where to go, I had to die at least 6 times until I spawned in a level 2-3 zone. Enemies can be overwhelming. At times, it seems like they have the eyes of a hawk and attempt to snipe you from a large distance, and if this happens, you can bet there's at least 6 other NPCs following you.\n\nThe Questing system is unfavorable. I would start a quest, fail because I died, only to complete another quest that I never started, which was pretty confusing.\n\nOn the brighter side, I love the spells, armor, and items. It feels a bit like a retro version of World of Warcraft, which I'm a big fan of.\n\nHas the potential to be a very fun game, but still currently could use a good amount of polishing to avoid headaches and frustration.","October 8, 2015","false","0.4"," 11 of 20 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","11","20","0","0"

Especially for the price.\nCant wait to see how it pans out.\n\nPicked rogue, 360 wall jump headshot a goblin 10/10\n\nEDIT:\n~\nI've now played mostly through the campaign co-op with one of my friends and it was loads of fun.\nEarly access is a scary thing to get into these days, but the dev(s) have been updating it regularly as long as I've owned it. Classes are being expanded and new features come every once and a while.\n~\n\nEDIT #2 Post release:\nSo I picked the game up after playing a bunch of old games in my library that were in EA. This game has gotten alot better than it was before. You can customize your playstyle pretty well depending on what you like to use. I made a priest to go through the story again and used daggers rather than a staff. Lots of new abilities on some of the more lacking classes of old. New areas that are optional, new game modes that are even fun against bots alone.\n\nThere are a lot of game modes that I havent tried out yet. I tried most of the classes in the campaign for a few quests/levels then went to go try out survival and played that 3 times. There's a lot of replayability in this game from what I can tell. Due to the different game modes that provide pvp/solo/co-op. There's a good handful of maps that all connect together from the campaign that you can play all of the game modes on, as well as what seems to be 2 separate maps that don't connect to the rest of the game, but I haven't tried them yet, so that's just speculation. The random dungeon generator is probably whats going to keep me playing this game for a while though. I'd love to see some more classes, or the current classes to be expanded more (There have been new spells/abilities added from patches so far).\n\nThe only real problems with the game that I've seen so far are:\nStealth - There are a lot of lights around the maps that make it hard to really go full stealth through everything. You CAN stealth though, I've assassinated a good bit of things. If there were a way to temporarily knock lights out or just less lights in some areas, stealth would be an option a lot more often.\n\nAI - Pretty basic, just needs some patching up. They mostly just run at you or strafe around trying to shoot you. Spiders are probably my favorite AI because they actually lunge at you and if you dodge it, they'll go flying past you, which is better than just "out run the enemy". I cant complain about it too much though, its EA so it's kind of to be expected.","May 23, 2015","true","39.6"," 12 of 22 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","12","22","0","0"

I found this game surprisingly addicting. Once I became a Rogue and started jumping from rooftop to rooftop I got a strange liking for the game. In total I can see this game being fun to watch update and play.\n\nI really hope to see this game get popular. Sadly there is barely anyone playing it right now... Also, the devs have been updating it nearly every other day, I like this because it shows how dedicated they are to the game. Overall, I love it, it's so simple that it's... perfect? I do recommend this game!\n\nEDIT:\n\nOk, for a while I have not been playing the game but I still have been watching the updates. My response to the updates is, "I love it". Nearly every other day there is an update, if you ever find a bug you can bet on it being solved that week. It is just what a early access game needs. The creators of this are great at making a game for the community.\n\nAlso, after the teaser of Counter Spell Reforged, I am definatley going to be keeping my best eye on this game. I can't wait until it comes out! the one image I have seen so far has made me hyped. It looks a bit more pleasing to the eye and they say it has more combat mechanics.

When you factor in the low asking price, this game's creator is offering you a whole lot compared to some of the indie RPGs being sold for higher prices. You get a bunch of multplayer PVP maps, a single player or coop campaign with a decent sized open world to run around in. The main complaint you will read in reviews is the graphics, which are nothing fancy, but not as bad as some would indicate. This game appears to be the work of a lone developer, one who has been patching the game almost daily and routinely comments in the forums. For the low asking price, I highly recommend Counter Spell.

It‚Äôs not hard to see where Abnormal Studios went wrong, it‚Äôs not as if the market isn‚Äôt oversaturated with voxel-esque games or any manner of D&D style magical RPGs. That much is obvious, but it stuns me that despite having these played out genres at use, the developers consistently miss any redeeming quality that these genres feed right into their hands. What‚Äôs an RPG without any choice? I‚Äôm not exactly sure, but these developers managed to do that.\n\nAn RPG without choices, huh, I wonder where that leaves us. Normally you would figure that you would have choices when you level up, maybe even dialogue, or how about items that have varying benefits? None of that. Your stats are automatically allocated for you when you level up, none of that annoying strategy or anything to bog you down! It surprised me so much that I thought it was an error on my part, that I couldn‚Äôt find the menu or anything like that. Apparently not. The game claims (according to the store page) that it ‚Äúcombines the elements of classic role-playing games with modern stealth-based shooters.‚Äù I can‚Äôt really seem to find either of those. Not to mention that, even with this auto-allocation of points, it doesn‚Äôt matter for a lot of classes because most of them aren‚Äôt even viable. Warrior, rogue, basically any of the melee classes are a death sentence. Enemies seem to aimlock you across the map, and proceed to bombard fire upon you from every conceivable angle. As I mage I was able to mitigate this for the most part, but otherwise it was a living hell.\n\nMaybe any of this would be forgivable if this egregious offense to the D&D style RPG was presented in any kind of reasonable way. There is little to no instruction in manner of performing any task, including quests. The first quest I attempted to perform was ‚ÄúInspect hull‚Äù, which I assumed was to check out the cargo hold of a nearby ship. After clearing the ship, I went down to the hold and nothing. After much wandering, searching the forums, etc, it seemed I had done everything correctly. I then restarted the quest and did the exact same thing, only for it to trigger completion the second time. Quality debugging on their part. Not to mention that the whole time I am performing this, my eyes are assailed with Roblox quality modeling, no doubt modeled with the top tier of Windows 3.1 ASCII art craftsmanship.\n\nAttempting to find fun in this was like trying to find a piece of hay in a needlestack. My next step in the journey to find this was to travel to the multiplayer, where I was only met with one very, very low populated server. There was many game modes, but almost none of them seemed anything other than the generic capture the flag, deathmatch, and so on. But atleast that much I had come to expect already.\n\nUpon entering I was almost immediately leveled up to near the max level by players shared experience, due to the NPCs being much higher level than I had ever previously experienced, and ruining what little remained of a steady character progression. Despite this, I was immediately picked apart from across the map by extremely aggressive NPCs, and have approximately zero enjoyment during the entire ordeal. Heading back to single player, my advantage made the part I was in a breeze, but however it was not even enough to help me from the developer‚Äôs poorly chained together map design. Places designed for level 12s are backed directly up next to ones for level twos, and so on.\n\n\nThe poor design choice astounded me, and I was met with many times where I would be engaging enemies who would one shot me, because they had escaped their level containment area and preceded to assault me in my own low level zone. On no less than two occasions I was spawn camped by an upper level boss, who proceeded to blast me in my own spawnpoint until I was able to escape by sheer luck. At no point in this did I feel it was any more than a slightly reworked version of someone‚Äôs middle school game programming classwork, or that the developers had done any bug testing at all. Avoid this abomination like the second coming of the black plague. If you have the choice of spending seven dollars on a nice, tasty burger, or this game, the burger is an infinitely better choice.\n\nEdit: I was originaly going to add in a segment about how there was no Linux/OSX port, but then I realized it was actually for the best that fewer people were exposed to this game.","October 22, 2015","false","1.9"," 7 of 20 people (35%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","35","7","20","3","1"

Some mechanics have changed, but overall, it's still not very well polished.\n\nThat being said, a lot of my issues with the game stemmed from playing with a friend who, I'll be honest, prevented me from getting to know other mechanics and simply put, prevented me from enjoying the game.\n\nWhat exactly are my gripes, though, currently?\n\nI don't like the way your character moves. There's no intertia, no momentum to the movement. I start running, then run out of stamina and I'm brought to my normal walking speed in a moment. I can air strafe (not necessarily bad, but it doesn't feel right).\n\nThe update, recently, that made minions prioritize healing players over other minions, though good for some classes doesn't work that well for the shaman. The healing totem thing doesn't seem to readily switch from healing players to totems and seems to ignore the other totem things when it shouldn't.\n\nWhy are there flashbangs? That is the most irritating thing to be in quest mode. I was wandering around, and suddenly **WHITE** and almost got killed. Annoying.\n\nA lot of features are not explained, or I don't know where they were explained. For example where is the explanations for anvils and crafting?\n\nWhy is it so difficult to find shops? Why do they cost so much for basic items?\n\nI have no idea if I have bonuses or not for wearing certain types of armor, and have no idea how to make or find better armor.\n\nLike I said, the game's not polished and I can go on, but won't.\n\nThat being said. The games much nicer than I thought it was when I played with a friend. The map was, slightly, bigger than I thought it was. Perhaps bigger still. I put in about another 2 hours into the game, and for 7 dollars for 6 hours of play, isn't bad.\n\n6/10, recommended\n\n-------------\n**edit** I will be following the development of this game. If I feel that the game has been updated to the point of being a decent purchase, then I will change the recommendation.\n\n---[OLD]Review---\nDon't purchase this game unless its under two dollars. You'll get at most 10 hours of gametime (I only got 4). Though if we judge game time and cost, then this game can have a similar price/hour of gametime as a movie.\n\nThe alternate gamemodes need work, the UI needs work, there need to be more sounds, more interactable characters. The map is small, and the gameplay is simple. I quite like the shaman class, but as far as I can tell, all of the classes lack much depth.\n\nI don't care about the graphics, in fact I think they are charming.\n\nAlso, how the hell are you supposed to open the freaking gate on the castle. My friend and I just leveled his priest up to 20, so he could portal us in. No idea how to do so otherwise.","December 24, 2015","true","5.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's Counter Spell!\n\nValue: 10/10\nCounter Spell gives you a sizeable amount of content for an indie game in its price range, 6 character classes (with more likely coming), and perhaps 10 (and counting) game modes. Plenty of replayability. Plus there's a map builder.\n\nGame design/Balance: 8+/10\nThe 8+/10 means that the game currently gets an 8/10 but I expect it to improve over time. Currently, there are a lot of balance and game design issues, but the developer is almost constantly looking for feedback and advice. It's already better than the vast majority of indie games (and the game design beats most premium/"AAA" games IMO.\nSkills and character abilities are somewhat split between PvE and PvP. (I suggested this because I've seen way too many games get their PvE content ruined with PvP-focused nerfs) There are a wide variety of abilities and items to find and use.\n\nDeveloper attention: 10/10\nAs if Counter Spell wasn't already a bargain, the developer pays a LOT of attention to the discussion forums and feedback. Several of my suggestions have already gone into the game. The devs update the game at least once every 2 days when they aren't on vacation and I'm not seeing any sign that the updates are going to slow down. There are plenty of upcoming features and updates planned.\n\nGraphics: 6/10\nIMO the graphics are good enough. They aren't going to win awards, but most indie games have inferior graphics anyway - an indie game getting a 6/10 in graphics is like a premium game getting an 8.5/10. Besides, if you demand the absolute best graphics, then indie games aren't for you anyway.\n\nAudio: 5/10\nThe in-game music is bland and forgettable. However I would suggest keeping the sound on because it gives plenty of cues about whatever's going on nearby.\n\nTechnical Quality: 10/10\nThis game hardly crashes and when it does, the devs fix it quickly. 3 weeks ago there was a bad patch that was causing crashes and it was fixed the next day.\n\nOther stuff:\n-Counter Spell is quite family-friendly, unlike most similar games. There's NO gore, bad language, or otherwise questionable content. I would recommend an ESRB "Everyone 10+" rating for it.\n-Additional modding support might happen in the future.\n\nSummary:\nThis game is a gem. If you like any of the above-mentioned genres and it isn't in your library, shame on you. It's only 7 dollars... well worth even the full price.","November 11, 2015","true","71.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The concept of the game is brilliant. The graphic design is beautiful yet simplistic. I would recommend this game to anyone who likes rpg/fps. The reason for giving it a 9 is that I believe the building mode could be more efficient and intuitive. For instance, I am not sure what I hit to go into delete mode but there is no way to get out of it. I have to close the game completely. If there is a solution and I have just missed it please inform me :). Also, In warrior class, when you crouch, you can't see anything cause the shield covers your entire view. Other than this, the game is amazing and I love it. For the price, it is well worth it. Also there are so many modes!","October 14, 2015","true","15.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's reminiscent of some favorites already in my collection, with graphics that looked familiar...and has exceeded any games it brought to mind...so I won't say which games they were, to avoid poisoning their reputations by comparison. All I can say is, if you like what you see from the trailers, then you absolutely should buy it! Everything I hoped or expected, and more!

The artwork is still beautiful don't get me wrong, but it also has solid gameplay, lots and lots of content and multiplayer.  $7 is barely enough to buy you a kick in the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• these days, you could do worse than to spend it on a good game from an indie developer.","October 5, 2015","true","12.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Wish i could destroy the blocks tho, but you dont get time to contemplate that during the game because every turn you take leads to another monster that dosent like you.\n\nPlayed an hour so far with my wife and loving it thus far. Judging from the amount of game types i should be set for hours of fun.\n\ngame play - although simple is still challenging (was about to put up the difficulty when a boss comes over and finishes me off in a couple of hits. After a few tries later and a bunch of grenades i showed him whos boss)\nMusic - my type of music, retro ish. almost christmas like...\nChoices - pleanty of characters to choose from and so far only tried warlock and warrior and both very different.\n\nAll in all. from what ive seen in patch notes, reviews and forum is that the developer is awsome and cares about the game. Good job, hope you keep the updates rolling and im 100% glad i got the 4 pack  :)\n","October 6, 2015","true","11.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
