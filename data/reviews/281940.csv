The graphics are gorgeous, imho. They have a beautifully haunting atmosphere and this goes for the music as well. It kept me entertained and that made me happy. What more could I really ask for? The story held my interest long enough to keep playing to the end and unfortunately it's a to be continued story, but I gathered that before I began playing due to browsing the forums. Hopefully, the creators can figure out what to do with it or pass it off to someone who wants to pick up the project and continue it. Despite that I was pretty satisfied with the ending regardless and enjoyed the game beginning to end.\n\nA lot of people complain about bugs and issues with the game, but I never really had any issues with it. Perhaps, I came late into the game when all the bugs had been fixed? It ran pretty smoothly for me and my computer isn't anything high tech to say the least. My only troubles with the game were my own stupidity as I didn't know what I was going to do with a point A to point B situation during jumps and such. Overall the game was fascinating and beautifully constructed, I think people put things down too hard and need to relax and give it a chance. If you played it during all the bugs earlier on during it's release, I'd say give it another go. Those issues might be fixed now.","October 13, 2015","true","29.0"," 175 of 182 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","175","182","0","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lillje/recommended/281940/","lillje","Lilly (✿◠‿◠)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lillje/","2609 products in account","Woolfe attracted me as soon as I saw its store page, even though I am not the biggest fan of platformer games. A story rich game that tells a steampunk version of the Red Riding Hood classical tale, a female protagonist, very nice visuals - all of these contributed to my excitement. However, after I started to play it, my enthusiasm decreased a lot because the overall polish of the game falls short of expectations.\n\nThe story starts by introducing the player to Red's mission: she is supposed to infiltrate the city of Ulrica in order to stop the evil machinations of “B. B. Wolfe” and find her father's assassin. In order to do that, she jumps up on ledges or double jumps to reach far off platforms and fights occasional enemies.\n\nThe game is designed on a 3D plane, and Red has full range of movement but she is largely locked to a 2D perspective. Some of these 3D segments are rather disorientating, since the camera is mostly locked from the front and you can't tell very well which item is closer to the viewer and which is further away, this resulting often in failed jumps, until you learn the exact starting spot of the jump. But even a bigger problem is the controls in this 2.5D plane. Since the controller that I use currently has an issue, I had to switch to keyboard. And moving with a keyboard in a 3D plane, trying to simulate an analog stick using only the arrow keys, is very difficult. This added a lot to the frustration I felt playing this game. I died multiple times during the combat scenes because I wasn't able to move easily in a circle around the boss. This is one of the games that require a controller for a smooth gameplay experience, which a keyboard can't really provide.\n\nThe combat in the game is not satisfying. There are several enemy types in the game (rats, mechanical soldiers, fairies and wolves), but none gives a feedback when hit. There are no health bars on the enemies (unless the enemy is a boss), so you can't tell which one to prioritize from a group. Red has a light and a heavy attack to use, and later in the game she learns a couple of other special moves; these aren't always effective since they're in slow motion, and during those seconds Red is easily stunned making it impossible to attack and consuming her whole attack energy at the same time; hence it's much more effective to mash the buttons for the 2 basic attacks until all the enemies die. Red's weapon accuracy is far from dependable since the enemy hitboxes bug out quite often and there’s no indication of a missed hit whatsoever.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=443555057\n\nOne of the boss fights was really bugged for me, while performing it in hard mode. I spent around 5 hours trying to figure out what I was doing wrong because right before the last phase the boss’ health stopped going down, even though I was continuously hitting him.  Restarting the game the next day fixed the problem - apparently one of the boss’ phases was somehow misplaced and replaced by the easy mode version despite me setting the fight on hard mode from the beginning.\n\nJumping from one place to the next is also a source of frustration in Woolfe, and I've wasted a lot of time trying to progress to the next step because the controls just failed on me. At times, pressing space for double jump midair didn’t seem to have any reaction from the game so I often had to restart from the last checkpoint and do the whole thing again, including killing all the enemies, only to reach the same spot and fail the jump again.\n\nOn a positive side, the game's greatest feature lies in its straightforward, but nonetheless compelling, narrative. The story is narrated by Red through rhymes, and her funny sarcasm accompanies you while platforming through the streets of Ulrica or through the forest outside the city. The music is rather well composed and does add to the atmosphere of Woolfe’s world.\n\nThe graphics are lovely and the lighting effects in the town and forest are impressive. The graphics enhance the story a lot by imbuing everything with a natural magic. However, I can’t help but feel that too much of the budget and time was spent on the visuals alone, leaving the overall experience feeling a bit rushed, but still enjoyable to some extent.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=442399266\n\nOverall I decided to give this game a positive rating since despite the lack of polish in combat and the soggy platforming experience, it manages to maintain a satisfactory level of enjoyment through its unique world, beautifully and artistically designed, as long as you use a controller to play it and don’t go for 100% achievements. Woolfe needed a bit more work before being released and it could have been a great game if the combat bugs were fixed. Nevertheless, it's an impressive effort from the part of a 5 people team.\n\nMore reviews on the Lilly's Corner Curator page","May 16, 2015","true","12.6"," 108 of 125 people (86%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","86","108","125","3","7"

It's got some small issues here and there, but I was willing to overlook them, but I cannot overlook the runtime of the game. (EDIT: The devs have already planned a sequel for august. I still can't recommend this game unless you don't mind paying $10 for a 2 hour game.)(EDIT #2 - 3/28/15: The Devs have patched the game and added many new animations to combat, as well as fixing a lot of bugs.)\n\nI really wish I could recommend this game. I really do. It's a very fun little game, with an interesting use of fairy-tale characters. There are a few bugs left for the team to squash, such as after the final boss, instead of watching the lovely cinematic I got to listen to the VO from the cinematic and walk around in the driveway of Granny's house.\n\nAlso, the game tries to rhyme every other line of dialogue, which annoyed me endlessly by the end of the VERY VERY short experience.\n\nIt's very short. You'll notice that at the time of writing I have about 120 minutes in this game. That's after beating it once through and dying multiple times. (Which is good, this game will make you work a little for your story.)\n\nI wish there were more bosses, because only having two made the pacing feel off. If Wolfe is supposed to be this huge megalomaniac, dictatorial scumbag, why does he only have one henchman? Who lives in the sewer?\n\nThere are about 10 stages, 5 or 6 in the city and the rest are this really cool Trine-esque forest. These stages can be beaten fairly quickly if you don't die/know where to go. There's this stage at wolfe's factory(?) that hints at the game wanting to be slightly more open, or maybe have more complex levels. Really, The game needs more levels so that there are more oppurtunities for Red to talk about why she's looking around, and about her family in general. The beginning makes it out to be this huge undertaking for her, but she ends up completing her mission in a day and a night?\n\nPerhaps this could be fixed by DLC, which I would pay for happily because as is, the story doesn't tie up nicely. There's a short cinematic at the lake that hints at Red's brief relationship with her mother, but doesn't even match up with how Red talks about her mother's disappearance earlier in the game. First she says she disappeared in the woods, and then she's digging tunnels in a mineshaft? Her mother and father had a happy marriage, but he didn't know he had a kid with his wife?\n\nThe combat is fun once you learn a few special moves, and Red's remarks after she learns a new move are nice and characterful. It's almost kind of spectacle fighter-y, although it really lacks any kind of combat system. The game originally tries to set itself up as a stealth-action game but the sneaking is basically abandoned once you get your axe at the end of the tutorial level.\n\nIn short, Woolfe is a fun, gorgeous game that you should look at if you want a quick platformer. If you're looking for a more fully realized experience, you're better looking elsewhere because this game isn't going to last you. If they release DLC or update the game in a meaningful way, I'll look forward to it greatly.\n\nThis studio has some great talent and it will be exciting to see what they make next.","March 17, 2015","false","2.0"," 335 of 465 people (72%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","72","335","465","10","31"

The game for me also has some parallels to American McGee’s Alice due to the two protagonists in the story who are not afraid to get their hands dirty and also share some similar gameplay parallels.\nWoolfe – The Red Hood Diaries allows the gamer to control the protagonist Red who is investigating her father’s death at Mr. Woolfe’s factory and also wants revenge. Red was also raised by her grandmother who taught her a few things about fighting and magic. So with your axe by side, magic in the other, Red commences her journey through this dark and twisted world looking for clues, answers and blood.\nIn terms of gameplay, Woolfe – The Red Hood Diaries is basically a 3D arcade game with a strong emphasis on 2D platforming mechanics which looks glorious on a PC with full detail. The world of Woolfe is rich, diverse and even though it is quite dark can be very colourful at certain times. Apart from killing enemies and fighting bosses, Red must also use stealth to sneak around the environment.\nTo complement the engaging story about Red, there’s some great voice acting that goes hand in hand with the gameplay and the fantasy inspired musical score.\nAlthough the game supports a keyboard/mouse combination, to play the game as it should be played is via a PC controller which transforms the game into a FULL HD arcade console experience. As you defeat enemies, solve puzzles and explore the world, all the clues are right in front of the player but at times, the puzzles which require timing can be quite a challenge.\nAlthough this is only part one of Woolfe – The Red Hood Diaries, developers GriN Multimedia should be commended on creating a rather engaging arcade experience on the PC that harkens back to American McGee’s Alice with its twisted storytelling and gameplay.\nThe game looks beautiful on a PC with some exceptional detail and sturdy gameplay mechanics that for the most part work well. Reiterating again, the game needs to be played with a controller because it does make the experience considerably easier and even though there are a few flaws, it’s definitely a game for those wanting a fun arcade fix.","July 26, 2015","true","24.7"," 54 of 60 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","54","60","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/281940/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","Woolfe: The Red Hood Diaries feels confused. It wants to reimagine the Red Riding Hood fairy tale into a darker, Victorian gothic tale (bearing no small resemblance to the similar idea applied to Alice: Madness Returns) but it doesn’t know how. Ideas bubble around on the surface but always seem to pop before they’ve been explored, and looking deeper only exposes a bigger jumble of incompatible objectives that refuse to settle down as they pull the game in different directions. Pull hard enough, and pretty soon it’s all collapsed at your feet.\n\nTake for instance Woolfe’s world. Grime drips off the walls, buildings cast ominous shadows as they attempt to pierce the skyline; rats bite at your feet as you hide from the giant mechanical toy soldiers patrolling the streets, as the city’s drudge trickles into the river. It’s all wonderfully moody and full of character, something Woolfe lacks in every other area but seemed to at least nail in its setting and tone.\n\nBut then it hesitates and starts questioning itself. Soon the dim streets of the city are replaced with surreal canyons and floating pathways. No justification is given as to why or how the world has suddenly changed so drastically, it’s simply presented to you as if its inclusion in the game is context enough. It was at this point about halfway through the game that everything began to fall apart around me. The world lost its personality and consistency, and without that to hold onto I began to drift in and out of various states of disappointment, no longer able to deny the problems that had been present from the start.\n\nBy forcing me out of the one thing I had started to love, I was left looking at a shell of a game that had taken off its masked and didn’t know where to go from here. The clunky platforming took on new levels of annoyance as I slipped off of ledges or improperly judged a distance as the fixed camera panned away. Combat continued to be dull and flimsy, lacking a sense of impact and killing me at the drop of a hat, as if the numerous bottomless pits and one hit kills throughout the levels weren’t enough.\n\nAnd finally I was confronted with Red herself. At first, like her city, she felt cold and calculating. Her sense of motivation wasn’t extensively explained, but her determination provided enough of an explanation. She was a simple character, but one that felt inseparable to her game, and her small bits of dialogue helped sell the idea that this was someone with a history and a goal, not just a model of a familiar protagonist.\n\nThe more she said though, the harder I was able to buy into the illusion. Her comments began to unsuccessfully break the fourth wall, crack jokes about things that wouldn’t exist in this world, and continue to fail to stick with the game’s attempts to rhyme each line. The oddly written verses are maybe the most distracting thing out of the lot, dropping in and out of rhyme at random, making me question if it was even intentional half the time.\n\nWoolfe doesn’t feel like a game that suffers from an undeveloped vision, it’s one that started with a great idea but had no understanding of how to bring it into existence. That makes it an even bigger disappointment though because I feel that it could be great, if only developer Grin had had more time, or a bigger budget, or more experience. There’s a game somewhere in here that I’m dying to experience, and maybe there’s still some hope that it will appear in part two, but as of now it’s all bark and no bite.\n\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","May 11, 2015","false","2.4"," 130 of 185 people (70%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","70","130","185","4","17"

It was a charming gameplay with good music and a beautiful atmosphere. At times you just want to pause and take in all the details around you. It feels like a twist on a childhood fairy tale and is done in a very whimsical manner. I personally didn't notice too many bugs during my gameplay.

Then it's annoying, then it's really grating, and then it's just terrible. It's gets really forced, and not exactly right, either.\nThe lip-synching is really bad. And I say this *after* the patch that says it improved lip-synching.\nThe combat isn't good. Higher difficulties only add health to enemies and increase how much damage you take. Enemies aren't any smarter, and your attacks don't have any real variety. You do get power moves over the course of the game, but they're hit and miss as far as usefulness goes.\nYou can easily cheese enemies, lead them to a stairwell they can't go down, lure them to a wall they won't cross, stuff like that.\nThe platforming is rough. The camera doesn't help most of the time, there are jumps that are really hard to judge, oh, and plenty of instant death items that don't let you know beforehand that they'll kill you. I say this as someone who completed the original version of Psychonauts' Meat Circus level. This platforming isn't good.\nThis game is also pretty short. I played it on hard, and died a bunch, and it took me maybe 2 hours. I don't know if it's worth $10. I don't feel cheated, but maybe wait for a sale.\n\nOh. And that (&^#)^$^ 'Quicker than GRIN' achievement. If you're timing a level? Maybe don't start the timer before the opening cutscene? And don't let it run while the cutscene is running? UGH. That achievement is making me want to stab things.\n\nI obviously have a bunch of complaints, but this isn't a terrible game, and I can see where they really tried for some good stuff.

From the music, to the details in the background. It all enhances the universe and truly draws you in. The gameplay is unique mixture of side scrolling with 3d elements. You will guide Red as she seeks revenge for her fathers death and faces mechanical foes, puzzles and traps, and other fairy tale character.\nThe combat in Woolfe leaves a bit to be desired. Its simplistic and not overly complicated. With wild slashing sufficing for most situations. The platforming through areas, while beautiful feels hindered by invisible walls and constant instant death scenarios. Rather that be traps or water. The camera is not always your friend when it comes to platforming as well. Despite the aforementioned issues though. Woolfe is still a captivating and very enjoyable game.

And what's worse, is that this is a very short game that ends on a major cliffhanger.\n\nWoolfe's levels are great and very varied. The platforming part of this action platformer really shines and it's a lot of fun having Red double-jump through the levels. Unfortunately most of the levels are also populated by enemies, and there's the action part. The combat in this game is frustratingly annoying. You have a normal and powerful attack, but the powerful attack takes too long to build and is therefore useless since you will get hurt. The normal attack is so weak you will be hammering away and hoping you will not die from counter-attacks -- hope, since there is little indication of an attack occurring and even if you do spot it in time, both jumping and rolling are unreliable to get out of harm's way.\nCombat is enhanced a little by abilities which have to be charged by collecting drops from defeated enemies. Because there are so few levels, these abilities are handed out too late to actually be really useful and even if you do get them you'll basically be spamming them non-stop, then spamming normal attack, ad infinitum.\n\nThis is a game that was Kickstarted and it shows that there was no big budget behind it. The game is rough, and it's really unfortunate because with more polish and more levels it could have been great. As it is now it is definitely not bad, but the game will leave you frustrated over what could have been. Hopefully the developers will learn from the mistakes in this one and finish the story with a better, longer, more polished sequel.\n\nRecommended if you can get it on a discount.","May 14, 2015","true","4.3"," 22 of 25 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","22","25","0","0"

This game is more of an unpolished gem, and the negatives can drown the positives - if you let them. If you can turn a blind eye to the short gameplay and clunky combat you have two-three hours that is well worth the time.\nVisually this game is beautiful, I adored it. My only nay here is the overuse of blurry effects, it sometimes did hide the artistsic positives of this game - which is sad when the artistic visuals are the best part of this game.\nI like how it is attempted to be written in a poetic way. It sometimes did feel forced somehow, like they were thinking "we already started these poetic monologues, but we're not quite sure how to make this line fit in". But for the most part it was well written.\nthis game is short. Everyone is saying it, even the devs are saying it and I'm repeating it. It is short - deal with it. If you're not willing to pay 10dollars for a short game, no matter if you believe it could be worth your time or not then just wait for a sale.\nCombat could have been done better, seriously. Even if it's a product of an indie team it's no excuse for making combat this static.\nI could surely get a feel of Alice - Madness Returns in this game, I'll be pretty surprised if it was not an big inspiration. I would absolutely love to see more of this, hopefully a bit more polished when the continuation is released. I do not regret spending 10$ on this game, and I would do it again had I known the same things about the game as I do now. It might be a steep price for a 2 hours adventure for some, but to me it's well worth the money to support these guys and a few hours of fun.","March 20, 2015","true","2.7"," 27 of 34 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","27","34","0","0"

It boasts a lovely Danny Elfman style soundtrack, decent stylised visuals and a solid enough game concept, but I think that’s where it should have stayed, as a concept, because in practice, Woolfe falls short at every hurdle.\n\nYes, as I’ve already said, the music is pleasant, the game looks nice enough, and even some of the dialogue and flavour text is well done, but the gameplay on offer here is pitiable.\n\nAs a platformer, Woolfe is subpar: floaty controls, poor hit detection on platforms and terrible conveyancing of stage layout – this game has a nasty habit of making you think an area is accessible only for you to die trying to reach it. The 2.5D perspective is interesting and makes for one or two visually pleasing scenes, but adds very little to the overall gameplay and indeed makes the already weak platforming sections more frustrating than they should be. The platforming on offer is bland, predictable and floaty – what mild challenge there is comes from poorly conveyed layouts and cheap deaths due to terrible hit detection. The one saving grace is the inclusion of hidden symbols which unlock diary entries and trivia – this was a passable feature and felt very ‘PS1-era’platformer in its implementation.\n\nThe combat here is even worse, and one of the weakest systems I’ve seen in an action game. You have two attacks, a flurry of light strikes and a single heavy chop. The light attack animation is horribly janky and leaves an obnoxious glowing trail after each swing, while the heavy chop is clunky and dull with little combo potential. Magical power attacks are gained throughout the game and make battles against multiple enemies a little easier, but again they are clunky, slow and uninteresting. Nothing about the combat system in Woolfe is engaging and does nothing to reward you – there are no upgrades, no combos, no timed blocks or parries, just…nothing fun. Enemies don’t have weak spots or different attacks, they’re all the same and they’re all boring. Each enemy encounter is a chore and when you can sneak past them, you should do so, if only to save yourself the headache of actually having to fight. A stealth takedown would have been appreciated too, but, no such luck.\n\nWhile graphically the game is pretty solid, and not something to complain about at all, it is let down by lack of enemy variety (there are about 4) and poor animation quality. Most of the locales look nice and are reasonably diverse. However in such a short game it can be quite hard to cram in too many changes of scenery, so I’ll let that slide. The one aspect of Woolfe that I can wholeheartedly say I enjoyed was the sound design –strongly reminiscent of the Fable series’ quirky fairy-tale tone, the music is hands down the best thing about this game and ranges from melancholic, frozen city streets to bouncy Danny Elfman style chase music. The voice acting for ‘Red’ is also pretty solid and certain lines are delivered particularly well, often when talking wistfully of her past, but the quality is not sustained all the way through.\n\nWhile the quality of writing is reasonably good, the story is convoluted and incomplete. We really learn very little that wasn’t alarmingly obvious by the end, and are left with a giant cliffhanger (though I believe a sequel is in the works). Ultimately though, I just didn’t care. Kudos for trying to revamp a classic fairy tale in a gothic style *cough* American McGee *cough*, but there isn’t enough meat to the story to make you feel invested. It’s poorly focused and decidedly average, which I think is the perfect description for this whole game.\n\nWhat truly baffles me though, is that this game was crowdfunded, beta tested and had some degree of player involvement during its development – how did the game manage to release in this state with such a vested interest behind it? Were the backers of this game really content with something so painfully mediocre? Woolfe was clearly made with love, but sadly, not with expertise or consideration.\n\nOverall, Woolfe is a tragic tale. I wanted to like this game, and was initially intrigued by early trailers, but it simply isn’t good. It attempts to combine platforming, combat, stealth and exploration and subsequently fails to make either individual aspect compelling or rewarding. The weak experience is compounded by bugs, janky animations and a painfully thin amount of shallow content. Despite a very nice soundtrack, Woolfe – The Red Hood Diary is little more than bundle fodder and acts simply as a cautionary tale of how not to make a game.\n\nPros:\n+Excellent soundtrack\n+Decent Visuals\n\nCons:\n-Everything Else\n\nScore: 3/10","July 14, 2015","false","1.8"," 32 of 43 people (74%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","74","32","43","5","0"

I really loved the theme and story. Having a badass female protagonist in a dystopic fairy-tale is simply my thing.\n\nWhat I really liked about this game is:\n+ Voice acting - it was sooo good.\n+ Narration - unlike many other people, I enjoyed the rhyming sentences really really much. <3\n+ Character and environment design.\n+ Art style.\n+ Music.\n\nNow let's get to the things that I didn't like.\n\nThere were quite a few bugs and game parts left unpolished here and there. It was obvious that the developers didn't spend enough time for usability/playability testing and QA. Even though it was still playable, controlling a character in a 2.5D world was a major distress when you cannot move the camera to see the positions of the platforms. Jumping on the wrong place because I couldn't see where exactly the other moving platform on the XZ plane, dying and spawing from the last checkpoint which is literally on the other side of the world has made me lose lots of time. And also, it made me want to ragequit maybe a 4328732 times.\n\nAnother big problem was that enemies not having a health bar in combat, unless they're a boss. It doesn't affect playability that much, though.\n\nI am actually surprised that this game got that many negative reviews. Indie games usually have myriad drawbacks mostly because of the lack of experience and resources. Still, the game is very short, and you are the one to decide if it's worth paying for a game having many issues. However, I found the good sides of this game strong and I would recommend it.  Definitely, worth giving it a try.\n\nNote: I did not play the game that long.

So i kinda end up compering both games. To be said, i really (!) loved Alice: Madness Returns.

When ever you just stop, you get the feeling you're looking at an artwork.\nThe GAMEPLAY in a nutshell is buttonsmash-action mixed with some basic plattforming. And it turns out to be really fun!\nThe game feels very smooth. As soon as you start you just get into a flow and run through the game like you were born to do so. The plattforming part is not that challenging, but also not boring. The dev's managed to get a really balanced mix between action and plattforming.\nThe COMBAT is not really difficult. You have 2 basic attacks, 1 dodgemove and 4 combo-moves. Those combined the combat feels very smooth and is fun, but it's not really challenging. Once you understand your moves and the enemy-behavior you can outplay very easy every single enemy in the game, without any problems.\nThe STORYLINE is exciting and a bit different from the fairy tales, but you'll have to find out more about it yourself!\n\nAll in all i can say i really enjoyed this game. Woolfe gets points deduction from me, because:\n(1) there are still some bugs, which disrupts the game flow;\n(2) even on hard difficulty the game isn't really much harder; and\n(3) you'll have this game finished pretty fast.\nSo in my opinion you will get a very cool game, with high quality content, for just 10 bucks. There are way more expensive games, with way less content, and way less quality. I had a lot of fun playing this game and really enjoyed it, and i am really looking forward to get the next part of this series!\n\nBuy recommendation for genre fans - hardcore plattformers and story enthusiast might want to wait till its on sale.","March 21, 2015","true","27.3"," 18 of 20 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","18","20","0","0"

She is determined, she is ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off, and she carries an axe. This game was so much fun to play, I was actually surprised by it. Visually it looks nice, but is a bit linear. The story is interesting and all in all I think they did a pretty good job with the game. According to the developers blog, they are interested in creating a second part to this game, so for those who think the story isn't as long as it should be, I suppose a Red Hood Diaries 2 may make up for the shortness of this game.","July 17, 2015","true","4.6"," 17 of 22 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","17","22","0","0"

The soundtrack was very good, and the graphics were extremely well-done. I absolutely loved this gaming world and would love to see more of it.\n\nThere were a few things that caught my attention and felt a little "off." The first is how the character moves, very grid-like on straight and diagonal lines. Everything about this world is "sharp" visually speaking, as part of the steampunk and angular design, so I wonder if Red's movement was also intentional and reflective of this. If it's intentional, it's certainly cohesive, but it does feel a bit odd at times, because it takes practice lining up jumps and combat. There were many times that I'd be firmly on one edge jumping to another and end up in the water or some other unseen abyss. The same goes for combat, because there were a few times that I didn't understand why I was taking damage, why my hits weren't landing, or why I hit something I never should have hit.\n\nI loved the world, but I will admit that there were times when the environment made my path unclear. Gamers rely on certain cues to tell us where the developers intend for us to go, and in this case, the scenery muddles that a bit. There is a compromise, though, because I noticed that certain surfaces will flash, like a reflection, to indicate intended pathways, and of course, you can use the magic skill which draws your attention to items in the immediate vicinity that are of interest.\n\nI had one issue during gameplay that actually was confounding, and that was during the Woolfe Industries stage. There's a box that you're supposed to knock down that creates a gap on the left side of the building, but mine would never break even with restarts. I had to jump on top of it to get to the sign, and I took damage when jumping down below. It wasn't a huge deal, but it was something I could never figure out.\n\nOn the positive side, the story leaves room for continuation, and I really enjoyed my first playthrough. The platforming elements are such that a casual player won't get frustrated, yet the Steam achievements, though attainable, do come bit of challange and are likely to appeal to a more avid gamer.\n\nThe terrific world design meant that there was plenty of "eye-candy" to keep my attention. The minor oddities I pointed out did not detract from my gameplay, and I enjoyed it enough that I would purchase a sequel. I also look forward to a second playthrough.\n\n*This review is featured on the curator page of Good Games Giveaways & Reviews.","January 20","true","14.7"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tejan/recommended/281940/","tejan","Tejan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tejan/","450 products in account","Yet another indie game that shows so much promise, but falls flat.\n\nPros:The set pieces are very well done, there are a few texture bugs here and there but overall I have to say that this game's setting looks really well done.\nThe game's keys are full rebindable and it handles just as good on a keyboard. Sadly, you cannot rebind controller keys.\nCons:The game is short, I beat it on hard in ~2 hours. I should be able to 100% it in ~4 hours assuming it all goes smoothly.\nThe characters are all over the place in model quality. Woolfe and the soliders look really good. In contrast, Red looks just dreadful with awkward proportions, tons of clipping, and poor texture work.\nThe animation quality is extremely poor as well. Fighting feels boring due to lack of weight to both you and the your opponents' movements, cutscenes become almost humourous due to the lack of facial expression (I was cracking up during the ending cutscene, when Red was over her grandmother's bed as she's wounded, because it was supposed to be a serious and sad moment but Red is sitting there looking like a bored teenage.), and Red's one death animation is to just ragdoll which is weird to see when you accidentally touch a saw blade.\nThe platforming is mediocre at best, but the odd depth of field in the game and the inclusion of tons of instant death traps doesn't help it at all.\nFor up until you reach the forest the camera should have few errors, since it's locked on Red, but once you need to start making leaps of faith on floating platforms the game starts to become a bit less fun. Also, in the last fight, for some reason the camera locked right on top of the lake and was taking up most of the screen with the bridge or rock, so I had to play the boss fight while holding down one of my buttons for the camera.\nThe combat in this game is bad, not the worst possible, but not good. There's no real feedback on when Red is hit, the enemy attacks are all very small movements so it's hard to see when you aren't closer to the camera, and there's no reason to do anything other than mash light attack and use the magic slam attack.\nThe health and magic bars, while pretty to look at, don't convey how much health and mana you currently have. I personally was baited into believe I had more health than I did due to the health bar being wider at the bottom.\nAlso, the health and mana pickups aren't great either. Red isn't very magnetic so you often have to walk over them to grab, but what's worse is that you can pick these up while you're full. Add that onto the fact that they disappear very quickly and you have a system that doesn't allow for you to setup a battlefield so that you have a safe zone where you can run away and recover.\nThe entire magic system in the game just feels bad. You can't continually use a skill, in fact you can't even use a skill again unless you leave the slow-mo, but due to this slow-mo effect taking forever to end and draining your mana continuously you can usually only use two skills at max mana.\nI strongly dislike that the game forces you to use these skills as soon as you learn them. You usually hit enemies when you're forced to use them, but in the Woolfe fight you just swing at air and waste a bar of mana for nothing.\nThe story is cliche, it just mashes together a bunch of these fairy tales and throws them into one universe, it's like Shrek but it's trying to be all dark and brooding. It also suffers from the "I'll explain later" issue that quite a few new games do nowadays. I did think that the game being told in rhyme was kind of cute at first, but as the game went on the rhyme scheme became less consistent making it feel like they tried to force it towards the end.\nThe voice acting is hit or miss. Red's voice actress did a good job as a whole, but the delivery is off in quite a few lines.\nThis might be my fault for not reading that this game is split in two parts, but it just ends on a cliff hanger. This was the biggest slap to the face for me, I struggled through the game on hard, why I played hard first is beyond me, and after failing the Woolfe fight 5 times I managed to just beat him as he was about to attack, I was excited to atleast get closure on the game, but the game just ended no resolutions to anything.\n\nOverall, I'd say this game feels deserving of it's mid 50 score on Metacritic. The game just doesn't feel good to play, it's like an odd mixture of Crash Bandicoot and Sonic Boom.\nWell here's to hoping that the issues I have are fixed for the second half of the game.","May 14, 2015","false","4.0"," 19 of 28 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","19","28","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gwwtbg/recommended/281940/","gwwtbg","gwwtbg","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gwwtbg/","185 products in account","Woolfe is a decent 2.5D hack'n'slash platformer. The story is a darker reimagining of the classic fairy tale about Red Riding Hood (although, considering that in the first published version, penned by Perrault, both Granny and Red die and the tale is essentially a warning to girls about the dangers of sexual predators, the original is pretty dark to begin with...). Red has lost both her parents and blames evil dictator B.B. Woolfe (big bad wolf) for it. She is on the search for revenge, which she plans to deliver with a sharp axe. On the way towards Woolfe, she cuts down a few dozen tin soldiers and aggressive rats, as well as a mini-boss in the form of Pied Piper.\n\nThe main selling point of the game is its art style -- the game is visually very impressive. The combat is ok and the boss battles are not very difficult (unless you're playing on hard difficulty, in which case the final boss battle will require a few retries). The platforming is not particularly demanding for the most part, there are a couple of timed sequences but there is enough time to complete the challenges without too much frustration. For those obsessed with collecting every secret they can find in a level, there are emblems scattered here and there which unlock diary entries (mostly information expanding on the story and characters). Many are easy to miss when going through a level for the first time, but it is easy to reload an earlier chapter and find them all; redoing a level doesn't take long as levels are pretty short.\n\nThat is also the main drawback to the game -- it is very short. I repeatedly re-did earlier chapters in order to find everything and get as many achievements as I could, so it took me about 6.5 hours to complete the game. But if you are not going for achievements and secrets, it can be finished in a couple of hours. Some may feel this length doesn't justify the price, but I think 10 euros is fair considering how much work obviously went into the game. If you're worried about the length, maybe wait for the game to go on sale, but Woolfe is worth playing.","March 19, 2015","true","7.5"," 15 of 21 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","15","21","0","2"

The embodiment of games that wear an expensive coat of superior graphical fidelity but play like a cheap throw away fished from a Salvation Army bin for the needy.\n\nWoolfe is not a complete bust by far.  The game has many redeeming qualities. In addition to superior art direction, Woolfe's narration, story, music and sound serve to demonstrate the amazing work that indie studios can pump out on small budgets.\n\nWoolfe was an early access resident but it's game-play didn't finish paying the mortgage and the end result is an eviction.\n\nWoolfe - The Red Hood Diaries is only the initial installment.

I thought that I had addressed this in our game description on the store page and by setting a reasonably low launch price.

"\n\n"Yeah, playtime seems to be on a lot of peoples minds... We thought the lower price setting would justify that.

Many a developer has utilized such opportunities to enhance.  I'm hoping the developer is wise enough to take a step back before putting their next foot forward.","March 26, 2015","false","4.4"," 37 of 62 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","37","62","0","11"

A bit rough around the edges, but a beautiful treasure to adore. Let me get in on it a bit deeper, okay?\n\nFirst off, I love the concept. After the "Hoodwinked" movie, is this the best attempt to retell the story of Little Red Riding Hood. In a completely new way, I might add. Instead of being a little girl, who gets swallowed whole by a big bad wolf, you're a young woman (quite an attractive one, I'd say) out for revenge on BB Woolfe. Clever, right?\n\nThen, the visuals. This game has a bit of a grimy, yet magical fairytale like look to it. The cold of winter makes the whole scene even darker and just.. plain cold... BB Woolfe is a human, but man, does he look awesome! They really made him a man who represents a wolf, with the facial hair and the fur coat. Wonderful! The red of Red's hood sticks out pretty nicely against the environment. You're clearly the protaganist of this story, which is not a fairytale. After all, there is nothing fair about it.\n\nThen there is the combat. It is kinda choppy (not just because you use an axe as your primary weapon). To me, it all boiled down to tapping the attack buttons multiple times to hit hard and swift, with minimum damage to myself. It works, kinda, but even the smallest of rats manage to sneak in a hit before I can kill them. That's a slight oversight, but really all I can complain about.\n\nThe characters are lovely. Well, there are only four, not counting the robotic soldiers. Red is clever, cunning and pretty witty. She can make lovely snide comments, even to the game designers at some point. I really loved that :)\nWoolfe is dark. You can tell he is a man of power who does everything to stay in control. You don't get to see him often, but you can just feel his prescense everywhere.\nGranny is.. well.. granny. She is the only family Red has left and is not the fragile old lady the books make her out to be. She is pretty strong, almost capable of holding her own in these troubling times.\nAnd there is the Pied Piper. He is just a coward that serves as a mid-way boss... He has a backstory, of luring in little girls and such, but I think he could've been expended upon better.\n\nAnyway, if you're in doubt of buying this game, or not, just do it. The game does end in a cliffhanger (SPOILER) and there probably won't be a second game any time soon, since the company who made it, sadly, had to file bankrupcy...","August 11, 2015","true","2.7"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

It's a nice game for a few quid and a couple hours of your time. Full price though.... maybe have a good think about it first.\n\nStory:\nThe narrative is simple, which I like. Although there are clear plans for a sequel, the story does not touch on as many aspects of the traditional fairy tale as it could have. Excellent concept, but needs some more depth and expansion. Things seem a little jumbled; The instances of "magic" don't fit into the overall aesthetic of the game; perhaps more context there would give us a better idea of the world we're playing in.\n\nLength:\nThe game is exceedingly short. Two bosses and several frustrating platforming levels later, I'm disappointed at the abrupt ending and "cliffhanger".\n\nVisuals:\nStunning. The visuals are excellent! Loved the steampunk/gothic victorian vibe in the city surroundings. The Forest Areas however, arrive in the story quite abruptly with very little context. The 3D elements are excellent, and interesting, challenging at some parts as well. However, it probably would have been better to introduce it more gradually as a SECTION of the forest which was cursed, enchanted or ruined by Woolfe. Overall though, very visually appealing and stylistic.\n\nControls:\nDamn, you need a controller for this one! No doubt about it. Keyboard is not a good idea. With an actual controller, controls are simple and varied enough to keep you interested. However, I have to complain about the frustrations concerning combos - To me, mashing combo moves in combat should be allowed whenever possible to retalliate against enemies who are powerful, rather than at sch specific points in combat. Not sure if others were having difficulties, but I found myself pressing buttons for combos and having my commands ignored.\n\nJumping and legdes etc - would have been nice to have been able to jump on top of more objects and have a better aspect of exploration. Sometimes there are issues with jumping on particular ledges you should be easily able to get onto.\n\nDialogue:\nSome lip sync and dialogue boo boos in the final scene which is disappointing. After battling Woolfe, it's a well deserved cutscene which could have been better executed. During the Woolfe battle, I might add, there is a lack of dialogue/ sound effects from Granny at appropriate moments. Gasping or screaming after her being grabbed would have been a nice (and necessary) addition.\n\nThings to note:\nLoved the animation, the stunning visuals and the variety of different level viewpoints in the game. There is a lot of variance in the angles for the platforming levels, which I actually quite enjoyed. Definitely worth a play if you want something pretty, but if you like a deep and lengthy story campaign with plenty of characters to delve into, maybe it isn't your cuppa tea!\n\nTL;DR\nNice visuals, basic controls, great platforming gameplay with some frustrating parts, TOO. DAMN. SHORT. Would have loved more story in there.","May 18, 2015","true","5.3"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","8","9","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198070887333/recommended/281940/","76561198070887333","The Fortune Teller","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198070887333/","73 products in account","Let me start by saying that I am a huge fan of twisted retellings of classic fairytales, so the moment I noticed that a twisted version of Red Riding Hood was being created as a videogame, I was very excited. That aside, this game is quite tricky for me to review, so I will do my best.\n\nFor starters, the story is quite interesting. It takes place in an industial city called Ulrica, which has heavy steampunk elements, and it follows Red Riding Hood as she tries to solve the mystery of her father's death. Industrial tycoon B.B. Woolfe is ruling over the city using his mechanized soldiers, and it is Red's mission to infiltrate his archives and find out if her father's death, who was working for Woolfe at the time, was really an accident, or if foul play was involved. It will probably maintain your interest, and I found Red's delivery of her and her family's backstory through rhymes really amusing. There are also a lot of collectibles that add more depth to the lore of the city and many of the characters.\n\nMoving on, the art style is amazing and goes a long way in creating a wonderful, eerie but enchanting atmosphere. The empty city of Ulrica is a marvel to behold: the lonely houses covered in snow, the worn out boats and the cold lake water that runs through the town, everything adds to the feeling of isolation and constant danger that Red is experiencing. The dim candle lights that glow from the house windows, the posters of children that went missing, all these details come together to create a threatening, but at the same time strangely alluring atmosphere of mystery.\n\nMusic-wise, I believe the composers did an amazing job in making the players feel as if they are playing in a dark fairytale. They dressed up the game quite nicely, with slow, low melodies when Red is moving through the town, undetected, and more intense pieces when she is hunted by enemies, or is in a dire situation.\n\nNow for the bad stuff.\n\nAt times, the controls are unresponsive, specificaly when it comes to jumping. There were several times when I lost my life simply because Red did not jump over a gap, although I had pressed "space". I have seen that this is a common point of complaint from other players as well. Keep in mind that I played the game using a keyboard, so maybe this is not a problem when playing with a controller.\n\nAnother problem is the camera. The developers themselves have said that, originaly, the game was to be a 2D platformer before they decided to move it to complete 3D. However, it seems as if the 3D part was added after they had developed a major part of the game with a 2D mentality, and this has created depth perception problems. There will be times when Red will need to jump to a platform that is in the backround, but the camera will remain in 2D mode, making it extremelly difficult to understand if your jump will be succesful or not.\n\nA third problem was the second half of the game. Although, visually, it is one of the most beautiful things I have ever seen, there is a sudden spike in platforming difficulty that feels a bit cheap. The depth perception problem and jumping issue mentioned above make it extremelly hard to traverse the various, deadly platforming set pieces. I found myself dying endlessly in that part, and I have had a lot of experience with platformers. I kind of felt as if they made it like that on purpose, just to add a bit more time to the game.\n\nSpeaking of time, the game is extremely short. It took me two hours to finish it, and that is with all the dying I experienced in the second part.\n\nFinally, I did not particularly like the ending. I know the game was supposed to be released in two volumes, but I still wanted to have at least a bit more information before its end, since it created more questions than gave answers.\n\nTo conclude, yes, I do recommend this game. It has its problems, but it also has an undeniable charm, especialy if you are into twisted retellings of fairytales, like I am. As a platformer, you will find better games out there, but it is decent in that department, and the setting makes it even more appealing, despite its flaws. I was saddened to hear that the developers went bankrupt, and I wish them the best in whatever they do next. However, good news is that the game was bought by Rebelion, a well known company, so there is still hope for a continuation of this tale.\n\nHopefully, Red will eventually live happily ever after. :)","October 23, 2015","true","3.6"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

Music was also nice, blends in seamlessly with the dark gothic theme.\n\nNow we come to the story and this is where it falls short, Red herself was rather lacking, I would have preferred a few supporting characters to help flesh out her character and enhance the overall story and although Red does talk about her past maybe some flashbacks on her childhood to really make us connect with her. Luckily the diary entries (if you find them) help immensely in making the story more enjoyable. It doesn't help that the bad guys have no lines whatsoever and are always silent. Although BB Wolf has diary entries to flesh out his character, it kinda killed his character when he is made to be a "silent puppet" without asserting his presence. The ending leaves a lot to be desired too although it can be argued that this is just Chapter 1 of many chapters, I still felt the ending could have been handled better\n\nComing to combat, i'm not a fan of platformers but that aside I didn't really have trouble with enemies, even on hard, in fact they are rather stupid. The game is forgiving, except for 1 area (A Forest Adrift) which is mildly challenging. Red's combat moves are pretty simplistic, a light and hard hit plus 4 special moves, very little variation and I found myself only using the same special move over and over again.\n\nDespite it's shortcoming i strongly believe this game is more good than bad, while maybe too short for the full price, definitely grab this on a sale.","October 2, 2015","true","10.4"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

(I don't wanna spoil the game)\nso the storyline for the game is kinda weak in terms of finding it attracting and failing to suck you into the action or even feel the characters in the game, So I am giving this game 5 outta 10 cuz' it failed to impress me since I thought that this game is going to have a really deep original storyline.\n\n\nGameplay 6/10:-\n\nThe game offers sadly a very linear gameplay you just go in kill bunch and then go to the next map, And when there is some enemies that you cannot beat easily the game actually has bugs in it you could use them to kill these enemies, The point is this game wanted to offer you a good combo system and a flexable gameplay mechanisim but it actually failed in my opinion.\n\n\nGraphics 6/10:-\n\nYou could easily go back a few years and get a game that actually looks  better BUT let's not see it this way, So the thing is this game has a really good atmosphere but sadly it's badly designed and tried to make you feel the game, So It's good for let's say an average game but maybe they could make it better so you get sucked into the game more and more.\n\n\nAudio 8/10:-\n\nThe only thing that this game really make it's shine is the soundtracks! It actually blew my mind that this game had anything that good in my opinion and it has like that dark ish theme that could make you feel like you are reading or watching a movie of the Red, I really liked it and it's beautifully made! Good job.\n\n\nMain Character 7/10:-\n\nWell what to say, The whole design of the Red is actually ugly I mean look at her eyes they are so scary in an ugly way when the game's cover has Red looking scary in a good way or you can say a "cool way" but sadly when I started the game and looked at her I was like "what the hell is this?!", I hoped for a really awesome Red but sadly the answer was NO.\n\n\nVoice Acting 8/10:-\n\nAnother thing that this game makes it well is also audio related, The vocie acting is actually really good in my opinion and you can easily blend yourself in listening to Red talking and making jokes about every damn thing!\n\n\n==============\nFinal Score:- 6.6/10 (Time killer)\n\nSo in the end I hope you guys can see the game and MAYBE you can enjoy it better than I actually did in terms of that humans can differ in their own opinions, So I hope you liked the review and found it reasonable somehow!\nAnd to the people who were actually complaining about how short the game is , Yes I am totally with you guys and we hope to see the Red one day back again with more content and better desgining !\n\nByebye <3","May 7, 2015","true","2.4"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","9","11","0","0"

However, it fell flat in enjoyment level for me simply because there were way too many problems that I had with it and not enough areas that I found good. I started out being really into it, but quickly started wishing for the game to be finished already (especially considering that I was already aware of how short it is). Overall, I think the game could have been really amazing but I don't recommend it as it is, and as it will remain because of the series being dropped.\n\nPROS\n- The visuals were great and most definitely the best part of the game, particularly the world design. I think that this part of the game was what was worked on the most and I can obviously appreciate how beautiful it is because, hey, who doesn't want the game they're playing to look nice? The forest area with the gravity defiance was really pretty and I almost wish that that could have been explored more (with better platforming, at least).\n- I liked Red's character design a lot for the most part, truthfully I like concept art of her more than her in-game model but that's mentioned more in the cons section.\n- Interesting use of rhyming dialogue that fit the fairy tale genre.\n- Red's voice acting was satisfactory, I mostly just liked the way her voice sounded rather than how it was in general.\n\nCONS\n- Regarding Red's design, I feel as if she would have looked a whole lot better without the scarily big eyes that didn't feel like they were shaded properly (the whites of her eyes were rather freaky, it felt like her eyes were designed normally and then just blown up way too much for the final product).\n- The rhyming dialogue was sometimes forced and felt off, definitely wasn't very immersive after a while of playing the game.\n- The landscape depth or view and perspective was really disorienting for me. Often times it felt hard to tell what was an area I could interact with and what wasn't, and there were several instances where I believed I was landing on a platform but apparently wasn't simply from the camera angle being off. This fact could be rather frustrating especially alongside the fact that there were many instant death interactions that you had no warning of whatsoever. Needless to say, I died a lot simply from the platforming itself.\n- The combat was clunky and at times felt unfair. There were a number of attacks from enemies that killed me in one hit out of the blue, but even aside from that it could be hard to manage attacking and dodging safely because your weapon accuracy and the hitboxes of your attacks and the bodies of your enemies seem to bug out a lot. The special attacks you get throughout the game are highly unreliable as they miss more often than not, and you're not given much direction as to their usage being limited by whatever "mana/energy" concept was used in the game.\n- The story was interesting, but felt so rushed. It really feels like the game could have been a whole lot longer simply from having the story drawn out so that players could experience more of it. I understand that this was only the first part of the game that was planned out to be a series, but regardless I think there could have been more added for the aspects of the plot that were developed.","September 29, 2015","false","3.1"," 27 of 45 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","27","45","2","0"

First off, $10 is more than a fair price for this title. The world they created is just gorgeous. Story wise, an interesting twist on a classic fairy tale. It reminds me of the  play Alice: Madness Returns had (A game I also vastly enjoyed; but w/ a much bigger budget ofcourse). This was to be a great introduction to a sequel that now won't see a release to to poor sales, which is beyond me as ppl spend 3 times as much for less passionate AAA titles.

It is sad that the Company decided to call it quits before completing more chapters of this game, but at least they provided a nice explaination.

I backed this game on Kickstarter with 30€ after the Gamescom presentation sold me on it. I backed this game hoping to get something like American McGee's Alice or the sequel of that, Alice: Madness Returns. It measures up to that in no way, so if you're looking for something like that, stay away and wait for someone else.\n\nTerrible things:\n-The game is over after two hours. Max.\n-Most of these two hours were spent dying to incomprehensible combat gameplay, incomprehensible jumping puzzles and being set back by ridiculously spaced checkpoints in the middle of both of those.\n-There are forced stealth sections with one-hit-kill immortal enemies. These pass quickly, but only because the whole game does.\n-The story both has no real beginning and no end, managing to end on a cliffhanger after this absurdly short playtime.\n-The story contradicts itself, parts of the backstory given for Red in the beginning of the story do not match up with the backstory elaborated on in the end of the story.\n-None of the characters develop at all, small wonder in the tiny time this game goes on.\n-The combat gameplay consists of "wail on the enemy, do a combat roll / back away / jump away, eat a hit or two, repeat until one of you falls over" with no tactics or skill involved. Dying enemies drop lots of health so this is apparently known to the devs. There are no difficulty settings either. When you get mobbed and made the mistake of jumping, you can sometimes float on the enemies while being unable to make contact with the ground. SInce you can only attack while on the ground they will wail on you and most likely kill you when this happens.\n-No facial animations whatsoever even while the rest of the body is animated, even during cutscenes. Uncanny valley hello.\n-Occasional bugs, of various severity. During the final boss fight my subtitles switched from English to what looked like Danish or Dutch.\n\nGood things:\n-The design is stylish and the graphics look pretty.\n\nSubjective things:\n-The dialogue rhymes from time to time, whenever the devs seem to have felt like making some rhymes. I don't really care but the rhymes may be cringeworthy to you because some of them bend the pronounciation quite a bit.\n\nIt ends on a CLIFFHANGER, with a sequel planned for some time later this year.

It was funded by Kickstarter and has been on Steam Greenlight early access, the games official released on 17/03.2015. The game takes the Red Riding Hood fairy tale and twists it into a dark revenge fantasy that sees are heroin take her axe to the mechanical army of B.B.Woolfe.\nimage\nStory:\n\nThe story is well written, using fairy tales we all know and twisting them into something altogether darker and more sinister. Lets be clear this may essentially be a platform game but Sonic it is not, this is not a game for children. But also its no survival horror ether, its like Tim Burton does Red Riding Hood with violence. And if you are a Tim Burton fan you’ll be right at home with this style of story telling. It also bares some resemblance to DC’s Fables that we’ve already had the game Wolf Among Us.\n\nGameplay:\nWoolfe is what the developers call a 2.5D game, what this means is though you can move in 3D the levels are done in layers with you only travelling on one plane at any moment. Its an interesting idea that for the most part works pretty well. Though there is the occasional odd camera angle, its rare enough not to mire the experience. Like all platform games there are frustrating moments where whatever you do you just cant seem to make a jump or get past a enemy. But it plays well and is a pretty enjoyable experience. There are a few areas that could do with polish mind, for instance the game doesn’t always give you a clear direction where to go. Now I’m not saying it should spell it out for us, just that in some areas the game almost seem to guide you in completely the wrong direction. I also came across a few glitches, nothing huge but it can be frustrating just falling clean through a platform you landed perfectly on. Thankfully these glitches are few and far between, there not persistent and will no doubt be fixed in future updates. My last grip and really an expected one is the game is short, this is an evening of play not even a day. But the game is the first part and not a full title and a £6.99 you expect this, but I enjoyed it and really wanted more.\n\nPresentation:\nThis is where Woolfe really shines, you don’t expect this kind of polish from a Kickstarter game. There are maybe only three enemy models excluding bosses and maybe three variations of those models, but it doesn’t become stale at all. The levels are wonderfully designed and Red herself is really stylized in an almost anime way, there’s a huge amount of work gone into the art and style of Woolfe. So much so at times its very easy to forget that this isn’t a triple A title, but a Greenlight one. There are a few animation quirks but unless like me your looking for them, you’ll probably never even notice.\nI’ve very much fallen for the style of Woolfe, and though the style is nothing new its been done so well. The artist/team who designed it really should get special recognition for there work.\n\nConclusion:\nI really enjoyed Woolfe. Though its pretty clear there is a case of style over substance here, the substance is pretty good too. I do wish it was longer, but I knew what to expect going in. The issues and glitches I experienced didn’t harm the experience what so ever and I will be playing this game lots more. I hope that GRIN don’t keep us waiting too long for the second installment and in the mean time I would advise you to go get yourself a copy from steam too. It’s no Skyrim or GTA5, but its good fun and I really liked it.\n\nIf you liked this review, check out http://www.cyberusuk.com/post/113994791258/woolfe-the-red-hood-diaries-by-grin-review for more.","March 31, 2015","true","4.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I know from several of people that the story and the art is beautiful, which to me is very important when playing a game.\n\nHowever, I can see why there are several of bad reviews.\n\nYes, the game is only about 2 hours long (I haven't even played that long of it, I'll explain why), but it's only because there's only one chapter out (and at this point, will be the only one out ever, unless someone buys the IP). GRIN planned to add more chapters on, I believe similar to how Telltale Games does the releases of their episodes. With about 5-6 chapters planned, it would've been worth the $9.\n\nBut! Unfortunately, there are far too many bugs and glitches in the game that makes it irritating and to some point unplayable. When I have Red move forward, her animation will appear as if she was moving the other direction. And her model is constantly making this twitch like move. The camera shifts are horrid, which has so far caused me the most deaths (from falling because I couldn't see where I was going).\n\nThe story is super interesting so far, from what I've played, and the artwork is beautiful, but it's unplayable.\n\nI really hope someone does buy off the IP and continue this game because it has a lot of potential. Hopefully they will fix whatever bugs and glitches there are in the game as well or perhaps make it all new altogether. Who knows. But for right now, I'll try to keep on playing it, so long as I don't lose my patience.\n\nThe only way I'll reccommend this game is because the developers are in serious debt and need whatever help they can get. And also to keep hope that enough people are interested in this game so someone can pick it up and continue it.","August 16, 2015","true","0.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The story is like a grim fairy tale version of red riding hood with Red as a vengeful young woman looking to find out what happened to her parents in a small town ruled by the big bad Woolfe.  It reminded me of a simplified version of Alice: Madness Returns or Blades of Time (both games that I really enjoyed).  The graphics are very pretty, making it fun to explore each area, and even though the gameplay is fairly short, I still felt immersed in the world and the story.  I definitely recommend collecting all of the journal entries and reading them because they add a lot to the story that isn't necessarily told during the traditional gameplay and are also pretty well written.  There are a few bugs here and there that can be frustrating, but I still really enjoyed the game, overall.\n\nUnfortunately the devs went bankrupt, so we'll likely never see volume 2 of this game unless someone buys the rights, but I just wanted to add a positive voice of support for this game because I did really enjoy it...","August 22, 2015","true","8.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I was impressed at the beginning but as the game progressed, the lousy respawn points really spoilt my impression of the game. There are only 2 voice actors in the whole game, Red and her grandmother. Other characters like B.B. Wolfe and the Pied Piper just say nothing.\n\nPROS\n1. Storytelling Style\nThe narrative is told by Little Red Riding Hood in a rhyming fashion. It's pretty good when it rhymes but horrible at all the other times.\n\n2. Background Foreground Interaction\nI love the way you can move back and forth from the foreground to the background. It's unintuitive to do with keyboard controls but I found a way around it.\n\nCONS\n1. Bugs\nLots of them, I took the screenshots and uploaded them to Steam.\n\n2. Controls\nThey didn't port it over properly. I couldn't see my health and mana bars at all.\n\n3. Game Time\nIt's so short and I played it on Hard mode. It took only 2 hours. This was crap.\n\n4. Respawn Points\nIf you die, the respawn points can take you all the way back to the beginning. Chapters cannot start from mid way, they must start from the beginning.\n\n5. The Combos\nYou only use the Wolf Claw at the very last stage against Wolfe and that's where you get the last combo. You only use it for 1 battle and it's not even necessary to win.\n\n6. Uncompleted Game\nJust based on the "To be Continued" ending, I am most disappointed. The story is meant to go on with Red saving Ulrica. and you using all the combos. You might even find out that Red is somehow related to B.B. Wolfe even. It is hinted that her mother was ♥♥♥♥♥ before being put in the mines.\n\nThe fact that there are over 100 Kickstarter supporters for this game really disappoints me the most. You didn't even complete the game with so many supporters.","January 17","false","2.9"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","2"

If you ever had a fencing lesson where you weren't allowed to block or if you read about Johann Liechtenauer's school of sword fighting you are probably set.\nThe life-bar is pretty short, so basically, don't get hit. Life regenerates when outside of battle.\n\nThere are no upgrades but you "learn" a number of special moves which are, well, of no use to me. Their higher damage is accompanied by a too long recovery time, and the base attack, although a bit weaker, gives good control over a fight.\nI put "learn" in quotes because: 1. You can only execute specials in the in-game chronology after the game tells you about them; and 2. the game makes you invariably re-learn the special whenever you pass the corresponding point in a level, complete with game pause and the requirement to execute the "new" skill in order to make the tutorial screen go away.\n\nAt times I fell through the map.\nOnce while running with wolves, I tried to roll out from under a tree, dropped through the pass and died - guess which achievement I was going for at the time.\nThe other occurrence is repeatable and in the sewers. To the right of the mirrored time challenge there is a tunnel where you can see the tip of a boat's bow. When jumping into the tunnel and then double-jumping as far right as possible I fell through the top water plane without dying (but usually taking fall damage). I could, then underwater, walk around the pillars carrying the elements of the room above the surface. I'd die when getting too close to those crushers or burners, or when getting under the next water plane to the left.\n\nThe game is a short, just around three hours for a simple playthrough and about twice that for completion.\n\nWhen the 3D platforming had to stand the trial of repetition it became slightly infuriating. Basically you have to jump from one irregularly shaped object to another irregularly shaped object without another plane of correspondence. So there is a good chance you'll misjudge jumps. For the speedrun you just have to learn.\n\nI recommend Woolfe, The Red Hood Diaries because after all it was interesting, fun and satisfying. If you are are worried about length of the game, I suggest buying it at a discount.","September 5, 2015","true","6.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

So I will tell you plainly the good things, bad things and neutral facts.\n\n-Bad:\nThe game is SHORT, and this is bad only because the game itself is really good. I believe that everyone who played it want more of it. It took me only half a day to run the game through. But still, even short as this, this game definately costs the money I paid for it.\n\n=Neutral:\nNo mouse needed, keyboard is enough, though game seems to be optimized for controller (which is certainly also supported).\n\nGood:\n+Storyline. Well, not exactly a storyline itself, rather the way you are getting it. If it was written in a book as a plain text, it would be not so interesting, but playing through this storyline is totally different thing.  In fact, the only thing that stopped me from closing the game on some difficult locations was a desire to see what happens next.\n+Rhymes. Probably I should even go further and say poetry. Coupled with truly amazing voice actor's work, it really makes this game outstanding, and I was really enjoying it all the way through the game.\n+The game sound is really good, I have already told about how good are main character's monologues, and the music helps a lot in creating special atmosphere for every location. The sound is a big part of overall impression about this game.\n+Decent graphics, powered by Unreal engine.\n+Badass Red Riding Hood with a big axe and vengeful determination. This single thing is enough to buy the game.\n\nEnjoy it!\nI really did.","November 16, 2015","true","2.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The short length makes the game less annoying and that is why I recommend it.\nWoolfe is Red Riding Hood and American McGee put into a blender and poured out. The visuals, dark story and platforming all come from Alice.  The platforming is okay, but can be kind of sluggish. The game has very good voice acting from the voice actress.\nMy main problem with this game is the Axe.  It is the worst weapon I ever played with in a hack and slash platformer. It is incredibly weak and there is something that is sluggish about Red’s Axe.  Red can be also very annoying because the writing is horrible. Who thought the tag line was a good idea to say aloud in the game, not once, but twice.

This crew has the ability to make a good game, this isn't a "good" game, there's just not enough to qualify it as a game. A demo yes. The idea, and the art and the gametype would be fine - great even, if they were able to put a full amount of time into it. I understand financial constraints ect. They could perhaps just finish the game and release a real finished and polished game with the content and idea and have something. If so, invest in some writing, could be great. I personaly would have spent more time on it  whatever the cost or sacrifice. It was good enough start to make a game not necesarily on the level of Alice, but similar in charm, and it would have been worth it for the recognition and upvotes alone. Because with more work put in Woolfie would have a lot more been well recieved i think. Worth the gamble as a new dev.\nI mean at some point you have to just say it's done, i just wouldn't have let go of it yet.\n\nWorth 10 bucks, dunno, if you just want to pass some time. I'll say this, I've payed far more for games on Steam that never even ran, wouldn't even start up, or were so bug ridden or whatever. So that 20 - 30 dollars was straight wasted into thin air. Woolfie works, and plays very smoothly, has some chracter. This studio has some ability to make a game with some charm to it. If they keep it up.\n\nI can reccommend Woolfie if you just are into games as an art form, and like to see what people have created and not so much about the quality of gameplay and or quantity.\nFor this there should be a half thumb. I give it a thumb up to help them retain around a 55% rating, which is about where it stands.

You can beat this in about 2 hours. From the ending, it looks to be an episodic adventure. So provided it continues, this has the potential to be a really good game.\n\nStory wise, you play Red. Your mother is dead and your father killed. You go searching the nearby city for clues as to how your father died. Along the way you find out that there are girls disappearing from the school. As you venture out you fight storybook villains. The 2 storylines are decent and nothing special.\n\nAs for the graphics. I looks like a cross between American McGhee’s Alice and Giana Sisters. Granted, everything looks really good, it just looks like most of it was borrowed. Especially when you get to the forest. Sometimes the scenery will get in the way of your view or it will look like you can go a certain way only to end up dying for making a wrong step. In certain locations, the rats and traps look very identical to the ground. You may accidentally jump straight into one of them.\n\nThe music in the game is decent. There is nothing that will stand out making you want to stop and just listen. The dialog from the characters rhymes from dialog to dialog. That is probably one of the best features of the game. They do not say anything too important but they do manage to make what they say rhyme.\n\nThe controls are probably the worst part of this game. Combat is sluggish and not very effective. As you get introduced to new moves a banner pops up in the middle of the screen and will not go away until you press the corresponding buttons. However, the fight continues on in the background (in slow motion but still going). Secondly the jumping mechanics (actually the landing mechanics) need lots of work. If you drop from too high a ledge you take damage. If you jump off a ledge to land on a lower ledge you will take damage if you jump to high. With this happening quite often, it would appear that certain locations are not supposed to be traveled when in fact that is the direction you need to go.\n\nOne final bad thing. Although I do not expect a game to tell me everything, when fighting guys who one hit kill would be something I should know considering the enemies always seem to get in a hit. Fortunately there are infinite continues.\n\nWith all this being said, Woolfe is actually a good game with quite a bit on polish needed. Hopefully they will continue the story and rectify a lot of the issues.\n","June 12, 2015","true","2.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Graphics are remarkable, had me stop a couple of times and look at the stunning scenary. The game is relatively short, I finished it in about three hours but that was me checking for collectibles and such so you can probably beat it in less than three hours.\n\nAll in all, despite being a short game(its ten bucks so I suppose its that instance where you get what you pay for) and having somewhat lackluster gameplay, I enjoyed playing Woolfe.

And well, the story doesn't disappoint me. It is interesting and has a lot other fairy tale cameos, I also like the visuals and music in this game.\nBut the other mechanics... they are not nearly as good. The camera seems broken and every now and then starts twerking around. Controlling the character is pain in the butt sometimes, and don't let me even talk about how painful the combat system can be (even with controller). The game even made me feel motion sickness for the first time in my life. Like someone said, it almost feels like this is a demo - not the actual full version of the game.\n\nSo... I do recommend the game if twisted fairytales are your thing and you can stand more or less broken control system.

But mainly, to me it just looks so darn pretty. There may be some diverging opinions out there on this, but I think the level and character design is really good. This alone made it a worthy investment (when bought at a sale), despite being only half the game/story. Voice acting isn't too overly hammy/OTT (though I wouldn't call it stellar either) and the story is a somewhat interesting take on what I have always considered one of the lamer fairy tales.\n\nObviously not very long, but on the other hand it isn't unnecessarily padded either. Collectibles and achievements of varying levels of challenge for those who care to collect them, and none of them completely and utterly unreachable.\n\nI found it well worth my time and money, will play it again, was sorry to hear about the fate of the original developers and do hope the new owners of the IP will get around to making the other half.\n\nPick it up if you like this type of game in general, and enjoy the pretty if not the gameplay.","January 14","true","8.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The gameplay is reasonable, for most of the game. It's a hack-and-slash without sufficient explanation: Here are some controls and here are some combos, but they don't tell you when and why they work. So my fights resulted in some button-mashing racing to kill the enemies before they killed me. I never knew why the ground slam didn't work some of the time. The HUD is never explained either. I get that the bottle with red fluid seems to represent my health but what are the blue liquid-filled ones for? What do these glittery baskets mean, etc. And that lack of explanation extends throughout the game. Sometimes the path forward isn't what it seems, so I died plenty of times struggling to pull of a trick maneuver only to find out that there was no tricky maneuver required... I had simply gone the wrong way. Contradicting that are the collectible diaries which are usually found by going the wrong way and looking for secret paths. I found the game controls responsive for most of the game but they really became inconsistent in the last chase sequence where, for example, doing a roll under a log would result in red getting stuck and falling behind. This last chase sequence made me angry, thinking that this is where the game is broken and neglected. I also resented the fact that a diary collectible was only reachable at a dead end which meant certain death. So once again, the game rewards you for exploration but it also punishes you for exploration. None of the boss fights make any sense. They are just trial and error fight sequences with instant-death hazzards. The final boss fight forced me to reduce the game difficulty to easy because it just didn't seem fair on normal. This fight, one should think, would involve all the skills learned up to that point but no, it was just a much harder hack-and-slash fight without precious health recovery. So... another race to kill them before they kill you.\n\nThis game is beautiful and it sounds great but I get the impression that it was compromised to meet its release date. However, most of the journey was enjoyable and well worth it, so give it a try, you might like it.","May 15, 2015","true","6.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

A couple of the boss fights were annoying (they teleported the main character to where they wanted her to be after mini-cut-scenes instead of where I actually was before the scenes started.  Leading to a few cheap deaths).\n\nThe writing of the voice-over of the main character was by far the most annoying of all it's flaws.  She kept sliding in and out of rhyming verse (or just did stupid things like attempting to pass off 'hood' and 'food' as a rhyme - even though they had her pronounce both words normally).  I wish they would have just went one way or another with it because it was more than a little jarring.   When she didn't rhyme - which was quite often - I always found myself thinking of the verse they could have used and shaking my head.\n\nStill, for all it's flaws, I actually liked it and would play a sequel.\nI very much liked the character and stage design as well as the general atmosphere in the game and hope the sequel improves on the flaws I mentioned.  These flaws are what holds it back from being a real gem.\n\nLastly, while I did like it - I can't recommend paying full price ($10) for it, due to it's short length.","May 17, 2015","true","3.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

A Kickstarter/Indiegogo campaign could recover this game.\n\nThe bad bits for me were:\n- Voice-overs: above average, but would've liked to hear more emotion in the narrator's voice as I didn't quite feel like I was being captured by RRH with the relatively fixed and tense tone the narrator used. Lack of voice-overs for other characters within the first couple of hours of playing it didn't help. Granny was the first one outside of RRH to actually speak any words\n- Music: During tense/key moments the music just stays the same and doesn't really fit what's happening at the time so the story being told isn't coming across as it should\n- Combat: Expect to take hits as dodging is nearly impossible and there's no method of blocking (certainly not in the first couple of  hours of gameplay) and it doesn't appear to scale well on different difficulty settings.\n- Cutscenes: Some of the more dramatic cutscenes such as the introduction to the Pied Piper and the entrance of Woofle's carriage lacked any sort of tension and were not accompanied by the right music or camera effects to help instill that tension/drama\n- Dialogue: Minor point, but some of the text dialogue doesn't match up to what's being narrated at the time\n- Environment: Found it very difficult identifying whether or not some easter eggs (Woofle emblems) would be accessible at a later stage in the game or at that very point. If they were accessible at the point you find them, I found it impossible in a few cases to figure out how to reach them, especially as up to that point most Woofle emblems have either been in your direct path or otherwise intuitively hidden behind boxes or a relatively easy to identify path (although it might be challenging to walk it)\n\nThe good bits were:\n- Visually stunning; Easily ramped it up to high settings and embraced the beauty of it. They didn't spare much expense on the terrain and props and for the most part the characters themselves were excellent. Animations were good but needed a little polish.\n- Musical dialogue; if they invested a little more time in getting emotion across in the narration this would've been very captivating but I did like the musical/rhyming dialogue, it was a nice touch.\n- Gameplay variety; enough for me not to feel like I'm grinding away doing the same old thing. Environment interaction to learn about the story, elements of third person, side-scrolling and platformer gameplay, combat that includes special weapons and combo's and a light-weight tutorial that doesn't feel like it get's in the way of you playing the game.\n\nOverall, it showed promise, but I get the feeling that the money was funnelled predominantly into the visual effects when in actual fact they could've easily spared enough to get the weaker aspects up to scratch which would've make it a well rounded game.\n\nFor now, if you see it cheap, get it; as it's worth a few hours of your time.","October 21, 2015","true","2.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The visual style and setting had a strong appeal to me. It reminded me of another game I love playing on my 360, Alice: Madness Returns, and also at least visually Fable II.\n\nI haven't completed the game yet, but I'm close, and I'm loving it.\n\nIt is however not without it's issues.\nThe first is the short story. I'm ~5hrs in, and I'm more than 2/3rds through. Others I'm sure could be done by now as I'm not a fast gamer.\nSecond, and by far the most annoying during gameplay, is it's very hard to judge where you are about to land when you take your jumps. Some other games do this by having a marker appear below the character to show where they will land, and this game could very much benefit from this.\nBut the worst of all is the fact that the studio that made this went bankrupt. Which means no improvements, and no new chapters. That is by far the worst part of this game, the potential you can see, and knowing there's no one left to move it forward. While I am happy that Rebellion picked it up during bankruptcy, and provided the goods to the Kickstarter backers, I would much rather of had this game by picked up by a studio interested in finishing it, or at least putting the IP to use, rather than just letting it sit as is.It truly is a shame that this game will never get properly finished, polished, and expanded on.","February 8","true","4.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/marauderdz/recommended/281940/","marauderdz","stanley.lui","http://steamcommunity.com/id/marauderdz/","223 products in account","TL;DR version: Buy it at 75% off to encourage the new devs.\n\nI really have a love/hate relationship with this game. On the one hand, I love the setup, the character design, and the quirkly portrayal of Red herself.  The game itself... not so much. As others have said, it's like they tried to throw too much into it, and ended up with a bit of a mess.  I didn't have the game killing glitches others have reported, and it's important to note that they may have been patched, but there were a few incredibly annoying issues.  Two stand out:\n\n1. Leaping from pipe to pipe (branch, vine, etc)  is a crapshoot.  I'm seriously unclear over how the game determines you want to grab a pipe or leap/drop past it, but it figured wrong A LOT.  Or maybe my timing had to be perfect, I don't know.\n\n2. Racing. Holy hell in a handbasket, that horse carriage race is unforgiving.  Any mistake at all, and you're screwed, because the camera follows the carriage you're chasing, rather than you, so if you fall slightly behind, you suddenly can't see where you're going.  Not only that, but the camera angle often makes it difficult to see *why* you failed.\n\nRelatively minor issues include:\n\nKeyboard mapping is terrible. Seriously, in this day and age, not using WASD is just being stubborn. And the attack keys seem poorly thought out.  If you couldn't remap, I'd even consider this a major issue.\n\nLimited attack vectors. Basically, if the enemy isn't in one of the 8 major cardinal directions from you, you miss.\n\nUnclear instructions on using magic.  I still can't figure out how to charge up my area attack.\n\nRandom rules. Well, not random exactly, but at points, the game will forcibly place Red in a specific spot, even if you're halfway across the screen, and place invisible barriers in place because it wants you to fight the boss battle or solve the puzzle in one specific way.  In one spot, if you merely use an alternate path to a floating island, the game even breaks.\n\nA LOT of platforming, some of it pretty advanced.  My biggest gripe about platforming puzzles in general?  They're not affected by the difficulty level you select, and any mistake results in death.  Fortunately, I had some warning after seeing a speed run, but wow.  Oh, and the aforementioned camera angles make some of the jumps really tough to judge (in some cases, you even have to jump blindly).\n\nCheckpoints. While the death checkpoints are spaced pretty fairly, the game exit checkpoints can be pretty far apart.  You quit the game to do something else, and when you come back, you find you have to replay from the start of the chapter.  Grrr.\n\n\nHonestly, if I hadn't found a trainer for this game, I doubt I'd have been able to finish it.\n\n\nLooking back on this review, it looks like I hated the game.  Indeed, one portion had me so frustrated, I uninstalled it.  So why am I not warning everyone away?  Because I can still see the potential in this game.  Red herself is great; she's normally so serious that the occasional Whedoneque joke caught me off guard and made me laugh.   The universe is appealing, and I can see a lot of potential there.  The story isn't as clever as the devs probably thought, but as a seed, it's good.  Woolfe himself was a rather dull villain, but the cliffhanger leaves room to fix that.  I want people to buy this game (on sale, because lord knows it's not worth full price) to encourage Rebellion, its new owners, to make a superior second chapter.","January 4","true","11.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/idiobrando/recommended/281940/","idiobrando","I DIO!","http://steamcommunity.com/id/idiobrando/","517 products in account","I backed this game for $10 during the Kickstarter campaign. One major motivation was that it looked like American McGee's Alice's kid sister and I'd say that what it sort of is. I also played some of the alpha and beta and have to give Grin credit for being pretty diligent with updating, the finished game has came along way from the alpha demo. When it comes to the final game the atmosphere is fantastic and the writing is decent though it seems inconsistent, namely with Red’s parents and their relationship. Red’s VA does a good job of giving her some life so she’s a fun enough protagonist. The platforming is quite solid without being really difficult, but the combat's rather clunky and anemic. Two major reasons are that there's no real combo system and weapon variety, only just the axe, and that you only learn new abilities for the axe at certain points of the game. You can't use them beforehand so it really limits your combat options and due to the game's short length you really don't get a good feel of it at all.  A good amount of the time you’re not really forced to fight though as Red is really mobile and can easily outrun or sneak past most enemies. The bosses also have one-hit kill attacks, they are easy enough to avoid once you figure it out but it still feels unnecessary. The game feels like it ends too soon but for the $10 asking price I think it’s reasonable and I had my fun with it.  There’s one gamebreaking bug I ran into though so there’s some patching to be done so I’d wait a week or two until they’re fixed.\n\nThere’s supposed to be a followup in August which makes me think a big mistake that the devs made was not just keeping this game in the oven longer, add all the stuff from the second part, and release it for $20 because it would be around five hours if the second part is as long as this game, and it would be more appealing to people that way. Overall though it’s a solid game worth playing despite its flaws.","March 18, 2015","true","2.7"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/smokedcarpenter/recommended/281940/","smokedcarpenter","SmokedCarpenter","http://steamcommunity.com/id/smokedcarpenter/","242 products in account","I bought this for somewhere around $4 on sale a few days ago. I saw the mixed reviews, but decided to take a risk anyway. I was not disappointed. Woolfe is an EXCELLENT game. It is not without flaws, but overall it was a genuinely fun and unqiue platformer.\n\nPros:\nExcellent graphics, especially when you consider that it is an "indie" game. The artwork was very immersive and beautiful, the world that you travel through is a beautiful but terrible place and completely draws you into the story.\n\nThe plot was very good. The important thing was that it was completely unique and inventive. Turning a classic fairy tale into a steampunk "Coming-of-Age" tragedy is simply inspired.\n\nThe writing was very ambitious. They attempted to narrate the story through the mouth of Red Riding Hood, who speaks almost exclusively in rhymes. Although it sometimes feels forced, and sometimes they simply can't make the rhymes work, it is overall very charming. Aside from the rhyming attempts, the actual writing of the dialogue is just excellent. The player is immediately pulled in by Red's narration, and her intermittent dialogue really does paint a picture of her character and the world around her.\n\nThe voice acting was superb! I cannot express enough how well done Red's voice acting was. Even on the clunkier rhymes she manages to make it work. I really believe whoever voiced Red was the perfect match to her character.\n\nThe lore was just AMAZING. As you progress you will find various secrets hidden in the levels, which unlock pieces of background lore, concept art, or fun facts about the game. I read ALL of them, and was just in love with the universe this development team has created around a classic fairytale. I highly recommend you discover all the secretsm it is well worth your time. I only wish there was more of it.Cons\nThe platforming was for the most part ridiculously easy, which isn't necessarily the worst thing for a story-driven game, because you don't want players to spend so much time and energy beating a zone that they lose focus on the plot. Still, it was far too easy.\n\nThe combat was both easy and unfair at the same time. It is also fairly simplistic, you can fast attack, strong attack, jump, roll, and perform 4 "special" moves that you unlock as you progress. Special moves consume magic power which you pick up from defeating enemies. When you have full magic the combat is laughable, but when you're out of magic it becomes very difficult to fight multiple enemies. You could also just run past 90% of the game's enemies if you wanted to.\n\nBy making the game so-called "2.5D" it becomes very unclear which parts of the world are actually accessible, and which parts are simply in the background. This creates a lot of "leap of faith" and trial and error situations, when you're unsure if the platform you're jumping to is actually part of the game or not. That being said, I love the 2.5D design, I just wish the boundaries were more clearly marked.\n\nThe game is VERY short. I beat it in 2 hours, and got 100% of achievements after 1 more hour of hunting. For a $10 game on steam, that isn't very good value, but when on sale the value is excellent.\nTL;DR: If you're looking for a unqiue and gripping story-driven game to immerse yourself in for a few hours, you will love this game. If you're looking for a hardcore, challenging platformer or in-depth combat, this isn't the game for you.\n\n7/10\n\nNote: The game sets up for a sequel, but from what I've read that sequel doesn't seem to be coming, unfortunately. I believe the company that created the game no longer exists, and no sequel is being developed. However, the ending isn't so much of a cliffhanger that it NEEDS a sequel, everything was wrapped up very nicely in the end.","January 17","true","3.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But nothing is more fitting for Woofle - The Red Hood Diaries then just that.\n\nBut there's a lot to like here... and hate. The setting is moody, some of the writing, particularly during the narration segments is well done, as is the voice actor playing Red Riding Hood. Visually the game looks nice for an indie title, the platforming controls are  responsive.\n\nBut the writing during the gameplay seems out of place. Red Riding Hood is set up as this girl who's been through some things, has seem some stuff, and because of that she's become this almost brooding girl out for revenge. But she has these quips she makes during the gameplay, that have a completely different tone then what the game goes for during the narration bits... instead of this dark character, she becomes like a snarky teenager, it's odd.\n\nAll the bosses are terrible, and not fun. I would go into detail, but then this review would be far too long. The early platforming is well done, the later platforming sections are pretty bad. During the 2nd half it's just too dificult to tell where you're suppose to go. The combat needs a lot of work, it's just not satisfying to the point that I'd rather GRIN make the next episode entirely platforming.\n\nVerdict: Did I regret playing Woolfe - The Red Hood Diaries? No, but I also didn't pay the full $9.99 asking price. I'm looking forward to the 2nd half of this tale, because there's  potential... but only buy this episode if it's $4.99 or less.","July 13, 2015","true","7.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Unfortunately, once past the trailers an opening segment, the player isn't given much in the way of an experience. Though, the environments are generally attractive, close inspection uncovers disconnected placement of objects (lamp posts not actually touching the ground, breakable boxes looking identical to indestructible ones, etc) as well as a lack of interactivity that makes the "world" feel flat.\n\nAs far as story, there is little inspiration. Red starts out a vendetta against B. B. Woolfe for her father's death with little more than suspicion of the entrepreneur's involvement. Although Woolfe's guilt is blatantly oblivious to the player, Red initially has no clear reason to back her desire to kill him. She does find evidence (from a predictable twist about her father's career), and a potential conspirator, but she kills him before making any attempt at interrogation. From there it is rinse and repeat. Find a little evidence of guilt, expose some more predictable plot points, and kill someone in your way without sufficient cause.\n\nAdding to the lack of personality in the game is that no one speaks outside of Red, and Granny. Bosses don't even get dialogue to introduce themselves, antagonize Red, or even grunt in battle. From a story telling standpoint this is a major shortcoming, as the player has no investment their supposed enemy, thus there is little motivation to fight, let alone care about or even remember the experience. Interestingly enough, Red has the opposite problem. Simply put, she speaks too much. Making pointless quips every five steps, her voice is soon tuned out, or worse yet becomes a disruptive frustration, considering she is meant to be sneaking for an extended period. The girl also speaks in lack-luster, half rhymes. The concept itself could have been rather whimsical, but it feels forced due to poor word play, and how the gimmick was often abandoned for several lines.\n\nMoving on to game play, the terms lacking and frustrating once again come to mind. While the camera is set in a relatively fixed position, Red can traverse levels in full 3d motion. Often when platforming the fixed perspective makes judging jumps difficult. Red also, lacks a permanent shadow to provide feedback regarding her position relative to platforms. This makes it aggravatingly easy to over/under shoot platforms on the z-plane (toward or away from the screen).\n\nIn addition to platforming, there are basic puzzle mechanics and combat. The former is presented as expected in any game of the genre, and deserves no real comment. Fights on the other hand are like jumping, as in easily misjudged, leading to repeated death. Enemies have little reaction to taking damage so it is difficult to fend off multiple targets. Special abilities provide some help with crowd control but it is  easy to become stun-locked when trying to use them.\nA point should be made that combat seems to be discouraged initially. Based on Red being portrayed as "sneaking" through the city, and enemy deaths prompting a certain comment box ( indicating that killing them may be a negative karma event), one might gravitate toward avoiding combat. At a certain point however, progress can only be made by killing opponents in front of a door. This dynamic was never used until that point and not even hinted at, leaving the player to wonder if they had missed a switch.\n\nFinally, and most importantly, total game play takes less than two hours even when collecting all secrets. The reason for this is that Woolfe appears to be released as episodes, and ten dollars gets you chapter one. This is possibly the most frustrating aspect, as there is no clear indication on the store page that the software is only a partial game, amounting to little more than a demo or tutorial level. Combining this with poor gameplay, forgettable characters, and the very important (and not publicized) fact that the devolper is out of business makes the experience a complete disappointment.","October 24, 2015","false","2.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

For all others I think 10€ are a fair price. Also consider that sales now ensure the quality of episode 2.\n\nI really wanted to like the game - I was a backer since Gamescom. And I mostly liked it.\nThe art design is very beautiful, the sounds (which have come a long way since the Gamescom demo) are good, the collectibles/backstory thingies are nice, the setting is cool, Red Hood's remarks are often witty, and so on.\nI didn't have any crashes. Followers of the campaign on Kickstarter, Facebook and/or Twitter will see the game and understand how much effort this small independent team from Belgium put into this game and how that mostly paid off.\n\nBut: Don't get me wrong, I'm fine with a hard game. But the checkpoints are often ridicolously far away from each other. When dying close to the end of a section means having to re-do the whole long section the frustration potential is plainly high. Also, checkpoints do not really save the game, if you quit it and restart later you often end up a while before your last "basket" (checkpoint). Not cool.\nAlso, standard controls on keyboard sometimes seem fiddly and non-optimal.\n\nYes, I would still recommend the game.

The story takes a steam punk twist to the classic Red Riding hood fairy tale. The music and voice acting were done very well, and did a great job of propelling the atmosphere and setting the tone. The environment is well done, and the theme and atmosphere are done perfectly to push the story and embody the tale.\n\nThe level design fits mostly with the platforming element. There are a few times when you can't tell if you can or cannot jump over particular railings or boxes. It can be pesky when you come to a boss fight, and due to the camera angle and platforming mechanics you think that you are jumping to safety when in reality you can't jump over said obstacle, or jump into an invisible wall. Overall the character has fluidity and slides along ledges with adequate speed and without looking or feeling clunky. As you progress through the game, the design of the traps that you get through become more demanding and precise in their requirements, and the margin for error becomes greater and greater. Overall I felt that the precision needed to get through the traps became too difficult for the speed with which you had to progress through them. Are they doable yes, but it is just tasking.\n\nThe combat is just bad. Yes, the weapon has weight, and there is a fluidity to the fighting, but there is a strong hack and slash feeling to the battles. You are reduced to repetitively pushing the same two buttons, and while it looks impressive, you don't gain any sense of power or control, and your character is so squishy that you are tempted more times than not just to run by the enemies, in avoidance of death. One of the more frustrating aspects of the combat is that you may be able to tell that an enemy is going to hit you, and you try to dodge or counter it, but your character is locked into whatever combo move and won't react until they are finished with it. Which means you die more. The game offers a stealth element, but it felt like it may have been tacked on last minute, as there are very few opportunities to use it, and it just didn't fit into the game very well.\n\nThe story started out very promising. I was literally on the edge of my seat for the intro, with a grin on my face. As it progresses forward, it seems to make less and less sense. The mechanics and combat in the game take away from the tension the story creates. To make it worse, this 2-3 hour long game ends with a 'to be continued'!  Just when you think your questions will be answered, more questions and secrets are dumped on you, with none resolved before they leave you hanging.\n\nThe sum of this games misgivings and flaws far outweigh any enjoyment I found in this game. I cannot and will not recommend this game, even if it is on sale on steam.\n\nThanks for your viewership and support; for more videos click here.\nhttp://www.youtube.com/c/SocioPsycho","December 6, 2015","false","3.2"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Which puts on the more morbid tone of the game which where she continues to go on and tell you about the suspicious death of her father, who she believes the culprit is the Big bad wolf of the story; B.B.Wolfe.\nNow that her mother has gone missing to Red takes it upon herself to go to the ghost city of Ulrica and sniff out the truth. The game gives you about an hour and a half of gameplay, which includes Red running through the city of Ulrica swinging her axe fighting off groups of mechanical toy-like soldiers. While running back and forth through the level solving simplistic problems.\nThere are 3 sections in the game where you are forced to walk around the scenery and relive the memories/ backstory of this twisted tale, which is a good addition to the game. Without these levels there is little lore to go around, there are little emblems that are scattered through out the few levels of this game, each one showing a little bit of backstory or art. As the game progresses i would rather have seen a leveling up method where you can choose the abilities that your axe wielding character possesses rather than just be given almost useless ones, leaving me to be just spamming the ‘Light attack’ which more than likely won't hit the target that you are aiming for.\n\nThere are good qualities about this game with in the sea of head pounding flaws, while playing through the game you do come across some undoubtedly beautiful scenery, from the slums of Ulrica to the (what seems to be) radiation polluted forest with little islands of land floating in the air. Another interesting feature within the game is, when you kill a soldier a little box comes up with the deceased name. Now i'm not to sure about this aspect, it feels like the developer spent time adding things into the game that didn't necessarily need to be in it, which time spent could have been used to refine the actual game play.\n\nEven with all the slander in this review i still think that this game is worth playing even with numerous flaws.\n","March 20, 2015","true","1.9"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

Even a tad murderous.\nThis game though was not worth the ten dollars I paid, if it had been five or less I would not be complaining.\n\nHere is why I feel it is not worth ten dollars, or the headache it gave me.\n\nYour mouse is useless and the camera goes wherever it wants to. There was a point where you have to ascend up a sort of spiraling contraption and until you get it you have to go back to the point a ways back. It took me 10 tries and I had to take a break at 8 because I was physically getting dizzy and nauseous due to frustration and the bright lights combined with the spinning.\n\nThe story was good for a short story (like i said worth FIVE DOLLARS OR LESS) the art work was kinda pretty. The voice acting could have been worse and i thought it cute how often she rhymed. Albeit short, and now i know the chance of the next part is not likely - i am very disappointed.\n\nNow here's the best part. The platforming and jumping some parts were ridiculous. I would have to retry a jump 7 times and doing it the same every single time - i finally get it because the game takes pity on me. Hearing her cry 'NOOOOOOO' super loud every time was irritating too - contributing to the headache. Sometimes it was even hard to tell where I needed to go due to the camera.\n\nOver all...\nStory: 8/10\nGraphics: 7.5/10\nMovement: 2/10\nFrustration levels: 20/10\n\nSo in total, if you're bored and not short tempered - go ahead and try it but i dont recommend buying it at full price. I honestly would like to see it continue but maybe tweak the movement and maybe make her yelling a little less loud... Now I shall go put ice to my forehead because playing that for an hour straight makes my head hurt.","September 22, 2015","false","2.9"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

The idea is interesting, the game has some good art concept. But, unfortunately, it is compromised by too many things. Gameplay is awkward at best, the impact physics is either bad implemented or simply isn't there, the story is rushed, camera positioning is not the best, most of the characters in the world are mute and the game itself is pretty short, even by indie standards, and, not only that, the developer simply finishes the game on a cliffhanger, supposing there will be a "continuation". But the game was not sold as an "episodic" game, so it it pretty much unsatisfying if you don't reach a conclusion in the game and are left hoping there will be a continuation by the developer.

The game for me also has some parallels to American McGee’s Alice due to the two protagonists in the story who are not afraid to get their hands dirty and also share some similar gameplay parallels.\n\nSo its core, Woolfe – The Red Hood Diaries allows the gamer to control the protagonist Red who is investigating her father’s death at Mr. Woolfe’s factory and also wants revenge. Red was also raised by her grandmother who taught her a few things about fighting and magic. So with your axe by side, magic in the other, Red commences her journey through this dark and twisted world looking for clues, answers and blood.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, Woolfe – The Red Hood Diaries is basically a 3D arcade game with a strong emphasis on 2D platforming mechanics which looks glorious on a PC with full detail. The world of Woolfe is rich, diverse and even though it is quite dark can be very colourful at certain times. Apart from killing enemies and fighting bosses, Red must also use stealth to sneak around the environment.\n\nTo complement the engaging story about Red, there’s some great voice acting that goes hand in hand with the gameplay and the fantasy inspired musical score. However there are a couple of bugs here and there in the gaming world but developers GriN Multimedia are thankfully addressing these issues which is more so with the timing mechanics. Another issue was jumping between different platforming levels that at times had me dying quite a number of times.\n\nAlthough the game supports a keyboard/mouse combination, to play the game as it should be played is via a PC controller which transforms the game into a FULL HD arcade console experience. As you defeat enemies, solve puzzles and explore the world, all the clues are right in front of the player but at times, the puzzles which require timing can be quite a challenge. Overall, the experience is just over 2 1/2 hours but there’s plenty of arcade enjoyment to be found in Woolfe – The Red Hood Diaries.\n\nFinal Thoughts?\n\nAlthough this is only part one of Woolfe – The Red Hood Diaries, developers GriN Multimedia should be commended on creating a rather engaging arcade experience on the PC that harkens back to American McGee’s Alice with its twisted storytelling and gameplay.\n\nThe game looks beautiful on a PC with some exceptional detail and sturdy gameplay mechanics that for the most part work well. Reiterating again, the game needs to be played with a controller because it does make the experience considerably easier and even though there are a few flaws, it’s definitely a game for those wanting a fun arcade fix.\n\nMinimum System Requirements:\n\nOS: Windows 7\nProcessor: Intel i5 2x 2.6 GHz, or AMD equivalent\nMemory: 3 GB RAM\nGraphics: Nvidia GT 640, AMD Radeon HD 6870/7750\nDirectX: Version 9.0\nHard Drive: 3 GB available space\nAdditional Notes: Don’t use the highest settings on a lower-end machine\n\nGameplay 3.5/5\nGraphiccs 3.5/5\nAudio        4/5\nValue          3.5/5\nSummary: Woolfe The Red Hood Diaries is a twisted gothic fairy tale that at times is held back by its mediocre gaming mechanics\n\n3.5/5 Interesting\n\nTHE GOOD\nBeautiful art direction\n\nTHE BAD\nFrequent, aggravating bugs\nRed's poetry is terrible\nUninspired gameplay\nBad collision detection","January 16","false","1.6"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","7","15","0","0"

In concept, the idea of Little Red Riding Hood starring in this dark world is an interesting concept, to an extent. If you’ve ever heard the fairy tale of Little Red, then you can probably hazard to guess that the game is going to be a revenge story. After all, I couldn’t really imagine Little Red wanting anything more than to get revenge for the wolf killing her grandmother.\n\nWoolfe though takes a slightly different twist, by killing off her parents first, instead of her grandmother. So in a hunt for revenge, Red has spent the past couple of weeks in the city of Ulrica, a city filled with robot tin-men and rats to find out who was responsible for her father’s disappearance and to take down B. B. Woolfe.\n\nI’m going to be honest, both the story and the city were pretty boring. It’s your classic revenge story, but in a cool, dark fairy tale setting, which is a setting I’m a fan of, but the story didn’t particularly grab me while I was playing. And to make matters worse, the city you play at least one half of the game in just feels kind of boring and uninspired. The tin-men enemies are pretty cool, especially when you kill one, because it pops up with a number, and then a name next to that. What that relates to is one of the many Kickstarter backers that backed this game, and seeing one of a possible 500 names when you kill an enemy is a pretty cool feature and one that the game has going for it. The disappointing thing about this though, is that you’re only in the city for about an hour, before you move on. Once you’re out of the city, the tin-men are gone and that cool Kickstarter feature is just gone for the rest of the game, so the one of the few good things the game has going for it, and it lasts no more than an hour at best.\n\nBefore I hit upon the rest of the negatives, allow me to touch on something positive: The second level; the forest. The awesome, floating world of the forest is where it really started to pick up for me, at least in terms of settings. The city of Ulrica felt plain and uninspired, but the floating, ruined forest really did take the cake, as it really did look like the kind of thing you would expect in a dark fairy tale, and it was one of the very few positives that I took from playing this game.\n\nNow, sadly I must start on what I didn’t like about the game. Firstly, the combat! The combat sucked, simply put. Your attacks ranged from spamming light attack, for the same exact combo every single time, or you could try a heavy attack, and that was it. You couldn’t even link the two together, which even the most basic character-action games have the ability to mix heavy attacks with light ones, but alas no, this game did not. To make matters worse when it came to the combat, whenever you struck someone with your axe, a weapon that should normally have some significant weight behind it, felt light, dainty, and just plain bad. The combat felt so plain and boring from the get go, that I tried to avoid combat altogether throughout almost the entire game, as the games strong suit was not in that aspect.\n\nTo carry on what I was saying earlier, the game also toted some four abilities for Red to use. The first was an AOE smash on the ground; the second was an axe throw that hit your opponent on the way there, and the way back. The third was a jumping AOE spin, and the fourth was some weird single hit claw attack. The first three abilities have their uses throughout the game and you can see that, but the fourth I could not, and allow me to tell you why. The fourth ability you don’t get until halfway through the FINAL BOSS fight. That is not enough time to figure out what it does; how much damage it does, and if it is useful. I tried using it on the final boss a couple of times, before having him destroy me fairly quickly, at which point I returned to throwing my bloody axe at him, as that actually did something.\n\nNow to end things, the game ends on a cliff-hanger after a measly two hours of gameplay. The game is incredibly short, and is obviously the precursor to something bigger, but those two hours were enough for me I’m afraid. I was sat, watching the final cutscene, thinking “is this the end, or am I not done?” At which point granny answered my question by saying, “you must return to Ulrica, and save the city from its chaos.” I can’t recall if I groaned or not at the thought of the game not being finished, but alas, the gods shined on me this day, as the game was over and it started to roll the credits.\n\nI’m going to be honest and say that the game needs a lot of work if it wants its sequel to succeed, because at the moment, if it turns out anything like this game, I won’t be touching it, that’s for sure. The uninspired combat, the short story, and the incredibly dull first half of the game; I’m sorry, but a city with robots and snow is not what I’d call interesting.\n\nOverall, I can’t recommend the game at all. It tried to do some things right, but ended up falling flat unfortunately. I would have loved a cool, dark story about Little Red Riding Hood, but this game is not that. If you want to pick it up, wait for a sale and have your expectations low, as the game isn’t particularly special in any aspect at all.","May 22, 2015","false","2.2"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

I had to tweak 2 different files to finally get this game to run and even still it stuttered a lot.\n\nGetting into gameplay there were a few things that were just irksome.\n\nOne, no camera control.  I honestly felt like I was playing Castlevania LoS again... and that wasn't a fun experience, the auto-panning of the camera made me misjudge several jumps, ones that counted.\n\nTwo, absolutely dreadful platforming.  Ok I get it, this was a lower budget piece, but instead of putting the extra bit of shine on the cutscene's or spending quite as much on the music and title screen it might have been better to invest a bit more into the programming of the platforming.  The sewer section was god awful, I actually got the 'fail death' achievement that some developers throw in for a good laugh.  I didn't find it funny.  In fact is really made me quite angry.  There was a very precise timed jump that had to be done and I would fail mid way or get through it and not be able to move down to the lower ledge, it was infuriating, I think I actually glitched across it by smashing my keyboard, though that did nothing about the breakable platform that gave no warning before falling from below me.\n\nI'm sorry, it looked pretty, but I just can't recommend this game unless you want to torture yourself.\n\nNow then I'm off to have a strong drink because after trying to play this game I need it.","September 18, 2015","false","0.9"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

If you pick up this game, expect floaty controls, hit boxes that are larger than they should be (and will cause you to die), deaths because you fall through the scenery, dodgy "boss" battles where every death you suffer feels like unjust punishment, trail-and-error gameplay, and so on and so forth. It's not worth the hassle. I don't understand why Rebellion felt the need to purchase the IP (perhaps they're hoping to seel the movie rights for a gritty fairy tale film the likes of which were popular in Hollywood recently?), but the game is not worth the effort.\n\nAfter my umpteenth undeserved death during the final boss battle (which I reached within two hours), I'm calling this a day. Maybe I'll try again at some point in the future, but there are too many good games in my collection to waste anymore time on this so-so experience just to see the nice graphics. For something that looks just as good (complete with a fairy tale motif), but actually plays well, check out the Trine games instead.

The story's concept is dark and i liked that. I don't believe in Gameplay's length as a critical point cause i think games should be judged by how they are not how we wish they were, Anyway if just gameplay time defines good and bad game for you i must say that "Woolfe - The Red Hood Diaries" is a short game. Gameplay and its issues are what make me give negative to this game. Combat is very simple and without depth, there's no significant strategy or tactic during combat and you can kill enemies with button mashing. I can't detect hit animations properly and enemies warm up attacks as well, this gets worse during boss fights which you should must die several times in case of memorizing each moment of battle for later tries. 2.5 platforming sounds interesting but camera angles caused a lot of trouble and cheap deaths for me, every platforming challenge or attempts to reach secrets which are backstory and concept arts was kind of trial and error for me. Since Red Hood can't swim, devs disappoint us with colliding water! Come on, why taking the joy of standing in water from her?! Oh Invisible Walls! They do exist in the worst shape ever, avoiding the player to make shortcuts by jumping over most small and low obstacles. mechanics distribution through gameplay is not interesting for me too, specially during final boss. You know i want to be mastered on all character's skill before final boss so introducing new mechanic middle of the boss fight some kinda makes me feel stupid that i must still learn! and at last i must mention the bugs and glitches in all types.","March 22, 2015","false","3.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/anomalousunderdog/recommended/281940/","anomalousunderdog","StickyWhiteStuff","http://steamcommunity.com/id/anomalousunderdog/","396 products in account","+ Amazingly good graphics.\n\n- Lots of platforming, but poor execution. If you fall on water or get hit by spikes, it's instant death, and respawning is a short fade to black, then fade in with you back at the nearest respawn point. The whole respawn animation effect makes it a little too tedious when you do trial and error. Some respawn points put you too far back when you die, so for example, you'd have to wait for a moving platform to get closer to you again and jump on it, before you can proceed.\n\n- The camera and perspective work against you for the platforming parts. The game has a sort of side-scrolling level layout, but you can move in 3d. So when you move deeper in, it's sometimes not easily evident since the camera is in side view. Running around the level often ends up with me bumping on posts and obstacles, which gets me stuck, which, at first glance doesn't look like it, but if you rotate the camera, you'd see that yes, you were trying to walk through a pillar. I would think that bringing the camera a little higher while maintaining its gaze down at the level could help, but I'm just guessing here. It's also sometimes hard to gauge where I'll land upon jumping.\n\n- Generally clunky combat animations. Don't expect a deep combat system here. Even while you're constantly hitting an enemy, they're still able to do attacks while in the middle of getting hurt. So the idea here is to roll away when they're doing an attack. But with all the special effects your weapon does, its sometimes hard to notice when someone's about to hit you.\n\n\n\nI'd really rather not give this game a thumbs down because it looks so gorgeous, you could tell the developers poured a lot into making the graphics look beautiful. But as a game, it's generally a frustrating experience, but your mileage may vary.","June 24, 2015","false","0.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ceresbane/recommended/281940/","ceresbane","CeresBane","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ceresbane/","323 products in account","After playing this game (on easy no less), I encountered unintuitive gameplay, glitches that blocked progress, screwed up hit boxes, even glitches that made the game too easy. Its a game that doesn't know what the hell it wants. Is it a platformer? A spectacle fighter? A stealth game? Special attacks are redundant as it suffers from the dominant strategy syndrome. Grand slam and Heavy attack is all you need throughout the game. Why? Because every fight is merely a dps race. Enemies do not stagger, combos are slower than just spamming heavy attack and the other 3 special moves do nothing to the gameplay. There's a sneaking button, thats never used besides two instances, other times you are reccomended to sneak, but you can just blast right through if you are quick enough. On a chapter called heading home, you race against a carriage. The game will not tell you about a redundant sprint button that exists, nor will you ever use it besides this one instance. On boss fights there is little to no clue as to indicate methods of beating a boss. Plus for a game with a focus (tho not primary) on combat in its control scheme, you have little to no health in many fights as there are many instant deaths for no reason besides extending the life span of fights. There is little tactics besides hitting and running away (so badass).\n\nThe creators don't understand that a game mechanic is something that should be universally integrated into the core gameplay. Metroidvanias have special moves to progress through otherwise missed areas, beat'em ups have special attacks fit for every circumstance in combat (like crowd control and high dps and stunlocking) and LEVEL DESIGN SHOULD REFLECT THE PHILOSOPHY BY CATERING TO THEM BY CREATING CONSISTENT CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE THEY ARE UTILISED.\n\nIn this game, it is not the case.\n\nThe major bugs I found? A certain jump in forest adrift where you must fall into two platforms using the double jump to dodge instant death thorns. The first jump works fine. But the second jump has the platform have thorns slightly above the platform you need to land and thorns above, so you have this tiny gap. But someone screwed up the hit boxes and set the instant kill hit box for the one below too high. So you die even though you are VISIBLY above the lower thorns. It is one of those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t pixel perfect jumps. You will know it once you see it. Right after that is a drop to a lower platform. Natural instinct is to walk to the foreground and jump down to it. You just died. The lower platform is exactly in the same axis as the platform above. You must fall and then press up to fall into the background again.\n\nA really big one is the final boss fight. Sometimes the boss bugs out and doesn't move after doing its lightning attack. Or it gets into a loop where its doing its chasing and slashing and stabbing routine. In this weird state, it is entirely invicible. You can spam light attack to see for yourself. In this state the enemy takes no damage of any kind even though previously it is vulerable just after it does its attack.\n\nThere are many other bugs like mispelt subtitles, skewed Z perspective, very immersion killing invisible walls, unclear safe platforms and what are just set pieces, suspiciously sized hit boxes, screen tearing and framerate inconsistencies etc.\n\nAs for the story? I pose these questions as you play this?\nHow did woolfe know about the girl?\nHow did woolfe know about the location granma's house when Mr. Hog of the 3 pigs pub is said to be the only one that knows the location?\nHow did the Pied Piper manage to kidnap so many girls when the whole city knew there was a girl snatching kidnapper about?\nHow did anyone get anywhere when all these platforming puzzles are about?\nWhy did woolfe even want granma dead?\nHow the hell did Woolfe get wolf summoning powers and lightning magic?\n\nSo many "this is a thing now" moments.

I was one of the people that helped get this game greenlighted on Steam; and I am thoroughly dissapointed.  Remember the Pinnochio Boss battle in the trailer for this game? Gone!! not a single trace of it! completely ripped out of the game!!  I was absolutely looking forward to this game so much, I couldn't wait to buy it and play through it in several sittings... I beat this game in one sitting.\n\nBut not all is bad with this game, and here's the list of the things that hold this game up:\n\n+BEAUTIFUL environments!  Absolutely gorgeous!! I love every bit of scenery!\n+excellent combat system with very tricky magic feature.  It feels unique and kind of fresh.\n+The boss fights! The boss fights are great!! especially the Woolfe boss fight!  I feel so refreshed that there is a game that offers hard boss fights without throwing everysingle enemy in your face or a pointless QTE session.\n+Excellent writing, at the beginning I was rolling my eyes, but after the first twenty minutes I was enthralled and just so happy to listen to red Riding hood explain everything in a unique rhyming way, it feels so beloved.\n+Hard mode is no joke! I love a game that offers challenge, and this game offered plenty of it.\n+American Mcgee touch of dark magic without American Mcgee behind it at all, I genuinely felt like playing the sister game of Alice Madness Returns.\n\nI love this game with all my heart because it shows that the small team of developers cared so much about what they were doing, this game reeks of effort.  The developers should be commended and patted on the back and be told that they are definitely heading in the right direction with their efforts... But I cannot give this game a thumbs up... because I feel like there is so much missing from the game!  There is so much promise here, so much potential, but the game feels like it was cut in half.  the Story is unended Red Riding Hood has gained a very supernatural power through her grandmother, and that's it.\n\nI do think this game is worth more than $10.00 due to it's amazing visuals and wonderful writing and a glorious gameplay system.  And I do think you should buy it at its' current state!  The developers should be supported to the best of our capabilities by buying this game and playing through it and letting them know how much we love it.  But we should let them know that we want the FULL game!  We don't want half of it, we want the whole cake!  Don't just cut a tiny slice out and serve it to us, because you are actually hurting yourselves by depriving the upmost beautiful piece of artwork from the public.  I understand that the developers had a tight tight budget, and they can't be blamed for this game being cut in half.\n\nNow a love letter to Grin studios from Me:  I will buy your sequel because I liked the first game, but if you are planning to make a DLC for this game, I'll buy it as well!

It appears that the only way to /play this game is by using a controller - something that not all players are comfortable with or find easy to do.\n\nI'm sure the game has its good points, but when I am already put off by the controller options (or lack thereof) I really would not recommend this game to anyone who, like me, uses a keyboard and mouse when gaming.","April 25, 2015","false","0.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Like others I do not feel its worth the asking price. The next is the control, I don't know how many times I died because Red failed to grab a ledge that she clearly should have grabbed.  However there isn't really a penalty for dying. The difficult setting are practically meaningless. I couldn't run the game smoothly even on my overpowered PC. The sneak aspect of the game is practically not even worth having. I could go on but overall...\n\nThe game needs patchwork and lacks depth.","May 19, 2015","false","0.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

They were really passionate about their product. Unfortunately it seems a lot of inexperience was their downfall. The character controls are both floaty and stiff at the same time and it's very hard, particularly in "combat", to get a feel for where you are aiming and moving. There seems to be a disconnect between character animation and actual movement which throws you off.\n\nIn addition there's a fair amount of cheap deaths in the game of the sort you usually see only in  hardcore platformers. It's basically an unavoidable death unless you've already played the level and therefore know that it's coming. You have no fair chance of reacting to it if you don't know it's coming. I do not agree with that design decision for this game. It doesn't fit with it's more story-heavy puzzle/platformer style.\n\nThere's some sections, particularly early in the game, where you are stuck doing nothing for long stretches of time which really messes with the pacing. There's one particular area where you are drifting on a raft over water and it's downright painfully slow as it involves no interaction and it's just waiting around. A platformer should not involve these kinds of slow moments but should be flowing and fluid in their gameplay.\n\nThe writing and voice acting are decent, but extremely cringeworthy. It kind of feels like "it's trying too hard" to be edgy and dark, and thus ends up coming across as juvenile. I'm not completely clear on whether this is because of the voice actor used or the writing, but I end up cringing a lot during the times the main character speaks. Speak she does. A LOT. There's barely a moment she won't shut up and that is also distracting, because at times you may be busy fighting a horde of enemies or desperately trying to avoid being crushed by something to listen to the dialogue and therefore end up missing important(?) bits of the story.\n\nAll in all, I think Woolfe is a valiant attempt but the fixed perspective, the floaty controls, very awkward combat and the cringeworthy writing really pulls it down from something that could've been really good. It's not a terrible game, but unfortunately in a world of many better platformers, it's just plain average.","March 21","false","1.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Sadly, this game did not make a good first impression.  It is a shame too, because I like the idea behind this: a dark take on the classic Red Riding Hood tale, made into an action game.  You could say this is similar in concept to that of Alice in Wonderland.  Even after seeing the mixed reviews, I figured that maybe I can enjoy this game.\n\nI learn that this game is not even finished.  It was released in a state where it clearly needs more ironing out.  The combat is dis-satisfying, in a way where it feels more like a beat-em-up, except there are no combo attacks, and enemies provide barely any feedback to your actions.  They'll flinch once, but will immediately attack like they felt nothing, forcing you to jump around, hoping they don't hit you.  It is almost pointless to even do the stronger attack since the damage output is barely noticeable, and it is too slow in comparison to risk doing so.  The platforming is alright, but it was not refined well enough, considering that I can speed up the climbing sections simply by jumping around, regardless of the protagonist's current state; although there are invisible walls in place that, although would look as if you can cross, you are actually prevented from doing so because that is not how the game is played.  Fixing the problem by adding another is not good game design.\n\nThe presentation is really awkward to look at too.  The graphics for the environment are really good, but the character models look more like lifeless dolls (not counting the enemies, of course), and it's quite a contrast, especially when you look at Piper's model.  The actress displays emotion in what seems to be awkward moments that doesn't seem to be called for, or is she calling out to the villain?  He never talks at all, and the line of dialogue sounds as if it would be narration text... it is disorienting.  It is a shame though.  The actress actually sounds like she was doing a good job with the character.  My most annoying gripe with her is the constant rhyming of her lines, including lines that should not rhyme.\n\nIt is sad to say that as much as I want to like this game, it will never be fixed, and it will never be continued.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BirdCute/recommended/281940/","BirdCute","BirdCute","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BirdCute/","1507 products in account","Woolfe - The Red Hood Diaries is an interesting adventure game that takes some of the characters from the well-known tale Little Red Riding Hood. This game sends you to an unforgettable journey to avenge Hood's parents.\nIf this review is too long for you, I suggest you to only read the first paragraph about the game's content and the final verdict at the end.\n\nWhat is happening in the game:Red Riding Hood has lost both of her parents and now, grown up and strong, seeks revenge. With her axe, she slays everyone who stands in her way. The bad guys is B.B. Woolfe, a CEO of a big corporation, who is also involved in a series of disappearances of young girls.\n\nPros:    The graphics are really good. Don't expect to see the same thing as in screenshots (which look unrealistically good), but the art is still very good-looking.\nI really love the voice acting. The enthusiasm in the woman's voice really fits the story and the character of Hood itself.\nThe story is simple and, on moments, really deep and heart-touching.\nThe atmosphere in this game is really amazing. The surroundings and the soundtrack blend together perfectly with the story. Magical.\nI know this is appealing to some people, so I'm just gonna mention it: this game is suitable for speedrunning.\nIt's not a big thing, but if Hood is telling a story and you die, she doesn't stop talking. In some other games, characters usually start over.\nBy discovering hidden W symbols, you also unlock diary pages, which are pretty interesting.\nRed Riding Hood looks awesome!\nCons:    Fighting system is kind of bland. You can pretty much do everything just by mashing the A button and pointing to where you want to hit with your axe. It's still fun, but it's too easy.\nAt certain points of the story, there will be rhymes. But they're not always present, just for a few verses and then normal story again. And these rhymes are mostly imperfect, which is (for me) annoying.\nI don't like the shape of the health bar as it is sometimes misrepresenting your actual health. If you're not used to it, you may sometimes be surprised when you see you're low on health.\nAnother game with no MacOS and Linux support. What a shame.\nThe final verdict:Some people say there is not enough content in this game for 10$. I don't really agree with that as my experience with this game was really good. The story is really nice and the whole games has a great atmosphere. The visuals, music and voice acting combine together into a marvellous experience.\nI highly recommend it. If you're not willing to pay that much for a 3-4 hour game, I really suggest buying it on a sale.\n\nGreetings,\nBirdCute\n\nNote that my copy of this game was obtained for free for reviewing purposes.

Some elements shine so you know you can grab in there, but other do not sou you hace to guess where to grab, aaaand, same elements you can grab on and jump onto, in other parts of the level you cant. Platforming in this game is just confusing as hell. The level desing is ♥♥♥♥, it look like the same scenery again and again. The first part is, lets call it barely easy, but, the devs took it away and change the final level into some Dark Souls platforming, making it unfairly hard.\n\nThe animations are not fair.

If you fail you get dropped back at the previous checkpoint and have to start over.\n\n-collision detection can get wonky at times and if it happens while you're jumping on a platform you'll be out of luck.\n\n-insipid combat with no parry, no stealth kills, bad enemy AI. It basically boils down to hitting an enemy, moving back a bit to avoid getting hit and so on...if you're facing more than one enemy then you'll have to find a way to get them stuck somewhere or just jump around to avoid them until you can get a hit in, rinse and repeat. It's dull.\n\n-boss fights are pretty uninteresting affairs and carry all the problems mentioned above.\n\n-the other characters in the story are only given backgrounds in the collectible diaries, if you miss them there's no dialogue at all to give them some depth.\n\n-story ends abruptly with a cliffhanger and fails to wrap at least a few things up in a rewarding manner.\n\n-pretty short, you'll get through it in 2 hours\n\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=470840299\n\nWoolfe feels like a missed opportunity, this is no American McGee's Alice for sure.\nProviding a generally dull and unsatisfying experience both in platforming and combat leaves the game as a pretty forgettable experience punctuated by a few genuinely frustrating parts whenever the game problems come up more than usual.\n\nIn the end what feels really aggravating is the fact that platforming seems more of a question of luck than anything else, the skewed perspective and collision make you feel as any mistake wasn't really your fault. Same goes for combat where you're not given many tools to work with and need to use the AI's faults against itself to survive expecially if you play on Hard.\n\nI got this for peanuts on a bundle and it might be considered ok for that price or on a big sale, but anything else seems too much sadly.","June 28, 2015","false","2.8"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

The platforming elements are uneven, clunky and very easy. The combat is simplistic, unresponsive and unsatisfying.  The enemies are either no threat at all or damage sponges. The first two boss fights feel like an after thought.\n\nThe game barely explains its mechanics. The combat tutorials ask you to use the ability it is teaching...using up the energy you've gathered. It does this even during the final boss fight.\n\nIt took me 112 minutes to pass the game, without rushing through it.

It's clear that a lot of love and attention went into Woolfe, but sadly, it was spent in the wrong areas. At first glance, it's hard to tell why this game didn't do well. In terms of aesthetics, GRIN 100% nailed it with art and environments that suck the player into a unique setting. Regrettably, the praise ends there, as the game's shortcomings become apparant almost immediately. If half as much care and detail went into this game's combat as went into its cosmetics, things might have gone differently. As it stands, though, Woolfe offers poor controls and sloppy, terrible combat in one of the prettiest, shortest games you'll ever play.

When I say very short, I am talking maaaaaybe 2 hours if you take your time. So purchase on sale - it's worth $5, but it's a stretch to think there is $10 of content in this game.\n\n2) It may have a look reminiscent of American McGee's Alice, and that's a positive of the experience, but the similarity is only skin deep. If twisted fairy tales are your thing, you likely won't find too much satisfaction here.\n\nWOOLFE: The Red Hood Diaries Review - Truly an example of style over substance.\n\nThis 2.5D sidescrolling platformer/puzzler initially strikes you as being a remarkably polished offering from developer GrIN but it doesn't take long to figure out that this slick presentation is literally only skin-deep.\n\nAll elements outside of graphic presentation are passable, but not special.\nThe combat is average - not a detriment, but certainly not a positive.\nThe puzzles are generally speaking rather tame and unexciting involving a bit of back and forth, flipping the occasional switch and progressing relatively unimpeded.\nThe platforming is uninspired and basic, but again, not enough to say it's bad, just... not interesting.\nThe story starts promisingly but quickly falls flat\nThere is one collectible type, so there is no real added depth for completionists to replay the game.\nSo, again, there are no missteps per se, but there is no innovation either. Where a game like Ori and the Blind Forest pushes the genre in a way to create a new experience, Woolfe is perfectly content to be average throughout, if not a little below in several aspects.\n\nThe controls are awkward - and one pet peeve of mine is when the controller is your highest bar of difficulty. Jumps can be inaccurate, sending you to your death on what should be a relatively straightforward action.\n\nWoolfe is not a bad game, but not a game that most would need in their libraries. The short length, lack of replay value, and overall average underlying game play makes the only high point it's presentation, and if you want that, I am sure there are wallpapers you can put your desktop for a week a year to get your fix.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=456674421","June 6, 2015","false","1.2"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

Woolfe. The game was supposed to be an episodic title and can now be brought in its entirety.\nThe main beef of Woolfe is about navigating the various levels as Red Riding Hood from a platform to another (and create one if necessary) and defeat the enemies who'll try to stop you. The protagonist comes armed with an axe and some special moves that consume a dedicated meter. Scattered through the levels are collectables that unlock concept art and interesting bits about the game's setting in the main menu.\nSimply put, however, Woolfe - The Red Hood Diaries could had been a great game with serious American McGee's Alice vibes, but at this point it's just a mere skeleton of a proper title. To name some of the issues:\n- The game is incredibly short, clocking about two hours at worst\n- The enemies selection is simply abysmal. Also, the only two bosses featured aren't exactly thrilling\n- The combat system is very simplistic, to the point of being a chore more than anything else (the three difficulties offered, easy, normal and hard, do little to change this)\n- The placing of checkpoints is questionable at best (this becomes an annoyance in the final part of the game, where the platforming experiences a severe jump in difficulty)\n- The game could had used more voice actors, that's for sure\n- The plot isn't as fleshed out as it should be (but then again, the game is two hours long)\nOf course Woolfe - The Red Hood Diaries have its own redeeming factors, like a genuinely unique and inspired artistic direction and the Red Riding Hood's monologues (which are always spoken in rhymes and manage to be funny and interesting), but as it stands the game it's only worth a purchase during a strong sale","May 13, 2015","false","2.4"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

While I liked the idea and the aesthetic, I found quite a few things lacking, that maybe I should have done a little more research on.\n\nPros:\n- Aesthetically pleasing.  The game looks great on a graphics standpoint.\n\n- Narration while playing.  I'm typically a fan of games that do this, and I enjoy a bit of back-story being told to me while I play.\n\n\nCons:\n- Combat is rather lackluster.  You learn up to a total of 6 moves by the end of the game, but for the most part you'll only be using your typical normal or heavy swings, since the 4 other moves require mana to spend and drain it rather fast.\n\n- Lack of enemy variety.  There's a total of 6 enemies I believe?  Which includes the 2 bosses.  Maybe if you throw in the 2 other variations of the tin-soldiers you could chalk it up to 8.\n\n- Script was pretty bad, while I do enjoy the overall theme, the script just falls short of delivering anything more then a rather angry Red Hood who is out for revenge.  It rhymes and I have no problem with that, but it doesn't always rhyme, and is rather inconsistent in doing so.\n\n- Extremely short.  I have roughly 3 hours put into this game only because I restarted the game so a friend could watch me play.\n\n- 2.5 D platforming is pretty bad.  The foreground and background can be extremely misleading at times, and the forest level in particular is frustrating due to moving platforms that come in and out of the fore/background.\n\n- Music starts out pretty good, but becomes extremely repetitive because most of the songs feel like they are only 1 minute long and just play in a constant loop.\n\nOverall I was sorely disappointed with this game.  I liked the theme and the aesthetic but I just found the follow-through to be completely lacking.  I think they spent more time on the graphics then the actual gameplay.

And that is because I'm being nice. This has terrible game play. Combat is all types of screwed up. No blocking. No targeting. Hack and slash that barely ever hits anything. Horrible health indicator. Actually horrible health, I was dieing while still having health.  Battles for story is too easy, while boss battles are difficult and hard to figure out. Half the time you have no idea what is going on. It explains next to nothing, you know the main thing that she is avenging her father, that's about it. It doesn't even explain these symbols you are suppose to get. Holes in the world so you are near the edge and you fall thru or you try to jump and some how you get stuck on something no where near you. Or the game just suddenly puts you in another spot. I could probably go on and on, but that would be really rude and also it's 2am where I am at and I am tired.

For the most part it is a pretty average simplistic 2.5d platforming/fighting game.\n\nThe environments are pretty nice and for the most part everything looks and sounds as it should. The story and its characters are nothing to write home about but they provide some context and they are fine enough. The game is very short but i am completely fine with a game like this not lasting more than 2-3 hours.\n\nFor the most part this game is competent even though it doesn't really exceed in anything either. But it does have some shortcomings. The 2.5 D platforming can get a bit annoying when you are supposed to judge the distance in the z-axis at certain camera angles. There are also some annoying invisble walls at times and if you try to jump to a platform you are not supposed to jump to then you might just fall right through it.\n\nThe combat works for the most part even though it is pretty basic and button mashy. But at certain locations there are some instant death attacks from the enemies that are just plain annoying.\n\nThese problems could just be minor stuff but the checkpoint system makes them into an annoyance. Overall i didn't have an especially good time with this game even though it certainly is not a terrible game. I also can't shake of the impression that the game were meant to be much more than it currently is. I don't really want to rate this game with a thumb up or thumb down but if a friend would ask then i would probably not recommend this game if it is not the case that he is starving for a 2.5 platformer game with some basic combat.","July 2, 2015","false","2.3"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

I love the art direction. It is a beautiful game. But at the end of the day, there are simply too many jarring moments that take me away from its beauty. How Red interacts with characters, how she talks to herself ("I wish I'd left my nose at home today!"....Seriously?), the clunky combat system, and the simple fact that it's just way too short for $10 (you can get so many different games for $10 or cheaper with a vastly larger amount of playtime).\n\nI'm glad they at least implimented something that sort of explains your sudden gain of magic (but not really, your suddenly more powerful and you don't know why) versus during the beta there was no mention, just a tooltip.\n\nBut ultimately, the story is just not that interesting. It could have been, but it really isn't. It's farily predictable and bland.\nI have hope for the studio in the future. They've shown they can make a captivating looking game.

The game was so ultimately beautiful that it seemed to hold much promise for a dream come true. But The game felt like a long demo or a game still in alpha. The game felt like it almost had a solid story until midway and closer to the end which then it started to feel rush like hurry up lets finish the game to meet a deadline instead of getting an immersive experience that could have been an instant classic. There was only 1 mini boss and 1 big boss and then a final boss. Most games have atleast 6-8 bosses and more stages. The Grin devs did do right by warning the public that it was a short put into 2 volumes. But they didn't finish the first volume. Usually an great epic game has a full finished plot and then the sequel continues it. I would have kept it in development until they had more material and made this game the powerful gem it was meant to be. This game was also very glitchy even on the lowest settings. The character you play she likes to run backwards alot and the screen glitches around alot making the game completely unplayable at times forcing me to have to exit and restart the game. I play all my steam games on my windows surface pro 3 and it plays all hi end games especially if u dial back the resolution to a low setting. Like I said this game has so much potential and very gorgeous to play when it does work, but I hope the next "volume" improves immensly and gives the players a completed experience with minor to no glitches at all and leave a customer satisfied. I wouldn't be surprised to see someone try to knock this game off just to give gamers the  full "red" experience. My suggestion is to not supply a release date for the 2nd volume and get all the kinks out before it is even close released. I do want to tell the Grin team thank you for how fast you were still able to deliver this game with the high quality of graphic content provided and for their efforts.","April 19, 2015","false","23.3"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

You might save yourself some money https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8aW_FlvySQ&index=1&list=PLPlmMG2nBL-5ZPGdv0C4YmJ2-Iw5FDkBF\n\nGame has some good points.\nArt style is nice (however see below)\nStory idea is nice (and right up my street)\nVoice acting is actually really nice, Michelle Sparks did a really good job with Red.\n\nHowever these are just good starting points that make a good game. Unfortunately the game does not expand on these and is followed up with terrible flaws.\nArt style is nice like I said, however it looks like Fable 2, a game that came out almost 7 years ago. This wouldn't be too bad if the game was an open world like Fable, but it’s very linear and very short.\nSpeaking of short, I beat this game in 2 hours. I feel like even if I wanted to get 100% of the steam achievements it wouldn’t take more than 5 hours total (3 hours of going back and collecting all the collectables and various speed achievements) Would I say that £7.00, as it was at the time I bought it, be worth 2 hours of game time? I’d say that I could be. But in this case no, this game just wasn’t fun.\n\nI started the game with good expectations and was looking forward to it. The story is the kind of thing I go and have enjoyed in the past. I get into the game and look at the controls. I’m a PC gamer and if possible I play with mouse and keyboard. Rebind able keys is a good start! Oh what’s that? I can’t bind basic and strong attacks to my mouse, like every hack and slash that has ever been on PC? Okay... that’s interesting. I ended up using WASD for movement basic attacks on e, strong attacks on q and sprint, magic and sneak on left shift, control and alt respectively and this felt okay for me.\nOkay so next up we learn the basics of movement etc. and I see the double jump animation. I get that it is actually physically impossible to double jump and it might be difficult to make a nice animation for it, but there have been answers for that in platforming games for years. My advice? I wouldn’t have put double jump in the game. The animation just looks awful and there are different mechanics they could have put in place.\n\nOkay so we move on and have to do some sneaking as we don’t have a weapon yet, okay that fine. I personally hate sneaking segments done like they did. Sneaking feels too slow and pointless. You can actually just sprint and outrun the enemies but that’s not the point. When we do finally get a weapon, the axe, the animation quality just gets worse. It feels pretty unsatisfactory to kill enemies in the game. You just stand hitting the attack button till things die. The only challenging fight is the last boss, and the random 1 hit kill enemy that they make no mention of and is just a thing you have to sneak by (I ran past him) and is never seen again, and that’s not even hard just a case of waiting for him to attack and running out of the way.\n\nI could go on about the bad points of this game but I feel like I’m beating a dead horse at this point.\nPlease watch a video on the game before you buy it to make sure its something you want to spend your money on. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8aW_FlvySQ&index=1&list=PLPlmMG2nBL-5ZPGdv0C4YmJ2-Iw5FDkBF is the playlist of my playthrough of this game.\n","March 19, 2015","false","2.0"," 7 of 18 people (39%) found this review helpful","39","7","18","0","0"

Say goodbye to the easy days of mouse looking, and hello to confusing arrow controls, who needs to see where they are going, I like the added difficulty of maneuvering while staring at the ceiling.\n\nBut seriously, this game mechanic wise is a nightmare on PC. If you want to play a game with keyboard controls from the 90's then go for it because nothing can be bound to the mouse (attacks keys etc), the camera is controlled by the number keys, and trying to get any type of support for this game through steam support is about as helpful as getting punched in the crotch. Go for it try asking an question on Steam Support about In Game Issues then click contact Support it sends you to the games website then you click support and it sends your right back to Steam Support in a clusterfawk loop of no help at all.\n\nI purchaced this game because it reminded me of Alice Madness Returns. Visually it looks promising however if your like me, and not a fan of change then your going to have a bad time. I loaded it up, was getting excited about exploring the world. Got to the start up area where she spawns in her room hit the W button to move around and nothing. Then I noticed there wasn't a cursor. So I thought simple mistake i'll go to setting and just change up the controls to keyboard cause I thought maybe it thought I was using a controller.\n\nWell it will let me bind WASD to movement but it won't let you bind the attack buttons to the mouse, hell the mouse is nonexistant. Seriously who makes a PC game without a mouse? Guess Mice are to mainstream. Then I saw the camera movement was via the number keys, and was like o.O who thought that was a good idea? So I tried to see if there was an option to change it to the mouse wheel...nope. Basically its a PC game without your typical PC Game controls, and unfortunitly i'm going to have to bite the bullet on this one. So you're welcome for my 10 dollar donation for your game I will never play. So overall this entire experience reminded me why Ieft Steam years ago and joined the console race where for the most part Camera controls never change, and attack buttons are always going to be pretty much in the same area.","March 20, 2015","false","0.1"," 6 of 17 people (35%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","35","6","17","0","0"

The choices that went into designing this title would have allowed for a wider freedom of exploration, but most of the platforms and spaces are sealed off by invisible walls, and the game tends to be linear and tedious as players are held by their hands throughout the narration. The collectibles system deserves a special mention, as each of these items unlock additional details about the story as well as parts of the “Did You Know?” series, a collection of curiosities about the development stages and the background of the game. Good looks and an engaging narration are not enough to make Woolfe – The Red Hood Diaries a good game, though. The title can still be enjoyed, if players are ready to grind past the repetitive gameplay, the button-mashing and the glitches. All in all, an average title that could be worth its $9.99 price tag, but that should only be bought as soon as it goes on sale.\n\nread the full review here: http://www.gamerheadlines.com/reviews/woolfe-the-red-hood-diaries/","March 25, 2015","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The graphics are awesome, the gameplay is easy to take in hands yet still hard enough to get difficulties playing it.\n\nI can't wait to get the next chapter of the game, as i am still waiting for the end of that cinematic when i saw the "To Be Continued" message, letting me speechless and drooling waiting;\n\nI really hope to see the following of that game, hoping that GRIN will keep up the good work and the amazing soundtrack / voices.\n\nThrough the cameras are bad sometimes, and the movements stuck (for the mini-game "run away") but in general, that game IS worth buying, playing, and retrying.

The music was good, and the environments were aesthetically pleasing. The storyline wasn't bad, but I think it definitely could've been improved upon. Also, the lip-syncing doesn't match up with what the characters are saying, and it becomes very noticable by the end of the game.\n\nThe combat is nothing special - you can either attack regularly with an axe, or use a heavy attack. There are two bosses to battle in the game. The first boss fight is insane, as one wrong move and you need to start all the way from the beginning. I had at one point gotten the boss near death just to be insta-killed by one of his attacks. The second boss has some insta-kill attacks as well. It's pretty annoying.\n\nThe camera angles were a little obnoxious, but nothing that really stopped me from advancing through certain parts of the game.\n\nI was able to beat the game in two hours, and that was with having to continually restart from checkpoints due to several deaths. I'm sure if I had tried to go for collectables as well, it would've lasted a little longer.\n\nWhile I did overall enjoy the game despite its flaws, I wouldn't recommend buying it at full price. I paid two dollars for it, and that seems pretty fair for what you're getting.

I just stayed a bit and thought it was already fully activated. If it was a directly relation, like, the longer I stay, the higher the gate go... and also it is kinda misplaced, its a weird place for the switch.. I know it seems like there should be a timer-challenge with the water there, but controlling the character in this very tiny space is the real challenge, not the water\n- Some times on the game you feel you get killed very unfairly, without having the time to think, and thats almost always bad design, lots of game have it, since crash bandicoot (this game makes me remember crash a lot hehe), but I feel I should reiterate it\n\nSe.. and I only played it for like one hour... so I think not testing the game really killed the mood.\n\nWould it be very difficult to have a bunch of people to play it before releasing? I think this would have made the game a lot better.\n\nAt some point of the optimization you would start to run in circles, like one feedback directly nulls another one, and thats normal, thats the point where the game is well adjusted, but I think it was released far from this point.\n\nThe red rood voice is really sexy and made my ♥♥♥♥ rock hard and I like it but... the game itself has a lot of design problems :(\n\nAlso, I couldnt play the game even on 1280x720. My graphics card is kinda old, geforce GTS 450, but with everything on low, I'd like to play at least on 16:9.. but it is too slow. I have to change to 1024x768, 4:3,  and play windowed.\n\nAnyway, I liked it.. I've read about the "unsucess" of this game but I dont think it was like that.

For every good thing that can be said about it there is a negative point to counter it. In the end I've decided to upvote it but it's mostly because I, personally, enjoy fairytale-themed games and platformers very much and so playing Woolfe has been a pleasant experience for me overall. However, it might not be everyone's cup of tea.\n\nThe game has in my opinion some fantastic level design. No two levels look the same. The environment can go from gloomy to vibrant and colorful and the levels definitely have that fairytale charm to them. The music, too, is incredibly charming. That said there are only a few, level-specific tracks and listening to them over and over throughout the course of the level can get irritatingly repetitive. The fact that there are few other sound effects makes this hard to ignore - especially since Red herself is the only character in the game who ever speaks. (There is another character who gets a line or two but 99% of the game is one long monologue.) I say this so that you can understand me when I say the game lacks atmosphere. The ingredients to make an immersive game are there but they are very poorly managed.\n\nFor all the good work that was put into this game, it all falls a bit flat because Woolfe takes itself way more seriously than it can afford in the end. The story tries to be quite dark and full of twists, and I do believe it could have been a pretty good story at that, if only the game were at least three or four times longer than it is and if it dropped the (beautiful, stunning, really) fairytale visuals. It's just hard to see B. B. Woolfe as the monstrous villain he is intended to be when his city looks more like Santa's Christmas village than a den of evil and when you can never see a single person actually suffering because of him and mostly have to take Red's word for it all. The game's beauty ends up being one of it's biggest flaws simply because it clashes so obviously with the dark nature of the plot. Separately the plot and the delivery could both have been very good, but when you put it together it just does not work. It doesn't work and it makes me sad because Woolfe could have been a very good game.\n\nAs for the technical side of it - the game controls nicely, the combo system is a sweet touch, but again it's not perfect. The other big problem I have with this game is the HP system, which I just don't understand at all. When you die in combat, you respawn basically right where you died, making death absolutely inconsequential. It's also a good thing, though, because when it comes to environmental hazards, the game is utterly merciless and any contact with any spikes or saws or, heck, even a log that stands in your way, is an instant one-hit K.O. Sometimes even a slightly misjudged jump will have Red dying with a blood-curdling scream of pain when really all she did was trip on a twig, making some of the deaths in the game terribly annoying and hilarious at the same time (did I mention you can get killed by poop?). Items that increase your HP are scattered across the levels but I never once needed them because when I did actually find myself low on health I would soon die and respawn with full health on the spot once more. The whole thing just doesn't make sense.\n\nThe difficulty levels are well balanced, at least. That is to say, playing the game on easy will not take much effort, beating the game on normal actually gave me a sense of accomplishment because I did struggle several times, especially with the bosses, who I feel are actually reasonably challenging without taking /too/ long to beat. And playing the game on hard really feels like you have to focus on your combat strategy a little if you want to make progress. Collecting the diary entries for the achievements can be a pain, though. It took me longer than I'd like to admit to realize that even though the game says certain entries are in certain levels, they are in fact found in the preceding levels. That's just a btw tip from one achievement hunter to others.\n\nLike I said, this game has a lot of charm that would have definitely paid off had the devs only spent much, much more time working on it. It should take way more than 2 hours to go through this story - a story that does not fit the environment it's set in at all and a story that ends with an annoying cliffhanger on top of it. As it is Woolfe is just a not bad, not great platformer for a lazy afternoon (or if you're fast enough, possibly just a free lunch break).","October 29, 2015","true","5.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

After I got a "to be continued" 2 hours in, I searched the dev and saw what happened.

The music and general look of the environments is great, the town has a bit of the fable 2 feel to it, I love it.\n\nOn the kickstarter page it says "mindless hack n' slash combat this is not". It is, but I don't really care.\n\nThe story is a neat idea, but the writing could have used some revision to maybe take a bit of the emo out of Red.\n\nI had frustrating moments platformin and combat to be sure, but for the most part I enjoyed this game and would definitely recommend it while its on sale.

The music was good, and the environments were aesthetically pleasing. The storyline wasn't bad, but I think it definitely could've been improved upon. Also, the lip-syncing doesn't match up with what the characters are saying, and it becomes very noticable by the end of the game.\n\nThe combat is nothing special - you can either attack regularly with an axe, or use a heavy attack. There are two bosses to battle in the game. The first boss fight is insane, as one wrong move and you need to start all the way from the beginning. I had at one point gotten the boss near death just to be insta-killed by one of his attacks. The second boss has some insta-kill attacks as well. It's pretty annoying.\n\nThe camera angles were a little obnoxious, but nothing that really stopped me from advancing through certain parts of the game.\n\nI was able to beat the game in two hours, and that was with having to continually restart from checkpoints due to several deaths. I'm sure if I had tried to go for collectables as well, it would've lasted a little longer.\n\nWhile I did overall enjoy the game despite its flaws, I wouldn't recommend buying it at full price. I paid two dollars for it, and that seems pretty fair for what you're getting.

Its really short. Ends on a cliff hanger.\n\n\nThe story was somewhat interesting. The platforming was okay, movement felt great, the combat however was terrible. Youre given a health bar, which is often times made useless because of one shot mechanics, and theres a lot of them. Within the platforming and boss fights. There are no lives or continues or game overs. So death is pretty irrelevant it feels as if it were there just to slow you down.\n\nThe game is also really short and ends with a cliff hanger. To my understanding the company went bankrupt or something so there wont be a sequel, and the game ends really abruptly. I was left feeling really unsatisfied.\nEdit: Turns out the company did some stuff with Kickstarter or something so we may actually get to see a proper ending.\n\nThe speach was also somewhat off putting. Sometimes it rhymes sometimes it doesnt and a lot of the time they use odd words to force it to rhyme. The game itself seemed to be a "serious" game. With the slogan (Might not be the right word) being "This isnt a fairytale, theres nothing fair about it" it atleast SEEMS like it should have been serious but the protagonist often makes bad jokes that somewhat kill the mood. ("Thanks! You rock!" after riding on a rock) The protagonists voice actor has a pretty nice voice, but her voice acting was kinda meh there was emphasis on words when there shouldnt have been and vice versa.\n\nId say youtube a play through of it.

With a fantastic soundtrack, terrific graphics, and an interesting twist to the old Red Ridinghood fairy tale, this game certainly doesn't deserve the mixed reviews it has. While not a perfect game, it makes the most of what it gives and made for an overall enjoyable experiance.\n\nRating: 7.5 / 10 good fun for an hour or two, but not worth $10\n\nPros:\n\nFantastic graphics - bright and sharp contrasting colors fit the fantasy genre of the game\nExellent lighting - the game effectively created a surreal mood, very fitting for a fairy tale\nFun platforming - many people complianed about the 3D platforming being annoying, but I rather enjoyed it. While it was sometimes difficult to see what was a platform and what was the background, I saw this as an extra challege that promtes a little exploration and taking a leap of faith\nAmazing soundtrack - just listen to it\n\nCons:\n\nthere are only 2 voice-acted characters - just a minor gripe, but I believe some other characters should have been voice-acted as well\nlength - this is a rather short game, and I didn't feel it was challenging enough to make up for the short story\ncombat - very simplistic hack & slash, while not broken, it feels out of place in a flowing fantasy land\n\nIn closing, I thoroughly enjoyed this game, but was a little dissapointed by it's length. If it's on sale, I recommend picking it up for a weekend playthrough.","January 30","true","9.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Everything in this game seems like it could be passable with just a little work, but none of it actually is. The story is almost non-existant and ends with a cliffhanger after a mere 2 hours of gameplay. One which will of course never be resolved with GriN shutting their doors. The acting is flat, with boring dialogue. The combat is as bare bones you can get, but in a frustrating way. Enemies will maul you repeatedly with no invincibility frames or way to block attacks, even though they can block attacks. Level design makes little to no sense with poor flow and construction. The game is also divided into basically 3 major sections: a free roaming combat heavy first area in Ulrica and it's sewers, a platform heavy forest area, and a foot race against a carriage. All three have major issues with their design.\n\nIn Ulrica there are several enemies that can flat out oneshot you with little indication of this capability, and the combat is not good enough to focus an entire first part of the game around it. Once you get to the forest area you realize how hilariously awful the games platform detection is. One spot in particular shows you a lower floor you need to jump around spikes to land on, but it would be easier to just drop down. Problem is, if you never hit the jump button you die the moment you land on the platform. This section is riddled with this sort of confusing platform detection issues. And lastly the foot race will routinely split the course into two lanes, but you better guess the right one! Because one will be a dead end that instant kills you with no way to recover into the other lane, just a restart.\n\n2/10 - Almost no redeeming value. Only bright spots are Red's model quality is considerably better than the environments, and controls are at least generally responsive.","January 28","false","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Initially the gameplay mechanics were full of glitches when I first played it and this was back with the shorter version. However hte longer version seems to be devoid of the glitches. So overall here are the pros and cons;\nPros\n+ Good story/adaptation\n+ Beautifully designed and fairytale like environments/levels\n+ Good voice over\n+ Smooth gameplay\n\nCons\n- Linear combat (limited fight moves and attacks)\n- Not enough challenging enemies or bosses or puzzles\n- Occassional glitching and hanging\n- Not much to explore due to limited access to environment\n\nStill I would highly recommend for those who are an avid fan of American McGee's Alice Madness returns,  this game might quench your thirst for more when you're missing the good old Madness returns experience.

Even as is Woolfe is a fun and beautiful "Alice" style platformer worth any fan of the genre's attention.  Over all the game is far more polished than most Indie titles and definitly comes off as a much larger budget game.  I hope to see at least some members of Grin be able to continue what they started and if not, than I hope they realize what they accomplished is amazing.","October 23, 2015","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The music was good, and the environments were aesthetically pleasing. The storyline wasn't bad, but I think it definitely could've been improved upon. Also, the lip-syncing doesn't match up with what the characters are saying, and it becomes very noticable by the end of the game.\n\nThe combat is nothing special - you can either attack regularly with an axe, or use a heavy attack. There are two bosses to battle in the game. The first boss fight is insane, as one wrong move and you need to start all the way from the beginning. I had at one point gotten the boss near death just to be insta-killed by one of his attacks. The second boss has some insta-kill attacks as well. It's pretty annoying.\n\nThe camera angles were a little obnoxious, but nothing that really stopped me from advancing through certain parts of the game.\n\nI was able to beat the game in two hours, and that was with having to continually restart from checkpoints due to several deaths. I'm sure if I had tried to go for collectables as well, it would've lasted a little longer.\n\nWhile I did overall enjoy the game despite its flaws, I wouldn't recommend buying it at full price. I paid two dollars for it, and that seems pretty fair for what you're getting. Any more than that, and I feel like it would be a rip off.","October 26, 2015","true","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ShiryaW/recommended/281940/","ShiryaW","ShiryaW","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ShiryaW/","52 products in account","Woolfe is an interesting game in which some poor decisions were made. For every good thing that can be said about it there is a negative point to counter it. In the end I've decided to upvote it but it's mostly because I, personally, enjoy fairytale-themed games and platformers very much and so playing Woolfe has been a pleasant experience for me overall. However, it might not be everyone's cup of tea.\n\nThe game has in my opinion some fantastic level design. No two levels look the same. The environment can go from gloomy to vibrant and colorful and the levels definitely have that fairytale charm to them. The music, too, is incredibly charming. That said there are only a few, level-specific tracks and listening to them over and over throughout the course of the level can get irritatingly repetitive. The fact that there are few other sound effects makes this hard to ignore - especially since Red herself is the only character in the game who ever speaks. (There is another character who gets a line or two but 99% of the game is one long monologue.) I say this so that you can understand me when I say the game lacks atmosphere. The ingredients to make an immersive game are there but they are very poorly managed.\n\nFor all the good work that was put into this game, it all falls a bit flat because Woolfe takes itself way more seriously than it can afford in the end. The story tries to be quite dark and full of twists, and I do believe it could have been a pretty good story at that, if only the game were at least three or four times longer than it is and if it dropped the (beautiful, stunning, really) fairytale visuals. It's just hard to see B. B. Woolfe as the monstrous villain he is intended to be when his city looks more like Santa's Christmas village than a den of evil and when you can never see a single person actually suffering because of him and mostly have to take Red's word for it all. The game's beauty ends up being one of it's biggest flaws simply because it clashes so obviously with the dark nature of the plot. Separately the plot and the delivery could both have been very good, but when you put it together it just does not work. It doesn't work and it makes me sad because Woolfe could have been a very good game.\n\nAs for the technical side of it - the game controls nicely, the combo system is a sweet touch, but again it's not perfect. The other big problem I have with this game is the HP system, which I just don't understand at all. When you die in combat, you respawn basically right where you died, making death absolutely inconsequential. It's also a good thing, though, because when it comes to environmental hazards, the game is utterly merciless and any contact with any spikes or saws or, heck, even a log that stands in your way, is an instant one-hit K.O. Sometimes even a slightly misjudged jump will have Red dying with a blood-curdling scream of pain when really all she did was trip on a twig, making some of the deaths in the game terribly annoying and hilarious at the same time (did I mention you can get killed by poop?). Items that increase your HP are scattered across the levels but I never once needed them because when I did actually find myself low on health I would soon die and respawn with full health on the spot once more. The whole thing just doesn't make sense.\n\nThe difficulty levels are well balanced, at least. That is to say, playing the game on easy will not take much effort, beating the game on normal actually gave me a sense of accomplishment because I did struggle several times, especially with the bosses, who I feel are actually reasonably challenging without taking /too/ long to beat. And playing the game on hard really feels like you have to focus on your combat strategy a little if you want to make progress. Collecting the diary entries for the achievements can be a pain, though. It took me longer than I'd like to admit to realize that even though the game says certain entries are in certain levels, they are in fact found in the preceding levels. That's just a btw tip from one achievement hunter to others.\n\nLike I said, this game has a lot of charm that would have definitely paid off had the devs only spent much, much more time working on it. It should take way more than 2 hours to go through this story - a story that does not fit the environment it's set in at all and a story that ends with an annoying cliffhanger on top of it. As it is Woolfe is just a not bad, not great platformer for a lazy afternoon (or if you're fast enough, possibly just a free lunch break).","October 29, 2015","true","5.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The art is absolutly gorgeous, I could just drink in the visuals all day.  Level design is less great.  Most of the time it's clear where to go, but when it isn't, it really shows.  Jumps that you can ALMOST make, and invisible walls where you'd like to go abound.  The game very much loves instant kills, and you will hit spikes that blend with level terrain  dozens of times.  This becomes very clear on bosses, who have more instant kills than regular attacks, making them a trial and error fight.  A running sequence towards the end of the game has a major issue with having two branching paths, one of which will randomly kill you.  Go back and start from checkpoint.\n\nStory wise, the game suffers from being very angsty.  Red is so wrapped up in suffering that it becomes hard to take her seriously.  This is not helped by the fact that most of the game's  writing is poetry, which becomes cringe worthy fast.  Oddly, about 30% of the lines aren't rhyming though, so it becomes even more jarring  than it would normally.  The pacing of the story feels seriously off, with a forced climax coming out of nowhere and leading into a badly handled sequel hook.  The game is also only 2 hours long, which might contribute to this awkward pacing.\n\nMechanically, the game is servicible but mediocre.  Platforming is floaty, with a fixed camera sometimes making it difficult to tell where to go.  Combat is very awkward, mainly consisting of mashing light attack.  It gives you some magic attacks a short ways into the game, but these prove to deal very little damage, and have a slo-mo effect that makes them hard to use.  The combat in general feels poorly though out and in need of polish.\n\nAt the end of the day, I paid 5 dollars for the game, and got a decent amount of fun out of it.  But although it pains me to give a game that evidences some solid tallent a thumbs down, I can't recomend it at full price.  If the art interests you, consider getting it on sale.","January 29","false","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/HughJazz/recommended/281940/","HughJazz","Hugh Jazz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/HughJazz/","261 products in account","----***NOTE***---\nTHIS REVIEW IS BASED ON FIRST IMPRESSIONS, AS I'VE NOT FINISHED IT YET. IT MERELY SERVES AS FEEDBACK FOR THE DEVELOPER RATHER THAN THE USER. THE USER MAY READ THROUGH THIS TO DETERMINE IF THEY FEEL THAT WHAT IS SAID WITHIN IT SEEMS REASONABLE.\n\n\n\n\nSo I tried out the game as it seemed somewhat intriguing and new, but as I continued on playing it I had noticed several illogical gameplay moments.\n\nFor example, the game relies far too much on trial and error.\n\nNow Trial and Error games don't neccessarily have to be bad - like Abe's Oddworld has a way of making fun of the player, thus adding humor to your failures. But the Red Hood game has an odd way of punishing the player for simply being too stupid to understand what they meant as hazardous.\n\nLet us start with the tin soldiers at the start.\n\nYou have to sneak. That makes sense, seeing as you lack a weapon. No need for instructions here - it simply is logical.\n\nThen you get a weapon. Alright, now I can kill those tin ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s! Which I do without an issue. (It is also now I realize how dull the combat really is. Apart from the animation being stiff, the combat consists of nothing but either buttonmashing or  dodging followed by a little more mashing until the enemies are dead. Honestly, combat in other games is fun, but in this one, you'd much rather avoid the tin-men than fighting them. Not because they're scary, but because it's such a chore.)\n\nThat is until you meet a shock tinman. Alright, call me blind for not noticing that these have a small mace with an electric bolt within them, but the only way I found out that you have to sneak around these fellows was by dying first. An unneccessary death, but I simply accepted my fate.\n\nThen come the yellow-feathered tins. You toss the axe to clear the red-feathered tinmen quickly, and then simply mash the attack button until the yellow feathered one dies. One enemy, requires several hits because apparently he's supposed to be more difficult... Which he's not, he's simply more tedious. Oh, you can also toss the axe a few times extra to kill him.\n\nThen comes the Flute boss. It preys on your learnability which you had when you faced him once - LB+Y to do an aerial smash and kill the rats. What it fails to tell you however is that this boss will do an INSTANT DEATH attack in the middle of the whole arena. Great, trial and error on a boss. I mean don't get me wrong, it's probably a short boss but holy crap was it frustrating. Like I said, I've not finished the game and I only tried the boss twice. Might finish it some time later.\n\nWhat's even more frustrating about this boss is that the odd electrical fizzes in the middle blend with your blue effects, resulting in you getting your ♥♥♥ kicked because the effects lie to your eyes.\n\nThe platforming is great fun. A bit deceitful at times however, as some ledges appear grabbable, whereas others do not. They try to show this by sliding a faded white shine over the climbable objects, whereas the others that are not climbable do not shine. This was a huge issue for me who tends to like to play a game in fast-paced mode.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I never rush a game - when I play games I take my sweet old time - however I will never rob myself of the experience of pumping my own blood a little with a bit of "skillful" platforming (It's not skillful, but rather me nearly sacrificing myself to make a few jumps. Still though, great fun.)\n\nWhat cripples the platforming in this game is the plethora amount of invisible walls that are meant to guide the player. They only result in limiting you so that you do not speed ahead - possibly to prolong the game.\n\nWhich also reminds me - there are FAR too many moments in this game where I feel as if the developer attempted to prolong the game. For example, there are these rafts that float across the water. Alright, great. Red Hood can't swim so she needs these. A shame that THEY'RE SO GOSH DARN SLOW. Honestly, the slowness ONLY BENEFITS YOU LATER ON when you have to jump over a few obstacles. But before that - you have to ride two rafts to cross the level and then a third one where a few obstacle appear.\n\nI mean I guess it was the developers way of saying "These are slow. Have patience. Also, further on you will not have any issues jumping over these obstacles that appear."\n\nAnd again, I am all for learnability instead of awkward boxes slapping you in the face showing you what you need to do, but this moment merely seemed like an attempt of prolonging the game further than it had to.\n\nThere's also a moment like this in the sewers where you turn a wheel to make some oil stop, but this makes the steam on some pipes go faster. Alright, no problem - I get to probably disable it later. I go forth and there's a lever to open the door to the end of the level. However there's an issue. The door is currently blocked by the steamy pipes. Alright, I'll just go to the wheel and turn them off. Done. An unneccessary element to add to the game in my opinion as it serves to do nothing but prolong the game unneccessarily. At first I thought the stuff that ran from the grate was oil, which would explain the steamy pipes, but turns out it's not! As Red Hood says herself, it's the "Cities bowel movements", thus giving no reason for those pipes to steam really.\n\nWhat also messes you up is the lack of drop shadow when you do platforming. This has unneccessarly killed me several times because I miscalculated the jump because I could not tell the distance between the ... What is it, X axel of the depth?\n\nWhat's even worse is when the game decides to change FOV in mid platforming. This means that the speed and distance between objects change as well, as FOV usually determines how far away an object may look like it is.\n\nThis was ESPECIALLY A PROBLEM during the pursuit moment.\n\nApart from the controls just RANDOMLY CHANGING in the middle of it all, the game decided to throw in a bit of platforming. I took a leap of faith and it appeared as if I would land neatly upon the platform. Nope. Red Hood sunk like a rock.\n\nAlright, alive again - this time I took my sweet time and simply worked on memory. Previously it was too far, and as it was too far, Red Hood had a specific distance from the raft. This time I will lower my distance. Nope, still sunk like a rock.\n\nDuring the third time I succeeded. I landed directly upon the raft, but I felt as if all of this could've been avoided frustration if the game was decent enough to provide some feedback as to where you were while you were airborne.","July 3, 2015","false","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

This was very annoying.\n- Checkpoints are there but way too far away, respawning every enemy. There is even a place where enemies are right at a checkpoint and yes, they do respawn and will attack you right the second that you spawn.\n- the fighting mechanics are awful. This game would have been much better without the combat at all. The fighting is the absolut worst part of the game. It seems as it was thrown in there at the last second\n- difficulty settings are lazy. I hate when developers do this stuff. The enemies get more health and damage. Thats it. Combined with a broken fighting system its almost impossible on the highest difficulty, unless you wanna force yourself through a very time consuming, untested difficulty setting.\n- the game can be beaten in under 2 hours, there is almost no content here.\n- its an episodic game, that will never be concluded, but worst of all, its not even declared as one on the shop page. Which in my book is a scam.\n- the pricetagg is way too high. If you are curious, get it in a bundle sooner or later.\n\nDisappointing in a lot of aspects, I wouldnt recommend it at all.","May 22","false","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
