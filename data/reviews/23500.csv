"http://steamcommunity.com/id/positron_/recommended/23500/","positron_","ρоѕιтяои_","http://steamcommunity.com/id/positron_/","290 products in account","Developed by Infinite Interactive and published by D3Publisher Of America Inc., Puzzle Quest: Galactrix is yet another puzzle roleplaying game in Infinites steadily growing stable of quality match 3 titles. The wonderful thing about this game, however, that sets it apart from the other Puzzle Quest titles is that this one does not take place in a fantasy setting. No dragons, no swords and no magic. Galactrix instead is set far into the future and deals with aliens, lasers and technology. You take on the role of a rogue M.R.I. pilot scouring the galaxy in your spaceship trying to uncover clues in an intergalactic mystery that will affect the fate of the entire universe.\n\nI'm happy to report that the addictive match 3 gameplay is back but with an all new redesigned puzzle battlefield as well. Gone are the circular gems of the fantasy based Puzzle Quest titles. They have been replaced by the more futuristic looking hexagonally shaped tiles and since this game takes place in space gravity will be a factor in how the tiles fall. If the match takes place in orbit around a planet, the tiles will always fall downward but if you are fighting in open space the tiles will come from whatever direction you made your previous move so strategy will also be a factor in how you battle. The puzzle play is the same as always, you try to match 3 or more colored tiles with each color representing a different aspect of your spacecraft such as weapons, shields, engineering, computer, psi and intel.\n\nCombat in this game takes place between spaceships. Your chosen vessel can be outfitted with a plethora of different equipment and armaments which are the equivalent of spells and bladed weapons in the fantasy based Puzzle Quest games. These items use gunnery, engineering, science and shield energy corresponding with the different colored tiles respectively. Make enough matches and build up the appropriate amounts of energy and you will be able to use that piece of equipment or weapon on your opponents ship. Take down your enemies shields and do enough damage to the hull and you will be victorious. Victories will earn you intel, which is the equivalent of experience points, which you can then use to upgrade the level of your character giving the player bonuses to different abilites. Another method of damaging your opponents vessel besides using your weapons is by matching the numbered tiles. These mine-like tiles have a different number 1-10 indicating the power of the damage output so matching higher numbers will be devastating to either you or your enemy. Throughout the course of the game, you will be able to salvage or buy a number of different ships each with it's own unique options and upgrade potentials. Some of the ships will blow your mind in both their design and specifications but they will not be easy to accquire. If you want a top of the line ship you'll have to save your credits, do a little haggling or get your hands on some unique schematics and just build your own. As I mentioned earlier, there is also a large abundance of equipment and weapons that you can accquire to further augment your warship such as laser turrets, shield generators, repair drones, etc.. For example shield inhibitors, which are my personal favorite, cause your opponents shields to stall out and not regenerate which leaves their hull completely open to attack. WWCPD...What Would Captian Picard Do? Depending on your playstyle you'll definitely find the right combination of technology to suit you if you buy it, loot it or craft it.\n\nThe story is quite compelling as it involves you solving a big mystery so you want to keep playing in order to see what pieces of the puzzle, no pun intended, you can put together and what questions you can answer. The graphics are top notch and this is definitely one of the more amazing looking match 3 games. Anyone who is a fan of science fiction will appreciate the beautiful handrawn art of the various alien species, unique worlds and especially the different makes and models of spaceships, weapon arrays and equipment showcased in this gorgeous game. The musical score is excellent filled with an abundance of surreal, jolly and haunting tracks which fit the titles futuristic theme perfectly. Sound effects are also quite superb. You'll love the combat sounds of the various weapons systems, the impact of the explosions and the sound of your system crashing when your opponent uses some kind of sabotage tech on your computer as well as a number of other terrific effects. Besides the combat puzzles there are also a variety of different puzzle types which involve hacking, mining, crafting, haggling and gathering rumors.\n\nPuzzle Quest: Galactrix is just so much fun and highly addictive. One gripe I do have about this title concerns gameplay. The game is completely random yet sometimes it seems as though your A.I. opponent receives and matches multiple damage tiles so many more times than you do to the point of sheer ridiculousness. I can't tell you how many times I've lost a battle because so many moves that I would make would yield nothing for me yet set the A.I. up for devastating damage against me time after time to the point of me rage quitting....oh it's so frustrating! With that said, this is still one of the best match 3 games I've had the pleasure of playing and I will continue to enjoy this title for years to come. If you've ever found yourself watching an episode of Star Trek or a similiar science fiction show and dreaming of commanding a spaceship in an epic battle then this game does a great job of delivering that experience to you. Puzzle Quest: Galactrix is highly recommended for any match 3, sci-fi or strategy gamer.","October 3, 2015","true","47.9"," 44 of 46 people (96%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","96","44","46","2","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cvanscythe/recommended/23500/","cvanscythe","Caine VanScythe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cvanscythe/","438 products in account","Don't let my short play time dissuade you from my review. I've been playing this game for about 2 years on my laptop. I just played a bit to make sure the Steam version works, and it does. Quite flawlessly, really. I've encountered none of the issues anyone else has, so far. I'm on a Win 7 64-bit laptop.\n\nThis game has lost none of it's charm, or it's difficulty. It plays simply enough. All you have to do is connect 3-or-more like colored tiles to gain the effect desired. During battle you can only move one tile per turn. The game seamlessly enters weapons and other tools you can use during battle as well. For example, you have a laser. This laser requires 5 red tiles to use. During the battle, you make enough red tile combos to get 5, and then you can use the laser. If you don't want to use it right away, that's fine. Every time you get a combo, these colored tiles are added to the ship's "battle inventory", and are stored for later use. There are tools to alter the gravity of the board, destroy specific tiles to gain their bonuses, affect your (or your enemy's) ship in some way, etc. To damage the enemy ship, you make a combo of the mines that are strewn about the board. Each mine has it's own number blinking on it, which is the amount of damage it causes. A combo of 3 level 5 mines will deal 15 damage, for example. You could get a combo of 7 level 10 mines (very hard to do), and deal massive damage in just one turn. Be aware that your enemy also uses these mines, and has their own weapons and tools. Don't worry though, as battles aren't timed. You will have all the time you need to study the board, and make a decision.\n\nYou can mine asteroids to gain materials to sell to any of the star bases, then use the profits to buy new ships, weapons, etc. Each asteroid has different materials on them, and each has an amount listed that you need to reach. If you reach these, you'll get a massive bonus to the resources you gain. Don't worry if you don't meet the requirement, you'll still get all the resources you mined. So it's always useful, and sometimes necessary, to mine during the game. Mining sequences are not timed, but have a limited amount of combos you can make, depending on the amount of tiles present on the board.\n\nThe most difficult, and extremely frustrating, point in the game... is the gate hacks. In order to get to different star systems, more asteroids to mine, and missions, you need to hack into an "star gate." This is not optional. In order to progress through the main story, this is required. Even if you don't want to explore. Each gate has a different difficulty. Every gate requires a certain amount of color combos to open it, and you have to do these in the shown sequence... and in the amount of time it gives you. The harder the difficulty of the gate, the more combos you have to make, and in less time available. Since the way the board works (once you get a combo, more tiles enter the board), you could easily get a string of combos and win within a few seconds. Or it'll give you a couple combos, and you can easily get confused as to why you aren't affecting the hack. You may think you need a purple tile, but the auto combos did it for you, but you didn't notice it. So you're entering purple combos to no effect. You can easily waste time this way, and tiles for future use. Unless you're a puzzle master, and love this much of a challenge, you are guaranteed to get frustrated.\n\nThis is an amazing game. I have never played a puzzle game quite like it. Everything it does, it does exceptionally well. The dialogue is great, the battles and mining are fun, the quests (though tedious at times) are well written and unique. The galaxy map is quite expansive, with plenty of systems to explore. There are multiple factions, each with their own feelings toward you, and your actions for or against them are reflected during the game. Each star base has different bonuses (positive and negative) for different resources, so if you care about getting the max bonus for each individual resource, you're going to be traveling a lot. I don't really worry about it, though. Most systems have a "shop" where you can buy everything you need. There's also a crafting system. Sometimes when you destroy ships, meet quest requirements, etc., you'll receive "plans." With these you can create new weapons and tools that were previously unavailable to buy, or make expensive items with cheap resources. Later on, you will have access to PSI abilities that allow you to "skip" battles (at the cost of PSI points) with certain ship classes. So if you have a massive battleship, you don't have to fight a lowly raider shuttle, if you don't want to.\n\nAs stated earlier, this game may or may not work for you. It has worked just fine for me. But I highly recommend this game to everyone who enjoys a good puzzle board, or space ship battles, or both. This is a great game.","January 13, 2014","true","6.4"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","17","19","0","0"

They mixed up the formula and it doesn't have that same addiction factor as before. The gem movement takes some getting used to, but it does lead to more strategic gameplay like being able to prevent certain moves your opponent can make on their next turn. The different systems don't provide any heads up display information so you can't get an idea what is in the system before you visit. And the minimap doesn't even provide system names making it pretty useless. The game also crashes way too much, and each time it does I get discouraged from playing further. Nevertheless, it's still a decent RPG match 3 adventure, just a bit of a disappointment considering the other Puzzle Quest titles were so much better.","February 6, 2014","true","14.7"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

Except that you need to have a turn to use it, and all other status ailments I've encountered are incredibly petty debuffs like slightly decreasing energy collected every turn, making this power, like many, many others, totally worthless.\n- The combat system itself is some of the most anger-inducing, pure luck based BS that's ever had the audacity to call itself a "Puzzle". You can have an enemy at 10 health after a half hour of matching blocks around (if it doesn't take that long for ever fight, it sure FEELS like it does, because the only blocks that cause damage are super rare and only about half of the other blocks are kind of helpful at all for either side) and then when they take their turn, mines slide in in a deluge by pure bad luck and one shot you from practically full health. Yeah, there was a lot you could do to prevent that.\n- Speaking of combat, there is next to no penalty for losing, and just some piddly experience for winning, which feels downright insulting with how long and frustrating battles are.\n- And the fun doesn't end there. Exploring the universe is incredibly slow, due to the fact that the game pauses to save (really, you have to make me wait in what's basically a pretty menu when most modern action games could save while I'm in the middle of an intense throwdown) ALL THE TIME. And the galaxy is huge, much bigger than it needs to be for all the content there is to "enjoy". Why are there missions where I'm flying through a smattering of planets, scanning them one at a time to find out where my objective ISN'T, until I finally get a lucky guess or there's only one place left to look? WHY DO THEY DO THIS MULTIPLE TIMES!? You will feel like the developers are intentionally trying to waste your time because apparently they think a good game is one that takes the most time to complete.\n- Despite being a casual game, a surprising amount goes unexplained. I blew up one ship that I salvaged Contraband from, a high-value cargo. Unfortunately, every ship in the system now magically knew that I was a filthy drug-runner, and attacked me. Would have been nice to know that would happen! What would have been even more useful knowledge would be knowing that by fighting back, I would ♥♥♥♥ off a huge swath of the galaxy, so that even after unloading the contraband, I get attacked every freaking system I travel into, causing travel between missions to take HOURS, unless you intentionally lose every single battle that comes your way.\n- Speaking of missions, these make Skyrim's fetch quests and Draugr hunts look like the works of Shakespeare. Search random planets for thing. Fight thing. Win. Or mine 20 Dragon Dildoes and 10 Mountain Dew Cases. Or, my personal favorite (and there are a LOT of these); go to X, Y, and Z and come back. Yes, half of the side quests are fetch quests where you're not even fetching something. Just go to place and come back. No fight, no minigame, not even any dialogue.\n- The music is bad, and it doesn't even flow together well. I swear, the battle music loops once, and then goes back to the AMAZINGLY dull space exploring music for the other 25 minutes of the fight. Absolutely inexcusable.\nIn short, this game is bad. I wouldn't pay 99 cents for this piece of digital trash. I wouldn't pay ten cents. I wouldn't let the developers pay me to play it, I'm dead ♥♥♥♥ing serious. I wouldn't give this to a poor ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ child if playing it would make his mom finally love him, it wouldn't be worth it for the poor kid. I wouldn't finish one more mission if every girl from Game of Thrones would be standing naked behind me the moment I did. If this game were around in World War 2, Hitler wouldn't allow Jews to play it because it wouldn't feel morally sound. If Puzzle Quest: Galactrix were a perfectly marbled T-Bone steak, dogs that eat their own feces wouldn't even be able to handle its smell without vomiting. This game's release was one of the final signs of the coming of the End of Times, milennia of madness and horror with no end in sight for the tortured remains of humankind. It's an insult to all things fun, a long, brown, smelly skidmark on the underpants of humanity. It sucks, it blows, it's a piece of ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥ garbage from a medical waste dumpster reserved for pus-oozing rotten scrotums and boil-ridden ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, and I for one do not much care for it.","January 21, 2014","false","9.2"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","62","8","13","2","5"

Puzzle Quest Galactrix. I have just finished it and it is partially true what they say about the crashes. I guess it will depend on what system you play will depend on how frequent it crashes but it only crashed a half dozen times for me in 32 hours of playing it.\n\nForget the crashes for a minute.\nStory is pretty poor for the most part. I felt one of the strong points to the original Puzzle Quest was its story. This time, it has one twist about 1/8 of the way through and then you meet Beta Prime about half way through. The story does get better at the end but it's a long time to wait between the three major things to happen.                You could only upgrade your character to level 50 and it didn't feel like it ever really contributed to anything. It did to begin with but after level 20 or so, none of it really mattered. The only thing that mattered was the ship I control.                The game play is different from the rest of the series and this put off a lot of people. Those people are delicate flowers who hate change because it didn't take very long to understand how the hexagonal blocks work and once you understood it, the game was fun.                You could only upgrade your character to level 50 and it didn't feel like it ever really contributed to anything. It did to begin with but after level 20 or so, none of it really mattered. The only thing that mattered was the ship I control.                There are TONNES of moves. Unfortunately you don't really need to experiment much to find out which ones are the most effective. I tested a total of 10 moves and found which 4 worked for me. That's all I needed by the way - 4 moves. One move that destroys all blue tiles on the board, one move that puts the enemy in a time warp and skips a few turns, Bole Mines and one move that destroys all of a colour of your choice and lets you keep all of the outcome.                You have the choice of ships is pretty good. You have 8 or 9 and I collected the 3 that were practically handed to me during the story and while I could purchase or build others I didn't need any of them.                The different types of puzzle you have is quite good. You have the regular attacks against enemies puzzle, rumors puzzle, timegate puzzle and mine puzzle which were all subtly different and the variety was really good.                The map is really massive but it was never really used to its full potential. There were plenty of missions but there were whole solar systems where I would have a whole bunch of missions in and then at least one half of the map had 0 missions. Some solar systems were there purely to have one mission where I hacked the timegate and click on a planet to deliver something. Maybe fight one enemy at most. It really felt like the developers had huge ideas to go with this but run out of time/money.                Sound was really good but it felt like that was what was causing all the crashes. It did start to feel a little repetitive by the end, though. But the sense of grandeur was not missing in the soundtrack.                I really enjoyed the moving backgrounds. It wasn't overwhelming or pulled focus from the gameplay or anything but was just nice to look at. The graphics of each Solar System was very simple but I enjoyed it a lot and made it immersive.","September 30, 2015","true","32.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Leapgate hacking is quite strange. Cascading just takes time in many cases, making it more difficult to hack instead of easier.\nAlso on mining, 'specials' hardly seem to have any benefits, and just empty the board, making it hard to complete the goal, where it should give bonus multipliers and bonus items on the board.\nIt seems to have craftables which would be a very nice feature, but thusfar I did not find usage for it (and after the crashes I probably never will.)\n\nIt could have been a very nice variation on earlier Puzzle Quests, but I have to say I don't like it thusfar, and after the bugs I don't have any reason to see if that will change.","January 13, 2014","false","0.9"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","0"

CotW took your standard match-three fare and combined it brilliantly with an RPG. You crafted items, went on quests, leveled up, and battled, all by utilizing a fun puzzle game to get things done. Galactrix tried to reinvent the gameplay, which is commendable. But it did a really, really bad job. Which is not so commendable.\n\nThe first thing you'll notice upon starting, is that there are no classes to choose from. Okay, that's fine. I wasn't expecting this to play exactly the same. Then you notice that all of the characters are kind of ugly. Oh well, it's the gameplay I'm after. Let's roll!\n\nThe game starts off with a boring narrative by a boring character talking about how great he is or something. I admit, I didn't really pay a lot of attention, here - it was boring! Soon enough you're on a map, and now you start to worry. This is a little ugly, too, you think. Not hideous. But it is a lot less visually appealing than the original Puzzle Quest.\n\nYou do some missions, and the map begins to bug you further. Your ship follows your mouse, and sometimes when you go to a place, a character speaks. And then the menu for the location doesn't come up, because you have to go to the planet again after the brief scene to ACTUALLY go to the planet. You realize this sometime around the point when your ship is on the other side of the map, nuzzling your mouse like it's ready to settle down and start a family. What are you doing over here, you ask. Why are you not at the planet I sent you to? The ship stays silent.\n\nSo you hack a gate. Okay, that was kind of alright. Not something I'd want to do a whole lot of, that's for sure. An hour later, you will look back on this moment as the one where your life began to fall apart. If only you could go back and warn your past self. But it's too late, the damage is done. You're now spending most of your time hacking jump gates. And you despise it. It wasn't even all that much fun the first time, and now it feels like an actual job. You feel the hatred boil with every gate. Every screw-up. Every time the game gives you none of a color, and then asks you to match it for every other match. Every time you lose because you only had to match one more color, but the penultimate match caused a 10x cascade that dribbled on at the speed of sorrow. You briefly consider becoming a super villain to exact your delicious, glorious revenge.\n\nAh, but here we go! A battle! This is what we've been waiting for! And it's fun. And you fight. And you enjoy it! Boy, it seems like the computer's just having things handed to them, though, doesn't it? No matter, it's probably just a fluke. A coincideOh hello, future self. What brings you here?\n\nSTOP. YOU MUST STOP, PAST ME. YOU ARE SO YOUNG AND NAIVE AND INNOCENT. STOP NOW. THE COMPUTER CHEATS. HEED MY WARNING.\n\nI wonder what that was about? Oh well. Hey, another battle! Oh no. Oh no, no, no. No, what have I done?\n\nPuzzle Quest never cheated this much. At least not until the late game, when they needed to implement a difficulty curve to keep things interesting and keep you on your toes! How could the game cheat so bad, so\n\nOh, hang on. The game crashed. Guess I'll reboot it. And I'll just get back to that battle... Okay, here we go.\n\nHow could the game cheat so bad, so early on? It isn't fair, I tell you! No, maybe I'm just ill-equipped for battle. I should upgrade. But where?\n\nAnd that's when you enter the final layer of Hell: lack of guidance. You can hack any gate and go wherever you please, right from almost the beginning. Side quests are available in nearby systems, and send you several systems outside of your hacked network. Soon you have half of the galaxy opened, and you don't know where to hang out. Where do I shop? Which places are best for me at my current level? Why can't I find any plans? Should I be mining things now, or waiting until I need materials? Should I ignore side quests until the story sends me to further parts of the galaxy? Is there an easier way to gain Psi points? What am I doing with my life? WHAT AM I DOING WITH MY LIFE? And you don't stop playing, because maybe. Maybe it gets better around the corner. It doesn't. But maybe. Please?\n\nThe gravity mechanic is pretty cool, though.","February 1, 2014","false","5.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The previous puzzle quest games were well done, fun to play and a decent challenge without feeling cheap.  This time however they seem to have forgotten much of what worked.  The story is confusing, the various functions in the game are largely unexplained.  Your ship controls badly and always wants to wander to some part of the screen you don't want t to go based on a click you made on a notification window.  The match up timer takes forever which isn't a problem until you get to the timed puzzles, which will cause you to fail them repeatedly because the timer doesn't stop wile the matches are being made, letting you watch helplessly as you get a ten match long combo which doesn't include the match you need, was you watch the timer go by unable to stop it.  A simple change of setting might fix this, but other then graphics/sound there are no setting to change!  The help screen also offers no help.  Worst of all you can get stuck in a constant series of attacks, and for the first time in ages I was given the distinct impression that the AI was cheating, and blatantly.  The game crashes frequently as well, which makes it frustrating to play.  If you like puzzle quest games, buy this on sale only, but be prepared for frustration.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mokushiroku/recommended/23500/","mokushiroku","Moku","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mokushiroku/","694 products in account","This is -the- worst, most broken, luck-based, cheating game I have ever played in this genre. Probably of any game I've played. Read on, because I've got legitimate reasons as to why. (Skip to the end for the short of it)\n\nThis game isn't hard in the sense of 'challenging'. The AI is so broken that every single move you make WILL result in a positive outcome for the enemy. You connect three red-energy? Mines (the attack tiles) will spawn in from the side in the perfect location for the enemy to use on their turn. You match three mines? The enemy will use a healing skill and an attack skill in one turn.\n\nI am a big, big fan of the original Puzzle Quest and 100% it, but within the first half-hour of playing this game I knew it was nothing like the first. Instead of just a health bar (the hull), ships now also have shield that you must depleat before you can start attacking the hull, which are replenished by matching blue tiles alongside hull and shield healing skills, making every game a constant back-and-forth of damage and healing. As well as a damaging skill, all enemes seem to have a skill that destroys all blue titles (restore shields) and max all of their energies, allowing them to heal and attack as much as they like, based on the tiles on the board (they will always match mines when they can, of course).\n\nThe writing is cliche, the characters one-dimentional, the music repetative (I've not noticed more than one track), and the map is designed to take as much time as possible to traverse (each system requires you to hack the stargate between them, which is an aweful, timed minigame. Even when you can move freely through hacked gates, your ship pauses on each system on its path. Delivery side-quests force you to travel to opposite corners of the map just to click on a base and move on, and this is all within the first half-hour of the game).\n\nWhat does the game have in its favour? Well, the hexagonal grid is certainly a change from the standard Bejewelled-drop, though the way drops are effected is confusing and hard to predict, what with the biased tile spawning. The character art is stunningly rendered and the ships are designed nicely, which contrasts against the ugly, copy-paste-hue in-game environments. The game seems to think it's Freelancer, having faction trust, mining/trading/bartering, and rumor gathering, but this is just a thin layer of unimpressive gloss over a shallow and broken tile-matching game that will not let you win.\n\nI have somehow spent 4 hours playing this game as of now, and I'm maybe two misions into the story, post-tutorial (missions being a fight, basically). I would say I've probably fought about 8 enemies so far, and each battle has had a minimum of two losses, each taking up to 10 minutes. I've had more than one fight where the enemy, who always gets the first turn, will combo off my entire shield and half my health in that first turn. It is unplayable to the point that I've though "Oh, well this must be a scripted loss, I obviously don't stand a chance", only to be met with a 'retry' screen. There is no difficulty slider, and I can only imagine the enemy will get harder as the game progresses.\n\nIf you like to have fun, relax with a casual game, listen to nice music, feel a sense of accomplishment and generally have a positive experiance, don't buy this game. Go get yourself Bejewelled 2, or if you're looking for that RPG twist, get Puzzle Quest 1. By all means get Galactrix if you want to prove me wrong and I'm just bad at a good game, just make sure you tell me how that goes for you. I bought this game at a high discount, and it was still too much for this level of awefully designed mechanics.\n\nUPDATE: Having now given this game 8 hours of my life, I'm finally uninstalling and hiding it in my 'Unwanted' folder. Since the original review I am no further with the story, repeatedly losing every encounter (with all points put into my shields, no less) and literally falling asleep as I play. This game is so broken as to be unplayable, and the only game I have ever played that I beleive would legitimately put me into a coma.\n\nDO. NOT. BUY. THIS.

I'm not far in the plot yet, but there are a few factions to choose from and a few twists, keeping in mind that it's a puzzle game first, not a proper RPG.","January 22, 2014","true","27.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

However, there is far too much randomness since combos result in gems from off the screen coming into the playing field.  It makes strategy not be nearly as important as it ought to be.  Too some extent this is really just a game of chance.  Add in the crashes every hour or two on Windows 7, and it makes for an exceedingly annoying game sometimes.  The lack of information when you start about being attacked by every ship if you loot contraband off of a pirate can really screw up your game also.","March 14, 2014","false","25.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The in game tutorial covers little and does not explain the use of coloured gems in this version. Certain 'easy' tasks took over twenty attempts for me on occassion and only one on another, so the natural variance in the difficulty of gem patterns can be considered random. Given a full understanding of the game and a deeper progress into the game it might play better but the learning curve is too steep. I don't think this game "cheats" as much as other PQ games (the sugested moves are still often to your detriment) but it is less forgiving. In timed tasks, it can be very frustrating to see the time continue to count down while the invitable cascade of gems occurs—which does nothing to help you other than chew up time; you think they would have paused this. Further expect this game to crash without warning.","January 16, 2014","false","5.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

After an issue with video drivers that caused the game to have a blank menu screen with swirling planet was corrected by updating the drivers, all I get are constant crashed. At least every 20-60 minutes and it destroys any fun the game gives.\n\nThe game itself is actually very good. A puzzle game with objectives is a very clever way to refresh the genre! You collect colored gems to refill your different colored energy levels in order to power your weapons, shields and other armaments. You have some attacks that don't use a turn, some remove all of one color gem, some destroy the opponents shield and another heals your life. There are too many to list.\n\nAside from the above mentioned battles, there are also hacking stages where you need to match a series of colors in a ceratin amount of time to hack the warp gate. There are also mining mini games and of course the overall story of the game. There are many galaxy's to explore and they're all interconnected with warp gates.\n\nYou can also take on black market missions and be persued by the good guys or you can attack other factions and be pursued by them when your standing among them drops too low.\n\nOverall, great game if you can handle playing between crashes!","January 19, 2014","false","5.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

And this game features a few variants of a pretty good puzzle. Unfortunately this is the only good thing I can say about this game. Everything else in this game is bad. And you can find dozens of similar puzzle games for free on Teh Net (flash ones) only without spaceships, space exploration, RPG elements and mining.\nNow, what I don't like in this game.\nFirst of all, it's SLOW. Every ship has SPEED parameter. The big ship is obviously slower than small ship. Which means that I have no reason whatsoever to aquire an expensive ship at all. Because even your default ship (that has 8/10 speed) is slow. And the ship turns even slower. Its frustrating. Big ships are MUCH slower. And that leads to another problem. The upgrade system of aquiring a new ship and equipping an array of gadgets turns out pointless. Small and fast ships carry only a few gadgets. So why bother with ships and gadgets if by using them you will make your gameplay so painfully slow? And if this choice makes the game too hard later, well ♥♥♥♥ this game.\nNext, leveling. You have 3 pools of colored gems that are used to power gadgets (red, green, yellow), purple pool for bypassing puzzles, grey pool of XP and finally blue pool that is your shield. Which is like your HP only it can be restored by matching blue gems. You get 5 skill points per level that you can use to boost one of 3 power colors or your shield. By doing this you raise the max capacity of said color, starting amount and speed of gaining it by matching gems. So obviously you dump all your skill points into shield until it stops to grow. Then you dump them into three others equally. That's all.\nNext, XP gain. You gain it by matching grey gems. That's it. The rewards for quests, hacking and everything else does not make an impact. I was attacked by a pirate in quaris system that had a gadget that restored his shield completely. I fought him for 15 min. I gained more than 5000 XP. What. That was too easy.\nMovement. You fly after your cursor. You finished your buisness on the planet (shopping, getting mission, finishing mission, reviewing your inventory) - you already flew away from the planet. If you need to do something else on the planet you need to turn around, which is SLOW. In case of missions of the main quest - next one is given to you on the same planet you finished previous. Which means that you will need to do this turn-around quite often to finish the game. It gets tedious very fast.\nGrafics. I saw better grafics in browser flash games. Yes I'm going there. Only puzzles are relatively well done. The space is a static picture which rarely differs from sistem to system. And its ugly. I saw a LOT of much better wallpapers of starry space. The planets, asteroids, gates and stations stand out like a sore thumb. They simply do not belong. Again, ugly. Ships are ugly too. Though I may not be entirely fair in this. I constantly compared grafics of this game's space and spaceships to the ones in Space Rangers (first part). And those were made by a really good artist.\nSaving. Every time you do ANYTHING that changes your stats the game saves. Which slows it even more. Why not make it save every time you leave a system and give us an option to save by ourselves?\n\nWell that's enough. Vented my frustration and deleted the game. Good thing I bought it on 90% sale, bad thing I bought it at all.","February 11, 2014","false","4.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I didn't get too far into it. They all play the same way, you group three, pieces slide around, you group another three until you finish. The first type is the "battle" puzzles where you and an opponent take turns either grouping three or using a weapon but the random nature takes a lot of the fun out of these. I did pretty well with only a couple retrys but when I won, it was completely random. I would group three bombs, the pieces would slide into a combo, more bombs would appear on the board, they would slide into a combo, and I would win. No skill here, just randomness. Oh, and making a wrong move (IE: Moving pieces that don't make a group of three) results in taking ship damage. So you're punished for making mistakes.\n\nThen there are the hacking puzzles. These are extremely tedious and nearly every star system has 2 star gates to hack and it becomes old fast. The hacking puzzles differ by being timed and having to group specific colors in a specific order (yellow, than red, than blue, than yellow again, etc). It is extremely frustrating because what color pieces are moved onto the board everytime you clear any is random and there are times where you spend 15 seconds just grouping random colors to get the ones you need to show up. You can group clocks to get 10 additional seconds but adding a few more seconds doesn't make these any more enjoyable.\n\nThe other two types are mining and crafting. Its the same group three. You "mine" for materials by grouping three or more until you have no moves left. No complaints but you don't get to choose what you keep if you mine too much. It'll even what you mine and you'll have to sell to make room.  You can use those minerials to "craft" which is another group three puzzle.\n\nAfter a little over three hours and about 30 puzzles, I wasn't having fun.  Game also crashed four times during those two hours.","January 20, 2014","false","6.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

No classes or unique abilities like in the original game, but at least it still has the same ridiculously addictive gameplay where the CPU hates you. It's your character, your crew, and a ship that you maneuver through the Universe. However, without a guide, you're constantly lost.\n\nIf you're new to Puzzle Quest, this is definitely not beginner-friendly. The way the Hexagonal grid is played can be a bit confusing since it moves in the direction you move the gems towards. Definitely give the older titles a try, since it's more like the classic "Bejeweled" style, plus there's unique RPG elements in there. Well-- there's RPG elements here, but it's just not as diverse and dynamic as the older titles.\n\nReturning fans should skip this unless you want a bit of a challenge. Pray to RNGsus when you do. I tell ya, crafting is ridiculous.","November 7, 2014","false","17.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I admit, the enemy pretty much owned me at first, but, understandably, I accepted all my failures, because the board layout completely differs from original PQ series, so it takes time to learn the predictable patterns for falling tiles (truly, as the story take place in zero-gravity space, new tiles can be falling from all directions, not just from up-to-down)\nSo, once you figure out how the board works - the enemies would become no problem. And learning new puzzle mechanics is always fair and interesting challenge.\n\nSpeaking of the space setting: that's another thing you can easily praise "PQ: Galactrix" for. They have successfully managed to rework the whole mechanics of the original game and blend in the usual space fiction tropes with new gameplay features (say, for example, aforementioned zero-gravity battle grid with tiles falling from all directions or the mandatory for space games mining business, that was combined here with useful weapon crafting or selling the extracted minerals to the star systems, willing to pay the best price per ton.. Or selling the cargo cheaply to a hostile race to buy their loyalty)\n\nThe game atmosphere has heavily reminded me in many ways of "Space Rangers" - another game series I love very much.\nSurely, Galactrix is a nice spin-off and worth at least the summer sale price, which is what I bought it for and thoroughly enjoyed playing the game - I'd say, give it a shot.","May 26, 2014","true","1.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/KarasuG/recommended/23500/","KarasuG","Karasu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/KarasuG/","88 products in account","I find myself laughing at the sheer torrent of negative reviews I've found for this game, both here and everywhere else all over the Internet. Most of those can be written off as either "I don't know how to play, so it's a bad game" or "Nothing like the first Puzzle Quest game, so I don't like it". People who write reviews with those sentiments as their core points should not be allowed to write reviews.\n\nThe puzzle board is a refreshing change to the standard "match 3+ of a color" formula. Six directions allows for so many possibilities to surprise an enemy with a strange combo.\n\nCombat is well-crafted and challenging, and there is always a way to win if you're willing to look for it, whether through a suddenly-favorable board configuration or a way to exploit the enemy's resources so they can't use their items while maximizing use of your own.\n\nHacking LeapGates does not deserve the massive level of criticism I've seen it get; it's a straightforward puzzle, with a simple goal. Yes, you have to hack every gate you want to pass through, but since people seem to think this is tedious, there's always an option to use your PSI points to open the gate automatically - and you're never going to run out of those unless you're reckless, or you use them to dodge every battle.\n\nHaggling for discounts is small and motivating; you always want to do well. It's a minor annoyance that you have to do it for each item you want to buy or sell, but it only makes a real difference for the more expensive purchases like ships, so it's not a concern for the smaller items.\n\nRumor puzzles are well-designed, but serve little purpose other than as collectibles and experience. I do wish they would've played a larger role, because the puzzles are better than what they're used for.\n\nThe faction system is expansive and logical. If you make someone hate you, they'll make sure you don't pass through their worlds without a fight. I see little basis for the near-universal criticism of the game's characters, since the situation the universe is in pretty much justifies the near-total pessimism. And the fun part: it's entirely possible to become allies with literally every faction, except for the story's main antagonist - even the pirates.\n\nI'd never heard of the Puzzle Quest series when I found this game. I'm a huge fan of puzzle games overall, and the RPG elements are a very welcome bonus. The negative reviews actually helped convince me to buy it, since it just seemed absurd that people would hate the game for things that have nothing to do with the actual gameplay. I did get it on a 90% sale, but that doesn't change anything. Galactrix is a beautiful, well-designed game.","January 19, 2014","true","14.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You can get items for your ship that change this general rule, but I found myself getting burned more than a few times by 'incidental' mine matches during an enemy's turn. I swear, this series of games cheats more against the player than Mario in Mario's Game Gallery during a round of Go Fish. ***","December 9, 2014","false","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The list can go on and on. But Galactrix is a game I really tried to like, I mean I loved Puzzle Quest. This game makes you hate it, and you get the feeling the game hates you right back. I don't mind when I lose but this game takes randomly played moves to a whole new level of "dude... wtf...?". It seems they took the core idea of "Puzzle Quest" and put a space like spin on it. But so much of the magic is left out and it feels... well hollow. You'll spend most of your time hacking gates, mining and fighting your way threw a web of systems that feel generic and plane. The AI is like all Puzzle Quest games, unforgiving to the point where you get the feeling it hates you and your babies.\n\nHere are a few examples of this games logic, just so you know I am being fair.\n\n1. Hacking a gate is a time trial, so you need to match the colors as quickly as you can. Sometimes you'll combo, and you'll start a cycle that just wont stop. This eats your time up and yes you'll combo into the color you need, it dose not happen that often. In fact it is really rare, but none the less you'll lose to the combo cycle and you'll have to start all over again.\n\n2. Combat is like Puzzle Quest, in fact it's pretty much the same only everything is lasers and shields. One fight I entered, I didn't even get a single move and the AI made a combo that... with just one move. BOOM! I was dead, he combo-ed into a 203 damage play. I know it seems like I am whining but come on. I didn't even get to make a move, not one single move.\n\n3. When you are on the mini map, or over world map. You'll sometimes get picked up by people who hate you, so you'll have to either fight the ship or run. I know it dose not seem bad to deal with, but you can get trapped into a cycle that just wont stop. Yes, you can fight but their ships are harder and a little op for just patrol duty. So you'll get picked up again, run picked up again.\n\nPro – I like mining in this game, it's fun and relaxing. Some of the names of the systems are nods to popular space fairing games. Really, I can't think of anything else.\n\nCon – On top of my top 3 list, the music is bland, the AI hates you, and your family, your families families and every girl you ever kissed plus your mom. The story is really boring and dull. Hacking gates is an over used mini game that is just not fun to play. Enemy ships are always more powerful and better skill then you. Lastly... just random crap that like all Puzzle Quest games, happen for no logical reason.\n\nVerdict – I think the developer had a secret hatred for Puzzle Quest and wanted to get revenge on everyone. If you honestly don't mind everything I had a problem with it, then by all means... pick it up. But I think next time they come out with a Puzzle Quest game, I'll wait on it.","August 21, 2014","false","17.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Once you find a good balance of skills, you'll almost never need to change your strategy. Regardless of strategy, though, the opponents seem to have preternatural luck, and many times you'll win either by reloading or just saying "♥♥♥♥ it" and trying to set off lucky chain-reaction matches. I never really felt chuffed about outwitting the game's enemies like I did in the previous two games. Oh well.\nIt's still fun and addictive, and the hexagonal system makes calculating chain-matches satisfyingly tricky, especially when gravity-altering skills are in play.\nThere's a forgettable "faction loyalty" system that you can game by selling piles of commodities in areas you want to like you.\nControlling your ship via cursor is super clumsy; good luck trying to evade enemy ships with any degree of skill, because skill isn't a factor.\n\nMinigames are tepid compared to PQ1, consisting of a strategic match-as-many-as-you-can-before-tiles-run-out game (mining), a speed-matching game (gate unlocking), and a game where you try to avoid setting off "bombs" by conservatively avoiding chain matches (information gathering), and a crafting game where you have to match certain quotas (which I didn't play much, because crafting is almost entirely unnecessary). The gate-unlocking game is annoying, especially given how many times you'll have to do it; the other two that I played are mildly fun.\n\nSTORY: The frame story is boilerplate junk full of minor textual errors, but that's par for the Puzzle Quest course.\n\nGRAPHICS: Pleasant, though unsophisticated. Nicer than PQ1; not quite as nice as PQ2.\n\nSOUND: Music is pretty good and a pleasant listen. SFX are fine.\n\nMULTIPLAYER: None.\n\nOTHER NOTES: PQ: G is surprisingly taxing on system resources for such a lo-fi game.\n\nRECOMMENDED? YES if you liked the other Puzzle Quest games, are a fan of puzzle-match games, want a good time-waster game and haven't played the other two PQs (the Marvel one's an F2P scam and doesn't count), and/or aren't hard to please.\nNO if puzzle games aren't your style, or if you're a snob for quality.","May 30, 2014","true","42.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Some of the mini-games (for example, mining) are fun, and it's enjoyable to play it as a little space economy simulator, flying around systems to find the place that will pay the most for isotopes or technology or what have you. Unfortunately the combat, which is essential to advance the plot, is much worse than in either of the 2 'traditional' puzzle quest games. Both sides have shields which are recharged by matching blue hexes, and the hit points are higher so it becomes much more of a slog to do a significant amount of damage. Except, of course, that once you cascade 4 or 5 chains in a row you go 'nova' and then 'supernova', which doubles the value of matches, which means that lucking into a cascade like this can do 50 or 60 points of damage (about 4 hours into the game I was doing fights where both sides had around 90 hp and around 30 shields, and standard attacks were doing around 7 or 9). Combat then becomes a matter of trying to match shields and hold out long enough that you can luck in to crazy high damage cascades before the computer does. There are items that will let you do various other things in battle, but they're scattered around the systems which makes it a pain to try to find an upgraded laser or whatever. Just play puzzle quest 1 or 2 if you really need to scratch that match-3 itch.","March 22, 2014","false","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Maybe I felt like I was perpetually near the end, and how could I not?  A third of the way through my total play-time I had already maxed out my levels.  The end couldn't be much farther then, right?\n\nChrist, I was so wrong.  Just shy of 60 hours of fruitless grinding to a sad climax.  How sad?  Your character doesn't even meet the final boss face to face.  They don't even have ONE line of dialogue with one another.\n\nI'd complain about this game more but I don't want to devote any more of my lifetime to even thinking about this.

It is on this second play through that I realised that Galactrix isn't really a game - it is an elaborate machine of psychological torture, a machine which is lubricated by the tears of rage and frustration that will flow forth from you as you interact with it.\n\nThe sole drawback of this game is its gameplay mechanic - a "match 3" puzzle. Your success is only marginally determined by your skill - the reality is that luck will largely determine whether or not you progress through the game. And it is when the luck turns against you that the machine will extract its much needed lubricant from you.\n\nThe most annoying thing about this game is that its story and setting, while only sparsely fleshed out, was just enough for me to willingly strap myself into this torture device and subject myself to the pain of being ♥♥♥♥ed over by random number generators over and over again. Therefore I am recommending this game, but only to people with an abundance of spare time and unhealthy levels of self-loathing.

Bought the game, played about five battles and then it crashed. Couldn't even launch it successfully ever since. That is somewhat even more remarkable given the fact I've tried to do so on a variety of computers. This is literally a game I wanted to enjoy but it didn't want me to.","January 7","false","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Leveling up makes the game MORE difficult instead of less.\n\nThe concept is there to make a good game but the execution is flawed. Never had the crashing error but it seems to be prevalent based on other reviews. Maybe I'll go back and play it all the way through one day if I'm feeling ambitious.\n\n3/10 Would not recommend\n","October 13, 2015","false","4.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Might also turn of overlays.       Now game puzzles are all a bit similar, but I still enjoy them.   Bit of strategy and luck to determine which way to pull in new jems.   in Combat mines are critical and your better off sometime taking a minor hit in order to achieve a better retaliation next round.  Anticipating what your opponent will do helps a lot.   Then there is blind luck involved as well.     Anyway I enjoy the puzzles, it is a nice distraction.","April 30","true","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"
