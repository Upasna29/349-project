Every level is the same and you do the exact same thing. 5 weapons and that's about it. No online/local multiplayer. Very repetitive. Seems like it took about a week to make. None of the basics of the game are explained which is simply put "stupid". Took me about an hour to see all this game had to offer, which wasn't much. Also have to listen to your guy yell out the same 3 annoying lines every time he gets a kill, which is like 10 times per level. If i have to hear him say "yeah baby, thats what I'm talking bout" one more ♥♥♥♥ing time I will mail the developers of the game anthrax (not really though, I know you're watching CIA, I heard about Wiki-leaks). No story or actual campaign either. 5.5/10","December 3, 2014","false","1.3"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","15","19","0","0"

Boring and repetitive.\n3D graphics are very basic(it uses Unity3D engine) Controls are laggy. No online multiplayer and good luck finding someone to play this in split-screen.\nThis was an impulse buy which I already regret.","December 10, 2014","false","0.1"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

Its a fun game to just to let the time pass. The price is Decent for this game. So I suggest you buy it and try it! :3\n\nOne of the negatives in this game is that it doesn't have Online Multiplayer, if it did, I would play it 24/7 and recommend it to my friends. Now it DOES HAVE SPLITSCREEN Multiplayer, but thats it.\n\nI say buy it, hopefully the owners/makers of the game will add Online Multiplayer in the future, but for now I'll give it a 7/10","December 24, 2013","true","1.0"," 13 of 21 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","13","21","0","0"
