This will be a great gateway game to get some of my friends started in the genre. Easy rules but there's plenty going on under the hood to please old grognards. Keep up the fine work and keep that pricepoint where it is.\n\nWell worth $10.00 Cdn.","March 13","true","1.8"," 21 of 23 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","21","23","0","0"

I analyzed it in a detailed way for the purpose of a French review on Historia Games website ( http://www.histogames.com/HTML/test/assault-on-arnhem.php ). I found that the developer did a great job trying to simplify the game mechanisms without sacrificing too much of the historical context and realistic unit behaviour. Assault on Arnhem is easy to grab, it works fine and it provides an exciting challenge to green as well as experienced players. A substantial achievement from my point of vue. I want more of this kind of games!","March 16","true","0.2"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","15","16","0","0"

This is the same operation that the book and film A Bridge Too Far is about, and this little game reminds me of a paper-and-dice game published by SPI in their magazine Fire & Movement in the early 1980s.  So far the AI at medium has been fairly easy for me to defeat, playing both Axis and Allies, but this can be played with up to four people and several AI levels.  Very good playability, with the full campaign lasting 4-6 hours in single player mode.  I only wish the AI came in crazy aggressive mode because so far it has been a competent but sedate opponent.  Recommended.","March 13","true","10.6"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","14","15","0","0"

This is not working very well in comparison.\nFor example, I just played exactly the same scenario of Nijhelm as both allies and then axis, but each time the units for the enemy side were altered? Where the heck did they come from?\nThis doesn't seem historical to me, it is either accurate or it's not, which is it?\nThe other thing is I do not recall a limitation on how many units you can move, it was only limited by their movement allowance, another innacuracy compared to the boardgames, and also unrealistic to say the least.\nNot going to play anymore and will seek refund as this is not very well done at all.","April 3","false","7.1"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

The strategic mechanics, graphics and the gameplay are well done for this kind of game. The reason why i wouldn´t recommend it is simply missing content. The four scenarios use the same map and are rather short. Every scenario simply starts on another part of the map, as axis or allies. To look like a 80s boardgame is great, to have less content than one is not.","March 30","false","1.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"
