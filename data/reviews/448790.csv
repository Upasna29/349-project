Plays slow, non-responsive, repetative and simply boring.\n\nGame starts with shooting exactly the same astroids for a couple of minutes. I almost alt-f4 right then and there. However I read another review talking about a bossfight that would come after some timer in the top right corner elapsed. Fair enough some boring looking large ship emerged. Because of the length of the ship and the size of the boss shots its almost impossible to avoid some shots. But you cant tell that the shots hit you, only by looking at your health meter. After the boss more boring astroids came and another 3 minute timer... then its was alf-f4 time for real.","March 11","false","0.2"," 17 of 23 people (74%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","74","17","23","3","0"

It brings back memories of those old-school arcade games. Anyone likes this genre should absolutely give it a try!\n","March 12","true","5.9"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

While the game could use some instructions, it's mostly self-explanatory. The basics are very easy to learn and the early gameplay itself isn't too demanding for players new to the game and the genre, which allows them to learn the game fairly quickly. The game gets more challenging as you progress, but it retains the addictiveness and it leaves you wanting more.","March 17","true","4.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

In hangar we can see 2 ships (Scout and Grunt) with different stats (and there some mystery third ship, what will be available soon, as a free update I guess). Gameplay: first - you need destroy asteroids using various weapons for some time, you can see how much left in right top corner of screen; second - after time end, kill the boss. And about bugs: I found just one - you can't choice second ship using keyboard arrows, its just skip it. But with mouse all work good. Devs, fix it please. So Infinity Wings - Scout & Grunt is nice arcade game, what I can recommend.","March 13","true","2.7"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

I thought to scount and grunt would be my mission, but it's actually the names of the current playable ships, so that made me laugh. The horizontal shoot 'em up gameplay is quite standard and the graphics are pretty plain but somehow they're also pretty pretty, and I found myself clearing asteroids not just to avoid getting hit, but to see the pretty spacescapes. The in-game How to Play was kind of helpful, but it didn't mention that "Keypad #" referred to the controls on a gamepad. I had to look at the pre-launch setup option window you get with most Unity games to see what the control scheme was. After I knew what my keys are, I was enjoying a moderately difficult shoot 'em up with my large and slow moving Grunt ship. The weapon variety is nice and I like how you can use ALL FOUR WEAPONS AT ONCE instead of having to choose between one based on powerups you pick up. The bosses were pretty tough and the shots were fast. But I wonder if when the bosses keep firing missles during their death animations... was that intentional? 10/10, would buy for the kids again.","March 13","true","9.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","1"

I really enjoyed played because futuristic atmospheric remind me my childhood game days. Also the sound, the colours, interface, controls and grafics setting are friendly and great since my experience playing at. By his price looks fun for play hours.
