It's a tired concept for a puzzle game that you could find on pretty much any flash game site. The game constantly lags and is plagued with graphical glitches. As if that weren't enough, I couldn't beat the first level because the game crashes before I can get halfway through it. I see nothing good about this game. It wouldn't even keep a small child entertained because it crashes so frequently.\nEven if the developer fixed the awful glitches and crashes, the game still wouldn't be that fun, it's just too simplistic and easy, with no real substance.\n\nThis game wouldn't be worth the price if it were free, but $5? That's absolutely outrageous. I got this in a humble bundle or something, so I didn't pay anything for it, but I'm honestly ashamed to have this in my library.","November 14, 2015","false","0.1"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","91","10","11","2","4"

Visuals are primitive, engine works not so smooth, really nothing of interest here.\n\nИгра 3 в ряд с вывертом, корявая головоломка про вращение взаимно пересеченных колец с бусинками, которые надо соединить по цвету. Внешний вид примитивен, движок работает не столь уж плавно, действительно ничего интересного.","February 8","false","0.5"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/astring/recommended/394480/","astring","every bae is halloween","http://steamcommunity.com/id/astring/","4250 products in account","Kind of a shoddy match-3 game where you have to destroy X bubbles of each color per stage. This is just made dull by the glacial pace of movement, the fact that you have to figure out what "tracks" they move on with each board, and how it's pretty challenging to actually combo anything without a lot of tedious setup. It's not amazing. Sorry, devs.","October 23, 2015","false","0.1"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","9","16","0","0"

Reminds me somewhat of 10.000.000 but more charming an cuter. Can recommend it with a 7,5/10 score. The in-game sound track is annoying.\n\nI received a game for this game for free.","February 3","true","0.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I'm actually into match 3 games so I was a bit excited to try their twist on match 3 games. They have rings that you can move to create matches and the movement of the rings adds complexity into the puzzles.\n\nPositive:\n+ Innovative match 3 concept\n\nCons:\n- COST, when I found out they wanted $4.99 for this game I thought they were crazy. This is at best a $0.99 mobile game which should be free on steam.\n- Cheesy graphics and bad sound\n- There's not actually a story, and its very poor to call it one\n- Awkward matching, sometimes when you rotate a wheel, it doesn't register as a match unless its perfect, and the whole point of the game is to go fast\n\nTLDR:I honestly have nothing good to say about this game. I'm honestly ashamed to have this in my library.\n\n0/10","January 31","false","0.2"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","3","6","0","0"
