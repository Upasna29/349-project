It is challenging non-stop, engaging action with clever AI, hilarious game messages, heroically brutal demises, great weaponry/ defenses/ upgrades, and beautiful scene design for its time - some of the detail is really impressive. It is one of the best blends of tower defense, FPS and action gameplay in one game I've encountered.\n\nPropaganda radio FTW   9/10","October 31, 2014","true","11.4"," 24 of 26 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","24","26","0","0"

Shame a great game like Iron Grip with good potential didn't have a solid playerbase and AI improvements.\n\nEDIT: I tried playing multiplayer with a friend of mine, but it didn't go too well. The game has stability issues and ping jump from 50 to 200 all the time.\nI wish the devs would come back and make another Iron Grip, or just update this one.","April 21","false","6.8"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","14","15","0","2"

When looking into the game and reasearching it I knew what I was buying. The basic premise is to hold out a stronghold and kill the enemy commander enough times to make their moral go down. From a first glance the graphics are not amazing and the AI is, lets say it, mentally handicaped... severly. But that was the intention. It is best to play with a group of friends, not alone in a basement. The RTS feature of placing manned guns and traps is awesome and the adrenaline felt ingame is equally amazing. There is also a decent variaty of weapons. The game is only 8$ so don't complain if you don't like it.\n\nDo not buy this game if you are expecting this to be 100% Cod or Battlefield grade awesome.

Was a great time waster (turning on the xmas option made us both laugh til our stomachs hurt).\n\nFirst off this game is very not serious.  To make it plain as day, this game is almost like a cross between Quake 2 and TFC (engineer class only).  You earn money from shooshting (yes it's totally a word... Austin Powers 3 damnit!) bad guys who are trying to invade your... country?  You use that money to magically make yourself more and more like rambo... or instead building bunker style turrets that shoosht the badguys, kinda.\n\nPretty much most of the game you run around using rather stiff guns to blow appart baddies, most of which run the gambit almost like a weird tower defence.  Your towers you can build are pretty 'bleh' as they are easy to destroy and have terribly firing arcs.  Depending on the map you will have random objectives that will annoyingly take you away from defending the base, and in most cases will cause you to die, alot.\n\nBut, once you load the game up with a few friends it suddenly becomes a riot.  So if you plan to grab this game on a whim, grab a few more copies and share it with some friends.\n\nOtherwise the toy soldiers win.

The only problem is that it is very outdated. If only its developers stopped focusing on other failed projects and promoted this game properly, they'd get somewhere. This is a gem of a game, as what they did was they took tower defense, threw in some FPS, sprinkled some RTS, and wrapped the whole in a deep game world (the rest of the games have disappeared; there was Marauders and Lords of War... they all tied in with each other and you could even earn benefits between games).\n\nIn the end, if you've got some money to spare, buy this when it's on sale and just give it a single-player whirl. It's worth your time just to check it out for a few bucks. Otherwise, old maps and empty servers makes this co-op game not very co-op, unless you have a bunch of friends online with the game too.","January 11, 2015","true","69.4"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vmblood/recommended/31700/","vmblood","VolkmasterBlood","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vmblood/","222 products in account","One of the most interesting games I've played in awhile.  Firstly, this is an FPS.  Secondly, it is also a simple strategy game.  Thirdly, it is around 800 mb of space.\n\nBasically, you and your "rebels" fight off thousands of enemy imperial soldiers.  You must defend your rebel stronghold, while the enemy must kill it off.  The main game is in FPS mode.  Every player though, depending on how well they do, gains power.  With power you can buy traps, guns, bombs, support crates, turrets (both troop and vehicle), among other things.  The strategy mode isn't another main mode.  Rather every person has it with the press of a button.  You can still control your character's movement in this mode.  So if you want to plant a trap while running away from gunfire, you can do so.\n\nThe maps are set up so that attacks can come from any area, but you also have a good defense and each round is about 30 to 40 minutes of play.  You also have the option to repair anything, every character has molotovs, and every character has a knife, pistol, and rifle.  Buying weapons with "power" is what customizes your character.  Once you buy something in terms of weapons or bombs, you have it forever.  When you die, you respawn with those armaments.  Spawned turrets have unlimited ammo, and health that you can repair as well.\n\nIt is really fun to play this game.  It isn't graphically advanced, but it doesn't need to be.  A very simple strategy/fps game with a tower defense like mechanic, that doesn't involve any towers.","November 5, 2014","true","1.1"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

I assume you saw that it's an FPS/Tower Defense game. There's not a whole ton of these, so it's good to see another option. Iron Grip: Warlord is neither among the best FPSes nor the best TDs. In a number of ways it falls short. Sound design is nothing special. The sound and music isn't bad, but it's not memorable at all. However, the game has a cool aesthetic. The visuals aren't very unique or inspired, but at least seeing some airships and soldiers in suits of conquistador or gladiator armor and stuff like that strays from the norm and sets itself apart a bit.\n\nWhen it comes down to gameplay, I also have mixed feelings. It's tough and punishing, sometimes fun and sometimes bland. But at least it engages you. If you don't carefully plan, and then react on the fly (you get a bit of time before the first wave and then it's continuous), you will fail. The game allows you to rapidly switch between your FPS view (where you'll do all your combat) and your overhead build view (where you'll build one of a few buildings or traps), and it's kind of engrossing that the game doesn't give you any shortcuts around the map, or allow you to take breaks. The game plays at a rapid pace if you're on a small map. Enemies are good shots, and numerous. You need to choose your emplacements carefully, and your personal upgrades perhaps even more carefully. There's nothing worse than picking up a sniper rifle and shotgun and not being able to take down tanks, or any troops within long or close range. The build view is okay I suppose, it just takes a second to get used to. You'll understand if you try the game. My major complaint with building though is a slightly obvious one. There's not enough options. That really is dissapointing when you realize that there's essentially two towers-one for people, and one for vehicles- and two traps-one for people, and one for vehicles- and two assist buildings- a supply building, and a rebuild for your base. So it's very limited. You'll also find yourself counting on any member of your team to keep themselves upgraded and reinforced, because if a path even slightly starts to fall, you're screwed. Medium difficulty, is perhaps a little bit more than one might expect. You have to juggle a lot of problems at once. When it comes down to it, there's not a ton of enemy variety, but the ones that are in the game feel interesting enough(well except the cannonfodder), filling roles between being tanks, asassins, supports, and generally tough commanders.\n\nSo, in summary, the game is not going to blow you away by any measure. That said, for the price it's pretty fair. $8 for a decent co-op game isn't a bad deal, even if you only play a little bit. Just make sure you play co-op, as bots can't compare and very few people play online. 6/10","July 27, 2014","true","1.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Also, ignore those reviews from people with less than an hour played. In it's time, they were the best graphics around. And really, if you need good graphics for you to enjoy a game, that's pathetic. Addressing those who have played less than an hour: Obviously you do not understand the game at all. Reading your reviews, I see you have absolutely zero understanding as to how the game works. It's not a mistake that the enemies are blue and your team red. And really, who cares?\nANGRY RANT OVER\n\nSure, it's graphics aren't that great compared to modern times, but it's still a great game. I enjoy it both singleplayer and multiplayer, though multiplayer is obviously more fun. This is a game where you can try to beat it, or you can just go around through the tunnels on each map and collect resources, then build up a defense so the enemy can't destroy your stronghold (What you are protecting) and then just screw around. The enemies are large in number, but are very easy. One shot from your basic musket will almost always down them. Overall, it's pretty balanced and can at times provide for a hard gameplay. The different difficulty levels definitely can make it a challenge for even the most experienced of players. 9/10","November 1, 2014","true","37.0"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

FPS mode is simple enough to allow a focus on tactics and RTS mode is simplified enough to allow a player's skill to make a difference. Its upgrade system combines old-style models and weapons with modern weapons and structures that give it an intriguing steampunk-Russian sort of feel.\n\nPlayers become part of a resistance against a larger, invading force. Vastly outnumbered, they team up to defend strategic structures from various footsoldiers, tanks, and mechanical walkers while trying to hunt down enemy officers. There is a single resource ("power") that is generated through any act that's beneficial for the resistance. Though the game features an individual score system the actual match outcome is determined by a kind of team score, referred to as "morale". When one team loses morale entirely the match is over.

The graphics are completely outdated, but all in all I give this game a solid 9/10. It has fantastic coop and is really a fun game. I have oversaturated myself with the game.

The graphics often feel "zoomed out" making it hard to aim with many weapons. Although the devs have released some solid updates since launch (better grafix options, steam cheevos, etc.), there is a lack of diversity in maps. This plays out like Killing Floor but with defensive structures you can build. However, most of the maps have 2 main entry points to your base plus one underground/through buildings entrance in the back making the maps feel repetitive.\n\nIf you have some friends who are interested there's a 4 pack available. It's a nice diversion with friends but don't expect to spend more than 1-2 hours on it at a time because of frustrating technical shortcomings and boring maps.","September 30, 2011","false","5.6"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

The AI is relatively smart and each has their own personality on what they do, however they hardly ever build anything so you'll have to cover that front. They will repair it though if damaged. Overall the game matches are extremely fun alone, and even moreso with friends. There's a lot of strategy involved in where placements of turrets and AT-Turrets should be making every choice vital to the success or failure of the match. Losing a stronghold is not something to take lightly as it will likely end the game for you.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fandango89/recommended/31700/","fandango89","Apparently Kid","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fandango89/","599 products in account","Graphics are terrible, looks like it was from 2002 not 2008. Also, there is no campaign, just playing the 9 maps against AI. One reviewer was right, easy mode is too easy and medium jumps up way too much and is too hard alone. The game misses in both first person and building aspects. In first person, you buy a guy but run out of bullets right away and then there is no infinite ammo or picked up ammo. The upgrades you spend a ton on yourself seem to make almost no difference, making for a lackluster system. You have to rebuy the gun, which seems like a waste and poorly made. As for building. It is the worst part. There are basically 2 towers total and then some traps. You can upgrade towers but the lack of variety makes for each level to be the same. You start with barely any money and make so little in game and its over soo quickly you have enough time to build and upgrade like 2 towers. Also, the waves never stop and the guys come in giant packs, giving you no time to rest and build and upgrade towers. For no apparent reason in some unobstructed parts of the map you cannot build a tower but then a little bit up you can. Some of the levels are soo terribly done I couldnt even build an antitank tower in the lane because there were no spots to (huh?). Also, in building mode you are not looking over the battlefield but are still controlling your person top down. That means you have to move along the path and can get stuck in buildings like him. It also means you move slowly around the level and cant pan it because you cant move over buildings. Also while trying to build in the battlefield your guy can die, which doesn't make sense since its building mode and thats not how TD games work. In some levels it only shows one specific clear path in blue but apparently their will suddenly be more and you're screwed and can never catch up. The pathing makes no sense as each level has little houses and stuff they can run through so you blocking off a way seems to do nothing. The "eliminate the spy" part is also stupid as you look and never see anyone on the map that doesnt move and you have no way to figure out where he is. You cant just run into their wave and spot him so it makes no sense. The levels are pretty boring and with the same guns, enemies, towers, and upgrades, it gets repetitive right away. Finally, the "morale" is poorly done. I would fight them off for 20 min and their morale wouldn't change. Yes killing commanders helps, but they would randomly gain morale even though they were just starting a wave and I had wiped out their last one. Some levels last 5 min, others 30, but for no specific reason other than their morale moves differently for an inexplicable reason. Nice idea, but failed execution.","December 2, 2014","false","2.6"," 6 of 16 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","6","16","0","14"

The graphics seem to be a secondary thought to the gameplay, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it's not a good thing either. They're not so bad that you won't want to play, but you definitely won't be saying to yourself "Man this looks great!" The interface is also a little bit clunky, and you'll likely struggle until you get the hang of it.    Gameplay  8  A very unique combination of Tower Defense/FPS is what makes Iron Grip really stand out and shine. With several weapons to choose from, you have plenty of ways to cut down the onslaught of soldiers marching towards your base. The selection of buildings you can create for your base however, leave a little to be desired. Some more diversity would be welcome here. That being said, you are able to upgrade some of the buildings you create, to really start cutting down the enemy. Some maps come across brutally hard, others feel strangely easy. Be sure to use the alternate routes to get behind the enemy and wreack havoc!    Story  N/A  Aside from a generic background (x vs y), there isn't much to be seen here.    Multiplayer  8  Hours and hours of fun with your friends as you try out the different maps and strategies to figure out how to survive massive numbers of troops and tanks being thrown your way.    Replayability  7  Iron Grip: Warlord suffers a little bit in replayabilty due to the lack of diversity in the buildings you can create. However, this being tower defense, that is to be mostly expected. It could also do with a few more maps.  Regardless of these facts however, Iron Grip certainly beckons you back into the fray with your friends, with lots of ways to defend and arm yourselves.    Overall  7.5/10  Iron Grip: Warlord does not disappoint. If you are a Tower Defense fan, you don't want to miss this one. For those of you that aren't Tower Defense fans, don't worry, I'm not either and this game was still a blast for me. At times it can feel frustratingly difficult, but the feeling of victory after you've spent time trying to figure out how to defend yourself negates any frustration you'll face on the way there.\nIf you liked this review, feel free to check out my curator page:\nThe Tipster\n\nYou are also welcome to join our group and play/discuss games together, here:  The Tipster","October 26, 2014","true","4.8"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

I think that's a good description for this game. You basically build towers, enemies will come and then it's your job to hold them off. You can switch between bird eye's view and first person. So the bird eye's view is for building the towers, the first person view is for actively killing enemies (alone or in co-op). It's a decent game, but it's very buggy and unpolished. Plus, there's no eye candy to be found here; the game uses, if I recall correctly, the first Unreal Tournament engine. It's an original idea though, but an idea is unfortunately not enough these days...\n\n[Rating: 62/100]","July 9, 2011","false","2.0"," 1 of 7 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","1","7","0","0"

The game consist of defending a single building from ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of soldier waves with tanks and mortar-hauling walkers, and forces you to either explore the whole city for possible secret paths to enemy hq or just running straight thru all the enemies to find a single officer, who can instantly kill you with a magical sword. The AI is bad, the games are boring and take around 30 minutes to finish with only progression happening in your self-improvement and enemy numbers.\n\nThe game looks visually good for a 2008 indie game, and feels a lot like first-person Dawn of War with it endless mass carnage.

It's a combination of RTS and FPS gameplay (somewhat like the Sanctum series), with a gritty, almost steam-punk like feeling to it. There's plenty of weapon variety, and the game doesn't really artificially limit you in terms of what weapons you can use or have at any moment. The enemies come in vast waves, and sometimes include large, hard to destroy vehicles. The maps are all pretty well thought out and sometimes quite challenging.\n\nThe RTS aspect is somewhat akin to tower defense - you build fixed structures, and they employ either an attack (like a machine gun or anti-tank unit) or else are triggerable (mines, exploding barrels) or otherwise help your troops (by healing them or refilling their ammo). The main limitation is that you can only put them on flat ground, and there's a point-cost for each item you place.\n\nThe FPS aspect is more or less horde-defense. You deal with enemies in any of a variety of ways (ranging from mowing them down with machineguns to setting off explosive barrels to using a flamethrower or what have you). The FPS gameplay's not inspired, but it's definitely challenging at times, and can be very situation-oriented.\n\nAll told i recommend it because it's a good synergy between two different types of gameplay, and seems to have a lot of replayability to it. My only wish is that it had more maps.","June 19, 2014","true","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You rn around the battlefield constructing defences to protect your base while gunning down the enemy waves with the AI or a number of friends.\n\nWhile the enemy AI is foolish and quite hapy to just walk over clearly visible traps this is expected as they are acting just as enemy waves do in a normal tower defence game. Though some will occasionally break off from the rest just to suprise you.\n\nAlly AI is not fantastic but it doesn't get in the way and this game IS meant to be played with friends as opposed to computer AI.\n\nThere is a story but it really just exists to segway between maps and bears no real significance. Thankfully the game doesn't really need a story so the fact there is one is a bonus.\n\nI give this game a seal of approval (^_^) 9/10","December 1, 2010","true","14.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

FPS/RTS hybrid with unreal tournament like... shooting/feeling while the rts portion is like a tower defence game.  The Single Player is the same as the MP except your AI allies are humans.

Tower Defense. RTS. FPS. Co-op.\nDid I just blow your mind?\n\nThis game is rough around the edges, (not super modern graphics, for instance, and the game is still in the process of being balances as of Nov 2010), but it's a LOT of fun.\n\nYou're defending a ramshackle rebel base from the bourgeouis imperialists, and you need power to do it. You collect power by shooting the bad people, or collecting gold (don't ask questions), and you use that power in several ways:\n\nYou can unlock/upgrade weapons for personal use, from machine guns to sniper rifles to mines, you can upgrade your character's health/speed/attributes, or very uniquely, you can enter a top-down RTS view and build/upgrade defensive structures like MG nests, fuel bombs, and supply depots.\n\nI don't think you can exclusively play in either mode, so a wee bit of FPS and RTS knowledge is good, but even better you can play with up to 8 friends cooperatively, and it is quite a ride.\n\nI'd recommend buying at ~5$.","November 26, 2010","true","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/recspecs/recommended/31700/","recspecs","RecSpecs","http://steamcommunity.com/id/recspecs/","45 products in account","One of the great indie titles that I've purchased from Steam. I remembered Iron Grip: The Oppression, an awesome mod back in the day for Half Life 2. It was one of the coolest games and amongst the early innovators of RTS-FPS integration but nobody seemed to play it, so it died out. The developers seemed to have learned alot from that project because this game is SO MUCH GOD DAMN FUN.  I haven't even played with anyone else yet, however I was having a blast just shooting with with the bots.\n\nUnlike Savage, Nuclear Dawn, and others, Iron Grip intergrates its RTS-FPS uniquely. You can seamlessly go from FPS to RTS while playing, and it's far more basic in terms of resource-gathering and unit building. (You're just building turrets and health stations pretty much, nothing fancy) To be honest, I may prefer this setup especially now that most of these kinds of titles are dying out in popularity with the exception of Savage 2 and the NS series.\n\nSo while the community may be sparse, possibly non-existent, it's still an extremely fun game. And I DEFINITELY recommend playing this with friends.","February 7","true","4.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
