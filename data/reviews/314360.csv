"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BrunoAssis/recommended/314360/","BrunoAssis","pZ!","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BrunoAssis/","481 products in account","A terrific 2.5D platformer with gorgeous graphics, amazing soundtrack and better playability than most platformers these days.\nIf you ever felt, like me, that the new Donkey Kong games are ALL set on ice platforms ALL the time, Aritana got your back, with a movement and maneuverability as precise as in the good old times.\n\nIt starts pretty easy but becomes increasingly challenging from the third level onwards, where its mechanics of timed attacks start to resemble a puzzle-platformer and really begin to shine.\n\nI've played it when it first launched in Splitplay, but now, with Steam achievements and trading cards, I'll certainly do it again!\n\nWith an innovative theme and clever mechanics, this game is a breath of fresh air in a genre that seems so stalled sometimes. Highly recommended ;)","August 11, 2014","true","0.2"," 44 of 59 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","44","59","0","8"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MakoSipper/recommended/314360/","MakoSipper","MakoSipper","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MakoSipper/","3805 products in account","Short Verdict: Aritana is a platformer with some puzzle elements about a Brazilian indian who's looking for the harpy's feather so the shaman can ban the spirit that possessed the tribe chief. The main aspect in its mechanics, apart from being a platformer that reminded me of the good ol' Donkey Kong games, is that you are always changing between Attack and Speed stances. The game is fresh, beautiful, and makes me really glad to know that there is at least one great indie game company in Brazil that can achieve this high quality. Kudos to DUAIK!\n\nPros:\nVery unique, heart-warming theme\nThe two stances are really well implemented and makes the game really fresh\nIt's not a brainless platformer--you have to think about what you're doing and just rushing will probably get you killed more often\nThey've really hit the spot on difficulty. It's not an easy game and you'll die a lot, but it's not one of those "let's see how to make this even more cruel" games. You'll die quite a few times and you'll learn as you try. Soon enough, you'll overcome the challenge by yourself and feel a great sense of accomplishment.\nCollectibles in each level (5 amulets called Muiraquitãs and 1 new combo) that add to the exploring experience\nTotal of 9 well thought-out levels, plus 3 smart boss fights, which is content enough for an indie game (but Tupã knows I longed for more)\nControls are customizable, although I think the idea of attacking with the right analog stick fits perfectly in the game\nThe cartoonish graphics are really beautiful\nBGM and SFX are also very nice\nCons:\nCombos seemed like a hidden feature to me. After you got them, there's no way to know which ones you've collected so far until after you beat the game. So if you forgot the sequence and moved on to the next level, there's no way of knowing. Also, the second and third combos I've unlocked (and I think there are other examples of this) could only be used after I got more basic attacks. Until then, I had already forgotten what the combo sequence was.\nI would've really appreciate to be able to replay levels before I beat the game, in case I missed something. That level selection screen should've been available since the beginning, actually, and it would also have solved the not knowing the combo sequence problem.\nTo sum it all up, the start menu itself could have info on unlocked moves, combos, stage completion (if combo and amulets were found)\nBought on: Steam Auction for 1470 gems. Paying that much was a bargain! It's currently 33% OFF on Steam and I think this might be a good chance. Download the Demo if you're in doubt.","December 21, 2014","true","7.2"," 21 of 24 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","21","24","0","0"

I have no problem in associating the game with the likes of Crash Bandicoot and Spyro etc.\n\nAs it stands I feel the game has all the makings of a cult classic.\n\nhttp://youtu.be/jcmRNufgsCw","August 15, 2014","true","4.7"," 25 of 31 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","25","31","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/shoggofu/recommended/314360/","shoggofu","YouTube shoggofu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/shoggofu/","257 products in account","So I’ve played this game for two hours so far, I’ve progressed about 30% of the way through the game.I think it’s good.\n- I found it really challenging, I died frequently but it was still fun\n- I thought that the visuals and sound effects were really well done\n\nhttp://youtu.be/jQlweOmieOw\nhttp://youtu.be/iLnEoFV4O08\nFrom the very beginning of the game I was dying over and over again. It was like this for me during every single section. You character is only able to take a few hits, healing is not easily obtained and there is not a large amount of room for error i.e. to make jumps, neutralize and avoid hazards. You have to patiently time your maneuvers really well and in the boss battle which I encountered you only have a split second to react to everything it does. I went through a LOT of trial and error to progress through the game. I found this frustrating sometimes, but it was challenging and good fun.\n-----I found that I needed time to get the hang of the stance mechanic. For example when you attack an enemy,  you are switched automatically to the strength stance. But often I forgot to switch back to the green agility stance and would fall to my death because this meant that I could not make some jumps. Occasionally I sort of scratched my head and wondered why they felt it necessary to have this mechanic in some cases. But I don’t think it’s a bad thing overall, it’s just different. I did like being able to switch to a stance to run faster and jump higher.\n-----You gain new abilities as you progress, by the time I finished playing I’d just acquired the ability to activate slow motion. I think that was kind of cool.\n\nI think the game looks quite good. I like the sound effects. This game brought back fond memories of the old side scrolling Donkey Kong games.\n\nI recommend checking this game out. At the rate I was progressing through it should provide five or six hours or so of gameplay. I feel that the time you can spend on this game is mainly because of the difficulty. Not because of the actual number and size of the levels. If it was easy I think the stages would actually be short. The way it is, is not necessarily a bad thing. I think it’s acceptable for a game is challenging rather having physically long levels. I’d rather play a game like that than something easy and unsatisfying.\n\nClick here for my YouTube gaming channel","August 15, 2014","true","5.3"," 21 of 26 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","21","26","0","2"

The best platform game I've ever played. This is a mix of modern and classic games. The story is simple and cool based Brazilian folklore. The music is very beautiful (I want the soundtrack (mp3) to listen to the game), the graphics are beautiful and the gameplay flows very well.","August 16, 2014","true","2.2"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","14","16","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/himmatsj/recommended/314360/","himmatsj","himmatsj","http://steamcommunity.com/id/himmatsj/","138 products in account","Aritana is a great little indie platformer. The visuals are fun and colourful, but do not let that deceive you cause the gameplay is pretty challenging (in a good way). I'd classify Aritana as a precision platformer with some action elements.\n\nThe visuals as you can see from the screenshots above are generally cheery (some levels are darker, like the ones in caves). The soundtrack is the same - cheery, happy-go-lucky music. The setting in the Amazon rainforest is a nice touch.\n\nI wasn't too fond of the default controls, since movement is tied to WASD, but the good thing is that you can fully customize the controls. So I customized it to the way I like it - movement to the arrow keys, and use the left side for the action keys. As for the physics of the game, it feels good. The character is not floaty, and he doesn't feel heavy either.\n\nThe gameplay revolves around using your powers. You can switch the state you are in, and then activate a short burst of extra energy as well. The challenge comes from executing moves precisely to continue moving in a level. It gets pretty challenging, suffice to say, and for completionists, I am sure the challenge will be even greater.\n\nIt can get frustrating at times, but the checkpoint system here at least saves the day. You can lose 3 "leaves" (more earned later) and restart where you were, after which you go back to the last checkpoint. If you lose all your lives (1 live = 3 leaves, earn more as you play), you kinda get a game over screen. Shocked me the first time really, but actually you can go back and continue playing from the beginning of the current level.\n\nPerformance wise, it was decent, except for the parts where there was rain. Noticed a huge hit to my framerate there. I've played it for around 2.5 hours and am nearly halfway completed, so I assume there should be 5 hours of game time here (more if you want to 100% it of course).\n\nOverall, I'd say Aritana is a pretty fun-♥♥♥-challenging platformer (and I never get enough of those!).  It's not particularly revolutionary, but it's well-made. Recommended to hardcore platformer fans especially!\n\nPS: I got a key from the dev to test the game, so yeah, just wanna put it out there.\n\nPSS: Steam, you're really censoring that? Come on! (No, it's not the A-word)","August 15, 2014","true","6.1"," 39 of 70 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","39","70","0","2"
