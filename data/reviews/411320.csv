"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198038466696/recommended/411320/","76561198038466696","Downright.","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198038466696/","142 products in account","Steam ,stubornly insists that it's thumbs up or thumbs down with the games it brings us..Codename: Panzers,Phase Two and the other two Codename :Panzers games in the  package are prime examples of why more  degrees of choice are required with some games. Ok the AFV models are excellent, interesting odd ball types of vehicles,yep, there is a T26B and a BA-32-2 and I believe that's a VZ semi track recovery vehicle.\nBut the spoken chat is truly terrible.. Thanks minion ,that's the 1000th time you have told me the enemy is sighted in your annoying poofie voice and sticking an "a" sound after an English word doesn't make it Italian.The acting is embarrasingly bad.Conversely the maps are large and look good enough .The missions are predictable but not totally silly.The game looks ok, old sure, but clear and quite satisfactory, battle sounds ok as well , music(part of the package) but obviously not that stirring because I cann't recollect any at all .Battles take place at extremely close range , ridiculously close range .\nApart from not running the opening unless you click no problems .glitches ,or crashes it's fine there and easy enough  to  get set up and  into the game..Conversely you can not play the Interesting Partisan game until you have completed  the two previous  campaigns.Why? I've payed for all the  game not for 2/3rds of it. That really bugs me.....\nOk why thumbs up or thumbs down? For me its only the interesting AFV that do it. Not much else,damned by faint praise perhaps?","February 18","true","1.7"," 15 of 30 people (50%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","50","15","30","3","4"
