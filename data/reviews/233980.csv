You play as Daniel, a typical nerd who suddenly finds himself either hallucinating or somehow transported inside the tabletop game he’s been playing—he’s not sure which.\n\nSoon after, you are exploring a castle full of deadly enemies and traps, searching for the exit.  The dungeon is divided into segments typical of a Metroidvania, requiring you to power up, level up, defeat an area’s boss to obtain a key so you may progress to the next area, and so on.  The boss battles themselves are well-crafted and interesting, except for one that effectively forces you to drop your items on the ground, which was a terrible idea.\n\nYou’ll meet a reluctant companion very early on who will remain with you throughout the game and serves as the other half of most of the dialog and story.  The dialog tends to be on the humorous side and tries, maybe a little too hard, at incorporating some nerd humor and pop culture references into everything you do.\n\nThere are many secrets to be found within the walls of the castle; shopkeepers and quest givers to meet; pets to recruit, who will follow you around and offer unique abilities; and in-game challenges to complete, which are actually quite challenging.  A robust magic system, based on reagents and eight schools of magic, is in place along with alchemy and your typical melee and ranged skills and weapons.  Leveling up will let you distribute stat points and skill points across these as you see fit, with harder difficulties rewarding you with more points to distribute as well as the ability to save your game manually.\n\nUnepic does have its flaws: Other than the humor not being for everyone, even people who typically don’t get hung up on graphics may find the game to be ugly and, while the lighting can be nicely done, the minigame of wading through the darkness to light all the torches can become tiring, as can climbing ladders on every screen.  In spite of this, a solid RPG lies at the core and it’s obvious the developer put a lot of work, and love, into making the game.","November 26, 2013","true","37.0"," 188 of 198 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","188","198","0","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/scotth266/recommended/233980/","scotth266","Scott","http://steamcommunity.com/id/scotth266/","433 products in account","A Metroidvania game with distinctly strategic combat that encourages you to think outside the box.  It's part RPG: you can equip weapons, armor, and potions, and when you kill enemies you gain XP. When you level up, you get skill points that let you use better gear.\n\nWhere this game differs from other Metroidvanias is the combat, which is very deliberate and feels almost puzzle-like at times.  If you try to hack and slash in Unepic, you'll do little more than die horribly.  You're encouraged to carefully pick off foes and try different weapons and tactics.\n\nFor example, daggers are fast-hitting, and hit hard when used against enemies from behind.  Swords do better against organic beings, while maces crush armored foes.  Axes are the middle ground, doing average damage to both kinds of enemies.  Polearms are great for poking dudes you don't want to sit next to (enemies with poison HURT).  Using magic (or at least bows) is mandatory, as some enemies won't let you fight them in melee.\n\nThe game also has some punishing boss fights that creatively abuse game mechanics.  One telepathy-based-boss will use his mental powers to force you to suicide by using your damaging spells against you.  The solution? Dump all your magic essences in the bank (except your healing ones) so that he can't make you do anything bad.  But be careful to also dump your teleport items, or you'll be sorry when the boss hits low HP :)\n\nThe writing/story of the game is a paradox: both thought-provoking and incredibly juvenile.  One moment you'll have a thoughtful discussion with a ghostly hitchiker about the castle you find yourself stuck in, and the next your character will be a complete jackass, taunting someone who's having an existential crisis.  The protagonist sometimes acts generously and other times is motivated by complete greed.  It feels very inconsistent, though a few moments of the script really shine through.\n\nThe ending of the game is a significant twist, but also has a boss fight that some will find immensly irritating - it's a real challenge of your skills.\n\nOverall I'd recommend Unepic.  It's a surprisingly deep game for having been made by only one dude, and while you may be put off by some of the juvenile dialouge, it can be a real treat gameplay-wise so long as you don't try to hack and slash your way through it.","November 3, 2014","true","51.7"," 160 of 167 people (96%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","96","160","167","3","0"

It all starts when I was looking for something similar to old Castlevania series... The search came up with this game. At first I was not sure about it, but decided to buy - it was worth it. About the game mechanics, UnEpic is a platform RPG. The in-game map is filled in with monsters as you enter each new room, and some important locations aren’t even labeled. Every room is shrouded in darkness, it is up to you to manually light torches fixed around every room just to see where to go. Enemies are incredibly unbalanced, and it’s much easier to survive using projectile weapons than melee ones. UnEpic gets really hard sometimes, don't underestimate it! But still it's really addictive.","May 24, 2015","true","8.4"," 128 of 173 people (74%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","74","128","173","9","6"

Unepic melds the two into a challenging and hilarious adventure that will easily last you upwards of 20 hours while you explore the game’s dungeons.\n\nThe story follows a tabletop gamer who suddenly finds himself in an enchanted tower filled with ghouls, goblins, and all manner of beasts. He quickly becomes possessed by a nameless dark spirit who finds that he is unable to control our hero! Worse yet, he’s stuck inside his body until our hero’s death! What could have been little more than a driving force for Unepic’s protagonist quickly becomes one of its strongest qualities, as the hero and spirit are able to communicate with one another, and they do so often. The dialogue between them is witty and hilarious, and the back and forth caused me to laugh out loud on numerous occasion.\n\nBeyond the platforming, Unepic features a healthy dose of varying modes of combat. This is where the more methodical nature of the game comes into play, as many run-ins with the enemies and traps each dungeon possesses require patience and the right tool set to keep from a quick death. The shear amount of items at your disposal is impressive, and many items carry benefits most suited for specific situations. Besides the weapon variety, there’s a plethora of equipables, skills, potions, recipes, and spells that you can find, buy and earn through quests given by NPC’s littering the castle.\n\nThe combat itself is admittedly slow and clunky, but this only adds to the more strategic pace of enemy encounters. You can’t just run in and attack; many of the enemies you’ll face possess the same reach and even more ferocity than you do, and attracting their attention without a plan will get you killed. On higher difficulties, this is amplified, as beyond being stronger, enemies have a far greater range of sight, and many can attack you from a distance, and interrupt your own movements. On the highest difficulty, you even lose the several moments of invulnerability that comes after each hit, meaning that you lose any hope of rushing Leroy Jenkins style and coming out alive. It’s such a superb feature that I’m honestly surprised that I’ve never seen something similar before.\n\nUnepic is superb. Make no mistake, this is one of those rare titles worth more than the asking price. If you’ve ever enjoyed Super Metroid or Symphony of the Night, you will thoroughly enjoy spending hours at a time on this game. If you’re one of the few who loved Demon/Dark Souls, you’ll find no better 2D substitute. If you’re like me, and adore both styles of play, then rejoice, because you’ve found the ultimate combination of the two. Unepic is hilariously crass, filled with pop culture references, and provides a several dozen hour long adventure filled with secrets and sidequests. You’d be a fool to pass it up.\n\nThis review is based solely on the finished single player experience. There is an unfinished multiplayer mode that I’ve yet to sample, and I will edit this review with my feelings on it if/when I try it out.\n","June 28, 2014","true","11.6"," 54 of 62 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","54","62","0","5"

The only reason this game by Ninja Gamers chose this title is due to the fact that Blue Sky Studios licensed EPIC before they got the chance. Because trust me, this game is everything and more compared to your everyday role player. This platformer/RPG is a hack and slash blast keeping you on your toes, not only with mesmerizing gameplay but an authentic story line that continues constantly throughout the game.\n\nThere are so many different options when it comes to this game its incredible, and almost a little bit too much to take in at first. But don’t worry, everything becomes fluid after only a few short minutes of gameplay, and the controls are easy to get familiar with. Not your average platformer, UnEpic comes with its own crafting system and recipes that you must learn to make certain potions. They also integrate this in with the main characters magic abilities, whereas you must obtain and learn each spell. Whether it be an award from a quest or buying the tome directly from one of the games multiple item shops. The weaponry is awesome, with various choices ranging from staffs, axes, wands, swords, maces, and more. Each weapon sometimes unique with its own special attribute, leaves you well armed while on your adventure.\n\nYou play as Daniel, a video game developer, huge fan of sci-fi, and a novice RPG player. In the middle of a RPG he is transported to a castle. At first, Daniel believed that he was having a massive hallucination, and that the world he was thrown into couldnt logically be real. Eager to keep playing within the RPG to create his own adventure, he decides to go along for the ride until his delirium comes to an end. Once inside the castle, Daniel is possessed by a dark spirit that can communicate with him, but not control him. Struggling against enemies in the castle, with the dark spirit attempting to murder him at every turn, Daniel finally discovers his goal: kill Harnakon, the master of the castle.\n\nFrom the second i heard about this game and downloaded the demo I knew it was destined for greatness. UnEpic is one of those games you can sit down and play for hours, or just a few minutes while waiting for that pepperoni hot pocket to cool down. The story will keep you intrigued from the second you pick up your controller to the moment you put it down, and if you’re anything like me, will continue to plague your mind while at work. During the week I bought UnEpic I found myself dying to punch the clock so I could quickly get home and get an hour or two in. Its games like these that are not only fun to play, but addicting from every aspect, making gaming something to get excited about, and look forward too.\n\nSometimes developers leave out small details that can make or break a game. That’s certainly not the case when it comes to UnEpic. Details such as paying attention to your weapon and armor, because like your character, they also take damage and need to be repaired to function properly. This is done through visiting the blacksmith in the item shops, where you will also be able to buy newer weapons or stock up on projectiles. Crafting “recipies” take place in the castles kitchens, where the cook will be able to sell you the vital essences that each potion requires. While dredging through the castles sewers leaches become attached to you dealing damage, and are stored in your inventory, so until you remove them you continue to lose health. In my opinion its details like these that put UnEpic in  a category of its own.\n\nWhen it comes to something like “replay factor” this game is much like any other RPG. Although, with several of the different capabilities that set it aside from others, it makes it tempting to run through yet again. I find when it comes to games like UnEpic, I will beat it on the normal difficulty setting first, then try my hand at hard. This is something that the Diablo franchise engraved in me, as I am sure many other gamers have been affected by. Sometimes at the end of a game you are left wanting more, and I find varied levels of toughness help give the game that extra added edge that changes everything for a gamer. UnEpic cured this by adding in the use of a multiplayer mode, allowing you to choose several different ways to continue your “UnEpic” journey.\n\nFive different modes make up multiplayer, including, Co-Op, Deathmatch, Conquest, Race and Survival. Each of which have their own cut scene introductions that are unique to what mode/dungeon that you are playing. They begin with the main character Daniel sitting at a table with friends playing a role-playing game complete with a Dungeon Master narrating your every move. You start off alone if you choose or with other players, and fight your way through each different level. There is also an option to build your own dungeon, depending on how far you’ve gotten in the Conquest mode of multiplayer. The only downfall I find with UnEpic’s multiplayer option is the inability to play as your single player character, but again, as I said before this only adds to the replay factor.\n\nWhat else can I say? UnEpic offers so much and is perfectly packaged, a game of this caliber is essential for fans of platformers, RPG, and action hack and slash. You have so many options at your fingertips in this game, and that is what sets it aside from all the rest. From the dynamics of gameplay, the creative and compelling story and intricate detail in the graphics, UnEpic is worth every penny and won’t let you down.","November 28, 2013","true","15.5"," 53 of 61 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","53","61","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/no13/recommended/233980/","no13","Lucky Thirteen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/no13/","340 products in account","Contradicting its title, Unepic is an epic 2D side-scrolling RPG with a touch of platforming elements.\n\nYou play as Daniel, who gets teleported into a mysterious castle during a pen-and-paper RPG session with his friends. Soon enough, Daniel finds himself possessed by a sinister entity who unvoluntarily becomes his guide throughout the journey.\nAt first, Daniel believes that this whole mishap is just a hallucination and acts as if he was playing a video game, which leads to genuinely amusing dialogues filled with pop culture refferences (World of Warcraft, Star Trek, Star Wars etc).\n\nBut well-written dialogues is just one of Unepic's positives.\nThe locations are distinguishable enough from each other and, if you like 2D graphic,  visually pleasing. Definitelly not what you'd call "monotonous".\nControls feel just right most of the time, with just a few design flaws (for example taking damage cancels your targeting, which can get annoying in some situations).\nThe game's difficulty is fairly ballanced.\nYou can play on Easy, Normal, Hard or Hard++ and whichever difficulty you choose, you'll get more or less what you expect.\nEasy is super-easy. Normal and Hard are the well ballanced "middle course". Hard++ gets more serious.\nUnlike many other games out there, Unepic also managed to find a good compromise with providing information to the player. They do a good job of explaining what's what at the early stage, but you don't get the feeling that they're holding your hand.\nAnother thing that deserves to be mentioned is the voice acting. All the voice actors did an excellent job.\n\n\nAll in all, Unepic is an incredibly well done indie game, definitelly worth playing :)\n","July 14, 2015","true","80.1"," 36 of 38 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","36","38","0","1"

I've never really played D&D, however, I've heard various people that I've come across regale me with their Adventures having good times with good folk'...er' good people.\n\nBeing a Lone Wolf myself, this game inspires Adventures within the same context that is often described to my by the aforementioned D&D players, without the good folk'/people part of it! I mean, you can always play Multiplayer, however, I often play the Single Player campaigns, thus the sheer awesomeness of this game since it caters to my bias/relevance.\n\nNow, with all of that being said, I cannot really say that the Customization Options are as in -depth as D&D could be - since I'm sure a lot of D&D players had gotten quite upset that I'm referring to this as my D&D Lite - but that in no way takes away from this game as a whole! The Customization that is offered is still pretty awesome within it's own sense. With all of this being said though, I'm pretty sure the people reading this want to hear stuff about the Gameplay other than my own ramblings on what this game resembles.\n\nThe Graphics are quite retro bit-esque and I tend to really enjoy that sort of thing - so for me this isn't a big issue - but I can see how certain players may tire of this sort of thing when it comes to the next-gen stuff...That being said, if that's your cup'o'tea then clearly, it's not relevant to your own bias.  It's a 'Dark Themed' game when it comes to the Setting as it IS SUPPOSED to be in a Castle somewhere, however, with that being said, it still gives off this colorful sensation - without being too weird about it.\n\nThe Gameplay itself is quite reminiscent of various Side-Scrollers I've grown up with - from MMO's to other Single Player games - so for me it really isn't an issue. There are things that aren't relevant to my bias, and that would include Farming/Grinding various things in a lot of games. Having said that, there are times in this game where you will have to grind and farm various ingredients, going to-and-fro, back-and-forth from room-to-room looking for those Bats and their Bat Wings, or looking for those Satyr's and their damned Intestines, but all in all, I think that's what adds to the charm of the game. One needs to be prepared for the devastating Traps placed everywhere, or for all of those various Monsters that will either Poison you, or just beat the crap out of you!\n\nWith everything else, one has to ask what of the Sound? Well, for me again - and keep in mind this is a very biased review considering I enjoyed...nay, am still enjoying the hell out of this game - it's not bad! A lot of games these days have tried to over complicated various Telegraphs - those Attacks that are shown to you - with Circles around your feet, or various Shapes that co-ordinate with various timings making it much easier to see these Attacks, and have stopped using Colors/Sounds to Hint these Telegraphs for you! Think of Ocarina of Time for example, within the text of said game, you would see various words highlighted in Green/Red/Blue/etc. that would provide the Hints for you as to where you were to go, and not have everything laid out for you. In UnEpic, you'll actually HEAR when you've been spotted, or when you've been seen and you'll have to make sure that you pay attention as it will also indicate when you can/will lose all of that 'Aggro' and not get bested!\n\nWhew...that's a lot to talk about, but I think I have one last thing to review for UnEpic. The Graphics for me personally are awesome - some may not like it, - the Gameplay is quite appealling to me as it's not truly a Turn-Based style and has it's own Side-Scrolling action/platforming elements - and again, this may not cater to everyone, - the Sound for me once more is still quite enjoyable...but I think the thing that really puts it over the edge (and bare in mind, this is coming from someone who doesn't pay a lot of attention to this particular portion of MOST games...and when I say that, I mean I rarely pay attention to this portion in a LOT of games) is the Story.\n\nThe Story itself is freaking amazing. Well...not so much an amazing concept of a Story when it comes to what the Plot is. The Plot can be seen as something that's probably generic in a lot of Adventure games - especially when you think of the D&D-esque type Adventure games. You have a Hero - one that you're in charge of, so you're the Hero - who's on a Quest to do stuff! Stuff that generally involves killing a lot of Monsters, or Mobs, and then Bosses...you get the idea. That generally sums up any game really, lol. What really makes this thing amazing, and shine, is the delivery of said Plot/Story.\n\nOne can take the everyday occurrence of a Hero on a Quest, and turn it into something marvelous by embedding comedy, drama, horror, or even sheer stupidity within the concept! The amount of times I've laughed in various places of the dialogue in this game has been...well numerous! I thoroughly enjoy comedy, and you can't ignore the classics - granted again this is biased as I'm a 24 year old Male - of Fart Jokes, or Crap Jokes (literally.) The give-and-take of the Duo on this Quest - our Hero, and one of his current enemies - is just something that gels well within the game and I would argue, sets a certain tone/mood for the entirety of the game. You get invested in the Characters - both of them - throughout the journey as you come to learn more about not only themselves, but the whole strcuture they're in!\n\n\n\n\n\nWell, I can really go on and on about this game for every little thing as I've enjoyed it so much, but right now I think I'll leave a few more words here for those who are still on the fence about this game - but please bare in mind that I'm probably going to be biased as I've enjoyed this game thoroughly!\n\nIf you don't mind the Side-Scrolling action Gameplay, nor the Retro bit-esque Graphics, or even the concept of Grind/Farm that you will more than likely have to go through...then please, by all means pick up this little gem of a game as you'll find yourself laughing/roaring through certain portions of the game, and probably feeling the ambience that the general game provides!","February 28, 2014","true","27.0"," 59 of 75 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","59","75","0","0"

The task seems to be too easy. How hard can it be? A bunch of old guys with long white beards, couple of mentally disabled protagonists, dark overlord behaving like an angsty teenager — there you have it, add a few butt jokes and we’re good. And when you look closer it turns out there’s not a lot of more than a mix-up of ♥♥♥♥ jokes, fart jokes and lots of people “hilariously” falling for whatever reasons. When the genre itself is balancing acrobat on the string of heroic attitude strained upon an abyss of mindless self-repetitive nonsense, it's so easy to make a parody that is just bad example of the genre itself. I think you guessed what I think of UnEpic’s script. It’s a story of pimply geek Daniel, teleported into the dungeons of castle of the Dark Overlord right in the middle of D&D session. And if that doesn’t give you enough notion, this magical transportation happened when he walked to have a leak, because he drank too much beer. Upon arrival our hero makes contact with some dark spirit, it ends up with spirit being trapped in protagonist’s body (or rather mind?) and capable of nothing more than talking. And that he does a lot! Mostly sarcastically, and rarely speaking the truth. Believing that he’s having a very realistic hallucination our ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ protagonist starts his quest, which is of course nothing less than slaying the biggest villain here. And so it starts, the mix-up of ♥♥♥♥ jokes, and fart jokes and quests which quite bluntly task you with ♥♥♥♥ing an orc; and ex-virgin geek is happy to do it.\nSo, if UnEpic couldn’t give you anything besides this rather unartful humour it shouldn’t be even worth writing about. But thankfully from a merit of a game it’s no joke. The game won’t win a prize for the most sophisticated world, but it sure is vast. There’s no shortage of easily missable side-quests, different enemies and varying pieces of valuable equipment. But while actually there’s not a lot of need for trying out some magic or ranged weapons, you sure can experiment a lot. But hey, no every game can be Transistor and give you a meaningful stimulus for trying out everything. Sometimes the joy of toying with varying mechanics is enough of a reward for itself. What sure is absolutely mandatory for easy game progression is crafting and collecting all sort of magical scrolls, wands and ingredients for making potions. Power-ups help quite a lot, especially on those hard-hitting bosses, who usually aren’t very tricky, but require a bit of a precise movement which isn’t something that can be easily achieved considering monstrous control scheme (and I don’t even want to know into a what more horrible mess it become when game was ported on Wii U).\nAll the downsides of the game are tolerable in the end, when it comes to really superb level design, with a slow but interesting progression path. The castle slowly turns from Terra Incognita into your playground, where you casually go for a walk for another pack of so valuable satyr intestines. Then there’s this key and that key, and new area, and new enemies which require careful planning before you rush off into the battle. Monsters are quite powerful, have the same reach as a player and often enough they output more damage, while being invincible to some types of attack.\nUnEpic looks, feels and plays a lot like very old metroidvania, and even contains homage to The Maze of Galious, 1987 game by Konami for MSX and Famicom; developer calls it the main source of inspiration for a game. This retro-feel sure is nice, it has a substance of real love to those games, and while sometimes it can be a bit rough to get in to, it sure knows what to do once the player got its pace.","August 15, 2014","true","27.8"," 36 of 43 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","36","43","0","0"

You hack and slash your way through a 2D castle using a variety of different weapons, spells and pets in order to defeat the bosses and open new areas of the castle to explore.\n\nThe actual combat itself is actually quite basic, you simple press a button and it causes an attack animation, and typically half the time you just stand still and hit - so why did I give it a 9/10 for combat? It's because of the variety of weapons the game gives you and the variety of enemies you get put up against. Yes, the combat is slightly lacking in the Melee department but you're quite limited when it comes to a 2D game. It's when you have to think about your enemies strengths and weaknesses is where the combat really shines. Fleshy creatures like the Slimey Worms are almost immune to 'bashy' weapons like the Maces, but they take more damage from 'sharp' weapons like the Swords. Some creatures don't have any real strengths or weaknesses and others have the polar opposite and can only be harmed by that specific type of weapon or spell.\n\nSpells on the other hand, I haven't really ventured too far into, I probably will go for a full Mage combat style in a second play-through but at the moment I've only really tested the waters but I can say that it focuses a lot more on the strengths and weaknesses structure than Melee does.\n\nThe graphics of the game is fine, but it's the lighting that really makes this game shine. Each room has a lights which the player must light up in order to see, and when all a lit a nice chirpy sound plays. It gives the game a real sense of accomplishment - that after you have lit all the lights, this zone now belongs to you; you have conquered it and this is just a simple graphical minigame that has managed to do this!\n\nThe progression in this game is just incredible though, there may not be that many items to choose from but the levelling and skills distribution in this game really makes it all feel worth while. Upgrading weapons and skills has a noticeable effect on everything that you do. After playing for a while and levelling you notice that when going back to old enemies they become really easy to kill, it gives you that sense of progression; not only knowing that you've become stronger as time has gone by but you feel stronger and the game gives you that exact feeling.\n\nI highly recommend this game to everyone!\n\n\n\nLink to my YouTube Channel.\nLink to my Twitter Page.\n{LINK REMOVED} Link to my Blog.\nLink to my Curations.","April 11, 2015","true","28.7"," 73 of 116 people (63%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","63","73","116","7","8"

I've been waiting for it to come to Steam, because, frankly, it deserved to be on here. It's an amazing (Metroidvania-like) platformer with RPG elements, and it has some funny (but also annoying/childish) dialogs in it.\n\nThe world of UnEpic looks equally amazing thanks to the fantastic lighting in it. Along the way you'll find or earn gear that makes your character stronger, just like any other RPG basically. There are sidequests and bossfights, secrets to find, torches to light, you name it. It's a big world and completing the game will take you probably somewhere between 15-20 hours. That's long, if you ask me, especially for a price this low.\n\nOnly thing that truly annoyed me was the fact that it saves randomly, and it never shows an indication on when it's exactly saving. Not a big problem, but there's one boss fight that requires you to drop quite a few items. It was during that moment that I had to quit and the game saved my location, but not the items on the ground. So when I resumed I lost all of those items. 'Frustrating' is the word I'm looking for here. I hope it gets fixed before the official release, or that it allows you to manually save your game, instead of the game doing this for you. Ok, ok, enough rambling about something no one cares about.\n\nVerdict: UnEpic is an epic game that needs to be experienced by all gamers out there.\n\n[Rating: 82/100]","June 28, 2013","true","19.9"," 20 of 23 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","20","23","0","0"

Will come to that later.\n\nPremise is simple but well executed with plenty self-aware humor and nods to many cliches and franchises. During a D&D game-night with friends you get sucked into a real dungeon or rather castle. And boy is it a castle indeed. It's huge. Separated into several areas with unique themes and enemies. You slowly get to explore the castle, open up new areas in your journey to meet the master of the castle Harnakon. Each area has a boss fight which drops a key opening a previously locked area. Besides the main quest each area also harbors a Pure Spirit with a quest. These are particularly interesting since the loot is a whole new character skill which opens the path for various spells and skills. On top of these there are also more menial side quests abound which net you either gold, a companion pet or a special weapon. All in all, there is always something to do once you go exploring a new area. These quests sadly are almost always very similar in that you need to collect certain elements in the near vicinity and thus can get repetitive. The rewards make them still worthwhile.\n\nThe way you beat the plethora of enemies in the castle depends on you though. From classic melee weaponry to staves, potions to spells, the options at hand are enormous. You will need to decide early on which playstyle to choose since enemies become more powerful as you explore further and the necessary stats to wield apt weapon, spells and armor increases as well. Thankfully there was a side quest that netted me a one-time item to respec. I got stumped at a certain boss for good after having neglected Bow stats. This aspect, the stats and immense amount of spells, swords, maces, axes, hammers, bows, robes, armor, potions, staves, wands and their each respective stats you can level up surprised me by sheer depth. It was fun to change pace from melee combat to magic based combat. Weirdly enough Shields are a total no-show. A shame since melee combat ends up mindless button mostly.\n\nThe boss fights were usually the highlight of each area. They are all very unique not only visually but in their regular and special attacks which makes for a fun and fair challenge even while dying many times. For the most part. And this is where the grand finale comes up again. It's a blunder. A dud. A total wreck. Everything you learned up to this point gets thrown out the window. Suddenly you find yourself under time pressure. Not only fighting a boss but going through a whole area filled with enemies. But that's not even the worst part. You also get suddenly control over a second character where you have to fend of enemy waves with some light strategy/tower-defense elements. This especially does not work well with the game. Having two dozen characters have an all-out war is not meant for this viewpoint. You don't see what is happening, who is friend or foe, even where your own character is. Most importantly it is not fun. The best moments in the game are boss encounters where you have to time attacks, run at the right time and repeat. These fights give you control, clarity and the time needed for the right tactic. The final fight is a rushed catastrophe compared to that. You never feel certain what is happening with all the character switching, strategic NPC placement and time pressure.  And when you die, you start the whole area from start.\n\nNo thanks. If it's not fun, I'm not game. So I still call this a finished game since I got to the end. All in all, Unepic is a fun and surprisingly deep and big game with passable combat mechanics. This won't be a good time for many I assume. Movement, combat they all feel not overtly satisfying but it's definitely a case of greater than the sum of its parts. Give it a try. You might like it like I did and get close to 30 hours of a good time out of it.","May 30","true","27.0"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","0"

Role-playing games like Dark Souls punish so mercilessly that some consider the rewards too few in between countless deaths and frustrations to be worthwhile. Not everyone finds that kind of torture fun.\n\nOne little game from Spain takes that challenging trial-and-error gameplay, makes it manageable, and blends it with the style of Castlevania, where every screen holds fresh hordes of enemies and traps, as well as shortcuts to make navigating a colossal castle drastically but not infinitely easier. UnEpic is the RPG for Dungeons & Dragons nerds who ever wished they could teleport away to a fantasy realm of dark priests and reanimated skeletons.\n\nA newcomer to the pen-and-paper game, Daniel leaves his table of friends for a quick break that turns into a 20-plus-hour long adventure when the bathroom turns out to be a portal to a mysterious castle.\n\nDaniel is much more fluent in the language of video games than tabletop RPGs, which is where UnEpic's humor comes from. Possessed by a demonic spirit upon entering the castle, he gives his new companion a nickname and goes along with what he thinks is a drugged-beer-induced hallucination. He uses his own logic to survive by embarking on quests he's not supposed to and making up stories to manipulate the creatures and spirits of the castle. He tells them he's Saruman or Jean Luc Picard or an agent of the great Harnakon, the castle ruler, so that he can earn their magic and eventually find a way home.\n\nAs they explore, players complete a castle map and can jot down notes about each room. One of the earliest items you acquire is the most useful: a “halo” that you can hotkey so it teleports you directly to the hub of the castle, where you can recover health and save the game. This is what curbs much of the difficulty and prevents it from becoming overwhelming. As players venture to new areas – the mines full of goblins, the catacombs riddled with undead, the gardens grown thick with dangerous plants and bugs – they can zip back to safety as soon as death looms near and then bank their progress. Even dying only sets you back a little way, as the game frequently autosaves your position.\n\nThis system keeps the game from becoming frustrating, for the most part. With each level up, players can distribute skill points into different weapons and stats, and the options only increase with every new gained ability. The problem is, overcoming some bosses and enemy situations is dependent on a mix of strengths, but you won’t know what they are until they’re needed.\n\nI started out switching at will between swords, maces, polearms, and bows, using whatever one best fit my current purpose. Polearms were good for attacking stronger enemies while keeping them at bay, and bows served me well until I could learn magic. Heavier weapons like maces and axes can break barrels and boxes that conceal coins and items, but swords are quicker. I pumped points into these and other specialties only to discover that I didn’t need some of them later in the game, when I could only afford to concentrate on developing select skills. Instead of continuing to swap tactics on the fly – a refreshing approach – my priorities changed so that I finished the game mostly with axes and a bunch of wasted skill points. Worse, you only get one chance to respec.\n\nI made it halfway through without experiencing the sweat and vulgarity of frustration, until reaching a boss that was stupidly hard. Neuron – a giant floating eyeball that casts mental spells – arguably requires the most resources, time, and persistence of all the bosses, but he was the first of several annoyances. Among them are tedious quests, ruthless bosses, and enemies with inconsistent respawns.\n\nAside from these changes, I like the gradual, incremental progression of UnEpic. I don’t fear death here like I would in Dark Souls, where demise means the loss of hard-earned souls, and the game doesn’t grease my palms with sweat like it would in an intense platformer such as Super Meat Boy. Yet it’s just as enjoyable if not more so. New areas are daunting at first, but by the time you’re ready to face the boss, you know them backward and forward. That’s a real feeling of accomplishment. Some scenarios are needlessly hard, however, like the final challenge that splits your attention two ways and costs considerable time and energy to complete. Redistributing stats once may not be enough to carry some players through the game.\n\nUnEpic also features a multiplayer mode where you can partner with other players to try out cooperative dungeon maps or player-versus-player deathmatch or races. The pool of players seemed so small when I joined, though, that the matching system didn’t work as well as intended, and it would force me into quests that I didn’t want or that weren’t right for me. I felt like a burden on the higher-level players in my party.\n\nFor what it is, UnEpic is incredibly robust and never once feels boring. There’s a ton to do and see, from learning new magic to completing side quests and lighting every torch in the castle. It’s much more pure adventure than story, although the game has plenty of both.\n\nRecommended\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","November 24, 2014","true","27.8"," 32 of 50 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","32","50","0","0"

I don't regret what I paid for it; for as far as I was able to get it was worth the price of admission. However, the game part of Unepic is very lacking. Most of the issue I have with the game is its repetition and its boss fights. The environments, while decorated differently, are all very samey and monotonous. The interest of exploration is lost about an hour into the game leaving you with a very samey combat system. The humor and story kept me drilling through the same dozen enemies for another dozen hours.\n\nThe boss fights finally did me in though, 10 hours into the game there is a boss you simply cannot fight unless you have strong melee, 15 hours into the game there is a boss that a melee-centric character cannot fight. And, after playing 20 hours as my chosen class, to have progression stopped unless I completely changed the way I played for one fight was the nail in the coffin.\n\nYou had potential Unepic but 2/5 for you =\","January 15, 2014","false","25.0"," 155 of 275 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","155","275","0","11"

The graphics may look subpar compared to modern gaming, but remember that the game is based off of Metroidvania, 2D hack and slash with more emphasis on action than aesthetics.\nWhen you start up the game, you get a cutscene of a couple of guys playing Dungeons and Dragons, with nothing but an overhead lantern and a ton of beer. Next thing you know, you're in a medieval castle filled with traps, monsters, and loot. The rest is up to you.\nUnEpic is a great game. Gameplay wise, you have simple yet complex with a basic "space to attack" and arrow key movement. Throw in about 10 different weapon types, pets that assist in combat and out, potions that have various effects, and an expansive (it's not that bad) character skill page. You now have a game that combines the best of rogue-like, RPG, hack and slash, and platformer.\nAs for the protagonist, you play as Strider, also known as Aragorn II, son of Arathorn and his companion Zera, the wight of-\nNevermind, your name is Daniel. You're a gamer, a sci-fi fanatic, and you have a sharp tongue for sarcasm and inappropriate jokes, especially at the expense of the equally as sarcastic spirit that tried and failed to possess you. Expect every encounter with friend, or foe, to make you smile at least once before blood is spilt.\nThe castle itself is a labyrinth of rooms that, thankfully, do not change constantly. Explore, fill in your map and make notes on what's here, what's there, where your quest door is- Light up rooms full of monsters and treasure, and a ton of breakable barrels. For the completionists, grab every chest and light every torch. For the hunters, destroy every monster in your path with the arsenal of weapons and magics stuffed in the side pocket of your jeans. Expect alarming encounters with big bosses like dragons or worms, and swarms of smaller minions like.. dragons. And worms.\nCollect materials, brew potions, find gold, buy loot. You want candles? You want swords? You want books? Zoran, Zorak, Ubuntu, and Fedora have got you covered.\nDo menial tasks for handicapped goblins! Ever wanted to kill the puppy-version of Sindel? How about look for a silver ring in a dark room? How about go rescue an ice elemental from a boiling cauldron?\nBuy this game! It has singleplayer and multiplayer, the latter of which I have not tried but it looks awesome. Set aside a lot of time, however. Postpone that Dungeons and Dragons game with your buddies until next week. But whatever you do, don't go to the bathroom with the lights off.","September 12, 2015","true","7.8"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","80","12","15","6","3"

I tought I would get bored after a few minutes but I just couldn't stop from playing it! I loved it really hard and would totally recommend it to a friend.\n\nPROS:\n* The graphics are amazing. I love this 8-bit style games and if you love it too it should count as pro\n* There are two different views from the camera (I played the entire game 'unzoomed')\n* The controller support is amazing. I played with diferent controls and they were all fine.\n* The audio is pretty good too. Each area has its own main audio and the game has english audio for most dialogues.\n* No bugs at all. On my gameplay (~31h) I didn't had a single bug or problem caused by bad programming.\n* There are many nerd/geek jokes and references trough the game and this is awesome.\n* The end is particularly interesting. You should play it to see. The cinematics are cool too.\n\nCONS (They are Really silly):\n* Some abilities are 'necessary' to finish the game (It's not that bad because I got stuck in a single room because I didn't learned some ability trough the game)\n* Can't copy save or save in another slot.

There are also funny and enjoyable voice dialogs.\n\nThe graphics and sound aren't something special, but they are not bad at all either.\n\nThe gameplay is easy to learn and there are a lot of things to customize. Key shortcuts or notes on mini-map are very convenient. There's also a variety of cool weapons, lots of abilities, spells, scrolls, pets and artifacts, unique weapons and specials that can be bought with rare UN points from challenges. The enemies have strengths and weaknesses accordingly.\n\nThe difficulty is normal to high, but eventually you can move on. Many areas require good reflexes and there are moments that test your patience and they may get you angry. You will die a lot or you'll have to try over and over again to pass them.\n\nGenerally, all the castle areas have the same main quests and goals. Good thing is that there are some mini-quests and secrets in each one, which add a little bit of variety.\n\nNote that there is a limited save system and a punishing anti-cheat mechanism. I suggest you backup your save files often. They will come in handy later near the end (eg. the different endings or in my game, when I had a pure fighter class and I had to kill distant Wyverns with a healer elf supporting them and I didn't have strong projectiles to harm them fast enough).\n\nHowever the minor issues, the game is very addictive, with cool RPG, platform and action elements and enjoyable dialogs.","June 4","true","41.4"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","3"

I had this game on my Wishlist for a while and eventually decided to purchase it.\n\nThe Single player game is completed but I found a couple issues where the voice wouldn't come through and it was just the text.

If you love games like Rogue Legacy then you must buy this one as well.\n\n\nInterface:\nMy first impression of the interface from the screenshots was that it would be clunky and complicated. However, it’s actually pretty easy to use and aside from that annoying quest log (It changes it's active quest all the time...) the interface is very well done and not confusing at all. The inventory management can actually be done with a auto-sort function instead of manually having to adjust items to fit them in yourself.\n\nAlso most of the singleplayer dialogs are narrated and the voices are well chosen.\n\n\nBalance:\nPeople usually claim that spell casters is powerful however I only find this true for multiplayer once you reach level 5 or higher. Spellcasters become pretty overpowered at this point since there is no requirements in multiplayer to unlock abilities unlike single player. Completing certain areas or quests in single player is the only way to unlock abilities.  Alteration for an example is a magic ability you cannot invest in until you complete certain quests. Melee class is feasible in singleplayer as long as armor upgrades are being worked on otherwise you could be overwhelmed.\n\n\nReplayability:\nChallenges and multiplayer are the biggest replayability factors since the game lacks a new game+ mode. Luckily the multiplayer is extremely hard if you try to solo it and even with 2 players it can be really challenging if you don't fully optimize your builds and the difficulty curve in multiplayer-maps, the difficulty feels just about right. You must grind your level, essences and gear in multiplayer just as in singleplayer. That will keep you busy ;).\n\n\nMultiplayer:\nI missed the female protagonist a bit and the multiplayer code is really bad. I mean, it works without bugs and without crashes but even with the tiniest amount of latency (like 50ms) you still lag HORRIBLY. You get delays that are like 1-2 seconds long and you get randomly teleported across the screen and projectiles and such are all calculated from the host without any leniency for lag so you can guess how that will be... The game's code does not feel optimized for multiplayer at all.\n\nYou can also create your own dungeons but your progress (experience, loot and such) is not saved there, so not many people want to play your dungeon. You can't alter your own house/town.\n\nThere is sadly no local co-up as an option to play with your friends in the singleplayer dungeon.\nYou always have to spent at (the very) least 4 points in healing no matter what build you take. There is no other alternative in multiplayer because the potions-skill is singleplayer-only and relying on random heal drops is not all that great.\n\nThere are mostly US people online and 80% of the games are password protected. If you are from EU/ASIA/AUS/etc. then you will most likely have to find a friend to play with you because the lag otherwise would be unplayable.\n\n\nMy conclusion\nI bought it for around 3 bucks and found the game to be worth more than what I paid for. The game is really well made and you can clearly see that the developer invested a lot of time into this game to fully perfect it. It's also pretty much bug free.\n\n\nSome sections of this review were rewritten by Falem","December 22, 2014","true","57.6"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","11","15","2","1"

After heading into the dark bathroom he suddenly starts noticing strange things while looking for the lightswitch. After pulling out his trusty lighter he soon realizes he is no longer at his friends house. He is now in some sort of dungeon which he believes is the result of his friends putting "some kind of psychotropic ♥♥♥♥" in his beer. Needless to say, not everyone will love the characters in this game. Their dialog isn't always the greatest, but this game is so full of references to other games that it mostly makes up for it. If that is your thing. The game has full voiceover for almost all of the dialog. Even inspecting most items in the game has voiceover and IMHO I think it's not too badly done. At least for most characters I've encountered so far. Not sure if any languages other than English has voiceover yet.\n\nThe gameplay consists of switching between different weapon types to deal with different types of enemies. Flesh targets are weaker against swords, armored targets weak against maces (also maces break barrels much faster than swords), daggers do extra damage from behind, thing like that. You can also use magic spells in this game that you find in the form of tomes around the castle. You first copy them to your spellbook then you can cast them using the different color essences of enemies you have defeated.\n\nPersonally I have really enjoyed this game so far. I got it on Steam sale but even the regular price is very fair for it in my opinion. There is a lot to do in this game and admittedly I haven't finished it yet. The castle is very large and as you progress through it you must also light all the torches in each of the rooms to fully light them up and be marked as explored on your map. I'm thoroughly enjoying my time in this game and am also enjoying the regular updates that have been coming out whlie this game was in early access. I would like to see another game from this developer.\n\nWill update review if anything changes by the time I finish it, but I don't really see that happening as I'm having a lot of fun with this game.\n\n8/10 - Fun Metroidvania with RPG elements and a pretty decent story.","July 28, 2014","true","6.7"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

I normally wait till I beat a game before I make any kind of review for it, but damn is this game good. It's a Metroidvania-style game with potion crafting, character stat leveling, spellcasting (haven't got up to this yet), environmental traps, and Diablo-like loot-drops (white, blue, yellow rarity items). The dialogue is very comical and has many references to other common games and movies, like Lord of the Rings and Warcraft 3.\n\nRight at the start, your character gets possessed by a wraith, but the possession fails, leaving the wraith to bug you for the rest of the game as an alternate conscience. This leads to plenty of good banter between the wraith and your character. There are save points in the game, just like Castlevania games. So, if you die, you will load back to your last save.

It's not quite easy, and you can always crank up the difficulty for added challenge (not even talking about the actual in-game challenges).  It's pretty nice looking especially with the system that makes you light rooms up.\n\nDon't let the Early access game deceive you either.

There's pletty of maps to choose from so the multiplayer doesn't end quickly but if you do complete the multiplayer, there is PVP and VS maps that you can test your might against other players which can bring in quite Epic deaths and kills.\n\nThere is some downsides I admit\nIt can feel Grindy\nIt can feel annoying at times while you die constently\nIt can cause fights\nBut in the end you will forget all your worries when you finally get all that loot you worked so hard for in your hands...\n\nOverall Its a awesome game that i feel that everyone can play, though some people will have a easier time than others.\n8.5/10 I would probable give this game if i could.","May 29, 2014","true","111.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I played this game a lot before buying it on Steam as well.\n\nCould not recommend this game more highly. It's a fun, well-designed, game that is easy to understand, simple to play and have a blast with, but challenging at the same time. Voice acting is nice, humor is great, but the dangers ar real... well, real for a video game. The interface is clean and logical and it plays and menu-navigates great with a 360 controller. A LOT of big studio's UI designers could learn a lot from this small, dedicated indie company out of Spain. Well done!\n\nAgain, if the trailer looks fun to you, buy it. There is a demo but the full version has better sound and visuals and play. Still the demo gives an accurate representation, at least enough to see how you like it. Totally worth the full price. Crazy good steal for less than that. Treat yourself and help a small developer that stands behind their game. Buy it. You'll enjoy it.\n\nHappy gaming,\nM13","June 18, 2015","true","0.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

This includes the spirit that has attempted to possess you and is now stuck in your body until your death. The plot isn't anything special, but it's enough to keep you going, and the witty humor really helps pull you along.\n\nAs for the gameplay, it's much like Castlevania (think SoTN), but with a much deeper rpg elements. You can choose to use magic, swords, axes, whatever you please. Each weapon type performs differently against the various enemies you encounter. The combat is simple in its execution and yet complex in the choices given. As far as content goes, there is a good amount to be had here. Not only is the dungeon given quite large, but this game has Steam workshop as well so that you may play other people's content if that's your kind of thing. Add all that with some multiplayer and you'll end up spending many hours on this game.\n\nOverall, I'd recommend this game. There's a lot of content and you can tell the developers really put their heart into it. This game is a steal for its price and if Metroidvania games are your thing you would be shooting yourself in the foot by not purchasing this.","May 8","true","5.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

Unepic is a fairly unconventional metroidvania-ish action RPG.\n\nThe mechanics are well thought-out, exploration is fun. The controls can be a bit counter-intuitive at first, but I got used to it. There are no ground breaking innovations, but there are some unique ideas that work well, such as the torch lighting mechanic. Every time you go to a new area, you wanna light the torches in the room to mark it "visited" and you can see enemies better.\n\nI liked the game much more than I expected.

What I mean by this is I really don't like the "feel" of your character... like jumping and attacking.   But it's a very immersive system that really takes a lot more into consideration than most side scroll games.  Inventory feels clunky at first also, but the more you see the engine can do, the more you grow to appriciate why it needs to be that way, and how being a little clunky really helps compliment the overall point of the game.  I've never considered a side scroll game to be like a paper and pencil role playing game, but this one does it (I don't mean the obvious humor thematic tie-in, but rather the mechanics, but they both compliment each other).  The game is imensly meta, which I'm not normally a fan of.  But my personal tastes aside, they do pull it off well.  If you are looking for something different, and enjoy learning different systems and differnt types of puzzles, then this is a very good game to check out.

I bought it because I wanted a really good metroidvania type game, and trust me that there is some great metroidvania content in here, but there are a few things about this game that just grated on my nerves too hard and soured what could have otherwise been a very positive experience.\n\nOVERALL:\nMap/exploration: 9/10\nItems/Loot: 8/10\nSecrets: 7/10\nCharacter Building: 9/10\nCombat: 5/10\nStory/Characters: 4/10\nHumor: 1/10\n\nPROS:Huge 2D metroidvania style map to explore\nLots of items to find (adds a D&D element to the metroidvania formula)\nLighting the torches in each room makes for a surprisingly fun gameplay hook\nBoss battles feel satisfying\nContains secrets (mostly behind secretly breakable walls)\nLots of sidequests and bonus challenges\nCONS:\n\nCOMBAT:\nThe ranged combat is decent (though not being able to aim more vertically to hit flying/floating enemies can be a slight annoyance), but the melee combat is an exercise in frustration. You won't understand how frustrating when you're first starting out and merely hacking slow, passive slugs to death. But once you start encountering toughter, faster, more aggressive enemies, that's when the problems begin to truly rear their heads. Here is a bulleted list of the issues I had with the combat. They are bad enough in isolation, but in aggregate they are even worse:\nEvery attack by every enemy inflicts knockback on you no matter what. Yet none of your attacks inflict knockback on any enemy ever. They are solid as a rock, while you are batted around like a cat's toy.\n\nEnemy attacks interrupt every action you take, whether it's swinging your weapon or drinking a potion. Your attacks can stun an enemy if they are not currently attacking, but your attacks do not interrupt enemy attacks.\n\nIf you are fighting a melee enemy, sword vs sword, you'll find that for some reason the protagonist swings much more slowly than most enemies, which further allows them to easily interrupt your attempts to attack them. Add the knockback and interrupt to this, and you're in for a real pisser.\n\nNine out of ten enemies in the game inflict a status effect on you if they hit you (poison, burning, frozen) and status effects stack, exponentially increasing the effect. Status effects are a key element of RPGs, but it's usually a little more rare.\nGiven all of the above, you'll find yourself trying to use tactics that avoid direct melee combat (e.g. backstabbing and ranged) specifically because the double standard on the knockback and interrupt is such a pain in the ♥♥♥♥ that it's frankly not fun nor cost effective to use direct melee. Add the enemies that explode in a huge blast radius when they die, insta-killing you or instantly inflicting 4x status effects, and you'll begin wondering why you even carry a sword in the first place.\n\nYou could, of course, drink yourself silly on health potions. But I feel like health potions are a thing you use to compensate for mistakes or missteps, not something you drink to damage sponge your way through knockback city.\n\n"HUMOR"\nOh yes, I am most definitely putting it in quotes. The protagonist you'll be forced to play in this game is the most annoying and repulsive tw*t you will ever meet. Prepare yourself for a lot of poop, fart, and d*ck jokes of the most childish and puerile kind. And don't get me wrong. I like childish humor and silliness as much as the next person. For example, South Park has a lot of jokes about poop, farts, and sex, but the difference is that South Park is actually funny. When UnEpic makes its poop, fart, and sex jokes, it feels like a literal third grader's attempt at humor. It wants very much to be a funny game with funny dialogue, but instead it just comes off as annoyingly immature. Even worse, the intolerable a*hole of a protagonist fancies himself the cleverest man on earth and insists on making "funny" quips at every juncture (while congratulating himself on his own brilliance, of course), meaning you'll have to listen to his "jokes" (or tediously tap the skip button) fairly regularly.\n\nMaybe I wouldn't mind the protagonist if he actually seemed like a character. Like if he actually seemed like just a character who was written to be puerile or written to be an arrogant, self-satisfied prick who you would rather punch in the face than speak to. But what makes the problem worse is that he's not a believable character, because he is so inconsistent. One second he's making a joke about how he just farted or whatever (real comedy gold); then the next minute he's asking a female NPC seven times in a row if she wants to have sex, telling her how horny he is, how hot she looks, commenting on her genitals or whatever; then the next minute he sees a plant and makes what he thinks is a clever joke about growing marijuana, etc. Then after all of that, a dialogue where he brilliantly outsmarts his demonic possessor with reverse psychology and an Odyssean wit. The end result is that he seems less like a cohesive character and more like a vessel into which so many painfully immature fantasies have been dumped.\n\nI might have thought this character was my kind of guy in the 7th grade, but I am a grown man. How am I ever supposed to beat this game when nothing makes me happier than killing this unlikable ♥♥♥♥ over and over again? He's the worst.","June 23, 2015","false","10.2"," 17 of 32 people (53%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","53","17","32","5","1"

You'll distribute skill points to specialize in various aspects of combat, whether you're using standard ranges or melee weapons, scrolls, potions, familiars or whatever. Progression is a bit uninspired in that it relies on you finding keys (as opposed to special jumping abilities and whatnot), but the combat keeps things fresh.\n\nThere's also an element of stealth to the game. You can sneak up on most enemy types, but that doesn't necessarily mean that they'll go down easily. Every so often, you'll happen upon a new enemy type that really throws you for a loop, especially given how numerous they can be at times. It's worth noting that the level design in this game really suits the enemy distribution well.","July 17, 2013","true","52.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DarkEsperX/recommended/233980/","DarkEsperX","FoXwithDabs","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DarkEsperX/","350 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nWow, I just finished Unepic's single player and I am blown away.  This review is just for single player.  I chose to play on hard mode to make it a little more similar to Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, one of my all time favorite games.  The difficulty progressed at a good rate and It proved to be a good challenge while not being so difficult that I lost interest.  I had to put the controller down a few times due to frustration but never more than a couple minutes and I always wanted to come back and beat that next boss or get past that next room.\n\nThe story was good and I enjoyed how the main character related to his situation.   I'm also happy to say the voice acting is well done, especially for the main characters.  They play their rolls very well and never feel like they are just reading off a script.  Wow, the end is really cool!  It had me worried for a second but overall came back with some laughs and I felt good with it.\n\nThe music was exceptional to me.  It looped very well and never got annoying while I was running around dissecting everything in my path, which also sounded great.  It felt completely in place for each area of the castle and was one of the main things that made this game bring back the nostalgia I have for Castlevania: SOTN on the PS1.  Other things like items falling on the ground, lighting torches, squishy enemies, and shooting waves of fire in front of you all sounded great.  I did encounter one bug where sometimes the background music would start playing more than once, creating kind of an echo.  This went away after getting in combat (because combat music took over) or going to a different area with different, or no, music and wasn't a huge issue.\n\nI'm a sucker for the 2D/3D style that Castlevania: SOTN is known for.  While I don't believe Unepic makes use of any 3D the shadows and lighting are excellent and do an amazing job at bringing depth to the game.  I like the style of the characters/enemies and the castle is a treat to wander through.  Everything is well animated and beautiful to look at if you enjoy this old school style.   One thing I really enjoyed was having to light the torches in every area.  It's a great touch that adds to the wonder and curiosity of exploring the castle while giving you that great accomplished feeling when the ringing sound plays from lighting the last torch in a section.\n\nI choose to play with my Xbox 360 controller which it detected and is set up perfectly for.  The game gives you 12 hotkeys for a controller setup which was enough although a couple times I wish I had one or two more.  Controls felt tight and responsive and I had no problem quickly navigating around the dungeon.  Targeting can be a little tough if there are a lot of enemies but I never felt like I couldn't get past an area because of it.\n\nThere are only 2 "bad" things I feel I need to mention.  First, there is a (4 screens) long room with glowing white orbs you have to avoid.  I found that the orbs will often hit you when they shouldn't as if the hit-box was ahead or behind the visual representation of the orb.  It was one of the most frustrating moments for me as I kept getting "hit" when I was more than an inch away from the orb which would take me back to my last save which meant in the middle of the castle because I was playing on hard and a bit of a run to get back there. Second I had originally planned to be a mostly melee character but I found by the end of the game I found I was using my bow almost exclusively.  The endgame feels like its designed only with long range attacks in mind so make sure you have something long range or its going to be very tough.\n\nOverall I would give this game a 9 out of 10.  Despite a few minor irritations the quality of the characters, graphics, gameplay, story, music and sounds is way above average and well worth the asking price.  I have a ton of great memories from playing through just the single player and it's one I will come back to every few years to play again and again just for that feeling of nostalgia.\n\nIf you're a fan of Castlevania style games then do yourself a favor and pick Unepic up.  If its on sale for less than 5 dollars, even if you're not sure about it, I'd strongly recommend giving it a go.  I think most people will thoroughly enjoy Unepic and what it offers and even if you don't it's only the cost of a coffee.\n\n","January 10, 2014","true","38.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you like that kind of game play, you should definitely check this game out.  The story starts out with a group of college guys playing a game of Dungeons&Dragons.  Daniel goes to the bathroom, and while there the lights go out and he suddenly finds himself in this castle.  And so the game begins! (Note that you do not need to be a Dungeons&Dragons person to enjoy this game; you just need to enjoy exploring dungeons.)\n\nI've already logged a handful of hours in the game and am enjoying it very much.  I've also played one of the multiplayer dungeons by myself and enjoyed that quite a bit also.  There are of course also boss battles too.\n\nThe game also has an editor so you can build your own custom dungeons, though I haven't played with it yet.\n\nI haven't had this game super long yet, but I'm loving it so far!","January 17, 2014","true","30.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's a story about Daniel, an old-school tabletop RPG player, who mysteriously finds himself in a medieval castle after going to the bathroom during a gaming session. Once he arrives there, he tries to figure out how he got there, and how he can return to his world.\n\nFor starters, the castle that Daniel has been teleported to is massive. If that wasn't bad enough, the castle is full of creatures and has seven guardians he must defeat before he can defeat the lord of the castle, Harnakon, and find a way to go home. While pursuing that goal, you can play Daniel however you want, and there is even a character sheet vaguely reminiscent of a Dungeons & Dragons character sheet that lets you build him however you would like. Want to be an axe-weilding barbarian? Or maybe a spellcaster is more to your liking? There are plenty of options to explore in this diverse game. But enough about story and character development, let's get to raw gameplay.\n\nThe game plays as a 2D Platformer and is actually very well designed. The levels are built in such a way that you could run through them accomplishing all your main objectives and still have loads of material to come back to later. It also features a gate system that leads to a travel hub for quicker transportation to locations that you have previously reached. Combat is well thought out and requires careful attention to small details, like status ailments, and leaves you completely in the dark as to whether most enemies are almost dead, as they lack a health bar. The games small amount of bosses are well-made and put up quite a struggle. These fights are few and far between, but make you feel rewarded when you beat one and have a shower of gold coins fall from the heavens.\n\nThe RPG aspect is heavily emphasized in UnEpic. There are frequent inner dialougues and dialogues with other characters like Zera, merchants, and all the random NPCs that you could ever want. There are quite a few funny conversations and references to other things like Star Wars, Futurama, and Lord of the Rings, just to name a few.\n\nThe game also has great multiplayer. There are Coop and Vs. game modes that you can play with your friends (or strangers) with characters you specifically create for online play. The cooperative campaign is completely different from the single-player campaign and follows the group playing an RPG instead of being IN an RPG.\n\nAll-in-All, I'm very satisfied that I bought this game and recommend it to any of my friends (or anyone else who likes what they've read).","January 21, 2014","true","32.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game manages to do something other "Human protagonist enters fantasy world" games don't: not trying at all.. the games is funny on his own and easy to understand.

I have just started unepic and can say first impressions are fantastic! I put the game into the highest difficulty right away for 2 reasons; every game I play that is rpg based I want it to be as hard as possible for challenge and longevity, and in this game it actually rewards you for being on the higher difficulty with more skill points!\n\nAside from that the first feature that made me go wow was the ability to open your map and write something in it for each "square" section. This may seem like a small feature to some but to any veteran rpg players this is HUGE! Why has this never been done before in a metroidvania type of game or any for that matter you may ask? If you did ask THERE WOULD BE NO ANSWER. The map function is actually what made me save, quit the game, and head straight to writing this review!\n\nReview Part 2 : So 12 hours into the game and can honestly say my opinion is still the same. The game is fun, plain and simple! Good gameplay, fun story, entertaining dialogue, and some original boss fights. Lots of small features in the game help to make it alot of fun, including lilghting all the torches in the castle, challenges that gain you UN currency which can be spent at the UN shop, and secrets galore! If you are on the edge about buying this game, get off it and do it already. When I purchased it the game was 2.49 it will probably be that way before the end of the summer sale and on every sale bi-anual sale at some point. Good luck!\n\nWill update with further opinions after more of the game is played but so far it is looking good!","June 22, 2014","true","33.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

It is a a RPG/platformer with well executed Metroidvania exploration. The game has a very entertaining and unique story that is complimented by superb voice-acting for nearly all of the dialogue. The interaction between the characters is very humorous and really keeps the game fresh and builds up the characters' relationships. Playing never got boring as there is always more of the castle to explore, weapons/spells/skills to experiment with and secrets to find. For a nearly 20 hours game, it's very impressive the game stays interesting. I was also thoroughly satisfied with how unique the ending of the game was handled and won't forget it anytime soon.\n\nI don't really have anything bad to say about the game, so I fully recommend this game, even at full price if you like this type of game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sarge22/recommended/233980/","Sarge22","The Sarge","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sarge22/","41 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThere aren't many games that make me want to start them over and over again until I get my character set-up just right, but UnEpic is one of them. This game is a blast from start to finish, and has that Metroidvania feel to it along with a dash of nerdy humor. There are plenty of tongue in cheek references from Space Balls to Futurama, Army of Darkness to Star Trek and Lord of the Rings. I love the opening scene too.\n\nGameplay itself is rock solid, with options for all styles of combat, from dagger to spell. The only thing I would add is a block function, as it can be annoying to have all these weapon and armor drops but still end up taking damage due to a mistimed step (especially against some of the Ghost Armor enemies later on in the game). The difficulty level isn't brutal, you just have to be on your toes and know what you are getting into from the gate. I recommend tinkering with it on Easy before making the leap to Hard or Hard+.\n\nCharacter customization is handled through a skill point system, much like any tabletop RPG would be. You can keep skill points as long as you like, and I recommend only really increasing your Constitution score until you figure out what style you want to use. You gain 5 points per level, though the Hard and Hard+ mode give you 6 or 7 respectfully. The game has a rock paper scissors feel to it, in that certain weapons are more useful against certain enemies, i.e. Hammers vs Skeletons and Blades vs Living creatures. You will still damage enemies, but there will be a noticable difference in how much damage you are dishing out against the wrong type. Eventually, given enough levels and higher end gear, you can use anything on anyone however.\n\nThe boss fights are huge spectacles that remind me of Super Metroid or Castelvania IV. Giant, screen-filling enemies serve as 'Guardians' to each area, and all have unique challenges and fighting styles that take getting used to. Learning through trial and error takes patience, and you'll get sick of the death music after a while, but the feeling of winning makes it all worth it.\n\nThere is also a challenge system which increases replay value dramatically. Challenges reward the player with UN coins/points, which carry over between characters and save files. These points are used to buy novelty items, unique weapons and a special orb that will allow you to redistribite your points one time (which you can also get via a quest, so technically, twice). I ran into an issue of losing all my unlocked but incomplete challenges when playing offline, and that is very frustrating. Once you unlock a challenge with a character, you cannot unlock it again, so I have to start a new file to get access to the ones I had listed but didn't finish. That's the biggest flaw I've found so far.\n\nI'd like a little more polish on this game before I'll call it a go to, as there are elements of the inventory which annoy me (not having the ability to manually arrange items, with a controller at least, being the biggest) and there are some vague quests that will end up with you having to shell out hard earned gold to get augury scrolls just to finish them (the search for the spirit's name springs to mind. I cleared that Library dozens of times until I figured out where it was). But the overall product is  well done, and with a few more revisions will be complete.\n\nThere is a multiplayer element, but I have yet to try it out, as the single player campaign is more than satisfying. I say give this game a shot, the worst you do is lose an hour or so on a weekend, and at best you find a suitable old school game to keep you coming back for more.","February 13, 2014","true","26.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Stylized and cartoony, they provide decent illustrations of the objects they represent.  My only complaint is that some objects don't occupy the same physical space the sprite does.

It's not long to reach the save spot and there's an item later that allows you to instantly teleport to it, so it's not too bad.\n\nAll in all, I'm happy with my purchase.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DarkEsperX/recommended/233980/","DarkEsperX","FoXwithDabs","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DarkEsperX/","350 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nWow, I just finished Unepic's single player and I am blown away.  This review is just for single player.  I chose to play on hard mode to make it a little more similar to Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, one of my all time favorite games.  The difficulty progressed at a good rate and It proved to be a good challenge while not being so difficult that I lost interest.  I had to put the controller down a few times due to frustration but never more than a couple minutes and I always wanted to come back and beat that next boss or get past that next room.\n\nThe story was good and I enjoyed how the main character related to his situation.   I'm also happy to say the voice acting is well done, especially for the main characters.  They play their rolls very well and never feel like they are just reading off a script.  Wow, the end is really cool!  It had me worried for a second but overall came back with some laughs and I felt good with it.\n\nThe music was exceptional to me.  It looped very well and never got annoying while I was running around dissecting everything in my path, which also sounded great.  It felt completely in place for each area of the castle and was one of the main things that made this game bring back the nostalgia I have for Castlevania: SOTN on the PS1.  Other things like items falling on the ground, lighting torches, squishy enemies, and shooting waves of fire in front of you all sounded great.  I did encounter one bug where sometimes the background music would start playing more than once, creating kind of an echo.  This went away after getting in combat (because combat music took over) or going to a different area with different, or no, music and wasn't a huge issue.\n\nI'm a sucker for the 2D/3D style that Castlevania: SOTN is known for.  While I don't believe Unepic makes use of any 3D the shadows and lighting are excellent and do an amazing job at bringing depth to the game.  I like the style of the characters/enemies and the castle is a treat to wander through.  Everything is well animated and beautiful to look at if you enjoy this old school style.   One thing I really enjoyed was having to light the torches in every area.  It's a great touch that adds to the wonder and curiosity of exploring the castle while giving you that great accomplished feeling when the ringing sound plays from lighting the last torch in a section.\n\nI choose to play with my Xbox 360 controller which it detected and is set up perfectly for.  The game gives you 12 hotkeys for a controller setup which was enough although a couple times I wish I had one or two more.  Controls felt tight and responsive and I had no problem quickly navigating around the dungeon.  Targeting can be a little tough if there are a lot of enemies but I never felt like I couldn't get past an area because of it.\n\nThere are only 2 "bad" things I feel I need to mention.  First, there is a (4 screens) long room with glowing white orbs you have to avoid.  I found that the orbs will often hit you when they shouldn't as if the hit-box was ahead or behind the visual representation of the orb.  It was one of the most frustrating moments for me as I kept getting "hit" when I was more than an inch away from the orb which would take me back to my last save which meant in the middle of the castle because I was playing on hard and a bit of a run to get back there. Second I had originally planned to be a mostly melee character but I found by the end of the game I found I was using my bow almost exclusively.  The endgame feels like its designed only with long range attacks in mind so make sure you have something long range or its going to be very tough.\n\nOverall I would give this game a 9 out of 10.  Despite a few minor irritations the quality of the characters, graphics, gameplay, story, music and sounds is way above average and well worth the asking price.  I have a ton of great memories from playing through just the single player and it's one I will come back to every few years to play again and again just for that feeling of nostalgia.\n\nIf you're a fan of Castlevania style games then do yourself a favor and pick Unepic up.  If its on sale for less than 5 dollars, even if you're not sure about it, I'd strongly recommend giving it a go.  I think most people will thoroughly enjoy Unepic and what it offers and even if you don't it's only the cost of a coffee.\n\n","January 10, 2014","true","38.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you like that kind of game play, you should definitely check this game out.  The story starts out with a group of college guys playing a game of Dungeons&Dragons.  Daniel goes to the bathroom, and while there the lights go out and he suddenly finds himself in this castle.  And so the game begins! (Note that you do not need to be a Dungeons&Dragons person to enjoy this game; you just need to enjoy exploring dungeons.)\n\nI've already logged a handful of hours in the game and am enjoying it very much.  I've also played one of the multiplayer dungeons by myself and enjoyed that quite a bit also.  There are of course also boss battles too.\n\nThe game also has an editor so you can build your own custom dungeons, though I haven't played with it yet.\n\nI haven't had this game super long yet, but I'm loving it so far!","January 17, 2014","true","30.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The gameplay is simple hack'n'slash / spellcasting fare with a lot of traps and monsters to make sure you dont spend too much time alive. The dialogue can be a bit of a mixed bag with some of the jokes being absolutely UnFunny. That being said, I found the main storyline to be quite engrossing. The dialogue between Daniel and Zera is awesome. As the story goes on, you realize that Daniel has a mature side and Zera isnt as perfect as he claims to be.\n\nThis game really does so many things right. If you're into Metroidvanias and dont mind some terrible humor, you should certainly look into purchasing this game.","May 18, 2014","true","53.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's a story about Daniel, an old-school tabletop RPG player, who mysteriously finds himself in a medieval castle after going to the bathroom during a gaming session. Once he arrives there, he tries to figure out how he got there, and how he can return to his world.\n\nFor starters, the castle that Daniel has been teleported to is massive. If that wasn't bad enough, the castle is full of creatures and has seven guardians he must defeat before he can defeat the lord of the castle, Harnakon, and find a way to go home. While pursuing that goal, you can play Daniel however you want, and there is even a character sheet vaguely reminiscent of a Dungeons & Dragons character sheet that lets you build him however you would like. Want to be an axe-weilding barbarian? Or maybe a spellcaster is more to your liking? There are plenty of options to explore in this diverse game. But enough about story and character development, let's get to raw gameplay.\n\nThe game plays as a 2D Platformer and is actually very well designed. The levels are built in such a way that you could run through them accomplishing all your main objectives and still have loads of material to come back to later. It also features a gate system that leads to a travel hub for quicker transportation to locations that you have previously reached. Combat is well thought out and requires careful attention to small details, like status ailments, and leaves you completely in the dark as to whether most enemies are almost dead, as they lack a health bar. The games small amount of bosses are well-made and put up quite a struggle. These fights are few and far between, but make you feel rewarded when you beat one and have a shower of gold coins fall from the heavens.\n\nThe RPG aspect is heavily emphasized in UnEpic. There are frequent inner dialougues and dialogues with other characters like Zera, merchants, and all the random NPCs that you could ever want. There are quite a few funny conversations and references to other things like Star Wars, Futurama, and Lord of the Rings, just to name a few.\n\nThe game also has great multiplayer. There are Coop and Vs. game modes that you can play with your friends (or strangers) with characters you specifically create for online play. The cooperative campaign is completely different from the single-player campaign and follows the group playing an RPG instead of being IN an RPG.\n\nAll-in-All, I'm very satisfied that I bought this game and recommend it to any of my friends (or anyone else who likes what they've read).","January 21, 2014","true","32.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Currently there is just a checkbox for making it widescreen friendly\nachievements, most of the achievements are awesome except gaining 5,000 or 10,000 kills in one round. While on an average gameplay you reach 4,000 kills it feels like ridiculous grinding ... especially, when the kill-count does not summarize the kills from all characters you played.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/slowacki/recommended/233980/","slowacki","Slowacki","http://steamcommunity.com/id/slowacki/","1605 products in account","UnEpic is a brilliant (not so) little indie game. We accompany a real-life 'nerd' that gets sucked into a castle full of traps and hostile creatures, trying to find his way out of the 'hallucination', he gets possessed, by one of the guardians of the castle, which doesn't really go too well for both of them. And this where the fun begins.\n\nThe whole game is kept in a comedic setting, which is upheld mainly by the witty dialogues (monologues?) between the 'hero' and the spirit. There are lots of references and parodies of different fantasy and science-fiction films throughout the gameplay. The story, even though fairly simple, is actually quite interesting and I caught myself wondering 'how will this end?' many time when playing. However, on several occassions, the humour was just too low and a bit cringeworthy (most notably, 'a dream come true' quest, argh!). Apart from that, seeing the two main characters, argue or make fools of one another was really enjoyable.\n\nAs for the game itself, I was surprised by the sheer amount of possibilities to build your character. One is given plenty of tools to do the job right and can just pick the ones that suit him the most. I rarely replay games, but I'm sure I could play UnEpic again, levelling my character in a totally different way and would still succeed. The game doesn't hold one by his hand too much, so sometimes a little thinking is required, when trying to complete some quests. That said, there are scrolls sold by one merchant in the game that will point you out directly to the places you need to go, if someone would get stuck and wouldn't like to search for the answers in the Internet.\n\nMechanically, the game was ok. The character response to pressing buttons felt a bit weird at first, but I got used to it fairly quick and it didn't bother me at all for the rest of the time. I think, the feeling of unresponsiveness was mainly caused by the fact that the attack animations are somewhat long and that makes attacking and dodging harder. That said, this is not a trick jump, button mashing game, so it's not THAT important. In most cases, the strategy of beating a room/boss is much more important than the execution of it.\n\nAs I've already mentioned bosses, UnEpic features some really enjoyable boss fights. Every boss requires a different tactics, which you have to work out in few tries usually. And that is usually enough to beat every boss, except one, which I didn't really like, who is really annoying and requires you to, actually, throw away most of your stuff from the inventory or face death. Apart from that one fight, the others are really great and fulfilling.\n\nThe graphics and music (was there even music?) is a totally different story and this is where the 'Indie' shows. I really can't tell if there was music in the game, if there was, I turned it off almost instantly and used my own playlists for the background soundtrack. On the other hand, the voicing is on a decent level, the characters sounded as one could think judging by how they were depicted. The graphics is, well, not so good, so this might be a chokepoint for some players, who look for some high-budget, 3d, flashy backgrounds and animations. Some enemies/bosses look a bit kitschy, but to be honest, the gameplay and the way story goes makes up for that totally.\n\nI've encountered few bugs and crashes, nothing too serious though. Two most annoying were stucking movement and automatic resolution changes. The first one appeared several times to me and even got me killed once or twice, the second one was a bit weird and might have been caused by me pressing some hidden key combination (no idea, couldn't find anything) and was resolved by exiting and entering the saved game. Not sure if others also got those, or is it me doing something wrong. Anyway, nothing too groundbreaking and spoiling the fun too much.\n\nAll in all, I really do recommend UnEpic, even at the full price. It is a really fine mix of witty dialogues, crude and/or intelligent humour, movie references, difficulty level and boss fights. What's more, it gives you about 15h+ of gameplay (medium difficulty, all quests), which is a fair amount of time, not too much and definitely not too little. So, if you're on the fence about buying UnEpic, take my word and get it, it's worth it.\n\nP.S. Wow, the ending is really cool!","August 11, 2015","true","21.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Breakable walls that are completely hidden.

Never the less, despite the many deaths the game has kept us laughing and working together.\n\nMy biggest problem with the game are the glitches that prevent you from doing what the game wants you to do, such as lag issues starting you in danger of the next map, and the inability to toggle the targeting feature on or off which we have yet to figure out the cause.\n\nDespite that the game is a blast, we love the references and are enjoying the game quite a bit.","October 5, 2014","true","29.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

This game is sooo freaking good! i rarely buy Early access games but i recommend this to everyone who likes Metroidvania RPG Games.. For an early access game they have the next things\nHumor/funny text and events! Good story line! Good quests! IN-GAME VOICE TEXT DIALOGUE (So the text that they will be saying will also be said in voice acting), More difficulties! Multiplayer! soundtrack is nice. It even breaks the 3rd wall sometimes!

When you start out everything is great and so much fun but the further you get the more some of the mechanics just rub you the wrong way.  The combat is responsive for the most part and the castle itself was fun to explore, the best part in my opinion. The characters will not be everyone’s cup of tea but overall fun to listen to and see how they develop. Also the story itself was pretty solid.\n\nI would recommend getting this game but don’t feel the need to complete it, especially on the higher difficulties. The payoff is not worth the effort and the keyword for a lot of the game is frustration.\n\nHave fun ^_^","July 27, 2014","true","37.5"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

If Dark Souls were a 2D platformer, it would probably feel similar. The difficulty on UnEpic is satisfactory and the element of surprise is always welcome, not to mention the amazing gear progression, skills, spells, potion recipes, character sheet and the unique realistic sense of humor found on both single and multiplayer campaings - the multiplayer being even more fun. Controller support needs minor improvements (like in game map support and multiplayer lobby tweaking), but despite that this is a must play to RPG lovers!","September 24, 2014","true","36.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I am not a professional video game reviewer.  I am not a professional journalist or writer.  I play and review games because I am a gamer and I enjoy doing so.  My opinons are just that, opinons.  Just because I like and recommend a purchase does not mean you have to agree with all or any of what I have said.  Please consider this while reading this review.  The goal is to share my personal opinions of a game, because I enjoy doing so, and in turn if it helps someone with their decision to purchase, then that is wonderful.\n[/g]\n\nReview\nThis is another one of those ones that started popping up all over Youtube, and as usual I had to check it out.\n\nLet me tell you I was not disappointed.   If you go into this knowing what you are going into, which is a funny, 2d side scrolling platformer with decent gameplay and some RPG elements, then you will enjoy this game.  You might think it is a simplistic game with a short play time.  While is it simplistic overal in how it plays, it is actually quite a bit deep with it's rpg elements.\n\nThe dialogue is clever and enjoyable, and almost always funny.  The gameplay is smooth and plays as you would expect and is easy to pick up.  The experience of unlocking each portion of a map before moving on (Similar to some older Castlevania games or Zelda) is spot on, and it does provide some challenge.  I was also pleasantly surprised at the amount of hours it took to finish this game.  I figured a game of it's type I would finish in around 10-15 hours, but when I finished the game I noticed I had 30 hours into it.  So 30 hours without even noticing, that is absolutely terrific.\n\nI definitely recommend purchasing this game for it's high value and low cost.\n\nPros\n- Hilarious\n- Great Gameplay\n- Fun RPG elements\n- Decent Soundtrack\n- Good length\n\nCons\n- Some possibly furstrating moments (for some?)\n- None!","December 21, 2013","true","31.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It really helped set in the immersion of the setting than text reading back then.\n\nThe story is alright, has a plot hole or two in it, and is sorta put to pause in some parts of the game, but it's good half way in before it becomes a bit non-exsistent for awhile.\n\nGameplay is smooth, gives you many different ways to play it and what "class" you want to play as with a few alterations to help progress.\n\nI'd say this is a pre-dark souls difficulty game, especially at hard++ mode, basically to warm players up for dark souls difficulty of gameplay, if they plan on playing it. It is difficult at first, especially if you don't know what to expect and if there's any work arounds you need to make that you didn't plan to begin with. Only tip I can give is, don't rush through any scrolls or potions you find. Scrolls and some potions are a one-time find per playthrough and should only be used if necessary. Don't rush in spending your points either. You may end up putting too much points in a stat than you needed. Some spells are situational only, same with weapon skills, that you really need to think if you want to invest points, and money, in.\n\nThe game itself has A LOT of referances that geeks and nerds will notice more than others, some are obvious some are over the head. There's only a few I got, the rest I don't get or aware of.\n\nThe only thing I don't like is that the quotes and voices for discovering a challenge is a one-time thing, ever, meaning if you found any before voices were added, you had to dig in the Unepic fold and find the voice files that says the quotes and they are indeed amazing quotes that need to be heard/read again. I wish you could rediscover them, but don't plan to re-do half of them.\n\n(Thread here for the quotes and what they relate to, but not give locations of them.)\n\nI don't have anything to say for multiplayer as I've hardly touch that...","January 25, 2015","true","156.6"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The game is set in a castle located in an unknown land, you as Daniel, an every day person find yourself transported to it while taking a ♥♥♥♥ in the middle of a Dungeons and Dragons games with some friends. Believing the entire thing is a hallucination, Daniel presses into the castle full of dangers unaware that what is happening is more than he expected.\n\nUnEpic is a metroidvania that resembles that of the old school castlevania games, the castle is full of secrets and dangerous traps. All of which won't hesistate to laugh at your misfortune. It also a great sense of humour (or terrible but very well done depending on your view on it) which will at least cause you to smile, despite the game being full of comedic references it still manages to maintain a serious atmosphere and the puzzles for each quest is cleverly done and forces you to think outside the box rather then blindly run in and complete the quests with no problems, you can always a expect a twist.\n\nOverall the game is great fun, the combat mechanics are great if not a little clunky but once you get used to it you start to enjoy bowling through waves of enemies. The game will be difficult for first time players but the challenge is part of the charm to UnEpic. The Multiplayer is also a completely different thing from the Single Player so either way, alone or with friends. You won't get bored of what UnEpic has to offer until you've ran through it a couple times.\n\nThis is one quest you won't forget, because it certainly is "UnEpic".","January 17, 2014","true","57.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

But every once in while, you'll find a gem like unepic. Both Single Player and Multiplayer modes are fantastic and addictive. The single player story is very entertaining, with hilarious references and mystery. The multiplayer mode is fantastic as well because it gives you the feeling that you're playing DnD with you friends, and is especially fun if you wish you knew how to play DnD but don't feel like learning (like me).\n\nSo if you're someone like me who prefers 3D Action/RPG games like me, a platformer like this may not look too appealing to you. But trust me on this one: You won't regret it.","June 27, 2014","true","51.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Pingstery/recommended/233980/","Pingstery","Pingster - Play ToS with me!","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Pingstery/","87 products in account","Wow, the end is really cool!\n\nWith roughly 30 hours of content (give or take, depending what's your approach on challenges/achievements), the single player is really captivating and interesting. The "Deadpool" approach of 4th wall being constantly broken (the nature of the game, not a spoiler!) works surprisingly well.\n\nThe game plays excellently with a controller (did not try keyboard at all, so can't comment on that), the combat works really well (the only issue is targeting - you lose target if you take damage, and it does not remember last target, so at a certain point in game it's a bit spammy - however, you do not need targeting for 90% of the game, so it's fine) and there's definitely enough reason to replay it (various endings and character builds).\n\nMy only complaint would be that it's a little too melee/ranged focused in the beginning of the game, so by the time you get to a point where a mage build would be viable, you're already 10 feet deep into building your character for melee or range. Can't really experience a mage build until either second play-through by going out of your way to neglect building your character for a while, or by resetting your stats (which, word of warning, you only get one free chance at, so save up some money for spells, robes and staves if you plan to make use of it).\n\nOverall, a great game, and I strongly suggest it to anyone who's interested in Castlevania style side scrollers.\n\nTime to try the multiplayer aspect of it with a friend of mine, will edit this in the future if it's necessary to.\n\nEdit for Multiplayer:\n\nYeah, no, don't, just don't, and whatever you do, make sure that's not something you'd try first. Between the consistant lag that reduces the playability to near zero for almost everyone in the party and the lack of entertainment you get off the main game, it's just not worth it. Multiplayer doesn't feel like UnEpic, it feels like just a random, rather ♥♥♥♥♥♥, dungeon explorer game. Thought this might be something to play with a friend, but no, just don't.

Unfortunately, the difficulty isn't game challenges, puzzles, traps, or enemies.  No, you fight with the game's deliberate design. The game has no replay value, yet success requires that you make all of your important decisions upfront. Did you take frost?  No? The room with a dozen fire-helms will one-shot you 25 times over while you try to whittle them down, destroying your gear, making it impossible to complete the level.  Did you take Axes?  Too bad - the game drops you a dagger.  You can't respec, except too late and at great expense - requiring tedious grinds through completed dungeons, a process you repeat if your new spec doesn't deliver. Annoyingly, clearly a GREAT DEAL of developer time has gone into preventing cheating, even though it's not a competetive game. If only the time had been spent making the game better...","April 3, 2015","false","47.3"," 85 of 174 people (49%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","49","85","174","9","5"

The graphics and effects are pretty nice and it controls well. The inventory system is easily sortable with the press of a button which is a great feature. The UI is set up very nicely and is easy to understand. There are plenty of weapons, scrolls, potions, and what not to find and craft, and even a rpg skill advancement system. The enemies are all pretty standard dungeon fair like bats and skeletons. So far it has been a above average dungeon crawler. Much better than a game that looks very similar (graphics-wise) like Hammerwatch because you don't have to relentlessly hammer the attack button a thousand times a minute.\nOne thing that really sucks are the nearly impossible challenges but thankfully they are not required. I did the one where you stay off the ground and ladders for 18 seconds after about an hour of fails. But the boulder dodge for 60 seconds challenge is nearly impossible because of how randomly they fall and I sat there for probably 2-3 hours over a period of two days until I got it by pure luck. Needless to say I could care less about any more challenges.\n\n7/10 Decent enough for a fun once-through but not beyond that.

The combat is so stiff and boxy that most of the time you end up just hurting yourself on the opponent. You can't aim bows, jumping and moving at the same time is a joke and the controls are a mess until you tweak them to 180 from what the developers set. If this game had controls like Rogue Legacy it would actually be quite amazing. Unpolished, featureless game. There are a lot of great ideas and concepts behind ugly implementation and bad, poor design choices uneven gameplay, pace and difficulty. It feels like an indie debut from a very young developer due to vulgar jokes here and there.

I still cant bring myself to thmb it down though.\n\nPros:\n\nGreat idea for a story and very engaging at that.\n\nFunny characters and great character development\n\n"edgey" sense of humour that got a few laughs from me.\n\nNice leveling system and combat system\n\n\nCons:\n\nThere are multiple parts to this game that will make you want to quit and possibly actually make you. (As I eventually did) ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t boss battles that require certain stats to be leveled into. For instance there is one boss who is immune to magic and bows and can only be harmed physically. He also wastes all your potions and uses your teleport scrolls to ruin your day. There is another boss who is impossible to even hit with melee and you are forced to etiher be a decent level in bows or offensive magic. Later there are INVISABLE enemies that can only be harmed with light magic and steal your equipment if they touch you (and use it agaisnt you)\n\nThe game is just so damn frustrating the longer you play. I like challenging gameplay without it being broken and Unepic just comes off as broken.\n\nMagic, as with most games, is neglected until late game. This means if you really want to play a magic user you have to use bows/melee untill late game. You also have a limit to magic by way of essence that youll have to farm if you end up using magic as a main source of damage.\n\nThere is a arbitrary 3 different endings you choose by opening 3 random chests torwards the end. These change the final cutscene you get and dont really have any effect on the story but to see all three you would have to play the game to completion three times since there is no manual saves to create back up saves. Of course the alternative is using youtube which is what I did.\n\n-------\n\nThis game could have been outstanding. They just made some strange design choices that make the game more frustrating than enjoyable. Its a shame but hopefully this can be fixed and improved upon if they plan on doing another. I recommend this game with a BIG * next to it. Only get it if you are a fan of metroidvania type games and if you enjoy lewd humour.","September 29, 2014","true","19.2"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FFIXMaster/recommended/233980/","FFIXMaster","FFIXMaster","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FFIXMaster/","351 products in account","I cannot in good conscience recommend this game to any but the most desperate of Metroidvania fans.\n\nThe "humour" is constant and everywhere, which can be good if it aligns with your own sense of humour, or can be insipid and irritating if it does not.  Do you like juvenile díck jokes? Juvenile drug jokes? An a-hole main character with little to no redeeming qualities besides making díck and/or drug jokes? A contrived "I must be tripping/dreaming" denial that goes on for way, way too long? If you answered no to any of the above, I implore you to stay away, because those are honestly the best qualities this game has to offer.  (vvv more below vvv)\n\nThe (English) voice acting is generally passable, though there are a few times you can tell the VAs weren't given proper direction because they'll pronounce the same word differently in the same conversation with each other, and there are a couple points where the production quality was lacking and it almost sounded like a fan dub. Overall it's not too bad, though.\n\nThe actual gameplay, however, is where the game seriously starts falling apart; the controls are a bit stiff and take some getting used to (jumps are not adjustable at all; you will always jump exactly the same height and distance, making platforming sections either painfully boring or painfully difficult dependent entirely on whether the developer decided to give you their standard half-body-length margin of error or cut it down to pixel-perfect); the combat is slow and boring, despite there being many weapon types (they all feel pretty much the same--attack speed, range, even animations--making the game way more about raw stat values than personal play style preferences, and making you wonder why the game forces you to choose a weapon group to spend points in to raise your proficiency when it all seems so arbitrary, especially when the game throws out the window any sort of sense it had been making before, when it starts giving you daggers that are stronger than axes of comparable level); enemies, while having many different appearances, tend to fall into very general categories (runs-at-you, shoots-at-you, doesn't-move-at-all, or ignores-you-and-patrols), making the already slow and boring combat now also tedious; boss encounters are incredibly boring, having very basic attack patterns you learn in just a couple seconds and essentially being damage sponges with unfair expectations of positioning using the stiff and monotonous jumps to avoid 30%+ attacks.\n\nNow I know what you're thinking, if the story and combat aren't very good, then the exploration and level design must be, right? Because otherwise what's the point of a Metroidvania game?  I'm sorry, but the exploration is equally dumb and boring; along with jumps that never change you get movement speed that never changes (regardless of whether you're wearing light, medium or heavy armour) and zero movement-based abilities (no sprints, no walking, no lunges, no ripostes, no dodges, no double-jumps, no floats to slow descent and give you a way to reach a far-off platform, nothing)... So, what stops you from just going to the end of the game right from the beginning? Locked doors, which you get the keys to by beating bosses. That's it.  Sure, this is essentially the same thing as blocking off the next section of the castle by a double-jump-height platform, but those extra ways of navigating are what opens up level design possibilities, letting you hide powerups or items in early areas behind things you can't get by until later, letting you spice up later zones with different layouts than earlier ones because now you can move in all sorts of new and interesting ways, but this game doesn't have any of that.  Once you unlock a door to a new section of castle, you can fully-explore that section right now, meaning the only reason to ever enter a previously-beaten section of castle is if there's another locked door in it to get to another boss that holds another key for another locked door somewhere else.\n\nAnd I'm not even going to get into the absurdity of the leveling system this game has, where every level you're given a set number of points you can use to increase attributes, with the only respec option being incredibly costly and late-game, and things not even being shown as possible options until you unlock them.  Meaning at level 8, after you've already invested seven levels of points into different stats and you have a plan for how to distribute your stuff for the rest of the game, you're given a whole new stat that you'll suddenly need to put points into.  And that happens multiple times throughout the game.\n\nI have really been nothing but disappointed with this game.","May 2, 2015","false","16.7"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/whitetigershiro/recommended/233980/","whitetigershiro","Shiro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/whitetigershiro/","450 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nUnEpic starts with you sitting with some friends playing some D&D, when you announce that you need to use the restroom.  While in the bathroom, the lights go out, and upon lighting your lighter, you find yourself in a dark castle corridor.  Thus is the setting of UnEpic's story;  an ongoing question of whether this is all going on in your character's head (he assume's his friends slipped drugs in his beer) or if you've actually been teleported somewhere else.  How that story resolves, however, shall likely remain a mystery to this writer, as sadly, UnEpic is exactly that.\n\nThe gameplay uses the tried-and-true "Metroidvania" formula to present you with a side-scrolling Action/RPG where you can choose to be any number of character "classes" by way of which weapons, armor and spells you prefer to upgrade; though if you chose anything other than a potion-making Warrior with only a slight dabbling of magic, you chose poorly and will likely have a very hard game ahead of you.  And thus enters the very first problem with UnEpic, even if you know how you want to play the game, it doesn't matter unless your choice meshes with the design of the game.  The game sort of makes-up for this by offering a quest that gives you a reset of your spent skill points roughly halfway through the game, but even that reeks of too little, too late in this pseudo-difficulty-based game.\n\nJust what do I mean by that?  When I say "pseudo-difficulty" I'm generally referring to the practice of making a game artificially harder by testing the player's patience rather than by testing the player's skill.  In this game, it comes in the form of every section of the dungeon having it's own hurdle to deal with.  Whether you're in the Catacombs where the game floods you with enemies (of whom you can only hit one at a time while the others are free to swing at you freely), or in the Halls where the majority of enemies take zero recoil and deal massive damage with their attacks, there isn't a single area in UnEpic that was a joy to explore and conquer.  Rather the game felt more like a slog.\n\nThe only reason I made it as far as I did in the game is because I wanted to at LEAST beat the game; but I can't do it.  It's not for anything actually "hard", so-much as I just got sick of dealing with all the hurdles.  There's a fun game buried somewhere in all of that code, but sadly the developers don't know how to bring it out.  They were so hell-bent on making the game "harder", without actually knowing how to make a game challenging, that they've buried whatever fun might be had with UnEpic under a landslide of bothersome gameplay and bosses that often feel more like battles of attrition than actual tests of skill.","January 12, 2014","false","24.4"," 70 of 146 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","70","146","0","3"

The game has many hours of game play which is a plus but a lot of those are spent trying to figure out where you're going or back tracking to level up to do the next part. This game seems to punish those who want to 'figure it out as they go' in terms of stats, you'll find yourself quite hamstrung if you didn't pick a focus and tried to go all around with your points. There also isn't a good variety when it comes to the best weapons and unless you're psychic knowing what you'll find first and last so you can specialize in time is daunting. To add fat to the fire, if you decide you'd like to cheat (for sake of getting through the story and not having to stress over points) your character just dies. The developer is very against it. For me that's a deal breaker, it might not be for you.","February 10, 2015","false","4.1"," 6 of 15 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","6","15","0","0"

(resulting in many irritating misses that a skilled player with manual aim could avoid) The auto-targeting system also makes it extremely difficult to get the desired target. This makes that difficult "final dungeon" I talked about an absolute nightmare, because there are monsters that have a circular pattern, effectively defeating auto-aim and forcing you to find very narrow attack windows while the clock is ticking.\n\nI don't mind difficult, but it needs to be fair to the player and polish what needs polishing.

Controls are the chief issue: they're floaty and slow. This matches the snail-strapped-to-an-anvil pace of the game pretty well, but makes each death due to boring mechanical challenges that much more dull. (Dodge the rocks! Now do it again! And again! And now do it all again for achievement point currency! Traps! You like traps? How about traps that randomly respond differently? Will the spear trap hit you if you stand on the edge of the button, or not? Who knows! How exciting! Have fun Haloing back to the save point and slowly walking all the way back! Want to hop off that ladder onto the nearby ledge? Good luck, chum! Want to duck? Too bad, there's a ladder, down you go! Want to jump? I just told you about ladders, bro! I told you!)\n\nThere rapidly comes a point where you recognize exactly what you need to do to get to where you need to be, but no longer have any interest in progressing because of how tedious it is. Throw in janky melee combat and a far-too-limited RPG mechanics system, and you end up with something... well, you can't say the title didn't warn you.\n\nMuch of the game can be summed up by one of the opening scenes: there's obviously cursed gold lying around. You can pick it up, if you want. If you do, you do not fight a demon, or invoke a penalty, or trigger some wacky conversation halfway on into the game. You just slowly die, without the ability to drop the gold because the game hasn't given you the ability to put things down yet. And then you go all the way back to the start of the game. It's not unfair, it's just dull, and more interested in punishing the player with boredom than being exciting.\n\nOn the plus side: the writing is a potential strength, if you like reference humor. Most people seem to. Voice acting isn't the worst. Some lines aren't voiced, apparently at random, but most of it is, and it's done with decent quality (though the main character sounds fittingly like a nerd). Big plus: you can wear eight rings. That is two to four times as many as most RPGs allow, and accessory slots are like crack for RPG players. The game can be cute - as in, "nearly clever" - fairly often. The graphics are excellent for the genre, and I quite like how lighting is handled. The hotkeys are not at all bad, either, and the menu navigation is a breeze. It really comes down to the controls, I found: if they were a bit better, the game would be much better.\n\nUltimately, this just wasn't the action-dungeoncrawler I was looking for.","December 19, 2015","false","1.5"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","1"

It's a shame the game itself, is mediocre. Mostly, the gameplay feels sluggish and slow, and the balance is off, as in, enemies have too much health points, and just become sponges to keep attacking, with which either you die first, or they do. Another problem is in multiplayer. Enemies do not scale to players. So a 4 player map is unfinishable as a 2 player, unless you are far overleveled / equiped.\n\nAnother thing is it's constant comparison to castlevania, but having played that series exentisvely, I can say this can not even close to compare. Even the earlier parts in the castlevania series are faster paced, with nicer feeling controls. Compared to later parts in the castlevania series, this entirely falls flat on it's face in the comparison. Don't get fooled that this will give you a castlevania experience.\n\nProbably, if this guy remade the engine, and make it a faster paced, more balanced enemies, and could still retain the same community, it could be great.

If you've spec'ed a melee character...\n- A boss that randomly teleports you back to the central save point, forcing you to navigate back. Great thanks, real fun.\n- A status affliction that lasts 30+ seconds and causes you to constantly drop whatever weapon you're holding\n- Enemies that transform your weapon into a piece of junk, with a prohibitively high cost to change it back\n- Invisible enemies that can only be seen with a limited resource potion (unless you've spec'ed into potions).\n- Those same invisible enemies steal your weapons, so even if you wanted to just run past them, you're forced to fight them\n\nI put up with all of that garbage and more until I got to the final "boss", which was just the stupidest ♥♥♥♥ in the world.

The Single Player campaign has voice acting, potion crafting, stores, and item binds. If this game is on sale and you only want to play SP, it seems fine.\n\nThe multiplayer is an atrocity.\nThe very first level has countless BM instakill traps, mitigated at least, by the only penalty to death being respawning at your last checkpoint (which may be uneven with your teammates' due to the coffin system), then running all the way back. It also has a part where you must use the knowledge they NEVER SO MUCH AS HINTED AT that some walls vanish when struck, a boss that will surely kill you if allowed to get off its one attack, which it likely will unless you take the battle at a dreadful grind, and a lesson that in MP, all of your restorative items vanish between dungeons.\n\nMP also made much more clear and frustrating a couple of overarcing issues present in Single Player. First of all, the weapons are NOT equal. Axes are pretty useless, which made it a problem when, while attempting to type, my friend permanently put all of his points from levelling up into axes. No confirmation, no undoing, no respec until much later in the game. Use axes or waste the points.\n\nMultiplayer is just miserible. The level design is atrocious, a single misspec is easy to make and ludicrously difficult to repair, and at high levels your top-tier gear can be easily permanently destroyed or stolen.","April 23, 2015","false","5.0"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","3","10","0","0"

Not if you like to play your game, your way.\n\nUnEpic is a game which has made some design decisions I disagree with intensely. For example, you only get the most skill-points on level-up when you're playing on the super-hard game mode, which among other things actually disables the autosave, making it entirely possible for one keyboard mistake to cost you two hours of your life. But without those two extra skill points per level, you're always going to be hurting for skill points, lacking in enough points to do what you want to do.\n\nSo, I tried to do what I always do: bust out CheatEngine and give myself enough skill points to where I felt comfortable playing. Only then, however, did I realize that owing to early whining about cheating on the forums, the dev has instituted absolutely draconian anti-cheating measures that will wipe out your save games, and cooked them into both singleplayer and multiplayer, rather than, say, going with VAC, or instituting a system in which your client determines if you're playing with a cheater and allowing you to make the decision to not play with them or to continue to play with them.\n\nSo, is UnEpic worth it? Not if you like to play by your own rules. Not if you want to play for the story and happen to be somewhat bad at platformers, and in multiplayer, especially not if you like a game where you can be free from unreasonable death and respawn-grinding extremely difficult mobs.","June 13, 2015","false","32.0"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","3","10","0","0"

Enjoyed the game right up until my first challenge in the game. From what I gathered, you need to complete these special challenges to get special coins to spend at special vendors. Nice idea I thought and I was keen to find my first challenge and earn some coin. After spending many many hours over the past week on the first challenge in this game, the boulder challenge, I decided to delete the game from my steam folder today. Why, because I simply didn't enjoy spending hours of my precious spare time waiting to be 'lucky' by this totally crappy implemented challenge. A rinse and repeat, load and reload, keep trying till you eat your controller challenge and only when you get lucky enough to fluke your way past this challenge 'might' you find some enjoyment out of the time you spend on it, thanks but no thanks. Perhaps if this was the final challenge or closer to the end of the game, I would have over looked or understood the nature of this challenge and either move on to something else or spend more time on it in order to complete it and the game itself. But as it was my first challenge and there is no way to learn, predict or progress through it without being complety blessed by luck, I felt that this was poorly implemented and far too early in the game to get such a 'silly' challenge. I watched several Utube vids on this challenge, incase I was being a noob, but nearly all comments agreed this challenge can only be done by being very lucky, the few who managed to finish the challenge said it took 500+ tries, @5-6 hours on 1 challenge and that in my mind, is not fun in any shape or form. I simply do not want to invest any more time into this game as I fear the other 'so called' challenges will be anything like this, I really do not want to know or find out.\n\nI have been playing games since the days of Pong, played the best and the worst, hardly ever bother writting a review, which is usually a positive review of a game that I really enjoyed, but this imo deserved a negative review from me. I may have been unlucky, this challenge might be the hardest challenge in the game, maybe the rest of the game is the best ever but with me, first impressions last. I feel like I wasted enough of my precious spare time over the past few weeks on this one game, with 75% of that time spend on just this one challenge alone. I didn't get much enjoyment nor satisfaction from this purchase. I enjoy most games with challenges if they are based on logic/progress/learning/clues/skill with gradual increase in difficulty and an incentive to complete it. Anyhow, my experience with this game has left me with a vile taste for both the game and its developers. I shall be very cautious with any future products from them and probably make a point to avoid games made by them as I fear it will contain similar game mechanics which I personally do not enjoy.\n\nMy 2cs.","July 9, 2015","false","45.5"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

For every good thing, there are a several annoyances meddling around making the game bad.\nLet me make this clear: NONE of the annoyances are optimization-related. My computer ran it fine with no lag - etc.\nAlso, when I bought the game, "Metroidvania" was one of the tags and that's what made me buy it. I'll be reviewing this game with a baised that it's suppoesd to be Metroidvania.\n\nObviously, it's not Castlevania. Again, it's not Metroid. It has basic Metroidvania qualities for backtracking and grinding. but that's about it. Hilariously, I feel that the game hurts itself by using that label. Here's something it does wrong: Your mobility is bad. Seriously people! What kind of Metroidvania character can't jump twice their own height and have almost no control about their trajectory? Fun fact: giving us a double jump doesn't mean you've cleared that hurdle. The earliest challenge I found was hilariously difficult to get to because it was just a simple jump with a zero-tolerance for error on when you pressed jump. Pro-tip: that's not a challenge, but a repetitive waste of time.\nSpeaking of repetitive waste of time, that brings me to the challenge itself: Never centralize challenges on luck. Doesn't matter if it's just one little challenge. It's a challenge and anyone, even players who don't go for 100% completion, would want to try to complete it. Failing a luck based challenge does NOT mean that the challenge is difficult or challenging, but it'll have the demoralizing effect of a real challenge anyway. In Metroidvania games, "Skill" defines a challenge and luck is NOT "Skill."\n\nI get that we're supposed to be playing some stereo-typical "nerd" with questionable stamina and physical abilities. Let me ask you this: what's the sense of being in a "magical" world to the point that you drink potions, heal via a creature that lives in some pocket dimension, use magical equipment and magic spells, but never improve your own body beyond having better equipment and items? Yes, I know there are potions that increase your walking speed, but that's not solving the issue. That's literally like drinking alcohol; temporary solution. Also, potions lasting 30 seconds, 60 seconds... even if it was 5 minutes (hyperbole), that's limiting. I guess it prevents game-breaking if you choose to go into potions and all, but I get the feeling that you're about to start charging me micro-payments so I can have fun with the game. To me, the feeling of micro-payments in a Metroidvania game is a sign that the Gaming Industry is entering a Depression. I.E.: It has hit the bottom.\n\nYou know in good Metriodvania games, the defining feature is that if you're about to beat the game, but feel like trolling the enemies from 10 dungeons ago for giving you a hard time? Here's a common way: go in there and just wreck them! Here's a better way: de-equip everything and wreck them ANYWAY. That's a cathartic element in Metriodvania games and you can't do this in this game. The entire point is riding on the main character being... well, himself. With that, the concept of Metroidvania falls flat on the WORST possible facts of the genre. Backtracking is NOT fun. In games like Metroid and Castlevania, it's made that backtracking IS fun because discovering and reaching that point you couldn't before while killing the enemies by the equivalent of looking at them really hard gives a sense of acheivement. The line "I'm better than I was before" is another defining feature and this game somehow lacks it. How? Cheap enemies.\nNow, I'm not going to complain about this game being cheap with certain enemies because:\na) I didn't have enough of a problem with it.\nb) I believe it'll be covered by others.\nSame thing with the multiplayer: I don't care for it, so I'm not reviewing it here.\n\n(Note: if you see the "time" reading only ~4 hours, something happened with my steam, so I lost a lot of data in a whole bunch of games (thank goodness my TF2 items are okay!!!). This one got hit along with the achievements (somehow...), so I'm reviewing it before I uninstall.)\n\n\nStake-into-heart Attack:\nI kiiiiinda regret buying it. That's a first for a game I got during the Steam Summer Sale. I'm thoroughly disappointed because a few different decisions during development and I'd actually love the game. Main decision that set it on the path to receive my hate: It's a test of patience rather than skill. If you want me to use a non-Metroidvania example, then here: Dark Souls is a test of skill. I beat Dark Souls in a week. (It wasn't NG+ or a second character or something, but my first character with no prior experience in the game series.)","September 11, 2014","false","4.3"," 15 of 36 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","15","36","0","0"

A great metroidvania with 3 littles flaws :\n1) Combat system is horrible. Can't dodge, can't kite (beside 2 very slow creatures in the game). You either kill from afar before they reach you or you slugfest them to death while chugging healing pots and rejuv spell. Jump are awfull, weapons animations are clunky, spells must be done standing and are interupted by anything. Pets (free moving and firing companions) are often the best source of dps/CC you will have.\n2) Skill system is so 1980 it's wearing a mulet. You get 5 skill points per level. There is 5 melee weapons skill, 3 ranged weapons, 1 constitution, 2 armor, 1 potion skill and 8 magic school. You NEED to max 1 melee,  the constitution, 1 armor and one ranged or magic. So you have 1 points to spare per level. You'll never experienced most of the magic (especially since you must wait till the end of the game for the last ones to be introduced). Same with the weapons, if you favored Sword, you won't be able to equip this great hammer you found. And the skeletons will laugh at your pitifull damage to them. Incidentally, if you didn't take holy magic or bludgeoning weapons, skelletons will be a pain to handle.\nIs it logical ? Yes. Is it loyal to the D&D tabletop secondary edition alinea 4 appendix 25c ? Yes. Is it enjoyable ? No. And if you invest some points into every thing, you are bad at every thing. So basicaly, choose a few (five or six) spend all your points there and say goodby to other unless you decide to reroll. But the gameplay is poor and only driven by the story so the replayability is low.\n3) It's really hipster tabletop RPG vs video game RPG. It's mocking video game for it's inconsistency and logical flaw (you can't arm an organless skelleton with arrows, you fool) and it's fun. But it's missing the point of videogame as Gameplay > Logic. So this game is hardcore. Not difficult, but strict and rigid. It's a fashion statement.\n\nAll this are the minor flaws of the single campain. But it's great, it's fun. It's enjoayble (even this horrible stupid last level from hell).  Great scenario, great plot twist. I spent hours on this.\n\nThe big pill of horse manure is the multiplayer part. Basically, you remove everything that was great in solo (story, pets, non linear exploration and backtracking), you keep all that was not fun (combat system, skill attribution), emphasise them and create new hurdles.\n-you now chain small linear dungeons with no link between them execpt that you find the key for the next one on the boss.\n-you must grind bosses 3, 6 or 9 times to buy spells for magic school were you allready spent points but couldn't find books.\n-you die constantly and must walk from last check point to you struggling friend for 2 minutes.\n-Lot's of brutforcing certain pack of enemies, slughfest, die, revive, run, slugfest, die etc.\n-you weapons and armor decays on death loosing 5% efficiency every time.\n-you can't repair in dungeon and must quit and restart dungeon from scratch.\n-repairs are expensive.\n-spell regents are expensive.\n-to get money, you will have to grind previous dungeon.\n\nSo, you reach the cimetery, full of undead. None of you specialized in holy magic ? You are doomed. You can't just grind a bit and spend 3 points in holy. You must have some pro cleric or you wont pass. You will slugfest skelettons, die a bit, be less effective, die a bit more, be even less effective, die a lot etc. Then your armor/weapons are completly useless and broken. Go repair.\nIt's the same when learning boss patern. You die a lot, you mage progress in learning how to deal with it but you do less damage each time and die faster each time.\nThere is no "fight smarter" in this game. You can bring the correct weapon/magic school to the fight (by rerolling mostly) but the combat system is so clunky that you can barelly dodge missile and not dodge melee at all. Slugfest and bruteforce all the way.\n\nI spent lots of time playing this game solo and overcame the mechanics because the story and exploration was good. We spend some time playing it in multi but at some point we saw that it's was all badly constructed and grindy.\nToo bad.","December 29, 2013","false","48.7"," 43 of 95 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","43","95","0","0"

It starts off as a fun little Metroidvania RPG, but after a while, it starts getting needlessly frustrating.  A boss that, through trial-and-error, forces you to drop nearly every item in your inventory just to even have a chance to beat it (when inventory management is already a chore).  Common enemies that ruin your weapons, forcing needlessly long grinds to restore them.

Intersting story.\n2.  It's nice if you play it for the multiplayer.\n\nCons (mainly when playing this game solo):\n1. The customization may seem great at first, but at one point you'd realize weapon balancing is funky in different areas/boss battles, and by that point either you'd want to roll a new character or have to respec.\n\n2. Pets are hard to manage for no good reason, and there's no way to level them up. In Castlevania, pets are either invincible or they cannot be targeted by mobs... not in Unepic. Your pet will die in later stages, and they cannot be unsummoned/summoned on the fly because then they lose their energy charge.\n\n3. The game suffers a fundamental problem in character actions - too many actions for a simple game. For example, instead of setting an AI behavior for heal potions (i.e. heal with lowest/highest quality), the game requires you to map one button to one function only. That may seems fine in the beginning... at one point you'd have so many items and weapons and spells that you can use it starts to look stupid. Castlevania's Symphony of the Night and later series features tons of characters action... all being performed on a game pad. Do we really need 20+ hot keys for a 2D action game?\n\n4. So areas gets harder after you "open up the gates." It's meant to be part of the story progression, right? But some areas would get a lot more harder because all the mobs can aggro you once the gates are lifted... and they stay that way.\n\n5. Some boss moves you cannot dodge with skill, it's almost luck based, i.e. raining down magic randomly.","May 14, 2014","false","10.8"," 7 of 28 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","7","28","0","1"

The game is not unfair, but it does not like you. Adapt, or suffer. It's one of the few I've ever seen with a single player campaign anti-cheat. You are expected to play the game its way. It's not... bad, and technically, you could grind xp to overcome some poor skill point expenditures... but.\n\nThe humor is... technically present. A lot of jokes are references and callbacks to things that were funny in their original setting... but don't make sense here, and are not even jokes. One entire sidequest is lifted from the plot of The Golden Child. Great movie, but word-for-word re-enactment of Eddie Murphy from the 80s is not proof of writing chops. It's plagiarism.\n\nAfter finding myself wondering if I was doing a few bits right, I looked up what more was to come in the game. And I'm disappointed. After the ending, the game shows one character ordering skeletal minions to ♥♥♥♥ and kill a player daring to complain about the crappy ending. The skeletons point out that's biologically impossible, and instead get to murdering. So... the authors know the endings are bad... and threaten the player for daring to speak out.\n\nI have a problem with that. I have so many problems with that.

Now, it's not one that I'm going to spend hundreds upon hundreds of hours on, but that's not what it's meant to be. However, there is still a possibility of that if you get involved in the multiplayer scene and start making maps. Personally my experience is limited to playing the single player campaign and soloing the first multiplayer Dungeon because I couldn't find anyone to play with.\n\nThe story itself is actually rather surprising later on, and you get hints throughout the whole game that perhaps everything is not what it seems. That said, there are a lot of silly, immature, and even downright stupid things said by the protagonist. Of course, he himself (and the entirety of this game) is a parody of the a-typical gamer (and RPG). If you are looking for something that is both entertaining, in-depth, and doesn't take itself too seriously, then this is definitely a game you should check out.","December 8, 2014","true","63.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I bought it, put it on, thought the intro was kinda funny, and thought the game would be a bit better than I thought.\n\nThen It started, and I thought it looked ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. It honestly doesn't have the best start in my opinion, aside from the banter, which is rather humurous, while also adding to the story and stuff, which is a great part of the game.\n\nFortunately, I didn't just toss it aside with my first thoughts. I kept playing, got a little further, and the game kept getting better. It's an interesting combination of sidescrolling, RPG, and action. 2D skyrim with some features removed if you will. It's got weapons, skills, spells, potions, and all sorts of other parts to the game that make this game great.\n\nIt should be noted that I'm not rather big at posting reviews, and that this game actually made me think it was worth it to write one.\n\nIf it's not on sale, it's worth buying, if it is on sale, It's a no brainer.","December 24, 2014","true","8.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

UnEpic was on sale and I took a chance. Looking at the file size it's a quick download on any bandwith. But what it does compaired to the memory it takes is Epic. It's simple fun made with witty humor with a broad range of more weapons and items than you can shake a stick at. What's fun is it takes an average Joe (us) and puts you in a world of monsters which surprisingly takes you as one of them at face value even though you are clearly human. Hense you take up arms overthrowing them in their ignorance. The game balances perfectly with the simple controls and challenges as you hoard up your armory. Only one minor gripe. The controls, I would perfer to use my digtal pad to control my character and not the analog. This is a 2D dungeon crawler and a digtal control makes for better control. But like I said, a minor gripe. How you tackle them game, well the game lets you chose. This game can be as easy or hard as you like it to be. If it's too tuff just grind up your level on weaker creatures until you can overpower bosses or you can figure out the bosses weakness and defeat them the harder way. This is a game that will definitely suck up my time when I get so time to lose later but given the creativity in this surprising small gem, don't be surprised if you too get hooked.

Now, it's not one that I'm going to spend hundreds upon hundreds of hours on, but that's not what it's meant to be. However, there is still a possibility of that if you get involved in the multiplayer scene and start making maps. Personally my experience is limited to playing the single player campaign and soloing the first multiplayer Dungeon because I couldn't find anyone to play with.\n\nThe story itself is actually rather surprising later on, and you get hints throughout the whole game that perhaps everything is not what it seems. That said, there are a lot of silly, immature, and even downright stupid things said by the protagonist. Of course, he himself (and the entirety of this game) is a parody of the a-typical gamer (and RPG). If you are looking for something that is both entertaining, in-depth, and doesn't take itself too seriously, then this is definitely a game you should check out.","December 8, 2014","true","63.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has a decent level of feeling both grindy and not grindy at times; I had trouble approaching some of the mobs in the game when they were just large groups (especially when they learned how to use ladders), but I felt that the bosses were fair. Bosses in the game were not necessarily long affairs, but slipping up during one of them could prove very punishing. If they were long (>5 minutes), it would be tedious, but I like the balance achieved.\n\nThere are a few flaws (in my opinion) in this game that I don't think will get 'fixed' for the final product, and in a sense, game balance is one of them. There isn't quite as much freedom as I'd want out of a game like this; the character page looks as if you can follow archetypes such as a mage, but it really won't work for the game as a whole. My character used a balance of range, melee, and magic, and I don't know how I'd fare if I didn't use all three of those. Fortunately, you have enough skill points to have strengths in all those areas. It just means that you, as a player, are quite capable of making a character that might just not be able to stand up to specific challenges.\n\nMultiplayer seems like a great idea, and I think the tools used in it show a lot of potential. Better yet, it appears as though the multiplayer is getting the bulk of the attention. Unfortunately, only a really small crowd plays multiplayer; try and get a couple friends to play with you if possible, and it would definitely enhance, if not create, the experience. As of writing this, I haven't quite done that yet. That being said, when I have played with others through finding/making games, I have found the other people to be easy to work with. That might not be the experience across the board, but I imagine that a game like this has less trolls on the multiplayer compared to more popular titles.\n\nAs for the early access part...I wouldn't have noticed that it was in this stage if it wasn't plastered over the steam page. The single player has always been completely done, and the multiplayer, again, only suffers from lack of players. I could see fear in playing a game nowhere near completion, but the early access was a solid product.\n\nAll in all, I've played this game for a good amount of time for its price, and I think it makes to be a fun game. It's unforgiving at times, but when it really matters, you can know that you were accountable for messing up most of the time. This game deserves to have a larger crowd, because it's pretty solid; even in its early access. There is a lot of fun to be had.","June 22, 2014","true","67.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Both the graphics and sound do what are needed to be done, yet neither are distasteful nor lacking.

If you didn't like the game, these surprises might just persuade you.\n\nThe level build-up is fair and you can reset your points if you wish to change to another type of class, so you don't have to start over with a new char. Though starting over would also be fun.\nYou will eventually reset your chars stats. The different environments will put you to the test and you will find yourself naked at some points.\n\nI'm very satisfied and hope more will buy this game. I'm at the end of the Story mode and I am playing multiplayer. I hope to find more online players to share the obstacles and other fun through this game.\n\nI have though one request, I know it is much to ask for and I know it is lots of work behind.\nMany wants a female character. I'm happy either if she is a DLC or within the Story.\n\nA Massive Punch of THank You to those Behind Unepic :3","June 10, 2014","true","121.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The 2D style is usually not my thing, but it just doesn't matter in this game, 'cause it's just so awesome. I was sold in 2 minutes playing it. The story is funny, the dialogues are hilarious and the ironic nerd-mocking humor makes me crack up every  time. The gameplay is great and satisfactory, there's a loooaad of weapons, spells, items, pets that fight for you, you name it. I haven't finished the game yet, but I already spent quite a few hours on it, so the game duration is really long for a game this price. Sure, it's early access, but that doesn't show, tbh I didn't even know that, untill I read it while writing this review :D The base price is just not too much. It looks indie and simple, but trust me, the game is much more than that. OH yeah and there's also multiplayer!\n\nPro's:\n- hilarious\n- combat\n- items, weapons, etc...\n- RPG & skill system is easy to get into\n- hours and hours of fun\n- feels like a finished product\n- great variety in enemies, dungeons, characters,...\n- map & notes system\n- impregnate orcs....uhm\n\nCons\n\n- sometimes too time consuming to complete a sidequest\n- you're screwed if you don't take notes on the map\n- multiplayer sometimes laggy and underpopulated\n\n8.5/10 A must play!","June 22, 2014","true","14.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It brings back an air of nostalgia playing a PnP game of D&D with my friends and dealing with an unruly DM. Only by telling the game story like this could they make switches that do nothing but kill you in front of a a group of chortling goblins make sense. It channels in the best parts of a Castlevania/Metroid style game and still is able to be fresh and challenging. Kind of almost reminds me of Terreria in a way too without the sandbox gameplay.\n\nPlaying with a friend almost requires voice chat, but is well worth it. There is one level in co-op where you are blinded and have to lead your teammate through an obstacle course with a series of voice commands.

Truly, this is a gem among treasures, a game that's hard to put down, inherent with solid gameplay, and unexpected but welcome intelligent and witty humor - a combo difficult to pull off, yet done well, effortlessly presented in such a way that I found myself  buying into the character as though he had life.  The approach is original, and the design is unique; a perfectly crafted masterpiece, complimented with inuitive, and responsive controls, all wrapped up in an 2-d (old school) side scrolling adventure.  It delivers a visual style fitting of itself, almost as though it created the style as well, rounding out the package and value even more.  It's simple, yet elegantly crafted, with small details and nuances, it can make an old school gamer smile, that old.... warm smile, a bit of 'thats cool,' from the days when we used words like "rad;" for whatever reason this game nailed something nostalgic, and tapped that old school love, in these modern times.  There is a reason this game is considered one of the top 10 indie games... ever.  If there is a game worth your time, this is likely it.  Simply put, this game is 15 dollars of happiness. .   .    buy it.

The UI is the first of its kind in the genre, boasting interesting and really PC-spesific features (hotkeys, customizable windows, etc.). The weapons also adds extra layers of meta game, because the various weapon types don't just vary in speed, damage and other common stats. You will have to build your character wisely, because putting all your points in a singular weapon type is sure to fail as soon as you go up against an enemy with strong defenses against it. You also have pets and spells and armour and potions and scrolls, and all that good stuff.\nThe RPG levelling system is deep and allows for much experimentation.

It involves lighting all of the torches in The Garden. Right after you light it and the skulls pop up it crashes before they start laughing. so if your playing on a difficulty other than easy be careful so you dont lose a bunch of progress!","October 20, 2014","true","11.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is fun, innovative in a variety of aspects, and very fun. There is a lot of gameplay in this game and you will not be disappointed in it's length. I was expected randomly generated dungeons, but it is all prebuilt, which actually adds to the experience because it is well designed. I have a few gripes about the game, but they are fairly minor. The character system is difficult to navigate mainly because you aren't given most of your options at the beginning of the game. In fact, some of them you get until near the end. I got a bit frustrated because I didn't make the wisest choices with my character points. But toward the middle of the game, there is a quest to "fix your character."\n\nOverall, I'd say this is one of the best games if played in quite a while, and you like RPG games with so decent boss fights and lots of options in terms of weapons, spells, and potions. Then I'm sure you will enjoy this game, especially for the price.","November 7, 2014","true","39.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

UnEpic was on sale and I took a chance. Looking at the file size it's a quick download on any bandwith. But what it does compaired to the memory it takes is Epic. It's simple fun made with witty humor with a broad range of more weapons and items than you can shake a stick at. What's fun is it takes an average Joe (us) and puts you in a world of monsters which surprisingly takes you as one of them at face value even though you are clearly human. Hense you take up arms overthrowing them in their ignorance. The game balances perfectly with the simple controls and challenges as you hoard up your armory. Only one minor gripe. The controls, I would perfer to use my digtal pad to control my character and not the analog. This is a 2D dungeon crawler and a digtal control makes for better control. But like I said, a minor gripe. How you tackle them game, well the game lets you chose. This game can be as easy or hard as you like it to be. If it's too tuff just grind up your level on weaker creatures until you can overpower bosses or you can figure out the bosses weakness and defeat them the harder way. This is a game that will definitely suck up my time when I get so time to lose later but given the creativity in this surprising small gem, don't be surprised if you too get hooked. Definitely a game done right and smart. Go get Epic with your Unepic self...","November 17, 2014","true","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Great humor, plenty of quests, lot's of items, and at the time of writing this, multiplayer is currently in alpha with people currently playing it. To make things clear, the main game is already finished. The "Early Access" part is only for multiplayer, which is still in the works. That's not to say the main game won't be getting anything new, but the multiplayer is the sole reason UnEpic is "Early Access"\n\nExploring the Castle is great fun. Each zone is unique, with it's own unique look, feel, and the enemies that inhabit it.\n\nMagic is fun too. A large variety of spells to choose from. My only gripe with the magic system is that if I want to specialize in a certain school of magic, I have to go through the main story in order to get to the point where you initially get that magic. I'm not sure how it works Online, since I haven't played that yet(wanted to finish story).\n\nEach zone has multiple side quests you can discover and complete. Each one has it's own little story.\n\nThere's also multiple pets you can find that will aid you someway in battle.\n\nOverall, it's an amazing RPG, definitely worth getting at any price. Along with Online Multiplayer, and the ability to create and share your maps with friends, gives this game a lot of replayability.\n\nEDIT(12/25/13): It has been 6 months since I initially wrote this review, and much has changed. While there was partial controller support when I first wrote this, there is now full support, making the game very comfortable to play with the controller, and the keyboard controls are also great.\n\nThere's is now also voice acting for the vast majority of the game. Some generic environment dialogue has yet to be Voiced, but all Story Dialogue, both Main and Side, are all voiced, along with the tips/tutorial.","June 16, 2013","true","42.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A very active dev team that is always responsive and adding new things and seasonal events make UnEpic one of the truly hidden gems from indie devs as of late.

UnEpic was on sale and I took a chance. Looking at the file size it's a quick download on any bandwith. But what it does compaired to the memory it takes is Epic. It's simple fun made with witty humor with a broad range of more weapons and items than you can shake a stick at. What's fun is it takes an average Joe (us) and puts you in a world of monsters which surprisingly takes you as one of them at face value even though you are clearly human. Hense you take up arms overthrowing them in their ignorance. The game balances perfectly with the simple controls and challenges as you hoard up your armory. Only one minor gripe. The controls, I would perfer to use my digtal pad to control my character and not the analog. This is a 2D dungeon crawler and a digtal control makes for better control. But like I said, a minor gripe. How you tackle them game, well the game lets you chose. This game can be as easy or hard as you like it to be. If it's too tuff just grind up your level on weaker creatures until you can overpower bosses or you can figure out the bosses weakness and defeat them the harder way. This is a game that will definitely suck up my time when I get so time to lose later but given the creativity in this surprising small gem, don't be surprised if you too get hooked. Definitely a game done right and smart. Go get Epic with your Unepic self...","November 17, 2014","true","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

OK - top twenty. It feels little bit retroish, but it's a modern game - a nice graphics, variable environments but most importantly - very balanced gameplay. I read several negative reviews on the steam and I was little bit afraid, because almost all of them started with "this is awesome game, but only until you reach the laboratory", or the tower, or other later parts of the game. They said that the monsters become unbalanced tough and if you spend skill points into wrong skills the game become unbeatable. I didn't have this experience. I went slowly through the game, making all the quest, taking everything (and it did NOT feel like grind - it was pure fun for completionist like myself (-: ) and I really appreciate that the game become little bit harder towards the end.\n\nIt wasn't impossible at all. For example - you will discover armored knights and with your current skill, they will kill you with 3-4 blows and you wil kill them with 5 blows. When you stand directly in front of it - yes - it's impossible to win. But when you climb the ledder blow him once, return, wait little bit and repeat this - it's no problem. Does it sound boring? I have to kill 10 or 15 knights like this. Than I get better mace and the knights wasn't problem any more... When standard knights was ok, knights with poison spear become challenging. But I found out, that by jumping you can avoid all of their attacks. And so one - there is always some "technique".\n\nOh - and I have to mention, that there is an orb that will reset all your skills - so there is no problem with unwisely spended skill points.\n\n\nSooo... Nice graphics, perfect control (don't be discouraged by screenshots - all the menus around the screen is really clever), interesting environments, unique bosses, balanced dificulty curve, rewarding gameplay (when you return to the earlier stages and kill almost anything with 1 blow, you can feel the progress of your character) etc. This is really good game and I would say, that's even better than la-mulana (and for me - that meens a lot (-: )\n\n\nSome hints, if you cannot decide where to spend skill points at the begining:\n\n- I invested in sword, mace, armor skills always to max limit - this melee approach works rather good\n- I invested only 6 points to fire (for good use of fireball) and not to any other magic skills - I used the fireball to reach distant creatures or in a boss fight (you will kill big tree with fireball really easily)\n- 10 points in potions, but I make only 5 of them (-:\n\n- excalibur is the best sword in game\n- hammer of the paladin is the best mace\n- this 2 weapon is all you need (-:\n\n- there is paralyzing pet in special retro level - it's the best pet I think. But you will get it very late - until then frog was my favourite because it kills all the annoyng flying thinks that is hard to hit with melee.\n\n- very good potion is potion of regen. You are almost invincible with it. If you have 2-3 large potions of regen, big brainy boss is really eeeeasy\n- last level was little bit chalanging, but I read somewhere about bow of corrosion. I didn't use a bow in a whole game, but I reset my skills (with orb) and max bow skill, use this bow and the level was funnily easy.\n\n- you can find save files in userdata subdir of steam. There you can create copy of your save file if you like to try something before final decision. I used this 2-3 times...","August 13, 2015","true","24.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The voice acting is top notch and the plot (while not exactly unique) was sufficiently interesting enough to keep my attention.\n\nHowever, the dialogue itself is extremely cringeworthy. The writers may have tried to come off as endearing and clever, but the overuse of 'nerd culture' in the dialogue was enough to make me switch off the voicing halfway into my playthrough. The graphics aren't anything to phone home about, and they can start to grate on the eyes after a while.

Every piece of dialogue in this game is either inherently lame, or is the lamest possible circlejerk reference to anything associated with nerds.\nBeing part of a terribly voiced clip of dialogue is a much more hamfisted, lazy way to do this than including meaningful visual references. Even so, the references are way too overdone, and assumes that the target audience is coming to a game of this style to hear about every piece of geek fiction under the sun. I personally do not come for a game in the vein of Super Metroid or Castlevania post-Symphony of the Night to hear anything about Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, Dungeons and Dragons or Dragon Warrior. I’ve enjoyed those properties through a means that is palatable to me in the past, and this is the furthest thing I have experienced from that.\nAnimation is sloppy/amateurish. No character customization. Main character looks like a tool. The would-be novel “modern character goes back to a medieval fantasy setting” is squandered by this game’s dumbfounded approach.\nIf you enjoy the Big Bang Theory and are somehow still have the basic intelligence required to play through a videogame, this is probably for you. If you’re looking for a fresh take on the Metroid format, do yourself a favour and look elsewhere. If there were an option to take out every piece of dialogue in the game I would probably have recommended it as a mediocre example of that; but this plot, with the lowest level of self-awareness it could possibly have, brings the rest of the game so far down with it that you would be better off staying away.\nCorrection: setting the language to UnEnglish fixes a lot of my problems with the referential humor. Then you can pretend it's a poorly translated game that has no excuse because it was released a couple years ago! Still too lame to recommend.","July 5, 2015","false","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
