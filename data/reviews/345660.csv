It however falls very short of that goal. Graphics are last generation quality that somehow taxes modern video cards. The only positive things I could say about the game is it's selection of bikes and gear. But it falls short from there. It feels very shallow and geared towards the casual gamer/racing fan.\n\nShort-comings in on track riding is what ruins the game the most. It is the same arcade style simulation (an oxymoron) engine as the previous MotoGP games. Trailbraking deep is ridiculous and offers no feedback when the front wheel is at it's limit. The reactions of the bike to too much throttle is the same for every bike. Turning into the first corner is always the same even if the race just started and the front tire is still "cold". Then there are the small missing details. No clutch lever use even on the older bikes. The throttle hand works but the brake lever is never used, never mind the rear brake pedal on the right foot. There are ZERO braking markers for non-track circuits. Only occasionally is there a reference point like a tree or a fence, but the rider is left with nothing to judge the approach most of the time.\n\nThen there's the ridiculously aggressive AI that has no qualms of ramming passed you because somehow collisions only penalize one bike. The AI will insist on it's line even if you're in front of it and worst of all will not brake if you plan on braking earlier than it. The AI is also on a very suboptimal line\n\nThe set up of the game progression is obviously an afterthought to Milestone as there is NO QUALIFYING SESSION. YOU ARE ALWAYS 8TH. Leaving you with having to deal with the 7 AI-controlled bikes that will slow you down. Then there's the classification of the bikes into races. Some are beyond lazy such as grouping the MT07 with Ducati Monsters and Triumph Street triples because they are all below 700cc. WHAT?! That's a very ignorant way to classify a class race. The MT07 MAY have a corner speed advantage, but that advantage is completely blown away on circuits with straights. Why even bother having that bike? There was no beta testing for this game.\n\nThen there's the customization for looks and performance. The biggest mistake Milestone has in this area is completely ignoring the significance of a rear shock. The whole customization is an insult to any enthusiasts who love to customize their motorcycle's performance capability. Front forks are all stock upgrades. No chance of changing oil, springs, or even valves. Seat height, wheelbase, sprocket size, rotor size, handlebar vs clipons, removal of DOT required parts like lights.\n\nMilestone also only includes a very small amount of tracks despite having the license rights to the tracks in MotoGP15. None of those tracks appear in this game. Some tracks are ridiculously unfit for racing. Miami circuit being the most obvious because the street is too damn narrow .\n\nAll in all RIDE is a game made by a casual company  meant for the casual gamer. If you want a game that shows the dedication to the sport like Tourist Trophy did for the Playstation 2, you will be very disappointed.","May 17, 2015","false","17.1"," 55 of 69 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","55","69","2","0"

There's been many MotoGP and WSBK games, but not many that use real-world motorcycles. I do enjoy riding some of the lesser known, or less racing-orientated bikes, its unusual.\n\nThe gameplay is good, not amazing, but good. Sometimes the rider can be a little sluggish, almost like a deliberate input lag of sorts. Its most noticeable when switching directions quickly in a chicane, the rider will be noticeably delayed in swapping his body position on the bike. Sometimes the 'simulation' style of gameplay where excessively hard braking or hard acceleration causes the bike to squirm or slide aren't particularly smooth or realistic. There isn't that many tracks in the game, the selection will get repetitive after a while.\n\nThe graphics are ok, the bikes and tracks look fair enough but the riders standing helmetless next to the bikes in the menus look ridiculous. 10years have passed since video game characters looked this simplistic.\n\nThe audio, where do I start? Its terrible. Truly aweful. The bikes noises are appalling, I turned them off long ago, like some weird electronically generated whine. The best motorcycle engine noises in a video game ever, are in Burnout Paradise. And bikes are a side show in that game! Come on! Get your act together.\n\nSummary:\n\nPros:\n\n- Great Selection of bikes, even some older 80's and 90's calssics.\n- Fast access to decent bikes, no need to spend hours riding slow bikes (unless you want to).\n- Decent on-bike graphics.\n- Decent controls.\n- Bike customization is limited, but still relatively well implemented. A tuned bike is still noticeably faster than the standard version.\n\nCons:\n\n- The sound is abysmal. Bikes sound dreadful.\n- Some glaring omissions as far as bikes are concerned.\n- Helmetless riders look ridiculous, very dated.\n- Controls can sometimes feel delayed.\n- Some occassional dodgey slides where the physics don't add up.\n- Bike customization could have been better. Custom paint jobs, maybe even workshop support for cutom graphics kits etc. Why can I remove all the mirrors and indicators on some, but some leave the indicators when you choose this option? Where are the race fairings with no lights?\n- Limited number of tracks.\n\nUltimately if you like bike racing games, this one is great, I may have been critical, but it can be very fun and its nice racing around on something that isn't necessarily a fully fledged race bike.","February 25","true","7.9"," 18 of 25 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","18","25","0","0"

Riding in the cockpit view reveals some horrible mirror reflections (if you can even call it that) and some messed up reflections on most wind screens. I really thought they would fix this before the official release but no, it's still there and it looks really bad. The graphics can look pretty good at times and pretty bad other times, often being somewhere in between. I feel MotoGP 14 is having a bit more consistency in the graphics department although it has some problems as well.\n\nThe engine sounds are mostly uninspiring and often really dull sounding in my opinion (I play in cockpit view), although the engine sound gets a bit better on some of the supersport bikes. This problem, again, is shared at times in MotoGP 14. Sounds other than the engines are lacking as well (the wind starts to blow at 200 km/h). I can't comment on the music because I always turn it down in racing games.\n\nThe handling of the bikes in Ride is stiffer and a bit more forgiving than in MotoGP 14 and this, for me, takes away from the fun. I think MotoGP 14 manages to pull off a lot better handling, although it might take a bit longer to get used to than in Ride.\n\nThe implementation of upgrading your bike is very lacking in my opinion. I like that sort of thing in games like Forza or Gran Turismo but in here it just feels like a tacked on feature with a lot of unused potential. I actually prefer the "level up" system in MotoGP 14 even though that has some unused potential as well. Maybe a combination of the two could be pretty sweet. It's pretty cool to be able to customize the look of the bikes but again, it is lacking there as well as there are mostly minor changes that you can adjust.\n\nThe carrer and the way you progress through the game is obviously taken from games like Forza and Gran Turismo but it never really captivated me here, while I often have a difficult time trying to put down the controller playing MotoGP 14.\n\nI keep trying to like this game but it just isn't that good, in my opinion. It can function as an alright break from the more solid MotoGP 14 with Ride's different types of bikes and tracks but most of the time I just can't get enough enjoyment out of this game to keep playing it for a lengthy period of time, even though it does have its moments.\n\nIt is really hard to decide if I sould recommend this game or not. I'd say only get it on a sale if it's really cheap unless you're a big fan of bike games.\n\n+ A pretty nice collection of bikes and tracks you won't find in most other bike sims.\n+ Sometimes the graphics shine for those screenshots of you favourite bikes.\n+ Some events are actually pretty fun.\n\n- Bike handling feels pretty stiff in my opinion.\n- Graphics errors are way too prominent and hard to look past (if you're riding in cockpit view).\n- The sound is really lacking overall, with some exeptions.\n- Upgrade system feels rushed.\n- Prone to crash","June 22, 2015","false","23.5"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","14","18","0","0"

I have WRC4 and MXGP and thorougly enjoy them. Put 12 hours into Ride now and am very much enjoying it. Like all race games I feel there are things that can make it better but thats just me. The gameplay is fun and challenging (put it on hard/realistc on pro handling with tcs and anti wheelie off and tell me its easy!) a good selection of bikes but not enough in my opinion. The graphics on the bikes are gorgeous and being able to customise the bike is a really nice feature. I am however a little annoyed at the moment as there is a bug going round (see forums) that wipes your data randomly after an autosave. I got to rank 9 in my 12 hours and all of a sudden "data corrupt" I hope this will be fixed as I am now going to take a break from this game as I'm slightly bemused!\n\nEven though the game has shafted me, I still can't leave it a negative.\n\nMy only 3 problems with the game,\n\n1: Lack of bikes.\n\nFor example, Naked class but no Bandits or Hornets? Arguably the most famous nakeds. No 400cc Class would love some of the 400 screamers. Only one 2T? Thats unfair finally a game with 2T's again and its just 1? Why no RGV, NSR etc? Not enough Twins, Not even the awesome SV650S/1000\n\n2: Sound:\n\nHas the Milestone sound crew every heard a Ducati L-Twin or even a big V-Twin like the VTR or TLR? Judging by the sound they make in this game I'm going to say no. I think its fantastic to see some twins in a game like the mighty TLR but it sounds awful, aslo if a Ducati with Termongonis sounded that weak in real life wouldent that be awful. The only bikes that sound "right" are the inline 4's. If fairness to Milestone most game companies get the sound wrong.\n\n3: Data Loss\n\nIt wiped my bloody game at rank 9 with 12 hours gameplay ffs\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=416117801\n\nAddtion 6/5/15\n\nNow the save bug is fixed its all good. The Achievments seem lacking. They dont even want you to complete the whole game. You can get level 1 before hitting the second series. I 100% this game in 24 hours, thats not too good:S","March 29, 2015","true","24.3"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","72","13","18","0","0"

It does the job to render good riding sensation, the bikes selection is large, there could be more tracks but there's a pleasant mix of real & theme based (Japan, Wales, French riviera..) course.\n\nAs you probably know, there's no real competition for motorcycle racing game. Many reviews here refers to Tourist Trophy on PS2 (2006) and even Superbike 2001 (GP500 anyone?). Now if you're one of those that have not been convinced by MotoGP piloting model, i'd suggest you give this one a try.\n\nIndeed it's rather close to Tourist Trophy in terms of sensation, bikes feels a little bit lighter and the speed effect is more convincing in RIDE. With all assistance desactivated, careful attention is needed on acceleration and braking. If you've never ride a motorcycle, it does matter to brake with the rear brake first then front (and also brake straight and never use the front brake when turning) and RIDE renders all of that.\n\nNow the flaws. First it's not very beautiful, i mentioned speed effect and i'd add motorbike models are well done, the rest is outdated. Textures are blurry, background landscape is terrible, no wow effect here. Sounds are failed for 2 cylinders engine (come on guys you're developping from italy), and changing your exhaust doesn't help. Prepare your own tracklist as well. There's also the "AI" that goes from buggy to terrible, at first it's funny to see an AI going wheelie at some start, but the constant ramming is ruining the fun at times.\n\nRecommended to all poor thirsty racers in need of something to keep up. After almost 10 years since Tourist Trophy guys, let's just hope it's not the last of its kind.\n","May 7","true","13.3"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","0"

The graphics aren't the greatest but the most important things, the bikes, look good. The controls are good but I highly recommend a controller.

The rider gear selection is only limited to 3 companys but spans multiple colors and level of gear. Motorcycle customization is similar and needs a wider variety. The only complaint I have of now is I'm stuck in windowed mode and the micro stuttering but can look past it until a patch is released.

BUT, soon as you push on and practice and get better and start winning, this game is very rewarding and fun! Uh take special note though, until your skills have increased, pay attention to the lead bike during the race and what they're riding, then get the same bike and upgrade the heck out of it, and winning will become more manageable, don't just go for your favorite manufacturer (Yamaha, much love for you, but the MV Agusta destroys the FZ-07 in the straights, got to beat em' in the turns). Like, srsly the starter bike is the naked class, and if you get a twin, all the triples (Friggin MV Agusta) for the first tier races will SPANK you. There is still a decent reward even for 7th place wins while you get practice to get better, but SRSLY pay attention to what the leader is riding and the bike stats when you are buying. Rest of the races are fairly well balanced and there is a lot to Unlock, plenty of tracks, and plenty of race types. I am enjoying it! Also, get used to the Turning/Rider mechanics, even with a far inferior bike you can beat em' in the turns!","April 3","true","24.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

This is basically the only street bike racing game besides the motogp series which id rather not spend money on.  I love riding motorcycles so im naturally going to like this game.  The riding is a little hard to get used to but you will get it in a few hours of playing.\n\nSure there are some things that are dumb and ridiculous but most games now-a-days are basically all unfinished games for top dollar. It is a little dumb you can smash on your front brake while your full lean and still able to have full stable contact with the ground.  Full lean on grass or sand is possible for some reason.  The biggest thing wrong this game has is the sounds of the motorcycles.  Theyre all basically generic stock muffler sound even though you straight piped your bike, and all the bikes basically run off the same sound with very very minor differences.\n\nThey have Drag Racing in this game which is incredibly pointless. As long as your bike is fully upgraded you will win every time.\n\nBesides all that this game is fun as hell. I really don't understand why this game has so many down votes.  Sure there are flaws (what game is perfect?) but this game is completely playable and you hardly notice these flaws.\n\n8/10","February 23","true","13.2"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Riding down the nice scenic roads with a few friends was nice and this has that feel.\n\nThe bikes seem accurate. I finally got to ride a Ducati Monster! You can upgrade your bikes with some events or grinding, they also have the option of renting tons of supersport bikes for free if you want to test them out without earning credits which is good. Tons of custom upgrades too. The competition of course increases or rides the same type of bikes making it harder since you have a less margin of error with faster bikes. Wish it had a few more tracks though, esp roads since motogp has very similar the tracks and gameplay.\n\nPROS:\n+Just enough tracks and nice scenic roads to cruise (could use more).\n+Good balance sim/arcade for casual fun but ample realistic elements\n+Ample bikes (some grinding for credits required), upgrades and features (front/back braking for differ impacts) You can't brake or excellerate hard in a turn without wiping out. You can turn too hard while going too slow either which is fairly accurate.\n\nRide is very similar to Motogp15 which is also made by Milestone, so they seem to have a decent formula and by simply making a few changes, but that is mostly just race-tracks with limited scenerey so can all seem the same after awhile. Glad they made this with some nice roadways rather than all racetracks.\n\nCONS: I had some tech issues with Ride and motogp 14 on my last pc which was just below the specs, but thought I could lower the graphics quality however it froze my pc for some reason. So its not optimized the best since many AAA games played on it fine. So ensure you exceed the specs..\n\nThese are my first impressions, 8 of 10 since this genre has limited options and junk like the game motorcycle club all should steer far away from. If you like bikes go to the rallies in Daytona Beach, NYC, Rott in Austin, TX etc, nice time with ladies, bikes and fun.","April 13","true","7.4"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

The whole frame work is good, but the developers leave much to be desired. They do not give any feedback or interaction in the forums. You leave bug reports and they are just ignored. The game is too unfinished and buggy. The physics are more arcadey, which for a developer that does the GP game as well, is pretty shocking. I played one of their older GP games and it was very bad. On top of all the issues, they just ignore all that and bring out DLC that does not address the main game flaws, It seems like they just want to rip people off.\n\nI have been riding bikes in RL for many years and many types of bikes. From my play time in the game, I can tell you that every bike is based off of the same poor physics template, they all handle all exactly the same, just some steer a little faster or some a little slower. They need to do a lot of work on the physics side of things, because it is far from realistic. Seems like plain lazy developers, and how they got the GP license I will never know. These developers are giving the game industry a bad name, I can't believe these people have no morals or care for what they do. I know I am being harsh, but I am fed up, Very disappointed :-(\n\nI have told all my friends and family to stay away from this.

Well, truth be told, I've played none at all, but as a rather adventurous real-life rider who cut his teeth on the winding roads of Oregon's wine country and coastal mountain range, I can say that the physics and bike handling are spot-on.  Especially when traction control is off, taking a corner too wide and getting off-road while leaned over will often result in a low-side bail, just like real life.  Cornering correctly at the highest speed you can, only to lean in the other direction and take the next, has a lot of weight, as it should; and it's very satisfying to get it right.  This does impart a certain learning curve since, even though bikes can "turn on a dime," they can't literally turn on a dime; there are nuances to the timing of brakes, throttle, and cornering that are not the same with cars, and you notice it much more when using a controller.  There's a certain finesse to timing ahead for your corners, but though some may feel that this makes the game unplayable, I find the challenge refreshing, and the difficulty not at all unfair.\nThe graphics are decent and the framerate stays smooth on my four-year-old computer (three-year-old graphics card) using maximum settings and 1.5GB environment textures.  I'd like to see how this looks on a newer computer, but alas... money.\nThe sound is where I have to dock some points.  While there's not much you can do to accurately synthesize an engine's sound and make it react to user input without reams of code (that I know of...), the bikes sound good, considering.  It's during momentous occasions such as crashes where the sound design really stinks, because while there might be a clunk or two, there's no horrible crunch, no grinding of metal and fiberglass as your bike flips and slides down the road, no scraping of leather as your character does the same.  It really removes a lot of impact from a corner taken too fast or too late.\nLastly, beware the bugs.  I read that this was originally slated for Stateside release in June, but I have it, and it seems as though it should have been held back until then.  I enjoy it quite a bit, but it's very irritating that my Ducati Diavel's exhaust pipes, turn signals, license plate, intake grills, and mirror stalks are all invisible.  I've heard of other people experiencing similar issues with graphics, and this really shouldn't be in a finished product.\nAll in all, though, foibles aside, I am having a ton of fun with Ride.  I now live in southern Minnesota, where you can't push your bike's cornering ability without risking a year's income on a potential speeding ticket, so this comes close to taking care of my lean cravings.  Hopefully Milestone will have a patch soon to take care of the bugs, and maybe the sound problems.  In any case, though, buy this game if you want a proper bike simulator.  It rips.","April 22, 2015","true","10.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Great bike customization, as well as rider (shitloaaaddd of wear, ex. helmets, gloves).\n\n2) Graphics\nAs for graphics....\nWEELLL, at least its optimization is fine (almost), running on my860m 4gb on ultra (only motion blur off), on 4096x2160 at around 24fps (not much, but as for a game this type, its fine "this aint a fps, just a race game)\nAs for 1920x1080, fps is very stable, my gpu even clocks down and locks at 48fps (48hz monitor)\nAs for the worst part of graphics, even though i put it on ultra, with "high res textures" and with 4k res, lot of the textures dont even look like theyve tried FULLHD, even menus are pixelated (like loading screen), tectures like for ex. brake fluid cap are just MASSIVLEY pixelated\n\n3)Physics\nFor the physics, this thing is ok, but not great (hard to make a bike sim) in reality biking is a bit different, but u can get used to the game.

The game worked pretty fine, but from some time, it stopped working (loading a track takes for everrr)\n\nSo, pros and cons:\n+Fun factor\n+Not only track bikes\n+Customization of the bikes, and rider\n+ Smaller bikes (250cc)\n\nCons:\n-price (20 euro compared to 5 euro for Motogp 14, as in my place of living)\n- dlc price\n- dlc (basicly the same bikes, but 2015)\n- buggines\n- poor optimization\n\nMediums:\n~overall graphics\n~physics (those weelies :/ )\n\n(PL)\nJak ktoś na YT powiedział, ta gra jest jak gdyby forza spotkała motocykle\nWięcc. głównie grafika jest zła\n\n1) Grywalność\nLepsza niż MotoGP (jak dla mnie), choć jej tylko motogp 14 z innymi motorami i torami , nie tylko torowe (więcej typowo ulicznych modeli). Wielkie możliwości dostosowanie motocykli, a także kierowcy (shitloaaaddd ubrań, np. Kaski, rękawice).\n\n2) Grafika\nCo do grafiki ....\nwięc, przynajmniej jej optymalizacja jest w porządku (prawie), działa na mojej 860m 4gb na ultra (tylko motion blur wyłączony), w 4096x2160 przy około 24fps (nie dużo, ale jak na grę tego typu, jest w porządku , to nie FPS, tylko gra wyścigowa)\nCo do 1920x1080, fps jest bardzo stabilny, nawet moja grafa obniżyła taktowanie i zablokowała się przy 48fps (monitor 48Hz)\nNajgorsze w grafice to to że, chociaż i ustawię ją na ultra, z "High Res textures" i 4k res, dużo tekstur nawet nie wygląda jakby próbowały być FullHD, nawet menu jest spikselowane (jak i ekran ładowania), textury jak np. przykrywkapojemnika płynu hamulcowego to tylko MASYWNE piksele\n\n3) Fizyka\nJeśłi chodzi o fizykę, to gra jest w porządku, ale najlepsza (co prawda ciężko wyprodukować symulator motocyklowy). W motocyklowej rzeczywistości jest nieco inaczej, ale tu można przyzwyczaić się do gry. Najgorszy jest czynnik wheelie (jazdy na kole). Tak, to jest tam, ale ...\ncóż..ehm .. jest bardzo zła, nawet w fizyce pro.\n\n4) Bugi ... Głównym powodem, dla którego daje to 9/10, że nie ma wiele błędów, ale gdy po prostu rozpoczną swoje działanie, będziesz mieć trudny czas. Gra działa całkiem dobrze, ale od pewnego czasu przestała działać (ładowanie toru trwa do wiecznośććć)\n\nWięc Tak, plusy i minusy:\n+ Czynnik Zabawy\n+ Nie tylko motocykle torowe\n+ Dostosowanie motorów, i kierowcy\n+ Mniejsze motory (250cc)\n\nWady:\nCena (80zł w porównaniu do 20zł za MotoGP 14)\n- Cena dlc\n- Dlc (w zasadzie te same motory, ale 2015)\n- Błędy\n- Słaba optymalizacja\n\nPośredniki:\n~ ogólna grafika\n~ fizyka (ta :jazda na jednym" :/)","July 31, 2015","true","22.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Where to even start. Let me start with my background. I am a sim racing fan and I ride a sport bike and motocross in real life. I also play all other types of games. If you enjoyed tourist trophy, then keep playing it. It is WAY better than this game. If you don't like sim games, then still don't play this game. It is just THAT bad. RIDE is no where near a motobike sim and is still bad at being an arcade racing game.\n\nCons:\n-Limited controller key mapping. You HAVE to assign every button and it HAS to be on the controller. Normally not a problem but if you are familiar with bike racing games you know how important this can be. Also you can't change buttons after you have started a race. You have to quit and go back to the main menu.\n-Horrible physics, no high sides, no low sides, bikes don't feel heavy at all. No side to side leaning.\n-twitchy turning, as soon as you touch the stick the bike twitches then gets a bit smoother after, but just feels totally wrong. Even if you barely touch it.\n-TERRIBLE performance. 980ti with major lag and frame drops. ARE YOU ♥♥♥♥ING KIDDING ME. And the graphics aren't even good.

You don't hold back since you're not afraid of crashing and all the adrenaline/excitement rushes in because you can go full out. You dominate the race and are ahead of everyone else. Yet, you get the feeling that you want to 'overtake' every section of the track itself. It's no longer about beating the competition, you're the competition" -Me on Ride gameplay.\n\n\nI was foreign to the world of motorbikes because I never able appreciated riding one. I played one of the first motogp game in around 2000 and I loved the game very much though. Recently, I tried Milestone's MotoGP14 and despite the lack of support for the game I loved it! I still think riding a motobike is a dangerous and risky business but I can appreciate the thrill and freedom of bike riding.\n\nAll this brought me to RIDE. I almost passed on buying until I saw a youtube video clip showing a tuned bike excellently ridden.\n\nNow that I have tried RIDE, I want to share my opinion of the game to help you decide. Overall, the game is good especially if you're a motorbike lover. However, it still lacks tracks to race in in my opinion. The game forces you to start with one of 3 naked bikes and I thought it was rather uncool to force you to start with a specific type of bike. That being said, the progression until you buy a new bike that you like is quick and I now have realized that naked bikes aren't that bad actually.\n\nThe game allows you to buy parts for your bikes from aesthetic parts to performance enhancing ones. It also allows you to customize your rider avatar's face and gears (apparel) as well.\n\nThe game feels easy to play even with pro physics and no assists especially if you compare it to MotoGP 14. It could be because the bikes are slower than those in MotoGP. But this brought a more arcade feeling to the game than Milestone's MotoGP 14.\n\nOther than the lack of tracks the only other gripe I have is the inability to select the number of laps in any race we participate in (with the exception of online games).\n\nDo note that there's no weather in game neither is day/night setting. I think every track is set to certain pre-programmed time setting. Milestone has a habit of giving you just good enough game without trying to make it really superb.\n\nOnline is enjoyable too with stangers or even more with friends.\n\nUPDATE 2 APRIL 2015\nNow that I have spent more on the game I have more to share.\n\nThe difficulty of the game increases as you upgrade from lower powered bikes to higher ones. Riding a supersport bike may be too easy compared to riding a motoGP bike in Milestone's other game but riding a modern superbike is not so easy. In fact it can feel a bit too difficult. That is until you adapt to the changes.\n\nWheelie and stoppie happen a lot when you ride a bike with respectable horsepower unless you turn anti wheelie option to full (modern bikes have that tech actually!). Wheelie forces you to go easy on the throttle thus slowing you down despite  the bike's increased power rating. Opening up on the throttle aggresively will slow you down as your bike performs unintended wheelies.\n\nFurthermore, the game has its fair share of bugs and performance issues. Custom bike settings are not remembered forcing you to load your bike setting before every race which is annoying.\n\nStutters can happen if you set the VRAM to auto which is the default setting.\n\nThe game crashes to desktop when you try to  exit and sometimes when loading it just freezes although the likely occurence of the later is not that high.\n\nPerhaps one of the most annoying bug is that rewind doesn't always work and when it doesn't it costs you the race thus in-game money, prestige and REAL free time\n\nUPDATE 3 April 2015\nJust want to add that many people mention the sounds of the bikes are not that good but to me ithey are decent enough. When you use helmet view, sounds are muffled a bit which is very nice and thoughful. You could also hear the whizzing of air past you....which is also muffled if you're in helmet view. Each bike sounds distinct enough although you can't quite immerse yourself in the feeling of raw power when hearing your engine purring and roaring as you race. But the sounds are decent enough.\n\nOne of the best things in Ride is the inclusion of older bikes. These are a thrill to ride and race. You get to understand the advancement in motorbike technology as you try bikes from different eras. Most of the older bikes are from the mid 1990s and all throughout the first decade of the 21st century. Bike lovers will understand that they are riding not to show off or to indulge their prestige/ego by riding an expensive sport bike but for the enjoyment and thrill of riding it. Thus, being able to race these older bikes is awesome.\n\nOverall, this is a fun game and that's all that matters. Yes it is easier than Milestone's previous MotoGP 14 game but it's way more fun.\n\nUPDATE MULTIPLAYER\nThe multiplayer part is a blast in this game. It's made in such a way that your own riding is not affected by the ping response to the host. Your fellow players may rubber band if you have bad ping to the host but your experience of the race is flawless. This made it such that your result is almost not affected by the quality of your ping to the host's pc.\n\nIt's a lot of fun playing with other people. And way safer too. ;)","March 28, 2015","true","105.6"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","46","6","13","2","0"

Generally speaking it's ok to good game, but it definitely has it's flaws. First is graphics. They do look good ingame, but optimization is quite poor, because it really isn't that "special" looking game. Also very rushed feel comes from ie. loading screens with are hilariously poor looking compared to other parts of game. Gameplay wise it's mixed bag. I was expecting it to be more simulation as I recall very old SuperBike games from Miles being (they were excellent). This is however isn't luckily build with completely arcade feel. But I started with "simulation" settings with first class bikes and where struggling to get races through at the beginning as races felt quite hard for me. Then managed to finish this class I could buy one of the most fastest bikes in game, tune it pretty much and it was very big surprise as races in this superbike class felt dirt easy if player has even slight control of gas.\n\nOh yeah, and being enthusiast aimed game. WHERE THE HELL IS IOMTT?!? I would give this 9/10 IF it would include IOMTT track. With out it I'll give RIDE and solid 7/10\n\nPlease, please add IOM track as and DLC.

This makes the game feel like more of a showcase than a racing game.\n\nGameplay 6.4/10\nPros: The ability to use an "in helmet view" is awesome as well as the settings to change the "physics" of the bike (easy, medium and hard to be put simply). The amount of customization for both the bike and rider is decent with a hint of riding personalisation that comes with the "stance" of your rider that can be customised in the settings.\n\nCons: CONTROLLER SUPPORT. The deadzone for controllers is rediculously small. Yet again its another bike game where the movement of the bike does NOT fit in with the movement of the stick sitting on your thumb. The AI is boring to play against almost like exact copies of each other with no variation in riding styles. The online system to sign up is confusing and I actually had to go into the forums to work out how to play online (Next gen?).\n\n\nThere is much more but tbh I cannot be bothered writting it. I love motorbikes and have been a rider since I was a kid, razed by a family or riders. So if you love bikes you might enjoy this game for that reason. But if bikes are not your passion and you just want a racing game.

Clearly they want to do something spectacular and they change mind in the middle. But as I said if some flows will be addressed, especially technical mistakes regarding to bikes, ill be happy.\nAt the moment is fine but for rider/motorcyclist something will be missing.\nFor example; tuning bike is ok but some models already have top suspension or wheels and there is no point to do that. There is nothing about "riding modes" which quite few bikes have and would be nice to have them in the game for sake of authenticity.\nEngine as graphics could be much better. Is nowhere near CoD or Forza and I can't set it any higher so it's not hardware problem.\nAnd sound. Sound of bikes is not even close to the real life, I understand that all of those problems can be resolved with money, so hopefuly after success of this game the sequel will be much better.","March 28, 2015","true","19.9"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

Shaner","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198087408420/","67 products in account","So far, I've got o say Ride hit the mark on a niche role that the MotoGP games weren't filling.\n\nPros:\n-Over 100 bikes\n-Over 400 different paint jobs\n-from 390-1200cc bikes\n-Naked bikes/sports/supersports/superbikes/track bikes/prototypes\n-The actual gameplay feels smooth (when you use correct graphic settings)\n-Can change things like fender eliminators and mirror elminators, tires, lever colors, triple clamp colors.\n-Rider gear can be custumized from helmet (they even have my skin of the AGV K3), gloves, boots, suits, pants, and jackets\n-Riding position can be made custom, and that's really cool little feature for me personally\n-You can REALLY feel the difference in bikes. Went form an R6 600cc bikes to the Ducati Penigale 1199s, and it took about 5-8 races for me to actually get used to the feel of the Duc. I power wheeied up several times, hit the throttle too hard out of corners and slid out. Things I was doing that aren't always good practice (powering early out of turns, opening wide up in lower gears) were fine on the R6, but on the Duc, double the power it was very clear that I had to race much cleaner.\n\n\n\nCons:\n\n-I feel the "Racing Line" they have is a tad off at times, there's definitely points where I can clearly break after it tells me to/lines that are more optimal to take wide/short. Looking at you Road America\n-The racing line isn't always clear on when to lean, Often times I can go early to get a jump on the apex. While other times if I turn when it wants me to I'll come up short on the turn.\n-The starting bikes are incredibly lopsided. I went with the 636 Monster, and it was a clear loser to the speed triple. I struggled very much to even finish on the podium with the Ducati. But when I started over, with the triple, it was a walk in the park to finish top.\n-I don't feel the tracks are varied enough in world tour mode. I've seen Road America, Imola, and Miami plenty of times. I've only seen Wales once, and yet to see Sierra Nevada.\n-I wish they did more with the salt flats track, It's a big relaxer to just drag it up, but I think they could do a little more with it. Maybe a mode where you try to beat your top speed?\n-Bike damage is nonexistant, I'd like to see a hardcore mode.\n\nOverall, I think Ride is shaping up to be the niche motorcycle riders, enthusiants, and race enthusiants are looking for.\nHowever, there are minor tweaks that need to be made, and some content as far as tracks go I'd love to see added (Isle of Man TT [PLEASE, even if it's just a segement of the track] , Leguna Seca, Catalunya, Mugello).\n\nFor now, I'd give it an 8/10, hopefully Milestone actually sticks with this to provice patches, and new content.\n\nFor $40, I'd say it's definitely a save bet for any motorcycle rider.","March 28, 2015","true","72.0"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

It had such an oppurtunity to be a fantastic game, unfortunately, it's fallen flat on it's face.\nLet me explain, now, Ride, as you might guess is a production motorbike racing game. Something I have been wanting for ages.\n\nThe problems start at the thing the game is about, motorbikes. Or the lack there of.\n\n***CONS***\n\n- Now we have some bikes on here for sure, don't get me wrong. But we are missing some essentials. Hayabusa, ZXR1400, etc. The bigger bikes.\n\n- The sounds of the bikes. Some are pretty good, others? Crap. I mean really, really bad. The 2 strokes? They sound like a smaller 4 stroke. Annoying.\n\n- Stuttering, low FPS around corners. It runs at 60FPS constant until it suddenly decides to dip to around 10. Usually happens when going around corners.\nRIG:\nIntel i5 4670K\nGTX 690\n8GB 1866Mhz bla bla bla\n\n- Sometimes you come off for no reason. It just happens. You'll be flung off your bike, for apparently no reason. No idea why, but you do.\n\n- Menu's are not good. Pretty ugly, slow, not very well laid out.\n\n- Small one, but very annoying for me, changing your exhaust doesn't effect the sound of the bike at all.\n\n- The AI seem almost impossible to knock off, where as you come off very easily.\n\n- The walls can sometimes just push you off your bike even if you aren't touching them.\n\n- You cannot practise, or even qualify for a race. You are straight into it. This is so annoying.\n\n- Not much customization for bikes. When you first play it, it seems like a lot. But then you realise, most of it is the same for every bike. I'd like more exhausts, own decals, racing fairing, that sort of thing.\n\nBut now the good bits.\n\n***PROS***\n\n- The ability to change your ride style. How far you lean, how far you tilt your head, the lot.\n\n- Being able to change your kit.\n\n- There is nothing else like it. The closest is Tourist Trophy back on PS2.\n\nTL;DR\nI don't like it.","July 30, 2015","false","65.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This setting seemed to work well and would jump between 30fps-48ish, with only a few tracks and sections of the game dropping to unplayable fps.\n\nI recently installed windows 10 and tried the game again. with everythign set to high and AA at 2x ( for now ) I get a constant 50fps. have played about 7 races on different tracks and had no trouble at all. Defnitely an improvement.\n\nThe game itself is great. looks beautiful, bikes sound awesome and the game play is fun.\n\nIf you've had trouble with the game in the past, give it a go with windows 10 and see if that helps. I'm not saying it will make it better, but it appears that way on my system.\n\nenjoy,\n\nM\n\nI ran the game using an fx 6300 / R9 290x,  hopefully that helps you make a judgment on how it may  run with your spec.","August 2, 2015","true","20.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Only thing I miss is the proper tutorial for people who don't know squat about bike racing like me. The in-game tutorial is very short and only explains the game mechanics, but tells you nothing about physics and track racing. I actualy own the bike and ride on it casualy, but obviously have no experience with this type of tyres, riding at top speeds or sharp leaning and I would welcome the game to be more lenient towards amateurs. 9/10 otherwise","February 28","true","4.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Not entirely but to some degree it has. In terms of gameplay this game is fantastic, going round corners at god knows what speed looks and feels awesome, the physics seem lifelike (from what I can tell), and it is genuinely challenging if you turn up the AI difficulty and turn the assists off. Racing in this game is by far the best fun I've had in a video game this year. The only thing that's bad about the gameplay is the godawful engine sounds. The Aprillia RS250 sounds like the various speeds on a marital aid as you go up through the revs, the Suzuki GSXR1000 K5 sounds muffled, as if you've got your ears plugged and all of the V-Twin Ducati's just sound boring. One of the most significant things about a motorcycle is that they resemble what hell would sound like, not what a hairdryer sounds like. Aside's from the barely viable engine sounds, the gameplay is fantastic.\n\nThe menu's however are not. Sure, the backgrounds are pretty, but the text and text boxes are just bland. Navigating the menu's is like trying to force spaghetti up a cat's backside. I have spent a good 3 out of my current 16.7 hours playing this game sidescrolling left and right, be it trying to choose/upgrade a bike, pick an event or simply change my character's helmet. However, ironically, when you're about to purchase yourself a new motorcycle and you go to pick a manufacturer to choose from, all of said manufacturer's are laid out in a nice, easy to navigate grid menu, yet once you pick your desired motorcycle manufacturer you go back to the slow, dimwitted sidescrolling mess that they call a  menu, it's like being stuck in a world of Soup with only a fork. Why is that simple, easy to use grid menu not implemented in ANY OF THE OTHER MENU'S?\n\nSo in conclusion, if you manage to make it through the seven levels of menu hell and start a race, you will enjoy yourself. Hopefully they'll improve the engine sounds because right now they barely resemble anything that combusts.\n\nTL:DR\nGameplay is good, apart from the poor engine sounds.\nMenus are difficult to navigate and as aesthetically pleasing as a small bowl of vomit balanced on Emma Watson's nose.","June 23, 2015","true","29.9"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","1"

Poor textures no matter how high you set them.\nControls - very bad, weight shifting doesn't seem to do anything, no popping wheelies with ease on this game.

I played SBK X for a while and I liked that one as well, IF you've played a milestone bike game you should feel at home.\nStill some problems with the not so realistic feel of the bike sometimes, I mean a bike is VERY nimble in real life, you can lean from one side to the other very quickly : in this game you have to change suspension settings to get closer to reality, and you get negative effects from that (less stability).\nStill this is acceptable and you can have a lot of fun.\n\nDoes not have a lot of tracks at the moment, which is strange because they already had them in earlier games (in SBK X and previous moto GP games you had most popular tracks like brno, mugello, mazda raceway laguna seca etc.\nA few open road tracks : need way more real open roads (and i mean not going in circles with laps, i mean a real road like there are sometimes in rally games)\n\nAlso city tracks , which I dont like so much (all 90° turn... it gets old)\n\nLots of bikes ! That's awesome. very well detailed, many categories like historical, naked, sportbikes, of all displacements.\nSome groups are unbalanced for racing (you get MT07 or 696 pitted against a 848 , I think they should categorize in relation with horsepower instead of displacement.)\nOther example in supersport category: 600cbr, 636 ninja, MV agusta 800 3 cylinder : too much difference in hp\n\nWasn't very expensive so I got what a paid for but.. I really hope they develop on this base because it could very well be a wonderful title.\nI won't hesitate to buy DLC's to expand on it (bikes, tracks)\n\nSo.. why do I not recommend it ?\n-Milestone is deaf and mute , PR is nowhere to be seen, many users have game breaking bugs and nothing happens\n-Loading screens are actually preventing me from launching the game right now, I mean it feels like playing playstation 1 back in the day","April 19, 2015","false","32.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The sounds are pretty bad (which is VERY important for a motorcycle game), but the bike graphics are good. The environmental graphics aren't the best but they are easy to ignore. Would very much like to see added customization, dramatically improved sounds (including the in-helmet muffling), a free ride mode (open worldish), weather, time of day, and CLUTCH CONTROL. There is currently no clutch control so you can't just pop a wheelie at anytime, but otherwise it is a fun game.

I'm only focusing on singleplayer experiences (havent tried multiplayer or even know if there is any!)\n\nPros\n- Its fun\n- customisation is good, but always room for more\n- nice range of bikes to try\n- mechanics/physics so far seem pretty solid\n- runs perfectly and smoothly\n\nCons\n- For me the AI arent aggressive or fast enough, i'm usually multiple seconds per lap faster on the hardest difficulty. They take some odd lines sometimes\n- Lacking tracks, would be nice to see some BSB circuits and real road races like NW200, IoMTT, PPIHC and Macau since we have the MotoGP game for the flagship grand prix circuits (although phillip island and mugello wouldnt go amiss)\n- Lack of support from the developers is quite alarming, its quite shocking really\n- Lack of Mod support\n- Sounds are a bit flat and generic, even for road bikes\n\nTo be frank, if the developers really cared about what the fans want, most of the issues i've highlighted could probably be resolved with mods, but from what i have read they repeatedly ignore constructive critisism to include things or fix issues and since i havent seen any issues yet all i can really say is theres no smoke without fire, and i hope if they don't fix or add stuff here then they will for RIDE2 if thats going to happen. Try the demo, buy it if you like it, you can always get a refund if you play under 2hours and run into issues.\n\nI'd rate RIDE 6/10 but i would only really reccommend it to bike fans, Its a good game and one of the better bike games going, but it won't stack up in terms of pure racing for people coming from car games if that makes sense. Add some more real decent tracks as outlined above, better audio and mod support and you would have a solid 9/10 bike game here, so its a shame really.","December 4, 2015","true","26.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you think you can ride a bike like you can drive a car, get a car game. I think RIDE is better than TT on PS3. Every mistake in RIDE results in a fall, not a bounce off a wall. If you are a biker, this game makes you think about your line through corners and your braking before corners, unless you've had track day practice. Really recommend it for anyone getting into biking for real. Remember a car moves your body, a bike moves your soul.\n\nAs for the performance aspect of this game on a PC, people just aren't setting it up appropriately. I've got a sucky rig now with an AMD X3 CPU an an ATI HD5850 GPU running Vista because I'm too tight to upgrade. It runs 1600 x 900 at 35fps in FRAPS with high detail texturing and 45 fps with low detail texturing.

The graphics are absolutely awesome  regarding bike models and ground textures, the enviroment outside the course itself tho is somewhat to be desired, but you buy a bike racing game to race bikes not to look at people in a crowd or a pretty little house. (i have a 4gb card so can use the 4gb textures).\n\nThe detailed customisation is brilliant too, you can even edit your riding stance completely, change elbow pitch,knee stretch etc.so far i have no complaints and am really enjoying this game. really love all the customisation and it features drag racing which is also awesome!  I certainly hope Milestone use this new approach to MXGP. big thumbs up here Milestone. The user interface however needs to display xbox overlay when you have the controller connected. I recommend this game defo. i just hope Milestone actually continue to update the game tho rather than ALL there previous titles! :) ignore the hater reviews. Just peoplethay don't know how to set their gfx settings properly for milestone games or people that hate milestone and criticise life. The physics are fine when you turn assists off and handle just like the moto gp games. My only gripe is the Xbox overlay not present and lack of clutch! I paid £18 for this tho on   k I n g u I n.net\n\nMy rig:\n\nI5 4690k\nMSI GTX 770 4GB\n16GB RAM\n\nIf you struggle with FPS and have an Nvidia card then i can give you my "Milestone Preset" which works perfect at 60fps.\n\nOverall i recommend this game :D","March 27, 2015","true","22.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","3"

With a controller not only can you modulate the gas, brakes, and turning angle in a fluid way (which is extremely important to get a clean line), but you also get force feedback-which adds to the experience immensley. Every shift has a little rumble to it, you can feel when your tires are reaching/passing their grip threshold, and it's much easier to tell when you're close to the wall/another rider. I would not bother playing this game without one.\nPROTIP FOR NEXT GAME- VR/steam controller native suppourt would be amazing.\n\nPros:\n-Good graphics, Excellent detail in all of the bike models, all the way down to the proper speedo/tach layout.\n-The tracks are fun and challenging, once again a lot of work went into making sure everything felt real, right down to the skidmarks on the road. Additional tracks would be nice, even as dlc(pikes peak pls). The crowds are your standard racing game low detail model but that really isn't why one plays the game.\n-A decent amount of character customization and an excellent amount of riding style customization. I was amazed when I figured out how tweakable this was.\n-The reverse function is super helpful when having issues with a certain corner. It allows you to reverse approximately the last 15 seconds and even change cameral angles to figure out exactly what the issue is. This feature should be in every racing game\n-The first person perspective inside the helmet is very involving. The sensation of speed has been translated very well to a video game, even including accurate sounding wind buffeting, blurring of vision and helmet shaking.\n-The mechanics, for the most part, are faithfully accurate to motorcycling. Using the brakes properly has been the hardest thing for me to figure out but I am starting to get it. *Big asterisk* There is no clutch control, which, while really only needed for starting, still removes a major component of a race, especially in drag races. This would be an awesome addition to subsequent games.\n-Extensive motorcycle roster--includes basically every major production superbike and naked bike from 2015 - INCLUDING THE MOTHERF***ING LIGHTNING 218 OMGGGGGG. All bikes have all the main customization options that are normally changed. I wish the was a bit more variety of options in a few areas, namely tires and rims but that really isn't an issue.\n-A decent amount of bike setup customization including, preload, spring stiffness, and preload with the top tier suspension, and full gearbox ratio customization with the top tier gearbox. *Things to add* Steering angle, more levels of gearbox and suspension customization, rear swingarm length, steering dampener settings, ecu timing and fueling, new throttle profiles, and EXTREMELY IMPORTANTLY, the ability to change settings on the fly to feel the difference and make it easier to experiment with different setups to find what works for you. It's annoying to have to go through three loading screens everytime you want to make an adjustment. A dyno would be nice too.\n\nCons, and there are a few big ones:\n-THE BIGGEST PROBLEM WITH THIS GAME--Bike sound. While the sounds of different bikes vary appropriately according to displacment, engine arrangement, and exhaust, it's very obvious that not much money was put toward making the bikes sound real. When you're making a game with the sole intent of creating the most accurate bike simulator out there, this is hugely important. Does it do the job? Yes, I can shift at the proper time based on the sound. Does it add to the experience? NO. It most definitely removes from it. All the bikes have this wierd low quality synthesizer-esque sound that is just bad. I almost didn't buy the game because of this. The exhaust and intake systems should also have a more realistic effect on the overall sound.\n-Controller integration, while superb with actual gameplay, does not properly transfer to the replay and picture taking functions. There is no way for me to save screenshots, which might be an issue with keyboards as well. Many of the main and contextual menus do not properly display controller buttons. Also, RB is reserved for the chat function which I'm sure most people will not be using--especially in the MIDDLE OF A RACE. Complete absurdity.\n-No way to practice on a track in career mode-just an extra hassle and a few loading screens to switch to time trial but nevertheless annoying for something that is so essential to the game.\n-No real sense of career progression at least in this point in the game. It feels like there's just a bunch of tracks that I will eventually win. The player should start out in low stakes, low displacement, public, ametur races and have to work their way up to the big leagues. The amount of money you get from even the lowest tier career mode races is enough to buy a new bike every 2-3 races. While it's nice to have access to the coolest bikes right from the get go it cheapens their value. All bikes should be available outside of career mode, but you should really have to work to earn them inside it.\n-Mirrors do not function\n\nAdditional ways for the game to be improved:\n-More extensive career mode. Sponsorship, factory and private teams, custom works parts, rivalries, greater acceptance of non-podium spots(to encourage playing on harder modes), qualifying, no restarts on official races(although I feel the rewind function to be neccesary to deal with the random crap that comes with the fact that this is a simulation and not real life), better integration of team members, multiple seasons, and more varied lengths of races are some ways to improve this.\n-Tire, brake pad, slider, and chain wear would all be nice to see in addition to the already existing need to replace oil every few races (which is a nice touch)\n-More bike customization options. Super/Turbocharging, Fuel injection system hardware, High-compression heads and forged pistons and cranks, different camshaft profiles, frame sliders, and more Colour options. Only being allowed to use the factory available colours is pretty crappy.\n-Easier to navigate menus. Mostly evident in the bike customization menu, categories with many colour options are all one massive list. The different styles should be listed independently of colour selection.\n-A drafting element\n-A NFSU2 style free roam would be neat\n\nTL;DR\nA good game provided you can get past the sound. A lot of attention to detail even though this game doesn't seem to have been made on a large budget. Mechanics are good but must be played with a controller. If you like motorcycles and video games, buy it.\n\n\n\n","March 29","true","19.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The graphics are absolutely awesome  regarding bike models and ground textures, the enviroment outside the course itself tho is somewhat to be desired, but you buy a bike racing game to race bikes not to look at people in a crowd or a pretty little house. (i have a 4gb card so can use the 4gb textures).\n\nThe detailed customisation is brilliant too, you can even edit your riding stance completely, change elbow pitch,knee stretch etc.so far i have no complaints and am really enjoying this game. really love all the customisation and it features drag racing which is also awesome!  I certainly hope Milestone use this new approach to MXGP. big thumbs up here Milestone. The user interface however needs to display xbox overlay when you have the controller connected. I recommend this game defo. i just hope Milestone actually continue to update the game tho rather than ALL there previous titles! :) ignore the hater reviews. Just peoplethay don't know how to set their gfx settings properly for milestone games or people that hate milestone and criticise life. The physics are fine when you turn assists off and handle just like the moto gp games. My only gripe is the Xbox overlay not present and lack of clutch! I paid £18 for this tho on   k I n g u I n.net\n\nMy rig:\n\nI5 4690k\nMSI GTX 770 4GB\n16GB RAM\n\nIf you struggle with FPS and have an Nvidia card then i can give you my "Milestone Preset" which works perfect at 60fps.\n\nOverall i recommend this game :D","March 27, 2015","true","22.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","3"

With a controller not only can you modulate the gas, brakes, and turning angle in a fluid way (which is extremely important to get a clean line), but you also get force feedback-which adds to the experience immensley. Every shift has a little rumble to it, you can feel when your tires are reaching/passing their grip threshold, and it's much easier to tell when you're close to the wall/another rider. I would not bother playing this game without one.\nPROTIP FOR NEXT GAME- VR/steam controller native suppourt would be amazing.\n\nPros:\n-Good graphics, Excellent detail in all of the bike models, all the way down to the proper speedo/tach layout.\n-The tracks are fun and challenging, once again a lot of work went into making sure everything felt real, right down to the skidmarks on the road. Additional tracks would be nice, even as dlc(pikes peak pls). The crowds are your standard racing game low detail model but that really isn't why one plays the game.\n-A decent amount of character customization and an excellent amount of riding style customization. I was amazed when I figured out how tweakable this was.\n-The reverse function is super helpful when having issues with a certain corner. It allows you to reverse approximately the last 15 seconds and even change cameral angles to figure out exactly what the issue is. This feature should be in every racing game\n-The first person perspective inside the helmet is very involving. The sensation of speed has been translated very well to a video game, even including accurate sounding wind buffeting, blurring of vision and helmet shaking.\n-The mechanics, for the most part, are faithfully accurate to motorcycling. Using the brakes properly has been the hardest thing for me to figure out but I am starting to get it. *Big asterisk* There is no clutch control, which, while really only needed for starting, still removes a major component of a race, especially in drag races. This would be an awesome addition to subsequent games.\n-Extensive motorcycle roster--includes basically every major production superbike and naked bike from 2015 - INCLUDING THE MOTHERF***ING LIGHTNING 218 OMGGGGGG. All bikes have all the main customization options that are normally changed. I wish the was a bit more variety of options in a few areas, namely tires and rims but that really isn't an issue.\n-A decent amount of bike setup customization including, preload, spring stiffness, and preload with the top tier suspension, and full gearbox ratio customization with the top tier gearbox. *Things to add* Steering angle, more levels of gearbox and suspension customization, rear swingarm length, steering dampener settings, ecu timing and fueling, new throttle profiles, and EXTREMELY IMPORTANTLY, the ability to change settings on the fly to feel the difference and make it easier to experiment with different setups to find what works for you. It's annoying to have to go through three loading screens everytime you want to make an adjustment. A dyno would be nice too.\n\nCons, and there are a few big ones:\n-THE BIGGEST PROBLEM WITH THIS GAME--Bike sound. While the sounds of different bikes vary appropriately according to displacment, engine arrangement, and exhaust, it's very obvious that not much money was put toward making the bikes sound real. When you're making a game with the sole intent of creating the most accurate bike simulator out there, this is hugely important. Does it do the job? Yes, I can shift at the proper time based on the sound. Does it add to the experience? NO. It most definitely removes from it. All the bikes have this wierd low quality synthesizer-esque sound that is just bad. I almost didn't buy the game because of this. The exhaust and intake systems should also have a more realistic effect on the overall sound.\n-Controller integration, while superb with actual gameplay, does not properly transfer to the replay and picture taking functions. There is no way for me to save screenshots, which might be an issue with keyboards as well. Many of the main and contextual menus do not properly display controller buttons. Also, RB is reserved for the chat function which I'm sure most people will not be using--especially in the MIDDLE OF A RACE. Complete absurdity.\n-No way to practice on a track in career mode-just an extra hassle and a few loading screens to switch to time trial but nevertheless annoying for something that is so essential to the game.\n-No real sense of career progression at least in this point in the game. It feels like there's just a bunch of tracks that I will eventually win. The player should start out in low stakes, low displacement, public, ametur races and have to work their way up to the big leagues. The amount of money you get from even the lowest tier career mode races is enough to buy a new bike every 2-3 races. While it's nice to have access to the coolest bikes right from the get go it cheapens their value. All bikes should be available outside of career mode, but you should really have to work to earn them inside it.\n-Mirrors do not function\n\nAdditional ways for the game to be improved:\n-More extensive career mode. Sponsorship, factory and private teams, custom works parts, rivalries, greater acceptance of non-podium spots(to encourage playing on harder modes), qualifying, no restarts on official races(although I feel the rewind function to be neccesary to deal with the random crap that comes with the fact that this is a simulation and not real life), better integration of team members, multiple seasons, and more varied lengths of races are some ways to improve this.\n-Tire, brake pad, slider, and chain wear would all be nice to see in addition to the already existing need to replace oil every few races (which is a nice touch)\n-More bike customization options. Super/Turbocharging, Fuel injection system hardware, High-compression heads and forged pistons and cranks, different camshaft profiles, frame sliders, and more Colour options. Only being allowed to use the factory available colours is pretty crappy.\n-Easier to navigate menus. Mostly evident in the bike customization menu, categories with many colour options are all one massive list. The different styles should be listed independently of colour selection.\n-A drafting element\n-A NFSU2 style free roam would be neat\n\nTL;DR\nA good game provided you can get past the sound. A lot of attention to detail even though this game doesn't seem to have been made on a large budget. Mechanics are good but must be played with a controller. If you like motorcycles and video games, buy it.\n\n\n\n","March 29","true","19.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

To me it looked almost identical to Forza Motorsports for motorcycles. Kind of a simulator but designed to have arcade abilities to enable less experienced sim folk to enjoy. Well I eventually give up after a year of watching everyone else get it . Time goes on and I build a PC and sure enough here it is. I get excited and make my purchase. I am ready to delve in to deep upgrades and competitive racing enjoying the real sounding and feeling machines so I thought.\nWhat I will complement them on is the 3rd person view and graphics in most cases seem pretty decent but it ends there. Upon starting the game for the first time I realize that the amount of options to enhance graphics or disable depending on your build was absolutely pathetic. The online doesnt work at all despite it telling you you have created a valid account. It just keeps telling me "failed to authenticate" which is dismal to say the least. For the sake of a short"ish" review I will move on and not get too hung up.\nNow I am in the game and buy my first bike. The sound is nothing like the real thing and obviously it looks like a stock bike so I head on over to the garage to upgrade and maybe see some info on my bike. By the way the dealership completely sucks. It has no interaction or detail. Its just 5 bar stats going from 0-10 and basic specs. Well inside the parts list I realize there are only oil change, port work in two stages, two brands of exhaust (and obviously Akropovic paid the higher dollar to have their exhaust used here because their exhausts give way more power which is completely wrong in the real world) and wait for it.......... two brands of air filter. The supposive "customize your machine" is a load of crock also. You can change brake lines, remove fender eliminator, and pick between usually two to three factory colors for your machine. Not even a paint shop on this game its so plain and empty.\nThe mechanics of the game seem to be very similar to MotoGP while on the track excluding the tire slippage and spinning are lacking in a realistic way. There is no clutch option at all. The tuning is also a joke. Its pretty much a slider bar for five basic catagories of suspension and a few on and off switches for TCS . I think you are stuck in ABS on .  The boards become old quickly because there isnt many and the ones that are there are just the same things. I also noticed a stock bike on the drag strip is just as competitive as a "completely modified" version. Everything costs the same for each bike also. I did notice the prices of the machines are around real world price but because the game gives you money so quickly you are in a top notch machine in less than an hour and no real feeling of any campaign or point system outside of a fake "world ranking" they give you that basically moves up a couple spots each time you win a race. The AI is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and bounces off walls or you and loves to cut you off frequently.\nOverall guys this game looked to be something huge so my hopes were high and I was completely let down. This felt far more like a demo or BETA than an actual game. I cant believe I paid 65$ for this. I doubt we see a Ride 2. Trust me by taking your money and going back to MotoGP and deal with no real upgrade system. At least then you get real simulation feeling and competitive racing. Overall 5 out of 10.\n","January 14","false","6.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

With a controller not only can you modulate the gas, brakes, and turning angle in a fluid way (which is extremely important to get a clean line), but you also get force feedback-which adds to the experience immensley. Every shift has a little rumble to it, you can feel when your tires are reaching/passing their grip threshold, and it's much easier to tell when you're close to the wall/another rider. I would not bother playing this game without one.\nPROTIP FOR NEXT GAME- VR/steam controller native suppourt would be amazing.\n\nPros:\n-Good graphics, Excellent detail in all of the bike models, all the way down to the proper speedo/tach layout.\n-The tracks are fun and challenging, once again a lot of work went into making sure everything felt real, right down to the skidmarks on the road. Additional tracks would be nice, even as dlc(pikes peak pls). The crowds are your standard racing game low detail model but that really isn't why one plays the game.\n-A decent amount of character customization and an excellent amount of riding style customization. I was amazed when I figured out how tweakable this was.\n-The reverse function is super helpful when having issues with a certain corner. It allows you to reverse approximately the last 15 seconds and even change cameral angles to figure out exactly what the issue is. This feature should be in every racing game\n-The first person perspective inside the helmet is very involving. The sensation of speed has been translated very well to a video game, even including accurate sounding wind buffeting, blurring of vision and helmet shaking.\n-The mechanics, for the most part, are faithfully accurate to motorcycling. Using the brakes properly has been the hardest thing for me to figure out but I am starting to get it. *Big asterisk* There is no clutch control, which, while really only needed for starting, still removes a major component of a race, especially in drag races. This would be an awesome addition to subsequent games.\n-Extensive motorcycle roster--includes basically every major production superbike and naked bike from 2015 - INCLUDING THE MOTHERF***ING LIGHTNING 218 OMGGGGGG. All bikes have all the main customization options that are normally changed. I wish the was a bit more variety of options in a few areas, namely tires and rims but that really isn't an issue.\n-A decent amount of bike setup customization including, preload, spring stiffness, and preload with the top tier suspension, and full gearbox ratio customization with the top tier gearbox. *Things to add* Steering angle, more levels of gearbox and suspension customization, rear swingarm length, steering dampener settings, ecu timing and fueling, new throttle profiles, and EXTREMELY IMPORTANTLY, the ability to change settings on the fly to feel the difference and make it easier to experiment with different setups to find what works for you. It's annoying to have to go through three loading screens everytime you want to make an adjustment. A dyno would be nice too.\n\nCons, and there are a few big ones:\n-THE BIGGEST PROBLEM WITH THIS GAME--Bike sound. While the sounds of different bikes vary appropriately according to displacment, engine arrangement, and exhaust, it's very obvious that not much money was put toward making the bikes sound real. When you're making a game with the sole intent of creating the most accurate bike simulator out there, this is hugely important. Does it do the job? Yes, I can shift at the proper time based on the sound. Does it add to the experience? NO. It most definitely removes from it. All the bikes have this wierd low quality synthesizer-esque sound that is just bad. I almost didn't buy the game because of this. The exhaust and intake systems should also have a more realistic effect on the overall sound.\n-Controller integration, while superb with actual gameplay, does not properly transfer to the replay and picture taking functions. There is no way for me to save screenshots, which might be an issue with keyboards as well. Many of the main and contextual menus do not properly display controller buttons. Also, RB is reserved for the chat function which I'm sure most people will not be using--especially in the MIDDLE OF A RACE. Complete absurdity.\n-No way to practice on a track in career mode-just an extra hassle and a few loading screens to switch to time trial but nevertheless annoying for something that is so essential to the game.\n-No real sense of career progression at least in this point in the game. It feels like there's just a bunch of tracks that I will eventually win. The player should start out in low stakes, low displacement, public, ametur races and have to work their way up to the big leagues. The amount of money you get from even the lowest tier career mode races is enough to buy a new bike every 2-3 races. While it's nice to have access to the coolest bikes right from the get go it cheapens their value. All bikes should be available outside of career mode, but you should really have to work to earn them inside it.\n-Mirrors do not function\n\nAdditional ways for the game to be improved:\n-More extensive career mode. Sponsorship, factory and private teams, custom works parts, rivalries, greater acceptance of non-podium spots(to encourage playing on harder modes), qualifying, no restarts on official races(although I feel the rewind function to be neccesary to deal with the random crap that comes with the fact that this is a simulation and not real life), better integration of team members, multiple seasons, and more varied lengths of races are some ways to improve this.\n-Tire, brake pad, slider, and chain wear would all be nice to see in addition to the already existing need to replace oil every few races (which is a nice touch)\n-More bike customization options. Super/Turbocharging, Fuel injection system hardware, High-compression heads and forged pistons and cranks, different camshaft profiles, frame sliders, and more Colour options. Only being allowed to use the factory available colours is pretty crappy.\n-Easier to navigate menus. Mostly evident in the bike customization menu, categories with many colour options are all one massive list. The different styles should be listed independently of colour selection.\n-A drafting element\n-A NFSU2 style free roam would be neat\n\nTL;DR\nA good game provided you can get past the sound. A lot of attention to detail even though this game doesn't seem to have been made on a large budget. Mechanics are good but must be played with a controller. If you like motorcycles and video games, buy it.\n\n\n\n","March 29","true","19.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Get it if you're a motorcycle fan.\n\nFull review:\nDoesn't honestly deserve the flak it gets.\n\nEncountered no save game issues, and the game runs buttery smooth on my rig. The bikes are beautifully modelled and rendered, and the engines sound fantastic on headphones. The tracks pass by fast enough while I'm riding that the supposed lower quality details do not stand out at all.\n\nRiders are believable and very well animated, and the amount of control finesse you can get over the bike is huge, from extremely hand-holdy assistance to letting you have full control over the brakes individually, and shifting gears manually.\n\nThe attention to detail is appreciable especially in the first person helmet view available, it even muffles the engine sound, simulating wearing a full-face helmet.\n\nThough no game can really ever come close to capturing the physical aspect of actually riding a motorcycle, RIDE does a respectable job of it. A solid purchase for motorcycle fanatics and riders, in my mind.","January 12","true","5.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you have stuttering just alt+tab then alt+tab back yourself in it helped me. But the funny thing is they shudve patched it months ago.\n\nIf you like bikes, no not like them louve them then i stronfly advise to buy the game coz theres no other bike racing games that have this beatiful graphics and tons of bikes.But after a few races you can buy anykind of bikes so the progression just feels empty after that.\n\nMy problem is the lack of street circuits.Or open worlded freerides. I would love to take my ride to a spin on the streets.\n\nNonetheless its a moderately good game, with a few different racing features.My favourite is when you duel with another racer among other casuals.That was the most fun that i had in the game.","December 26, 2015","true","17.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Clearly digital and not well done, IMO (not really a deal breaker though).\n\nThe negative side is that I have noticed a heap of frame drops, even though I play with a computer above recommended specs.\n\nGreat concept - just needs some improvement.","May 4","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Yes... at sale price.\nThe pros of this game is the basic gameplay, it's a really fun hybrid of arcade and sim that really nails the balance. It reminds me alot of the old MotoGP game from the early 2000s that leaned more towards sim racing. It has a good variety of bikes, could have used more tracks and variants to keep things fresh as you play.\nNow the problem is the content, it really isn't anything to write home about. It very much feels like a 90s game where gameplay was pretty much what you got. I'm comparing to modern racers where there is more than just racing. Think of that Gride game where there was a progression from season to season. Think of games like NFS shift (that this game borrows from a bit) where you had different categories you raced in. Yes you kind of have it in this where you race in different classes but it's not as well done. Think of how much customisation you get nowadays.\nBasically this is a nice game but quite bland. There aare still some bugs and glitches but nothign that broke gameplay or crashed the game for me. It's all just unpolished and could use more game modes and content.","May 16","true","22.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I ride a 2012 yzf-r6 as a weekend toy and this game is the closest I have ever played that comes close to the real thing. It can teach a lot of basic things like having a good roll on and learning to lean early into a turn, braking control and learning how to manage a wheelie. You start off wanting all the electronic assists on but end up using a RAW 2014 HP4 or YZF-R1 Race edition and feel like a Moto Gp Pro. I love this game but no where near as much as the real thing, but if you don't ride it will give you the itch like nothing I have ever played. Lol I am looking at getting a liter bike asap because I love riding the 2014 R1 in this game so much.
